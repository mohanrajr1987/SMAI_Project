I hook them up to the FirstViewController object in interface builder (that I created and set it's class to the same as the code file). I hooked everything up using <code>IBoutlets</code> and <code>IBActions</code>. </p>

<p>Everything was working fine, but then I made some changes in interface builder (added a <code>UILabel</code>) and now a method that is run when clicked (I ran through it with the debugger) has a line that adds a subview to the view controller, and it acts as if it wasn't executed. The method (and code is run through) is executed with no errors (per the debugger) but the view is simply not being added. This happened after I made some change via interface builder. </p>

<p>Now, if I hook-up my button to ""Selected First View Controller"" by clicking on the appropriate tab and dragging the <code>IBOutlet</code> to the <code>UILabel</code>, that label now has multiple referencing outlets. Now, if I do the same thing for the button, the method (the <code>IBAction</code>) is executed twice but the subview is actually added and displayed. But, I get a memory access error because my <code>IBAction</code> (button) method access a property that stores something. I am guessing this has to do with somehow creating the memory in the First View Controller but trying to access it in the Selected First View Controller? If that makes any sense?</p>

<p>I have no idea why this is happening and why it just the button suddenly stopped working. I tried to explain this problem the best I could, it is sort of confusing. But if anyone has any tips or ideas I would love to hear what you guys think about this problem and how to solve it.</p>

<p>My entire page (page and its referenced resources) is around 89K compressed.. which is slow over 3G in some spots and even worse over EDGE.  Incoming requests are at least indicating that it accepts compression (<code>accept-encoding=gzip, deflate</code>), so that's good I suppose.</p>

<p>I read <a href=""http://yuiblog.com/blog/2008/02/06/iphone-cacheability/"" rel=""nofollow"">this yui study</a>, which seems to indicate that the iPhone will cache 25k per item. The only thing referenced that is over 25k uncompressed is jquery (packed but uncompressed - it is 30k). Everything else should be cacheable.

<p>I downloaded Harrowprint.tff (downloaded from <a href=""http://www.dafont.com/harrowprint.font"">here</a>) and added it to my Resources directory and to the project. I then tried this code:</p>

<pre><code>UIFont* font = [UIFont fontWithName:@""Harrowprint"" size:20];

<p>which resulted in an exception being thrown. Looking at the TTF file in Finder confirmed that the font name was Harrowprint. </p>

<p>EDIT - there have been a number of replies so far which tell me to read the documentation on X or Y. I've experimented extensively with all of these, and got nowhere. In one case, X turned out to be relevant only on OS X, not on iPhone. Consequently I am setting a bounty for this question, and I will award the bounty to the first person who provides an answer (using only documented APIs) who responds with sufficient information to get this working on the device. Working on the simulator too would be a bonus. </p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT - it appears that the bounty auto-awards to the answer with the highest number of votes. Interesting. No one actually provided an answer that solved the question as asked - the solution that involves coding your own UILabel subclass doesn't support word-wrap, which is an essential feature for me - though I guess I could extend it to do so. </p>

<p>What has kept me from digging into it so far has being that it feels hard to figure out how to realize my idea of having ""glowing"", ""sparkling"" effects on some lamps. I used to be good at such things back in the days of the Amiga scene. But today I'm clueless. Now I can see that there are so many iPhone apps with completely stunning graphic effects. So. I'm wondering if someone knows about available libraries for creating those? Open source preferably, but I'm willing to pay some for it if it comes to that.</p>

<p>I'd like the <code>greetingLabel</code> to read ""Hello [nameTextField]"" as soon as the user presses any key.</p>

<p>What I need basically is the iPhone equivalent of the Cocoa delegate method <code>controlTextDidChange</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>textField:shouldChangeCharactersInRange:</code> delegate method is called each time a keystroke occurs:</p>

<p>I have the following:</p>

<ul>

<li>a MacBook</li>
<li>the iPhone SDK</li>
<li>Blender</li>
</ul>

<p>My knowledge base:</p>

<ul>
<li>I can make 3D models in various 3D programs (I'm most comfortable with 3D Studio Max, which I once took a course on, but I've used others)</li>
<li>General knowledge of procedural programming from years ago (QuickBasic - I'm old!)</li>
<li>Beginner's knowledge of object-oriented programming from going through simple Java and C# tutorials (Head Start C# book and my wife's intro to OOP course that used Java)</li>
<li>I have managed to display a 3D textured model and spin it using a tutorial in C# I got off the net (I didn't just copy and paste, I understand basically how it works) and the XNA game development library, using Visual Studio on Windows.</li>
</ul>

<p>What I do not know:</p>

<ul>
<li>Much about Objective C</li>
<li>Anything about OpenGL or OpenGL ES, which the iPhone apparently uses</li>
<li>Anything about XCode</li>
</ul>

<p>My main problem is that I don't know where to start! All the iPhone books I found seem to be about creating GUI applications, not OpenGL apps. I found an OpenGL book but I don't know how much, if any, applies to iPhone development. And I find the Objective C syntax somewhat confusing, with the weird nested method naming, things like ""id"" that don't make sense, and the scary thought that I have to do manual memory management.</p>

<p>Where is the best place to start? I couldn't find any tutorials for this sort of thing, but maybe my Google-Fu is weak. Or maybe I should start with learning Objective C? I know of books like Aaron Hillgrass', but I've also read that they are outdated and much of the sample code doesn't work on the iPhone SDK, plus it seems geared towards the Model-View-Controller paradigm which doesn't seem that suited for 3D apps.</p>

<p>Basically I'm confused about what my first steps should be. </p>

<p>My application needs to display text in either a <code>UIView</code> or <code>UILabel</code> but the back ground must be a gradient as opposed to a true <code>UIColor</code>. Using a graphics program to create desired look is no good as the text may vary depending on data returned from a server.</p>
