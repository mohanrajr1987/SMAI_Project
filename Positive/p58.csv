I have implemented <code>QueryPerformanceCounter</code> by giving the uSeconds since the process start up:  </p>

<pre><code>BOOL QueryPerformanceCounter(LARGE_INTEGER* performanceCount)
{
    gettimeofday(&amp;currentTimeVal, NULL);
    performanceCount-&gt;QuadPart = (currentTimeVal.tv_sec - startTimeVal.tv_sec);
    performanceCount-&gt;QuadPart *= (1000 * 1000);
    performanceCount-&gt;QuadPart += (currentTimeVal.tv_usec - startTimeVal.tv_usec);

    return true;

<p>This, coupled with <code>QueryPerformanceFrequency()</code> giving a constant 1000000 as the frequency, works well <b>on my machine</b>, giving me a 64 bit variable that contains <code>uSeconds</code> since the program's start up. So <em>is this portable?</em> I don't want to discover it works differently if the kernel was compiled in a certain way or anything like that. I am fine with it being non-portable to something other than Linux, however.</p>

<p>Nope, no serial numbers. The thing is, the problem persists even with sudo-running the python script, and the only thing that makes it go through if I open the connection in the gui tool that I mentioned.</p>

I am running on Ubuntu Hardy Heron, upgraded from Gutsy Gibbon.</p>

<p>Is there a configuration file I can update to tell the JRE to use Pacific with all the associated daylight savings time information?  The time on my machine shows correctly, so it doesn't seem to be an OS-wide misconfiguration.</p>

<hr>

<p>Ok, here's an update. A coworker suggested I update JAVA_OPTS in my /etc/profile to include ""-Duser.timezone=US/Pacific"", which worked (I also saw CATALINA_OPTS, which I updated as well). Actually, I just exported the change into the variables rather than use the new /etc/profile (a reboot later will pick up the changes and I will be golden).</p>

<p>However, I still think there is a better solution... there should be a configuration for Java somewhere that says what timezone it is using, or how it is grabbing the timezone. If someone knows such a setting, that would be awesome, but for now this is a decent workaround.</p>

<hr>

<p>I am using 1.5, and it is most definitely a DST problem.  As you can see, the time zone is set to not use daylight savings.  My belief is it is generically set to -8 offset rather than the specific Pacific timezone.  Since the generic -8 offset has no daylight savings info, it's of course not using it, but the question is, where do I tell Java to use Pacific time zone when it starts up?  I'm NOT looking for a programmatic solution, it should be a configuration solution.</p>

None of these boxes are especially critical and they're all using RAID.  To date, I've therefore been doing backups of the boxes by having a cron job upload tarballs containing the contents of /etc, MySQL dumps and other such changing, non-packaged data to a box at our geographically separate hosting centre.</p>

<p>I've realised, however that</p>

<ul>
<li>the tarballs are sufficient to rebuild from, but it's certainly not a painless process to do so (I recently tried this out as part of a hardware upgrade of one of the boxes)</li>
<li>long-term, the process isn't sustainable.  Each of the boxes is currently producing a tarball of a couple of hundred MB each day, 99% of which is the same as the previous day</li>
<li>partly due to the size issue, the backup process requires more manual intervention than I want (to find whatever 5GB file is inflating the size of the tarball and kill it)</li>
<li>again due to the size issue, I'm leaving stuff out which it would be nice to include - the contents of users' home directories, for example.  There's almost nothing of value there that isn't in source control (and these aren't our main dev boxes), but it would be nice to keep them anyway.</li>
<li>there must be a better way</li>
</ul>

<p>So, my question is, how should I be doing this properly?  The requirements are:</p>

<ul>
<li>needs to be an offsite backup (one of the main things I'm doing here is protecting against fire/whatever)</li>
<li>should require as little manual intervention as possible (I'm lazy, and box-herding isn't my main job)</li>
<li>should continue to scale with a couple more boxes, slightly more data, etc.</li>
<li>preferably free/open source (cost isn't the issue, but especially for backups, openness seems like a good thing)</li>
<li>an option to produce some kind of DVD/Blu-Ray/whatever backup from time to time wouldn't be bad</li>
</ul>

<p>My first thought was that this kind of incremental backup was what tar was created for - create a tar file once each month, add incrementally to it.  rsync results to remote box.  But others probably have better suggestions.</p>

<p>I figured I should give it a few hours before accepting an answer, since in this case there's no right or wrong answer, just answers that seem better or worse.  It's now 12 hours since I asked the question.  I'll be looking at Bacula in the first instance.  If that doesn't work out for me, I'll proceed to the other suggestions.</p>

The app actually consists of 2 parts, one runs on Windows and interacts with a user and another is a linux part that runs from a LiveCD. User makes a choice of Windows drive letters and then a linux part performs actions with corresponding partitions. The problem is finding a match between a Windows drive letter (like C:) and a linux device name (like /dev/sda1). This is my current solution that I rate as ugly:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>store partitions information (i.e. drive letter, number of blocks, drive serial number etc.) in Windows in some pre-defined place (i.e. the root of the system partition).</p></li>
<li><p>read a list of partitions from /proc/partitions. Get only those partitions that has major number for SCSI or IDE hard drives and minor number that identifies them as real partitions and not the whole disks.</p></li>
<li><p>Try to mount each of them with either ntfs or vfat file systems. Check whether the mounted partition contains the information stored by Windows app.</p></li>
<li><p>Upon finding the required information written by the Windows app make the actual match. For each partition found in /proc/partitions acquire drive serial number (via HDIO<em>GET</em>IDENTITY syscall), number of blocks (from /proc/partitions) and drive offset (/sys/blocks/drive<em>path/partition</em>name/start), compare this to the Windows information and if this matches - store a Windows drive letter along with a linux device name. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>There are a couple of problems in this scheme:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>This is ugly. Writing data in Windows and then reading it in Linux makes testing a nightmare.</p></li>
<li><p>linux device major number is compared only with IDE or SCSI devices. This would probably fail, i.e. on USB or FireWire disks. It's possible to add these types of disks, but limiting the app to only known subset of possible devices seems to be rather bad idea.</p></li>
<li><p>looks like HDIO<em>GET</em>IDENTITY works only on IDE and SATA drives.</p></li>
<li><p>/sys/block hack may not work on other than IDE or SATA drives.</p></li>

<p>I'm sorry for not making myself clear. Of course you're using a pipe and of course you're using stdin and stdout of the respective parts of the command. I had assumed that was too obvious to state.</p>

<p>What I'm asking is how this is handled/implemented. Since both programs cannot run at once, how is data sent from stdin to stdout? What happens if the first program generates data significantly faster than the second program? Does the system just run the first command until either it's terminated or it's stdout buffer is full, and then move on to the next program, and so on in a loop until no more data is left to be processed or is there a more complicated mechanism?</p>

<p>I could find these SO topics:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2756/lightweight-ide-for-linux"" rel=""nofollow"">Lightweight IDE for linux</a> and</li>
<li><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17228/what-tools-do-you-use-to-develop-c-applications-on-linux"" rel=""nofollow"">What tools do you use to develop
C++ applications on Linux?</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I'm not looking for a <em>lightweight</em> IDE. If an IDE is worth the money, then I will pay for it, so it need not be free.</p>

<p>My question, then:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>What good, C++ programming IDE is available for Linux?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The minimums are fairly standard: syntax highlighting, code completion (like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IntelliSense"" rel=""nofollow"">intellisense</a> or its Eclipse counterpart) and integrated debugging (e.g., basic
breakpoints).</p>

<p>I have searched for it myself, but there are so many that it is almost impossible to separate the good from the bads by hand, especially for someone like me who has little  C++ coding experience in Linux. I know that <a href=""http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/"" rel=""nofollow"">Eclipse supports C++</a>, and I really like that IDE for Java, but is it any good for C++ and is there something better?</p>

<p>The second post actually has some good suggestions, but what I am missing is what exactly makes the sugested IDE so good for the user, what are its (dis)advantages?</p>

<p>Maybe my question should therefore be:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>What IDE do you propose (given your experiences), and why?</em></p>

I am working on Linux machine and the FileMaker database is on the same LAN running on an OS X machine. I can log into the webby interface from my machine.</p>

<p>I'm quite handy with SQL, and if somebody could point me to some FileMaker plug-in that could give me SQL access to the data within FileMaker, I would be pleased as punch. Everything I've found only goes the other way: Having FileMaker get data from SQL sources. Not useful.</p>

<p>It's not my first choice, but I'd use Perl instead of Python if there was a Perl-y solution at hand.</p>

<p><em>Note</em>: XML/XSLT services (as suggested by some folks) are only available on FM Server, not FM Pro. Otherwise, that would probably be the best solution. ODBC is turning out to be extremely difficult to even get working. There is absolutely zero feedback from FM when you set it up so you have to dig through /var/log/system.log and parse obscure error messages.</p>

<p><em>Conclusion</em>: I got it working by running a python script locally on the machine that queries the FM database through the ODBC connections. The script is actually a TCPServer that accepts socket connections from other systems on the LAN, runs the queries, and returns the data through the socket connection. I had to do this to bypass the fact that FM Pro only accepts ODBC connections locally (FM server is required for external connections).</p>
