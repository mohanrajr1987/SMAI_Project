One of the nastier issues during my last years was keeping track of database schema changes and deploying these changes to productive systems. I haven't dared asking for being able to undo them too, but of course for testing and debugging that would be a great feature. From other questions here (such as <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1607/mechanisms-for-tracking-db-schema-changes"" rel=""nofollow"">this one</a> or <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/173/how-do-i-version-my-ms-sql-database-in-svn"" rel=""nofollow"">this one</a>), I can see that I'm not alone and that this is not a trivial problem.

Images in a photo gallery, products in a catalog, chapters in a book, etc.  Each object is represented as a row.  I want to be able to arbitrarily order these images, storing that ordering in the database so when I display the objects, they will be in the right order.</p>

<p>For example, let's say I'm writing a book, and each chapter is an object.  I write my book, and put the chapters in the following order:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Introduction, Accessibility, Form vs. Function, Errors, Consistency, Conclusion, Index</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It goes to the editor, and comes back with the following suggested order:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Introduction, Form, Function, Accessibility, Consistency, Errors, Conclusion, Index</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How can I store this ordering in the database in a robust, efficient way?</p>

<p>I've had the following ideas, but I'm not thrilled with any of them:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Array.  Each row has an ordering ID, when order is changed (via a removal followed by an insertion), the order IDs are updated.  This makes retrieval easy, since it's just <code>ORDER BY</code>, but it seems easy to break.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>// REMOVAL</code><br />
  <code>UPDATE ... SET orderingID=NULL WHERE orderingID=removedID</code><br />
  <code>UPDATE ... SET orderingID=orderingID-1 WHERE orderingID &gt; removedID</code><br />
  <code>// INSERTION</code><br />
  <code>UPDATE ... SET orderingID=orderingID+1 WHERE orderingID &gt; insertionID</code><br />
  <code>UPDATE ... SET orderID=insertionID WHERE ID=addedID</code></p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Linked list. Each row has a column for the id of the next row in the ordering.  Traversal seems costly here, though there may by some way to use <code>ORDER BY</code> that I'm not thinking of.</p></li>
<li><p>Spaced array.  Set the orderingID (as used in #1) to be large, so the first object is 100, the second is 200, etc.  Then when an insertion happens, you just place it at <code>(objectBefore + objectAfter)/2</code>.  Of course, this would need to be rebalanced occasionally, so you don't have things too close together (even with floats, you'd eventually run into rounding errors).</p></li>

<p>Now, I'm confused because afaik Unicode is not any particular representation, so what is a ""Unicode string"" in Python? Does that mean UCS-2? Googling turned up <a href=""http://www.reportlab.com/i18n/python_unicode_tutorial.html"">this ""Python Unicode Tutorial""</a> which boldly states</p>

  <p>Unicode is a two-byte encoding which covers all of the world's common writing systems.</p>

<p>which is plain wrong, or is it? I have been confused many times by character set and encoding issues, but here I'm quite sure that the documentation I'm reading is confused. Does anybody know what's going on in Python when it gives me a ""Unicode string""?</p>

I was already thinking this was too good to be true when I saw this in the <a href=""https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/django-admin/"">documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Syncdb will not alter existing tables</p>
  
  <p>syncdb will only create tables for models which have not yet been installed. It will never issue ALTER TABLE statements to match changes made to a model class after installation. Changes to model classes and database schemas often involve some form of ambiguity and, in those cases, Django would have to guess at the correct changes to make. There is a risk that critical data would be lost in the process.</p>
  
  <p>If you have made changes to a model and wish to alter the database tables to match, use the sql command to display the new SQL structure and compare that to your existing table schema to work out the changes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems that altering existing tables will have to be done ""by hand"".</p>

<p>What I would like to know is the best way to do this. Two solutions come to mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>As the documentation suggests, make the changes manually in the DB;</li>
<li>Do a backup of the database, wipe it, create the tables again (with syncdb, since now it's creating the tables from scratch) and import the backed-up data (this might take too long if the database is big)</li>
</ul>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

I have used Charles to confirm that all of the content -- the HTML, the images, the CSS, the javascript, <strong>everything</strong> is the same.</p>

<p>The ONLY difference in the traffic is that (because the local site is served from the Django development mode server) the response headers look like this:</p>

<pre><code>HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Server  WSGIServer/0.1 Python/2.5.2
Date    Thu, 04 Sep 2008 23:56:10 GMT 
Vary    Cookie
Content-Length  2301
Content-Type    text/html; charset=utf-8
</code></pre>

<p>Whereas on the staging server (where Django is running inside Apache) the headers look like this:</p>

<pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date    Thu, 04 Sep 2008 23:56:06 GMT
Server  Apache/2.2.8 (Ubuntu) mod_python/3.3.1 Python/2.5.2 PHP/5.2.4-2ubuntu5 with Suhosin-Patch
Vary    Cookie
Content-Length  2301
Content-Type    text/html; charset=utf-8
</code></pre>

<p>So, as far as I can tell the only differences are HTTP/1.1 vs HTTP/1.0, the server identifer (Apache vs WSGIServer) and the order of the Date/Server headers.</p>

<p>To elaborate a bit further on the differences in appearance, basically it appears as if the version of the site on the staging server is ""zoomed in"" by about 10%.  For example, the primary logo which dominates our home page is 220 pixels wide but when server from our staging server shows up as 245 pixels wide.  Everything else on the page, (other images, text, spacing, etc) is also proportionately larger.</p>

<p>This is all in Firefox 3.  I don't have any other browsers available to test with at the moment.</p>

The issue I'm having is that the page should work using the form's initial values (unbound), but I can't access the cleaned_data field unless I call is_valid(). But is_valid() always fails on unbound forms.</p>

<p>It seems like Django's forms were designed with the use case of editing data such that an unbound form isn't really useful for anything other than displaying HTML.</p>

<p>For example, if I have:</p>

<pre><code>if request.method == 'GET':
    form = MyForm()
else:
    form = MyForm(request.method.POST)

if form.is_valid():
    do_query(form.cleaned_data['start_date'], form.cleaned_data['end_date'])
</code></pre>

<p>is_valid() will fail if this is a GET (since it's unbound), and if I do:</p>

<pre><code>if request.method == 'GET':
    form = MyForm()
    do_query(form.cleaned_data['start_date'], form.cleaned_data['end_date'])
else:
    form = MyForm(request.method.POST)
    if form.is_valid():
       do_query(form.cleaned_data['start_date'], form.cleaned_data['end_date'])
</code></pre>

<p>the first call to do_query triggers exceptions on form.cleaned_data, which is not a valid field because is_valid() has not been called. It seems like I have to do something like:</p>

<pre><code>if request.method == 'GET':
    form = MyForm()
    do_query(form['start_date'].field.initial, form['end_date'].field.initial)
else:
    form = MyForm(request.method.POST)
    if form.is_valid():
       do_query(form.cleaned_data['start_date'], form.cleaned_data['end_date'])
</code></pre>

<p>that is, there isn't a common interface for retrieving the form's values between a bound form and an unbound one.</p>

<p>Django is a very productive framework for building content-heavy sites; the best I've tried and a breath of fresh air compared to some of the Java monstrosities out there. However it's written in Python which means there's little real support in the way of deployment/packaging, debugging, profilers and other tools that make building and maintaining applications much easier. </p>

<p>Ruby has similar issues and although I do like Ruby <strong>much</strong> better than I like Python, I get the impression that Rails is roughly in the same boat at Django when it comes to managing/supporting the app. </p>

<ul>
<li>Manage authentication,
authorization for
<strong>hundreds of thousands</strong> of <em>existing users</em> currently tightly integrated with a 3rd party vendor's application (We want to bust these users out into something we manage and make our apps work against it, plus our 3rd party vendors work against it).</li>
<li>Manage profile information linked to those users</li>
<li>Must be able to be accessed from any number of web applications on just about any platform (Windows, *nix, PHP, ASP/C#, Python/Django, et cetera).</li>
</ul>

<p>Here some sample implementations:</p>

<ul>
<li>LDAP/AD Server to manage everything. Use custom schema for all profile data.  Everything can authenticate against LDAP/AD and we can store all sorts of ACLs and profile data in a custom schema.</li>
<li>Use LDAP/AD for authentication only, tie LDAP users to a most robust profile/authorization server using some sort of traditional database (MSSQL/PostgreSQL/MySQL) or document based DB (CouchDB, SimpleDB, et cetera).  Use LDAP for authorization, then hit the DB for more advanced stuff.</li>
<li>Use a traditional database (Relational or Document) for everything.</li>
</ul>

<p>Are any of these three the best? Are there other solutions which fit the objectives above and are easier to implement?</p>

<p>** I should add that almost all applications that will be authenticating against the user database will be under our control.  The lone few outsiders will be the applications we're removing the current user database from and perhaps 1 or 2 others.  Nothing so broad as to need an openID server.</p>

<p>Its also important to know that a lot of these users have had these accounts for  5-8 years and know their logins and passwords, et cetera.</p>

<p>I understand where to implement the actual cascaded updates (inside

my python projects, but I have run into one show-stopper:  One of the
error types that I find extremely useful--:<code>E1101: *%s %r has no %r
member*</code>--constantly reports errors when using common django fields,
for example:</p>

<pre><code>E1101:125:get_user_tags: Class 'Tag' has no 'objects' member
</code></pre>

<p>which is caused by this code:</p>

<pre><code>def get_user_tags(username):
   """"""
   Gets all the tags that username has used.

   Returns a query set.
   """"""
   return Tag.objects.filter(  ## This line triggers the error.
       tagownership__users__username__exact=username).distinct()

# Here is the Tag class, models.Model is provided by Django:
class Tag(models.Model):
   """"""
   Model for user-defined strings that help categorize Events on
   on a per-user basis.
   """"""
   name = models.CharField(max_length=500, null=False, unique=True)

   def __unicode__(self):
       return self.name
</code></pre>

<p>How can I tune Pylint to properly take fields such as objects into account?  (I've also looked into the Django source, and I have been unable to find the implementation of <code>objects</code>, so I suspect it is not ""just"" a class field.  On the other hand, I'm fairly new to python, so I may very well have overlooked something.)</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> The only way I've found to tell pylint to not warn about these warnings is by blocking all errors of the type (E1101) which is not an acceptable solution, since that is (in my opinion) an extremely useful error.  If there is another way, without augmenting the pylint source, please point me to specifics :)</p>

<p>See <a href=""http://creswick.github.io/blog/2008/09/05/wrestling-python/"">here</a> for a summary of the problems I've had with <code>pychecker</code> and <code>pyflakes</code> -- they've proven to be far to unstable for general use.  (In pychecker's case, the crashes originated in the pychecker code -- not source it was loading/invoking.)</p>
