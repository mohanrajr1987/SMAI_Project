<ul>
<li>I have an anchor tag in an ASP.NET Repeater control.  </li>
<li>The OnClick event of the anchor contains a call to a Javascript function.  </li>
<li>The Javascript function takes a string for its input parameter.  </li>
<li>The string parameter is populated with a databound value from the Repeater.</li>

<p>I need the 'double quotes' for the Container.DataItem.<br>
I need the 'single quotes' for the OnClick.</p>

<p>And I still need <em>one more delimiter</em> (triple quotes?) for the input string parameter of the Javascript function call.</p>

<p>Since I can't use 'single quotes' again, how do I ensure the Javascript function knows the input parameter is a string and not an integer?</p>

<p>Without the extra quotes around the input string parameter, the Javascript function thinks I'm passing in an integer.</p>

  function ToggleDisplay(jobCode)

It should enable the radio buttons if you select the ""Enable both radio buttons"" option.  These both work...</p>

<p>However, if you don't use your mouse to move between the 2 options (""Enable..."" and ""Disable..."") then the radio buttons do not appear to be disabled or enabled correctly, until you click anywhere else on the page (not on the radio buttons themselves).</p>

<p>Now I think it would look much nicer, if the textarea I'm using for the main address details would just take up the area of the text in it, and automatically resize if the text was changed.</p>

<p>Here's a screenshot of it currently.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/XK48E.png"" alt=""ISO Address""></p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<hr>

<p>@Chris</p>

<p>A good point, but there are reasons I want it to resize, I want the area it takes up to be the area of the information contained in it.  As you can see in the screen shot, if I have a fixed textarea, it takes up a fair wack of vertical space.</p>

<p>I can reduce the font, but I need address to be large and readable.  Now I can reduce the size of the text area, but then I have problems with people who have an address line that takes 3 or 4 (one takes 5) lines.  Needing to have the user use a scrollbar is a major no-no.</p>

<p>I guess I should be a bit more specific, I'm after vertical resizing, the width doesn't matter as much.  The only problem that happens with that, is the ISO number (the large ""1"") gets pushed under the address when the window width is too small (as you can see on the screenshot).</p>

<p>It's not about having a gimick, it's about having a text field the user can edit that won't take up unnecessary space, but will show all the text in it.</p>

<p>Though if someone comes up with another way to approach the problem I'm open to that too.</p>

<p>@Orion</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I've modified the code a little because it was acting a little odd, I changed it to activate on keyup, because it wouldn't take into consideration the character that was just typed.</p>

<pre><code>resizeIt = function( ) {
  var str = $( 'iso_address' ).value;
  var cols = $( 'iso_address' ).cols;
  var linecount = 0;
  $A( str.split( ""\n"" ) ).each( function( l ) {
    linecount += 1 + Math.floor( l.length / cols ); // take into account long lines
  } )
  $( 'iso_address' ).rows = linecount;
};

I don't know if its a bug in Firefox 3 or a page running too much client side JavaScript, but I would like to try and debug it a bit.</p>

<p>So, my question is, is there a way to have some kind of process explorer, or task manager sort of thing for Firefox 3?  I would like to be able to see what tabs are using what percent of my processor via the JavaScript on that page (or anything in the page that is causing CPU/memory usage).  Does anybody know of a plugin that does this, or something similar?  Has anyone else done this kind of inspection another way?</p>

<p>I know about FireBug, but I can't imagine how I would use it to finger which tab is using a lot of resources.</p>

<p>Any suggestions or insights?</p>

<p>UPDATE: Thanks Orion for the info!  It doesn't really answer the question of having such a process explorer, but I think it answers my problem, so I'll mark yours as the answer!

<p>I have two drop-down controls, on the first-drop down I have a javascript <code>onChange</code> event. The javascript enables the second drop-down and removes a value from it (the value selected in the first drop-down). If they click the blank first value of the drop-down, then the second drop-down will be disabled (and the options reset).</p>

<p>I also have code in the <code>OnPreRender</code> method that will enable or disable the second drop-down based on the value of the first drop-down. This is so that the value of the first drop-down can be selected in code (loading user settings).</p>

<p>My problem is:</p>

<ol>
<li>The user selects something in the first drop-down. The second drop-down will become enabled through javascript. </li>
<li>They then change a third drop-down that initiates a post back. After the post back the drop-downs are in the correct state (first value selected, second drop-down enabled).</li>
<li>If they then click the back button, the second drop-down will no longer be enabled although it should be since there's something selected in the first drop-down.</li>

<p>I've tried adding a startup script (that will set the correct state of the second-drop down) through <code>ClientScript.RegisterStartupScript</code>, however when this gets called the first drop-down has a <code>selectedIndex</code> of <code>0</code>, not what it actually is. My guess is that the value of the selection gets set after my start script (but still doesn't call the <code>onChange</code> script).</p>

<p>My question is: what server-side frameworks/languages build a page by treating it as a DOM tree from the beginning - inserting nodes instead of echoing strings? I think it would be very helpful if the client-side and server-side code both saw the page the same way. You could certainly hack something like this together in any web server language, but a framework dedicated to creating a page this way could make some very nice optimizations.</p>
