<p>I'd prefer to use <code>wrapInner()</code> because I can then add a CSS class to the <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> tag to handle all formatting, but if I use <code>wrap()</code>, I have to put page formatting CSS in the <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> tag and text/font formatting in the <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tag, or Firefox and IE both choke.

It's hit or miss, I know, but the PHP and CSS sections specifically have proven very useful for reference.</p>

<p>Anyway, I was wondering if there was a similar site for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JQuery"" rel=""nofollow"">jQuery</a>. I'm interested in learning, but I need it to be online/searchable, so I can refer back to it easily when I need the information in the future.</p>

<p>Also, as a brief aside, is jQuery worth learning? Or should I look at different JavaScript libraries? I know Jeff uses jQuery on Stack Overflow and it seems to be working well.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: jQuery's website has a <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials"" rel=""nofollow"">pretty big list of tutorials</a>, and a seemingly comprehensive <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page"" rel=""nofollow"">documentation page</a>. I haven't had time to go through it all yet, has anyone else had experience with it?</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2</strong>: It seems Google is now hosting the jQuery libraries. That should give jQuery a pretty big advantage in terms of publicity. </p>

<p>Also, if everyone uses a single unified aQuery library hosted at the same place, it should get cached for most Internet users early on and therefore not impact the download footprint of your site should you decide to use it.</p>

<h2>2 Months Later...</h2>

<p><strong>Edit 3</strong>: I started using jQuery on a project at work recently and it is great to work with! Just wanted to let everyone know that I have concluded it is <strong><em>ABSOLUTELY</em></strong> worth it to learn and use jQuery.</p>

<p>Also, I learned almost entirely from the Official jQuery <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page"" rel=""nofollow"">documentation</a> and <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials"" rel=""nofollow"">tutorials</a>. It's very straightforward.</p>

<h2>10 Months Later...</h2>

<p>jQuery is a part of just about every web app I've made since I initially wrote this post. It makes progressive enhancement a breeze, and helps make the code maintainable.</p>

<p>Also, all the jQuery plug-ins are an invaluable resource!</p>

<h2>3 Years Later...</h2>

<p>Still using jQuery just about every day. I now author jQuery plug-ins and consult full time. I'm primarily a Djangonaut but I've done several javascript only contracts with jQuery. It's a life saver.</p>

<p>From one jQuery user to another... You should look at <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/category/plugins/templates/"" rel=""nofollow"">templating with jQuery</a> (or underscore -- see below).</p>

This is an example of what a call might look like:</p>

<pre><code>$.ajax({
    url: ""userCreation.ashx"",
    data: { u:userName, p:password, e:email },
    type: ""POST"",
    beforeSend: function(){disableSubmitButton();},
    complete: function(){enableSubmitButton();},
    error: function(xhr, statusText, errorThrown){
            // Work out what the error was and display the appropriate message

    success: function(data){
            displayUserCreatedMessage();
            refreshUserList();
        }
});
</code></pre>

<p>The request might fail for a number of reasons, such as duplicate user name, duplicate email address etc, and the ashx is written to throw an exception when this happens.</p>

<p>My problem seems to be that by throwing an exception the ashx causes the statusText and errorThrown to be undefined. I can get to the XMLHttpRequest.responseText which contains the HTML that makes up the standard .net error page.</p>

<p>I am finding the page title in the responseText and using the title to work out which error was thrown. Although I have a suspicion that this will fall apart when I enable custom error handling pages.</p>

<p>Should I be throwing the errors in the ashx, or should I be returning a status code as part of the data returned by the call to userCreation.ashx, then using this to decide what action to take? How do you handle these situations?</p>

<p>Everything seems to work fine (content coming from the database is displayed properly, and I am able to submit forms which are stored in UTF-8 in the database).

<p>If I execute <em>Copy Location with parameters</em> in Firebug, the encoding seems already wrong:</p>

        function(data){
        /* Do stuff with the answer */
    }, ""json"");  }

<p>At the moment, <strong>website A</strong> opens a modal window containing <strong>website B</strong> using a <a href=""http://jquery.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">jQuery</a> plug-in called <a href=""http://dev.iceburg.net/jquery/jqModal/"" rel=""nofollow"">jqModal</a>. <strong>Website B</strong> does some work and returns some results to <strong>website A</strong>. To return that information we have to work around cross-site scripting restrictions - <strong>website B</strong> creates an iframe that refers to a page on <strong>website A</strong> and includes *fragment identifiers"" containing the information to be returned. The iframe is polled by <strong>website A</strong> to detect the returned information. It's a <a href=""http://tagneto.blogspot.com/2006/06/cross-domain-frame-communication-with.html"" rel=""nofollow"">common technique</a> but it's hacky.</p>

<p>To initialize the datepicker, according to the <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Datepicker"" rel=""nofollow"">jQuery UI documentation</a> I only have to do <code>$('#example').datepicker();</code> and it does work, but only on the first datepicker that is created.</p>

<p>The code to duplicate the div is the following:</p>

<pre><code>$(""a#dupMe"").click(function(event){
    event.preventDefault();
    i++;
    var a = $(""#template"").clone(true).insertBefore(""#template"").hide().fadeIn(1000);
    a.find(""input#txt"").attr('value', i);
    a.find(""input#example"").datepicker();
});

<pre><code>$('#template #example').datepicker();
$(""#template #txt"").click(function() { alert($(this).val()); });

<p>So thanks to Matt Hinze's suggestion I realised I could do what I wanted to do with JQuery animate (I require continuous scrolling not discrete scrolling like the example). However, I quickly ran into similar problems to those I was having with liScroll and after all that realised a CSS issue (as always) was responsible.</p>

<p>Solution: liScroll - change the default 'var stripWidth = 0' to something like 100, to give a little space and avoid new line wrapping.</p>

Solve by brostbeef!<br>
Since I was originally using flora, I had mistakenly assumed that I have to specify a class attribute. Turns out, this is only true when you actually use the flora theme (as in the samples). If you use the customized theme, specifying a class attribute causes that strange behaviour.</p>

<p>EDIT: The following code was helpful with chaining. However, (in Internet&nbsp;Explorer) <code>.val('whatever')</code> did not select the option that was added. (I did use the same 'value' in both <code>.append</code> and <code>.val</code>.)</p>

<pre><code>$('#mySelect').find('option').remove().end().append('&lt;option value=""whatever""&gt;text&lt;/option&gt;').val('whatever');

On another part of this page there are a set of links which, when clicked, the entire page reloads and looks exactly the same as before except for the chart in the middle of the page.</p>

<p>What I want to do is when a link is clicked on a page just the chart on the page is changed.  This will speed things up tremendously as the page is roughly 100kb large, and don't really want to reload the entire page just to display this.  </p>

<p>I've been doing this via JavaScript, which works so far, using the following code</p>

<pre><code>document.getElementById('chart').src = '/charts/10.png';
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that when the user clicks on the link, it may take a couple of seconds before the chart changes.  This makes the user think that their click hasn't done anything, or that the system is slow to respond.</p>

<p>What I want to happen is display a spinner / throbber / status indicator, in place of where the image is while it is loading, so when the user clicks the link they know at least the system has taken their input and is doing something about it.  </p>

<p>I've tried a few suggestions, even using a psudo time out to show a spinner, and then flick back to the image.  </p>

<p>A good suggestion I've had is to use the following</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img src=""/charts/10.png"" lowsrc=""/spinner.gif""/&gt;
