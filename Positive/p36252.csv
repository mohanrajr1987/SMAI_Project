"2872","1","2901","","2008-08-05 21:19:37","","10","860","<p><strong>My Goal</strong></p>

<p>I would like to have a main processing thread (non GUI), and be able to spin off GUIs in their own background threads as needed, and having my main non GUI thread keep working. Put another way, I want my main non GUI-thread to be the owner of the GUI-thread and not vice versa. I'm not sure this is even possible with Windows Forms(?)</p>

<p>(Sorry for the big post here. I've had complaints about previous shorter versions of this question just isn't comprehensible. I'm a lousy writer)</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>I have a component based system in which a controller dynamically load assemblies and instantiates and run classes implementing a common <em>IComponent</em> interface with a single method <em>DoStuff()</em> .</p>

<p>Which components that gets loaded is configured via a xml configuration file and by adding new assemblies containing different implementations of <em>IComponent</em> . The components provides utility functions to the main application. While the main program is doing it's thing, e.g. controlling a nuclear plant, the components might be performing utility tasks (in their own threads), e.g. cleaning the database, sending emails, printing funny jokes on the printer, what have you. What I would like, is to have one of these components be able to display a GUI, e.g. with status information for the said email sending component.</p>

<p>The lifetime of the complete system looks like this</p>

<ol>
<li>Application starts.</li>
<li>Check configuration file for components to load. Load them.</li>
<li><strong>For each component, run DoStuff() to initialize it and make it live its own life in their own threads.</strong></li>
<li>Continue to do main application-thingy king of work, forever.</li>
</ol>

<p>I have not yet been able to successfully perform point 3 if the component fires up a GUI in <em>DoStuff()</em> . It simply just halts until the GUI is closed. And not until the GUI is closed does the program progress to point 4.</p>

<p>It would be great if these components were allowed to start up their own Windows Forms GUIs.</p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>

<p>When a component tries to fire up a GUI in <em>DoStuff()</em> (the exact line of code is when the component runs Application.Run(theForm)) , the component and hence our system ""hangs"" at the Application.Run() line until the GUI is closed. Well, the just fired up GUI works fine, as expected.</p>

<p>Example of components. One hasn't nothing to do with GUI, whilst the second fires up a cute windows with pink fluffy bunnies in them.</p>

<pre><code>public class MyComponent1: IComponent<br>{<br>    public string DoStuff(...) { // write something to the database  }<br>}<br><br>public class MyComponent2: IComponent<br>    public void DoStuff()<br>    {<br>        Application.EnableVisualStyles();<br>        Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false);<br>        Application.Run(new Form());<br><br>        // I want the thread to immediately return after the GUI <br>        // is fired up, so that my main thread can continue to work.<br>    }<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>I have tried this with no luck. Even when I try to fire up the GUI in it's own thread, the execution halts until the GUI as closed.</p>

<pre><code>    public void DoStuff()<br>    {<br>           new Thread(ThreadedInitialize).Start()<br>    }<br><br>    private void ThreadedInitialize()<br>    {<br>        Application.EnableVisualStyles();<br>        Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false);<br>        Application.Run(new Form());<br>    }<br></code></pre>

<p>I need to interact with controls on other forms. I am trying to access the controls by using, for example, the following...</p>

<pre><code>otherForm.Controls[""nameOfControl""].Visible = false;
</code></pre>

<p>It doesn't work the way I would expect. I end up with an exception thrown from <code>Main</code>. However, if I make the controls <code>public</code> instead of <code>private</code>, I can then access them directly, as so...</p>

<p>But is that the best way to do it? Is making the controls <code>public</code> on the other form considered ""best practice""? Is there a ""better"" way to access controls on another form?</p>

<p><strong>Further Explanation:</strong></p>

<p>This is actually a sort of follow-up to another question I asked, <em><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3725/best-method-for-creating-a-tree-view-preferences-dialog-type-of-interface-in-c"">Best method for creating a “tree-view preferences dialog” type of interface in C#?</a></em>. The answer I got was great and solved many, many organizational problems I was having in terms of keeping the UI straight and easy to work with both in run-time and design-time. However, it did bring up this one niggling issue of easily controlling other aspects of the interface.</p>

<p>Basically, I have a root form that instantiates a lot of other forms that sit in a panel on the root form. So, for instance, a radio button on one of those sub-forms might need to alter the state of a status strip icon on the main, root form. In that case, I need the sub-form to talk to the control in the status strip of the parent (root) form. (I hope that makes sense, not in a ""who's on first"" kind of way.)</p>

Our codebase contains ALOT of legacy/archaic code which must be kept operational. Some of this code is older than me (originally written in the late 70s) and some members of our team are still on Visual Studio 6.</p>

<p>However, a conclusion has thankfully been reached internally that our product is looking somewhat antiquated compared to our competitors', and that something needs to be done.</p>

<p>I am currently working on a new area of the UI which is quite separate from the rest of the product. I have therefore been given the chance to try out 'new' technology stacks as a sort of proving ground before the long process of moving over the rest of the UI begins.</p>

<p>I have been using C# with Windows Forms and the .net framework for a while in my spare time and enjoy it, but am somewhat worried about the headaches caused by interop. While this particular branch of the UI won't require much interop with the legacy C++ codebase, I can forsee this becoming an issue in the future.</p>

<p>The alternative is just to continue with MFC, but try and take advantage of the new feature pack that shipped with VS2008. This I guess is the easiest option, but I worry about longevity and not taking advantage of the goodness that is .net...</p>

<p>So, which do I pick? We're a small team so my recommendation will quite probably be accepted as a future direction for our development - I want to get it right.</p>

Ideally the content would shrink just a bit to make room for the vertical scrollbar.</p>

<p>My current solution has been to just keep my controls out of the far right 40 pixels or so that the vertical scroll-bar will be taking up.  Since this is still effectively client space for the control, the horizontal scroll-bar still comes up when it gets covered by the vertical scroll-bar, even though no controls are being hidden at all.  But then at least the user doesn't actually need to <strong>use</strong> the horizontal scrollbar that comes up.</p>

<p>Is there a better way to make this all work?  Some way to keep the unneeded and unwanted scrollbars from showing up at all?</p>

controls with additional properties. For one of these properties, I have 
written a UITypeEditor. So far, all works just fine.</p>

<p>The extender also has a couple of properties itself, which I am trying to 
use as a sort of default for the UITypeEditor. What I want to do is to be 
able to set a property on the extender itself (not the extended controls), 
and when I open up the UITypeEditor for one of the additional properties on 
an extended control, I want to set a value in the UITypeEditor to the value 
of the property on the extender.</p>

<p>A simple example: The ExtenderProvider has a property DefaultExtendedValue. On the form I set the value of this property to ""My Value"". Extended controls have, through the provider, a property ExtendedValue with a UITypeEditor. When I open the editor for the property ExtendedValue the default (initial) value should be set to ""My Value"".</p>

<p>It seems to me that the best place to do this would be 
UITypeEditor.EditValue, just before calling 
IWindowsFormsEditorService.DropDownControl or .ShowDialog.</p>

<p>The only problem is that I can't (or I haven't discovered how to) get hold 
of the extender provider itself in EditValue, to read the value of the property in question and set it in the UITypeEditor. Context gives me the extended 
control, but that is of no use to me in this case.</p>

<p>Is there any way to achieve what I'm trying? Any help appreciated!</p>

<p>Thanks 
Tom</p>

<hr>

<p>@samjudson: That's not a bad idea, but unfortunately it doesn't quite get me there. I'd really like to be able to set this default value individually for each instance of the extender provider. (I might have more than one on a single form with different values for different groups of extended controls.)</p>

That is, one single top down list of downloads which are custom controls containing progress bars, buttons and what not.</p>

<p>The requirements are that there should be one single list, with one element on each row. Each element must be a custom control. The whole list should be dynamically re-sizable, so that when you make it longer / shorter the list adds a scroll bar when needed and when you make it thinner / wider the custom controls should resize to the width of the list.</p>

<p>We've tried using a <code>FlowLayoutPanel</code> but haven't gotten resizing to work the way we want to. Preferably we should only have to set anchoring of the custom controls to Left &amp; Right. We've also thought about using a <code>TableLayoutPanel</code> but found adding rows dynamically to be a too big overhead so far.</p>

<p>This must be quite a common use case, and it seems a bit weird to me that the <code>FlowLayoutPanel</code> has no intuitive way of doing this. <em>Has anyone done something similar or have tips or tricks to get us under way?</em></p>

<p>An example of the sort of relationship is that I have a table of OrderLines. Orderlines have a foreign key relationship to Products and Products in turn have a foreign key relationship to ProductTypes.  </p>

<p>I'd like to have a databound DataGridView where each row represents an orderline, displaying the line's product and producttype.</p>

<p>Users can add or edit orderlines direct to the grid and choose the product for the order line from a comboBoxColumn - this should then update the producttype column, showing the producttype for the selected product, in the same row.</p>

<p>The closest to a good fit that I've found so far is to introduce a domain object representing an orderline then bind the DataGridView to a collection of these orderlines. I then add properties to the orderline object that expose the product and the producttype, and raise relevant notifypropertychanged events to keep everything up to date. In my orderline repository I can then wire up the mappings between this orderline object and the three tables in my database.</p>

<p>This works for the databinding side of things, but having to hand code all that OR-mapping in the repository seems bad. I thought nHibernate would be able to help with this wiring up but am struggling with the mappings through all the foreign keys - they seem to work ok (the foreignkey lookup for an orderline's product creates the correct product object based on the foreign key) until I try to do the databinding, I can't get the databound id columns to update my product or producttype objects.</p>

<p>Is my general approach even in the right ballpark? If it is, what is a good solution to the mapping problem?</p>

<p>Or, is there a better solution to databinding rows including foreign key lookups that I haven't even considered?</p>

<p>As such… some clients want a WYSIWYG editor for HTML. I'd like to convince them that they'd benefit from using simpler language (namely, Markdown). Ideally, what I'd like to have is a WYSIWYG editor for that. They don't need tables, or anything sophisticated like that.</p>

<p>A cursory search reveals <a href=""http://aspnetresources.com/blog/markdown_announced.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">a .NET Markdown to HTML converter</a>, and then we have <a href=""http://www.codeproject.com/KB/edit/editor_in_windows_forms.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">a Windows Forms-based text editor that outputs HTML</a>, but apparently nothing that brings the two together. As a result, we'd still have our varchars with markup in there, but at least it would be both quite human-readable and still easily parseable.</p>

<p>Would this — a WYSIWYG editor that outputs Markdown, which is then later on parsed into HTML in ASP.NET — be feasible? Any alternative suggestions?</p>

<p>I want to use a button like this with a built-in list in one of my applications, but I can't find the control they're using anywhere in visual studio.  I should clarify that I'm looking for that specific button, not the entire dialog.  Any thoughts?</p>

<p>I assume this could be done with reflection, but I'm not really sure how best to go about it, not having worked with reflection before.</p>

<p>Right now, I'm using a sort of clunky workaround, in which I override a function GetComponents and return an array of the components I'm interested in. This is obviously prone to errors, since it's easy to forget to implement the overridden function or update it when components are added.</p>

<p>If anyone has any tips or can suggest a better way, I'd be glad to hear.</p>
