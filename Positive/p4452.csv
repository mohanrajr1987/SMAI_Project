<p>Suppose I have a vector that is nested in a dataframe one or two levels.  Is there a quick and dirty way to access the last value, without using the <code>length()</code> function?  Something ala PERL's $# special var?</p>

<p>So I would like something like:</p>

<pre><code>dat$vec1$vec2[$#]

<p>I programmed the inner function to store each dataset before moving to the next, so all the work of the outer function occurs as side effects on global variables... a big no-no.

<p>I have an intuitive notion of how quantiles work, and an M.S. in stats, but boy oh boy, the documentation for it is confusing to me.  </p>

<p>From the docs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q[i](p) = (1 - gamma) x[j] + gamma
  x[j+1],</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm with it so far.  For a type <em>i</em> quantile, it's an interpolation between x[j] and x [j+1], based on some mysterious constant <em>gamma</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>where 1 &lt;= i &lt;= 9, (j-m)/n &lt;= p &lt;
  (j-m+1)/ n, x[j] is the jth order
  statistic, n is the sample size, and m
  is a constant determined by the sample
  quantile type. Here gamma depends on
  the fractional part of g = np+m-j. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, how calculate j?   m?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the continuous sample quantile
  types (4 through 9), the sample
  quantiles can be obtained by linear
  interpolation between the kth order
  statistic and p(k): </p>
  
  <p>p(k) = (k - alpha) / (n - alpha - beta
  + 1),
  where α and β are constants determined
  by the type. Further, m = alpha + p(1
  - alpha - beta), and gamma = g.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now I'm really lost.  p, which was a constant before, is now apparently a function.  </p>

<p>So for Type 7 quantiles, the default...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Type 7</p>
  
  <p>p(k) = (k - 1) / (n - 1). In this case, p(k) = mode[F(x[k])]. This is used by S. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyone want to help me out?  In particular I'm confused by the notation of p being a function and a constant, what the heck <em>m</em> is, and now to calculate j for some particular <em>p</em>.  </p>

<p>I hope that based on the answers here, we can submit some revised documentation that better explains what is going on here.  </p>

<p>I have a data frame (which for sentimental reasons I like to call my.data) which I want to do a full marginal analysis on. I need to remove certain elements one at a time and 'value' the data frame then I need to do the iterating again by removing only the next element. Then do again... and again... The idea is to do a full marginal analysis on a subset of my data. Anyhow, I can't conceive of how to do this in a vector efficient way. </p>

<p>I've shortened the looping part of the code down and it looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>for (j in my.data$item[my.data$fixed==0]) { # &lt;-- selects the items I want to loop 
                                            #     through
    my.data.it &lt;- my.data[my.data$item!= j,] # &lt;-- this kicks item j out of the list
    sum.data &lt;-aggregate(my.data.it, by=list(year), FUN=sum, na.rm=TRUE) #&lt;-- do an
                                                                         # aggregation

    do(a.little.dance) &amp;&amp; make(a.little.love) -&gt; get.down(tonight) # &lt;-- a little
                                                                   #  song and dance

    delta &lt;- (get.love)                                         # &lt;-- get some love

"551113","1","","","2009-02-15 16:05:33","","4","890","<p>I think this is a completely unique question on Stack Overflow.  First some background:</p>

<p>I've been asked to write a new GUI on top of a calculation engine called BRCAPRO (brack-a-pro).  BRCAPRO implements a Mendelian computational model based on a piece of software called BayesMendel.  BRCAPRO calculation are used by doctors and surgeons specializing in cancer treatment to show patients:</p>

<ul>
<li>The probability of being diagnosed with cancer based on their genetics and family history.</li>
<li>The change in life expectancy based on different forms of treatment and/or the age at which these treatments are started.</li>
</ul>

<p>I've done enough research to know that the BRCAPRO formulas are far too complicated to reasonably implement in my own code.</p>

<p>There is an existing well-known (to cancer doctors) software package called CancerGene: <a href=""http://www8.utsouthwestern.edu/utsw/cda/dept47829/files/65844.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www8.utsouthwestern.edu/utsw/cda/dept47829/files/65844.html</a>.  This program is very old, runs on Windows 95 and includes calculating engines for several forms of cancer my client does not work with.  Ideally my client would like his application to run on the web so that he can share information with other doctors easily.</p>

<p>My task is take the CancerGene application, which is built on the BRCAPRO engine, and:</p>

<ol>
<li>Duplicate 90% of its functionality</li>
<li>Remove unnecessary functionality</li>
<li>Modify the output of reports</li>
<li>If possible, make it web-based</li>
</ol>

<p>Now my question:</p>

<p>Does anybody have any idea how to code against BRCAPRO?  I have Googled for two days and found no API documentation or development information of any kind.  Wikipedia says that the BayesMendel modeling software is written in R, but I don't have any idea what BRCAPRO is written in.  I know absolutely nothing about R.  </p>

<p>To be clear, I don't need to modify the behavior or calculating engine of BRCAPRO.  I just need to know how to feed it input so that it returns numbers to me.</p>

<p>--  Edit to add more information --</p>

<p>I downloaded the CancerGene application in the above link and installed it.  There was a small amount of documentation, including the data format that BRCAPRO expects to receive.  Without getting into an unnecessary level of detail, BRCAPRO expects matrix-formatted data where each column represents a genetic trait and each row represents a family member.  Now I just need to know how to pass this matrix to the BRCAPRO engine once I collect it from my Web/Windows form.</p>

<p>Here's hoping there are a couple of doctor/developers here on Stack Overflow!</p>

I need a database engine for my analytical work. The DB needs to be fast and does NOT need all the logging and other overhead found in typical databases (SQL Server, Oracle, DB2, etc.) </p>

<p>Yesterday I listened to <a href=""http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail4009.html"">Michael Stonebraker speak at the Money:Tech conference</a> and I kept thinking, ""I'm not really crazy. There IS a better way!"" He talks about using <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column-oriented%5FDBMS"">column stores</a> instead of row oriented databases. I went to the Wikipedia page for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column-oriented%5FDBMS"">column stores</a> and I see a few open source projects (which I like) and a few commercial/open source projects (which I don't fully understand). </p>

<p>My question is this: In an applied analytical environment, how do the different column based DB's differ? How should I be thinking about them? Anyone have practical experience with multiple column based systems? Can I leverage my SQL experience with these DBs or am I going to have to learn a new language?</p>

<p>I am ultimately going to be pulling data into R for analysis. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I was requested for some clarification in what exactly I am trying to do. So, here's an example of what I would like to do:
Create a table that has 4 million rows and 20 columns (5 dims, 15 facts). Create 5 aggregation tables that calculate max, min, and average for each of the facts. Join those 5 aggregations back to the starting table. Now calculate the percent deviation from mean, percent deviation of min, and percent deviation from max for each row and add it to the original table. This table data does not get new rows each day, it gets TOTALLY replaced and the process is repeated. Heaven forbid if the process must be stopped. And the logs... ohhhhh the logs! :)</p>

<p>I have the following local function (the details of the ""nodes-in-leafList-match-nodes-in-clusterList"" condition aren't important, but that it highlights significant nodes):</p>

<pre><code>markSignificantClusters &lt;&lt;- function (n) {
  if (!is.leaf(n)) {
     a &lt;- attributes(n)
     leafList &lt;- unlist(dendrapply(n, listLabels))
     for (clusterIndex in 1:length(significantClustersList[[1]])) {
       clusterList &lt;- unlist(significantClustersList[[1]][clusterIndex])
       if (nodes-in-leafList-match-nodes-in-clusterList) {
          # I now have a node ""n"" that contains significant leaves, and
          # I'd like to use a dendrapply() call to another local function
          # which colors the edges that run down to the leaves; or, draw
          # a rect() around the leaves
       }
     }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>From within this <code>if</code> block, I have tried calling <code>dendrapply(n, markEdges)</code>, but this did not work:</p>

<pre><code>markEdges &lt;&lt;- function (n) {
  a &lt;- attributes(n)
  attr(n, ""edgePar"") &lt;- c(a$edgePar, list(lty=3, col=""red""))
}
</code></pre>

<p>In my ideal example, the edges connecting ""<code>_+v\_stat5a\_01_</code>"" and ""<code>_+v\_stat5b\_01_</code>"" would be dashed and of a red color.</p>

<p>I have also tried using <code>rect.hclust()</code> within this <code>if</code> block:</p>

<pre><code>ma &lt;- match(leafList, orderedLabels)  
rect.hclust(scoreClusterObj, h = a$height, x = c(min(ma), max(ma)), border = 2)
</code></pre>

<p>But the result does not work with horizontal dendrograms (<em>i.e.</em> dendrograms with horizontal labels). <a href=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3331/3410126060%5Ff8f06c4498%5Fo.png"" rel=""nofollow"">Here is an example</a> (note the red stripe in the lower-right corner). Something is not correct about the dimensions of what <code>rect.hclust()</code> generates, and I don't know how it works, to be able to write my own version.</p>

<p>I appreciate any advice for getting <code>edgePar</code> or <code>rect.hclust()</code> to work properly, or to be able to write my own <code>rect.hclust()</code> equivalent.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>Since asking this question, I used <code>getAnywhere(rect.hclust())</code> to get the functional code that calculates parameters and draws the <code>rect</code> object. I wrote a custom version of this function to handle horizontal and vertical leaves, and call it with <code>dendrapply()</code>.</p>

<p>However, there is some kind of clipping effect that removes part of the <code>rect</code>. For horizontal leaves (leaves that are drawn on the right side of the tree), the rightmost edge of the <code>rect</code> either disappears or is thinner than the border width of the other three sides of the <code>rect</code>. For vertical leaves (leaves that are drawn on the bottom of the tree), the bottommost edge of the <code>rect</code> suffers the same display problem.</p>

<p>What I had done as a means of marking significant clusters is to reduce the width of the <code>rect</code> such that I render a vertical red stripe between the tips of the cluster edges and the (horizontal) leaf labels. </p>

<p>This eliminates the clipping issue, but introduces another problem, in that the space between the cluster edge tips and the leaf labels is only six or so pixels wide, which I don't have much control over. This limits the width of the vertical stripe. </p>

<p>The worse problem is that the <code>x</code>-coordinate that marks where the vertical stripe can fit between the two elements will change based on the width of the larger tree (<code>par[""usr""]</code>), which in turn depends on how the tree hierarchy ends up being structured.</p>

<p>I wrote a ""correction"" or, better termed, a hack to adjust this <code>x</code> value and the <code>rect</code> width for horizontal trees. It doesn't always work consistently, but for the trees I am making, it seems to keep from getting too close to (or overlapping) edges and labels.</p>

<p>Ultimately, a better fix would be to find out how to draw the <code>rect</code> so that there is no clipping. Or a consistent way to calculate the specific <code>x</code> position in between tree edges and labels for any given tree, so as to center and size the stripe properly.</p>

<p>I would also be very interested in a method for annotating edges with colors or line styles.</p>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env R

<p>but I haven't been able to make either of those work.</p>

<p>Another option is keeping the scripts purely in R, e.g. <code>script.R</code>, and invoking it with <code>R --file=script.R</code> or similar.  However, occasionally a script will rely on obscure command line switches at which point part of the code exists outside the script.  Example: sneaking things into R from bash via a local .Rprofile, the desired switches are then everything <code>--vanilla</code> implies except <code>--no-init-file</code>.</p>

<p>Another option is a bash script to store the R flags and be painlessly executable, which then calls the R script.  The problem is that this means a single program just got split into two files which now have to be keep in sync, transferred to new machines together, etc.</p>

<p>The option I currently despise least is embedding the R in a bash script:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
... # usage message to catch bad input without invoking R
... # any bash pre-processing of input
... # etc
R --random-flags &lt;&lt;RSCRIPT
# R code goes here
RSCRIPT

<p>Edit to respond to comments:</p>

<p>It's technically true that const is a compile-time guarantee, but it would be valid in my mind that the R interpreter would throw stop execution with an error message. For example, look what happens when you try to assign values to a numeric constant:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; 7 = 3
Error in 7 = 3 : invalid (do_set) left-hand side to assignment

<p>So what I really want is a language feature that allows you to assign values once and only once, and there should be some kind of error when you try to assign a new value to a variabled declared as const. I don't care if the error occurs at run-time, especially if there's no compilation phase. This might not technically be const by the Wikipedia definition, but it's very close. It also looks like this is not possible in the R programming language.</p>

formally <a href=""http://www.daniel-lemire.com/fr/documents/publications/lemiremaclachlan%5Fsdm05.pdf"">here (PDF)</a>) which is supposed to take item ratings from different users and, given a user vector containing at least 1 rating and 1 missing value, predict the missing ratings.</p>

<p>I found a <a href=""http://www.serpentine.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/slope%5Fone.py.txt"">Python implementation of the algorithm</a>, but I'm having a hard time porting it to <a href=""http://www.r-project.org/"">R</a> (which I'm more comfortable with).

<p>Thanks in advance, folks.</p>

    # create an output vector with NAs for all the items the user has already rated

    pred.out[!is.na(d)]=NA

    a=which(!is.na(pred.out))
    b=which(is.na(pred.out))

<pre><code>f = function( x ) {

count = 1
numbers = rnorm( n = 100, mean = 0, sd = 1 )

   mean = f( numbers )
   print( count )

<p>I don't like that I have to declare the variable count outside the scope of the function. In C or C++ I could just make a static variable. Can I do a similar thing in the R programming language?</p>
