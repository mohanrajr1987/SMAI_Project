<p>My first approach would be to take the string, parse it backwards, until I encounter a separator and use this as my decimal separator. There is an obvious flaw with that: 10.000 would be interpreted as 10.</p>

<p>Another approach: if the string contains 2 different non-numeric characters, use the last one as the decimal separator and discard the others. If I only have one, check if it occurs more than once and discard it if it does. If it only appears once, check if it has 3 digits after it.

From the UI perspective, the DataContext is a design of the sections of your database that you would like to expose to through LinqToSql and is integral in setting up the ORM features of LinqToSql.</p>

<p>My question is: I am setting up a project that uses a large database where all tables are interconnected in some way through Foreign Keys. My first inclination is to make one huge DataContext class that models the entire database. That way I could in theory (though I don't know if this would be needed in practice) use the Foreign Key connections that are generated through LinqToSql to easily go between related objects in my code, insert related objects, etc.</p>

<p>However, after giving it some thought, I am now thinking that it may make more sense to create multiple DataContext classes, each one relating to a specific namespace or logical interrelated section within my database. My main concern is that instantiating and disposing one huge DataContext class all the time for individual operations that relate to specific areas of the Database would be impose an unnecessary imposition on application resources. Additionally, it is easier to create and manage smaller DataContext files than one big one. The thing that I would lose is that there would be some distant sections of the database that would not be navigable through LinqToSql (even though a chain of relationships connects them in the actual database). Additionally, there would be some table classes that would exist in more than one DataContext.</p>

This is fine for controls that are mostly Literal-based (various menus and widgets), but when I have what I call ""dirty"" controls - ones that write extensive information to the ViewState, put tons of CSS or script on the page, require lots of references etc - these are seemingly impossible to move ""out of page"", especially considering how ASP.NET will react on postback.</p>

<p>This seems to be a common problem, but I will describe my scenario to help explain:</p>

<p>I have a grid-like control which has some JavaScript enhancements - namely, the ability to drag and drop columns and rows. When a column or row is dropped into a new position, an AJAX method is invoked to notify the control server-side and fire a corresponding server-side event (""OnColumnMoved"" or ""OnRowMoved"").</p>

<p>ASP.NET AJAX calls, by default, send the entire page as the request. That way the page goes through a complete lifecycle, viewstate is persisted and the state of the control is restored before the RaiseCallbackEvent method is invoked.</p>

<p>However, since the AJAX call does not update the page, the ViewState reflects the <em>original</em> state of the control, even after the column or row has been moved. So the second time a client-side action occurs, the AJAX request goes to the server and the page &amp; control are built back up again to reflect the <em>first</em> state of the control, not the state after the first column or row was moved.</p>

<p>This problem extends to many implications. For example if we have a client-side/AJAX action to add a new item to the grid, and then a row is dragged, the grid is built server-side with one less item than on the client-side.</p>

<p>And finally &amp; most seriously for my specific example, the actual data source object we are acting upon is stored in the page ViewState. That was a design decision to allow keeping a stateful copy of the manipulated data which can either be committed to DB after many manipulations or discarded if the user backs out. That is very difficult to change.</p>

<p>So, again, I need a way for the page ViewState to be updated on callback after the AJAX method is fired.</p>

<p>Does anything like this already exist for ASP.NET, or will I be rolling my own here?</p>

<p>My impression is that the CPU in a Webserver does not need to be THAT fast because requests are usually rather lightweight, so having more (slower) cores should be a better choice as we got many small requests.</p>

<p>Lets say I have a standard business object ""Contact"" in the <em>Business</em> namespace. I write a Web Service to retrieve a Contact's info from a database, and return it. I then write a client application to request said details.</p>

<p>Now, I also then create a utility method that takes a ""Contact"" and does some magic with it, like <code>Utils.BuyContactNewHat()</code> say. Which of course takes the Contact of type <code>Business.Contact</code>.</p>

<p>I then go back to my client application and want to utilise the <code>BuyContactNewHat</code> method, so I add a reference to my <em>Utils</em> namespace and there it is. However, a problem arises with:</p>

<pre><code>Contact c = MyWebService.GetContact(""Rob);
Utils.BuyContactNewHat(c); // &lt;&lt; Error Here
</code></pre>

<p>Since the return type of <code>GetContact</code> is of <code>MyWebService.Contact</code> and not <code>Business.Contact</code> as expected. I understand why this is, because when accessing a web service, you are actually programming against the proxy class generated by the WSDL.</p>

<p>So, is there an ""easier"" way to deal with this type mismatch? I was considering perhaps trying to create a generic converter class that uses reflection to ensure two objects have the same structure, than simply transferring the values across from one to the other.</p>

<p>I have two drop-down controls, on the first-drop down I have a javascript <code>onChange</code> event. The javascript enables the second drop-down and removes a value from it (the value selected in the first drop-down). If they click the blank first value of the drop-down, then the second drop-down will be disabled (and the options reset).</p>

<p>I also have code in the <code>OnPreRender</code> method that will enable or disable the second drop-down based on the value of the first drop-down. This is so that the value of the first drop-down can be selected in code (loading user settings).</p>

<p>My problem is:</p>

<ol>
<li>The user selects something in the first drop-down. The second drop-down will become enabled through javascript. </li>
<li>They then change a third drop-down that initiates a post back. After the post back the drop-downs are in the correct state (first value selected, second drop-down enabled).</li>
<li>If they then click the back button, the second drop-down will no longer be enabled although it should be since there's something selected in the first drop-down.</li>
</ol>

<p>I've tried adding a startup script (that will set the correct state of the second-drop down) through <code>ClientScript.RegisterStartupScript</code>, however when this gets called the first drop-down has a <code>selectedIndex</code> of <code>0</code>, not what it actually is. My guess is that the value of the selection gets set after my start script (but still doesn't call the <code>onChange</code> script).</p>

<p>Any ideas on what to try?</p>

<p>The way I figure, there's 2 ways I can think of:</p>

<p>1.""Use the <strong>Source</strong>, Luke""<br />
In the code where I'm calling DataGrid.DataBind(), use the DataTable.Compute() method (<em>or in my case DataSet.DataTable(0).Compute()</em>). For example:  </p>

<pre><code>Dim strAverage = DataTable.Compute(""Avg(ColumnName)"", """")
</code></pre>

<p>But once I have this, how can I insert it into the footer?</p>

<p>2.""<strong>Bound</strong> for Glory""<br />
Using the DataGrid.ItemDataBound event, and calculating a running total from every ListItemType.Item and ListItemType.AlternatingItem, finally displaying in ListItemType.Footer. For example:  </p>

<pre><code>Select Case e.Item.ItemType
    Case ListItemType.Item, ListItemType.AlternatingItem
        runningTotal += CInt(e.Item.Cells(2).Text)
    Case ListItemType.Footer
        e.Item.Cells(2).Text = runningTotal/DataGrid.Items.Count
End Select
</code></pre>

<p>This just feels wrong, plus I would have to make sure the runningTotal is reset on every DataBind.  </p>

<p>Is there a better way?</p>

<p>Rather than subject users to the hangs, we've rolled back to the previous release while we determine a solution.  The first step is to reproduce the problem -- but we can't. </p>

<p>Here's some background:</p>

<p>Prod has a single virtualized (vmware) web server with two CPUs and 2 GB of RAM.  The database server has 4GB, and 2 CPUs as well.  It's also on VMWare, but separate physical hardware.</p>

<p>During normal usage the application runs fine.  The w3wp.exe process normally uses betwen 5-20% CPU and around 200MB of RAM.  CPU and RAM fluctuate slightly under normal use, but nothing unusual.</p>

<p>However, when we start running into problems, the RAM climbs dramatically and the CPU pegs at 98% (or as much as it can get).  The site becomes unresponsive, necessitating a IIS restart.  Resetting the app pool does nothing in this situation, a full IIS restart is required.</p>

<p>It does not happen during the night (no usage).  It happens more when the site is under load, but it has also happened under non-peak periods.</p>

<p>First step to solving this problem is reproducing it. To simulate the load, we starting using JMeter to simulate usage. Our load script is based on actual usage around the time of the crash.  Using JMeter, we can ramp the usage up quite high (2-3 times the load during the crash) but the site behaves fine.  CPU is up high, and the site does become sluggish, but memory usage is reasonable and nothing is hanging.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any tips on how to reproduce a problem like this in a non-production environment?  We'd really like to reproduce the error, determine a solution, then test again to make sure we've resolved it.  During the process we've found a number of small things that we've improved that might solve the problem, but I'd really feel a lot more confident if we could reproduce the problem and test the improved version.</p>

<p>Any tools, techniques or theories much appreciated!</p>
