<p>It appears that the pointer you get back from new[] is not always the same as the address you pass in (5.3.4, note 12 in the standard seems to confirm that this is correct), but I don't see how you can allocate a buffer for the array to go in if this is the case.</p>

<p>The following example shows the problem. Compiled with Visual Studio, this example results in memory corruption:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;new&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

class A
{
    public:

    A() : data(0) {}
    virtual ~A() {}
    int data;
};

int main()
{
    const int NUMELEMENTS=20;

    char *pBuffer = new char[NUMELEMENTS*sizeof(A)];
    A *pA = new(pBuffer) A[NUMELEMENTS];

    // With VC++, pA will be four bytes higher than pBuffer
    printf(""Buffer address: %x, Array address: %x\n"", pBuffer, pA);

    // Debug runtime will assert here due to heap corruption
    delete[] pBuffer;

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Looking at the memory, the compiler seems to be using the first four bytes of the buffer to store a count of the number of items in it. This means that because the buffer is only <code>sizeof(A)*NUMELEMENTS</code> big, the last element in the array is written into unallocated heap.</p>

<p>So the question is can you find out how much additional overhead your implementation wants in order to use placement new[] safely? Ideally, I need a technique that's portable between different compilers. Note that, at least in VC's case, the overhead seems to differ for different classes. For instance, if I remove the virtual destructor in the example, the address returned from new[] is the same as the address I pass in.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
@Michael, Nice code..</p>

<p>I see how this example works, by just creating specific ""views"" of the original array.</p>

<p>Just a few FYI questions for others who may read this later.</p>

<p>How would you see this working when passing the resultant view to other classes for use? How does the reference to the original array stay in scope?</p>

<p>I guess since you would actually be passing references to the ""views"", the other classes will continue to access the view in the same manner as the example in your Main. The View contains a private reference to the original array keeping in in scope and would not be GC'ed.</p>

<p>I think this is the answer.</p>

<li>@jeff - What doesnt make sense?  I am using this great service for (what I think is) a legit reason.  I want to get better at my hobby, which is all it is, as I am in high school.  Many of my posts regard implementing a genetic algorithm (This post, sparsearray, rank an array, pointer manipulation).</li>
<li>I am using a sparse array representation, as it is possible to exceed the number of molecules in the universe using a traditional (dense) array.  For now, the implementation of the sparsearray itself doesnt matter a whole lot, as I am working to make it work with a standard array before going to a sparse representation.  For those who havent seen my previous questions, I am using a binary search tree as the structure to contain the sparse array points, and a ""driver"" function to traverse the tree as necessary, returning whatever the function is designed to do.  This is flexible, so I can accomodate a lot of different methods of accessing the array. </li>
<li>The structure is a hypercube, and the number of dimensions is specified at run time, as well as the length of each dimension (which are all the same, as it is a hypercube).</li>

<p>I can't determine how to cast to a reference or pointer to array either, albeit that it probably won't help me here.</p>

Is it guaranteed for the compiler to treat array[4][4] the same as array[16]? For instance, would either of the below calls to <code>api_func()</code> be safe?</p>

<pre><code>void api_func(const double matrix[4][4]);

// ...

{
  typedef double Matrix[4][4];

  double* array1 = new double[16];
  double array2[16];

  // ...

  api_func(reinterpret_cast&lt;Matrix&amp;&gt;(array1));
  api_func(reinterpret_cast&lt;Matrix&amp;&gt;(array2));
}

Example: I have [""Alpha"", ""Beta"", ""Gamma""] and want to join the strings into one, separated by commas – ""Alpha, Beta, Gamma"".</p>

<p>Now I know that most programming languages offer some kind of join method for this. I just wonder how these might be implemented.
When I took introductory courses, I often tried to go it alone, but never found a satisfactory algorithm. Everything seemed rather messy, the problem being that you can not just loop through the array, concatenating the strings, as you would add one too many commas (either before or after the last string).
I don’t want to check conditions in the loop. I don’t really want to add the first or the last string before/after the loop (I guess this is maybe the best way?).</p>

<p>Can someone show me an elegant solution? Or tell me exactly why there can’t be anything more elegant?</p>

<p>If this is true, then using an array within a scenario that requires a lot of element activity is contra-indicated due to memory and CPU utilization, correct?</p>

<p>If that is the case, shouldn't you try to avoid using an array as much as possible when you will be adding a lot of elements? Should you use iStringMap instead? If so, what happens if you need more than two dimensions AND need to add a lot of element additions. Do you just take the performance hit or is there something else that should be used?</p>
