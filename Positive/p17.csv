<p>It seems people are assuming I am talking about private or protected variables/properties only.

So, I may be starting off from a false assumption from the get go. It appears that people answering this question are maybe saying that you should have public properties and that those don't need getters and setters, which goes against what I was taught, and what I was talking about, although maybe that needs to be discussed as well. That's probably a good topic for a different question though...</p>

As I understand it, if I do this, when a group with a spec ID matching the GUID is encountered and joined or created it should automatically use the matching object. I should be able to just manually tie a PeerGroup object to the group but this new method using META-INF seems to be a lot easier to manage.</p>

<p><em>Are we sure that this is actually an example of widening instead of autoboxing, or is it something else entirely?</em></p>

<p>On my initial scanning, I would agree with the statement that the output would be ""long"" on the basis of <code>i</code> being declared as a primitive and not an object.  However, if you changed </p>

<p>My specific case is that I have a mock class for a test.  There is no default constructor, but I want one to make the tests simpler to read.  I also want to wrap the exceptions thrown from the constructor into a RuntimeException.</p>

<p>So, what I want to do is effectively this:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyClassMock extends MyClass {
    public MyClassMock() {
        try {
            super(0);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
    }

    // Mocked methods
}
</code></pre>

<p>But Java complains that super isn't the first statement.</p>

<p>My workaround:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyClassMock extends MyClass {
    public static MyClassMock construct() {
        try {
            return new MyClassMock();
        } catch (Exception e) {

    public MyClassMock() throws Exception {

    }

    // Mocked methods
}

<p>Is this the best workaround?  Why doesn't Java let me do the former?</p>

<hr>

<p>My best guess as to the ""why"" is that Java doesn't want to let me have a constructed object in a potentially inconsistent state... however, in doing a mock, I don't care about that.  It seems I should be able to do the above... or at least I know that the above is safe for my case... or seems as though it should be anyways.</p>

<p>Is there a configuration file I can update to tell the JRE to use Pacific with all the associated daylight savings time information?  The time on my machine shows correctly, so it doesn't seem to be an OS-wide misconfiguration.</p>

<p>Ok, here's an update. A coworker suggested I update JAVA_OPTS in my /etc/profile to include ""-Duser.timezone=US/Pacific"", which worked (I also saw CATALINA_OPTS, which I updated as well). Actually, I just exported the change into the variables rather than use the new /etc/profile (a reboot later will pick up the changes and I will be golden).</p>

<p>However, I still think there is a better solution... there should be a configuration for Java somewhere that says what timezone it is using, or how it is grabbing the timezone. If someone knows such a setting, that would be awesome, but for now this is a decent workaround.</p>

<hr>

<p>I am using 1.5, and it is most definitely a DST problem.  As you can see, the time zone is set to not use daylight savings.  My belief is it is generically set to -8 offset rather than the specific Pacific timezone.  Since the generic -8 offset has no daylight savings info, it's of course not using it, but the question is, where do I tell Java to use Pacific time zone when it starts up?  I'm NOT looking for a programmatic solution, it should be a configuration solution.</p>

As an example, my current ugly procedure is to inject a character known to require two bytes into the structure before serializing, then replacing the two-byte character with an ASCII character and comparing the serialized array lengths. This should yield two serialized arrays where the array containing the two-byte characters should have length +1.</p>

<p>Plus if the solution is elegant for Java. 
I can't think of any elegant way to seek for a byte sequence in a byte array. (Could be used to seek for a known byte sequence representing the desired character representation in UTF-8.)</p>

<p><strong>edit:</strong> Ok, I to be exact about my point: Do you obfuscate to protect your IP (your algorithms, the work you've put into your product)? I won't obfuscate for security reasons, that doesn't feel right. So I'm only talking about protecting your applications code against competitors.</p>

<p>Most of our code is Java at the moment, so we've been looking at <a href=""http://commons.apache.org/configuration/"">Apache Commons Config</a>, but we've found it to be quite verbose. We've also looked at <a href=""http://xmlbeans.apache.org/"">XMLBeans</a>, but it seems like a lot of faffing around.

<p>I'm writing a small display to show customers what days they can water their lawns based on their watering group (ABCDE) and what time of year it is.  Our seasons look like this:
Summer (5-1 to 8-31) 
Spring  (3-1 to 4-30) 
Fall (9-1 to 10-31)
Winter (11-1 to 2-28) </p>

<p>An example might be:</p>

<p>If I'm in group A, here would be my allowed times:
Winter: Mondays only
Spring: Tues, Thurs, Sat
Summer: Any Day
Fall: Tues, Thurs, Sat</p>

<p>If I was writing this in PHP I would use arrays like this:</p>

<pre><code>//M=Monday,t=Tuesday,T=Thursday.... etc
$schedule[""A""][""Winter""]='M';
$schedule[""A""][""Spring""]='tTS';
$schedule[""A""][""Summer""]='Any';
$schedule[""A""][""Fall""]='tTS';
$schedule[""B""][""Winter""]='t';
</code></pre>

<p>I COULD make the days arrays (array(""Tuesday"",""Thursday"",""Saturday"")) etc, but it is not necessary for what I'm really trying to accomplish.</p>

<p>I will also need to setup arrays to determine what season I'm in:</p>

<pre><code>$seasons[""Summer""][""start""]=0501;
$seasons[""Summer""][""end""]=0801;
</code></pre>

<p>Can anyone suggest a really cool way to do this? I will have today's date and the group letter.  I will need to get out of my function a day (M) or a series of days (tTS), (Any).</p>

<p>Thanks, folks!</p>

The same app on other servers does not exhibit this behavior. This happens on WebSphere and Tomcat.  The environment is tricky to set up so it is difficult to try to do something like profiling within Eclipse.</p>

<p>Is there a way to profile (or some other method of inspecting) an existing Java app running in Tomcat to find out what methods are being executed while it's in this spinwait kind of state?  The app is only executing one method when it gets in this state (vendor's method). Vendor can't replicate the behavior (of course).</p>

<hr>

<p>Update:  </p>

<p>Using JConsole I was able to determine who was running and what they were doing.  It took me a few hours to then figure out why it was doing it.  The problem ended up being that the vendor's API jar that was being used did not match exactly to the the database configuration that it was using.  It was defaulting to having tracing and performance monitoring enabled on the servers that had the slight mis-match in configuration.  I used a different jar and all is well.</p>

<p>So thanks, Joshua, for your answer. JConsole was extremely easy to setup and use to monitor an existing application. </p>

<p>@Cringe - I did some experimenting with some of the options you suggested.  I had some problems with getting JProfiler set up, it looks good (but pricey).  Going forward I went ahead and added the Eclipse Profiler plugin and I'll be looking over the different open source profilers to compare functionality.</p>

<pre class=""lang-jsp prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;p&gt;

<p>Problems:</p>

<ol>
<li><em><strong>DRY violation</strong></em> - I have N references to my Struts action URLs instead of 1, which makes refactoring action URLs error-prone.</li>
<li><em><strong>Mixed concerns</strong></em> - My application's markup is now in more than just my JSP files, making it difficult for a web specialist to tweak the markup (using CSS, etc).</li>
<li><em><strong>Post-translation markup</strong></em> - Anytime I receive newly-translated text, I must decide what to surround with the <code>&lt;a&gt;...&lt;/a&gt;</code> markup. Easy for English but less so for unfamiliar languages.</li>
</ol>

<p>I've considered adding placeholders in the messages file, like:</p>

<pre><code>alert=Please update your {0} and {1}.
</code></pre>

<p>but then the words ""address"" and ""contact information"" would somehow need to be localized, wrapped with markup, and passed to my message tag - and I can't see an easy way to do it.</p>
