<p>I've looked at templates like the one <a href=""http://blog.wired.com/monkeybites/2007/07/meet-joe-hewitt.html"">Joe Hewitt</a> has made, and also seen some templates I can purchase, which I haven't done yet.</p>

<p>I figured someone else had already started on this track and decided that I could probably leech on their newfound knowledge :)</p>

<p>So, does anyone have any pointers? I'm well aware of the problem that the more such a template/framework makes a web app look like a native iPhone app, the more likely I'm going to get into trouble because it just isn't, but for now I want a framework I can start building on, and then in the process figure out how to make it distinctive enough to be perceived as a web app as well as looking like a native iPhone application.</p>

<p>Specifically I'm looking for features like:</p>

<ul>
<li>stylesheets set up, or pointers to how to do them for iPhone</li>
<li>page flipping animation, ie. pick an item in a list, list scrolls out of view to the left and information for item scrolls in from the right</li>
<li>the animation part would have to work with dynamic pages, ie. not just one big page that has divs set up for each sub-item, which at least one such framework had as a sort of quick fix, I would need to have list item picking load the <em>page</em> for that item, and then when loaded, scroll to it</li>
</ul>

<p><hr /></p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: To avoid people reading only the question and answering, before reading my other reply, I'll add my clarification for GPL licensing and similar issues here.</p>

<p>The framework I need to use can not be distributed under a license which would require me to license my own project out under a similar license. The GPL family of licenses allows for exceptions regarding library usage, but this won't apply to this since by necessity, the kind of framework I would need to use would be all source code.</p>

<p>The project can easily accomodate commercial libraries.</p>

<p>Also, I don't need a <em>library</em> or a <em>framework</em> as such, example files that look good and aren't overly obfuscated would be welcome as well.</p>

<p>Let's assume I know nothing about OpenGL (which is not entirely true, but it's been a while since I last used OpenGL).  I am most interested in learning this for iPhone-related development, but I'm interested in learning how it works on other platforms as well.</p>

<p>I've found the book <em>OpenGL ES 2.0 Programming Guide</em>, but I am concerned that it might not be the best approach because it focuses on 2.0 rather than 1.x.  My understanding is that 2.0 is not backwards-compatible with 1.x, so I may miss out on some important concepts.</p>

Recently started to do some iPhone programming as a side project so I'm using Apple platforms for the first time since my Apple II days. I'm wondering what other developers that are coming to Mac OSX, Xcode and iPhone SDK think. Here are my impressions, so far:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Mac OSX: very confusing, I tend to end up with too many open windows and don't know what's where. Luckily there's the bird's eye view, without it I'd be lost. With the shell at least there's all the familiar stuff so that helps me a lot.</p></li>
<li><p>Xcode: doesn't feel as good as VisualStudio or Eclipse, the two environments I'm familiar with. I think I could get used to it but I'm wondering if Apple wouldn't be better off with Eclipse. Before I found the setting where all the windows are stuck together I hated it, now I can tolerate it.</p></li>
<li><p>iPhone SDK: strange indeed. I understand Apple's desire to control their environment but in this day and age it just seems a little sleazy and they are missing out on so much by destroying developer goodwill.</p></li>
<li><p>Objective-C: I've known about it for years but never even took a look at it. The syntax is off-putting but I'm actually very intrigued by the language. I think it's an interesting third leg between C++ and C#, both of which I like a lot. Is there any chance Obj-C will break out of the Mac sandbox due to the uptick in the popularity of Apple technology?</p></li>

<p>I wonder whether this is contributing to the slow startup times.  My app is very simple.  It is basically a Twitter-like posting client. The only multimedia function is to pick an image from the camera or library, and it uses simple NSURL / NSURLConnection functions to post data to a couple of web services.</p>

<p>This is a jailbroken 2.1 iPhone with a few apps installed from Cydia.  Is this normal?</p>

<p>Is there anything else, or do I have to buy a Mac?</p>
