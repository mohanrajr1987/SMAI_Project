<p>One such situation is when you encounter validation errors after a form submission and need to redirect back to the form, but would like the URL to reflect the URL of the form, not the action page it submits to.</p>

<p>As I require the form to contain the originally <code>POST</code>ed data, for user convenience, as well as validation purposes, how can I pass the data through the RedirectToAction()?  If I use the viewData parameter, my <code>POST</code> parameters will be changed to <code>GET</code> parameters.</p>

In the past, I've open-sourced quite a few PHP scripts and UNIX-based stuff. For those, I typically went with a BSD/Apache style license, unless I was including a library that prevented it. On the Linux/PHP side of things, that usually meant something that was GPL-ed, thus still resulting in a fairly clear-cut arrangement.</p>

<p>For this project, however, I'm trying to figure out which licenses are even <strong>possible</strong> to apply to this project and not finding any good resource to answer the question. I know that the only ""real"" answer to this question would involve a lawyer. However, as this isn't something that's going to generate revenue, if I'm going to kick in $1000 toward the project, I'd rather hire a graphic designer or a usability expert to take a pass at the application than pay a lawyer.</p>

<p>This particular project also uses Subsonic for database access and Argotic for RSS parsing, further complicating the issue. </p>

<p>I know that I'm allowed to use all of those pieces and that I can redistribute my project that uses them all. However, what I'm left with is confusion over what the resulting project can/must be licensed under.</p>

<p>I can probably negotiate my way through the maze for the Subsonic and Argotic bits because they're already under open source licenses, but I can't be the only one trying to figure out what license I can apply to a project I write on top of ASP.NET MVC.</p>

<p>In response to the comments:</p>

<p>I'm not ""scared"" of anything. I'm just attempting to put the same care into the licensing and distribution of this eventual application that I am into the architecture and development of it. Beyond that, I've watched lives ruined because of not paying attention to the arguably byzantine intellectual property laws on the books today.</p>

<p>And, quite frankly, I've actually gotten a nasty letter in the past from the lawyer of an open source component that I included in an <strong>open source</strong> project of my own, but used a license that they weren't happy with.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, ""an open-source license"" isn't any more specific in legal terms than saying, ""just use a web programming language and you'll be fine"". GPL is clearly one of the most popular open source licenses out there and also one of the few that, on the face of it, can't be applied to ASP.NET MVC applications. I'm curious if there <strong>is</strong> an existing license that can actually be ""compiled"" with the other licenses of the components I'm using without throwing a legal ""compiler"" error.</p>

<p>I'm not saying the answer is simple (it's not). I asked the question because I'm genuinely interested in an answer that comes from a perspective of having examined the issue closely. When I initially posted it, I fully expected it to sit unanswered for a long time because it's not a simple question.</p>

<p>So how do you go about actually using this facility so that I can have something like this work in my Controller:</p>

<pre><code>public ActionResult Insert(Contact contact)
{
    if (this.ViewData.ModelState.IsValid)
    {
        this.contactService.SaveContact(contact);

        return this.RedirectToAction(""Details"", new { id = contact.ID}
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Problem: Now I have an action being accessed by a console app. Whats the quickest way to have this action respond w/ status 401 instead of redirecting the request to the login page? </p>

<p>I want the console app to be able to react to this 401 StatusCode instead of it being transparent. I'd also like to keep the default, redirect unauthorized requests to login page behavior.</p>

<p>Note: As a test I added this to my global.asax and it didn't bypass forms auth:</p>

<pre><code>protected void Application_AuthenticateRequest(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    HttpContext.Current.SkipAuthorization = true;
}
</code></pre>

<p>@Dale and Andy</p>

<p>I'm using the AuthorizeAttributeFilter provided in MVC preview 4. This is returning an HttpUnauthorizedResult. This result is correctly setting the statusCode to 401. The problem, as i understand it, is that asp.net is intercepting the response (since its taged as a 401) and redirecting to the login page instead of just letting it go through. I want to bypass this interception for certain urls.</p>

I've looked around online (CodeCampServer, etc...) and they all seem to suffer the same issue wherein controller methods violate SRP (single responsibility principle) pretty consistently - such as a controller method that simply renders the view if the request is a GET but updates the model if it's a POST. Now I've got controller methods responsible for multiple logical routes throughout the application - say it checks for which button was clicked on the form and acts accordingly. I could redirect each button click to a different form action using JavaScript, but something doesn't feel right there either... The other big issue is the proliferation of magic strings - ViewData[""foo""] = blah; Long story short, how do you guys structure your controller logic? One giant model object per view? Lots of little controller methods and JavaScript is the router? My goal is maintainable code - as features get piled on I'm starting to slide down that slippery slope...</p>

<p>Suppose I have a CreateEgg page, which has a form on it, and once the form is filled in and submitted the user is taken to a ListEggs page with the new egg in it.</p>

<p>So my egg controller will look some thing like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class EggController : Controller
{
    public void Add()
    {
        //do stuff

        RenderView(""CreateEgg"", viewData);
    }

    public void Create()
    {
        //do stuff

        RenderView(""ListEggs"", viewData);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So my first page will have a url of something like <a href=""http://localhost/egg/add"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost/egg/add</a> and the form on the page will have an action of:</p>

<pre><code>using (Html.Form&lt;EggController&gt;(c =&gt; c.Create())
</code></pre>

<p>Meaning the second page will have a url of <a href=""http://localhost/Egg/Create"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost/Egg/Create</a>, to me this is misleading, the action should be called Create, because im creating the egg, but a list view is being displayed so the url of <a href=""http://localhost/Egg/List"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost/Egg/List</a> would make more scene. How do I achieve this without making my view or action names misleading?</p>

<p>The two alternatives are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>ASP.NET (MVC/WebForms) with XSL</strong><br/>
Getting the data from the database and transforming it to XML which is then displayed on the different pages with XSL-templates.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ASP.NET MVC</strong><br />
Getting the data from the database as C# objects (or LinqToSql/EF-objects) and displaying it with inline-code on MVC-pages.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The main benefit of XSL has been consistent display of data on many different pages, like WebControls. So, correct me if I'm wrong, ASP.NET MVC can be used the same way, but with strongly typed objects. Please help me see if there are any benefits to XSL.</p>

<p>I'm wondering about how user controls work in ASP.NET MVC. We have tons of <code>.ASCX</code> controls, and a few composite controls.  When I work with web designers it is very easy to get them to use ASCX controls effectively, even without any programming knowledge, so that's a definite plus.  But then of course the downsides are the page life cycle, which can be maddening, and the fact that ASCX controls are hard to share between different projects.  Composite controls are share-able, but basically a black box to a designer.</p>

<p>What's the model in ASP.NET MVC?  Is there a way to create controls that solves the problems we've dealt with using ASCX and composite controls?  Allowing easy access for web designers without having to worry about code being broken is an important consideration.</p>
