<p>My personal preference would be to utilize a prefix for instance variables both for clarity within functions and to prevent shadowing of function parameters.

I'm wondering what other developers that are coming to Mac OSX, Xcode and iPhone SDK think. Here are my impressions, so far:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Mac OSX: very confusing, I tend to end up with too many open windows and don't know what's where. Luckily there's the bird's eye view, without it I'd be lost. With the shell at least there's all the familiar stuff so that helps me a lot.</p></li>
<li><p>Xcode: doesn't feel as good as VisualStudio or Eclipse, the two environments I'm familiar with. I think I could get used to it but I'm wondering if Apple wouldn't be better off with Eclipse. Before I found the setting where all the windows are stuck together I hated it, now I can tolerate it.</p></li>
<li><p>iPhone SDK: strange indeed. I understand Apple's desire to control their environment but in this day and age it just seems a little sleazy and they are missing out on so much by destroying developer goodwill.</p></li>
<li><p>Objective-C: I've known about it for years but never even took a look at it. The syntax is off-putting but I'm actually very intrigued by the language. I think it's an interesting third leg between C++ and C#, both of which I like a lot. Is there any chance Obj-C will break out of the Mac sandbox due to the uptick in the popularity of Apple technology?</p></li>

<p>First they state:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you try to set a to-many relationship to a new NSMutableSet object, it will (eventually) fail.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><em>Eventually?!</em></strong> What does that even mean? Will it fail later during <code>-[NSManagedObjectContext save:]</code>? When an managed object is turned into a fault and then paged back in? When? Can I write a test case to consistently recreate the failure on-demand?</p>

<p>Second, providing sample code to correctly handle this case, they write:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>first get the existing set using <code>primitiveValueForKey:</code> (ensure the method does not return <code>nil</code>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What should I do if/when the method <em>does</em> return nil? <code>assert()</code> it and fail immediately because that means the entire object graph is corrupted and saving will lead to data loss? <code>NSAssert()</code> on it as a warning to the caller but press on (silently doing nothing)?</p>

<p>Right now I'm simply directly assigning my desired <code>NS[Mutable]Set</code> in that case, like so:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)setChildren:(NSSet*)value_ {
    NSMutableSet *mutableRelationshipSet = [[[self primitiveValueForKey:@""children""] mutableCopy] autorelease];
    if (mutableRelationshipSet) {
        [mutableRelationshipSet setSet:value_];
        [self setPrimitiveValue:mutableRelationshipSet forKey:@""children""];
    } else {
        [self setPrimitiveValue:value_ forKey:@""children""];
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Is that wrong?</p>

<p>It feels like it should be possible to get text to wrap without creating a custom cell, since a <code>UITableViewCell</code> contains a <code>UILabel</code> by default. I know I can make it work if I create a custom cell, but that's not what I'm trying to achieve - I want to understand why my current approach doesn't work.</p>

<p>I've figured out that the label is created on demand (since the cell supports text and image access, so it doesn't create the data view until necessary), so if I do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>cell.text = @""""; // create the label
UILabel* label = (UILabel*)[[cell.contentView subviews] objectAtIndex:0];
</code></pre>

<p>then I get a valid label, but setting <code>numberOfLines</code> on that (and lineBreakMode) doesn't work - I still get single line text. There is plenty of height in the <code>UILabel</code> for the text to display - I'm just returning a large value for the height in <code>heightForRowAtIndexPath</code>.</p>

<pre><code>NSMutableArray *tmp = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];
</code></pre>

<p>I them pass that to a routine in another class</p>

<pre><code>- (BOOL)myRoutine: (NSMutableArray *)inArray
{
    // Adds items to the array -- if I break at the end of this function, the inArray variable has a count of 10
}

<p>But when the code comes back into the calling routine, [tmp count] is 0.</p>

<p>I must be missing something very simple and yet very fundamental, but for the life of me I can't see it.  Can anyone point out what I'm doing wrong?</p>

<p>EDIT: www.stray-bits.com asked if I have retained a reference to it, and I said ""maybe...we tried this:  NSMutableArray *tmp = [[[NSMutableArray alloc] init] retain]; not sure if that is what you mean, or if I did it right.</p>

<p>EDIT2:  Mike McMaster and Andy -- you guys are probably right, then.  I don't have the code here (it's on a colleague's machine and they have left for the day), but to fill the array with values we were doing something along the lines of using a decoder(?) object.  </p>

<p>The purpose of this function is to open a file from the iPhone, read that file into an array (it's an array of objects that we saved in a previous run of the program).  That ""decoder"" thing has a method that puts data into the array.  </p>

<p>Man, I've totally butchered this.  I really hope you all can follow, and thanks for the advice.  We'll look more closely at it.</p>

Given I own an iPhone, am ready to spring for a MacBook next month, and am generally interested in getting started with Mac OS developmentmt (using Objective C), I thought I would just put this question out there: What Next?</p>

<p>More specifically, what books should I pick up, and are there any web resources that some folks could point me to?  Some books that I am planning to purchase:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0321566157"">Programming in Objective-C 2.0</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0321503619"">Cocoa(R) Programming for Mac OS X (3rd Edition)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Anyone familiar with these titles?  Finally, I would be very interested in a summary of what I should be prepared to expect, once I embark on this journey.  As someone that develops in Java using IntelliJ IDEA, what are some key differences I will notice as I move over to writing ObjectiveC code in Xcode?  What's the differences between Mac OS desktop development and iPhone development? Being used to Java garbage collection, what should I know about ObjectiveC garbage collection / memory management.  Any other language specific issues that anyone would like to point out?  How about building UIs?  Is it closer to Swing, building Visual C++ resource files that code interacts with, or is it more like some of the borland IDEs that will generate code for guis?</p>
