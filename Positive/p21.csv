I've been given a database with nearly 300 tables in it and I need to turn this into a MySQL database.  My first call was to use bcp but unfortunately it doesn't produce valid CSV - strings aren't encapsulated, so you can't deal with any row that has a string with a comma in it (or whatever you use as a delimiter) and I would still have to hand write all of the create table statements, as obviously CSV doesn't tell you anything about the data types.</p>

<p>What would be better is if there was some tool that could connect to both SQL Server and MySQL, then do a copy. You lose views, stored procedures, trigger, etc, but it isn't hard to copy a table that only uses base types from one DB to another... is it?</p>

<p>Does anybody know of such a tool?  I don't mind how many assumptions it makes or what simplifications occur, as long as it supports integer, float, datetime and string.

<p>Here's our setup. Each developer has a virtual machine running our app and the MySQL database. It is their personal sandbox to do whatever they want. Currently, developers will make a change to the SQL schema and do a dump of the database to a text file that they commit into SVN.</p>

<p>We're wanting to deploy a continuous integration development server that will always be running the latest committed code. If we do that now, it will reload the database from SVN for each build.</p>

<p>We have a test (virtual) server that runs ""release candidates."" Deploying to the test server is currently a very manual process, and usually involves me loading the latest SQL from SVN and tweaking it. Also, the data on the test server is inconsistent. You end up with whatever test data the last developer to commit had on his sandbox server.</p>

<p>Where everything breaks down is the deployment to production. Since we can't overwrite the live data with test data, this involves manually re-creating all the schema changes. If there were a large number of schema changes or conversion scripts to manipulate the data, this can get really hairy.</p>

<p>If the problem was just the schema, It'd be an easier problem, but there is ""base"" data in the database that is updated during development as well, such as meta-data in security and permissions tables.</p>

<p>This is the biggest barrier I see in moving toward continuous integration and one-step-builds. How do <strong><em>you</em></strong> solve it?</p>

<hr>

<p>A follow-up question: how do you track database versions so you know which scripts to run to upgrade a given database instance? Is a version table like Lance mentions below the standard procedure?</p>

<hr>

<p>Thanks for the reference to Tarantino. I'm not in a .NET environment, but I found their <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/tarantino/wiki/DatabaseChangeManagement"">DataBaseChangeMangement wiki page</a> to be very helpful. Especially this <a href=""http://tarantino.googlecode.com/svn/docs/Database-Change-Management.ppt"">Powerpoint Presentation (.ppt)</a></p>

<p>I'm going to write a Python script that checks the names of <code>*.sql</code> scripts in a given directory against a table in the database and runs the ones that aren't there in order based on a integer that forms the first part of the filename. If it is a pretty simple solution, as I suspect it will be, then I'll post it here.</p>

<hr>

<p>I've got a working script for this. It handles initializing the DB if it doesn't exist and running upgrade scripts as necessary. There are also switches for wiping an existing database and importing test data from a file. It's about 200 lines, so I won't post it (though I might put it on pastebin if there's interest).</p>

<p>I'm using Pylons (a python framework) to serve a simple web application, but it seems to die from time to time, with this in the error log: <code>(2006, 'MySQL server has gone away')</code></p>

<p>I did a bit of checking, and saw that this was because the connections to MySQL were not being renewed. This shouldn't be a problem though, because the <code>sqlalchemy.pool_recycle</code> in the config file should automatically keep it alive. The default was <code>3600</code>, but I dialed it back to <code>1800</code> because of this problem. It helped a bit, but <code>3600</code> <em>should</em> be fine according to the docs. The errors still happen semi-regularly. I don't want to lower it too much though and DOS my own database :).</p>

<p>Why do I need to support a variable number of arguments, you ask?

<p>Part of the operations team remit is writing very complex ad-hoc SQL queries. Not surprisingly, operators sometimes make mistakes in the queries they write because they are so busy. </p>

<p>Luckily, their queries are all SELECTs not data-changing SQL, and they are running on a copy of the database anyway. Still, we'd like to prevent errors in the SQL they run. For instance, sometimes the mistakes lead to long-running queries that slow down the duplicate system they're using and inconvenience others until we find the culprit query and kill it. Worse, occasionally the mistakes lead to apparently-correct answers that we don't catch until much later, with consequent embarrassment. </p>

<p>Our developers also make mistakes in complex code that they write, but they have Eclipse and various plugins (such as <a href=""http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""FindBugs"">FindBugs</a>) that catch errors as they type. I'd like to give operators something similar - ideally it would see</p>

<pre><code>SELECT U.NAME, C.NAME FROM USER U, COMPANY C WHERE U.NAME = 'ibell';
</code></pre>

<p>and before you executed, it would say ""Hey, did you realise that's a Cartesian product? Are you sure you want to do that?"" It doesn't have to be very smart - finding obviously missing join conditions and similar evident errors would be fine.</p>

From what I seem to be reading, InnoDB is good if transactions are needed since row level locking is supported.</p>

<p>Does anybody have any experience with this type of load (or higher)?  Is MyISAM the way to go?</p>

"20426","1","21636","","2008-08-21 16:20:12","","1","912","<p>I have a tree encoded in a MySQL database as edges:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE items (
    num INT,
    tot INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (num)
    );
CREATE TABLE tree (
    orig INT,
    term INT
    FOREIGN KEY (orig,term) REFERENCES items (num,num)
    )
</code></pre>

<p>For each leaf in the tree, <code>items.tot</code> is set by someone. For interior nodes, <code>items.tot</code> needs to be the sum of it's children. Running the following query repeatedly would generate the desired result.</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE items SET tot = (
    SELECT SUM(b.tot) FROM
        tree JOIN items AS b
        ON tree.term = b.num 
        WHERE tree.orig=items.num)
    WHERE EXISTS 
        (SELECT * FROM tree WHERE orig=items.num)
</code></pre>

<p>(note this actually doesn't work but that's beside the point)</p>

<p>Assume that the database exists and the invariant are already satisfied. </p>

<p>The question is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>What is the most practical way to update the DB while maintaining this requirement? Updates may move nodes around or alter the value of <code>tot</code> on leaf nodes. It can be assumed that leaf nodes will stay as leaf nodes, interior nodes will stay as interior nodes and the whole thing will remain as a proper tree.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some thoughts I have had:</p>

<ul>
<li>Full Invalidation, after any update, recompute everything (Um... No)</li>
<li>Set a trigger on the items table to update the parent of any row that is updated
<ul>
<li>This would be recursive (updates trigger updates, trigger updates, ...)</li>
<li>Doesn't work, MySQL can't update the table that kicked off the trigger</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Set a trigger to schedule an update of the parent of any row that is updated
<ul>
<li>This would be iterative (get an item from the schedule, processing it schedules more items)</li>
<li>What kicks this off? Trust client code to get it right?</li>
<li>An advantage is that if the updates are ordered correctly fewer sums need to be computer. But that ordering is a complication in and of it's own.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>An ideal solution would generalize to other ""aggregating invariants""</p>

<p>FWIW I know this is ""a bit overboard"", but I'm doing this for fun (Fun: verb, Finding the impossible by doing it. :-)</p>

<p>I like to keep things simple, even with .NET.  I generally write stored procedures for everything, and I have a helper class that wraps all calls to execute procedures and return data sets.  I'm not looking for a full-blown ORM, but it might be the way to go and others who view this question might be looking for that.  </p>
