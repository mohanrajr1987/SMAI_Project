"20081","1","97091","","2008-08-21 14:29:48","","3","4856","<p>I've written PL/SQL code to denormalize a table into a much-easer-to-query form. The code uses a temporary table to do some of its work, merging some rows from the original table together.</p>

<p>The logic is written as a <a href=""http://www.oreillynet.com/lpt/a/3136"" rel=""nofollow"">pipelined table function</a>, following the pattern from the linked article. The table function uses a <code>PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION</code> declaration to permit the temporary table manipulation, and also accepts a cursor input parameter to restrict the denormalization to certain ID values.</p>

<p>I then created a view to query the table function, passing in all possible ID values as a cursor (other uses of the function will be more restrictive).</p>

<p>My question: is this all really necessary? Have I completely missed a much more simple way of accomplishing the same thing?</p>

<p>Every time I touch PL/SQL I get the impression that I'm typing way too much.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I'll add a sketch of the table I'm dealing with to give everyone an idea of the denormalization that I'm talking about. The table stores a history of employee jobs, each with an activation row, and (possibly) a termination row. It's possible for an employee to have multiple simultaneous jobs, as well as the same job over and over again in non-contiguous date ranges. For example:</p>

<pre><code>| EMP_ID | JOB_ID | STATUS | EFF_DATE    | other columns...
|      1 |     10 | A      | 10-JAN-2008 |
|      2 |     11 | A      | 13-JAN-2008 |
|      1 |     12 | A      | 20-JAN-2008 |
|      2 |     11 | T      | 01-FEB-2008 |
|      1 |     10 | T      | 02-FEB-2008 |
|      2 |     11 | A      | 20-FEB-2008 |
</code></pre>

<p>Querying that to figure out who is working when in what job is non-trivial. So, my denormalization function populates the temporary table with just the date ranges for each job, for any <code>EMP_ID</code>s passed in though the cursor. Passing in <code>EMP_ID</code>s 1 and 2 would produce the following:</p>

<pre><code>| EMP_ID | JOB_ID | START_DATE  | END_DATE    |
|      1 |     10 | 10-JAN-2008 | 02-FEB-2008 |
|      2 |     11 | 13-JAN-2008 | 01-FEB-2008 |
|      1 |     12 | 20-JAN-2008 |             |
|      2 |     11 | 20-FEB-2008 |             |
</code></pre>

<p>(<code>END_DATE</code> allows <code>NULL</code>s for jobs that don't have a predetermined termination date.)</p>

<p>As you can imagine, this denormalized form is much, much easier to query, but creating it--so far as I can tell--requires a temporary table to store the intermediate results (e.g., job records for which the activation row has been found, but not the termination...yet). Using the pipelined table function to populate the temporary table and then return its rows is the only way I've figured out how to do it.</p>

<p>As the number of supporting detail records has grown into the millions, the performance of the system has significantly degraded.

<p>Partioning, indexing, explain plans, and running statistics are things that have been done on the DB side to try to help improve performance. While they've helped, they haven't solved the issue satisfactorily. The toughest part in analyzing performance data is that the database and web servers are remotely administered by a different part of the IT organization, so the developers don't have regular, full access to see what's going on (especially in the production environment, which is not mirrored exactly in any other development/testing environment).  </p>

<p>The application need to prefetch a batch of 100 IDs from a sequence. It's relatively easy to do in a single-threaded, non-distributed environment, you can just issue these queries:</p>

<pre><code>select seq.nextval from dual;
alter sequence seq increment by 100;
select seq.nextval from dual;
</code></pre>

<p>The first select fetches the first sequence ID that the application can use, the second select returns the last one that can be used.</p>

<p>Things get way more interesting in a multithreaded environment. You can't be sure that before the second select another thread doesn't increase the sequence by 100 again. This issue can be solved by synchronizing the access on the Java side - you only let one thread begin fetching the IDs at one time.</p>

<p>The situation becomes really hard when you can't synchronize because parts of the application doesn't run on the same JVM, not even on the same physical machine. I found some references on forums that others have problems with solving this problem too, but none of the answers are really working not to mention being reasonable.</p>

<p>Can the community provide a solution for this problem?</p>

<p>Some more information:</p>

<ul>
<li>I can't really play with the transaction isolation levels. I use JPA and the change would affect the entire application, not only the prefetching queries and that's not acceptable for me.</li>
<li><p>On PostgreSQL I could do the following:</p>

<p>select setval('seq', nextval('seq') + n - 1 )</p></li>
<li><p>The solution by Matthew works when you can use a fixed increment value (which is perfectly acceptable in my case). However is there a solution when you don't want to fix the size of the increment, but want to adjust it dynamically?</p></li>

<p>Things have restarted fine, however, we now can't connect to the Apache service, we're getting the error:</p>

<p>This seems to point to a problem with the root certs, but in my opinion, these are registered with the Wallet correctly.</p>

<p>This works, but I have to duplicate the test deptno = 20 and job = 'CLERK', which I would like to avoid. Is there a more elegant way to write this, maybe using a <code>group by</code>? BTW, if this matters, I am using Oracle.</p>

<pre><code>@CollectionOfElements(fetch = EAGER)

@Column(name = ""substitution"")
@IndexColumn(name = ""listIndex"", base = 0)
@Lob
private List&lt;String&gt; substitutions;

<p>So basically I may have a Note with some subsitutions, say <code>""foo""</code> and <code>""fizzbuzz""</code>. So in my main table I could have a Note with id 4 and in my <code>NOTE_JOIN_TABLE</code> I would have two rows, <code>""foo""</code> and <code>""fizzbuzz""</code> that both have a relationship to the Note.</p>

<p>However, when one of these is inserted into the DB <strong>the larger substitution values are cropped to be as long as the shortest.</strong> So in this case I would have <code>""foo""</code> and <code>""fiz""</code> in the DB instead of <code>""foo""</code> and <code>""fizzbuzz""</code>.</p>

<p>Do you have any idea why this is happening? I have checked and confirmed they aren't being cropped anywhere in our code, it's defintely hibernate.</p>
