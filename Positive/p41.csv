I have chosen a threaded timer as the other types can drift if the main thread is busy, and I need this to be reliable.</p>

<p>The way this timer works in the control of the timer is put on another thread so it can always tick along with the work begin completed on the parent thread when it is not busy.</p>

<p>The issue with this timer in a console application is that while the timer is ticking along on another thread the main thread is not doing anything so the application closes.</p>

<p>I tried adding a <code>while true</code> loop, but then the main thread is too busy when the timer does go off.</p>

"109","1","2585","","2008-08-01 15:23:05","","24","4073","<p>Recently our site has been deluged with the resurgence of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asprox_botnet"">Asprox botnet</a> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection"">SQL injection</a> attack. Without going into details, the attack attempts to execute SQL code by encoding the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transact-SQL"">T-SQL</a> commands in an ASCII encoded BINARY string. It looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>DECLARE%20@S%20NVARCHAR(4000);SET%20@S=CAST(0x44004500...06F007200%20AS%20NVARCHAR(4000));EXEC(@S);--
</code></pre>

<p>I was able to decode this in SQL, but I was a little wary of doing this since I didn't know exactly what was happening at the time.</p>

<p>I tried to write a simple decode tool, so I could decode this type of text without even touching <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SQL_Server"">SQL&nbsp;Server</a>. The main part I need decoded is:</p>

<pre><code>CAST(0x44004500...06F007200 AS
NVARCHAR(4000))
</code></pre>

<p>I've tried all of the following commands with no luck:</p>

<pre><code>txtDecodedText.Text =
    System.Web.HttpUtility.UrlDecode(txtURLText.Text);
txtDecodedText.Text =
    Encoding.ASCII.GetString(Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(txtURLText.Text));
txtDecodedText.Text =
    Encoding.Unicode.GetString(Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(txtURLText.Text));
txtDecodedText.Text =
    Encoding.ASCII.GetString(Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(txtURLText.Text));
txtDecodedText.Text =
    Encoding.Unicode.GetString(Convert.FromBase64String(txtURLText.Text));
</code></pre>

<p>What is the proper way to translate this encoding without using SQL Server? Is it possible? I'll take VB.NET code since I'm familiar with that too.</p>

<hr>

<p>Okay, I'm sure I'm missing something here, so here's where I'm at.</p>

<p>Since my input is a basic string, I started with just a snippet of the encoded portion - 4445434C41 (which translates to DECLA) - and the first attempt was to do this...</p>

<pre><code>txtDecodedText.Text = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(txtURL.Text));
</code></pre>

<p>...and all it did was return the exact same thing that I put in, since it converted each character into is byte.</p>

<p>I realized that I need to parse each two characters into a byte manually since I don't know of any methods yet that will do that, so now my little decoder looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>while (!boolIsDone)
{
    bytURLChar = byte.Parse(txtURLText.Text.Substring(intParseIndex, 2));
    bytURL[intURLIndex] = bytURLChar;
    intParseIndex += 2;
    intURLIndex++;

    if (txtURLText.Text.Length - intParseIndex &lt; 2)
    {
        boolIsDone = true;
    }
}

txtDecodedText.Text = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(bytURL);
</code></pre>

<p>Things look good for the first couple of pairs, but then the loop balks when it gets to the ""4C"" pair and says that the string is in the incorrect format.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, when I step through the debugger and to the GetString method on the byte array that I was able to parse up to that point, I get "",-+"" as the result.</p>

<p>How do I figure out what I'm missing - do I need to do a ""direct cast"" for each byte instead of attempting to parse it?</p>

what my options are.</p>

<p>Downsides to ClickOnce:</p>

<ul>
<li>Consists of multiple files - Seems easier to distribute one file than manageing a bunch of file and the downloader to download those files.</li>
<li>You have to build it again for CD installations (for when the end user dosn't have internet)</li>
<li>Program does not end up in Program Files - It ends up hidden away in some application catch folder, making it much harder to shortcut to.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pros to ClickOnce:</p>

<ul>
<li>It works. Magically. And it's built
into VisualStudio 2008 express.</li>
<li>Makes it easy to upgrade the
application.</li>
</ul>

<p>Does Windows Installer do these things as well? I know it dosen't have any of the ClickOnce cons, but It would be nice to know if it also has the ClickOnce pros.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>:
I ended up using Wix 2 (Wix 3 was available but at the time I did the project, no one had a competent tutorial). It was nice because it supported the three things I (eventually) needed. An optional start-up-with-windows shortcut, a start-up-when-the-installer-is-done option, and three paragraphs of text that my boss thinks will keep uses from clicking the wrong option.</p>

    Dim endOfDay As Decimal = 12.0 + 5.0 ''// end of day, in hours
    Dim startOfDay As Decimal = 8.0      ''// start of day, in hours

    Dim newHour As Integer
    Dim newMinute As Integer

    Dim dateRequired As Date = Now
    Dim delta As Decimal = hours + delay

    ''// Wrap around to the next day, if necessary

<p><strong>Note</strong>: This will probably not work if delay is more than 9 hours long. It should never change from 3, through.</p>

<p>EDIT:
The goal is find the date and time that you get as a result of adding several hours to the current time. This is used to determine a default value for a due date of a submission. I want to add 3 hours to the current time to get the due date time. However, I don't want due dates that go beyond 5pm on the current day. So, I tried to have the hours split between (today, up to 5pm) and (tomorrow, from 8am on), such that adding 3 hours to 4pm would give you 19am, because 1 hour is added to the end of today and 2 hours are added to the beginning of tomorrow.</p>

<p>It doesn't have to be a 64bit program, actually, I rather prefer it to be 32bit anyway since it is more like a utility and it should work on 32bit systems.</p>

<p>Also, I'm running Vista at 64bit. Maybe that has something to do with it?</p>

<p>@Rob Cooper: Now I think of it, I never had the chance of selecting either a 64bit or a 32bit application when creating the solution/project/application...
And according to your link ""64-Bit Debugging (X64)"" is possible with MS VB2008 express edition.</p>

  <p>ConfigurationManager.AppSettings(""LOGINSUCCESS"")</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However as I could have a large number of application messages I didn't want to use the web.config directly. I was going to add a 2nd web config file and use that but of course you can only have one per virtual directory.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any suggestions on how to do this without writing much custom code?</p>

I have a project that is an api for a datastore that I created. When compiled creates api.dll.
I have a second project in the same solution that has a project reference to the api project which when compiled will create wrapper.dll. This is basically a wrapper for the api that is specific to an application.
When I use wrapper.dll in that other application, I have to copy wrapper.dll and api.dll to my new application. How can I get the wrapper project to compile the api.dll into itself so that i only have one dll to move around?</p>

<p>Post Answer Edit:</p>

<p>Thanks Daniel, looks like this will work. I'm using the first solution you posted with the GetCurrentThemeName() function.</p>

<p>I'm doing the following:</p>

<p><strong>Function Declaration:</strong>
  <pre><code> Private Declare Unicode Function GetCurrentThemeName Lib ""uxtheme"" (ByVal stringThemeName As System.Text.StringBuilder, ByVal lengthThemeName As Integer, ByVal stringColorName As System.Text.StringBuilder, ByVal lengthColorName As Integer, ByVal stringSizeName As System.Text.StringBuilder, ByVal lengthSizeName As Integer) As Int32
</pre></code></p>

<p><strong><em>Code Body:</em></strong>
<pre><code>
Dim stringThemeName As New System.Text.StringBuilder(260)
Dim stringColorName As New System.Text.StringBuilder(260)
Dim stringSizeName As New System.Text.StringBuilder(260)</p>

<p>GetCurrentThemeName(stringThemeName, 260, stringColorName, 260, stringSizeName, 260)
MsgBox(stringThemeName.ToString)
</pre></code></p>

<p>The MessageBox comes up Empty when i'm in Windows Classic Style/theme, and Comes up with ""C:\WINDOWS\resources\Themes\luna\luna.msstyles"" if it's in Windows XP style/theme. I'll have to do a little more checking to see what happens if the user sets another theme than these two, but shouldn't be a big issue.</p>
