Specifically, although I am including <code>sys/socket.h</code>, I still get compile time errors telling me that <code>AF_INET</code> is not defined. Am I missing something obvious, or could this be related to the fact that I'm doing this coding on <code>z/OS</code> and my problems are much more complicated?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Upon further investigation, I discovered that there is an #ifdef that I'm hitting. Apparently <code>z/OS</code> isn't happy unless I define which ""type"" of sockets I'm using with:</p>

<pre><code>#define _OE_SOCKETS
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I personally have no idea what this <code>_OE_SOCKETS</code> is actually for, so if any <code>z/OS</code> sockets programmers are out there (all 3 of you), perhaps you could give me a rundown of how this all works?</p>

<p>I handle the initialisation (<code>gtk_init</code>) sort of stuff inside the <code>MessageBox</code> function as follows:</p>

<pre><code>int MessageBox(HWND hwnd, const char* text, const char* caption, UINT type)
{
    GtkWidget *window = NULL;
    GtkWidget *dialog = NULL;

    gtk_init(&amp;gtkArgc, &amp;gtkArgv);

    g_signal_connect(G_OBJECT(window), ""destroy"", G_CALLBACK(destroy), NULL);
    // gcallback calls gtk_main_quit()
    gtk_init_add((GtkFunction)gcallback, NULL);

    if (type &amp; MB_YESNO) {
        dialog = gtk_message_dialog_new(GTK_WINDOW(window), GTK_DIALOG_DESTROY_WITH_PARENT, GTK_MESSAGE_QUESTION, GTK_BUTTONS_YES_NO, text);
    } else {
        dialog = gtk_message_dialog_new(GTK_WINDOW(window), GTK_DIALOG_DESTROY_WITH_PARENT, GTK_MESSAGE_INFO, GTK_BUTTONS_OK, text);
    }

    gtk_window_set_title(GTK_WINDOW(dialog), caption);
    gint result = gtk_dialog_run(GTK_DIALOG(dialog));

    gtk_main();

    gtk_widget_destroy(dialog);

    if (type &amp; MB_YESNO) {
        switch (result) {
        default:
        case GTK_RESPONSE_DELETE_EVENT:
        case GTK_RESPONSE_NO:
            return IDNO;
            break;
        case GTK_RESPONSE_YES:
            return IDYES;
            break;
        }
    }

    return IDOK;
} 
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I am by no means an experienced GTK programmer, and I realise that I'm probably doing something(s) horribly wrong.</p>

<p>However, my problem is that the last dialog popped up with this function stays around until the process exits. Any ideas?</p>

It's a little different in that it will find and replace strings, rather than characters in the starting string.</p>

<p>It's trivial to do if the search and replace strings are the same length (or the replace string is shorter than the search string), since I have enough space allocated.  If I try to use <code>realloc()</code>, I get an error that tells me I am doing a double free - which I don't see how I am, since I am only using <code>realloc()</code>.</p>

<p>Perhaps a little code will help:</p>

<pre><code>void strrep(char *input, char *search, char *replace) {
    int searchLen = strlen(search);
    int replaceLen = strlen(replace);
    int delta = replaceLen - searchLen;
    char *find = input;
    while (find = strstr(find, search)) {
        if (delta &gt; 0) {
            realloc(input, strlen(input) + delta);
            find = strstr(input, search);            
        }
        memmove(find + replaceLen, find + searchLen, strlen(input) - (find - input));
        memmove(find, replace, replaceLen);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The program works, until I try to <code>realloc()</code> in an instance where the replaced string will be longer than the initial string.  (It still kind of works, it just spits out errors as well as the result).</p>

<p>If it helps, the calling code looks like:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

void strrep(char *input, char *search, char *replace);

int main(void) {
    char *input = malloc(81);
    while ((fgets(input, 81, stdin)) != NULL) {
        strrep(input, ""Noel"", ""Christmas"");
    }
}

<p>This is a good technique as it drives home the size of the type to the programmer and makes you more conscious of chances for overflow etc.</p>

<p>But on some systems you know that the compiler and processor won't change for the life of the project.</p>

<p>So what should influence your decision to create and enforce project-specific types?</p>

<p>EDIT
I think I managed to lose the gist of my question, and maybe it's really two.</p>

<p>With embedded programming you may need types of specific size for interfaces and also to cope with restricted resources such as RAM.  This can't be avoided, but you can choose to use the basic types from the compiler.</p>

<p>For everything else the types have less importance.<br />
You need to be careful not to cause overflow and may need to watch out for register and stack usage.  Which may lead you to UINT16, UCHAR.
Using types such as UCHAR can add compiler 'fluff' however.  Because registers are typically larger, some compilers may add code to force the result into the type.<br />
<PRE>    i++;</PRE>
can become
<PRE>    ADD REG,1
    AND REG, 0xFF</PRE>
which is unecessary.</p>

<p>So I think my question should have been :-</p>

<p>given the constraints of embedded software what is the best policy to set for a project which will have many people working on it - not all of whom will be of the same level of experience.</p>

<li>@jeff - What doesnt make sense?  I am using this great service for (what I think is) a legit reason.  I want to get better at my hobby, which is all it is, as I am in high school.  Many of my posts regard implementing a genetic algorithm (This post, sparsearray, rank an array, pointer manipulation).</li>
<li>I am using a sparse array representation, as it is possible to exceed the number of molecules in the universe using a traditional (dense) array.  For now, the implementation of the sparsearray itself doesnt matter a whole lot, as I am working to make it work with a standard array before going to a sparse representation.  For those who havent seen my previous questions, I am using a binary search tree as the structure to contain the sparse array points, and a ""driver"" function to traverse the tree as necessary, returning whatever the function is designed to do.  This is flexible, so I can accomodate a lot of different methods of accessing the array. </li>
<li>The structure is a hypercube, and the number of dimensions is specified at run time, as well as the length of each dimension (which are all the same, as it is a hypercube).</li>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> GVim seems pretty neat, and KDevelop looks like it'd be good except that I'm running Gnome, and would rather not install the kde libs. I'm really impressed with Code::Blocks though, can't believe I'd never heard of it before, so I'm calling that The Answer. Thanks guys.</p>

<p>Edit:  To be clear, this is on Windows using Visual Studio 2005</p>

<p>Edit: Marked the non-def (__declspec) method as the answer...I know this doesn't actually solve the problem using def files as I wanted, but it seems that there is likely no (official) solution using def files.  Will leave the question open, however, in case someone knows something we don't have overloaded functions and def files.</p>

<ul>
<li>lib, because they are libraries. However, 'lib' has a different connotation in UNIX-world.</li>
<li>src, because they are source files.</li>
<li>3rdparty, because I didn't write it.</li>
</ul>

<p>And where should I compile these libraries to? Should I simply configure and install them to the system root, or should I set up a directory where all libraries should compile to, and link from there? Obviously, this will have ramifications for my Makefile.</p>

<p>How should I go about this? Are there established conventions that I should follow? Are they written down somewhere?</p>
