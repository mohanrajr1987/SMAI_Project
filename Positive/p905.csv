<p>Since there is no need to poll when nothing happens, I wonder, is there something that could do the same thing without frequent polling? Eg. Comet, though I heard that you need to configure server side applications for Comet. It's a shared webserver, so I can't do that.</p>

<p>Maybe prevent the handler.php file from even returning a response if nothing has to be changed at the client, is that possible? Then again you'd still have the client uselessly asking for a response even though something hasn't changed yet. Basically, it should only use bandwidth and sever resources if something needs to be told to the client, eg. the change of an object's coordinates.</p>

<p>The HTML 5 draft,  however, contains two specifications in one. First an author spec, describing the elements and attributes that HTML authors should use, and their interrelationships. Validation of an HTML 5 page is based on this spec. The elements and attributes included are not directly drawn from HTML 4, but have needed to be justified from first principles, which means that some HTML 4 features, such as the summary attribute on &lt;table&gt;, longdesc on &lt;img&gt; and the profile attribute on &lt;head&gt;, do not currently appear in this draft. Such features are not considered deprecated, they are simply not included. (Their absence from the draft remains a matter of dispute, although their inclusion any time soon does not seem likely.)</p>

<p>Second, the draft defines a browser processing specification that seeks to define exactly how a browser's parser will treat any byte stream it's given, regardless of how well formed and valid the HTML. This means that when the browsers fully support HTML 5, it will be possible to predict how any browser will treat HTML for a much wider range of inputs than merely those that pass validation.</p>

<p>In particular, because HTML 5 is defined to be 100% backward compatible with today's web, all valid HTML 4, and all invalid but commonly used mark-up, will continue to be processed exactly the same as it is today, regardless of whether it is HTML 5 valid or not.</p>

<p>Therefore, at the very minimum, anyone using any feature from HTML 5, HTML 4, or any previous version of HTML, plus many proprietary extensions, can be confident that their HTML will get consistent and predictable treatment across all browsers.</p>

<p>Given this, does it make any sense to limit ones HTML 5 to that which will validate, and what practical benefit will we get from doing so?</p>

<p>As you can probably notice, even if your latency (see title) is lower then 50ms, the shuttle will now and then ""shock"" or lag while moving/rotating. Because I wanted to find out what is causing the problem, I remade the whole thing to a client side version (without ajax).</p>

<p>You can check it out here: [<a href=""http://ajax.uptowar.com/test5/index.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ajax.uptowar.com/test5/index.php</a>][2]</p>

<p>This is the source of the client side remake:</p>

<p>However, I want to limit the width of this entire element to that of the image, so the text isn't wider than the image (wrapping to multiple lines if necessary).</p>

<p>Basic HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""figure""&gt;
&lt;img src=""..."" alt=""..."" width=""..."" height=""..."" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A description for the image
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I'm well-versed with CSS but I can't think of any pure CSS solution, without adding a <code>style=""width:100px""</code> to the <code>div</code> to match the image width.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: After a bit of searching and thinking, the best method seems to be using an inline width on the div. I will keep the width attribute on the image, in case I wish the div to be a bit wider than the image (for example to accomodate a longer caption).</p>

<p>This approach also means I could have two images side-by-side with a caption below. If I have a set of images the same size, I can of course add an extra style to each <code>div</code>.</p>

It certainly seemed to be a good method to me, but it made me curious about using features from a future spec in general.</p>

<p>HTML 5 offers a lot of nice improvements, many of which can be used without causing problems in current browsers.  </p>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<pre><code>// new, simple HTML5 doctype (puts browsers in standards mode)
&lt;!doctype HTML&gt;

// new input types,  for easy, generic client side validation
&lt;input type=""email"" name=""emailAddress""/&gt;
&lt;input type=""number"" name=""userid""/&gt;
&lt;input type=""date"" name=""dateOfBirth""/&gt;

// new ""required"" attribute indicates that a field is required
&lt;input type=""text"" name=""userName"" required=""true""/&gt;

// new 'data-' prefixed attributes
// for easy insertion of js-accessible metadata in dynamic pages
&lt;div data-price=""33.23""&gt; 
    &lt;!-- --&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;button data-item-id=""93024""&gt;Add Item&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Many of these new features are designed to make it possible for browsers to automatically validate forms, as well as give them better inputs (for example a date picker).   Some are just convenient and seem like a good way to get ready for the future.</p>

<p>They currently don't break anything (as far as I can tell) in current browsers and they allow for clean, generic clientside code.</p>

<p>However, even though they are all valid in HTML 5, they are NOT valid for HTML 4, and HTML 5 is still a draft at this point.</p>

<p><strong>Is it a good idea to go ahead and use these features early?</strong>  </p>

<p>Are there browser implementation issues with them that I haven't realized?   </p>

<p>Should we be developing web pages now that make use of HTML 5 draft features?</p>

News of this are popping up in blogs all over the place, and everyone seems to be excited. But what about?</p>

<p>As much as I searched I could not find anything that would make it better than the good old Flash video. In fact, I see only problems with it:</p>

<ul>
<li>It will still be some time before all the browsers start supporting it, and much more time before most people upgrade;</li>
<li>Flash is available already and everyone has it;</li>
<li>You can couple Flash with whatever fancy UI you want for controlling the playback. I gather that the  tag will be controllable as well (via JavaScript probably), but will it be able to go fullscreen?</li>
</ul>

<p>The only two pros for a <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag that I can see are:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is more ""semantic"" - which probably holds no importance to a whole lot of people, including me;</li>
<li>It is not dependent on a single commercial 3rd party entity (Adobe) - which I also don't see as a compelling reason to switch, because free players and video converters are already available, and Adobe is not hindering the whole process in any way (it's not in their interests even).</li>
</ul>

<p>So... what's the big deal?</p>

<p><strong>Added:</strong></p>

<p>OK, so there is one more Pro... maybe. Support for mobile devices. Hard to say though. A number of thoughts race through my head about the subject:</p>

<ul>
<li>How many mobile devices are actually able to decode video at a decent speed anyway, Flash or otherwise?</li>
<li>How long until mainstream mobile devices get the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> support? Even if it is available through updates, how many people actually do that?</li>
<li>How many people watch videos on web pages on their mobile phones at all?</li>
</ul>

<p>As for the semantics part - I understand that search engines might be able to detect videos better now, but... what will they do with them anyway? OK, so they know that there is a video in the page. And? They can't index a video! I'd like some more arguments here.</p>

<p><strong>Added:</strong></p>

<p>Just thought of another Cons. This opens up a whole new area of cross-browser incompatibility. HTML and CSS is quite messy already in this aspect. Flash at least is the same everywhere. But it's enough for at least one major browser vendor to decide against the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag (can anyone say ""Internet Explorer""?) and we have a nice new area of hell to explore.</p>

<p><strong>Added:</strong></p>

<p>A Pro just came in. More competition = more innovation. That's true. Giving Adobe more competition will probably force them to improve Flash in areas it has been lacking so far. Linux seems to be a weak spot for it, cited by many.</p>

<p>Example: The user set the background color to #ECECEC. Now I want a certain elements border to become #F4F4F4 (A color closer to white).</p>

<p>So now with the new FF, Opera, IE, is it finally time to start developing sites with HTML5 or is it still a little premature and will cause compatibility issues? </p>

<p>Is using HTML5 just going to require us to use more and more JS on websites to 'trick' older browsers into working properly? </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create an html5 page.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure you have the script from remysharp.com/2009/01/07/html5-enabling-script/ added so that IE will notice the tags.</p></li>
<li><p>Create an hardcoded <code>&lt;section id='anything'&gt;&lt;/section&gt;</code> tag.</p></li>
<li><p>Using jQuery 1.3.2, append another section tag: <code>$('#anything').append('&lt;section id=""whatever""&gt;&lt;/section&gt;');</code> So far, everything works in all the browsers.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat the previous step. <code>$('#whatever').append('&lt;section id=""fail""&gt;&lt;/section&gt;');</code> This is where IE6/7 fails. Firefox/Safari will continue working.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Error</h2>

<h2>Thoughts</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>It could be that IE6/7 can't handle the HTML5 section tag. I say this because when I change step 4 from <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, IE6/7 will start working.</p></li>
<li><p>If I use <code>document.createElement()</code> and create my new element, it works, but it seems like jQuery's <code>append()</code> has a problem with html5 elements.</p></li>

<p>It would pure HTML5 + JavaScript based client web app which would be packaged, and can be installed or launched from startup scripts.</p>

<p>Or instead of using firefox 3.5 engine, we can use Mozilla Prism to convert it to web app, and then bundle it.</p>
