<p>On a few occasions recently, I've wanted to design and code a Form object that I could plug into several other ""parent"" forms.  My goal is to create a centralized piece of code for managing several UI components in a particular way, and then be able to use that (both the UI layout and the logic) in more than one place.  I'm certainly willing to use code (rather than the Design View) to load the child form.</p>

<p>The best I've come up with so far is to pull all of the interesting logic for the child form into a Class Module, and have each parent form lay out the UI (in a Picture control, perhaps) and pass that Picture object into the class module.  The class then knows how to operate on the picture, and it assumes that all its expected pieces have been laid out appropriately.  This approach has several downsides, and I'd like something a bit more elegant.</p>","863","","3576214","","2015-01-01 23:04:26","2015-01-01 23:04:26","How do I best share an embeddable form in VB6?","<forms><vb6><code-reuse>","1","0","","","","6913","49"

I have been tasked with migrating the old data into the new schema. I have decided to do this by creating a small Windows Forms project as the schema are radically different and straight TSQL scripts are not an adequate solution.</p>

<p>The main sealed class 'ImportController' that does the work declares the following delegate event:</p>

<pre><code>public delegate void ImportProgressEventHandler(object sender, ImportProgressEventArgs e);
public static event ImportProgressEventHandler importProgressEvent;
</code></pre>

<p>The main window starts a static method in that class using a new thread:</p>

<pre><code>Thread dataProcessingThread = new Thread(new ParameterizedThreadStart(ImportController.ImportData));
dataProcessingThread.Name = ""Data Importer: Data Processing Thread"";
dataProcessingThread.Start(settings);
</code></pre>

<p>the ImportProgressEvent args carries a string message, a max int value for the progress bar and an current progress int value. The Windows form subcribes to the event:</p>

<pre><code>ImportController.importProgressEvent += new ImportController.ImportProgressEventHandler(ImportController_importProgressEvent);
</code></pre>

<p>And responds to the event in this manner using it's own delegate:</p>

<pre><code>    private delegate void TaskCompletedUIDelegate(string completedTask, int currentProgress, int progressMax);

private void ImportController_importProgressEvent(object sender, ImportProgressEventArgs e)
            {
                this.Invoke(new TaskCompletedUIDelegate(this.DisplayCompletedTask), e.CompletedTask, e.CurrentProgress, e.ProgressMax);
            }
</code></pre>

<p>Finally the progress bar and listbox are updated:</p>

<pre><code>private void DisplayCompletedTask(string completedTask, int currentProgress, int progressMax)
        {
            string[] items = completedTask.Split(new string[] { Environment.NewLine }, StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries);

            foreach (string item in items)
            {
                this.lstTasks.Items.Add(item);
            }

            if (currentProgress &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; progressMax &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; currentProgress &lt;= progressMax)
            {
                this.ImportProgressBar.Maximum = progressMax;
                this.ImportProgressBar.Value = currentProgress;
            }
        }
</code></pre>

<p>I have a VB6 application I've ""inherited"" that generates a PDF for the user to review using unsupported Acrobat Reader OCX integration.  The program generates an FDF file with the data, then renders the merged result when the FDF is merged with a PDF.  It only works correctly with Acrobat Reader 4 :-(.  Installing a newer version of Acrobat Reader breaks this application, making the users very unhappy.</p>

<p>I want to re-architect this app so that it will send the data to be merged to a PDF output generation server.  This server will merge the data passed to it onto the form, generate a PDF image of this, and store it, so that any user wishing to view the final result can then simply get the PDF (it is generated just once).  If the underlying data is changed, the PDF will be deleted and regenerated next time it is requested.  The client program can then have any version of Acrobat Reader they wish, as it will be used exclusively for displaying PDF files (as it was intended).  The server will most likely be written in .NET (C#) with Visual Studio 2005, probably as a Web Service... </p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>

<p>How would others recommend I go about this?  Should I use Adobe's Acrobat 9 at the server to do this, puting the data into FDF or Adobe's XML format, and letting Acrobat do the merge?  Are there great competitors in the ""merge data onto form and output a PDF"" space?  How do others do this?  It has to be API based, no GUI at the server, of course...</p>

<p>While some output is generated via FDF/PDF, another part of the application actually sends lines, graphics, and text to the printer (or a form for preview purposes) one page at a time, giving the proper x/y coordinates, font, size, etc. for each, knowing when it is at the end of a page, etc.  This code is currently in the program that displays this for the user to review, and it is also in the program that prints the final form to the printer.  For consistency between reviewer and printer, I'd like to move this output generation logic to a server as well, either using a good PDF generation API tool or use the code as is and generate a PDF with a PDF printer... and saving this PDF for display by the clients.</p>

<p>Googling ""Form software"" or ""fill form software"" or similar searches returns sooooooooo much unrelated material, mostly related to UI for users to fill in forms, I just don't know how to properly narrow down my search.  This site seems the perfect place to ask such a question, as other programmers must also need to generate similar outputs, and have tried out some great tools.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> </p>

<p>In the form, the CategoryID needs to be represented as a combo box that is bound to the Category table.  The idea here is pretty straightforward: selecting a new Category should update the CategoryID in the Product table.</p>

<p>The problem I'm running into is that selecting a new Category updates the CategoryName of the Category table instead of updating the CategoryID in the Product table.  The reason for this is that it seems that the combo box must be bound only to the CategoryName of the Category table.</p>

<p>What happens is if the current product has a CategoryID of 12 which is the CategoryName ""Chairs"" in the Category table then selecting a new value, let's say ""Tables"" (CategoryID 13) in the combo box updates the CategoryID of 12 with the new CategoryName ""Tables"" instead of updating the Product table CategoryID to 13.</p>

<p>How can I bind the Category table to a combox box so that the datatextfield (which I wish existed in Access) is the CategoryName and the datavaluefield is the CategoryID and only the CategoryID of the Product will be updated when the selected combo box item is changed?</p>

<p>Nick Kew's <A HREF=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0132409674"" rel=""nofollow"">Apache Modules</A> book has a section on handling form data. It provides code examples for POST and GET, which return an apr_hash_t of the key+value pairs in the form. parse_form_from_POST marshalls the bucket brigade and flattens it into a buffer, while parse_form_from_GET can simply reference the URL. Both routines rely on a parse_form_from_string routine to walk through each delimited field and extract the information into the hash table.</p>

<p>That would be fine, but it seems like there should be an easier way to do this than adding a couple hundred lines of code to my module. Is there an existing module or routines within apache, apr, or apr-util to extract the field names and associated data from a GET or POST FORM into a structure which C code can more easily access? I cannot find anything relevant, but this seems like a common need for which there should be a solution.</p>

"131759","1","179722","","2008-09-25 06:47:37","","5","684","<p>In several web application projects I've been a part of, the client asks to be able to create their own forms. The question arises on how to store their form definitions, and then how to store user inputted values into those custom forms.</p>

<p>I've seen it done two ways:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Assuming that the client only defines how many fields, and what labels are associated with those fields; we can come to a solution involving four tables.  <strong><code>FormDefinition</code></strong>, <strong><code>FormFieldDefinition</code></strong>, <strong><code>FormInstances</code></strong>, <strong><code>FormFieldValues</code></strong>. The client makes changes to <code>FormDefinition</code> and <code>FormFieldDefinition</code>, and the web app uses that information to render an HTML web form, on which the website visitor (end user) will submit the form, in which a new row in <code>FormInstances</code> is created and the values are saved in the <code>FormFieldValues</code> table.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rows in <strong><code>FormDefinition</code></strong> defines the form, i.e. <code>form definition ID = 2, form title = 'Car Registration Form'</code>. Rows in <strong><code>FormFieldDefinition</code></strong> defines fields of a form in <code>FormDefinition</code>, i.e. <code>field definition ID = 7, field label = 'Car Model', field type = 'varchar(50)'</code>. Rows in <strong><code>FormInstance</code></strong> is an instance of each form filled out by a user, i.e. <code>definition id = 2, date_entered = '2008-09-24'</code>. And rows in <strong><code>FormFieldValues</code></strong> are entries by the user, i.e. <code>field definition = 7, value = 'Tiburon'</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, it means the value column in <code>FormFieldValues</code> must be a char type of the largest possible size that your client might specify in a web form... and when form definitions change, managing old data becomes iffy.  But user entries are queryable (i wrote a <a href=""http://pastie.org/pastes/275090"" rel=""nofollow"">quick query</a> that lists user entries given a form id, which is similar to <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24470/sql-server-pivot-examples"">another pivot question</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>An alternative to using four tables would be to serialize the form definitions and user's form entries into XML (or YAML or something similar) and store that as text. The upside is that the forms are human readable in the database. The downside is that there will be more application overhead with parsing XML, and the database becomes much less queryable from an SQL standpoint.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>My real question is, what is this database model called? (So I can google this problem.) But I would settle on an answer to: which is the better implementation or are there better (or just as good) implementations out there?</p>

<p>In my opinion that would be a usability mistake. For example: In the wizard you may have multiple controls, buttons, check boxes, multiple line controls and they all have a different behavior on actions from the ENTER key. And don't forget the other buttons in the navigation of the wizard, what if they are focused?</p>

<p>Should these controls don't react on Enter like expected before? Should they do their actions but in other cases where Enter does no further action for the control it should close the form == inconsistent?</p>

<p>I think that is a typical request where the needs of one person would help him but confuse many other.</p>

<p>In my opinion Wizards are very special because they are not only made to make things easier but also very often focus on people with less experience with the functionality of an application. So I take every request serious and try to look into all arguments for and against the request.</p>

<p>Is my point of view to narrow? Are there some usability studies or guidelines especially for Wizards to backup my opinion or maybe proof me wrong?</p>
