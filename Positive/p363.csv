Some of the controls are hidden in dialog-style DIVs, so I'd like to have them load in via AJAX only when the user wants to see them.  This is fine for controls that are mostly Literal-based (various menus and widgets), but when I have what I call ""dirty"" controls - ones that write extensive information to the ViewState, put tons of CSS or script on the page, require lots of references etc - these are seemingly impossible to move ""out of page"", especially considering how ASP.NET will react on postback.</p>

<p>I was considering some kind of step where I override Render, find markers for the bits I want to move out and put AJAX placeholders in there, but not only does the server overhead seem extreme, it also feels like a complete hack.  Besides, the key element here are the dialog boxes that contain forms with validation controls on them, and I can't imagine how I would move the controls <em>and</em> their required scripts.</p>

<p>In my fevered imagination, I want to do this:</p>

<pre><code>AJAXifier.AJAXify(ctlEditForm);

<p>Sadly, I know this is a dream.  How close can I really get to a quick-and-easy AJAXification without causing too much load on the server?</p>

"2328","1","4910","","2008-08-05 13:52:12","","4","2322","<p>I have a problem with maintaining state in an ASP.NET AJAX page. Short version: I need some way to update the page ViewState after an async callback has been made, to reflect any state changes the server made during the async call. </p>

<p>This seems to be a common problem, but I will describe my scenario to help explain:</p>

<p>I have a grid-like control which has some JavaScript enhancements - namely, the ability to drag and drop columns and rows. When a column or row is dropped into a new position, an AJAX method is invoked to notify the control server-side and fire a corresponding server-side event (""OnColumnMoved"" or ""OnRowMoved"").</p>

<p>ASP.NET AJAX calls, by default, send the entire page as the request. That way the page goes through a complete lifecycle, viewstate is persisted and the state of the control is restored before the RaiseCallbackEvent method is invoked.</p>

<p>However, since the AJAX call does not update the page, the ViewState reflects the <em>original</em> state of the control, even after the column or row has been moved. So the second time a client-side action occurs, the AJAX request goes to the server and the page &amp; control are built back up again to reflect the <em>first</em> state of the control, not the state after the first column or row was moved.</p>

<p>This problem extends to many implications. For example if we have a client-side/AJAX action to add a new item to the grid, and then a row is dragged, the grid is built server-side with one less item than on the client-side.</p>

<p>And finally &amp; most seriously for my specific example, the actual data source object we are acting upon is stored in the page ViewState. That was a design decision to allow keeping a stateful copy of the manipulated data which can either be committed to DB after many manipulations or discarded if the user backs out. That is very difficult to change.</p>

<p>So, again, I need a way for the page ViewState to be updated on callback after the AJAX method is fired.</p>

<p><strong>The Problem:</strong><br />
When using IE6 (which the entire user-base uses), the response sent back from the server is a 404 error. </p>

<p><strong>Observations:</strong><br />
The program works fine in Firefox.<br />
The calling procedure cannot target any procedures within the same package.<br />
The calling procedure can target outside sites (both http, https).<br />
The other AJAX calls in the package that are not posts of form data work fine.<br />
I've searched the <em>internets</em> and consulted with senior-skilled team members and haven't discovered anything that satisfactorily addresses the issue.<br />
*Tried <a href=""http://dojotoolkit.org/forum/dojo-core-dojo-0-9/dojo-core-support/xhrpost-firefox-fine-ie-not-so-much"" rel=""nofollow"">Q&amp;A</a> over at Dojo support forums.      </p>

<p><strong>The Questions:</strong><br />
What troubleshooting techniques do you recommend?<br />
What troubleshooting tools do you recommend for HTTPS analyzing?<br />
Any hypotheses on what the issue might be?<br />
Any ideas for workarounds that aren't total (bad) hacks?</p>

lomaxx, thx for the <a href=""http://www.orafaq.com/wiki/PL/SQL_FAQ"" rel=""nofollow"">fiddler</a> tip. you have no idea how awesome it was to get that and use it as a debugging tool. after starting it up this is what i found and how i fixed it (at least in the short term):</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>After seeing that message from the server, I kicked around Fiddler a bit more to see what else I could learn from it. Found that there's a WebForms tab that shows the values in the web form. Wouldn't you know it, the ""xxx_DISPLAYED_"" fields above were in it. </p>

<p>I don't really understand yet why these fields exist, because I didn't create them explicitly in the web PLSQL code. But I do understand now that the target procedure has to include them as parameters to work correctly. Again, this is only in the case of IE6 for me, as Firefox worked fine.</p>

<p>Well, that the short term answer and hack to fix it. Hopefully, a little more work in this area will lead to a better understanding of the fundamentals going on here. </p>

<ul>
<li>I don't need to do any DOM updates before, after, or during the callbacks. </li>
<li>I don't need any information from the page, just from a site cookie which should always be sent with requests anyway, and an ID value.</li>
</ul>

<p>What I'm curious to find out, is if there is any clean and simple way to make a JavaScript Ajax callback to an ASP.NET page without posting back the rest of the information on the page. I'd like to not have to do this if it is possible.</p>

<p>I really just want to be able to call a single method on the page, nothing else.</p>

<p>Also, I'm restricted to ASP.NET 2.0 so I can't use any of the new 3.5 framework ASP AJAX features, although I can use the ASP AJAX extensions for the 2.0 framework.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong><br />
I've decided to accept <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27258/aspnet-javascript-callbacks-without-full-postbacks#27270"" rel=""nofollow"">DanP</a>'s answer as it seems to be exactly what I'm looking for. Our site already uses jQuery for some things so I'll probably use jQuery for making requests since in my experience it seems to perform much better than ASP's AJAX framework does. </p>

<p>What do you think would be the best method of transferring data to the IHttpHandler? Should I add variables to the query string or POST the data I need to send?</p>

<p>The only thing I think I have to send is a single ID, but I can't decide what the best method is to send the ID and have the IHttpHandler handle it. I'd like to come up with a solution that would prevent a person with basic computer skills from accidentally or intentionally accessing the page directly or repeating requests. Is this possible?</p>

<p><em>Edit:</em> Microsoft created a way to prevent XSS attacks by disallowing JavaScript access to cookies if HttpOnly is specified. FireFox later adopted this. So my question is: If you are using AJAX on a site, like StackOverflow, are Http-Only cookies an option?</p>

<p><em>Edit 2:</em> Question 2. If the purpose of HttpOnly is to prevent JavaScript access to cookies, and you can still retrieve the cookies via JavaScript through the XmlHttpRequest Object, <strong>what is the point of HttpOnly</strong>?</p>

<p><em>Edit 3:</em> Here is a quote from Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When the browser receives such a cookie, it is supposed to use it as usual in the following HTTP exchanges, but not to make it visible to client-side scripts.[32] The <code>HttpOnly</code> flag is not part of any standard, and is not implemented in all browsers. Note that there is currently no prevention of reading or writing the session cookie via a XMLHTTPRequest. [33].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand that <code>document.cookie</code> is blocked when you use HttpOnly. But it seems that you can still read cookie values in the XMLHttpRequest object, allowing for XSS. How does HttpOnly make you any safer than? By making cookies essentially read only? </p>

<p>In your example, I cannot write to your <code>document.cookie</code>, but I can still steal your cookie and post it to my domain using the XMLHttpRequest object.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
    var req = null;
    try { req = new XMLHttpRequest(); } catch(e) {}
    if (!req) try { req = new ActiveXObject(""Msxml2.XMLHTTP""); } catch(e) {}
    if (!req) try { req = new ActiveXObject(""Microsoft.XMLHTTP""); } catch(e) {}
    req.open('GET', 'http://stackoverflow.com/', false);
    req.send(null);
    alert(req.getAllResponseHeaders());
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><em>Edit 4:</em> Sorry, I meant that you could send the XMLHttpRequest to the StackOverflow domain, and then save the result of getAllResponseHeaders() to a string, regex out the cookie, and then post that to an external domain. It appears that Wikipedia and ha.ckers concur with me on this one, but I would love be re-educated...</p>

<p><em>Final Edit:</em> Ahh, apparently both sites are wrong, this is actually a <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=380418"">bug in FireFox</a>. IE6 &amp; 7 are actually the only browsers that currently fully support HttpOnly.</p>

<p>To reiterate everything I've learned:</p>

<ul>
<li>HttpOnly restricts all access to document.cookie in IE7 &amp; and FireFox (not sure about other browsers)</li>
<li>HttpOnly removes cookie information from the response headers in XMLHttpObject.getAllResponseHeaders() in IE7.</li>
<li>XMLHttpObjects may only be submitted to the domain they originated from, so there is no cross-domain posting of the cookies.</li>
</ul>

This is an example of what a call might look like:</p>

<pre><code>$.ajax({
    url: ""userCreation.ashx"",
    data: { u:userName, p:password, e:email },
    type: ""POST"",
    beforeSend: function(){disableSubmitButton();},
    complete: function(){enableSubmitButton();},
    error: function(xhr, statusText, errorThrown){
            // Work out what the error was and display the appropriate message
        },
    success: function(data){
            displayUserCreatedMessage();
            refreshUserList();
        }
});
</code></pre>

<p>The request might fail for a number of reasons, such as duplicate user name, duplicate email address etc, and the ashx is written to throw an exception when this happens.</p>

<p>My problem seems to be that by throwing an exception the ashx causes the statusText and errorThrown to be undefined. I can get to the XMLHttpRequest.responseText which contains the HTML that makes up the standard .net error page.</p>

<p>I am finding the page title in the responseText and using the title to work out which error was thrown. Although I have a suspicion that this will fall apart when I enable custom error handling pages.</p>

<p>Should I be throwing the errors in the ashx, or should I be returning a status code as part of the data returned by the call to userCreation.ashx, then using this to decide what action to take? How do you handle these situations?</p>

I am developing a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Struts"" rel=""nofollow"">Struts</a> web application which runs in a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Tomcat"" rel=""nofollow"">Tomcat</a> server. This is the environment I set up to work with UTF-8:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I have added the attributes <code>URIEncoding=""UTF-8"" useBodyEncodingForURI=""true""</code> into the <code>Connector</code> tag to Tomcat's <code>conf/server.xml</code> file.</p></li>
<li><p>I have a <code>utf-8_general_ci</code> database</p></li>
<li><p>I am using the next filter to ensure my request and responses are encoded in UTF-8</p>

<pre><code>package filters;

import java.io.IOException;
import javax.servlet.*;

public class UTF8Filter implements Filter {
    public void destroy() {}

    public void doFilter(ServletRequest request,ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain)
        throws IOException, ServletException {
        request.setCharacterEncoding(""UTF-8"");
        response.setContentType(""text/html;charset=UTF-8"");
        chain.doFilter(request, response);
    }

    public void init(FilterConfig filterConfig) throws ServletException {
    }
}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>I use this filter in WEB-INF/web.xml</p></li>
<li><p>I am using the next code for my JSON responses:</p>

<pre><code>public static void populateWithJSON(HttpServletResponse response,JSONObject json)
{
   String CONTENT_TYPE=""text/x-json;charset=UTF-8"";
   response.setContentType(CONTENT_TYPE);
   response.setHeader(""Cache-Control"", ""no-cache"");
   try {
        response.getWriter().write(json.toString());
   } catch (IOException e) {
    throw new ApplicationException(""Application Exception raised in RetrievedStories"", e);
   }
}
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>Everything seems to work fine (content coming from the database is displayed properly, and I am able to submit forms which are stored in UTF-8 in the database). The problem is that I am <strong>not able to submit forms with Ajax</strong>. I use jQuery, and I thought the problem was the lack of contentType field in the Ajax request. But I was wrong. I have a really simple form to submit comments which contains of an id and a body. The body field can be in different languages such as Spanish, German, or whatever.</p>

<p>If I submit my form with body textarea containing <code>contraseña</code>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firebug_%28software%29"" rel=""nofollow"">Firebug</a> shows me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>Request Headers</h3>
  
  <ul>
  <li><em><strong>Host</em></strong>  localhost:8080</li>
  <li><em><strong>Accept-Charset</em></strong> ISO-8859-1, utf-8;q=0.7;*q=0.7</li>
  <li><em><strong>Content-Type</em></strong> application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset UTF-8</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>If I execute <em>Copy Location with parameters</em> in Firebug, the encoding seems already wrong:</p>

<pre><code>http://localhost:8080/Cerepedia/corporate/postStoryComment.do?&amp;body=contrase%C3%B1a&amp;id=88
</code></pre>

<p>This is my jQuery code:</p>

<pre><code>function addComment() {
    var comment_body = $(""#postCommentForm textarea"").val();
    var item_id = $(""#postCommentForm input:hidden"").val();
    var url = rooturl+""corporate/postStoryComment.do?"";
    $.post(url, { id:  item_id, body: comment_body } ,
        function(data){
        /* Do stuff with the answer */
    }, ""json"");  }
</code></pre>

<p>A submission of a form with jQuery is causing the next error server side (note I am using <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibernate_%28Java%29"" rel=""nofollow"">Hibernate</a>).</p>

<p>The pages I am working with are the search interface for a site.  You enter terms in a normal search box, click ""go and wind up at a search results page.  On the search results page there are a ton of UI controls for filtering/sorting the search results to find what you are looking for.  Some of the operations triggered by these controls may take a (relatively) long time to complete (e.g. several seconds).</p>

<p>This latency is fine in case where the user is initially filtering/sorting their results... there's a nice AJAX spinner and so on... however when the user clicks on a search result and then clicks on the BACK button, I would like the page to instantly be restored to the state it was in when they clicked through.  </p>

<p>I can restore the states using IFRAMEs/fragment identifiers as a dictionary of page history, but what ends up happening is that when the user first hits the back button the initial page is loaded, then it (re) makes the AJAX query to get the page state back, which triggers the AJAX spinner and another wait of possible several seconds.</p>

<p>Is there any approach that does not require this kind of two-stage load of the page when the user returns to the page via the BACK button?</p>

<p>Edited to add: I am partial to jquery but I'd be happy with solutions that depend on other libraries/toolkits or that are standalone/raw javascript.</p>

<p>Edited to add: I should've added that I'm trying to avoid cookies/sessions because this prevents people having multiple brower windows/tabs open and manipulating different sets of search results at the same time.</p>

<p>Edit: Matt, can you elaborate on your proposed solution (triggering a page change event via fragment identifer)? I see how this would help with BACK button clicks across the same page but not coming BACK to the search results page after clicking on a specific result.</p>

I'm calling the library using the HTML Bridge that is part of Silverlight 2. Silverlight got great support for passing types between JavaScript and Managed Code, but now I've bumped against a problem.</p>

<p>Microsoft ASP.NET AJAX Client Libraries includes a ""type system"", and one of the things the framework does is validating that the parameters is of correct type. The specific function I'm calling is the Sys.Application.addHistoryPoint, and the validation code looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>var e = Function.validateParams(arguments, [
    {name: ""state"", type: Object},
    {name: ""title"", type: String, mayBeNull: true, optional: true}
]);
</code></pre>

<p>I've tried passing all kinds of CLR types as the state parameter (C# structs, [ScriptableTypes], Dictionary types etc. And every time I get the error: ""Sys.ArgumentTypeException: Object of type 'Function' cannot be converted to type 'Object'.</p>

<p>This error is obviously coming from the parameter validation... But WHY does ASP.NET AJAX think my types are Functions? Does anyone understand the type validation in MS AJAX?</p>

<p>I know I can do workarounds like calling HtmlPage.Window.Eval(""..."") and pass my JS integration as strings, but I don't want to do that. I want to pass a real .NET type as the state parameter.</p>

It seems that using <code>innerHTML</code> to write <code>document.write</code> statements is taking it a step too far, but I cannot find any clue in the javascript implementations (FF2&amp;3, IE6&amp;7) of this behavior.</p>

   {
      // we want to set a cookie
      Response.Cookies.Add(new HttpCookie(""MyCookie"", ""true""));

<p>That handler will run during Ajax requests (as a result of the Ajax framework I am using), as well as at other times - the condition of the if statement filters out non-Ajax events, and works just fine (it isn't relevant here, so I didn't include it for brevity's sake).</p>

<p>It suffices us to say that this works just fine - the cookie is set, I am able to read it on the client, and all is well up to that point.</p>

<p>Now for the part that drives me nuts.</p>

<p>Here is the JavaScript function I am using to delete the cookie:</p>

<pre><code>function deleteCookie(name) {
   var cookieDate = new Date();
   cookieDate.setTime(cookieDate.getTime() - 1);
   document.cookie = (name + ""=; expires="" + cookieDate.toGMTString());
}

<p>So, of course, at some point after the cookie is set, I delete it like so:</p>

<pre><code>deleteCookie(""MyCookie"");

In all other browsers aside from Firefox (IE6/7, Opera, Safari), my append call actually appends the information below my existing option - ""Select An "". But in Firefox, it automatically selects the last item given to the select control, regardless of whether I specify the JQuery action to .append or to replace (.html()). </p>
