<p>Edit:  I agree that this example is very table-like and an actual table would be a fine choice.  But my ""real"" page will eventually be less table-like, and I'd just like to first master this task!</p>

<p>Also, for some reason, when I create/edit my posts in IE7, the code shows up correctly in the preview view, but when I actually post the message, the formatting gets removed.  Editing my post in Firefox 2 seems to have worked, FWIW.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<hr>

<p>@Chris</p>

<p>A good point, but there are reasons I want it to resize, I want the area it takes up to be the area of the information contained in it.  As you can see in the screen shot, if I have a fixed textarea, it takes up a fair wack of vertical space.</p>

<p>I can reduce the font, but I need address to be large and readable.  Now I can reduce the size of the text area, but then I have problems with people who have an address line that takes 3 or 4 (one takes 5) lines.  Needing to have the user use a scrollbar is a major no-no.</p>

<p>I guess I should be a bit more specific, I'm after vertical resizing, the width doesn't matter as much.  The only problem that happens with that, is the ISO number (the large ""1"") gets pushed under the address when the window width is too small (as you can see on the screenshot).</p>

<p>It's not about having a gimick, it's about having a text field the user can edit that won't take up unnecessary space, but will show all the text in it.</p>

<p>Though if someone comes up with another way to approach the problem I'm open to that too.</p>

<hr>

<p>@Orion</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I've modified the code a little because it was acting a little odd, I changed it to activate on keyup, because it wouldn't take into consideration the character that was just typed.</p>

  var str = $( 'iso_address' ).value;
  var cols = $( 'iso_address' ).cols;
  var linecount = 0;
  $A( str.split( ""\n"" ) ).each( function( l ) {
    linecount += 1 + Math.floor( l.length / cols ); // take into account long lines
  } )

<p>I already saw people hiding selects when opening a popup div, that leads to pretty bad user experience having controls disappearing.</p>

<p>FogBugz actually had a pretty smart solution (before v6) of turning every select into text boxes when a popup was displayed. This solved the bug and tricked the user eye but the behavior was not perfect.</p>

<p>Another solution is in FogBugz 6 where they no more use the select element and recoded it everywhere.</p>

<p>Last solution I currently use is messing up the IE rendering engine and force it to render the absolutely positioned <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> as an ActiveX element too, ensuring it can live over a select element. This is achieved by placing an invisible <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> inside the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and styling it with:</p>

<pre class=""lang-css prettyprint-override""><code>#MyDiv iframe
{
    position: absolute;
    z-index: -1;

    border: 0;

<p>I have a table with a margin-bottom of 19px. Below that I have a form that contains some fieldsets. One of them is floated right. The problem is that the margin-bottom is not getting the full 19px in IE7. I've gone through all of the IE7 css/margin/float bugs that I can think of and have tried remedies but have been unsuccessful.

<ol>
<li>Wrapping the form or fieldset in an unstyled div. No apparent change.</li>
<li>Nixing the margin-bottom on the table and instead wrapping that with a div and giving it a padding-bottom of 19px. No apparent change.</li>
<li>Nixing the margin-bottom on the table and adding a div with a fixed height of 19px. No apparent change.</li>
<li>Putting a clear between the table and the fieldset.</li>

<p>I thought I'd try to accomplish it using javascript and not CSS in an effort to keep the requests for image files to a minimum (yes, I know that it's possible to combine all required rounded corner shapes into one image) and I also wanted to be able to change the background color pretty much on the fly.</p>

<p>I already utilize jQuery so I looked at the excellent <a href=""http://plugins.jquery.com/project/corners"">rounded corners plugin</a> and it worked like a charm in every browser I tried. Being a developer however I noticed the opportunity to make it a bit more efficient. The script already includes code for detecting if the current browser supports webkit rounded corners (safari based browsers). If so it uses raw CSS instead of creating layers of divs.</p>

<p>I thought that it would be awesome if the same kind of check could be performed to see if the browser supports the Gecko-specific -moz-border-radius-* properties and if so utilize them.</p>

<p>The check for webkit support looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>var webkitAvailable = false;  
try {  
    webkitAvailable = (document.defaultView.getComputedStyle(this[0], null)['-webkit-border-radius'] != undefined);
} 
catch(err) {}
</code></pre>

<p>That, however, did not work for -moz-border-radius so I started checking for alternatives.</p>

<p>My fallback solution is of course to use browser detection but that's far from recommended practice ofcourse.</p>

<p>My best solution yet is as follows.</p>

<pre><code>var mozborderAvailable = false;
try {
    var o = jQuery('&lt;div&gt;').css('-moz-border-radius', '1px');
    mozborderAvailable = $(o).css('-moz-border-radius-topleft') == '1px';
    o = null;
} catch(err) {}
</code></pre>

<p>It's based on the theory that Gecko ""expands"" the composite -moz-border-radius to the four ""subproperties"" -moz-border-radius-{topleft,topright,bottomleft,bottomright}</p>

<p>Is there any javascript/CSS guru out there that have a better solution?</p>

<p>I know for sure there are the obvious cons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wide columns of text are hard to read</li>
<li>Writing html/css using percents can be a pain</li>
<li>It makes you vulnerable to having your design stretched past it's limits if an image is too wide, or a block of text is added that is too long. (see it's a pain to code the html/css)</li>
</ul>

<p>The only Pro I can think of is that users who use the font-resizing that is built into their browser won't have to deal with columns that are only a few words long, with a body of whitespace on either side. However, I think that may be a browser problem more than anything else (Firefox 3 allows you to zoom <strong>everything</strong> instead of just the text, which comes in handy all the time)</p>

    &lt;div id=""column""&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

<p>With some styling I have an image that is split between the column and the content but needs to maintain the same vertical positioning so that it lines up.</p>

<p>Styling is similar to this:</p>

<pre><code>#column 
{
    width:150px;
    height:450px;
    left:-150px;
    bottom:-140px;
    background:url(../images/image.png) no-repeat;

#container 
{

   position:relative;
   width:100px;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This works great when content in #content is dynamically loaded before rendering.  This also works great in firefox always.  However, in IE6 and IE7 if I use javascript to change the content (and thus height) of #content, the images no longer line up (#column doesn't move). If I use IE Developer Bar to just update the div (say add position:absolute manually) the image jumps down and lines up again.</p>

<p>Is there something I am missing here?</p>

<p>@Ricky - Hmm, that means in this case there is no solution I think.  At its best there will be a jaggedy matchup afterwards but as my content expands and contracts etc. hiding/showing doesn't work out to be practical.  Still thanks for answering with the best solution.</p>

<p>Thanks for the explanation. The float:left works beautifully with expected results in FF 3.1. Unfortunately, in IE6 the right side span renders 50% of the 50%, in effect giving it a width of 25% of the browser window. Setting its width to 100% achieves the desired results but breaks in FF 3.1 which is in standards compliance mode and I understand that. Getting it to work both in FF and IE 6, without resorting to hacks or using multiple CSS sheets has been a challenge</p>
