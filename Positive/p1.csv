My <code>contracts</code> table consists of some standard contract information, with a column for the <code>primary department</code>. This column is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_key"">foreign key</a> to my <code>Departments</code> table, where I store the basic <code>department name</code>, <code>id</code>, <code>notes</code>. This is all setup and functioning in my <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SQL_Server"">SQL Server</a>.</p>

<p>When I use the XSD tool, I can drag both tables in at once and it auto detects/creates the foreign key I have between these two tables. This works great when I'm on my main page and am viewing contract data.</p>

<p>However, when I go to my administrative page to modify the department data. I typically do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Dim dtDepartment As New DepartmentDataTable()
Dim taDepartment As New DepartmentTableAdapter()

taDepartment.Fill(dtDepartment)
</code></pre>

<p>However, at this point an exception is thrown saying to the effect that there is a foreign key reference broken here, I'm guessing since I don't have the <code>Contract</code> <code>DataTable</code> filled. </p>

<p>How can I fix this problem? I know I can simply remove the foreign key from the XSD to make things work fine, but having the additional integrity check there and having the XSD schema match the SQL schema in the database is nice.</p>

<p>Another approach: if the string contains 2 different non-numeric characters, use the last one as the decimal separator and discard the others.

Additionally, it is easier to create and manage smaller DataContext files than one big one. The thing that I would lose is that there would be some distant sections of the database that would not be navigable through LinqToSql (even though a chain of relationships connects them in the actual database). Additionally, there would be some table classes that would exist in more than one DataContext.</p>

<li><strong><em>Serialization/De-serialization</em></strong>. In my current solution, I simply tell the tool <strong>not</strong> to obfuscate any class data members because the pain of not being able to load data which was previously serialized is simply too big.</li>
<li><strong><em>Integration with Build Process</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>Working with ASP.NET</em></strong>. In the past, I have found this problematic due to changing .dll names (you often have one per page) - which not all tools handle well.</li>

<p>I understand that in .NET it is essential to dispose of any instances of objects that implement the <code>IDisposable</code> interface to release some resources although the object can still be something after it is disposed (hence the <code>isDisposed</code> property in forms), so I assume it can still reside in memory or at least in part?</p>

<p>I also know that when an object goes out of scope it is then marked for collection ready for the next pass of the garbage collector (although this may take time).</p>

<p>So with this in mind will setting it to <code>null</code> speed up the system releasing the memory as it does not have to work out that it is no longer in scope and are they any bad side effects?</p>

"2872","1","2901","","2008-08-05 21:19:37","","10","860","<p><strong>My Goal</strong></p>

<p>I would like to have a main processing thread (non GUI), and be able to spin off GUIs in their own background threads as needed, and having my main non GUI thread keep working. Put another way, I want my main non GUI-thread to be the owner of the GUI-thread and not vice versa. I'm not sure this is even possible with Windows Forms(?)</p>

<p>(Sorry for the big post here. I've had complaints about previous shorter versions of this question just isn't comprehensible. I'm a lousy writer)</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>I have a component based system in which a controller dynamically load assemblies and instantiates and run classes implementing a common <em>IComponent</em> interface with a single method <em>DoStuff()</em> .</p>

<p>Which components that gets loaded is configured via a xml configuration file and by adding new assemblies containing different implementations of <em>IComponent</em> . The components provides utility functions to the main application. While the main program is doing it's thing, e.g. controlling a nuclear plant, the components might be performing utility tasks (in their own threads), e.g. cleaning the database, sending emails, printing funny jokes on the printer, what have you. What I would like, is to have one of these components be able to display a GUI, e.g. with status information for the said email sending component.</p>

<p>The lifetime of the complete system looks like this</p>

<ol>
<li>Application starts.</li>
<li>Check configuration file for components to load. Load them.</li>
<li><strong>For each component, run DoStuff() to initialize it and make it live its own life in their own threads.</strong></li>
<li>Continue to do main application-thingy king of work, forever.</li>
</ol>

<p>I have not yet been able to successfully perform point 3 if the component fires up a GUI in <em>DoStuff()</em> . It simply just halts until the GUI is closed. And not until the GUI is closed does the program progress to point 4.</p>

<p>It would be great if these components were allowed to start up their own Windows Forms GUIs.</p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>

<p>When a component tries to fire up a GUI in <em>DoStuff()</em> (the exact line of code is when the component runs Application.Run(theForm)) , the component and hence our system ""hangs"" at the Application.Run() line until the GUI is closed. Well, the just fired up GUI works fine, as expected.</p>

<p>Example of components. One hasn't nothing to do with GUI, whilst the second fires up a cute windows with pink fluffy bunnies in them.</p>

<pre><code>public class MyComponent1: IComponent<br>{<br>    public string DoStuff(...) { // write something to the database  }<br>}<br><br>public class MyComponent2: IComponent<br>    public void DoStuff()<br>    {<br>        Application.EnableVisualStyles();<br>        Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false);<br>        Application.Run(new Form());<br><br>        // I want the thread to immediately return after the GUI <br>        // is fired up, so that my main thread can continue to work.<br>    }<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>I have tried this with no luck. Even when I try to fire up the GUI in it's own thread, the execution halts until the GUI as closed.</p>

<pre><code>    public void DoStuff()<br>    {<br>           new Thread(ThreadedInitialize).Start()<br>    }<br><br>    private void ThreadedInitialize()<br>    {<br>        Application.EnableVisualStyles();<br>        Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false);<br>        Application.Run(new Form());<br>    }<br></code></pre>

I am using the .net <code>HttpListener</code> class, but I'm won't be running on IIS and am not using ASP.net.  This <a href=""http://www.leastprivilege.com/CommentView.aspx?guid=0c34094a-bdd4-4041-be6e-919f10fe1d31"">web site</a> describes what code to actual use to implement SSL with asp.net and <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/adarshk/archive/2004/11/10/255467.aspx"">this site</a> describes how to set up the certificates (although I'm not sure if it works only for IIS or not).  </p>

<p>When I the class documentation, it describes various types of authentication (basic, digest, Windows, etc.) - none of them refer to SSL.  It does say that if <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.httplistener.aspx"">HTTPS is used, you will need to set a server certificate</a>.  Is this going to be a one line property setting and <code>HttpListener</code> figures out the rest?  </p>

<p>In short, I need to know how to set up the certificates and how to modify the code to implement SSL.</p>

<p>Although it doesn't occur when I'm trying to access HTTPS, I did notice an error in my System Event log - the source is ""Schannel"" and the content of the message is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A fatal error occurred when attempting
  to access the SSL server credential
  private key. The error code returned
  from the cryptographic module is
  0x80090016.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Edit:<br>
<strong>Steps taken so far</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Created a working HTTPListener in C# that works for HTTP connections (e.g. ""http://localhost:8089/foldername/""</li>
<li>Created a certificate using makecert.exe</li>
<li>Added the certificate to be trusted using certmgr.exe</li>
<li>Used Httpcfg.exe to listen for SSL connections on a test port (e.g. 8090)</li>
<li>Added port 8080 to the HTTPListener via listener.Prefixes.Add(https://localhost:8090/foldername/"");</li>
<li>tested an HTTP client connection, e.g. (http://localhost:8089/foldername/"") in a browser and receive correct return</li>
<li>tested an HTTPS client connection, e.g. (http://localhost:8090/foldername/"") in a browser and receive ""Data Transfer Interrupted"" (in Firefox)</li>
<li>debugging in visual studio shows that the listener callback that receives the requests never gets hit when the HTTPS connection starts - I don't see any place that I could set a breakpoint to catch anything else earlier.</li>
<li>netstat shows that listening ports are open for both HTTPS and HTTP.  the HTTPS port does go to TIME_WAIT after a connection is attempted.</li>
<li><strong><a href=""http://www.fiddlertool.com/fiddler/"">Fiddler</a> and <a href=""http://www.ieinspector.com/httpanalyzer/"">HTTPAnalyzer</a> don't catch any of the traffic, I guess it doesn't get far enough in the process to show up in those HTTP analysis tools</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>What could the problem be? </li>
<li>Is there a piece of .Net code I am missing (meaning I have to do more in C# other than simply add a prefix to the listener that points to HTTPS, which is what i have done)</li>
<li>Have a missed a configuration step somewhere? </li>
<li>What else might I do to analyze the problem?</li>
<li>Is the error message in the System Event log a sign of the problem?  If so how would it be fixed?</li>

As the user changes settings using the app's UI (clicking checkboxes, choosing radio buttons, etc.), I plan to be writing those changes out to the AppSettings. At the same time, while the program is running I plan to be accessing the AppSettings constantly from a process that will be constantly processing data. Changes to settings via the UI need to affect the data processing in real-time, which is why the process will be accessing the AppSettings constantly.</p>

<p>Is this a good idea with regard to performance? Using AppSettings is supposed to be ""the right way"" to store and access configuration settings when writing .Net apps, but I worry that this method wasn't intended for a constant load (at least in terms of settings being constantly read).</p>

<p>If anyone has experience with this, I would greatly appreciate the input.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I should probably clarify a few points.</p>

<p>This is not a web application, so connecting a database to the application might be overkill simply for storing configuration settings. This is a Windows Forms application.</p>

<p>According to the MSDN documention, the ConfigurationManager is for storing not just application level settings, but user settings as well. (Especially important if, for instance, the application is installed as a partial-trust application.)</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> I accepted lomaxx's answer because Properties does indeed look like a good solution, without having to add any additional layers to my application (such as a database). When using Properties, it already does all the caching that others suggested. This means any changes and subsequent reads are all done in memory, making it extremely fast. Properties only writes the changes to disk when you explicitly tell it to. This means I can make changes to the config settings on-the-fly at run time and then only do a final save out to disk when the program exits.</p>

<p>Just to verify it would actually be able to handle the load I need, I did some testing on my laptop and was able to do 750,000 reads and 7,500 writes per second using Properties. That is so far above and beyond what my application will <em>ever</em> even come close to needing that I feel quite safe in using Properties without impacting performance.</p>

        using (mockery.Record())
        {
            Expect.Call(zoo.Animals)

                .Repeat.Once();

        using (mockery.Playback())
        {
            zoo.CageThe(mockLion);
            zoo.CageThe(mockRhino);

            Assert.AreEqual(mockResults, new List&lt;IAnimal&gt;(zoo.Animals));
        }       
    }
}


public class Zoo : IZoo
{
    private IList&lt;IAnimal&gt; animals = new List&lt;IAnimal&gt;();

    public void CageThe(IAnimal animal)
    {
        animals.Add(animal);
    }

    public IEnumerable&lt;IAnimal&gt; Animals
    {
        get
        {
            foreach(IAnimal animal in animals)
            {
                yield return animal;

    IEnumerable&lt;IAnimal&gt; Animals { get;}
    void CageThe(IAnimal animal);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I don't like how I got it to work for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Consuming the <code>IEnumerable&lt;IAnimal&gt;</code> results into <code>IList&lt;IAnimal&gt;</code> - because I understand this puts the results to check onto the heap.</li>
<li>Setting up the contents of the results - <strong>which I understand as well; but my main point is to test that <code>Zoo.Animals</code> is returning <code>IEnumerable&lt;IAnimal&gt;</code>, and even better, that it is using <code>yield return</code> inside.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Any suggestions on doing this better or simpler?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I'm trying to determine the optimal way to test the interaction between <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> and whatever I'm using.  I'm not trying to test that <code>Zoo</code> can hold animals, rather that <code>Zoo</code> exposes as <code>IEnumerable&lt;IAnimal&gt;</code>, and that <code>yield return</code> is getting used as well.</p>
