<p>I know that from outside of the object you should use a getter/setter, but from within would you just do:</p>

<p>Java:</p>

<pre><code>String property = this.property;
</code></pre>

<p>PHP:</p>

<pre><code>$property = $this-&gt;property;

<pre><code>$property = $this-&gt;getProperty();
</code></pre>

<p>Forgive me if my Java is a little off, it's been a year since I programmed in Java...</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>It seems people are assuming I am talking about private or protected variables/properties only. When I learned OO I was taught to use getters/setters for every single property even if it was public (and actually I was told never to make any variable/property public). So, I may be starting off from a false assumption from the get go. It appears that people answering this question are maybe saying that you should have public properties and that those don't need getters and setters, which goes against what I was taught, and what I was talking about, although maybe that needs to be discussed as well. That's probably a good topic for a different question though...</p>

<p>Now, I use those objects in both <code>script.php</code> and <code>/soap/soap.php</code>, I could move them, but I want the directory structure like that for a specific reason. When executing <code>script.php</code> the include path is <code>inc/include.php</code> and when executing <code>/soap/soap.php</code> it's <code>../inc</code>, absolute paths work, <code>/mnt/webdev/[project name]/inc/include1.php...</code> But it's an ugly solution if I ever want to move the directory to a different location.</p>

<p>So is there a way to use relative paths, or a way to programically generate the <code>""/mnt/webdev/[project name]/""</code>?</p>

<p>Final Solution:</p>

<p>I never was able to solve the problem, however what I wound up doing was switching to MySQL and using a transactional level query here. This was not the main or even a primary reason to switch. I had been having problems with SQL Server and it allowed me to have our CMS and various other tools all running on the same database. Previous we had a SQL Server and a MySQL database running to run our site. The port was a bit on the time consuming however in the long run I feel it will work much better for the site and the business.</p>

Before the doubters and dreamers cry out ""how on earth?"", relax -- I haven't found a way to make late static binding work -- I'm just working around it in the best way that I possibly can.</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm not currently using prepared statements for querying, because I couldn't come up with a way to pass a variable number of arguments to the <code>bind_params()</code> or <code>bind_result()</code> methods. </p>

<p>Why do I need to support a variable number of arguments, you ask? Because the superclass of my models (think of my solution as a hacked-up PHP ActiveRecord wannabe) is where the querying is defined, and so the find() method, for example, doesn't know how many parameters it would need to bind.</p>

<p>Now, I've already thought of building an argument list and passing a string to eval(), but I don't like that solution very much -- I'd rather just implement my own security checks and pass on statements.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any suggestions (or success stories) about how to get this done? If you can help me solve this first problem, perhaps we can tackle binding the result set (something I suspect will be more difficult, or at least more resource-intensive if it involves an initial query to determine table structure).</p>

<p>I'm currently using the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GD_Graphics_Library"">GD</a> function imagecopyresampled to take high resolution images, and cleanly resize them down to a size for web viewing (roughly 700 pixels wide by 700 pixels tall).</p>

<p>This works great on small (under 2 MB) photos and the entire resize operation takes less than a second on the server. However, the site will eventually service photographers who may be uploading images up to 10 MB in size (or images up to 5000x4000 pixels in size).</p>

<p>Doing this kind of resize operation with large images tends to increase the memory usage by a very large margin (larger images can spike the memory usage for the script past 80 MB). Is there any way to make this resize operation more efficient? Should I be using an alternate image library such as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ImageMagick"">ImageMagick</a>?</p>

<p>Right now, the resize code looks something like this</p>

<pre><code>function makeThumbnail($sourcefile, $endfile, $thumbwidth, $thumbheight, $quality){
// Takes the sourcefile (path/to/image.jpg) and makes a thumbnail from it
// and places it at endfile (path/to/thumb.jpg).

// Load image and get image size.
$img = imagecreatefromjpeg($sourcefile);
$width = imagesx( $img );
$height = imagesy( $img );

if ($width &gt; $height) {
    $newwidth = $thumbwidth;
    $divisor = $width / $thumbwidth;
    $newheight = floor( $height / $divisor);
}
else {
    $newheight = $thumbheight;
    $divisor = $height / $thumbheight;
    $newwidth = floor( $width / $divisor );
}

// Create a new temporary image.
$tmpimg = imagecreatetruecolor( $newwidth, $newheight );

// Copy and resize old image into new image.
imagecopyresampled( $tmpimg, $img, 0, 0, 0, 0, $newwidth, $newheight, $width, $height );

// Save thumbnail into a file.
imagejpeg( $tmpimg, $endfile, $quality);

// release the memory
imagedestroy($tmpimg);
imagedestroy($img);

<p>I'm writing a small display to show customers what days they can water their lawns based on their watering group (ABCDE) and what time of year it is.  Our seasons look like this:
Summer (5-1 to 8-31) 
Spring  (3-1 to 4-30) 
Fall (9-1 to 10-31)
Winter (11-1 to 2-28) </p>

<p>An example might be:</p>

<p>If I'm in group A, here would be my allowed times:
Winter: Mondays only
Spring: Tues, Thurs, Sat
Summer: Any Day
Fall: Tues, Thurs, Sat</p>

<p>If I was writing this in PHP I would use arrays like this:</p>

<pre><code>//M=Monday,t=Tuesday,T=Thursday.... etc
$schedule[""A""][""Winter""]='M';
$schedule[""A""][""Spring""]='tTS';
$schedule[""A""][""Summer""]='Any';
$schedule[""A""][""Fall""]='tTS';
$schedule[""B""][""Winter""]='t';
</code></pre>

<p>I COULD make the days arrays (array(""Tuesday"",""Thursday"",""Saturday"")) etc, but it is not necessary for what I'm really trying to accomplish.</p>

<p>I will also need to setup arrays to determine what season I'm in:</p>

<pre><code>$seasons[""Summer""][""start""]=0501;
$seasons[""Summer""][""end""]=0801;
</code></pre>

<p>Can anyone suggest a really cool way to do this? I will have today's date and the group letter.  I will need to get out of my function a day (M) or a series of days (tTS), (Any).</p>

<p>Thanks, folks!</p>

<p>And before I get pointed at PEAR/PECL, I need actual code. My host has some screwy config or something, I can never seem to get the .so's to build right. If I do get the .so made, some difference in path/environment/php.ini doesn't always make it available (apache vs cron vs cli).</p>

<p>Oh, and one last thing, I'm parsing the raw email text, NOT POP3, and NOT IMAP. It's being piped into the php script via a .qmail email redirect.</p>

<p>I'm not expecting SOF to write it for me, I'm looking for some tips/starting points on doing it ""right"". This is one of those ""wheel"" problems that I know has already been solved.</p>
