My <code>contracts</code> table consists of some standard contract information, with a column for the <code>primary department</code>. This column is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_key"">foreign key</a> to my <code>Departments</code> table, where I store the basic <code>department name</code>, <code>id</code>, <code>notes</code>. This is all setup and functioning in my <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SQL_Server"">SQL Server</a>.</p>

<p>When I use the XSD tool, I can drag both tables in at once and it auto detects/creates the foreign key I have between these two tables. This works great when I'm on my main page and am viewing contract data.</p>

<p>However, when I go to my administrative page to modify the department data. I typically do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Dim dtDepartment As New DepartmentDataTable()
Dim taDepartment As New DepartmentTableAdapter()

taDepartment.Fill(dtDepartment)
</code></pre>

<p>However, at this point an exception is thrown saying to the effect that there is a foreign key reference broken here, I'm guessing since I don't have the <code>Contract</code> <code>DataTable</code> filled. </p>

<p>How can I fix this problem? I know I can simply remove the foreign key from the XSD to make things work fine, but having the additional integrity check there and having the XSD schema match the SQL schema in the database is nice.</p>

environment. Thankfully this is not production ;) The problems started
when the disk with the SQL Server databases and search index ran out
of space. Following this, the search service would not run and search
settings in the SSP were not accessible. Reclaiming the disk space did
not resolve the issue. So rather than restoring the VM, we decided to
try to fix the issue.</p>

<p>We created a new SSP and changed the association of all services to
the new SSP. The old SSP and it's databases were then deleted. Search
results for PDF files are no longer appearing, but the search works
fine otherwise. MySites also works OK.</p>

But when using a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer"">REST</a> or Rails-like URL scheme for object instances, I'd then end up with URLs like this:</p>

<pre><code>http://example.com/user/783<br></code></pre>

<p>And then the assumption is that there are also users with IDs of 782, 781, ..., 2, and 1. Assuming that the web app in question is secure enough to prevent people entering other numbers to view other users without authorization, a simple sequentially-assigned surrogate key also ""leaks"" the total number of instances (older than this one), in this case users, which might be privileged information. (For instance, I am user #726 in stackoverflow.)</p>

<p>Would a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uuid"">UUID</a>/GUID be a better solution? Then I could set up URLs like this:</p>

<pre><code>http://example.com/user/035a46e0-6550-11dd-ad8b-0800200c9a66<br></code></pre>

<p>Not exactly succinct, but there's less implied information about users on display. Sure, it smacks of ""security through obscurity"" which is no substitute for proper security, but it seems at least a little more secure.</p>

<p>Is that benefit worth the cost and complexity of implementing UUIDs for web-addressable object instances? I think that I'd still want to use integer columns as database PKs just to speed up joins.</p>

<p>There's also the question of in-database representation of UUIDs. I know MySQL stores them as 36-character strings. Postgres seems to have a more efficient internal representation (128 bits?) but I haven't tried it myself. Anyone have any experience with this?</p>

<p>A point which has been brought up recurrently, is that of dealing with system vs. user values; in our project user and system vals are stored together. For example...</p>

<p>We have a list of templates.</p>

<pre><code>1, &lt;system template&gt;

2, &lt;system template&gt;

3, &lt;system template&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>These are mapped in the app to an enum (1, 2, 3)</p>

<p>Then a user comes in and adds...</p>

<pre><code>4, &lt;user template&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>...and...</p>

<pre><code>5, &lt;user template&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then.. we issue an upgrade.. and insert as part of our upgrade scripts...</p>

<pre><code>&lt;new id&gt; [6], &lt;new system template&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>THEN!!... we find a bug in the new system template and need to update it... The problem is how? We cannot update record using ID6 (as we may have inserted it as 9, or 999, so we have to identify the record using some other mechanism)</p>

<p>So, we've come to two possible solutions for this.</p>

<h2><strong>In the red corner (speed)....</strong></h2>

<p>We simply start user Ids at 5000 (or some other value) and test data at 10000 (or some other value). This would allow us to make modifications to system values and test them up to the lower limit of the next ID range. </p>

<p>Advantage...Quick and easy to implement, </p>

<p>Disadvantage... could run out of values if we don't choose a big enough range!</p>

<h2><strong>In the blue corner (scalability)...</strong></h2>

<p>We store, system and user data separately, use GUIDs as Ids and merge the two lists using a view.</p>

<p>Advantage...Scalable..No limits w/regard to DB size. </p>

<p>Disadvantage.. More complicated to implement. (many to one updatable views etc.)</p>

<hr>

<p>I plump squarely for the first option, but looking for some ammo to back me up!</p>

<p>Does anyone have any thoughts on these approaches, or even one(s) that we've missed?</p>

<p><strong>Need</strong>: You have 40 database tables, in some, you may have a column which is a integer values 1-9 representing some enum. Sure it makes sense in code, but not if you need to SQL the DB in a report getting only rows of type ""active"" but you have no clue if active is 1,2 or 3...</p>

<p><strong>my solution</strong>: I have a wiki page and I tell each developer that each table must be there, with the schema and for each column the possible values with explanation.
I also generate the SQL server 2005 database diagram, but that is only marginally helpful since you have so many tables and so many lines connecting them.</p>

<p>Is there a better way do document what a table is, what a column is and publishing it?</p>

<p><em>Note regarding answers:</em>
Please don't answer this question thinking like an engineer! Answers like ""if you have an extra table linked with a foreign key, then anyone can see the values"" misses the point. 
A solution is good if:</p>

<ol>
<li>I can print it and send it to a partner</li>
<li>I can write free text, documenting the datable/clm. Not everything in life is self documenting. I may want to say ""this table is a report supporting table and is de-normalized data from XYZ tables.</li>

Now the script that imports data from one of the FoxPro tables bombs out about 470,000 records into the import.

<p>FYI, this is the error I'm getting:</p>

<p>There should not be any blob columns in this table.</p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestions.  I don't know if it a corruption problem for sure.  I just started downloading FoxPro from my MSDN Subscription, so I'll see if I can open the table.  SSRS opens the table, it just chokes before running through all the records.  I'm just trying to figure out which record it's having a problem with.</p>

<p>Here are some of the options:</p>

<ul>
<li>JBOD - (just a bunch of disks) Old fashioned internal disks - fast but not very expandable</li>
<li>NAS - Slow but cheap and expandable, probably best for backups</li>
<li>DAS - A decent compromise, but generally accessible from only one or two machines</li>
<li>SAN - Expensive but very good</li>
