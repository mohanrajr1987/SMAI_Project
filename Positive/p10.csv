Specifically, although I am including <code>sys/socket.h</code>, I still get compile time errors telling me that <code>AF_INET</code> is not defined. Am I missing something obvious, or could this be related to the fact that I'm doing this coding on <code>z/OS</code> and my problems are much more complicated?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Upon further investigation, I discovered that there is an #ifdef that I'm hitting. Apparently <code>z/OS</code> isn't happy unless I define which ""type"" of sockets I'm using with:</p>

<pre><code>#define _OE_SOCKETS
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I personally have no idea what this <code>_OE_SOCKETS</code> is actually for, so if any <code>z/OS</code> sockets programmers are out there (all 3 of you), perhaps you could give me a rundown of how this all works?</p>

"1069","1","1073","","2008-08-04 07:30:01","","36","30411","<p>I'm working on a <strong>multithreaded</strong> C++ application that is corrupting the heap.  The usual tools to locate this corruption seem to be inapplicable.  Old builds (18 months old) of the source code exhibit the same behaviour as the most recent release, so this has been around for a long time and just wasn't noticed; on the downside, source deltas can't be used to identify when the bug was introduced - there are <em>a lot</em> of code changes in the repository.</p>

<p>The prompt for crashing behaviuor is to generate throughput in this system - socket transfer of data which is munged into an internal representation.  I have a set of test data that will periodically cause the app to exception (various places, various causes - including heap alloc failing, thus: heap corruption).</p>

<p>The behaviour seems related to CPU power or memory bandwidth; the more of each the machine has, the easier it is to crash.  Disabling a hyper-threading core or a dual-core core reduces the rate of (but does not eliminate) corruption.  This suggests a timing related issue.</p>

<p>Now here's the rub:<br>
When it's run under a lightweight debug environment (say <code>Visual Studio 98 / AKA MSVC6</code>) the heap corruption is reasonably easy to reproduce - ten or fifteen minutes pass before something fails horrendously and exceptions, like an <code>alloc;</code> when running under a sophisticated debug environment (Rational Purify, <code>VS2008/MSVC9</code> or even Microsoft Application Verifier) the system becomes memory-speed bound and doesn't crash (Memory-bound: CPU is not getting above <code>50%</code>, disk light is not on, the program's going as fast it can, box consuming <code>1.3G</code> of 2G of RAM).  So, <strong>I've got a choice between being able to reproduce the problem (but not identify the cause) or being able to idenify the cause or a problem I can't reproduce.</strong></p>

<p>My current best guesses as to where to next is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Get an insanely grunty box (to replace the current dev box: 2Gb RAM in an <code>E6550 Core2 Duo</code>); this will make it possible to repro the crash causing mis-behaviour when running under a powerful debug environment; or</li>
<li>Rewrite operators <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code> to use <code>VirtualAlloc</code> and <code>VirtualProtect</code> to mark memory as read-only as soon as it's done with.  Run under <code>MSVC6</code> and have the OS catch the bad-guy who's writing to freed memory.  Yes, this is a sign of desperation: who the hell rewrites <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code>?!  I wonder if this is going to make it as slow as under Purify et al.</li>
</ol>

<p>And, no: Shipping with Purify instrumentation built in is not an option.</p>

<p>A colleague just walked past and asked ""Stack Overflow?  Are we getting stack overflows now?!?""</p>

<p>And now, the question: <strong>How do I locate the heap corruptor?</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>Update: balancing <code>new[]</code> and <code>delete[]</code> seems to have gotten a long way towards solving the problem.  Instead of 15mins, the app now goes about two hours before crashing.  Not there yet.  Any further suggestions? The heap corruption persists.</p>

<p>Update: a release build under Visual Studio 2008 seems dramatically better; current suspicion rests on the <code>STL</code> implementation that ships with <code>VS98</code>.</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Reproduce the problem. <code>Dr Watson</code> will produce a dump that might be helpful in further analysis. </li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>I'll take a note of that, but I'm concerned that Dr Watson will only be tripped up after the fact, not when the heap is getting stomped on.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Another try might be using <code>WinDebug</code> as a debugging tool which is quite powerful being at the same time also lightweight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Got that going at the moment, again: not much help until something goes wrong.  I want to catch the vandal in the act.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Maybe these tools will allow you at least to narrow the problem to certain component.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't hold much hope, but desperate times call for...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And are you sure that all the components of the project have correct runtime library settings (<code>C/C++ tab</code>, Code Generation category in VS 6.0 project settings)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No I'm not, and I'll spend a couple of hours tomorrow going through the workspace (58 projects in it) and checking they're all compiling and linking with the appropriate flags.

<li>Lazily constructed in a thread safe manner (two threads might simultaneously be the first user of the singleton - it should still only be constructed once).</li>
<li>Doesn't rely on static variables being constructed beforehand (so the singleton object is itself safe to use during the construction of static variables).</li>
</ol>

<p>(I don't know my C++ well enough, but is it the case that integral and constant static variables are initialized before any code is executed (ie, even before static constructors are executed - their values may already be ""initialized"" in the program image)?  If so - perhaps this can be exploited to implement a singleton mutex - which can in turn be used to guard the creation of the real singleton..)</p>

<hr>

<p>Excellent, it seems that I have a couple of good answers now (shame I can't mark 2 or 3 as being <strong>the answer</strong>).  There appears to be two broad solutions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use static initialisation (as opposed to dynamic initialisation) of a POD static variable, and implementing my own mutex with that using the builtin atomic instructions.  This was the type of solution I was hinting at in my question, and I believe I knew already.</li>
<li>Use some other library function like <a href=""http://opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xsh/pthread_once.html"">pthread_once</a> or <a href=""http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_33_1/doc/html/call_once.html"">boost::call_once</a>.

This is based off the fact that I added a <code>std::string</code> to a class and assigning it a value from another <code>std::string</code>:</p>

<pre><code>std::string hello = ""Hello, world.\n"";
/* exampleString = ""Hello, world.\n"" would work fine. */
exampleString = hello;

<p>crashes on my system with a stack dump. So basically I need to <strong>stop</strong> and go through all my code and memory management stuff and find out where I've screwed up. The codebase is still small (about 1000 lines), so this is easily do-able. </p>

<p>Still, I'm over my head with this kind of stuff, so I thought I'd throw it out there. I'm on a Linux system, and have poked around with <code>valgrind</code>, and while not knowing completely what I'm doing, it did report that the <code>std::string</code>'s destructor was an invalid free. I have to admit to getting the term 'Heap Corruption' from a Google search; any general purpose articles on this sort of stuff would be appreciated as well.</p>

<p>(In before <code>rm -rf ProjectDir</code>, do again in C# :D)</p>

<p>EDIT:
I haven't made it clear, but what I'm asking for are ways an advice of diagnosing these sort of memory problems. I know the std::string stuff is right, so it's something I've done (or a bug, but there's Not A Problem With Select). I'm sure I could chuck the code I've written up and you very smart folks would see the problem in no time, but I want to add this kind of code analysis to my 'toolbox', as it were.</p>

<hr>

<p>Update:
@Lars - I do use Enyim actually - it's very good, but what you're referring to is a client, rather than the server part.</p>

<p>@DannySmurf - I've only been able to install it as a service on a 32 bit OS. 64 bit OS rejects the installation of this Win32 service. Of course yes, lots of Win32 code works seamlessly on x64 architecture, hence you can run 32bit apps (like Office for instance) or games on Vista/XP 64 etc, but this doesn't translate directly when it comes to services. I'm no expert, I suspect that it has to do with the syncs or eventing that services need to subscribe to, and I suspect that 64 and 32 don't play nicely. I'm happy to be corrected on any of this, but to answer your question - yes I have tried.</p>

<p>@OJ - thanks very much for the straight-forward response. I thought as much, but wasn't sure if anyone else had suggestions or had already gone down this route. Maybe when StackOverflow is LIVE, then more people will respond and let me know if this is something being looked into, and although I can try and compile it myself - I simply can't ""trust"" (with my C++ experience level) that it would provide ""Enterprise Level"" reliability in such a crucial component of large scalable solutions. I think it would need educated intervention rather than my unsanitised experimental approach before I could be confident. One little oversight on my part, could bring the site down. Oh well... till next time... </p>

<p>I am currently working on a new area of the UI which is quite separate from the rest of the product. I have therefore been given the chance to try out 'new' technology stacks as a sort of proving ground before the long process of moving over the rest of the UI begins.</p>

<p>I have been using C# with Windows Forms and the .net framework for a while in my spare time and enjoy it, but am somewhat worried about the headaches caused by interop. While this particular branch of the UI won't require much interop with the legacy C++ codebase, I can forsee this becoming an issue in the future.</p>

<p>The alternative is just to continue with MFC, but try and take advantage of the new feature pack that shipped with VS2008. This I guess is the easiest option, but I worry about longevity and not taking advantage of the goodness that is .net...</p>

<p>So, which do I pick? We're a small team so my recommendation will quite probably be accepted as a future direction for our development - I want to get it right.</p>

<p>Is MFC dead? Is C#/Winforms the way forward? Is there anything else I'm totally missing? Help greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>I have developed a code-generator that takes our python interface to our C++ code (generated via SWIG) and generates code needed to expose this as WebServices.  When I developed this code I did it using TDD, but I've found my tests to be brittle as hell.  Because each test essentially wanted to verify that for a given bit of input code (which happens to be a C++ header) I'd get a given bit of outputted code I wrote a small engine that reads test definitions from XML input files and generates test cases from these expectations.</p>

<p>The problem is I dread going in to modify the code at all.  That and the fact that the unit tests themselves are a: complex, and b: brittle.</p>

<p>So I'm trying to think of alternative approaches to this problem, and it strikes me I'm perhaps tackling it the wrong way.  Maybe I need to focus more on the outcome, IE: does the code I generate actually run and do what I want it to, rather than, does the code look the way I want it to.</p>

<p>Has anyone got any experiences of something similar to this they would care to share?</p>

In particular, different objects would ideally act the same, which would be very easily achieved with polymorphism.  The problem I have with it is that inheritance implies the <em>is a</em> relationship, rather than the <em>has a</em> relationship.  For example, several objects <em>have a</em> damage counter, but to make this easy to use in an object list, polymorphism could be used - except that would imply an <em>is a</em> relationship which wouldn't be true.  (A person <em>is not a</em> damage counter.)</p>

<p>The only solution I can think of is to have a member of the class return the proper object type when implicitly casted instead of relying on inheritance.  Would it be better to forgo the <em>is a</em> / <em>has a</em> ideal in exchange for ease of programming?</p>

<p>Edit:
To be more specific, I am using C++, so using polymorphism would allow the different objects to ""act the same"" in the sense that the derived classes could reside within a single list and be operated upon by a virtual function of the base class.  The use of an interface (or imitating them via inheritance) seems like a solution I would be willing to use.</p>
