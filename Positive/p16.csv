I understand that it's not always a good decision to do so. But, how might one do this?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 8/04/2008 00:21:01 EST:</strong></p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/982"">That</a> looks like a good answer John Downey, I tried it but it appears that it ends up being not a <em>true</em> method.  Your example defines the new patch function with an argument of <strong>self</strong>, but if you write actual code that way, the now patched class method asks for an argument named self (it doesn't automagically recognize it as the object to which it is supposed to bind, which is what would happen if defined within the class definition), meaning you have to call <strong>class.patch(obj)</strong> instead of just <strong>class.patch()</strong> if you want the same functionality as a <em>true</em> method. <strong>It looks like python isn't really treating it as a method, but more just as a variable which happens to be a function</strong> (and as such is callable).  Is there any way to attach an actual method to a class?</p>

<p>Oh, and Ryan, <a href=""http://pypi.python.org/pypi/monkey"">that</a> isn't exactly what I was looking for (it isn't builtin functionality), but it is quite cool nonetheless.</p>

<p>A dict of dicts is more flexible and simpler to implement, but I intuitively expect a list of lists to be faster. The list option would also require that I keep the data separate from the structure, while dicts would allow for something of the sort:</p>

<p>What would you suggest?</p>

<hr>

<p>Yes, I should have been a bit clearer on what I mean by efficiency. In this particular case I mean it in terms of random access retrieval.</p>

<p>Loading the data in to memory isn't a huge problem. That's done once and for all. The time consuming part is visiting the nodes so I can extract the information and measure the metrics I'm interested in.</p>

<p>I hadn't considered making each node a class (properties are the same for all nodes) but it seems like that would add an extra layer of overhead?

<ul>
<li>Python 2.5 and earlier: can express binary using <code>int('01010101111',2)</code> but not with a literal.</li>
<li>Python 2.5 and earlier: there is <em>no way</em> to express binary literals.</li>
<li>Python 2.6 beta: You can do like so: <code>0b1100111</code> or <code>0B1100111</code>.</li>
<li>Python 2.6 beta: will also allow <code>0o27</code> or <code>0O27</code> (second character is the letter O) to represent an octal.</li>
<li>Python 3.0 beta: Same as 2.6, but will no longer allow the older <code>027</code> syntax for octals.</li>

"5966","1","10778","","2008-08-08 14:05:45","","7","570","<p>Basically, I've written an API to www.thetvdb.com in Python. The current code can be found <a href=""http://github.com/dbr/tvdb_api/tree/master/tvdb_api.py"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

<p>It grabs data from the API as requested, and has to store the data somehow, and make it available by doing:</p>

<pre><code>print tvdbinstance[1][23]['episodename'] # get the name of episode 23 of season 1<br></code></pre>

<p>What is the ""best"" way to abstract this data within the Tvdb() class?</p>

<p>I originally used a extended Dict() that automatically created sub-dicts (so you could do <code>x[1][2][3][4] = ""something""</code> without having to do <code>if x[1].has_key(2): x[1][2] = []</code> and so on)</p>

<p>Then I just stored the data by doing <code>self.data[show_id][season_number][episode_number][attribute_name] = ""something""</code></p>

<p>This worked okay, but there was no easy way of checking if x[3][24] was supposed to exist or not (so I couldn't raise the season_not_found exception)</p>

<p>Currently it's using four classes. ShowContainer, Show, Season and Episode. Each one is a very basic dict, which I can easily add extra functionality in (the search() function on Show() for example). Each has a <code>__setitem__</code>, <code>__getitem_</code> and <code>has_key</code></p>

<p>This works mostly fine, I can check in Shows if it has that season in it's self.data dict, if not, raise season_not_found. Check in Season() if it has that episode and so on.</p>

<p>The problem now is it's presenting itself as a dict, but doesn't have all the functionality, and because I'm overriding the <em>_getitem_</em> and <em>_setitem_</em> functions, it's easy to accidently recursively call <em>_getitem_</em> (so I'm not sure if extending the Dict class will cause problems)</p>

<p>The other slight problem is adding data into the dict is a lot more work than the old Ddict method (which was <code>self.data[seas_no][ep_no]['attribute'] = 'something'</code>). See _setItem and _setData. It's not too bad, since it's currently only a read-only API interface (so the users of the API should only ever retrieve data, not add more), but it's hardly.. elegant..</p>

<p>I think the series-of-classes system is probably the best way, but does anyone have a better idea for storing the data? And would extending the ShowContainer/etc classes with Dict cause problems?</p>","745","dbr","2134","Chris Fournier","2008-08-25 12:56:23","2012-10-29 20:55:28","Best way to abstract season/show/episode data","<python><data-structures>","5","0","","","","5966","16"

I know Python fairly well and plan on implementing everything in Python to begin with but envisage that I may have to re-implement some core routines in a compiled language eventually.</p>

<p>IIRC, one of Python's original remits was as a prototyping language, however Python is pretty liberal in allowing functions, functors, objects to be passed to functions and methods, whereas I suspect the same is not true of say C or Fortran.</p>

<p>What should I know about designing functions/classes which I envisage will have to interface into the compiled language? And how much of these potential problems are dealt with by libraries such as cTypes, bgen, <a href=""http://www.swig.org/"">SWIG</a>, <a href=""http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_35_0/libs/python/doc/index.html"">Boost.Python</a>, <a href=""http://cython.org/"">Cython</a> or <a href=""http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/sip/intro"">Python SIP</a>?</p>

<p>For this particular use case, (a fitting library) I imagine allowing users to define mathematical functions (Guassian, Lorentzian etc.) as Python functions which can then to be passed an interpreted by the compiled code fitting library. Passing and returning arrays is also essential.</p>

<p>Currently: I have three arrays of regex, one for valid filenames, one for files missing an episode name, and one for valid paths.</p>

<p>Then, I loop though each valid-filename regex, if it matches, append it to a ""valid"" dict, if not, do the same with the missing-ep-name regexs, if it matches this I append it to an ""invalid"" dict with an error code (2:'missing epsiode name'), if it matches neither, it gets added to invalid with the 'malformed name' error code.</p>

<p>How could I write this system in a more expandable way?</p>

<p>The rules it needs to check would be..</p>

<ul>
<li>File is in the format <code>Show Name - [01x23] - Episode Name.avi</code> or <code>Show Name - [01xSpecial02] - Special Name.avi</code> or <code>Show Name - [01xExtra01] - Extra Name.avi</code></li>
<li>If filename is in the format <code>Show Name - [01x23].avi</code> display it a 'missing episode name' section of the output</li>
<li>The path should be in the format <code>Show Name/season 2/the_file.avi</code> (where season 2 should be the correct season number in the filename)</li>
<li>each <code>Show Name/season 1/</code> folder should contain ""folder.jpg""</li>
</ul>

<p>.any ideas? While I'm trying to check TV episodes, this concept/code should be able to apply to many things..</p>

<pre><code>checker = [
{
    'name':'valid files',
    'type':'file',
    'function':check_valid(), # runs check_valid() on all files
    'status':0 # if it returns True, this is the status the file gets

<p>I'm looking for something like the <code>tempfile</code> module in Python: A (preferably) secure way to open a file for writing to. This should be easy to delete when I'm done too...</p>

<p>It seems, .NET does not have the ""batteries included"" features of the <code>tempfile</code> module, which not only creates the file, but returns the file descriptor (old school, I know...) to it along with the path. At the same time, it makes sure only the creating user can access the file and whatnot (<code>mkstemp()</code> I think): <a href=""https://docs.python.org/library/tempfile.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.python.org/library/tempfile.html</a></p>

<hr>

<p>Ah, yes, I can see that. But GetTempFileName does have a drawback: There is a race condition between when the file was created (upon call to GetTempFileName a 0-Byte file gets created) and when I get to open it (after return of GetTempFileName). This might be a security issue, although not for my current application...</p>
