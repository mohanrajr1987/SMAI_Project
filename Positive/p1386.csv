<p>I've been trying to use the <code>ItemizedOverlay</code> and <code>OverlayItem</code> classes. Their intended purpose is to simulate map markers (as seen in Google Maps Mashups) but I've had problems getting them to appear on the map.</p>

<p>I can add my own custom overlays using a similar technique, it's just the <code>ItemizedOverlays</code> that don't work.</p>

<p>Once I've implemented my own <code>ItemizedOverlay</code> (and overridden createItem), creating a new instance of my class seems to work (I can extract OverlayItems from it) but adding it to a map's Overlay list doesn't make it appear as it should.</p>

<p>This is the code I use to add the <code>ItemizedOverlay</code> class as an Overlay on to my <code>MapView</code>.</p>

<pre><code>// Add the ItemizedOverlay to the Map
private void addItemizedOverlay() {
  Resources r = getResources();
  MapView mapView = (MapView)findViewById(R.id.mymapview);
  List&lt;Overlay&gt; overlays = mapView.getOverlays();

  MyItemizedOverlay markers = new MyItemizedOverlay(r.getDrawable(R.drawable.icon));
  overlays.add(markers);

  OverlayItem oi = markers.getItem(0);
  markers.setFocus(oi);
  mapView.postInvalidate();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>MyItemizedOverlay</code> is defined as:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyItemizedOverlay extends ItemizedOverlay&lt;OverlayItem&gt; {
  public MyItemizedOverlay(Drawable defaultMarker) {
    super(defaultMarker);
    populate();
  }

  @Override
  protected OverlayItem createItem(int index) {
    Double lat = (index+37.422006)*1E6;
    Double lng = -122.084095*1E6;
    GeoPoint point = new GeoPoint(lat.intValue(), lng.intValue());

    OverlayItem oi = new OverlayItem(point, ""Marker"", ""Marker Text"");
    return oi;
  }

  @Override
  public int size() {
    return 5;
  } 
}

<p>So the menu is essentially just a bunch of nodes with the text contained in the mainItems array.  I know that I can create an XML layout (i.e. <code>R.layout.mainMenu_item</code>) that has an ImageView and TextView in it, but I am unsure how to set the ImageView's icon.  I have seen that there is a setImageResouce(int resId) method, but the way to use this when generating with an ArrayAdapter is eluding me.  Is there a better way to do this?</p>

<p><strong>Is there a way to make my mobile phone trigger an action on my computer?</strong> I am thinking that with a smart phone it must be possible to link the phone and the pc with bluetooth, and have some sort of small program running on my computer that will listen for incoming phonecalls on the phone. When someone calls me, I want my mobile to simply submit the callers phonenumber to the pc, and then the pc will do its stuff from there. Then, I want to handle the call on the mobile phone as usual.</p>

<p>Edit:
Updated this question! I am currently using the HTC Hero, and hopefully the Android SDK will make this more easy to accomplish.</p>

<p>My specific scenario was:
When my phone (Nokia N82) calls, i want to submit the callers phonenumber to a search applet/application, that will query Microsoft Dynamics CRM and see if a contact person or a company has that phonenumber, and if so, show the corresponding person or companys info on my screen. My preferred development platform is .Net</p>

I'm looking for things such as system wide notification when text is displayed, notification of a new application being launched, etc. I'd rather not have to modify the kernel source and only allow my app to run on a developer phone. Two, how much processor and memory are left over on the G1 assuming no applications running? Three assuming average use of applications on the phone how much processor and memory are left?
<br>More info<br>
I'm aware that applications should not be designed to work on a specific phone. I picked the G1 because it's the most popular phone currently running Android that I know of. I am looking for lower end system specs that my program would have to fit in, it may run great on a netbook with Android installed but use to much memory and processor to run on most Android handsets.

There are now two screen reader projects that use Android 1.6, they can be found at

I have 3 tabs on a view</p>

<pre><code>A) contains gMap activity
 B) camera activity
 C) some random text fields.
</code></pre>

<p>Requirement is that the application runs in Portrait mode. </p>

<p>All 3 tabs work as expected w/ the exception of the Camera Preview Surface (B). It is rotated 90 degrees. They only way to make it correct is to set the app to landscape which throws all my tabs around, and is pretty much unworkable.</p>

<p>My solution is this : replace </p>

<p>my camera activity with a regular activity that is empty w/ the exception of </p>

<pre><code>Intent i = new Intent(this,CameraActivity.class);
    startActivity(i);
</code></pre>

<p>This launches my CameraActivity. And that works fine. I had to do a linear layout and include 3 images that look like real tabs, so I can try and mimic the operation of the tabs while rotating the screen to landscape and keep the visuals as portrait.
The user can click one of the images(buttons) to display the next tab. This is my issue. It should exit my 'camera activity' returning to the 'blank activity' in a tab, where it should be interpreted to click the desiered tab from my image. </p>

<p>The main thing is, when it returns, it returns to a blank (black) page under a tab (because it is 'empty'). How can I capture the return event back to the page that called the activity, and then see what action they performed? </p>

<p>I can set an onclicklistener where I can respond to the fake tabs (images) being clicked to exit out of the camera activity. On exit, the tab should update so that is where you return. any Suggestions?</p>

<p>with all the buzz around the iPhone / AppStore etc, I felt it to be a no-brainer to create a nice iPhone application for the web-application I've been putting together, but how's your experience with the Android Platform so far - is it interesting already from a sales &amp; user-volume?</p>

<p>I've had a quick look at the T-Mobile G1 and from an end-user perspective I didn't think it is all to appealing and to me it seems it'll take a while until all this takes off.</p>

<p>Does anyone of you already have an or multiple apps finished for the platform? How's your take on this.. are sales lower/higher than you expected them to be? Is it worth investing the time &amp; money (right now) to build an android version of my app? Being 'worth' obviously is a very flexible term and depends on someone's point of view, but basically right now every hour I don't work on the webapplication itself basically 'has' to pay off fairly quickly.. and that's why I'm reaching out for some real-life experience.</p>

Now, this is probably how it's supposed to be, but I do a lot of initial setting up in the <code>onCreate</code> method, so I need either:</p>

<ol>
<li>Put all the initial setting up in another function so it's not all lost on device rotation or</li>
<li>Make it so <code>onCreate</code> is not called again and the layout just adjusts or</li>
<li>Limit the app to just portrait so that <code>onCreate</code> is not called.</li>

I would like to launch like a popup window in landscape orientation with the background image fogged out. I know there is a Popup Widget, but any ideas for rotating the text edit box would be great. Rotating it into a portrait view (text box only) when the keyboard is slid out would also work, as would showing a new screen with the text box on keyboard slide.</p>
