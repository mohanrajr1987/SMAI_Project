The reason for that is that the current developers are heavy on <strong>Java</strong> but felt the need for a <strong>MVC-style language</strong> for some future web development projects. Personally, I'm coming from the design/usability world, but as I take more ""front-end"" responsibilities I'm starting to feel the need for learning a language more intensively so I can code some logic but especially the front-end code for my UIs and stuff.</p>

<p>I've been trying to get into <strong>Python/Django</strong> personally, but just never invested too much time on it. Now that my company is ""jumping"" into Grails I bought the ""<em>Agile Web Development with Rails (3rd Ed - Beta)</em>"" and I'm starting to get into <strong>RoR</strong>. I'd still like to learn <strong>Python</strong> in the future or on the side, but my biggest question is: </p>

<ul>
<li>Should I be learning RoR, and have a more versatile language in my ""portfolio"", knowing that my RoR knowledge will be useful for my Grails needs as well??</li>
</ul>

<p>-OR-</p>

<ul>
<li>Should I just skip RoR and focus on learning Grails that I'll be needing for work soon, and work on learning RoR/Django (Ruby/Python) later?</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically the question revolves around the usefulness of Grails in a non-corporate setting and the similarities between Rails and Grails. (and this, while trying to avoid the centennial discussion of Python vs Ruby (on Rails) :))</p>

What the author doesn't mention, though, is that <code>StringIO</code> is just an ""I.""  There's no ""O.""  You <em>can't</em> do this, for example:</p>

<pre><code>s = StringIO.new
s &lt;&lt; 'foo'
s &lt;&lt; 'bar'
s.to_s
# =&gt; should be ""foo\nbar""
# =&gt; really is ''`
</code></pre>

<p>Ruby really needs a StringBuffer just like the one Java has. StringBuffers serve two important purposes. First, they let you test the output half of what Ruby's StringIO does. Second, they are useful for building up long strings from small parts -- something that Joel reminds us over and over again is otherwise very very slow.</p>

<p>Is there a good replacement?</p>

<p>It's true that Strings in Ruby are mutable, but that doesn't mean we should always rely on that functionality.  If <code>stuff</code> is large, the performance and memory requirements of this, for example, is really bad.</p>

<pre><code>result = stuff.map(&amp;:to_s).join(' ')
</code></pre>

<p>The ""correct"" way to do this in Java is:</p>

<pre><code>result = StringBuffer.new("""")
for(String s : stuff) {
  result.append(s);
}
</code></pre>

Part of this refactoring, has been to move code that's common to two of my models to a module that I can include where I need it.</p>

<p>So far, so good. Looks like it's going to work out, but I've just hit a problem that I'm not sure how to get around.  The module (which I've called sendable), is just going to be the code that handles faxing, e-mailing, or printing a PDF of the document.  So, for example, I have a purchase order, and I have Internal Sales Orders (imaginatively abbreviated to ISO).</p>

<p>The problem I've struck, is that I want some variables initialised (initialized for people who don't spell correctly :P ) after the object is loaded, so I've been using the <strong>after_initialize</strong> hook. No problem... until I start adding some more mixins.</p>

<p>The problem I have, is that I can have an <strong><code>after_initialize</code></strong> in any one of my mixins, so I need to include a <strong>super</strong> call at the start to make sure the other mixin <strong><code>after_initialize</code></strong> calls get called.  Which is great, until I end up calling super and I get an error because there is no super to call.</p>

<p>Here's a little example, in case I haven't been confusing enough:</p>

<pre><code>class Iso &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  include Shared::TracksSerialNumberExtension
  include Shared::OrderLines
  extend  Shared::Filtered
  include Sendable::Model

  validates_presence_of   :customer
  validates_associated    :lines

  owned_by                :customer
  order_lines             :despatched # Mixin

  tracks_serial_numbers   :items  # Mixin

  sendable :customer                      # Mixin

  attr_accessor :address

  def initialize( params = nil )
    super
    self.created_at ||= Time.now.to_date
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>So, if each one of the mixins have an after_initialize call, with a <strong>super</strong> call, how can I stop that last <strong>super</strong> call from raising the error? How can I test that the super method exists before I call it?</p>

Essentially, I'm using the attachment-fu plugin on two levels.
The first is for user avatars in the user class.
The second is to allow file attachments (<strong><em>PDFs</em></strong>, etc) in a messaging system.
My question is what the best use practice would be in these situations to remain <strong><em>DRY</em></strong>, clear, and consistent.
Clearly it would make no sense to define and execute the plugin in both classes, but there's something deeply strange to me (possibly unfounded) about just going ahead and setting it all up in the godly Application class.
Is there something in between, or is the parent class the way to go?</p>

<p>And everything seems to be working according to plan, but when trying to execute to show unread messages in my message view, I'm running into problems.</p>

<pre><code>bob = User.find_by_name(""bob"")

bob.readings                      # =&gt; []

Post.find_unread_by(bob)          # =&gt; [&lt;Post 1&gt;,&lt;Post 2&gt;,&lt;Post 3&gt;...]

Post.find(1).read_by!(bob)        # =&gt; &lt;Reading 1&gt;
Post.find(1).read_by?(bob)        # =&gt; true
Post.find(1).users_who_read       # =&gt; [&lt;User bob&gt;]

Post.find_unread_by(bob)          # =&gt; [&lt;Post 2&gt;,&lt;Post 3&gt;...]
Post.find_read_by(bob)            # =&gt; [&lt;Post 1&gt;]

bob.readings                      # =&gt; [&lt;Reading 1&gt;]
</code></pre>

<p>So it seems as though if I wanted to list the number of unread messages sitting in a mailbox (for example Inbox (39) ), I should be able to do something like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%= Post.find_unread_by(current-user).count %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But to no avail.  I always seem to get stuck on the simple view issues after everything's set.

I have chosen to use hpricot because it looks great.
Anyway, _why's been nice enough to provide the following example on the <a href=""http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/hpricot/"" rel=""nofollow"">hpricot website</a>:</p>

<pre><code> #!ruby
 require 'hpricot'
 require 'open-uri'
 # load the RedHanded home page
 doc = Hpricot(open(""http://redhanded.hobix.com/index.html""))
 # change the CSS class on links
 (doc/""span.entryPermalink"").set(""class"", ""newLinks"")
 # remove the sidebar
 (doc/""#sidebar"").remove
 # print the altered HTML
 puts doc

Works great in Ruby, but my question is: How do I break this up in rails?</p>

<p>I experimented with adding this all to a single controller, but couldn't think of the best way to call it in a view.</p>

<p>So if you were parsing an XML file from a web API and printing it in nice clean HTML with Hpricot, how would you break up the activity over the models, views, and controllers, and what would you put where?</p>

<p>** Original question: **</p>

<p>One thing that concerns me as a security professional is that Ruby doesn't have a parallel of Java's package-privacy.  That is, this isn't valid Ruby:</p>

<pre><code>public module Foo
  public module Bar
    # factory method for new Bar implementations
    def self.new(...)
      SimpleBarImplementation.new(...)
    end
    def baz
      raise NotImplementedError.new('Implementing Classes MUST redefine #baz')
    end
  end

  private class SimpleBarImplementation
    include Bar
    def baz
      ...
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>It'd be really nice to be able to prevent monkey-patching of Foo::BarImpl.  That way, people who rely on the library know that nobody has messed with it.  Imagine if somebody changed the implementation of MD5 or SHA1 on you!  I can call <code>freeze</code> on these classes, but I have to do it on a class-by-class basis, and other scripts might modify them before I finish securing my application if I'm not <strong>very</strong> careful about load order.</p>

<p>Java provides lots of other tools for defensive programming, many of which are not possible in Ruby.  (See Josh Bloch's book for a good list.)  Is this really a concern?  Should I just stop complaining and use Ruby for lightweight things and not hope for ""enterprise-ready"" solutions?</p>

<p>(And no, core classes are not frozen by default in Ruby.  See below:)</p>

<pre><code>require 'md5'
# =&gt; true
MD5.frozen?
# =&gt; false
</code></pre>
