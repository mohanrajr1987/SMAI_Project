<p><strong>Mike Stone had the best answer so far -- not <em>exactly</em> what I was looking for but it worked for what I needed</strong>  </p>

<p>Edit - this sort of worked, but after storing the macro, when I went back to use it later, I couldn't use it with <kbd>C-x e</kbd>.  (i.e., if I reboot emacs and then type <kbd>M-x macro-name</kbd>, and then <kbd>C-x e</kbd>, I get a message in the minibuffer like 'no last kbd macro' or something similar)</p>

<p>@Mike Stone - Thanks for the information.  I tried creating a macro like so:</p>

<pre><code>C-x( M-C-s ^.*Table\(\(.*C-q C-J\)*?GO\) C-x)
</code></pre>

<p>This created my macro, but when I executed my macro I didn't get the same highlighting that I ordinarily get when I use <code>isearch-forward-regexp</code>.  Instead it just jumped to the end of the next match of the expression. So that doesn't really work for what I need. Any ideas?</p>

<p>Edit: It looks like I <em>can</em> use macros to do what I want, I just have to think outside the box of <code>isearch-forward-regexp</code>. I'll try what you suggested.</p>

<p>My question is: Is there a (reasonably) simple way to parse these <em>and</em> validate with a single regular expression?  i.e.:</p>

<pre><code>if ($str =~ /someexpression/)

    $x = $1;
    $y = $2;

<p>Note that the string may consist of <em>only</em> <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> attributes.  This is a valid string.</p>

<p>I think this is a fairly naive regular expression but it's a fine starting point for building something better.  But, my question is this:</p>

<p>What is the point of ""{1}""?  It means ""exactly one of the previous grouping"", right?  Isn't that the default behavior of a grouping in a regular expression?  Would the expression be changed in any way if the {1} were removed?</p>

<p>and return the following using Split:
    H3Y5NC8E
    TGA5B6SB
    2NVAQ4E0</p>

<p>I validate each character against a specific character set (note that the letters 'I', 'O', 'U' &amp; 'W' are absent), so using string.Split is not an option. The number of characters in each group can vary and the number of groups can also vary. I am using the following expression:</p>

<pre><code>([ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTVXYZ0123456789]{8}-?){3}
</code></pre>

<p>This will match exactly 3 groups of 8 characters each. Any more or less will fail the match.
This works insofar as it correctly matches the input. However, when I use the Split method to extract each character group, I just get the final group. RegexBuddy complains that I have repeated the capturing group itself and that I should put a capture group around the repeated group. However, none of my attempts to do this achieve the desired result. I have been trying expressions like this:</p>

<pre><code>(([ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTVXYZ0123456789]{8})-?){4}
</code></pre>

<p>But this does not work.</p>

<p>Since I generate the regex in code, I could just expand it out by the number of groups, but I was hoping for a more elegant solution. </p>

<hr>

<p>Please note that the character set does not include the entire alphabet. It is part of a product activation system. As such, any characters that can be accidentally interpreted as numbers or other characters are removed. e.g. The letters 'I', 'O', 'U' &amp; 'W' are not in the character set.</p>

The first step of the parsing process splits the file into individual lines by just using a <code>StreamReader</code> object and calling <code>ReadLine</code> until it's through the file. However, any given line might contain a quoted (in single quotes) literal with embedded newlines.  I need to find those newlines and convert them temporarily into some other kind of token or escape sequence until I've split the file into an array of lines..then I can change them back. </p>

<p>I could write all of the C# code needed to do this by using <code>string.IndexOf</code> to find the quoted sections and look within them for newlines, but I'm thinking a Regex might be a better choice (i.e. <a href=""http://regex.info/blog/2006-09-15/247"" rel=""nofollow"">now I have two problems</a>)</p>

<p>@samjudson:</p>

<p><em>You need to pass the RegexOptions.Singleline flag in to the regular expression, so that ""."" matches all characters, not just all characters except new lines (which is the default).</em></p>

<p>I tried that, but then it matches the whole file. I also tried to set the message-group to .+? (non-greedy), but then it matches a single character (which isn't what I'm looking for either).</p>

<p>The problem is that the pattern for the message matches on the date-group as well, so when it doesn't break on a new-line it just goes on and on and on.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>I use this regex for the message group now. It works, unless there's a pattern IN the log message which is the same as the start of the log message.</p>
