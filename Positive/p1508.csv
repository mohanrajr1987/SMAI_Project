I'm thinking that maybe I can store the data somewhere else (maybe in memory) so the web service can just get the data from there the next time it's trying to query the same data. I kinda understand what needs to be done but I'm just not sure how to actually do it. How do we persist data in a web service? </p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>
Both suggestions, caching and using static variables, look good. Maybe I should just use both so I can look at one first, and if it's not in there, use the second one, if it's not in there either, then I'll look at the json file.</p>

At the moment, every application we distribute is using it's own ad-hoc configuration files, whether it's property files (ini style), XML or JSON (internal use only at the moment!).</p>

<p>Most of our code is Java at the moment, so we've been looking at <a href=""http://commons.apache.org/configuration/"">Apache Commons Config</a>, but we've found it to be quite verbose. We've also looked at <a href=""http://xmlbeans.apache.org/"">XMLBeans</a>, but it seems like a lot of faffing around. I also feel as though I'm being pushed towards XML as a format, but my clients and colleagues are apprehensive about trying something else. I can understand it from the client's perspective, everybody's heard of XML, but at the end of the day, shouldn't be using the right tool for the job?</p>

<p>What formats and libraries are people using in production systems these days, is anyone else trying to avoid the <a href=""http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001114.html"">angle bracket tax</a>?</p>

<p><em>Edit: really needs to be a cross platform solution: Linux, Windows, Solaris etc. and the choice of library used to interface with configuration files is just as important as the choice of format</em></p>

The only thing I can think of is that there are a couple extra bytes for the callback wrapper... </p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>I found <a href=""http://remysharp.com/2007/10/08/what-is-jsonp/"">this</a> which also suggests security and error handling as potential problems... </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There's no error handling. The script
  injection either works, or it doesn't.
  If there's an error from the
  injection, it'll hit the page, and
  short of a window wide error handler
  (bad, bad, very bad), you need to be
  sure the return value is valid on the
  server side.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't think error handling is much of a problem... most of us would use a library to generate the JSON... the well-formedness of my response isn't a concern for this question.</p>

<p>and security:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Security. There's documents out on the
  web that can help, but as a cursory
  check, I would check the referrer in
  the server side script.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>it seems like this is a potential problem with any type of response... certainly there's nothing unique to JSONP in the security arena...?</p>

We've decided to provide XML and JSON due to the difficulty in recursion in CSV needing multiple calls for a single logical operation.

<p>However, when passing a <code>JSON object</code> from the client to some method that serializes my JSON into the .NET representation, NHibernate seems to get confused. It comes up with the correct query to add the parent (and assigns a new guid for Id), however, it doesn't associate that parent id to the children objects in the `SQL it tries to execute. I came up with a quick and dirty hack, which I list below - But I was wondering, is there something I'm missing here?</p>

<pre><code>IList&lt;BackerEntry&gt; backersTemp = new List&lt;BackerEntry&gt;();
foreach (BackerEntry backerEntry in jsonBackerEntity.BackerEntries)

jsonBackerEntity.BackerEntries.Clear();

foreach (BackerEntry backerEntry in backersTemp)
{

<p>Doing it that way is the only way I can seem to get NHibernate to see that these children really belong to this parent. Inside my AddChild method looks like this: </p>

{

  {
    backerEntry.Backer.BackerEntries.Remove(backerEntry);
  }
  backerEntry.Backer = this;
  this.BackerEntries.Add(backerEntry);
}
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: I think I may have just realized why - Probably because I am not sending back the Parent property of the child in the JSON. I'm not even sure if that'd be possible, due to the circular nature of the two. Child has a parent (who in json has a child who is the original child who has a parent, etc)... Any ideas?</p>

<p>We have some classes with a number of child collection class properties as well as other properties that may or may not be set depending on usage.  These objects are returned from an ASP.NET .asmx WebService decorated with the ScriptService attribute, so are serialized via JSON serialization when returned by the various WebMethods.</p>

<p>The problem is that the out of the box serialization returns all public properties, regardless of whether or not they are used, as well as returning class name and other information in a more verbose manner than would be desired if you wanted to limit the amount of traffic.</p>

<p>Currently, for the classes being returned we have added custom javascript converters that handle the JSON serializtion, and added them to the web.config as below:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;system.web.extensions&gt;
  &lt;scripting&gt;
    &lt;webServices&gt;
      &lt;jsonSerialization&gt;
        &lt;converters&gt;

      &lt;/jsonSerialization&gt;
    &lt;/webServices&gt;
  &lt;/scripting&gt;
&lt;/system.web.extensions&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But this requires a custom converter for each class.  Is there any other way to change the out of the box JSON serialization, either through extending the service, creating a custom serializer or the like?</p>

@<a href=""#159811"">marxidad</a>:</p>

<p>We are using the DataContractJsonSerializer class in other applications, however I have been unable to figure out how to apply it to these services.  Here's an example of how the services are set-up:</p>

<pre><code>[ScriptService]
public class MyService : System.Web.Services.WebService
{
    [WebMethod]
    public CustomClass GetCustomClassMethod
    {
        return new customClass();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The WebMethods are called by javascript and return data serialized in JSON.  The only method we have been able to change the serialization is to use the javascript converters as referenced above?  </p>

<p>Is there a way to tell the WebService to use a custom DataContractJsonSerializer?  Whether it be by web.config configuration, decorating the service with attributes, etc.? </p>

<p><b>Update</b><br />
Well, we couldn't find any way to switch the out of the box JavaScriptSerializer except for creating individual JavaScriptConverters as above.</p>

<p>What we did on that end to prevent having to create a separate converter was create a generic JavaScriptConverter.  We added an empty interface to the classes we wanted handled and the SupportedTypes which is called on web-service start-up uses reflection to find any types that implement the interface kind of like this:</p>

<pre><code>public override IEnumerable&lt;Type&gt; SupportedTypes
{
  get
  {
    foreach (Assembly assembly in AppDomain.CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies())
    {
      AssemblyBuilder dynamicAssemblyCheck = assembly as AssemblyBuilder;
      if (dynamicAssemblyCheck == null)
      {
        foreach (Type type in assembly.GetExportedTypes())
        {
          if (typeof(ICustomClass).IsAssignableFrom(type))
          {
            yield return type;
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The actual implementation is a bit different so that the type are cached, and we will likely refactor it to use custom attributes rather than an empty interface.</p>

<p>However with this, we ran into a slightly different problem when dealing with custom collections.  These typically just extend a generic list, but the custom classes are used instead of the List&lt;> itself because there is generally custom logic, sorting etc. in the collection classes.</p>

<p>The problem is that the Serialize method for a JavaScriptConverter returns a dictionary which is serialized into JSON as name value pairs with the associated type, whereas a list is returned as an array.  So the collection classes could not be easily serialized using the converter.  The solution for this was to just not include those types in the converter's SupportedTypes and they serialize perfectly as lists.</p>

<p>So, serialization works, but when you try to pass these objects the other way as a parameter for a web service call, the deserialization breaks, because they can't be the input is treated as a list of string/object dictionaries, which can't be converted to a list of whatever custom class the collection contains.  The only way we could find to deal with this is to create a generic class that is a list of string/object dictionaries which then converts the list to the appropriate custom collection class, and then changing any web service parameters to use the generic class instead.</p>

<p>I'm sure there are tons of issues and violations of ""best practices"" here, but it gets the job done for us without creating a ton of custom converter classes.</p>

I prefer to do as much work as possible in my text editor (e text editor) so it is more natural to me to stay in the editor and not switch back and forth to programs like Excel (plus this way I retain portable and ""open"" data).   The idea is that if I record all my tasks in JSON or YAML format then I could easily use IRB (interactive Ruby) or some other interactive programming session to create a work log report for myself.  Also I could use this to generate reports for my clients pretty easily at the end of some particular time period.  </p>

<p>It would nice if the format already exists and that the format has some mechanism for coping with the following problem:  some data that I record should be for ""internal use only"" whereas other data could be safe for ""external"" use.  In other words, one problem I would like to avoid is the trouble of sifting back through text work logs in order to filter items that should not be forward to the client.</p>

A: JSON or YAML seems to have a cleaner syntax than creating something with XML.  Remember I am the one who has to type the log so I am not interested in typing a bunch of extra closing tags.</p>
