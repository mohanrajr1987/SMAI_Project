The Web Browser control is overkill, and does not function well in a service environment, nor does it function well on a system with very tight security constraints.  Is there any sort of free .NET library that will support the printing of a basic HTML page?  Here is the code I have so far, which does not run properly.</p>

<pre><code>public void PrintThing(string document)
{
    if (Thread.CurrentThread.GetApartmentState() != ApartmentState.STA)
    {
        Thread thread =
            new Thread((ThreadStart) delegate { PrintDocument(document); });
        thread.SetApartmentState(ApartmentState.STA);

<p>This works fine when called from UI-type threads, but nothing happens when called from a service-type thread.  Changing <code>Print()</code> to <code>ShowPrintPreviewDialog()</code> yields the following IE script error:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Edit:  I agree that this example is very table-like and an actual table would be a fine choice.  But my ""real"" page will eventually be less table-like, and I'd just like to first master this task!</p>

<p>Also, for some reason, when I create/edit my posts in IE7, the code shows up correctly in the preview view, but when I actually post the message, the formatting gets removed.  Editing my post in Firefox 2 seems to have worked, FWIW.</p>

<p>Now I think it would look much nicer, if the textarea I'm using for the main address details would just take up the area of the text in it, and automatically resize if the text was changed.</p>

<p>Here's a screenshot of it currently.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/XK48E.png"" alt=""ISO Address""></p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<hr>

<p>@Chris</p>

<p>A good point, but there are reasons I want it to resize, I want the area it takes up to be the area of the information contained in it.  As you can see in the screen shot, if I have a fixed textarea, it takes up a fair wack of vertical space.</p>

<p>I can reduce the font, but I need address to be large and readable.  Now I can reduce the size of the text area, but then I have problems with people who have an address line that takes 3 or 4 (one takes 5) lines.  Needing to have the user use a scrollbar is a major no-no.</p>

<p>I guess I should be a bit more specific, I'm after vertical resizing, the width doesn't matter as much.  The only problem that happens with that, is the ISO number (the large ""1"") gets pushed under the address when the window width is too small (as you can see on the screenshot).</p>

<p>It's not about having a gimick, it's about having a text field the user can edit that won't take up unnecessary space, but will show all the text in it.</p>

<p>Though if someone comes up with another way to approach the problem I'm open to that too.</p>

<p>@Orion</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I've modified the code a little because it was acting a little odd, I changed it to activate on keyup, because it wouldn't take into consideration the character that was just typed.</p>

<pre><code>resizeIt = function( ) {
  var str = $( 'iso_address' ).value;
  var cols = $( 'iso_address' ).cols;
  var linecount = 0;
  $A( str.split( ""\n"" ) ).each( function( l ) {
    linecount += 1 + Math.floor( l.length / cols ); // take into account long lines
  } )
  $( 'iso_address' ).rows = linecount;
};

<p>I already saw people hiding selects when opening a popup div, that leads to pretty bad user experience having controls disappearing.</p>

<p>FogBugz actually had a pretty smart solution (before v6) of turning every select into text boxes when a popup was displayed. This solved the bug and tricked the user eye but the behavior was not perfect.</p>

<p>Another solution is in FogBugz 6 where they no more use the select element and recoded it everywhere.</p>

<p>Last solution I currently use is messing up the IE rendering engine and force it to render the absolutely positioned <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> as an ActiveX element too, ensuring it can live over a select element. This is achieved by placing an invisible <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> inside the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and styling it with:</p>

<pre class=""lang-css prettyprint-override""><code>#MyDiv iframe
{
    position: absolute;
    z-index: -1;
    filter: mask();
    border: 0;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 9999px;
    height: 9999px;
    overflow: hidden;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Does anyone have an even better solution than this one?</p>

<p>EDIT: The purpose of this question is as much informative as it is a real question. I find the <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> trick to be a good solution, but I am still looking for improvement like removing this <em>ugly useless tag</em> that degrades accessibility.</p>

"15326","1","","","2008-08-18 22:35:42","","6","24032","<p>Here is the scenario: </p>

<p>I have a table with a margin-bottom of 19px. Below that I have a form that contains some fieldsets. One of them is floated right. The problem is that the margin-bottom is not getting the full 19px in IE7. I've gone through all of the IE7 css/margin/float bugs that I can think of and have tried remedies but have been unsuccessful. I have been googling for a while now and cannot find anything that is helping out. </p>

<p>Here is what I have tried. </p>

<ol>
<li>Wrapping the form or fieldset in an unstyled div. No apparent change.</li>
<li>Nixing the margin-bottom on the table and instead wrapping that with a div and giving it a padding-bottom of 19px. No apparent change.</li>
<li>Nixing the margin-bottom on the table and adding a div with a fixed height of 19px. No apparent change.</li>
<li>Putting a clear between the table and the fieldset.</li>
</ol>

<p>I know there are some others that I am forgetting, but those are the things I have tried out recently. This happens to each fieldset. </p>

<hr>

<p>I am using a reset style sheet and have a xhtml transitional doctype. </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I also have the IE7 web developer toolbar and Firebug. The style information for both browsers says that it has a margin-bottom: 19px; but it clearly is not for IE7.</p>

<p>Note that a responsible web developer does not use fonts that are only available on Windows (and <em>especially</em> ones that are only available on Vista), nor do they use a technology that isn't supported by at least the majority of browsers.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> As several people have pointed out, there's nothing wrong with providing a list of fallback fonts for people who don't have the specific font you use. I do in fact always do this, and didn't mean to suggest that this was wrong.</p>

<p>While my question was badly phrased, what I meant was that a designer should not make too many assumptions about what the client will have available. You should plan for how all users will see your site, not just for people using your own preferred setup.</p>

<p>What we need up first is some text and graphics (a gorgeous design has been created in Dreamweaver), some links (including to existing PDF newsletters for download), and maybe hooking up an existing Blogspot blog. Later (or earlier if it's not hard), we may add mouseover menus to the links, a gallery, a calendar, a few Mapquest hotlinks, and so on.</p>

<p>My question--First, is there any real problem with sticking with HTML and jpegs for the initial site? Second, for the ""later"" part of the site development, what's the simplest we can go with? Third, are there costs in doing this the simple way that will make us regret it down the road? Also, is there a good site/resource where I can learn more about this from a newbie perspective?</p>

All the code is the same on my client, WebHost4Life, and Brinkster, so there's obviously something going on with WebHost4Life.</p>

<p>I'm planning to write an email to them or request technical support, but I'd like to be proactive and try to figure out what could be going on with their end to cause this difference. I did everything I could with my code to turn off Buffering like Page.Response.BufferOutput = False. What server settings could they have implemented to cause this difference? Is there any way I could circumvent it on my own without their help? If not, what would they need to do?</p>

You'll notice in the working version, you get updates with each step, but in the one that doesn't, it sits there for a long time until everything is done and then does all the updates to the client at once ... and that makes me sad :(</p>
