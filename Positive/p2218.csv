<p>Facebook requires that I send a copy of all of my request params hashed with my application secret along with the request in order to verify my authenticity.  The problem is that jQuery wants to generate the name of the callback function itself in order to match the name it gives to the anonymous function you pass in to be called when the data returns. Therefore, the name of the function is not available until <code>jQuery.getJSON()</code> executes and Facebook considers my request to be inauthentic due to a mismatched signature (the signature I send along does not include the correct callback param because that was not generated until <code>jQuery.getJSON()</code> ran).</p>

<p>The only way I can think of out of this problem is to somehow specify the name of my function to <code>jQuery.getJSON()</code> instead of allowing it to remain anonymous. But I cannot find any option for doing so in the jQuery AP.</p>

<pre><code>
        protected override void Render(HtmlTextWriter writer)
        {
            AddAttributesToRender(writer);

            if (UseXfbmlSemantics)
            {
                writer.RenderBeginTag(ElementName);
                writer.EndRender();
                writer.RenderEndTag();
            }
            else
            {
                writer.RenderBeginTag(ElementName);
                writer.RenderEndTag();
            }
        }
</code></pre>

<p>What I would like is for the rendering to be modified based on UseXfbmlSemantics - if it's true, it should render, for instance:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;fb:name uid=""10300399458""&gt;&lt;/fb:name&gt;</code></pre>

<p>When it's false, it should render with a self-closing tag:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;fb:name uid=""10300399458"" /&gt;</code></pre>

<p>I can get the ""true"" condition to work almost correctly, but the self-closing tag seems to be incompatible with the Render- set of methods.  Unfortunately if that's the case it also means that the AddAttributesToRender pattern wouldn't work, either.  What it's actually producing is this:</p>

<pre><code>
        &lt;fb:name uid=""10300399458""&gt;

        &lt;/fb:name&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>How can I get HtmlTextWriter (or which HtmlTextWriter do I need to use) to make it render a self-closing tag?  Or, at the very least, how can I make it not render that interim space (so that the opening and closing tags are immediately next to one another)?</p>

<p>Our basic setup is this</p>

<p>canvas URL = domain.com/facebook</p>

<p>This is a simple page with an FBML Iframe element that points to domain.com/facebook/app which is an HTML page that serves up a Flash Application. </p>

<p>The Flash Application requests additional data from our application server - some of those requests ask for facebook data (such as a list of friend IDs).</p>

<p>So Flash then makes a request to domain.com/resources/facebook/friends - this is a PHP page which creates a Facebook instance (their PHP library) and performs the necessary call to their API and returns the data.</p>

<p>However, the request to this URL (by flash) doesn't validate, so it is then redirected to their login when then itself redirects back my canvas URL with two parameters - <strong>auth_token</strong> and <strong>next</strong>.  So the request is valid, but the redirect breaks the flash call.</p>

<p>So, I'm trying to figure out how to make these other API calls (when themselves mace facebook API calls) be facebook-vaildated from the get-go.</p>

<p>First of all, if you think there is a better way to do this (infinite session maybe?) let me know.</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong>: Found this: ""<a href=""http://nyquistrate.com/django/facebook-connect/"" rel=""nofollow"">Integrating Facebook Connect with Django in 15 minutes</a>"" which uses middleware instead of the django-fbconnect app. I prefer the app because it's lighter and the code is clearer. Also, it sticks to the 'everything is an app' culture of django. but I guess I'll look into this other possibility</p>

<p>When a user logs in, I want to show that users details (refreshed without reloading the page), and when the user logs out, I need to go back to a logged in state. </p>

<p>The code I have is</p>

<pre><code>function update_user_box()
{
   jQuery('span#loggedin').html('&lt;fb:profile-pic uid=""loggedinuser"" facebook-logo=""true""&gt;&lt;/fb:profile-pic&gt;&lt;fb:login-button size=""small"" onclick=""fbLogout()"" autologoutlink=""true""&gt;&lt;/fb:login-button&gt;');
   jQuery('span#fbLogin, ul#otherLogin').hide();
   jQuery('div#popForecast li.otherLogin, ul.showList li.otherLogin').remove();
   jQuery('span#logged').text('1');
   FB.XFBML.Host.parseDomTree();
}

function fbLogout()
{
   FB.Connect.logout();
   jQuery('span#fbLogin').show();
   jQuery('span#loggedin').empty();
   jQuery('span#logged').text('0');
}
FB.init('c0529b8c11709f2317ae643d854e3866', 'xd_receiver.htm');
FB.ensureInit(function(){
   FB.Connect.ifUserConnected(update_user_box);
});
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<p>I can log the user in and out, but nothing else changes. 
I can't even trigger an alert from my functions. </p>

<p>For some reason the html I'm using won't display within the pre tags, however, on reloading the page, the user is displayed (or not as it should), so it is just not being triggered directly from the javascript functions. But refreshing the page launches the correct function. </p>

<p>The error I get in firebug is </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>'fbLogout undefined'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>, but clearly it is defined. Does it matter where I define it?
Currently all of the javascript/jquery is in the head within script tags. Though I've tried moving it down into the page and didn't have luck their either. </p>

Is this provided in some way in the Facebook Toolkit or do i have to do something myself? The <a href=""http://wiki.developers.facebook.com/index.php/Verifying%5FThe%5FSignature"" rel=""nofollow"">documentation</a> is not superclear on how to do this and if it is already baked in the facebook toolkit i don't want to spend to much time on it.</p>

<p>Anyone have done this? Should mention i use a standard ASP.NET Web Application in C#. Any help would be appreciated!</p>
