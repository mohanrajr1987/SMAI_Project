<p>B) Apply a theme to WordPress which followed the look and feel of their existing website.</p>

<p>C) Train my client on how to login to their copy of Wordpress and create/manage pages/posts.</p>

<p>This took me very little time.. Most of the work in converting asp forms into php and tweaking a theme to fit their design.</p>

<p>Now my client is able to create/manage as many pages or posts as they desire.</p>

I really want to put my site into subversion (that's what I'm using right now, maybe git will come later) but I can't think of the correct way to do it yet.  Basically, my repository is set up currently with an 'implementation' directory and a 'resources' directory, with implementation holding what will eventually be published to the live site.  I want to be able to preview my site locally without having to upload to the server for obvious reasons.  However, to do this I found that I needed to actually install Wordpress locally (not just copy the remote site down to my local box).  This was told to me over at Wordpress.org.</p>

<p>This brings up the problem of being able to use SCM with the install because I need to upgrade my local site every now and then but this generates inconsistencies with subversion because it can’t track what’s going on because an external system is messing with it’s repository structure.  That just won’t work.</p>

<p>My initial inclination is to try to just SCM my theme information as this is really the only stuff that I ‘own’ while as everything else is really just part of my platform (no different than Apache or PHP, really).  However, that’s where my understanding breaks down.  How can I selectively SCM only part of that directory structure, and how can I maintain the configuration of Wordpress that I’m on?</p>

<p>Anyway, I’m sure other people have tackled this and the solution is probably applicable to many apps similar to Wordpress (Drupal, phpBB, phpMyAdmin, etc.).  So, how do you do it?</p>

<p>The reasoning being to overcome this limitation:
""Most browser will only make 2 simultaneous requests to a server, so if you page requires 16 files they will be requested 2 at a time.""</p>

<p>In relation to: <a href=""http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Optimization/Offloading"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Optimization/Offloading</a></p>

<p>To further clarify:<br />
There are two plug ins for ""offloading"" that already do this.  They are the SteadyOffloading Plugin and the Amazon S3 plugin.<br />
So is there a generic solution that anyone has come across.  Where it will allow you to change the base URL of the media, it doesn't necessary have to upload that media to an external service/server.</p>

<p>Followup:</p>

<p>My final solution was to integrate bbPress 0.99 with WordPress 2.6.  I have single login, integrated search, and identical styling for both blog comments and forum posts with combined user stats.  </p>

<p>This used the basic integration with WordPress that bbPress 0.99 allowed, and inclusion of several bbPress plugins (<a href=""http://bbshowcase.org/forums/"" rel=""nofollow"">many by _ ck _)</a> that were heavily customized (read mangled) to my liking. The trickiest part was to get the cookies to work between the two.</p>

<p>The only downfall is I can no longer upgrade either WordPress or bbPress without a lot of work. But until those stop working, I'm fine.</p>

Because there is only 50 or so articles, i thought will be a good idea to put a rule for each post (in .htaccess).</p>

<p>Well... Not always things are like you want, so redirects dont work at all :(</p>

<p>Old joomla links looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>http://site.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=49&amp;Itemid=29
http://site.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=42&amp;Itemid=29
http://site.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=68&amp;Itemid=29
</code></pre>

<p>And need to be translated to:</p>

<pre><code>http://site.com/?p=23
http://site.com/?p=24
http://site.com/?p=25
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><p>basically no relations between old and new links, so i don't think a regex will help</p></li>
<li><p>both old and new site are on the same domain</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Ok, the problem is that any rule i've tried (and i tried a LOT!), none worked. in few cases i get 500 error, but most of times the redirect didn't work.</p>

<p>So, any of you guys had same problem? I don't necessary want to have nice permalinks, but if i can, that will be better. The problem is that i have many backlinks to old url's and i don't want to loose them.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot guys!</p>

<li>In WordPress, how do I hide a Page?</li>
<li>How do I then reimplement it as a DIV, let's say, on another Page?</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Context</strong></p>

<p>I'm trying to get some year-end tax write-offs here for my freelance business, and so I'm donating WordPress sites to churches. Now, unfortunately I'm finding that several pastors don't understand computers that well, and even though WordPress is fairly easy to tech guys like you and me, they get a bit confused. Therefore, I commented out Posts, Comments, Plugins, Widgets, Users, Design, and left nothing but Pages (New, Edit, Delete) and Media Gallery. I then took a theme that showed the Pages as tabs at the top like a normal website.</p>

<p>My hope is to call a particular page like Sidebar1 as its title. However, instead of this being displayed as a tab, it will be hidden. Then, it will be reimplemented as a DIV inside the page titled Home. If the pastor accidentally deletes Sidebar1, all he has to do is recreate it again and poof it reappears.</p>

<p>This doesn't deal with the Wordpress website, but the Wordpress installation.</p>

<p>I've changed the admin -- I just need to change the front-end.</p>

<p>I could figure this out on my own, but in the interest of time I wondered if someone had already done this?</p>

<p>Your help could help me get this done just in time for Christmas for some area churches here. Thank you.</p>

I am trying to run a wordpress blog with ""pretty urls"" (removing index.php). The hosting provider doesn't want to install the URLRewrite module, so that option isn't available to me. I found a plugin for wordpress that will remove the index.php from permalink URLs and changing the 404 page to index.php is supposed to do the trick... that isn't working either.</p>

<p>I'm familiar with URL rewriting for an ASP.NET website, but I'm not sure how I would go about it for PHP. The hosting setup seems to support ASP.NET and PHP at the same time, so I'm thinking it would be possible to run the rewrite code through ASP.NET, but I'm not sure how to go about it.</p>

<p>Does anybody have any experience with this or any ideas about the best approach to take. If anything leads me in the right direction or if I figure it out myself, I will be more than happy to share the code here for anybody else that may need it. </p>

"410933","1","411033","","2009-01-04 12:39:18","","0","663","<p>I have a relatively complex .htaccess file to control page requests, this currently redirects all requests of files (with some type exclusions) to an index file, with an exception of one directory that includes a WordPress installation.</p>

<p>I now need to enable the WordPress PermaLink support but I'm having some difficulty modifying the .htaccess to work.</p>

<p>The PermaLinks are required to produce more-SEO friendly URLs, and they are normally taken care of exclusively by WordPress - but it my case, it appears that a mod-rewrite rule, as detailed <a href=""http://perishablepress.com/press/2006/06/14/the-htaccess-rules-for-all-wordpress-permalinks/"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> is required (otherwise, when enabled it gives a 404 response).</p>

<p>Here is the current .htaccess contents:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteEngine ON

RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^www\..*
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST}   !^$
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^([^.]*)\.(co\.uk)
RewriteRule ^.*$     http://www.%1.%2%{REQUEST_URI} [R=permanent,L]

AddHandler application/x-httpd-php .phtml

#RewriteBase /blog/
#RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
#RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
#RewriteRule . /blog/index.php [L]

RewriteBase /
RewriteRule  ^blog/  -  [L]
RewriteRule !\.(js|ico|gif|jpg|JPG|png|css|php|phtml|pdf|txt|xml|swf|flv)$ index.phtml
</code></pre>

<p>The commented out section is where I'm trying and failing to add a rule for the WordPress PermaLink functionality.</p>

<p>Initially, I thought this code was working but in fact some non-WordPress requests are still routed to the blog/index.php file and when trying to follow links out of the blog to other site areas these are again being routed back to the blog index.php.</p>
