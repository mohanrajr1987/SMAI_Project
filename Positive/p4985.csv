<p>I'm currently using the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GD_Graphics_Library"">GD</a> function imagecopyresampled to take high resolution images, and cleanly resize them down to a size for web viewing (roughly 700 pixels wide by 700 pixels tall).</p>

<p>This works great on small (under 2 MB) photos and the entire resize operation takes less than a second on the server. However, the site will eventually service photographers who may be uploading images up to 10 MB in size (or images up to 5000x4000 pixels in size).</p>

<p>Doing this kind of resize operation with large images tends to increase the memory usage by a very large margin (larger images can spike the memory usage for the script past 80 MB). Is there any way to make this resize operation more efficient? Should I be using an alternate image library such as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ImageMagick"">ImageMagick</a>?</p>

<p>Right now, the resize code looks something like this</p>

<pre><code>function makeThumbnail($sourcefile, $endfile, $thumbwidth, $thumbheight, $quality){
// Takes the sourcefile (path/to/image.jpg) and makes a thumbnail from it
// and places it at endfile (path/to/thumb.jpg).

// Load image and get image size.
$img = imagecreatefromjpeg($sourcefile);
$width = imagesx( $img );
$height = imagesy( $img );

if ($width &gt; $height) {
    $newwidth = $thumbwidth;
    $divisor = $width / $thumbwidth;
    $newheight = floor( $height / $divisor);
}
else {
    $newheight = $thumbheight;
    $divisor = $height / $thumbheight;
    $newwidth = floor( $width / $divisor );
}

// Create a new temporary image.
$tmpimg = imagecreatetruecolor( $newwidth, $newheight );

// Copy and resize old image into new image.
imagecopyresampled( $tmpimg, $img, 0, 0, 0, 0, $newwidth, $newheight, $width, $height );

// Save thumbnail into a file.

<p>It is also mentioned that if the image is a multiple 1MCU block (defined as a Minimum Coded Unit, 'usually 16 pixels in both directions') that lossless alterations to a JPEG can be performed. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jpeg#Lossless_editing"" rel=""nofollow"">[source]</a></p>

<p>I am working with product images and would like to know both if, and how much benefit can be derived from using multiples of 16 in my final image size (say, using an image with size 480px by 360px) vs. a non-multiple of 16 (such as 484x362). In this example I am not interested in further alterations, editing, or recompression of the final image.</p>

<p>To try to get closer to a specific answer where I know there must be largely generalities: Given a 480x360 image that is 64k and saved at maximum quality in Photoshop <a href=""http://enstxzrnsprxt.6hops.net/Random_Bill_Blass_Pen_and_Pencil_Set___2_PacklewStandard.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">[example]</a>:</p>

<li>Can I expect any quality loss from an image that is 484x362</li>
<li>What amount of file size addition can I expect (for this example, the additional space would be white pixels)</li>
<li>Are there any other disadvantages to growing larger than the 8px grid?</li>
</ul>

<p>I know it's arbitrary to use that specific example, but it would still be helpful (for me and potentially any others pondering an image size) to understand what level of compromise I'd be dealing with in breaking the non-8px grid.</p>

I think I even encountered it in school many years ago.  But I have been unsuccessful in finding any reference to one in several web searches.</p>

<p>(I have implemented a radial fill pattern in the corner, but the transition is still not smooth enough.)</p>

<p><strong>My questions</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If there is a standard algorithm for
this problem, what is the name of
it, and even better, how is it
implemented?</p></li>
<li><p>Forgoing any standard algorithm,
what's the best way to determine the desired pixel
value to produce a smooth gradient
in the corners? (Make a smooth
transition from the vertical
gradient to the horizontal
gradient.)</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:  So imagine I have an image I will insert on top of a larger image.  The larger image is solid black and the smaller image is solid white.  Before I insert it, I want to blend the smaller image into the larger one by setting the alpha value on the smaller image to create a transparent ""border"" around it so it ""fades"" into the larger image.  Done correctly, I should have a smooth gradient from black to white, and I do everywhere except the corners and the inside edge.</p>

<p>At the edge of the gradient border near the center of the image, the value would be 255 (not transparent). As the border approaches the outside edge, the alpha value approaches 0.  In the corners of the image where the vert &amp; horiz borders meet, you end up with what amounts to a diagonal line.  I want to eliminate that line and have a smooth transition.</p>

<p>What I need is an algorithm that determines the alpha value (0 - 255) for each pixel that overlaps in the corner of an image as the horizontal and vertical edges meet.</p>

<p>Sure, you can do all of these in general graphics editor, but a specialized tool (or plugin for a generic editor) would be so much nicer and should produce more consistent results.</p>

<p>Essentially this:</p>

<p><img src=""http://nhc.hcmuns.googlepages.com/web2_icons.jpg"" alt=""example icons"" /></p>

<p>Now, I see two approaches here: I create one image which has an Alpha channel with the gloss effect, and then I just combine the input and the gloss alpha icon to create this.</p>

<p>The second approach: Create the Alpha Gloss Image in code and then merge it with the input graphic.</p>

<p>I would prefer the second solution, but I'm not much of a graphics person and I don't know what the algorhithm is called to create such effects. Can someone give me some pointers* for what I am actually looking here? is there a ""gloss algorhitm"" that has a name? or even a .net Implementation already?</p>

<p>*No, not <a href=""http://xkcd.com/138/"" rel=""nofollow"">those type</a> of pointers.</p>
