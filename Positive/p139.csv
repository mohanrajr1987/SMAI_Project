This should yield two serialized arrays where the array containing the two-byte characters should have length +1.</p>

What the author doesn't mention, though, is that <code>StringIO</code> is just an ""I.""  There's no ""O.""  You <em>can't</em> do this, for example:</p>

<pre><code>s = StringIO.new
s &lt;&lt; 'foo'
s &lt;&lt; 'bar'
s.to_s
# =&gt; should be ""foo\nbar""
# =&gt; really is ''`
</code></pre>

<p>Ruby really needs a StringBuffer just like the one Java has. StringBuffers serve two important purposes. First, they let you test the output half of what Ruby's StringIO does. Second, they are useful for building up long strings from small parts -- something that Joel reminds us over and over again is otherwise very very slow.</p>

<p>Is there a good replacement?</p>

<p>It's true that Strings in Ruby are mutable, but that doesn't mean we should always rely on that functionality.  If <code>stuff</code> is large, the performance and memory requirements of this, for example, is really bad.</p>

<pre><code>result = stuff.map(&amp;:to_s).join(' ')
</code></pre>

<p>The ""correct"" way to do this in Java is:</p>

<pre><code>result = StringBuffer.new("""")
for(String s : stuff) {
  result.append(s);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I need to search for a phone number in a similarly arbitrary format ( e.g. <code>07123456</code> should find the entry <code>(07) 123 456</code></p>

<p>The way I'd do this in a normal programming language is to strip all the non-digit characters out of the 'needle', then go through each number in the haystack, strip all non-digit characters out of it, then compare against the needle, eg (in ruby)</p>

<pre><code>digits_only = lambda{ |n| n.gsub /[^\d]/, '' }

needle = digits_only[input_phone_number]
haystack.map(&amp;digits_only).include?(needle)
</code></pre>

<p>The catch is, I need to do this in MySQL. It has a host of string functions, none of which really seem to do what I want. </p>

<p>Currently I can think of 2 'solutions'</p>

<ul>
<li>Hack together a franken-query of <code>CONCAT</code> and <code>SUBSTR</code></li>
<li>Insert a <code>%</code> between every character of the needle ( so it's like this: <code>%0%7%1%2%3%4%5%6%</code> ) </li>
</ul>

<p>However, neither of these seem like particularly elegant solutions.<br>
Hopefully someone can help or I might be forced to use the %%%%%% solution</p>

<h3>Update: This is operating over a relatively fixed set of data, with maybe a few hundred rows. I just didn't want to do something ridiculously bad that future programmers would cry over.</h3>

<p>If the dataset grows I'll take the 'phoneStripped' approach. Thanks for all the feedback!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>could you use a ""replace"" function to strip out any instances of ""("", ""-"" and "" "", </p>

<p>I'm not concerned about the result being numeric. 
The main characters I need to consider are <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>(</code>, <code>)</code> and <code>space</code>

<p>No, we're not using it to match duplicate data. We have a list of strings that we are looking for - we call it search-list. And then we need to process texts from various sources (like RSS feeds, web-sites, forums, etc.) - we extract parts of those texts (there are entire sets of rules for that, but that's irrelevant) and we need to match those against the search-list. If the string matches one of the strings in search-list - we need to do some further processing of the thing (which is also irrelevant).</p>

<p>We can not perform the normal comparison, because the strings extracted from the outside sources, most of the times, include some extra words etc.</p>

<p>also I have method which returns value from 0 to 1:</p>

<pre><code>/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Gets the similarity between two strings.
/// All relation scores are in the [0, 1] range, 
/// which means that if the score gets a maximum value (equal to 1) 
/// then the two string are absolutely similar
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
/// &lt;param name=""string1""&gt;The string1.&lt;/param&gt;
/// &lt;param name=""string2""&gt;The string2.&lt;/param&gt;
/// &lt;returns&gt;&lt;/returns&gt;
public static float CalculateSimilarity(String s1, String s2)
{
    if ((s1 == null) || (s2 == null)) return 0.0f;

    float dis = LevenshteinDistance.Compute(s1, s2);
    float maxLen = s1.Length;
    if (maxLen &lt; s2.Length)
        maxLen = s2.Length;
    if (maxLen == 0.0F)
        return 1.0F;
    else return 1.0F - dis / maxLen;
}

<p>but this for me is not enough. Because I need more complex way to match two sentences.</p>

<p>For example I want automatically tag some music, I have original song names, and i have songs with trash, like <em>super, quality,</em> years like <em>2007, 2008,</em> etc..etc.. also some files have just <a href=""http://trash..thash..song_name_mp3.mp3"">http://trash..thash..song_name_mp3.mp3</a>, other are normal. I want to create an algorithm which will work just more perfect than mine now.. Maybe anyone can help me?</p>

<p>here is my current algo:</p>

<pre><code>/// &lt;summary&gt;

/// &lt;/summary&gt;
/// &lt;param name=""targetString""&gt;The target string.&lt;/param&gt;

<p>This works normally but just in some cases, a lot of titles which should match, does not match... I think I need some kind of formula to play with weights and etc, but i can't think of one.. </p>

<p>Ideas? Suggestions? Algos?</p>

<p>Now I know that most programming languages offer some kind of join method for this. I just wonder how these might be implemented.
When I took introductory courses, I often tried to go it alone, but never found a satisfactory algorithm. Everything seemed rather messy, the problem being that you can not just loop through the array, concatenating the strings, as you would add one too many commas (either before or after the last string).
I don’t want to check conditions in the loop. I don’t really want to add the first or the last string before/after the loop (I guess this is maybe the best way?).</p>
