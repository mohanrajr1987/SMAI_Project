This should yield two serialized arrays where the array containing the two-byte characters should have length +1.</p>

<p>OK, following on from my other question on <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6681/aspnet-web-service-results-proxy-classes-and-type-conversion"" rel=""nofollow"">ASP.NET Web Service Results, Proxy Classes and Type Conversion</a>. I've come to a part in my project where I need to get my thinking cap on.</p>

<p>Basically, we have a large, complex custom object that needs to be returned from a Web Service and consumed in the client application.</p>

<p>Now, based on the previous discussion, we know this is going to then take the form of the proxy class(es) as the return type. To overcome this, we need to basically copy the properties from one to the other.</p>

<p>In this case, that is something that I would really, really, <em>really!</em> like to avoid!</p>

<p>So, it got me thinking, <strong>how else could we do this?</strong></p>

<p>My current thoughts are to enable the object for complete serialization to XML and then return the XML as a string from the Web Service. We then de-serialize at the client. This will mean a fair bit of attribute decorating, but at least the code at both endpoints will be light, namely by just using the .NET XML Serializer.</p>

<p>So if you want to add or remove text, you have to move the start/end tags around based on the size of the text on the page. This is pretty impossible without computing the number of words a page can hold, which seems wildly inelegant.</p>

<p>However, to serialize to XML, I am simply decorating the class and its members with the <em>Xml???</em> attributes ( <em>XmlRoot</em> , <em>XmlElement</em> etc.) and then passing it to the <em>XmlSerializer</em> and a <em>StringWriter</em> to get the string. Which is all good. I intend to put the method to return the string into a generic utility method so I dont need to worry about type etc.</p>

<p>The problem I have is that I have a collection, which is of a abstract base class type, which is populated by the concrete derived types.</p>

<p>So I have done some digging on Google and I now understand <em>why</em> it's not working. In that <strong>the <code>XmlSerializer</code> is in fact doing some clever reflection in order to serialize objects to/from XML, and since its based on the abstract type, it cannot figure out what the hell it's talking to</strong>. Fine.</p>

<p>I did come across <a href=""http://www.codeproject.com/KB/XML/xmlserializerforunknown.aspx"">this page</a> on CodeProject, which looks like it may well help a lot (yet to read/consume fully), but I thought I would like to bring this problem to the StackOverflow table too, to see if you have any neat hacks/tricks in order to get this up and running in the quickest/lightest way possible.</p>

<p>One thing I should also add is that I <strong>DO NOT</strong> want to go down the <code>XmlInclude</code> route. There is simply too much coupling with it, and this area of the system is under heavy development, so the it would be a real maintenance headache!</p>

One of the things the I like very much is the XSLT engine, more precisely the extensibility of it. However there one little piece which keeps being a source of annoyance.

<p>One of the things we do is transform nodes inline and importing nodes from one XML document to another. </p>

<p>Sadly , when you save nodes to an <code>XmlTextWriter</code> (actually whatever <code>XmlWriter.Create(Stream)</code>  returns), the namespace definitions get all thrown in there, regardless of it is necessary (previously defined) or not. You get kind of the following xml:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;root xmlns:abx=""http://bladibla""&gt;  
     &lt;abx:child id=""A""&gt;

<p>In <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-DOM-Level-1-19981001/level-one-core.html"">DOM Level 1 Core</a>, Text.splitText is defined as...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Breaks this Text node into two Text nodes at the specified offset, keeping both in the tree as siblings. This node then only contains all the content up to the offset point. And a new Text node, which is inserted as the next sibling of this node, contains all the content at and after the offset point.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Normalise is...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Puts all Text nodes in the full depth of the sub-tree underneath this Element into a ""normal"" form where only markup (e.g., tags, comments, processing instructions, CDATA sections, and entity references) separates Text nodes, i.e., there are no adjacent Text nodes. This can be used to ensure that the DOM view of a document is the same as if it were saved and re-loaded, and is useful when operations (such as XPointer lookups) that depend on a particular document tree structure are to be used.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, if I take a text node containing ""Hello World"", referenced in textNode, and do</p>

<pre><code>textNode.splitText(3)
</code></pre>

<p>textNode now has the content ""Hello"", and a new sibling containing "" World""</p>

<p>If I then</p>

<pre><code>textNode.parent.normalize()
</code></pre>

<p><em>what is textNode</em>? The specification doesn't make it clear that textNode has to still be a child of it's previous parent, just updated to contain all adjacent text nodes (which are then removed). It seems to be to be a conforment behaviour to remove all the adjacent text nodes, and then recreate a new node with the concatenation of the values, leaving textNode pointing to something that is no longer part of the tree. Or, we can update textNode in the same fashion as in splitText, so it retains it's tree position, and gets a new value.</p>

<p>The choice of behaviour is really quite different, and I can't find a clarification on which is correct, or if this is simply an oversight in the specification (it doesn't seem to be clarified in levels 2 or 3). Can any DOM/XML gurus out there shed some light?</p>

<p>When searching for existing standards to use, the only one that looks promising is ODF. But that looks like massive overkill for what I need.

<p>I knew about XSL-FO before, but due to the weight of the spec hadn't really consdiered it. But you're right, a subset would give me everything I need to work with and room to grow. Thanks so much the reminder.</p>
