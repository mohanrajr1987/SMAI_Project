The reason for that is that the current developers are heavy on <strong>Java</strong> but felt the need for a <strong>MVC-style language</strong> for some future web development projects. Personally, I'm coming from the design/usability world, but as I take more ""front-end"" responsibilities I'm starting to feel the need for learning a language more intensively so I can code some logic but especially the front-end code for my UIs and stuff.</p>

<p>I've been trying to get into <strong>Python/Django</strong> personally, but just never invested too much time on it. Now that my company is ""jumping"" into Grails I bought the ""<em>Agile Web Development with Rails (3rd Ed - Beta)</em>"" and I'm starting to get into <strong>RoR</strong>. I'd still like to learn <strong>Python</strong> in the future or on the side, but my biggest question is: </p>

<ul>
<li>Should I be learning RoR, and have a more versatile language in my ""portfolio"", knowing that my RoR knowledge will be useful for my Grails needs as well??</li>
</ul>

<p>-OR-</p>

<ul>
<li>Should I just skip RoR and focus on learning Grails that I'll be needing for work soon, and work on learning RoR/Django (Ruby/Python) later?</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically the question revolves around the usefulness of Grails in a non-corporate setting and the similarities between Rails and Grails. (and this, while trying to avoid the centennial discussion of Python vs Ruby (on Rails) :))</p>

Part of this refactoring, has been to move code that's common to two of my models to a module that I can include where I need it.</p>

<p>So far, so good. Looks like it's going to work out, but I've just hit a problem that I'm not sure how to get around.  The module (which I've called sendable), is just going to be the code that handles faxing, e-mailing, or printing a PDF of the document.  So, for example, I have a purchase order, and I have Internal Sales Orders (imaginatively abbreviated to ISO).</p>

<p>The problem I've struck, is that I want some variables initialised (initialized for people who don't spell correctly :P ) after the object is loaded, so I've been using the <strong>after_initialize</strong> hook. No problem... until I start adding some more mixins.</p>

<p>The problem I have, is that I can have an <strong><code>after_initialize</code></strong> in any one of my mixins, so I need to include a <strong>super</strong> call at the start to make sure the other mixin <strong><code>after_initialize</code></strong> calls get called.  Which is great, until I end up calling super and I get an error because there is no super to call.</p>

<p>Here's a little example, in case I haven't been confusing enough:</p>

<pre><code>class Iso &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  include Shared::TracksSerialNumberExtension
  include Shared::OrderLines
  extend  Shared::Filtered
  include Sendable::Model

  validates_presence_of   :customer
  validates_associated    :lines

  owned_by                :customer
  order_lines             :despatched # Mixin

  tracks_serial_numbers   :items  # Mixin

  sendable :customer                      # Mixin

  attr_accessor :address

  def initialize( params = nil )
    super
    self.created_at ||= Time.now.to_date
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>So, if each one of the mixins have an after_initialize call, with a <strong>super</strong> call, how can I stop that last <strong>super</strong> call from raising the error? How can I test that the super method exists before I call it?</p>

This update happens whenever an associated select tag receives an onchange event.  The problem is, <code>&lt;select onchange=""this.form.submit();""&gt;</code>; doesn't work.  Nor does <code>document.forms[0].submit()</code>.  The only way to get the onsubmit code generated in the form_remote_tag to execute is to create a hidden submit button, and invoke the click method on the button from the select tag.  Here's a working ERb partial example.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;% form_remote_tag :url =&gt; product_path, :update =&gt; 'content', :method =&gt; 'get' do -%&gt;
  &lt;% content_tag :div, :id =&gt; 'content' do -%&gt;
    &lt;%= select_tag :update, options_for_select([[""foo"", 1], [""bar"", 2]]), :onchange =&gt; ""this.form.commit.click"" %&gt;
    &lt;%= submit_tag 'submit_button', :style =&gt; ""display: none"" %&gt;
  &lt;% end %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>What I want to do is something like this, but it doesn't work.</p>

  &lt;% end %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So, is there any way to remove the invisible submit button for this use case?</p>

<p>There seems to be some confusion.  So, let me explain.  The basic problem is that <code>submit()</code> doesn't call the <code>onsubmit()</code> code rendered into the form.</p>

<p>The actual HTML form that Rails renders from this ERb looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form action=""/products/1"" method=""post"" onsubmit=""new Ajax.Updater('content', '/products/1', {asynchronous:true, evalScripts:true, method:'get', parameters:Form.serialize(this)}); return false;""&gt;
  &lt;div style=""margin:0;padding:0""&gt;
    &lt;input name=""authenticity_token"" type=""hidden"" value=""4eacf78eb87e9262a0b631a8a6e417e9a5957cab"" /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div id=""content""&gt;
    &lt;select id=""update"" name=""update"" onchange=""this.form.commit.click""&gt;
      &lt;option value=""1""&gt;foo&lt;/option&gt;
      &lt;option value=""2""&gt;bar&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;/select&gt;
    &lt;input name=""commit"" style=""display: none"" type=""submit"" value=""submit_button"" /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I want to axe the invisible submit button, but using a straight form.submit appears to not work.  So, I need some way to call the form's onsubmit event code.</p>

<p>Update: Orion Edwards solution would work if there wasn't a <code>return(false);</code> generated by Rails.  I'm not sure which is worse though, sending a phantom click to an invisible submit button or calling eval on the <code>getAttribute('onsubmit')</code> call after removing the return call with a javascript string replacement!   </p>

For every request, I get back (among other things) a list of which routes serve the stop in question. For example, if the list includes result for bus route #1, 2, and 5, then I know that those serve this stop.</p>

<p>I have a many-to-many relationship set up between Route and Stop, and I want to dynamically check and update these associations on every request. There is no ""master list"" of which routes serve which stops, so this seems like the best way to get this data.</p>

<p>I believe that the way I'm doing it now is very inefficient:</p>

<pre><code># routes is an array of [number, destination] that I build while iterating over the data
routes.uniq.each do |route|
  number      = route[0]
  destination = route[1]

  r = Route.find_by_number_and_destination(number, destination)

  if !r
    r = Route.new :number =&gt; number, :destination =&gt; destination
    r.save
  end

  # I have to check if it already exists because I can't find a way
  # to create a uniqueness constraint on the join table with 2 foreign keys
  r.stops &lt;&lt; stop unless r.stops.include? stop
end
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, I have to do 2 things for every route I find:
1) Create it if it doesn't already exist, 2) Add a relationship to the current stop if it doesn't already exist.</p>

<p>Is there a better way to do this, for example by getting a bunch of the data in memory and doing some of the processing on the app server side, in order to avoid the multitude of database calls I'm currently doing?</p>

<p>This is a somewhat tricky problem, because there are some class of URLs which are just plain BAD: the /azenv.php bot attacks, the people typing /bar/foo/baz into the URL, etc... we don't want that.</p>

<p>Then there's subtle routing problems, where we do want to be notified:  /artists/ for example, or ///.  In these situations, we may want an error being thrown, or not... or we get Google sending us URLs which used to be valid but are no longer because people deleted them.</p>

<p>In each of these situations, I want a way to contain, analyze and filter the path that we get back, or at least some Railsy way to manage routing past the normal 'fallback catchall' url.  Does this exist?</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>So the code here is: </p>

<pre><code># File vendor/rails/actionpack/lib/action_controller/rescue.rb, line 141

def rescue_action_without_handler(exception)
 log_error(exception) if logger
 erase_results if performed?

 # Let the exception alter the response if it wants.
 # For example, MethodNotAllowed sets the Allow header.
 if exception.respond_to?(:handle_response!)
   exception.handle_response!(response)
 end

 if consider_all_requests_local || local_request?
   rescue_action_locally(exception)
 else
  rescue_action_in_public(exception)
 end
end
</code></pre>

<p>So our best option is to override log_error(exception) so that we can filter down the exceptions according to the exception.  So in ApplicationController</p>

<pre><code>def log_error(exception)
    message = '...'
    if should_log_exception_as_debug?(exception)
      logger.debug(message)
    else
      logger.error(message)
    end
end

def should_log_exception_as_debug?(exception)
   return (ActionController::RoutingError === exception)
end
</code></pre>

<p>Salt for additional logic where we want different controller logic, routes, etc.</p>
