<p>The cookbook form examples on angularjs.org only save the state on the client. How do I submit to the server?</p>

<p>Alternatively, how do I use jQuery's <code>form.submit()</code> on the form in the <code>ng:click=""save()""</code> function?</p>

<li><p><a href=""http://webpac2.rot13.org:3000/conference/Work"">http://webpac2.rot13.org:3000/conference/Work</a> (by Dobrica Pavlinusic) to go the angular way using a resource to send  the data to the server in json format. I had issues with that on the server side - Angular was sending it fine but grails was mangling it (according to firebug and request content-length). I need to look into this more. How do i change the content-type in angular for a resource method like $save() ?</p></li>
<li><p>Put a form in and use a submit button. Since I am not doing a single page web app, I used this method. Most validations were on the client and a few more on the server which were sufficient for me. </p></li>

<p>Just putting this here so that someone else can use this for possible solutions as well as to get the reaction of the javascript/angular experts on the best approach.</p>

<p>I was able to get the data into CKEditor by using a <code>textarea</code> with the <code>name</code> attribute matching my model and a <code>script</code> tag with <code>ng:bind-template</code> to call <code>CKEDITOR.replace</code>.</p>

<p>I then made a CKEditor plugin that detects changes and writes them back to the <code>textarea</code>. The problem is that the <code>textarea</code> looses its event handlers when CKEditor initializes and CKEditor doesn't pickup changes to the <code>textarea</code>. This makes me think that I am approaching this the wrong way.</p>

<p>Next I tried using <code>ng:eval-order=""LAST"" ng:eval=""setupCKEditor()""</code> and setting up the editor from the <code>setupCKEditor()</code> function. This didn't work because even with <code>ng:eval-order=""LAST""</code> the function is still run before the nodes are created.</p>

<p>I have found that adding a <code>setTimeout(function () {...},0)</code> around the <code>CKEDITOR.replace</code> helps. Now the only problem is that when it changes the model it doesn't repaint the screen until another field is edited.</p>

<p><code>scope.$root.$eval();</code> seems to fix that.</p>

<p>I followed the tutorial and had all of my views, controllers, services set up correctly.  However, when I included the js files at the bottom of my index page:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src=""angular/app/lib/angular/angular.js"" ng:autobind&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=""angular/app/js/services.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

<p>... none of the controllers would work.  I would get the <code>{{ model.property }}</code> tags within my templates instead of the actual output.</p>

<p>No Javascript errors in Chrome's dev tools - and network and resources showed all expected files loaded properly.</p>

<p>I thought that maybe I had overlooked something in my code, but when I looked at the developers guide, there is a link to angular's cdn:  </p>

<p>Just for the heck of it, I replaced my local angular.js script call with the cdn, and suddenly everything was working as expected.</p>

<p>I double checked, to make sure that I was loading the local copy from the proper directory, and I was - it's the standard directory that comes with the angular-seed file.  This file was also showing as a resource that was downloaded properly.</p>

<p><strong>Anyone have ideas on why the cdn worked but the local copy would not?</strong></p>

<p>Normally, any server-side framework which support restful service can work with it, but I'm looking for one can work well with it.</p>

<p>In angularjs, we can use a <code>$resource</code> to define a external resource, which has some operations. The code is like:</p>

<pre><code>var User = $resource('/users/:id', {}, {
              get: { method: 'GET'},
              create: { method: 'POST'},
              delete: { method: 'DELETE'},
              resetPassword: { method: 'PUT', params: { reset: passord } }
           });
var user = User.get({id: '123'});
user.delete();
</code></pre>

<p>You can see, the structure of the code is one uri with many operations.</p>

<p>I'm new to server-side js, and just looked a little about <a href=""http://expressjs.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">express</a>. I feel it's not fit angularjs very well.</p>

<p>You can see the demo:</p>

<pre><code>app.get('/', function(req, res){
    res.send('Hello World');
});

app.get('/user/:id', function(req, res){
    res.send('User: ' + id);
});

app.post('/user', function(req, res){
  res.send(req.body);
});
</code></pre>

<p>It separate one uri by <code>http-method</code>s. </p>

<p>I'm looking for a framework, that can let me write the code like:</p>

<pre><code>app.route('/user/:id', {
   get: get(req,res) { ... },
   post: post(req, res) { ... },
   resetPassword: put(req, res) {...}
});

<p>The code is probably wrong, but I think you may know what I mean: It has similar structure as the angularjs' side.</p>

<p>However, the issue is that when Angular detects a change in the model and updates the view using binding, it is setting the value on the original text input which does not cause any sort of event I can bind to to know when to update the plugin's value, since ""change"" only fires due to user input.</p>

<p>Is there a way to modify the default ngModel directive behavior to have it fire an event or run a function I specify when it is processing bindings, specifically from model to view?</p>

<p>The thing I'm trying to name is the view plus the controller, over the model of a single object.  I don't even know what to call it.  For things I know ahead of time I'm going to need, I've been creating <em>directives</em>, but what do you call one instance of the thing that a directive creates?</p>

<p>I have several situations where all of a sudden (in response to some external event), I have a new object in the model and I want to show it on the screen.  Angular seems to want me to list all the possible views <em>ab initio</em> in their parent view, but that isn't really reasonable in my case.  How, for example, would I list all the pop-ups and tool-tips and other stuff.</p>

<p>I'm down in some little edge case, deep in the controller code, and it needs to add something to the current view.  What's the accepted practice.</p>

<p>Incidentally, the $route/ng-view is one case of exactly this.  The view containing the ng-view, and the ng-view DIV itself, have no idea what the $route module is going to put in the ng-view.  I need the more general case of this strategy.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>People keep asking for an example.  How about this:  I'm making an equipment-requisition app.  When a user asks that one of the 1000 different type of equipment be sent to him, I need to display a pop-up that gathers addition information specific to that type.  If he asks for a screwdriver, the pop-up will ask about blade size, neck length, and handle composition; if he asks for an airplane, it will be a wizard ask him about engine size, fuel tanks, seating arrangement.  All the app knows on start-up is the list of all equipment types, and the name of the UI element that gathers all subsequent information about each particular type.</p>

  $scope.contacts = Contacts.index();  

  $scope.addContact = function() {

    $scope.contact = Contacts.get( {contact_id: $routeParams.contact_id} ); 
}

ContactDetailCtrl.$inject = ['$scope', '$routeParams', 'Contacts'];
</code></pre>

<p><strike>I am now receiving the error: Unknown Provider for Contacts.  Here is a screenshot of the error</strike></p>

<p>Ok, I managed to fix that error by providing a <strong>ngResource</strong> to the main App file.  Here's what it looks like:</p>

<pre><code>// main app javascript file

'use strict';

angular.module('contactapp', ['ngResource']).
  config(['$routeProvider', function($routeProvider) {
  $routeProvider.
      when('/contacts', {template: 'assets/app/partials/contact-list.html',   controller: ContactListCtrl}).
      when('/contacts/new', {template: 'assets/app/partials/new-contact.html',   controller: ContactListCtrl}).
      when('/contacts/:contact_id', {template: 'assets/app/partials/contact-detail.html', controller: ContactDetailCtrl}).
      otherwise({redirectTo: '/contacts'});
}]);
</code></pre>

<p><strike>I am receiving a new error:  <strong>WARNING: Can't verify CSRF token authenticity</strong></strike></p>

<p>Alright, managed to fix that problem too by adding a callback to the API controller:
<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10167956/rails-shows-warning-cant-verify-csrf-token-authenticity-from-a-restkit-post"">Rails shows &quot;WARNING: Can&#39;t verify CSRF token authenticity&quot; from a RestKit POST</a></p>

<p><strike><strong>Now I am back to the original problem.  When the create method is called, a new row is saved to the database, but the models data is not.</strong></strike></p>

<p><strong>Awesome... finally got this thing working.</strong></p>

<p>The problem was the <strong>$scope.addContact</strong> function.  It was using the 'name' of the input instead of the <strong>ng-model</strong> binding called 'newFirstName' and 'newLastName' that resides in the template.</p>

<p>Here's what the updated function looks like:</p>

        var nc = new Contacts({ contact: newContact });

        nc.$create(function() {

<p>There's a lot of boilerplate code in there, that I'd like to reduce to a new directive - form-input, like follows:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form-input label=""Name"" form-id=""nameInput""&gt;&lt;/form-input&gt;

<p>generates:</p>

<p>I have this much working via a simple template.</p>

<pre><code>angular.module('formComponents', [])
    .directive('formInput', function() {
        return {
            restrict: 'E',
            scope: {
                label: 'bind',
                formId: 'bind'
            },
            template:   '&lt;div class=""control-group""&gt;' +
                            '&lt;label class=""control-label"" for=""{{formId}}""&gt;{{label}}&lt;/label&gt;' +
                            '&lt;div class=""controls""&gt;' +
                                '&lt;input type=""text"" class=""input-xlarge"" id=""{{formId}}"" name=""{{formId}}""&gt;' +
                            '&lt;/div&gt;' +
                        '&lt;/div&gt;'

        }
    })
</code></pre>

<p>However it's when I come to add in more advanced functionality that I'm getting stuck.</p>

<h2>How can I support default values in the template?</h2>

<p>I'd like to expose the ""type"" parameter as an optional attribute on my directive, eg:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form-input label=""Password"" form-id=""password"" type=""password""/&gt;&lt;/form-input&gt;
&lt;form-input label=""Email address"" form-id=""emailAddress"" type=""email"" /&gt;&lt;/form-input&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>However, if nothing is specified, I'd like to default to <code>""text""</code>.  How can I support this?</p>

<h2>How can I customize the template based on the presence / absence of attributes?</h2>

<p>I'd also like to be able to support the ""required"" attribute, if it's present.
Eg:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form-input label=""Email address"" form-id=""emailAddress"" type=""email"" required/&gt;&lt;/form-input&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If <code>required</code> is present in the directive, I'd like to add it to the generated <code>&lt;input /&gt;</code> in the output, and ignore it otherwise.  I'm not sure how to achieve this.</p>

<p>I suspect these requirements may have moved beyond a simple template, and have to start using the pre-compile phases, but I'm at a loss where to start.</p>

<p>I know that it's now necessary to include angular-resource.js as a separate file and inject <strong>ngResource</strong> into the app module like this:</p>

<pre><code>// main app javascript file

'use strict';

angular.module('contactapp', ['ngResource']).
  config(['$routeProvider', function($routeProvider) {
  $routeProvider.
      when('/contacts', {template: 'assets/app/partials/contact-list.html', controller: ContactListCtrl}).
      when('/contacts/new', {template: 'assets/app/partials/new-contact.html', controller: ContactListCtrl}).
      when('/contacts/:contact_id', {template: 'assets/app/partials/contact-detail.html', controller: ContactDetailCtrl}).
      otherwise({redirectTo: '/contacts'});      

}]);
</code></pre>

<p>I also know that when files are minified that the controllers can't tell what their dependencies are unless they are also injected into the controller objects like this:</p>

<pre><code>ContactListCtrl.$inject = ['$scope', '$http', 'Contacts'];
</code></pre>

<p>I've also tried doing it the other way that Angular recommends with bracket notation and passing in a function like this:</p>

<pre><code>var ContactListCtrl= ['$scope', '$http', 'Contacts', function($scope, $http, Contacts) { /* constructor body */ }];
</code></pre>

<p>However, none of this seems to work.</p>

<p>The only way my application could see the resource provided was by turning off asset compression in the Production.rb file, like this: </p>

<pre><code># Compress JavaScripts and CSS
  config.assets.compress = false
</code></pre>

<p>It took several hours for me to figure this out, but I recently saw another Rails + AngularJS app that had the same issue.</p>

<p>Jens Krause came to the same conclusion and explains it on his blog:  <a href=""http://www.websector.de/blog/2012/01/17/fun-with-angularjs-rails-coffeescript-sass-another-cafe-townsend-example/"">http://www.websector.de/blog/2012/01/17/fun-with-angularjs-rails-coffeescript-sass-another-cafe-townsend-example/</a></p>

<p>The whole thing is written in CoffeeScript, using AngularJS for the client-side and NodeJS for the server.</p>

<p>There are several components to the app:</p>

<ul>
<li>An iPad app</li>
<li>An iPhone app (different functionality from the ipad)</li>
<li>A CMS for the apps</li>
<li>A NodeJS server</li>
</ul>

<p>There is tons of shared code between all these, again all written in CoffeeScript.</p>

<p>I'd like a build tool where I can list which app uses what code (much of it shared) and it would build each app's javascript files into a seperate folder.</p>

<p>For example, I would setup a folder called '/compiled/ipad/' which has index.html, and folders for js, css, img, etc.  I would list what compiled coffee files I want thrown into /compiled/ipad/js (some of it from /src/shared/*.coffee, some of it from /src/ipad/*.coffee, etc) and what files I want thrown into /compiled/ipad/css.  I would want it to be able to easily concatenate files how I want, too.</p>

<p>It would also compile my tests, from /src/test/ipad into /compiled/test/ipad/*.js.</p>

<p>All my client-side unit tests are written using <a href=""https://github.com/vojtajina/testacular"">testacular</a> and I'm not sure what I'll write the server-side unit tests in yet.</p>

<p>What build tool/configuration is the best approach here?  A Makefile? Something like Grunt? I'm honestly new to the whole build scene.</p>

<p>So in my project I draw using SVG &amp; RaphaelJS several widgets on a canvas that is placed within the ""holder"" div. I am trying to bind this widgets to data using AngularJS, basically each widget is linked to an object in the CustomController. How can I access the CustomController when I initialize my widgets?</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html lang=""en"" style=""height: 100%;""  ng-app=""myApp""&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;script type=""text/javascript""""&gt;
    $(document).ready(function () {
      var canvas = Raphael('holder', '800', '600');
      var widget1 = new Widget1(params);
      // initialize widgets here, that I need to bind to data using AngularJS
      // I am not able to access the CustomController here when drawing my widgets
    });
  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div id=""holder"" ng-controller=""CustomController""&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;

<p>Is this anyway to achieve data binding on SVG widgets using AngularJS? I am starting to think that this is not the purpose of AngularJS..in this case could you please advise me on how to do this?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>Guys thanks a lot for your answers! The requirement is that the widget accepts user input and I want it not to be placed in the html file (for modularity purposes). So the directive seems to be the primary choice for now. In the link method I would draw the widget using RaphaelJS and I can also draw the editable objects but this way I would not properly use the AngularJS binding mechanism, it would be just watches and event handlers...which seems messy to me. It would have been nice if some way I could've put SVG tags in the template property of the directive and do biding in the template, but that does not seem to be supported. </p>

<p>Do you guys have other ideas on this?</p>

<p>Btw is there any way to apply bindings programatically between a property and a HTML element (eg. textbox) obtained with jQuery?</p>

<p>Regards</p>
