A MSDN article on Instrumentation is <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/x5952w0c.aspx"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/x5952w0c.aspx</a>.

<li>How are you processing the instrumented data?</li>
<li>How are you keeping your UI code clean with this instrumentation logic?</li>

<p>Specifically, I am implementing my UI in WPF, so this will provide extra challenges compared to instrumenting a web-based application.

That said, I feel the technology may provide an easier implementation of instrumentation via concepts like attached properties.</p>

<p>There are two or more object collections of different types. You want to combine them into a single sortable and filterable collection (withing having to manually implement sort or filter).</p>

<p>One of the approaches I've considered is to create a new object collection with only a few core properties, including the ones that I would want the collection sorted on, and an object instance of each type. </p>

<pre><code>class MyCompositeObject
{
    enum           ObjectType;
    DateTime       CreatedDate;
    string         SomeAttribute;
    myObjectType1  Obj1;
    myObjectType2  Obj2;
{
class MyCompositeObjects : List&lt;MyCompositeObject&gt; { }
</code></pre>

<p>And then loop through my two object collectiosn to build the new composite collection. Obviously this is a bit of a brute force method, but it would work. I'd get all the default view sorting and filtering behavior on my new composite object collection, and I'd be able to put a data template on it to display my list items properly depending on which type is actually stored in that composite item.</p>

"27733","1","27854","","2008-08-26 10:51:34","","1","1820","<p>Background: I have a little video playing app with a UI inspired by the venerable Sasami2k, just updated to use VMR9 (i.e. Direct3D9 with DirectShow) and be less unstable.  Currently, it's a C++ app using raw Win32, through necessity: none of the various toolkits are worth a damn.  WPF, in particular, was not possible, due to its airspace restrictions.</p>

<p>OK, so, now that D3DImage exists it might be viable to mix and match D3D/VMR9/DirectShow and WPF. Given past frustrations with Win32's inextensibility, this seems like a good thing.</p>

<p>But y'know, I'm falling at the first hurdle here.</p>

<p>With Win32 I have created (very easily) a borderless window that's resizable, resizes proportionately, snaps to the screen edges, and takes up the whole screen (including taskbar area) when maximized. It's a video app, so these are all pretty desirable properties.</p>

<p>OK, so, how to do the same with WPF?</p>

<p>In Win32, I use:
WM_GETMINMAXINFO to control the maximize behaviour
WM_NCHITTEST to control the resize borders
WM_MOVING to control the snap-to-screen-edges
WM_SIZING to control the resize aspect ratio</p>

<p>However, looking at WPF it seems that the various events arrive too late, unless I'm misunderstanding the documentation?</p>

<p>For example, I don't know when I'm mid-move, as LocationChanged says it fires only once the window has moved (which is too late).
Similarly, it appears that StateChanged only fires once the window has been restored/maximized (when I need the information prior to the maximize, to tell the system the correct maximize size).</p>

<p>And I seem to be completely overlooking where the system tells me about resizes. Likewise the hit testing.</p>

<p>So, uh, am I missing something here, or do I have no choice but to drop back to hooking the wndproc of this thing anyway?  Can I do what I want without hooking the WndProc?</p>

<p>If I have to use the WndProc I might as well stick with my existing codebase; I want to have simpler, cleaner UI code, and moving away from the WndProc is fundamental to this.</p>

<p>If I do have to hook the WndProc, I have to wonder--<em>why</em>?  Win32 has got the sizing/sized, moving/moved, poschanging/poschanged window messages, and they're all useful.  Why wouldn't WPF replicate the same set of events?  It seems like an unnecessary gap in functionality.</p>

<p>Plus, it means that WPF is tied to a specific USER32-dependent implementation.  This means that MS can't (in Windows 7 or 8, say) invert the display layer to make WPF ""native"" and emulate HWNDs and WndProcs for legacy apps--even though this is precisely what MS should be doing.</p>

<li><p>So basically, have you rethought the design of your business apps as you move to Web/WPF/Silverlight designs, because for us at least - in winforms we kept things fairly functional and uniform, or are you trying to keep that ""known"" UI?</p></li>
<li><p>Would a dedicated design guy (for larger teams), or a dev with more design chops rank higher when looking at hiring these days?

<p>Is there a similar method I can use in WPF for a ComboBox?</p>

<p>Here's the scenario.</p>

<p>I have a table called RestrictionFormat that contains a column called RestrictionType, the type is a foreign key to a table that stores these values.</p>

<p>In my editor application I'm writing, when the user selects the RestrictionFormat from a ComboBox (this works fine), I'm pulling up the details for editing. I'm using a second ComboBox to make sure the user only selects one RestrictionType when editing. I already have the second combobox bound property from the RestrictionType table, but I need to change the selected index on it to match the value specified in the record.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;TextBox Text=""{Binding Height, UpdateSourceTrigger=PropertyChanged,

<p>Configured this way, any non-empty strings which cannot be converted to decimal result in a validation error which will immediately highlight the textbox. However, the TextBox can still lose focus and remain in an invalid state. What I would like to do is either:</p>

<ol>
<li>Not allow the TextBox to lose focus until it contains a valid value.</li>
<li>Revert the value in the TextBox to the last valid value.</li>

<p>I've found a way to do #2. I don't love it, but it works:</p>

<pre><code>private void TextBox_LostKeyboardFocus(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{

    var binding = box.GetBindingExpression(TextBox.TextProperty);
    if (binding.HasError)

I've created a simple desktop application in C# 3.0 to learn some C#, wpf and .Net 3.5.
My application essentially reads data from a csv file and stores it in a SQL server CE database. I use sqlmetal to generate the ORM code for the database.
My first iteration of this app is ugly as hell and I'm in the process of refactoring it.</p>

<p>Which brings me to my question. How would you architect a dekstop databse app in C#?
What are the best practices?</p>

<p>Do you create a Database Abstraction Layer (DAL) which uses the sqlmetal generated code? Or is the generated code enough of an abstraction?</p>

<p>If you use DAL pattern, do you make it a singleton or a static member?
Do you use the View-Model-ModelView pattern with the DAL pattern?</p>

<p>Apologies if this seems like a long open ended question, but I have been giving this a lot of thought recently.
I see a lot of examples on how to architect an enterprise n-tier app in C# but not that many on architecting standalone desktop apps.</p>

<p>I need to design a control which displays a line chart.  What I want to be able to do is use a designer to add multiple <code>Pens</code> which actually describe the data and presentation so that it ends up with Xaml something along these lines:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Chart&gt;
  &lt;Pen Name=""SalesData"" Color=""Green"" Data=""...""/&gt;
  &lt;Pen Name=""CostData"" Color=""Red"" Data=""..."" /&gt;
  ...
&lt;/chart&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>My first thought is to extend <code>ItemsControl</code> for the <code>Chart</code> class.  Will that get me where I want to go or should I be looking at it from a different direction such as extending <code>Panel</code>?</p>

<p>The major requirement is to be able to use it in a designer without adding any C# code.  In order for that to even be feasible, it needs to retain its structure in the tree-view model.  In other words, if I were working with this in Expression Blend or Mobiform Aurora, I would be able to select the chart from the logical tree or select any of the individual pens to edit their properties.</p>
