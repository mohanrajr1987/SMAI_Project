<p>@<a href=""#78866"" rel=""nofollow"">Joel</a>: I've used <code>pSheet-&gt;UsedRange</code> to determine the row to scroll past, and Excel does scroll past all the horizontal breaks, but I'm still having the same issue when I try to access the second one.

<p><strong>background</strong></p>

<p>basically, our customer is requiring a large volume of verbose data from their users. unfortunately, our customer cannot require any kind of db export from their user. so our customer must supply some sort of UI for their user to enter the data. the UI our customer decided would be acceptable to all of their users was excel as it has a reasonably robust UI. so given all that, and our customer needs this data parsed and stored in their db automatically.</p>

<p>we've tried to convince our customer that the users will do this exactly once and then insist on db export! but the customer can not <em>require</em> db export of their users.</p>

<ul>
<li>our customer is requiring us to parse an excel file</li>
<li>the customer's users are using excel as the ""best"" user interface to enter all the required data</li>
<li>the users are given blank excel templates that they must fill out
<ul>
<li>these templates have a fixed number of uniquely named tabs</li>
<li>these templates have a number of fixed areas (cells) that must be completed</li>
<li>these templates also have areas where the user will insert up to thousands of identically formatted rows</li>
</ul></li>
<li>when complete, the excel file is submitted from the user by standard html file upload</li>
<li>our customer stores this file raw into their SQL database</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>given</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>a standard excel ("".xls"") file (native format, not comma or tab separated)</li>
<li>file is stored raw in a <code>varbinary(max)</code> SQL 2005 field</li>
<li>excel file data may not necessarily be ""uniform"" between rows -- i.e., we can't just assume one column is all the same data type (e.g., there may be row headers, column headers, empty cells, different ""formats"", ...)</li>

<li>code completely within SQL 2005 (stored procedures, SSIS?)</li>

"84978","1","86251","","2008-09-17 16:22:00","","0","7781","<p>Excel usually treats Conditional Formatting formulas as if they are array formulas, <strong>except</strong> when loading them from an Excel 2002/2003 XML Spreadsheet file.</p>

<p>This is only an issue with the Excel 2002/2003 XML Spreadsheet format... the native Excel  format works fine, as does the newer Excel 2007 XML format (xlsx).</p>

<p>After loading the spreadsheet, it is possible to make it work correctly by selecting the formatted range, going to the Conditional Formatting dialog, and clicking OK--but this only fixes the problem for the session.</p>

<p><strong>Test case:</strong></p>

<p>Enter the following into a new sheet:</p>

<pre><code>  A B C
1 N N N
2 x x x
3 x x x</code></pre>

<p>Create this conditional format formula on cells A1:C1 (your choice of pretty colors for the format):</p>

<pre><code>=(SUM(($A1:$C1=""N"")*($A$2:$C$2=A$3))>0)</code></pre>

<p>This is an array formula that activates for A1, B1, and C1 whenever any of them has an ""N"" and the cell in row 2 below the ""N"" is equal to the cell in row 3 of the current column. </p>

<p>(This has been simplified from a real-world business spreadsheet. Sorry for the complexity of the test case, I am trying to find an easier test case to present here.)</p>

<p>And it works... you can alter the N's or the x's in any way you want and the formatting works just fine.</p>

<p>Save this as an XML Spreadsheet. Close Excel, and re-open the file. Formatting is now broken. Now, you can only activate conditional formatting if A1 is an ""N"" and A2 is the same as A3, B3, or C3. The values of B1, B2, C1, and C2 have no effect on the formatting.</p>

<p>Now, select A1:C1 and look at the conditional formatting formula. Exactly the same as before. Hit OK. Conditional formatting starts working again, and will work during the entire session the file is open.</p>

<p><strong>Workarounds considered:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Providing the file in native (BIFF) Excel format. Not an option, these spreadsheets are generated on the fly by a web server and this is only one of dozens of types of workbooks generated dynamically by our system.</p></li>
<li><p>Providing the file in the Excel 2007 native XML format (xlsx). Not an option, current user base does not have Office 2007 or the compatibility plug-in.</p></li>
<li><p>Asking users to select the range, enter the Conditional Formatting dialog, and hitting ok. Not an option in this case, unsophisticated users.</p></li>
<li><p>Asking users to open the XML spreadsheet, save as native XLS, close, and re-open the XLS file. <strong>This does not work!</strong> Formatting remains broken in the native XLS format if it was loaded broken from an XML file. If (3) above is performed before saving, the XLS file will work properly.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>I ended up rewriting the conditional formatting to not use array formulas. So I guess this is ""answered"" to some degree, but it's still an undocumented, if obscure, bug in Excel 2002/2003's handling of XML files.</strong></p>

<p>The main problem is that you can only use the RefEdit control on a VBA UserForm (<a href=""http://support.microsoft.com/kb/q281542/"" rel=""nofollow"">Microsoft states this</a>, and my tests confirm it too).  I'm making an Excel add-in using <strong>Delphi</strong>, and I'm looking for an <strong>alternative to the RefEdit control</strong>.</p>

<p><code>Excel.Application.InputBox Type:=8</code> is one alternative way of selecting a range of cells, but it's not very user-friendly when you need people to select <em>multiple</em> ranges of cells on a single form.  The best real alternative I have at the moment is to call a VBA form from my Delphi add-in, but that's far from ideal.</p>

<p>So ideally I could do with a <em>drop-in replacement for RefEdit</em> - one that I can use on a Delphi form.  If there is one, it's not easy to find (I've been searching pretty hard, and I've not been able to find a drop-in RefEdit replacement for Delphi, VB6, or .NET).</p>

<p>Failing a drop-in replacement I might try cobbling together my own alternative, but I suspect it would be difficult if not impossible to make one that works as well as RefEdit.  RefEdit lets you ""select"" cells without actually selecting them: it uses marching ants around the cells that you choose instead of highlighting them and changing the <code>Excel.Application.Selection</code>.  I don't know of a way to do that by manipulating the Excel object model through VBA, Delphi, or whatever.</p>

<p>Any tips, tricks, hacks, or, if I'm really lucky, pointers to drop-in RefEdit replacements would be most welcome.</p>
