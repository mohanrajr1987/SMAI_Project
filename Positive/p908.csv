<p>Chris - Thanks for your comment but there are many reasons to avoid the standard assert() function for codebases ported to different platforms. If you've gone to the trouble of rolling your own assert it's usually because you have additional functionality (logging, stack unwinding, user-interaction) that you wish to retain.</p>

<p>Your suggestion of attempting to replace the hander via an implementation of '__assert"" or similar is not going to be portable. The standard 'assert' is usually a macro and while it may map to __assert on the Mac it doesn't on other platforms.</p>

Here's what I'm trying to accomplish:</p>

<p>I'd like a static library (""Lib"") to have its own xcodeproj file.  I'd an executable application (""App"") that makes use of Lib to reference Lib's xcodeproj file so that changes to Lib cause App to relink.  Ideally, I'd like to be able to edit Lib's source files inside App's Xcode workspace so I don't have to task around all the time to make changes.</p>

<p>I figured out from the online help that I can simply drag the static lib xcodeproj in to my app's project and it gets the reference.  I see that once my static lib xcodeproj is in my app's project, I can simply drag it to the App's target and it understands that App depends on Lib.  This seems like the right path, but things aren't quite working the way I'd like yet.</p>

<p>Here are my questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It seems that simply having App depend on Lib doesn't cause App to link with Lib.  It seems that I have to explicitly drag libLib.a from the Lib folder into App's ""Link Binary With Libraries"" build stage.  In VS.NET, simply specifying the project as a solution dependency adds it to the link line.  I just want to make sure I'm not missing anything.</p></li>
<li><p>When I have App open in Xcode and I drag Lib.xcodeproj into it, I don't get any of Lib's source files there.  I only get libLib.a under the ""Lib.xcodeproj"" folder.  In VS.NET, I can edit Lib's source files right there and rebuild it, etc... but with this approach in Xcode, changes to Lib.cpp don't cause Lib to rebuild when I rebuild App.  Ideally, I'd get all of Lib's source files and targets to show up when I drag Lib.xcodeproj into App.  Is there any way of doing this?</p></li>

<p>I understand there may be several conventions and habits and think about this question as an aggregator of the best techniques people use dealing with private methods in Objective-C. </p>

<p>Please include an argument for your approach when posting it. Why is it good? Which drawbacks does it have (that you know of) and how you deal with them?</p>

<hr/>

<p>As for my findings so far.</p>

<p>It is possible to use <a href=""http://www.otierney.net/objective-c.html#categories"">categories</a> [e.g. MyClass (Private)] defined in MyClass.m file to group private methods.</p>

<p>This approach has 2 issues:</p>

<ol>
<li>Xcode (and compiler?) does not check if you define all methods in private category in corresponding @implementation block</li>
<li>You have to put @interface declaring your private category in the begin of MyClass.m file, otherwise Xcode complains with a message like ""self may not respond to message ""privateFoo"".</li>
</ol>

<p>The first issue can be worked around with <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjectiveC/Articles/chapter_4_section_5.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001163-CH20-SW2"">empty category</a> [e.g. MyClass ()].<br/>
The second one bothers me a lot. I'd like to see private methods implemented (and defined) near the end of the file; I do not know if that's possible.</p>

"176373","1","","","2008-10-06 21:58:59","","3","2210","<p>We are trying to make a project template, but the documentation on this is spotty or non-existent.</p>

<p>Doing some reverse-engineering on some template files, we have come up with the following.  However, it doen't actually work!</p>

<p>First of all, we have figured out that project templates should be installed inside:</p>

<p>~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Project Templates</p>

<p>We have made project  and installed it here, and this part works - we see this show up in the ""User Templates"" section of the Xcode ""New Project"" chooser.</p>

<p>The project folder contains the following files.  As you can see, I want the file names to be subsituted (that part works) but as you will see, I also want the contents of the files to be substituted; this doesn't happen.</p>

<ul>
<li>___PROJECTNAME___.xcodeproj  </li>
<li>___PROJECTNAMEASIDENTIFIER____Prefix.pch  </li>
<li>___PROJECTNAMEASIDENTIFIER___.icns  </li>
<li>___PROJECTNAMEASIDENTIFIER___Delegate.h  </li>
<li>___PROJECTNAMEASIDENTIFIER___Delegate.m  </li>
<li>___PROJECTNAMEASIDENTIFIER___Template.html  </li>
<li>Debug.xcconfig  </li>
<li>en.lproj  </li>
<li>Info.plist  </li>
<li>Release.xcconfig  </li>
</ul>

<p>I have put in two special files into the ___PROJECTNAME___.xcodeproj package:</p>

<ul>
<li>TemplateInfo.plist  </li>
<li>TemplateIcon.icns - the icon to show up in the New Project window</li>
</ul>

<p>If I create a new project (called ""Foo &amp; Bar"" as a stress test) using this template, these are the files it creates:</p>

<ul>
<li>Debug.xcconfig</li>
<li>en.lproj</li>
<li>Foo &amp; Bar.xcodeproj</li>
<li>Foo___Bar_Prefix.pch</li>
<li>Foo___Bar.icns</li>
<li>Foo___BarDelegate.h</li>
<li>Foo___BarDelegate.m</li>
<li>Foo___BarTemplate.html</li>
<li>Info.plist</li>
<li>Release.xcconfig</li>
</ul>

<p>So far so good!  </p>

<p>But looking in the file contents, I get things like this.  Here is the contents of Foo___BarDelegate.m:</p>

<pre><code>//
//  «PROJECTNAMEASIDENTIFIER»Delegate.m
//  «PROJECTNAME»
//
//  Created by «FULLUSERNAME» on «DATE».
//  Copyright «ORGANIZATIONNAME» «YEAR» . All rights reserved.
//

#import ""«PROJECTNAMEASIDENTIFIER»Delegate.h""


@implementation «PROJECTNAMEASIDENTIFIER»Delegate

@end
</code></pre>

<p>The apparent issue is that somehow I'm doing the TemplateInfo.plist wrong.  But then again, notice how not only are my special items not being substitued, but the standard items don't even get replaced!  So maybe it's a deeper issue.</p>

<p>But with a problematic TemplateInfo.plist being my best hypothesis, I present a couple of variations I have tried.  Neither work.</p>

<p>Either:</p>

<pre><code>{
    FilesToMacroExpand = (
        ""\_\_\_PROJECTNAMEASIDENTIFIER\_\_\_\_Prefix.pch"",
        ""en.lproj/InfoPlist.strings"",
        ""\_\_\_PROJECTNAMEASIDENTIFIER\_\_\_\_Prefix.pch"",
        ""\_\_\_PROJECTNAMEASIDENTIFIER\_\_\_.icns"",
        ""\_\_\_PROJECTNAMEASIDENTIFIER\_\_\_Delegate.h"",
        ""\_\_\_PROJECTNAMEASIDENTIFIER\_\_\_Delegate.m"",
        ""\_\_\_PROJECTNAMEASIDENTIFIER\_\_\_Template.html"",
        ""Info.plist""
    );
    Description = ""This project builds a cocoa-based \""element\"" plugin for Sandvox."";
}
</code></pre>

<p>or:</p>

<pre><code>{
    FilesToMacroExpand = (
        ""«PROJECTNAMEASIDENTIFIER»\_Prefix.pch"",
        ""en.lproj/InfoPlist.strings"",
        ""«PROJECTNAMEASIDENTIFIER»\_Prefix.pch"",
        ""«PROJECTNAMEASIDENTIFIER».icns"",
        ""«PROJECTNAMEASIDENTIFIER»Delegate.h"",
        ""«PROJECTNAMEASIDENTIFIER»Delegate.m"",
        ""«PROJECTNAMEASIDENTIFIER»Template.html"",
        ""Info.plist""
    );
    Description = ""This project builds a cocoa-based \""element\"" plugin for Sandvox."";
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I've also tried adding the ""FilesToRename"" key, even though the ___ seems to be automatically causing renaming to happen.  This is the plist contents with that in, in XML format (since some people were worried about that UTF-8 nature of things -- yes, it's a valid plist):</p>

<p>Specifically, I want to skip the stage where it runs pngcrush on all of my .png files, many of which don't survive the experience in a form which my app can read.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> the version of pngcrush used creates png files which contain a non-standard 'mandatory, private' chunk which explicitly prevents decoding. I've modified my png reader to handle these files, but I'd still like a per-project method of skipping this step. One of the other side effects of pngcrush is that it doesn't save the colour value of transparent pixels, so alpha-ed textures show fringing at smaller mip levels.</p>

<p>The iphone png format is described here: <a href=""http://modmyi.com/wiki/index.php/Iphone_PNG_images"">http://modmyi.com/wiki/index.php/Iphone_PNG_images</a>. In short,</p>

<ul>
<li>Skip the CgBI chunk</li>
<li>Skip the zlib headers</li>
<li>Swap BGR to RGB channel order</li>

able to establish a relationship between a ViewController and a View
window. In as far as a Cocoa Touch Class, I went forward and added a
<code>UIViewController</code> subclass. I made sure that the target is part of the
existing project. Right afterwards I added a User Interfaces -> View
XIB. Within the <code>UIViewController</code> I have some straight forward code I
literally copy/pasted from sample code elsewhere:</p>

<p>EditViewController.h:</p>

<pre><code>@interface EditorViewController : UIViewController &lt;UITextFieldDelegate&gt; {
    UITextField *field;
}

@property(nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet UITextField *field;

- (BOOL)shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation:
         (UIInterfaceOrientation)interfaceOrientation {
   // Return YES for supported orientations
  return (interfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait);
}


- (void)didReceiveMemoryWarning {

}


- (void)dealloc {
   [super dealloc];

<p>As you can tell, it doesn't do much.  Now when I click my new xib, and
reference a class identity with <code>EditorViewController</code>, no auto complete
happens, which to me implies that it has no such awareness of a
<code>EditorViewClass</code>. When I attempt to control+click from the view to
File's Owners, I get nada.</p>

<p>What are some of the possible idiosyncrasies in this process that I'm
overlooking that's not allowing me to outlet my view to a controller?</p>

<p>Am I missing a setting or something somewhere?</p>

<p>I've also read that there are macros available that can augment the debug viewer even further to inspect more complex containers - but have been unable to find any.</p>

<p>I'd also like to be able to view std::wstrings, without having to drop to the memory viewer. It shows std::string fine. Is there anything I can do to show std::wstring?</p>

<p>However, if I use <code>std::wcout</code> I get no output.</p>

<p>I know that this is a thorny issue in C++, and I've been googling around to try and find a specific solution in the XCode case. A couple of things I found that it was suggested should work were:</p>

<pre><code>
    std::cout.imbue( std::locale("""") );
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>
    std::setlocale(LC_ALL, """");

<p>Neither of these have made any difference. Before I resign myself to spending the next couple of weeks studying the facets API just to be able to write to the console I thought I'd check with the esteemed audidence here.</p>

<p>[Update]</p>

<p>I think the reason for the problem I've been having is actually to do with the specific encoding of some of the strings I'm trying to print.</p>

<p>If I send just a string literal, using the <code>L""my string"" syntax</code> it works! It appears this is using UTF32 - little endian encoding.</p>

<p>However, I've been mixing this with strings I've been passed from Objective C++ code using NSUTF32BigEndianStringEncoding encoding. It's this mix of encodings that's causing the problems.</p>

<p>I think we can consider this matter closed. Thanks for reading.</p>
