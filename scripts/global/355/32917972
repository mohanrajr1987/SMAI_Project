<p>Can someone please advise on how to do the validations in WCF datacontract that's present in a different assembly ?</p>  <p>For example below is the datacontract present in another assembly.</p>  <pre><code>[DataContract] public class Employee {     [DataMember]     public string FirstName;      [DataMember]     public string LastName;      [DataMember]     public int Age; } </code></pre>  <p>Now, I would like to create a WCF service with CRUD operations and enable validations on this data contract that's present in a different assembly.</p>
