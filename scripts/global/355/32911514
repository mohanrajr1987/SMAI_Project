<p>So I want to validate the user only enters text and not numbers. If any number is input, then I ask her again for input. I thought this would do the trick, but it doesn't seem to work:</p>  <pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;  using namespace std;  int main() {     string name = "";      cout &lt;&lt; "Enter name: ";     getline(cin, name);      while (!cin) // or cin.fail()     {         cout &lt;&lt; "Numbers are not allowed, input name again: ";         cin.clear();         cin.ignore(1000, '\n'); // is this even necessary since getline() already consumes spaces and new lines?         getline(cin, name);     } } </code></pre>  <p>Because the <code>name</code> variable is of <code>string</code> type, shouldn't the <code>cin</code> object fail when it receives a number? How can I validate it and make sure it prompts for input again when a number is entered? Also, out of curiosity since I'm asking already, if the user enters something like: Scarlett9356, what would be a good way to re-prompt for good input? Thank you.</p>
