<p>I have three certificates and need to verify them with each other. 1 root certificate and 2 leaf certificate.</p>  <p>Trying with this code block:</p>  <pre><code>        bool retVal = false;          X509Chain chain = new X509Chain();          chain.ChainPolicy.ExtraStore.Add(rootCertificate.X509);          chain.ChainPolicy.RevocationMode = X509RevocationMode.NoCheck;          retVal = chain.Build(leafCertificate.X509);          return retVal; </code></pre>  <p>Im getting always false. Cannot find any different way on internet.</p>  <p>Thanks for your helps.</p>
