<p>I'm trying to write a simple C++ program that creates a linked list. I would like to make this list be able to store any type of data in its container. However, I realised that my main problem is being able to accept any type of input and storing it. For example, if the variable <code>std::cin</code> stores to is of type string, only strings will be accepted, and this variable must be defined before program compilation.</p>  <p>My question is: is there any way to accept any type of input with a <code>std::cin</code> (or any other input method) and then call certain functions depending on the input's type?</p>  <p>Something along the logic of...</p>  <pre><code>cin &gt;&gt; data  if (data.type == string) {     cout &lt;&lt; "data's type: string" }  if (data.type == int) {     cout &lt;&lt; "data's type: int" } </code></pre>  <p>Thank you!</p>
