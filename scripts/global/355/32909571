<p>Is there a tutorial or example for building a form with ZF2 and Doctrine that can update more than one record at a time?</p>  <p>For example, let's say that we want to create a form in the Album module that lists a group of albums and each album in the list has a check box for a new field called "favorites."  How do we configure the form and the controller to update each of the records where the user checked the box, perhaps triggered by an event like pressing an update button?</p>
