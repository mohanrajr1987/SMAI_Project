<p>I am trying to install libssl-dev on ubuntu 14.04 using sudo apt-get install libssl-dev. The installation completes. However during compilation i get error </p>  <pre><code>/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lssh2 collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status </code></pre>  <p>I have used libssl-dev previously and i didn't get this error. I have tried to search for libssl.so using <code>locate libssl.so</code> and i get the following directories:</p>  <pre><code>/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libssl.so.1.0.0 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libssl.so </code></pre>  <p>I have tried to link these libraries using <code>-L /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ -lssh2</code>  during compilation. However the compiler still cannot find ssh2. What is not working?</p>
