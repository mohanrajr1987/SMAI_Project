<p>I have Ubuntu 12.01 with gcc 4.8.2 and would like to cross compile for the Vortex86DX CPU running an old 2.6.23 kernel.</p>  <p>I´m trying the following testing code:</p>  <pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;  int main() {    std::cout &lt;&lt; "Hello world" &lt;&lt; std::endl; } </code></pre>  <p>That is compiled using the following command line:</p>  <pre><code>g++ -static-libgcc -static-libstdc++ -march=i586 test.cpp -otest586 </code></pre>  <p>When I run the test586 on the target architecture I´m getting this error:</p>  <pre><code>$ ./test586 ./teste586: symbol lookup error: ./test586: undefined symbol: _ZMSbIwSt11char_traitsIwESaIwEE4_Rep20_S_empty_rep_storageE </code></pre>  <p>Any ideas of what is going on here ? This is just a small code - the real code has around 10 different libraries all written in C++ 11.</p>  <p>Help appreciated.</p>  <p>EDIT:</p>  <p>In fact the comment from Marco was right. The code still need some dynamics libraries:</p>  <pre><code>$ ldd ./test586 linux-gate.so.1 =&gt;  (0xb776b000) libc.so.6 =&gt; /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0xb75a4000) /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0xb776e000) </code></pre>  <p>I have to avoid <em>all</em> dynamic library as the target system either does not have them or will have in a very old version. </p>  <p>Help appreciated to accomplish that.</p>
