<p>I'm making a list to store the content of a text file, but when I compile the code, it shows me a 'SIGSEGV - Segmentation fault' when I check if the list is empty. I check is the list is empty like this: </p>  <pre><code>typedef Figura *pfigura;  pfigura primero;   bool listaVacia() { return primero == NULL;} </code></pre>  <p>I added the  first two lines to help you understand the context, the third line is where the error comes out.</p>  <p>The weird thing is that I tested the code in another machine, and it compiled right away, could it be something related to the RAM?</p>  <p>Please comment if you need the whole code.</p>
