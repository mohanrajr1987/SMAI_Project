<p>I have several .h/.cpp files, each of these ought to have files called "common.h / common.cpp" as I re-use its definitions in the rest of my files. The common.h file defines some intentionally global variables. </p>  <p>I work under Linux and gcc 4.4.7. </p>  <p>Compuler does job OK, but g++ linker complains for many cases like:</p>  <pre><code>build/Debug/GNU-Linux-x86/StoreData2/spacewx.o:(.data+0x200): multiple definition of `nmdata::names` build/Debug/GNU-Linux-x86/StoreData2/StoreData2.o:(.data+0x200): first defined here </code></pre>  <p>and as such I am not getting a successfull build. Please advice how to get rid of this error, and keep these global variables. I only use functional programming (using C++ libraries such as boost) and no own namespaces/objects so far.</p>
