<p>I've created a fresh droplet on digitalocean, deployed my docker container, tested the endpoint via <code>curl ip:dockerPort</code> from my local computer and everything went fine.</p>  <p>Later on i've connected to another test machine via ssh and tried to connect to digital ocean via <code>curl ip:dockerPort</code> as well but got an <code>couldn't connect to host</code> error. I've connected from my test machine to digitalocean droplets in the past. Do i have to wait for the DNS even if i'm using <code>curl ip:port</code>?</p>  <p>EDIT: pinging the server from the test machine works well:<br> <code>8 packets transmitted, 8 packets received, 0.0% packet loss</code></p>
