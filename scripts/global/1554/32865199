<p>The goal:</p>  <p>I have a URL of an image. I would like to get the image file and to upload it to <code>$_FILES</code> as if the image was uploaded by a client.</p>  <p>The reason:</p>  <p>I need this because I have a form in which users can either upload an image file in a <code>input type="file"</code> field OR enter an image URL in a <code>input type="text"</code> field and later, when I validate the form, I want the validation function to access the file using <code>$_FILES</code> regardless the method the user chose to supply the image (either by uploading a file or by entering a file URL.)</p>  <p>The problem:</p>  <p>I found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/724391/saving-image-from-php-url">this</a> answer on using <code>file_put_contents()</code> and <code>file_get_contents()</code> but I don't understand if I can use it to change <code>$_FILES</code> and if yes then how.</p>  <p>EDIT:</p>  <p>After reading David's comment, I understood my mistake. What I actually need is a way to download a file from a URL using <code>file_get_contents()</code> and <code>file_put_contents()</code> to the same temporary location on the server that uploaded files are downloaded to. By that I would be able to handle files the same way regardless of how they got there (URL or file upload).</p>
