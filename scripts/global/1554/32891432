<p>Specifically I am looking to update the URLs that are to be scraped. Documentation can be found here: <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com/apidocs#SetCrawlUrls" rel="nofollow">https://www.kimonolabs.com/apidocs#SetCrawlUrls</a></p>  <p>Unfortunately my knowledge about cURL and RESTful APIs is limited to say the least. My most recent failed attempt was:</p>  <pre><code>$ch = curl_init("https://kimonolabs.com/kimonoapis/"); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, array('Content-type: application/json', 'kimonoapis/$api_id/update')); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $data) curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true); $response = curl_exec($ch); $info = curl_getinfo($ch); curl_close($ch); </code></pre>  <p>where $data is an array of:</p>  <pre><code>array(2) {   ["apikey"]=&gt;   string(32) "API_KEY"   ["urls"]=&gt;   array(2) {     [0]=&gt;     string(34) "URL 1"     [1]=&gt;     string(34) "URL 2"   } } </code></pre>  <p>I have also tried variations of json_encode, passing the parameters in the query string, and different variations of cURL but have not be successful thus far. How do you successfully take advantage of their RESTful API?</p>
