<p>In the janus project, they use curl to download and pipe a bootstrap script into bash. <a href="https://github.com/carlhuda/janus" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/carlhuda/janus</a></p>  <p>It looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>$ curl -Lo- https://bit.ly/janus-bootstrap | bash </code></pre>  <p>Why would one want to use the args <code>-Lo-</code>? </p>  <p>-o is supposed to be for output, but wouldn't that happen anyway (i.e. to stdout)?</p>
