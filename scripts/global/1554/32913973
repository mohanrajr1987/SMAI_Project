<p>Mac 10.8.5</p>  <p>I thought I'd downloaded and installed the latest version of curl (7.44.0) like so:</p>  <ol> <li>Downloaded the latest source archive (.tar.gz)</li> <li>Put it into a new folder on my desktop and <code>cd</code>'d to that folder</li> <li>Expanded the tar file: <code>tar -xvf curl-7.44.0.tar</code> then <code>cd</code>'d into the newly created "curl-7.44.0" subdirectory</li> <li>Did <code>./configure</code>, <code>make</code>, <code>make test</code> (99% success rate), and <code>sudo make install</code></li> </ol>  <p>I see that there are indeed header files in /Usr/local/include/curl and the libraries are at /Usr/local/lib/libcurl.a and /Usr/local/lib/libcurl.dylib . </p>  <p>Yet when I run <code>curl --version</code> it spits out 7.24.0 (the version that came with my computer):</p>  <pre><code>curl 7.24.0 (x86_64-apple-darwin12.0) libcurl/7.24.0 OpenSSL/0.9.8y zlib/1.2.5 </code></pre>  <p>What still needs to be done, or what's the proper, easiest way to update curl on a Mac?</p>  <p><strong>Edit:</strong> What's the proper way to check the current version of curl installed?</p>
