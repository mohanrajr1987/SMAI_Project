<h1>1: According to another post on SO:</h1>  <p>'-k/--insecure will "only make" curl skip certificate validation, it will not turn off SSL all together.'</p>  <p>If I am using SSL with curl, I still need a certificate file to figure out how to decrypt the message. SSL without a certificate file will never work. --insecure just means to blindly trust that the certificate file is valid.</p>  <p>Is that correct?</p>  <h1>2: Chrome 'magically' recognizes certificates, curl does not.</h1>  <p>Sites that work in Chrome don't work thru curl unless you use --cacert. I am guessing that's because certificates are a function of the application (browser) and not the OS.</p>  <p>Is that correct?</p>
