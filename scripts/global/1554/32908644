<p>I tried a multipart file upload to a service running on localhost:</p>  <pre><code>curl -XPOST -F filedata=@Update-2.6.2.zip http://127.0.0.1:9000/api/v1/media -v -o /tmp/upload_result </code></pre>  <p>The upload was quite slow, stalled at 100kB/s.</p>  <p>As it seems, cURL has rate limited that transfer automatically, since when using <code>--limit-rate 2m</code> as an additional option, the transfer only took a few seconds at almost exactly 2MB/s speed.</p>  <p>Where does this rate-limit come from and why?</p>  <p>Is it possible to turn that off?</p>
