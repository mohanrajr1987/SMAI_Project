<p>What does curl do differently to wget? I am trying to access a secure webpage through the url using</p>  <pre><code>https://username:password@website.com </code></pre>  <p>However this doesn't seem to get me straight through to the page. If I try the same url with wget </p>  <pre><code>wget https://username:password@website.com </code></pre>  <p>I get an <code>ERROR 403: Forbidden</code>. If I try the same command with curl</p>  <pre><code>curl https://username:password@website.com </code></pre>  <p>The request is successful. What are the two commands doing differently? I would like to do whatever curl does, but from a browser url.</p>
