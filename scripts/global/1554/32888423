<p>we have a curl command :</p>  <pre><code>curl -k --data-binary @Requests\SOMA_backupscript.xml       -u user2:H@rsha1987 https://x.x.x.x:5550/service/mgmt/current &gt; Response\Resp.xml </code></pre>  <p>the only thing that will change is the host name : x.x.x.x</p>  <p>how to have a python function that do the same and generate a file called Resp.xml in a directory called Response ?</p>  <p>UPDATE : What this curl do ? It uses a SOMA script to reset a value in xml object pointed by this host and generate the xml file. Thanks, your help is appreciated.</p>
