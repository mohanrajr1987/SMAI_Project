<p>I am learning curl to fetch data from a site. Everything works fine with Curl except for special characters. When I look at the source of the site it has following items.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;li class="page_item page-item"&gt;&lt;a href="../categories/mens-health/"&gt;Men&amp;#8217;s Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li class="page_item page-item"&gt;&lt;a href="../categories/nails-hair-skin/"&gt;Nails, Hair &amp;#038; Skin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li class="page_item page-item"&gt;&lt;a href="../categories/womens-health/"&gt;Women’s Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;   </code></pre>  <p>When I get the data in array and echo it on browser I get the result as </p>  <pre><code>Men&amp;#8217;s Health   Nails, Hair &amp;#038; Skin   Women’s Health </code></pre>  <p>which I got by executing the following code  </p>  <pre><code>$search = array('&amp;#146;'); $replace = array("'");   $category_names[] = htmlentities(str_replace($search, $replace, $word), ENT_QUOTES); </code></pre>  <p>$word being the 3 array items above. Now I am not able to convert them to proper characters while inserting into database. This is how it appears in my db  </p>  <pre><code>Men&amp;amp;#8217;s Health Nails, Hair &amp;amp;#038; Skin Women&amp;rsquo;s Health </code></pre>  <p>How can I insert it in proper format as follows?<br> Men's health<br> Nails. Hair &amp; Skin<br> Women's Health  </p>  <p>I checked some of the solutions for having apostrophe but they are mostly single insert statements, where as I am inserting in a loop.  </p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8336812/way-to-insert-text-having-apostrophe-into-a-sql-table">Way to insert text having &#39; (apostrophe) into a SQL table</a><br> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1586560/how-do-i-escape-a-single-quote-in-sql-server">How do I escape a single quote in SQL Server?</a>  </p>  <p>I did html_entity_decode($category_names[$i]); and now I get the following reult in my database<br>     Menâ€™s Health<br>     Nails, Hair &amp; Skin<br>     Womenâ€™s Health</p>
