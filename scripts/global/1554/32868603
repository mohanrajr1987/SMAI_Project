<p>I have a question I am trying to have curl upload a file using ftp to a server.  The syntax below works when I run in manually it works but when I have cron run it I see no attempts on my logs in my ftp server with an attempt.  Can someone let me know what I am missing? thx</p>  <pre><code>## Backup ## */5 * * * * /usr/bin/curl -T $HOSTNAME"_""`date +"%m%d%y"`.txt" ftp://192.168.1.100/FTP-ROOT/ --user cookie:cookie &gt;&gt; /var/tmp/ftp_log </code></pre>
