<p>I'm trying to access Sharepoint 2013 Cloud REST Web Services using the CURL command-line utility (<a href="http://curl.haxx.se/" rel="nofollow">http://curl.haxx.se/</a>).</p>  <p>I've tried the following (they are just a representative sample, since I've tried more), both with http and https for the endpoint. However, all the time, I get nothing returned in the command-line. Has anyone been able to do what I've been trying to do?</p>  <pre><code>curl --ntlm --user user:pass https://site/_api/web/lists  curl --ntlm --user user:pass https://site/_api/web/lists/getbytitle('list_name')/fields  curl --ntlm --user user:pass https://site/_api/web/lists(guid'4063a83c-03d7-4165-b9cc-57afe8dea513') </code></pre>
