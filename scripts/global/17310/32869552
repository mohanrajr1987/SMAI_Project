<p>I recently started studying Java and came across a problem while testing out something. This might be a very easy question, but I can't seem to solve it. This is my code:</p>  <pre><code>    int firstj = 1;      if (firstj == 1) {         String choice = "Type a number between 1 and 4";         System.out.println(choice);         while (true) {              if (firstj == 1) {                 Scanner third = new Scanner(System.in);                 String thirdch = third.nextLine();                  while (true) {                      if (thirdch.equals("1")) {                         System.out.println("Show choice and accept input again ");                         System.out.println(choice);                         break;                     } else if (thirdch.equals("2")) {                         System.out.println("Show choice and accept input again ");                         System.out.println(choice);                         break;                     } else if (thirdch.equals("3")) {                         System.out.println("Show choice and accept input again ");                         System.out.println(choice);                         break;                     }                      else if (thirdch.equals("4")) {                         // I need this to break the loop and move on to the                         // "Done." string                         break;                     }                      else {                         System.out.println("Type a number between 1 and 4");                         thirdch = third.nextLine();                     }                 }              }         }     }     String done = "Done";     System.out.println(done); </code></pre>  <p>I want to make it so that when you type 1, 2 or 3, you get the string telling you to type a number again and accept user input, while when you type 4 the loop breaks and goes to the String done. I would be grateful if you could help me solve this problem with an easy code, since I don't know any of the more advanced things.</p>
