<p>I have to write a program in C that asks the user to enter a range of numbers. ex. 1 4 6 9 5 and finds the largest of them. This would seem simple but I consistently get wrong outputs.</p>  <p>My code I have written so far is:</p>  <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;   main() {     char max;     int count = 0;     char numbers;     printf("Enter a sequence of numbers\n");      max = getchar();     while((numbers = getchar()) != EOF)     {           printf("Max: %d", max);       putchar(numbers);     } </code></pre>  <p>For example, if i input the number 3, I get 3 for the <code>putchar()</code> method, but as my <code>max</code> method, i get 51. Or if I put in 7, i get 55 for my <code>max</code> method. I am very confused.</p>  <p>I am keeping simple as of now, all I want to do is to get the first integer/char input and assign it to <code>max</code> . And once I read the 2nd integer, compare it to <code>max</code> to see if its greater or lower. Thanks!</p>
