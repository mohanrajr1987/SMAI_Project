<p>I've been trying to create a while loop that allows for infinite input of a name and a score pair until the user types 'end' for the name. However, whenever the program comes to the input.nextLine() part of my code, it gets skipped over and immediately moves on.</p>  <p>Here is a sample of the code:</p>  <pre><code>import java.util.Scanner; public class Problem5_8 { public static void main(String args[]) {     //CopyRight() func     CopyRight();      //Prompt user to give a series of scores     Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);     String name = "";     String name1 = "";     double score = 0;     String nameHigh = "";     double scoreHigh = 0;      //While loop for entering names and scores     while (name != "end") {         System.out.print("Enter the name of the student (type 'end' to end): ");         name = input.nextLine();         if (name != "end") {             System.out.print("What is his/her score?: ");             score = input.nextDouble();             if (score &gt; scoreHigh) {                 scoreHigh = score;                 nameHigh = name;             }         }      }     System.out.print("The highest score was " + scoreHigh + " by " + nameHigh + "."); }  //CopyRight() function public static void CopyRight() {     System.out.println("Welcome to my program!");     System.out.print("I certify that I have written and designed this program myself without ");     System.out.println("plagiarizing. This also means that it is Copyright protected.\n"); } } </code></pre>  <p>My output looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>Welcome to my program! I certify that I have written and designed this program myself without        plagiarizing. This also means that it is Copyright protected.  How many students are you recording?: 3 Enter student name: Enter score:  </code></pre>  <p>I don't really know why the input.nextLine() line is ignored.</p>
