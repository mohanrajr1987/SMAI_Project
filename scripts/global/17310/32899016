<p>I made a game focusing on "while loops." The game start with giving the user a option to choose how many sticks he/she wants to start with in the range of 20-100.</p>  <p>Then he/she will be prompted to take out 1-3 sticks (1,2 or 3), until there are no sticks left.</p>  <p>I have made the game successfully where one person plays by himself/herself until there are no sticks left:</p>  <pre><code>while True:     sticks= input("How many sticks (20-100)? ")      if int(sticks)&gt;100 or int(sticks)&lt;20:         print("Sorry, that's not valid. Try again.")      else:         print("thank you")          break  print()  print("There are", sticks," sticks on the table.")  while True:      takeout=input("How many sticks do you want to take (1, 2 or 3)? ")     print()      if int(takeout)&gt;3 or int(takeout)&lt;1:         print("Sorry, that's not valid.")          print ()              else:          left=int(sticks)-int(takeout)         if int(left)&lt;=0:             print("There are no sticks left on the table! Game over.")             break           print ("There are",left, "sticks on the table.")           sticks=int(sticks)-int(takeout)" </code></pre>  <p>The problem is I need to make this a 2 person game, where the program prompts a user 1 and a user two with the same finish of ending up with 0 sticks. If one of the user's enters an invalid response i.e inputting that he/she wants to take over 3 sticks, or negative sticks, then program must re-prompt the same user. </p>  <p>How do I do this?</p>
