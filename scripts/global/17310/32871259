<p>this is my first question in StackOverflow, so I hope that you will forgive me for the many possible error I'm going to make in setting this post.... My problem is the following : this code should generate a random number, display it to the user(in order to help me guess it whitout making too many attempts... this should be only an exercize), ask the user to guess a number between 0 and 50, check if the input is an integer or not and, If the user guesses the right number, print "Yes, the number is.." .  BUT, if the user digits a letter or whatever which is not a number, the if/else loop goes crazy and the program starts printing "Choose a number between 0 and 50: Please insert a number between 0 and 50, not a letter" whitout stopping...  Can anywone help me please?</p>  <pre><code>package methods;  import java.util.Scanner;  public class Methods {      static int randomNumber;     static Scanner userInput = new Scanner(System.in);      public static void main(String[] args) {          System.out.println(getRandomNum());          int guessResult = 1;         int randomGuess = 0;          while (guessResult != -1) {             System.out.print("Choose a number between 0 and 50: ");              if (userInput.hasNextInt()) {                 randomGuess = userInput.nextInt();                 guessResult = checkGuess(randomGuess);             } else {                  System.out.println("Please insert  a number, not  a letter");             }          }          System.out.println("Yes, the number is " + randomGuess);     }      public static int getRandomNum() {          randomNumber = (int) (Math.random() * 51);         return randomNumber;      }      public static int checkGuess(int guess) {          if (guess == randomNumber) {              return -1;         } else {              return guess;          }     } } </code></pre>
