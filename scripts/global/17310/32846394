<p>I have defined a procedure that calculates a lot of statistics, suppose that it's name is calc_stat. It's input is the name of the variable that I need to analyze. Now, in my table I have 200 distinct variables, and I want to apply the procedure calc_stat to all of them. It's obvious that it's crazy to repeat the calc_stat call 200 times, so I need a Loop. </p>  <p>The solution that I have found is to create a new procedure that, given the 200 names of my 200 variables, and the number of variables (200), can apply the procedure calc_stat 200 times. </p>  <p>I try to do something like this:</p>  <pre><code>ALTER PROCEDURE procedure        @variable1 nvarchar,         @variable2 nvarchar,         @max_index int BEGIN      DECLARE @i int      DECLARE @aux_variable varchar      SET @i=1       WHILE @i&lt;=@max_index        BEGIN            SET @aux_variable='@variable'+convert(varchar(10),@i)             -- this returns the string '@variablei'            -- do somethig to obtain the name of the variable????            -- apply procedure to calculate statistics to the @variablei            SET @Sent=''                 SELECT   @Sent =                'EXEC calc_stat 'value of @aux_variable'            EXEC(@Sent)        END END </code></pre>  <p>Having the strings "variable1" and "variable2" stored in the auxiliar variable @aux_variable in each iteration, I need to define a dynamic variable whose value is the input value of @variable1 and @variable2 in each iteration.</p>  <p>This code works if I do it without the while and using directly the variables @variable1 and @variable2, but with more variables, I can't do that.</p>  <p>It must be easy, but I can't find any information about it! </p>  <p>Thank you!</p>
