<p>I'm trying to read contents from a file "file.txt" and write each character from there to "copy.txt" but I get a weird character at the end of the "copy.txt" file.</p>  <p>I'm trying to open and close the two files and modify the body of the while loop in the program so that the character is no longer put to standard output (stdout).</p>  <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;  int main() {   char c;   FILE *from, *to;    from = fopen("file.txt", "r");   if (from == NULL)   {     perror("file.txt doesn't exist.");     exit(1);   }    to = fopen("copy.txt", "w");   if (to == NULL)     {       perror("copy.txt doesn't exist.");       exit(1);     }   do     {       c = getc(from);       putc(c, to);     }   while(c != EOF);   fclose(to);   fclose(from);   exit(0); } </code></pre>
