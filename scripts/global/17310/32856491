<p>So whenever I run this code, the code runs and prints out the results, then it runs again and prints some arbitirary results, and again, and again, then it lets me input for another loop. I could not find the error and tried searching online.</p>  <p>Help appreciated</p>  <pre><code>while (x &gt; 0) {     printf("Please enter your money and nickels (ex. $12.63 and 3 nickels). \nEnter 0 to end program:\n");     scanf("%c %lf %s %d", &amp;dollar, &amp;money, &amp;andWord, &amp;nickel_input);      if (dollar == '0')     {         printf("Thanks for using the program!");         return 0;     }      money *= 100;      money -= nickels * 5;      quarters = (money / 25);     money -= quarters * 25;      dimes = (money / 10);     money -= dimes * 10;      nickels = (money / 5);     money -= nickels * 5;      pennies = (money / 1);     money -= pennies * 1;      coins = quarters + dimes + nickels + pennies;      nickels += nickel_input;      printf("The fewest number of coins that you could have is %d:\n", coins);     printf("# quarters: %d\n", quarters);     printf("# dimes: %d\n", dimes);     printf("# nickels: %d\n", nickels);     printf("# pennies: %d\n\n", pennies); } </code></pre>  <p>By the way, this is just an excerpt from the code if you didn't know.</p>
