<p>I'm trying to write a program where the program will ask you your name, confirm that you want this name, then check to see if you said yes or no. I have the "no" loop working, where it will ask for a name again, but I'm trying to a loop where if you type anything other than yes or no it will say "Please type yes or no." then ask if you want to confirm your name, then check the answer again. Heres what I have.</p>  <pre><code>echo -e $WHITE"Name your$GREEN Hero$WHITE." read HERO clear echo -e "Are you sure you want your$GREEN Hero$WHITE's name to be$GREEN "$HERO"$WHITE? y/n" read ANSWER1 while [ $ANSWER1 = "no" ]; do # # # clear echo -e $WHITE"Name your$GREEN Hero$WHITE." read HERO clear echo -e "Are you sure you want your$GREEN Hero$WHITE's name to be$GREEN "$HERO"$WHITE? y/n" read ANSWER1 done    while [ $ANSWER1 != "yes" ] || [ $ANSWER1 != "no" ]; do # # #    clear    echo -e $WHITE"Please type yes or no."    sleep 1.5    clear    echo -e $WHITE"Are you sure you want your$GREEN Hero$WHITE's name to be$GREEN "$HERO"$WHITE?"    read ANSWER1    clear    done clear echo -e -n $WHITE"Loading" sleep 1.5 echo -e -n "." sleep 1.5 echo -e -n "." sleep 1.5 echo -e -n "." sleep 1.5 clear echo -e "Done." </code></pre>  <p>If I go through the "Please type yes or no." it will freeze at the sleep and not clear, therefore not displaying the echo and continuing the loop. Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!</p>
