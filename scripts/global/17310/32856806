<p>I am trying to create a while loop where the user has a total of three tries to enter a valid number. I'm not understanding how the system recognizes that 3 invalid attempts have been made before displaying the message. Classes, variables, and scanner objects are made. After the three attempts, I want to say "No more tries". I already have the program written to use the user's input for quantity if its valid. This is just if they input three invalid attempts. &nbsp;</p>  <pre><code>Updated code:  </code></pre>  <p>int quantity = 0;</p>  <pre><code>        // Get user's desired amount of lemonade cups         System.out.print("Hello " + name + ". How many cups of lemonade can I get you? ");         quantity = keyboard.nextInt(); // Store amount of cups wanted          int attempts = 0;         int maxAttempts = 3;         double subTotal = quantity * lemonadeCost;         double totalTax = subTotal * 0.08;         double totalPrice = subTotal + totalTax;          while (attempts &lt; maxAttempts) {             if (quantity &lt; 1 || quantity &gt;= 20) {                 System.out.println("That is an invalid amount, please try again");                 quantity = keyboard.nextInt(); }               else {                  System.out.println("Subtotal: " + defaultFormat.format(subTotal));                  System.out.println("Tax: " + defaultFormat.format(totalTax));                  System.out.println("Total: " + defaultFormat.format(totalPrice));                   continue;             }              attempts++;                 if (attempts &gt;= 3) {                     System.out.print ("No lemonade for you");                     break;                 }             // Ask for user's payment method             Scanner method = new Scanner(System.in);             System.out.println("How would you like to pay, " + name + "?
