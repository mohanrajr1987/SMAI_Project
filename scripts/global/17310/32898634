<p>my code seems to work up to the line before WHILE loop. The idea is to have the computer try to guess the number inputted by Player 1('P1') by picking a middle number from the lowest and highest number of previous guesses. I cant figure out why does it keep looping!</p>  <pre><code>import random  P1 = raw_input("The number should be between 0 to 100: \n")  P1 = int(P1) previousguess = [] count2 = 0  for c in range(2):     cg2 = random.randint(0,100)     print "Computer has guessed: %d" %cg2     if P1 != cg2:         previousguess.append(cg2) #adding the guess into "Previous Guess" list         print previousguess  mn = min(previousguess) mx = max(previousguess)  while True:     if P1 != cg2:         cg2 = (mn+mx)/2 #guess based on middle of highest and lowest         print "Computer has guessed: %d" %cg2         previousguess.append(cg2)         count2+=1  else:     print "The Computer has guessed it in %d times" %count2 </code></pre>
