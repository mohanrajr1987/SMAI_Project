<p>I've been at this for a few hours now. I am making a small game in C++ and I am trying to figure out how I can edit variables from inside of a function. I can place the variables in the main() and edit them them there no problem, but I can't figure out what I need to do to edit from a function. Below is the function.</p>  <pre><code>void HeroSelect(string&amp; hero) {     int gold = 20, health = 5, attack = 5, stats[2] = { health, attack };     string weapon;     cout &lt;&lt; "Please choose your hero.\n";     cin &gt;&gt; hero;     if (hero == "Warrior" || hero == "warrior")     {         weapon = "Broad Sword";         cout &lt;&lt; "You are a Warrior wielding a " &lt;&lt; weapon &lt;&lt; endl;         cout &lt;&lt; "Good choice.\n"             &lt;&lt; "You start out with " &lt;&lt; gold &lt;&lt; " gold." &lt;&lt; endl             &lt;&lt; "You have " &lt;&lt; stats[0]&lt;&lt; " health and " &lt;&lt; stats[1] &lt;&lt; " attack.\n";     } </code></pre>  <p>Above is the function definition and I want to be able to edit the health when the player gets attacked or say gets a stronger weapon. Below is the main() of the script.</p>  <pre><code>void main() {     double enter, room1, room2, room3, room4, BossRoom;     int,   gold = 20; //This is used as part of check inventory and will be subtracted when necessary     string hero, weapon;       //Set decimal two places     cout.setf(ios::fixed);     cout.setf(ios::showpoint);     cout.precision(2);      Intro(enter);      cout &lt;&lt; "The first step in this adventure is to choose your hero. You can choose a warrior, a wizard, or an archer.\n";      HeroSelect(hero); </code></pre>  <p>So let's say he gets a new weapon and it gives +1 attack how do I reflect that in the function? Would I create a separate function for this? </p>  <p>As the player goes through the game, they can type in "stats" whenever, and when they do I want it to display their current health and attack and then essentially just loop back to the beginning of the room or fight they are in.</p>  <p>I know I can make the changes to the variables if I made all of my loops and all of my if-else statements in main(), but I wanted to try this and keep my main script clean. I did stats as an array, because I think it is good to print the array as a list. Any help would be great. Thanks!</p>
