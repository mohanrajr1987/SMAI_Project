<p>I'm looking to upload multiple files to a folder once all of the conditions are met successfully. I'm allowing the user to choose how many files they'd like to upload, however am receiving this error from the script:</p>  <p><code>Notice: Undefined offset: 1 in C:\xampp\htdocs\FreeCheese\news_parse.php on line 54</code></p>  <p><strong>Note:</strong></p>  <p>The number following 'Undefined offset:', in this case is set to '1'. When I chose to insert more file fields into the page this number becomes whatever the number of current file fields are being read by the PHP.</p>  <p><strong>EG: I have three file fields, the error would then become:</strong></p>  <p><code>Notice: Undefined offset: 3 in C:\xampp\htdocs\FreeCheese\news_parse.php on line 54</code></p>  <p>If I <strong>do</strong> select three files to upload, all of them are being correctly inserted into the folder, so I have no idea why I am being given an error when it is functioning as it should.</p>  <p>If anyone could help me fix this error then it'd be much appreciated.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance, Rich</p>  <p><strong>Here is my code:</strong></p>  <pre><code>// Set the array object to 0 when entering the loop. $i = 0; while ($_FILES['upload1']['tmp_name'][$i]) { $imgName1 = preg_replace("#[^a-z0-9.]#i", "", $_FILES['upload1']['name'][$i]);  // Applies a unique number before the file name to prevent files from overwriting. $imgName1 = mt_rand(100000, 999999).$imgName1;  // Moves the image into the images/ folder move_uploaded_file($imgTmp1[$i], "images/$imgName1");  // Sets the next array object in the loop to 1 etc etc    $i ++; } </code></pre>
