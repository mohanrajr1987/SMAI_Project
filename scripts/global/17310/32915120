<p>I am having trouble figuring out why my code is not printing out anything after I input a value for word. I can input a word, but it does not output anything after evaluating through the while loop. What are your thoughts?</p>  <pre><code>ai = "eye-" ae = "eye-" ao = "ow-" au = "ow-" ei = "ay-" eu = "eh-oo-" iu = "ew-" oi = "oy-" ou = "ow-" ui = "ooey-" a = "ah-" e = "eh-" i = "ee-" o = "oh-" u = "oo-" p = "p" k = "k" h = "h" l = "l" m = "m"  n = "n"  word = input("Please enter a Hawaiian word you want pronounced") character_count1 = int(0) character_count2 = int(1) pronunciation = ""  while character_count1 &lt; len(word):     if word[character_count1:character_count2] == ai or word[character_count1:character_count2] == "ae"or word[character_count1:character_count2] == "ao"or word[character_count1:character_count2] == "ei"or word[character_count1:character_count2] == "eu"or word[character_count1:character_count2] == "iu"or word[character_count1:character_count2] == "oi"or word[character_count1:character_count2] == "ou":         print("your word",pronunciation + word[character_count1:character_count2])         character_count1 + 2 and character_count2 + 2     elif word[character_count1:character_count1] == a or word[character_count1:character_count1] == e or word[character_count1:character_count1] == i or word[character_count1:character_count1] == o or word[character_count1:character_count1] == p or word[character_count1:character_count1] == k or word[character_count1:character_count1] == h or word[character_count1:character_count1] == l or word[character_count1:character_count1] == m or word[character_count1:character_count1] == n:         print("your word",pronunciation + word[character_count1:character_count1] )         character_count1 + 1 and character_count2 + 1 </code></pre>
