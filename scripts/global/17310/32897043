<p>Whilst coding a binary conversion program for my friend I kept getting an index out of range error when using the <code>X[N] = Y</code> command whereby <code>X</code> was a list, <code>N</code> was the index number is the list (represented by a variable called <code>Bit</code>) and <code>Y</code> was the value I was assigning to variable in index <code>N</code> in list <code>X</code>.</p>  <p>Well I should've just put the code and explained but basically it is saying the index is out of bounds whilst the code <code>Numbers[Bit] = 0</code> or <code>Number[Bit] = 1</code> is within a while loop, however it works everywhere else in the code. The variable <code>Bit</code> is equal to integer 7 and the list <code>Numbers</code> contains variables <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code>, <code>d</code>, <code>e</code>, <code>f</code>, <code>g</code> and <code>h</code> all separated meaning there are 0-7 indexes. And I tried with a <code>Bit</code> value of 0 and this did not work either. However the code worked fine as long as the <code>Numbers[Bit]</code> code sections were placed outside of the while loop. Any ideas?</p>  <pre><code>a = 0 b = 0 c = 0 d = 0 e = 0 f = 0 g = 0 h = 0  def loop():     Bit = 7     Numbers = [a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h];     Num = 128     Input = int(input("What Number do you want to convert?" ))      while Input &gt; 0:         if Input &gt; Num:             Input = Input - Num             Numbers[Bit] = 1         else:             Numbers[Bit] = 0          Bit = Bit - 1         Num = Num/2     Numbers = str(Numbers)     print (Numbers)  loop() </code></pre>
