<p>Please look at following while loop code written in Python:</p>  <pre><code>x=25 epsilon=0.01  high=max(1.0,x) low=0.0 *ans=(low+high)/2.0*  while abs(ans**2-x)&gt;=epsilon:     if ans2&gt;x:         high=ans     else:         low=ans    *ans = (high + low)/2.0* print("ans:",ans,) </code></pre>  <p>This is a guess loop (exhaustion), it should find the approx for square root of a positive number within the margin error on 0,01.  But I cant understand why we must define ans (ans=(low+high)/2.0) the second time, first before the loop and then again in the loop.  Could someone tell me what purpose the second definition have since im seeing the first one being enough?</p>  <p>Thanks Arif</p>
