<p>I have this code below and it does not worked. However if I declare <code>Integer</code> variable before while loop it can worked. The output will be printed. </p>  <pre><code>        query = "SELECT COUNT(*) AS tot_by_code FROM `hr` WHERE `hr`.`code` = ?";                       st = conn.prepareStatement(query);         st.setString(1, code);         rs = st.executeQuery();          //Integer tot_by_code = null;         while (rs.next()) {             Integer tot_by_code = rs.getInt("tot_by_code");         }           System.out.println("Total patient by code : " + tot_by_code); </code></pre>  <p>I check other thread and supposedly you can declare variable before loop or inside loop so why I can't ran my code with variable declaration inside while loop? Thanks in advance.</p>
