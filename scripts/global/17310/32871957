<p>I am fairly new to R, and am trying to write a steepest ascent optimization function as follows:</p>  <pre><code>SteepestAscent &lt;- function(gradf, x_0, epsilon, niter, f){   for (i in 1:niter){     m &lt;- c(x[i])     d &lt;- gradf(x[i]) / norm_x(gradf(x[i]))     s &lt;- 1     while (f(x[i] +s*d) &lt; f(x[i])){       s &lt;- s/2     }     x[i+1] &lt;- x[i] +s*d     m &lt;- rbind(m, x[i+1])     return(norm_x(gradf))      }  } </code></pre>  <p>When I attempt to run it with inputs though  I receive the following error for my while statement: </p>  <pre><code>Error in while (f(x[i] + s * d) &lt; f(x[i])) { :    missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed </code></pre>  <p>I have some function <code>f</code> and its gradiant <code>gradf</code> elsewhere, and in my while statement I am trying to say that <em>while f(x(i) + s * d) is less than f(x(i)), make s = s/2 and rerun until I am guaranteed on exit that the left side is >= the right side</em>. The inputs are some function <code>f</code>, its gradiant, some starting point <code>x0</code>, a small epsilon, and a number of iterations that I choose. Any help would be greatly appreciated. </p>
