<p>I'm writing a python code for my intro into computer science class and I'm looking for feedback and some help on how to not over complicate it. I'm new to coding so this is my first code I have done. I'm using the latest python version. This is the assignment that I have been given:</p>  <p>This is called the vault breaker game.</p>  <p>In this variation of Vault Breaker, here are the rules:</p>  <ol> <li>No digit is used twice in the code.</li> <li>The first player gives feedback as follows  <ul> <li>For every correct digit in the correct place, the computer prints a =.</li> <li>For every digit less than the digit in its place, the computer prints a &lt;.</li> <li>For every digit greater than the digit in its place, the computer prints a >.</li> </ul></li> </ol>  <p>So, for example, if the code was 1234, and the guess was 1324, the feedback would be ==&lt;>. Note that the feedback is not in the order of the digits, but in the order of the A/B/C rule above. (This makes the game harder—after all we want our vault to be secure!) </p>  <p>For this program, you can hard code the “vault” to have a code of 1234. Your program should do the following:</p>  <ul> <li>Prompt the player for a guess. </li> <li>Check to see if the player guessed the code right.  </li> <li>If they got it right, tell them they won and continue the game.  </li> <li>If they didn’t get it right, give the player feedback for that guess, and let them guess again, continuing the guess/feedback process until they get it right.</li> </ul>  <p>Here is an example of the given output. But get creative!:</p>  <pre><code>Guess the code (four digits): 1324 Nope! Your clue is: ==&lt;&gt; Guess the code (four digits): 1243 Nope! Your clue is: ==&lt;&gt; Guess the code (four digits): 1111 Nope! Your clue is: =&lt;&lt;&lt; Guess the code (four digits): 2222 Nope! Your clue is: =&lt;&lt;&gt; Guess the code (four digits): 7834 Nope! Your clue is: ==&gt;&gt; Guess the code (four digits): 1234 You broke the vault! </code></pre>  <p>I have created my own, so far its just a skeleton of the final code and I'm already having a few problems with it. I would really appreciate any help you all could provide. Here is my code so far:</p>  <pre><code>code=['1','2','3','4']  guess=input('Guess the code (four digits):') report=[] if len(guess) !=4: guess=input('Guess the code (four digits):') if guess='1234':     print('You broke the Vault! Congradulations',name)     if guess in range[0:3]==1:         report.append('=')     if guess in range[0:3] &lt; 1:         report.append('&gt;')         print('Nope! Your clue is:',report.append)     if guess in range[0:3] &gt; 1:         report.append('&lt;')         print('Nope! Your clue is:',report.append)         else:             print('Nope! Your clue is:',report.append)     if guess in range[0:3]==2:         report.append('=')     if guess in range[0:3] &lt; 2:         report.append('&gt;')         print('Nope! Your clue is:',report.append)     if guess in range[0:3] &gt; 2:         report.append('&lt;')         print('Nope! Your clue is:',report.append)         else:             print('Nope! Your clue is:',report.append)     if guess in range[0:3]==2:         report.append('=')     if guess in range[0:3] &lt; 3:         report.append('&gt;')         print('Nope! Your clue is:',report.append)     if guess in [0:3] &gt; 3:         report.append('&lt;')         print('Nope! Your clue is:',report.append)         else:             print('Nope! Your clue is:',report.append)     if guess in range[0:3]==4:         report.append('=')     if guess in range[0:3] &lt; 4:         report.append('&gt;')         print('Nope! Your clue is:',report.append)     if guess in range[0:3] &gt; 4:         report.append('&lt;')         print('Nope! Your clue is:',report.append)         else:         print('Nope! Your clue is:',report.append) selection=input('Would you like to play again? y/n: ') if selection=='y':     print('Thanks for playing!') elif selection =='n':     print('Let\'s play again!')  elif selection != 'y' or selection != 'n':     selection=input('Please enter y or n: ') </code></pre>  <p>After running the program this is my output:</p>  <pre><code>Guess the code (four digits):4321 Would you like to play again? y/n: y </code></pre>  <p>What I'm trying to do is have it so that when you get the wrong answer it gives you hints, example:    </p>  <pre><code>Guess the code (four digits): 1324 Nope! Your clue is: ==&lt;&gt; </code></pre>  <p>But so far its not reading that part of code. I'm having a hard time getting the =&lt;> signs to work, I'm not sure how to type it in so I made an attempt at it.</p>
