<p>As posted <a href="http://serverfault.com/questions/343197/grep-progress-bar-using-pv-pipe-viewer">here</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/238073/how-to-add-a-progress-bar-to-a-shell-script">here</a>, pipeviewer is a tool that shows content progress based on it's size. As seen there, the proposal of their questions is to get a progress bar of a process running without data volume.</p>  <p>I was wondering if is it possible to show progress of a loop with pipeviewer, considering that I'm reading it from a file, and I know it's size.</p>  <p>I've trying something like </p>  <p><code>while IFS= read -r line;  do    &lt;code&gt;  done &lt; file.txt | pv</code></p>  <p>And this definitelly doesn't work, since pv shows only an empty progress bar.</p>  <p>Any ideas? </p>  <p>Thank you in advance!</p>
