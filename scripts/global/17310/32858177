<p>For some reason I'm having difficulty getting this while loop to work. It keeps crashing my browser whenever I try to test it out, and in the one case that I was able to see the results of the loop in the console, all I saw was NaN printed several times. Is there something I've forgotten in my code?</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div id="output"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;script&gt;  var starting = prompt("What is your starting balance?"); var target = prompt("What is your target balance?"); var interest = prompt("What is your interest rate?"); var periods = 0;  var current = starting; var greaterThan = false;  while (greaterThan === false) {   if (current &lt; target) {     current = current + (current * interest);     periods++;   } else {     greaterThan = true;     alert("it took " + periods + " periods to make your starting balance greater than your target balance.");     document.querySelector('#output').textContent = "to grow an initial investment of " + starting + " to " + target + " at a " + interest + " interest rate will require " + periods + " investment periods.";   } }  &lt;/script&gt;  </code></pre>
