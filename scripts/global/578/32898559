<pre><code>def recursiveSearch(rootDir):     file = 'foundMe'      # Creates a full path back to the root directory with each item in list     for p in os.listdir(rootDir):         path = os.path.join(rootDir, p)         if os.path.isfile(path):                 if os.path.splitext(os.path.basename(path))[0] == file:                     print("congrats you found", path)                      return path          else:             if os.path.isdir(path):                 recursiveSearch(path)  x = recursiveSearch(rootDir) print(x) -&gt;&gt;&gt; None </code></pre>  <p>Why does this function return the None type and not the path of the file that I have found?</p>  <p>When I run the function, the recursion works and is able to find and print the path to the file, but nothing is returned. Could someone please explain why?</p>
