<p>As an exercise, I'm trying to find the lowest positive number in a list using recursion in Python. This almost works, finding the 2 when it does <code>print(first)</code>, but then it ends up returning <code>None</code>. Is there a way to fix this code or am I on the wrong track?</p>  <pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>def find_lowest(lst):     """Return the lowest positive number in a list."""     def lowest(first, rest):         # Base case         if len(rest) == 0:             print(first) # This line is only to check the value             return first         if first &gt; rest[0] or first &lt; 0:             lowest(rest[0], rest[1:])         else:             lowest(first, rest[1:])     return lowest(lst[0], lst[1:])  a = [6, -4, 4, 8, -127, 5, 7, 2, 3, 9] print(find_lowest(a)) # Prints None, but should print the lowest number </code></pre>  <p><strong>Edit:</strong> this question is not exactly the same as the other one. People searching for this kind of answer will not find the other one, because it is asking a similar question but in a very different way. Stack Overflow has useful content, but the hostility and downvoting are obnoxious.</p>
