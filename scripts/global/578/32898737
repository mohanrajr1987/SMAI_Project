<p>So getArea calls getHeight which calls getArea and creates a never ending loop. I'm being graded on writing as little code as possible and reusing as many functions as possible. </p>  <p>Is there anyway I could get this working with the function calls rather then just substituting the forumula for getArea into getHeight where getArea is called?</p>  <pre><code>//returns the area of a trapezoid public double getArea(){     double height = getHeight();     double area = (.5 * ((getPoint(3).getX() - getPoint(4).getX()) + (getPoint(2).getX() - getPoint(1).getX()))) * height;     return area; }  //returns the height of a trapezoid public double getHeight(){     double area = getArea();     double height = (2 * area) / (((getPoint(3).getX() - getPoint(4).getX()) + (getPoint(2).getX() - getPoint(1).getX())));     return height; } </code></pre>
