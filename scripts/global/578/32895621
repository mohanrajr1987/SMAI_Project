<p>I have two simple functions:</p>  <p>a) </p>  <pre><code>drawRight(x){ // where x is integer       if(x == 0 )          draw();       else{          drawRight(x-1);          doSomething();          drawLeft(x-1);       }    } </code></pre>  <p>b) (very similar to a) )</p>  <pre><code>drawLeft(x){ // where x is integer       if(x == 0 )          draw();       else{          drawRight(x-1);          doSomething2();          drawLeft(x-1);       }    } </code></pre>  <p>My question is: is it even possible to draw flowchart if i call e.g drawRight(5) ? I did flowchart for only self calling recurvive function but cant find solution for this one.</p>  <p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
