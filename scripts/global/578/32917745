<p>It gives  multiple declaration of <strong>"mPH"</strong> </p>  <p>here is the code </p>  <pre><code>dotProduct x y = sum(zipWith (*) x y)  matrixProduct x y = mPH [] x y  mPH acc [] b = acc  countHelp countacc c [] = countacc  countHelp countacc c (d:ds) = countHelp ((dotProduct c d) : countacc) c ds  mPH acc (a:as) b = mPH ((countHelp [] a b) : acc) as b </code></pre>  <p>can anyone explain a little bit for me?  Suppose my input will be </p>  <pre><code>x = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]] y = [[7,9,11],[8,10,12]] matrixProduct x y </code></pre>  <p>It should give back  martix [[64,58],[154,139]]</p>  <p>what I think is each time I taking out first list of the first matrix when the the matrix become a empty list the recursion will stop.</p>
