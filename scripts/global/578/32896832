<p>I've been trying to write a <strong>recursive function</strong> that would reorder an array of objects based on the order provided by another array (simple, numeric array).</p>  <p>I want to use this sorting function to sort an array of objects by a 'template' array that would hold only one property of each object present in the array to sort, e.g.</p>  <p><code>$template = ['A', 'B', 'C']</code></p>  <p>Array to sort:</p>  <pre><code>$myArray = [     new Element('B'),     new Element('C'),     new Element('A'), ]  class Element {     public $name;      public function __construct($name)     {         $this-&gt;name = $name;     } } </code></pre>  <p>I was not successful. Perhaps you might have an idea about how to apprach this task?</p>
