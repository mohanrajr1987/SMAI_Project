<p>So I'm just starting to learn about recursion and I'm confused as to how avoid this problem.  I will write a function that needs to store a variable, like a sum, but I have to declare the variable in the function so every time the recursive call is made the variable gets initialized again.  How can I fix this? I think a helper function of some short but I'm not really sure. </p>
