<p>I am trying to make a program that, with a given word, can calculate and print every letter combination. To be more specific, I am asked to use a recursive function and what I should get is something like this:</p>  <p>Given word: HOME</p>  <p>EHOM</p>  <p>EMOH</p>  <p>MEHO</p>  <p>The approach I am taking in to swap the content #x with #x+1 like this</p>  <p>string[0]->string[1]</p>  <p>string[0]->string[2]</p>  <p>This is what I came up with</p>  <pre><code>void anagram(char * s, int len, int y) { char temp; //used to store the content to swap betwen the two   if (len &lt; 0) //when the total lenght of the array gets to 0 it means that every single swap has been made     return;  temp = s[len]; //swapping s[len] = s[y]; s[y] = temp;  puts(s); //prints the string  if (y == 0)                          return anagram(s, len-1, y - 1);  return anagram(s, len, y - 1);  } </code></pre>  <p>What I get is just a huge mess and a Break Point from VS (if not a crash).</p>  <p>Can somebody help me please?</p>
