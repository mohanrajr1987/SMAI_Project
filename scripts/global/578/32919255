<p>I am a first year undergraduate CSc student who is looking to get into competitive programming. </p>  <p>Recursion involves defining and solving sub problems. As I understand, top down dynamic programming (dp) involves memoizing the solutions to sub problems to reduce the time complexity of the algorithm.  </p>  <p>Can top down dp be used to improve the efficiency of <em>every</em> recursive algorithm with overlapping sub problems? Where would dp fail to work and how can I identify this? </p>
