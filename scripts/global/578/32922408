<p>I did it with a for loop.</p>  <pre><code>def base2dec(nums, base):     adding = []     power = -1     for num in nums[::-1]:         power+=1         adding.append(num*pow(base, power))     return sum(adding) </code></pre>  <p>But the tutorial exercise requires that I do it using recursion. Which I don't quite understand. The function <code>base2dec(nums,base)</code> takes a list of integers (<code>nums</code>) in the given <code>base</code>and returns the corresponding base 10 number. Can you guys show me how to do it with recursion? I really don't know how.</p>
