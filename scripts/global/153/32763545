<p>I'm currently migrating some code from VB6.0 to VB.NET and have noticed an issue. I'm fairly new to VB6.0 and I'm now aware that multiple values can be returned by the following:</p>  <pre><code>Function test(str1 As String, str2 As String) As Long  str1 = "Hello World1" str2 = "Hello World2"  test = 0  End Function </code></pre>  <p>When I debug I can see that the parameter passed is now updated. However my issue is that VB.NET doesn't seem to do this. How can I do this in VB.NET?</p>  <p>Any advice would be appreciated.</p>
