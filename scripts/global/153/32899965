<p>I'm having a problem about accesibility of a class and that class is under a reference of "Microsoft.VisualBasic.Compatibility". I'm using 3.5 .NET FRAMEWORK by the way. Below is the error in my project. Can you help me guys?</p>  <p>Actually, I have two solutions in VB.NET. The one I being copied is running smoothly (no error in here) but in my project there's an error. Please check screenshots below.</p>  <p>Thanks Guys.</p>  <p>PS: BELOW IS MY CODE. (Not the entire module just only the procedure)</p>  <pre><code>Public Sub m_splitBar_MouseDown(ByVal eventSender As System.Object, ByVal eventArgs As System.Windows.Forms.MouseEventArgs) Handles m_splitBar.MouseDown     Dim Button As Short = eventArgs.Button \ &amp;H100000     Dim Shift As Short = System.Windows.Forms.Control.ModifierKeys \ &amp;H10000     Dim X As Single = VB6.PixelsToTwipsX(eventArgs.X)     Dim Y As Single = VB6.PixelsToTwipsY(eventArgs.Y)     'UPGRADE_WARNING: Couldn't resolve default property of object m_bMoving.
