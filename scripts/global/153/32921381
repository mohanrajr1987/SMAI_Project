<p>I am working on examination result system in vb.net which requires to calculate student ranks based on marks obtained. Subject marks data is stored in database. I am loading the subject marks in a datatable  </p>  <pre><code>da.Fill(dt) 'added to a datagridview.   DataGridView1.DataSource = dt  </code></pre>  <p>then Add New columns in dt to show result:</p>  <pre><code>            dt.Columns.Add("Obtained Marks", GetType(String))             dt.Columns.Add("Percent", GetType(String))             dt.Columns.Add("Result", GetType(String))             dt.Columns.Add("Rank", GetType(Integer)) </code></pre>  <p>Then calculated total of all the subjects &amp; added in obtained marks columns by looping through rows &amp; columns of datatable.</p>  <pre><code>        For s As Integer = 0 To dt.Rows.Count - 1             For t As Integer = 0 To dt.Columns.Count - 1               obtmarks += CDbl(dt.Rows(s).Item(t))             Next          dt.Rows(s)("Obtained Marks") = obtmarks          dt.Rows(s)("Result") = "PASS"          dt.Rows(s)("Rank") = 'RANK OF STUDENT        Next </code></pre>  <p>How can i calculate rank/position of students on the basis of total marks contained in datatable column "Obtained Marks".  i.e.      Student with marks 436 Rank should be 1      Student with marks 429.5 Rank should be 2     Student with marks 412 Rank should be 3 .... </p>  <p>so on until all the rows in record. (Image atttached)</p>  <p>if there is any function for datatable which can help here or how can i add the logic in the loop to calculate rank of students and add the value in rank column. Thanks </p>  <p>P.S. I dnt want to sort the rows on obtained marks, but want to Add rank of each student in front of his/her marks, which is already order by their Roll No. <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5yLC9.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5yLC9.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
