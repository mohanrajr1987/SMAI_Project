<p>I developed an application 13 years ago using Visual Basic 6.0 on a computer running Windows 2000 Pro. I need to maintain the VB6 application and it also uses a 32-bit plug-in called ActiveReports.</p>  <p>Today, my computer is running Windows 7 Pro 64-bit.</p>  <p>Is it better to install and run Visual Studio/Basic 6.0 in a Virtual Machine running Windows 2000/XP on my Windows 7 host computer, or natively in Windows 7 (with installation help using <a href="http://nuke.vbcorner.net/Articles/VB60/VisualStudio6Installer/tabid/93/language/it-IT/Default.aspx" rel="nofollow">Visual Studio 6.0 Installer</a>)?</p>
