<p>I have a slight problem with getting records in my report made in vb6. my stored procedure looks like this </p>  <pre><code>create proc sp_rpt  (@area varchar(20),  @type varchar(20) )   as   select * from tableA where (area=@area) and type in (@type) </code></pre>  <p>That is what i tried, but i do not get my records. although if i replace @type with 'Commercial','Domestic' in SQL server itself i get perfect results.  The string being passed from vb6 is in this form 'Commercial','Domestic' i have a variable in vb6 named categories .</p>  <pre><code>categories="'commercial','Domestic'" </code></pre>  <p>if you have an idea on how i should go about this please help. </p>
