<p>I have a function in vb6 that receives a generic form and then performs various manipulations on that page.  I'm trying to convert from vb6 to vb.net and wpf. However i'm at a lost as what to do in this situation as page/Window manipulation is very different from vb6.</p>  <p>I would like to not use the find child function as I think it's very inefficient to do it for each control. </p>  <p>Can anyone help?</p>  <p>The function (partial):</p>  <pre><code>Public Function SegurancaControlo(ByRef Frm As Form, ByVal Objecto, Optional ByVal Condicao As String) As Boolean On Error GoTo ErroEm_SegurancaControlo Dim rss As ADODB.Recordset Dim SQL As String   ' configura controlo SQL = (..)  If query(SQL, rss, "SYS") Then     Do Until rss.EOF     Select Case rss!Property         Case "E"             Frm.Controls(rss!NomeObjecto).Enabled = rss!Value         Case "L"             If (TypeOf Frm.Controls(rss!ObjectName) Is DataGrid) Then                 Frm.Controls(rss!ObjectName).AllowUpdate = False                 Frm.Controls(rss!ObjectName).AllowAddNew = False                 Frm.Controls(rss!ObjectName).AllowDelete = False             Else                 Frm.Controls(rss!NomeObjecto).Locked = rss!Value             End If          Case "V"             Frm.Controls(rss!ObjectName).Visible = rss!Value         Case "C"             Frm.Controls(rss!ObjectName).Caption = rss!Value      End Select     rss.MoveNext Loop End If (..) </code></pre>
