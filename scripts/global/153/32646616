<p>I must build an equation which performs on a database in IDEA SmartAnalyzer, so all the functions used must have a <strong>@</strong> in their name.</p>  <p>For example, this is the equation I must build: </p>  <pre><code>                        For Each vValue In vList                         i = i + 1                         If i = 1 Then                              sCriticalText = "\b" &amp; CStr(vValue) &amp; "\b"                         Else                              sCriticalText = sCriticalText &amp; "|\b" &amp; CStr(vValue) &amp; "\b"                         End If                     Next </code></pre>  <p>What I must do is to replace the <code>CStr()</code> function with one compatible with IDEA.  Does anybody know how to do this?</p>
