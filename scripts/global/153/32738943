<p>i have a problem to make a program that can read Barcode. What i want to do is a program (maybe a service? i don't know) that can capture barcode from a barcode scanner while is running in background.</p>  <p>I have found that i can check if is plugged in a specific barcode scanner with his VID/PID, here some code:</p>  <pre><code>Set wmi = GetObject("winmgmts://./root/cimv2")  Dim VID As String Dim PID As String     'Barcode scanner    VID = "VID_040B"    PID = "PID_6510"    'REV = "REV_0120"     For Each d In wmi.ExecQuery("SELECT * FROM Win32_USBControllerDevice")      If InStr(d.Dependent, VID &amp; "&amp;" &amp; PID) &gt; 0 Then        Debug.Print ("Barcode Scanner found it!")        Debug.Print wmi.Get(d.Dependent).Description      End If    Next </code></pre>  <p>How can I do that is read by my program only the input of my barcode scanner?</p>  <p>Thank you in advance.</p>
