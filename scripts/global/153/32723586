<p>I'm trying to create a stored procedure in SQL Server Management Studio where I can find any invoices in a table belonging to a certain Vendor with a certain status. For example I have Vendor 123456 from my VB application and I want to find if they have any invoices in my InvoiceTable where the status = B and return either a true or false value. This is what I have been trying so far: </p>  <pre><code>ALTER PROCEDURE [dbo].[CheckStatus]   @VendorNumber  char     AS BEGIN  Select distinct CASE WHEN OrderStatus = 'B' and VendorNumber = @VendorNumber then 'true' else 'False' END as Status from InvoiceTable  END  </code></pre>  <p>Right now it always returns a singular "False" value, no matter if orderstatus = B and vendornumber = @vendornumber or not.</p>  <p>I'm not sure if this is possible or I'm even on the right page</p>
