<p>I have a list of web addresses that I've already generated. The issue is, I believe the site uses php to generate their pages because when one of these addresses is navigated, the site adds a sub-directory to the address.</p>  <p>For example, if I navigate to...</p>  <pre><code>http://www.wowhead.com/item=43 </code></pre>  <p>the address becomes...</p>  <pre><code>http://www.wowhead.com/item=43/squires-boots </code></pre>  <p>The sub-directory is different for every item number.</p>  <p>What I want to do is gather the url I'm redirected to for each address I've generated, and as there's a LOT of addresses (some 127,000), I'm looking for the fastest way possible.</p>  <p>Currently, I'm using the webbrowser control (wb)</p>  <pre><code>Dim l As Long Dim ff As Long Dim strPerkText as String Dim sPaths() As String Dim lngTimer As Long Const lngWait As Long = 5  strPerkText = OpenFile    'using a sub to get this data  sPaths = Split(strPerkText, vbCrLf)  ff = FreeFile  Open App.Path &amp; "\ItemListURLs.txt" For Output As #ff     For l = 0 To UBound(sPaths)         lngTimer = Timer         wb.Navigate2 sPaths(l)         Do While wb.READYSTATE &lt;&gt; READYSTATE_COMPLETE             If Timer - lngTimer &gt;= lngWait Then                 Exit Do             End If             DoEvents         Loop         Write #ff, wb.LocationURL         DoEvents     Next l Close #ff </code></pre>  <p>lngWait is the amount of time I have to wait for wb to update with the new url, about 5 seconds per page, barring any errors. That means it would take roughly one week to do all the work with the way I have the program built now. I'm not sure if this can be accomplished any faster with either a different control, with API, or pure native code.</p>  <p>All suggestions are welcome.</p>
