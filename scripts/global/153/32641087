<p>This may be an easy question for some but I'm having a hard time finding the answer to it. I've looked everywhere online but all the threads I've checked out don't have an actual answer that works.</p>  <p>Question: What is the php equivalent for the vb val() function?</p>  <p>It would also be great if you could point me to a page that may have a list of vb to php functions.</p>  <p>I hope this question doesn't piss any one off!</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
