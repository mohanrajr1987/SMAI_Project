<p>I'm trying to call an SQL Stored procedure in VB6 that has a single input parameter. Basically the VB6 application hands over a vendor number and it checks the status of invoices for that vendor number, and if the status = A then it returns a false value, anything else returns a true value. I have my Stored Procedure working in SQL, but I cannot get it to work when I call it in my application. </p>  <p>Here is what I have so far.</p>  <p>This is for my button click: </p>  <pre><code>Dim cmd As ADODB.Command  Public dc As New DataConnection   Private sub btnCheckStatus_Click() Set cmd = New ADODB.Command      cmd.ActiveConnection = dc     cmd.CommandType = adCmdStoredProc      cmd.CommandText = "[dbo].[CheckStatus]"      cmd.Parameters.Append cmd.CreateParameter("@VendorNumber", adInteger, adParamInput, "6", VendorNumber)      cmd.execute  BalanceStatus = cmd(result)  Set cmd.ActiveConnection = Nothing  </code></pre>  <p>I can't seem to get the results out of the stored procedure, I tried to set it to a variable but it will not work, it gives me a type mismatch error</p>
