<p>I got an old vb6 project which I am trying to get going.</p>  <p>I have installed visual studio 6, installed vb6 service pack 6 and the update for service pack 6.</p>  <p>However when I open the project I keep getting the error:</p>  <pre><code>fpSpr60.ocx could not be loaded </code></pre>  <p>I figured out with google this has todo with fpspread but I also find this should be included inside vb6.  Does anyone have an idea where to look for?</p>
