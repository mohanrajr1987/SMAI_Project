<p>I'm having problems using Xpath in selectsinglenode and have found that I should be using xmlnamespacemanager. All well and good, but I can't find out where it is in VB6. Ideally I'd like to use late binding (as I'm not actually using VB6, but rather Lotusscript in Lotus Notes). Please could someone tell me how to get to it? Or, even how to use selectsinglenode in vb6 and have it work with namespaces: node = selectsinglenode("//xx:myname"), when I have a default namespace set in my XML. I don't want to remove the namespace declaration as it should go out with the finished XML.</p>  <p>I've declared the parser with no problem:</p>  <pre><code>Set doc = createobject("Microsoft.XMLDOM") </code></pre>  <p>but I can't locate the xmlnamespace manager.</p>  <p>Many thanks.</p>
