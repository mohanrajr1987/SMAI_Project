<p>First of all, I am using VB6, not VB.Net.</p>  <p>Now, I am trying to add events on dynamically-created array of controls. But when I try to add the WithEvents keyword to my array of controls, I get a "Compile Error: Expected: As" error.</p>  <p>Here's my code:</p>  <pre><code>Option Explicit Dim WithEvents btnNumbers() as CommandButton  Private Sub Form_Load()      ReDim btnNumbers(1 to 10) as CommandButton     Dim i as Integer      For i = 1 To UBound(btnNumbers) Then          Set btnNumbers(i) = Controls.Add("VB.CommandButton", "btnNumber" &amp; i)         Set btnNumbers(i).Container = Form1          With btnNumbers(i)              'Properties of btnNumbers here...          End With      Next  End Sub </code></pre>  <p>I want the buttons to display a message box that says it's number. Like for example when I clicked btnNumber4, a message box that says "I am Number 4!" to appear. I know how to do this message box part. The problem is that I can't add events to these buttons in order to do this.</p>  <p>Seeing that WithEvents doesn't seem to work, is there another way to add events to these buttons?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
