<p>I have written the following code :</p>  <pre><code>    If s_Temp3 Then               sdbname = s_Temp3      ElseIf Not IsEmpty(s_Temp1)              sdbname = s_Temp1      Else               sdbname = s_Temp2      End If  End If   </code></pre>  <p>When I try to compile, it gives me a syntax error on the line with <code>ElseIf Not IsEmpty(s_Temp1)</code> and I don't know why.</p>  <p>Does anyone know what's the problem? Thanks</p>
