<p>I am hoping you may be able to help with a solution. </p>  <p>I have hundreds of scanned jpeg images of an A4 sheet. The A4 sheet has on it various multiple choice questions (e.g. Q1) "score this"? 1 / 2 / 3 or Q2) "..."? True / False) each option for a question has a checkbox that is coloured in with black ink pen. </p>  <p>I am hoping to read the data from these files and import the data to a csv file rather than manually importing all the data. So have Column 1 = Question number / Column 2 = score for that question.. for example. </p>  <p>This is my ideal output solution - but any help would be appreciated.</p>  <p>Is there a way I can do this with python?</p>  <p>Many thanks.</p>
