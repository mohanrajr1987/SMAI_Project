<p>I'm working on a  web application selling gardening stuff, and I was wondering if there is anyway I can use Google API in order to define whether a range of houses within one specific street have got back gardens. because on satellite view i can clearly see the gardens so I was wondering whether its possible to use image recognition on that satellite view in order to determine green spaces and pin the streets where houses have gardens.??</p>  <p>I'd really appreciate any kind of help or hint.</p>
