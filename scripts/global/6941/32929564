<p>I just realized today that MATLAB's default convolving method for <code>imfilter</code> isn't convolution at all but correlation.  </p>  <p>I'm wondering, though, how this changes the results by <code>deconvblind</code>?  It uses a maximum likelihood algorithm, but does it do so for an image convolved with correlation or for one that is convolved by convolution?</p>  <p>Please help me!  I can't find any information on this on the MathWorks site at all.</p>
