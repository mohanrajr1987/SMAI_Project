<p>I want to make program to turn black and white images into text format (using unicode boxes, █)</p>  <p>so okay you've an image that looks like</p>  <p>JIF.JPEG</p>  <p>but you wanna make it look like this --</p>  <p>█ █</p>  <p>████</p>  <p>--</p>  <p>but how?!</p>  <p>well I suggest we take the photo and scan it one pixel at a time like so</p>  <p>█ █</p>  <p>████</p>  <ol> <li>1B1W1B</li> <li>9W</li> <li>4B</li> </ol>  <p>and then we simply have it extracted again!</p>  <p>I'd like too thank those of you who answered my qeustion below and for putting out how non-specific I was being out their</p>  <p>I've decided that'll use simple batch too do this by substition operation's</p>  <p>also my program will first convert the file into a B&amp;W monochrome BMP image first too keep as much quality as possible then when it's done it'll open the file and change certain pixel's into either (UNICODE)Boxes and leave spaces for anything white that's left over(ALTHOUGH I DO REALLY APPRECIATE THE CODES YOUVE GIVEN ME! I also wanted too make it so that this program would run on semi-older operating system's via 32 win bat)</p>  <p>so this is the code i've so far</p>  <pre><code>'@ECHO OFF' 'XCOPY(FILE) to &gt;&gt; tmp.file' 'start paint 'tmp.file' | -save_BMP_MONOCHROME-'  'start tmp.file | ?substitution-script? &amp; save enter' 'PAUSE' </code></pre>  <p>That's as close as i've gotten, and, am currently working on the substition script(s). That way it would also work for most system's as well as images, thanks for any other help in advanced once again!</p>
