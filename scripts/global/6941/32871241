<p>I want to create a very simple website, where the user uploads a picture for which edgemap and histogram is to be displayed. I am very new to web technologies. I have the code to get the edgemap and histogram in c++. I intend to use the c++ code. Can you guys guide me to the setup and tech. I am not looking for something fancy.</p>  <p>So when the user clicks on the EdgeMap button, I want it to use my c++ code and generate the edge image and then display it on the website. Likewise for the histogram. </p>
