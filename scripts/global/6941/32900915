<p>I am trying to identify playing cards in images. After I have successfully detected edges using Canny ( <a href="http://imgur.com/a/l4Kjd" rel="nofollow">http://imgur.com/a/l4Kjd</a> ), I know that I must use the inverse perspective transform to map the playing card for a straight look so that I can use template matching to identify the card. Is corner detection a viable method to engineering the inverse perspective of a single, or multiple, card? And if so, what would be a good corner detection -> inverse perspective transform technique combination to employ?</p>  <p>For the record I'm trying to implement this in my own code, as apposed to relying heavily on OpenCV, but any guidance to achieving this goal would be appreciated.</p>
