<p>I'm looking for a way to determine the rectangle of a given word or phrase in an image.</p>  <p>For example, <em>given an image and the word "test", the location is: x: 100, y:50, w:65, h:24</em> </p>  <p>Can anybody recommend an OCR library that will let me search for a given phrase in this way? </p>  <p>There's no need to run a full OCR on the image, all I need is to find one word.</p>  <p>Ideally there would be an Objective C or Swift API for it.</p>
