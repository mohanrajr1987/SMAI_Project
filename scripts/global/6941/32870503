<p>I downloaded the ImageProcessor library using nuget for c#.  I am using it to upload and resize image for a website.  The upload process works fine except, when I try to view the uploaded image it appears backward rotated 90 from the original image.  Here is the code that I am using:</p>  <pre><code>        ISupportedImageFormat format = new JpegFormat { Quality = 70 };          using (MemoryStream inStream = new MemoryStream(_img))         {             using (MemoryStream outStream = new MemoryStream())             {                 // Initialize the ImageFactory using the overload to preserve EXIF metadata.                 using (ImageFactory imageFactory = new ImageFactory(preserveExifData: false))                 {                     // Load, resize, set the format and quality and save an image.                     imageFactory.Load(inStream)                         .Resize(new ResizeLayer(new Size(width, height), resizeMode: resizeMode))                                 .Format(format)                                 .Save(outStream);                 }                  return outStream.ToArray();             }         } </code></pre>
