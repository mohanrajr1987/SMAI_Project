<p>Im working on an application that should allow the user to select two X Ray images and perform bone segmentation on them and then register these two images.. since i want to learn more about registration algorithm i do not want to spend more time one developing the GUI and the segmentation code... I came across this open source software called ITK-SNAP that has good segmentation techniques....Is there any way i can use this segmentation algo and GUI code from ITK-SNAP and add my registration code to it...if it not possible using ITK-SNAP are there any other such open source software available so that i can avoid spending time in coming up with an efficient segmentation algorithm and GUI.. and spend more time experimenting with registration algo.....please advice....thank you.. regards vis </p>
