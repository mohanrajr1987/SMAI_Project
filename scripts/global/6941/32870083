<p>I've been trying to implement a neural network in Matlab that is capable of recognizing images based on their features. I am attempting to use the Bag of features/words approach to obtain a discrete vector of features that I can then feed into my neural network. </p>  <p>I have been using this example as a guide - <a href="http://in.mathworks.com/help/vision/examples/image-category-classification-using-bag-of-features.html" rel="nofollow">http://in.mathworks.com/help/vision/examples/image-category-classification-using-bag-of-features.html</a></p>  <p>One line in the code (featureVector = encode(bag, img);) counts the word occurrences in an image. Could I use this "featurevector" matrix to train my neural network? And would I have to encode every single image in my training set?</p>
