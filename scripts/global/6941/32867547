<p>I would like to compare <a href="http://i104.photobucket.com/albums/m198/z4xz4x/fused.jpg" rel="nofollow">"pic"</a> to a set of <code>n</code> no. of images (e.g. <a href="http://i104.photobucket.com/albums/m198/z4xz4x/Image1.png" rel="nofollow">Img1</a>) using mean luminance to find the best fit.</p>  <p>I know that I have to make use of <code>mean2(rgb2gray(pic))</code> to get the mean luminance. However, I have no idea how to split <strong>pic</strong> into the different parts as shown in <strong>Img1</strong> to calculate the mean luminance in each parts. I would also like to compare the mean luminance in each parts of <strong>"pic"</strong> to the ones in <strong>Img1:n</strong> and stop when it found the closest match.</p>  <p>Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.</p>
