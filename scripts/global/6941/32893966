<p>OpenCV has capapabilities to compensate for distortion in patterns, such as a this board, for example:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/OYYuE.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/OYYuE.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Every example I ever saw for this process does it with grids or squares. I would like to know if something similar exists for a single circle. My practical case is that I detect an ellipse, and I need to calculate the angle between the plane of this ellipse and the projection plane where the ellipse is projected as a circle. I managed to achieve that in my own code, but I would like to know if there is something built into the library to that purpose.</p>
