<p>I'm following up on this post <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22260127/where-in-flask-gunicorn-to-initialize-application">where-in-flask-gunicorn-to-initialize-application</a>.  Specifically, I'm looking for what is the best pattern of initializing a connection pool (REDIS in my example) inside a Flask-Gunicorn application. Relating to the above link, I can put a setup code. Having said that - for every worker in Gunicorn this code will re-run. Is this the proper strategy of working with connection pools?  There's also the possibility of of using the preload_app configuration, but I do wish to maintain the convenient application reloading.</p>  <p>I think my question can be generalized to - "what is the best pattern in flask/gunicorn for having an initializing code running only once for all workers?" (something a-la singleton).</p>  <p>Thanks! </p>
