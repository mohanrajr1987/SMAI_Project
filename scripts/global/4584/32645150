<p>My task is to write a program that takes three inputs and gives back three values. The entirety of the program is here:</p>  <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;       int findPercent(int percent)     {     int p = percent / 100;     return p;     }      double convertSquareYards(int a)     {     double sy = a * 4840;     return sy;     }      double convertCubicYards(double sy, double i, int p)     {     double cy = (sy * p) * (i / 36);     return cy;     }      double convertGallons(double cy)     {     double g = cy / 201.974026;     return g;     }      double convertPounds(double g)     {     double lb = g / 8.3430;     return lb;     }      double convertTonnes(double lb)     {     double t = lb / 2000;     return t;     }      double convertCubicFeet(double cy)     {     double cf = cy * 27;     return cf;     }      double findHeight(double cf)     {     double h = ((cf / (360 * 160)) / 5280);     return h;     }      int main(void)     {      double g, t, h, lb, i, cy, a, percent, cf;      printf("What is the size of the county in acres? ");     scanf("%lf", &amp;a);      printf("How much rainfall was recieved, in inches? ");     scanf("%lf", &amp;i);      printf("What percent of the county recieved rainfall? ");     scanf("%lf", &amp;percent);       g = convertGallons(cy);     t = convertTonnes(lb);     h = findHeight(cf);      printf("%lf gallons fell in the county.\n", g);     printf("The rainfall weighed %lf tonnes.\n", t);     printf("The height of the football field is %lf miles.\n", h);      return 0;     } </code></pre>  <p>When i try to compile this program i get the following errors:</p>  <pre><code>project.c:67:3: warning: ‘cy’ is used uninitialized in this function [-Wuninitialized] g = convertGallons(cy);   ^ project.c:68:3: warning: ‘lb’ is used uninitialized in this function [-Wuninitialized] t = convertTonnes(lb);   ^ project.c:69:3: warning: ‘cf’ is used uninitialized in this function [-Wuninitialized] h = findHeight(cf);   ^ </code></pre>  <p>I'm sure there are plenty things wrong with this program (it's my first real program), and if you'd like I'd love to hear any additional inputs. Thank you in advance. </p>
