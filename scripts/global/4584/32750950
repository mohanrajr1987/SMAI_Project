<p>I think thats my question? Basically this code won't work no matter how many ways I try it. The state won't set to the given array. </p>  <pre><code>if(difficulty == "easy")  {     state= new int[] {1,3,4,8,6,2,7,0,5};     blankTile = 7;     Node start = new Node(difficulty,state,blankTile);     openList.add(start);  }  else if(difficulty == "medium")  {     state= new int[] {2,8,1,0,4,3,7,6,5};     blankTile = 3;     Node start = new Node(difficulty,state,blankTile);     openList.add(start);  }  else if(difficulty == "hard")  {     state= new int[] {2,8,1,4,6,3,0,7,5};     blankTile = 6;     Node start = new Node(difficulty,state,blankTile);     openList.add(start);   }  else if(difficulty == "worst"){       state= new int[] {5,6,7,4,0,8,3,2,1};     blankTile = 4;     Node start = new Node(difficulty,state,blankTile);     openList.add(start);  } </code></pre>  <p>I had this in the constructor of Node at first, where I would just pass in difficulty and it would set the state and blankTile in the constructor. but that wasn't working either. Would somebody be kind enough to help me?</p>
