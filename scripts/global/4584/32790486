<p>This is in reference to C++.  This question I have goes back about 6 months, when I used to think that a declaration was:</p>  <p>int a;</p>  <p>And a definition was:</p>  <p>a = 5;  </p>  <p>Also, that:</p>  <p>int a = 5;</p>  <p>Was both a declaration and definition.</p>  <p>I've now come to understand that:</p>  <p>int a;</p>  <p>Is a definition, not just a declaration. (I don't know why).</p>  <p>Also, there are terms such as assigning, and initialising which add further jargon to the issue. </p>  <p>So here is my current understanding (and please correct anything):</p>  <p>int a; // Declaration and definition</p>  <p>int a = 5 // Declaration, definition, assignation and initialisation.</p>  <p>a = 5; // Initialising (if for the first time), assigning (if for subsequent times), defining (not sure about this one).</p>  <p>I have read quite a bit on this topic but am still confused.  Can someone explain exactly what each is?  I know that in such cases there are philosophical disputes, like is zero an even number, or even a number.  Haha, but can someone try?  Thanks.  </p>
