<p>I have a class and a factory function that creates new anonymous class objects extending that class.  However, the anonymous class objects all have a method in which there are references to other objects.  In my full program, I need this to create and combine parsers, but I've stripped down the code here.</p>  <pre><code>class Base{     public Base run(){         return null;     }        static Base factory(final Base n){         return new Base(){             public Base run(){                 return n;             }         };     } }  public class CircularReferences{     public static void main(String args[]){         final Base a, b;         a = Base.factory(b);         b = Base.factory(a);     } } </code></pre>  <p>I get <code>CircularReferences.java:17; error: variable b might not have been initialized</code>.  That's true, it wasn't, but can't I set aside space for these variables and then initialize them using references to these spaces, which will be filled with the proper values before they are ever actually used?  Can I perhaps use <code>new</code> separately from the constructor?  How can I create these variables so they reference each other?</p>
