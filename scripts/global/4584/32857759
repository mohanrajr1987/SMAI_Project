<p>I am somewhat new to computer science and I have written a project that uses a lot of variables.  I have all the code in the main method and at the beginning of the main method, I have most of my variables declared.  I think this is pretty ugly.  I don't want to change around my whole code and mess with the scope.  Is there a way to declare these same variables and have it look more efficient/professional?</p>  <pre><code>int numPlain; int numPepperoni; int pizzasOrdered = 0; int slicesOrdered = 0; int charmsOrdered = 0; int totalSlices = 0; int totalCharms = 0; int totalPlain = 0; int totalPepperoni = 0; double plainCost = 0.0; double pepperoniCost = 0.0; double sliceCost = 0.0; double pieCost = 0.0; double charmCost = 0.0; boolean flag = true; double totalCost = 0.00; double paymentAmt = 0.0; int numPies = 0; </code></pre>
