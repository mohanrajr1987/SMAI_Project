<p>I have an array of 3 elements. But I only want to initialize 2 of them. I let the third element blank.</p>  <pre><code>unsigned char array[3] = {1,2,}; int main(){   printf("%d",array[2]);     return 0; } </code></pre>  <p>The print result is 0. I tested it on IAR, and some online compiler.</p>  <p>Is there any C rule for the value of third element? Is there any compiler filling the third element by 0xFF ? (Especially cross compiler)</p>
