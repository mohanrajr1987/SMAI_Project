<p>I want to initialize Log4j basically as the first thing in an EAR application, so that all other modules and classes can use the logger.</p>  <p>How can I do this?</p>  <p>I have an EAR with a WAR and multible EJB jars. At the moment, I am initializing it in a <code>init()</code> method of a Servlet, but I appear to have classes (e.g. Timers) that are loaded and initialized before that.</p>  <p>I need to initialize Log4j programmatically because I want to provide a custom location for the Log4j config file. I can't pass the file in via config parameters during app server or container startup.</p>  <p>The app server is Websphere 8.5, but a general standards-compliant solution is preferred.</p>
