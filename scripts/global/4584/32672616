<p>Like the title says, I'm wondering why the default value in a next expression is initialized regardless of it being used. An example of this is below.</p>  <pre><code>class Test(object):     def __init__(self):         print("Test object created") print(next((i for i in range(1)), Test())) </code></pre>  <p>Previously I would have thought this to only print out <code>0</code> and not <code>Test object created</code> as well as <code>0</code>. I recently found out this wasn't the case through a bug caused by this behavior. </p>  <p>Is there some reason for this? Was this a design decision?</p>
