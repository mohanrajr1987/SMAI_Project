<p>I'm trying to create a view to see/change some application settings inside my application (VS2013). I want to visualize them inside a gridview or a listview. I create a ViewModel for each setting.</p>  <p>The application settings are created with the C# designer, the .config is fine every thing seems to work except one thing.</p>  <p>My class have 2 settings for now and i can access them with this code:</p>  <pre><code>MyCustomSetting.Properties.Settings.Default["MaxNumberOfResultBlocks"]; </code></pre>  <p>But i don't want to have to write the name for each  setting. So i use a loop to create a viewmodel for each setting. All I need is the following classes ApplicationSettingsBase and SettingsPropertyValue.</p>  <pre><code>List&lt;ApplicationSettingsBase&gt; appBaseList = new List&lt;ApplicationSettingsBase&gt;();  // Add Settings we want to show here: appBaseList.Add(MyCustomSetting.Properties.Settings.Default as ApplicationSettingsBase);  foreach (ApplicationSettingsBase app in appBaseList)     {     foreach (System.Configuration.SettingsPropertyValue v in app.PropertyValues)        {        Preferences.Add(new PreferenceViewModel(app, v));        }     } </code></pre>  <p>the object Preferences is collection of PreferenceViewModel.</p>  <p>The problems is with app.PropertyValues! The SettingsPropertyValue class is not loaded/initialize. The app.PropertyValues.Count is always 0 unless I do the following:</p>  <p>1 getting a value just for fun</p>  <pre><code>Miscellaneous.Properties.Settings.Default["MaxNumberOfResultBlocks"] </code></pre>  <p>2 in debug checking inside the value of app.PropertyValues, something happen and the values are loaded into the class.</p>
