<p>The assignment of a default constructed <code>vector&lt;int*&gt;::const_iterator</code> errors on Visual Studio 2010. I've tried this on 5 Visual Studio 2010 systems that all have Service Pack 1. It fails on 3/5 machines, I've been able to identify what is causing the failure on the 3 systems but I cannot seem to find a bug report.</p>  <p>Here is the code:</p>  <pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt; #include &lt;vector&gt;  using namespace std;  int main() {     vector&lt;int*&gt; vec;     int arr[3] = {};      for(int i = 0; i &lt; sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]); ++i) vec.push_back(arr + i);      vector&lt;int*&gt;::const_iterator initialized = vec.cbegin();     vector&lt;int*&gt;::const_iterator uninitialized;      initialized = uninitialized;      cout &lt;&lt; "Hello World" &lt;&lt; endl;      return 0; } </code></pre>  <p>Clearly everything but the <code>cout &lt;&lt; "Hello World" &lt;&lt; endl;</code> is optimized out in Release so this minimal example will only fail in Debug. But in Debug the error it gives is:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Unhandled exception at 0x01071e14 in test.exe: 0xC0000005: Access violation reading location 0x00000000.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Comparing the working and non-working MSVCP100D.dlls that were linked shows that there is a slight discrepancy, the working .dll is Product Version: 10.0.40219.325 and the non-working .dll is Product Version: 10.0.40219.1.</p>  <p>The actual error occurs in</p>  <blockquote>   <p>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\include\xutility</p> </blockquote>  <p>And again diffing the working and non-working version shows that a change has been made to the working version. The non-working code simply says:</p>  <pre><code>if (_Myproxu != _Right._Myproxy)     _Adopt(_Right._Myproxy-&gt;_Mycont); </code></pre>  <p>The working code says:</p>  <pre><code>if (_Myproxy == _Right._Myproxy)     ; else if (_Right._Myproxy != 0)     _Adopt(_Right._Myproxy-&gt;_Mycont); else     {   // becoming invalid, disown current parent     _Lockit _Lock(_LOCK_DEBUG);     _Orphan_me();     } </code></pre>  <p>All that to say, here's my actual question. How do I get this update? I've updated to the latest using Windows Update, but the problem has not been resolved. Is there some hidden patch that I need to go somewhere to get? I can't find this issue written up anywhere, so I also can't find information about the patch.</p>
