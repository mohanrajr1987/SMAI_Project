<p>I have a class that only needs to be initialized once in my code, but the function it is in is called multiple times and the class is initialized again and again. This class only needs to be called once because the data that is passed into it never changes and it is a waste to have my code reinitialize it more than once. I want to have a way for my code to check that this class has already been initialized and can grab the needed information that was already generated. My first thought was to design in the way of the Singleton Pattern, but I don't think that's necessary since this class is not needed anywhere else in my code. What is a simple way of doing something like this?</p>
