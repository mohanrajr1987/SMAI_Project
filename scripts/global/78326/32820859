<p>Let me setup the question with a simple case.</p>  <p>I have an HTML table, the rows of which are controlled by an observableArray. It works great.</p>  <p>If the observableArray has zero elements in it however, I want a single row to say so.  I tried this markup, which "kind of" works:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;tbody data-bind="if: $root.data.contacts().length == 0"&gt;     &lt;tr&gt;         &lt;td&gt;There are no contacts specified yet.&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt;  &lt;tbody data-bind="foreach: $root.data.contacts"&gt;         SNIP - a tbody with the rows is here when elements &gt; zero &lt;/tbody&gt; </code></pre>  <p>When I say "kind of", I mean VISIBLY.  It really does show up at zero elements and really does go away at > zero elements like what you would expect. However when you open the DOM inspector (dev tools) and look at the DOM in memory, you find that there are TWO <em>tbody</em> sections, not one. Now one <em>tbody</em> is always empty of course, but <del>two <em>tbody</em> tags is not HTML5 correct, so this must be fixed</del> this is not the desired markup.</p>  <p>Being a Knockout newbie, I tried to fix this problem with a virtual element:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;!-- ko if: $root.data.contacts().length == 0 --&gt; &lt;tbody&gt;     &lt;tr&gt;         &lt;td&gt;There are no contacts specified yet.&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt; &lt;!-- /ko --&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Unfortunately this doesn't work for our build process: we minify HTML prior to compression and comments get eliminated.</p>  <p>I was under the impression that KO bindings applied to the CONTAINER ELEMENT ITSELF as well as descendants, but this seems to not be so.  Is there a way to tell KO to apply to container elements as well as children, or do I need to change the markup in some way OTHER THAN a virtual container?</p>
