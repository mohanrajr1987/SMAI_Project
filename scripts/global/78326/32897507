<p>Let's say I have an observable array. This is array contains items which populate a <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> list. Is there any way for an option to know whether it is the currently selected option, and to dynamically set the value observable based on that?</p>  <p><code>item.isSelected(true)</code></p>  <p>I know I could probably make some sort of janky ko.computed with a for each loop to compare what's selected with the items in my array then return true as value or something. Just wondering if there's something more elegant/concise.</p>  <p>With a checkbox it's simple:</p>  <p><code>data-bind="checked: isSelected"</code></p>  <p>Looking for something as tidy.</p>
