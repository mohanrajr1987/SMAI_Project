<p>Does the knockout validation library has changed? I've searched all over and I've found that for "initialize" knockout validation we must call something like that:</p>  <pre><code>ko.validation.init({ parseInputAttributes: true, writeInputAttributes: true }); </code></pre>  <p>or</p>  <pre><code>ko.validation.configuration({ registerExtenders: true, messagesOnModified: true, insertMessages: true, parseInputAttributes: true, messageTemplate: null }); </code></pre>  <p>But, after I installed the plugin via NuGet, I typed</p>  <pre><code>ko.validation. </code></pre>  <p>and neither the "init" or "configure" method showed up.</p>  <p>And when I run the application, the Chrome JS console shows me an error: "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'init' of undefined" and a red line under ".init({ parseInputAttributes: true, writeInputAttributes: true });" and, of course, the validation is not working.</p>  <p>So this tells me that the knockout library has changed OR I'm missing something big here.</p>  <p>PS: I would have sent you guys screenshots of my issues, but I must have at least 10 reputation to post images and that is my first question :)</p>
