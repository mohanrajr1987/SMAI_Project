<p>I have a form used to create a call support in which I have two dates fields, one is X and another one Y .if I entered a Y date earlier then the X date a validation message would display alerting you to the error, and you would not be able to save the event. Now the validation message is not displayed and I can save the event with a Y date  before the X date.</p>  <p>Expected Result: - Validations to display and you cannot save until the error is fixed</p>  <p>How Can I do validations on those two dates in using knockout.js or javascript?</p>
