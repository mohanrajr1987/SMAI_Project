<p>I'm wondering if it is possible to get the <code>event</code> parameter in the <code>subscribe</code> function of knockout.js.</p>  <pre><code>self.selectedOrder.subscribe(function(newValue, action) {     shouter.notifySubscribers(newValue, "selectedOrder"); }); </code></pre>  <p>I have a table with rows and I would like to notify other viewmodels when the user clicks over a row to select it. </p>  <p>I need the <code>event</code> parameter to get the <code>$(event.currentTarget)</code> element and highlight the row by adding a CSS class. </p>  <pre><code>$(event.currentTarget).addClasss('selected').siblings().removeClass('selected'); </code></pre>  <p>I was thinking about doing it directly with KO, but I didn't find a proper way. It doesn't seem easy...</p>  <p><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/vhwk1gvy/9/" rel="nofollow">This was my try with KO</a>. Basically:</p>  <pre><code>data-bind="css: {'selected':  $parent.selectedUser().id == id}" </code></pre>  <p>Which of course, was throwing errors when <code>selectedUser</code> was null.</p>  <p>After reading <a href="http://www.knockmeout.net/2011/08/simplifying-and-cleaning-up-views-in.html" rel="nofollow">this article</a> about <em>protecting against null objects</em>, I just though KO is not as easy as jQuery for this task. So I believe I will go for the traditional jQuery in this case as it is much straight forward. </p>  <p>The problem is, I still need the <code>event</code> object.</p>
