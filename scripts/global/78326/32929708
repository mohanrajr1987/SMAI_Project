<p>For our latest projects, we've used MVC5 with Angularjs+Ninject+Bootstrap and other techs, and we have ended up with applications that take us a long time to fix bugs and add features, with more tiers (and tears) than necessary.</p>  <p>Is it viable to make Pure HTML apps (with Jquery, Bootstrap and just other minor plugins) that simply connect via $.ajax to functions placed in Controllers that interact with the Model/DB?  </p>  <p>Will I go to developer hell for trying to build "pseudo" SPAs without Angularjs or Knockout and just do Raw DOM manipulations? </p>  <p>Also will I be able to keep my applications secure?</p>  <p>Any tips or references? </p>
