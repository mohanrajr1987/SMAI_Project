<p>In the following code <code>pVM.People</code> and <code>pVM.PeopleSelected</code> are observable arrays.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;tbody data-bind="foreach: pVM.People"&gt;   &lt;tr&gt;     &lt;td&gt;&lt;input type="checkbox" data-bind="checkedValue: $data, checked: pVM.PeopleSelected" /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td data-bind="text: $data.Name"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;   &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tbody&gt; </code></pre>  <p>When I check a box, all the boxes get selected, and if I look into the chrome javascript console, my array prints <code>["on"]</code> instead of having the objects in the list <code>pVM.People</code>.</p>  <p>I made a small thing in JSFiddle and the code works fine, so I know there is something more complex going on that is not being represented in the above code. However, the application is very large, and I am not even sure what to look for.</p>  <p>Can anyone point me in the right direction on why the objects are being converted to <code>"on"</code> when I check the boxes?</p>
