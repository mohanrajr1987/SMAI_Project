<p><strong>I want to implement using Knockout something easily reusable (probably, custom binding) that could apply mix of standard bindings: the <code>foreach</code> binding to a <code>tbody</code> node and another standard bindings (<code>visible</code> and <code>css</code>) to its <code>tr</code> child nodes.</strong></p>  <p>AFAIK, the best way it can be achieved is to write a custom binding.<br> I want to use it like that:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;table&gt;     &lt;tbody data-bind="tableRows: { rows: unfilteredItems, filter: rowFilter }"&gt;         &lt;tr data-bind="possibly, some hard coded bindings including visible and css bindings"&gt;...&lt;/tr&gt;     &lt;/tbody&gt; &lt;/table&gt; </code></pre>  <p>, where <code>unfilteredItems</code> and <code>rowFilter</code> are some <code>observables</code>.</p>  <p>I want the custom binding to 'transform' this into the following and let KO process this as it was initially in the layout:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;table&gt;     &lt;tbody data-bind="foreach: unfilteredItems"&gt;         &lt;tr data-bind="visible: rowFilter($data), css: rowClass($data), and now hard coded bindings, if any"&gt;...&lt;/tr&gt;     &lt;/tbody&gt; &lt;/table&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Here <code>rowClass()</code> is a function contained in the component and just returns a string that should be appended to the <code>tr</code>'s <code>class</code> attribute based on the current <code>$data</code>.</p>  <p>I know how to apply the <code>foreach</code> binding to the node that my binding is applied to:</p>  <pre><code>ko.bindingHandlers.tableRows = {     init: function (element, valueAccessor, allBindings, viewModel, bindingContext) {         var options = valueAccessor(),             rows = options.rows;          ko.applyBindingsToNode(element, { foreach: rows }, bindingContext);     } }; </code></pre>  <p>This part is working perfectly.</p>  <p>But I can't find anywhere <strong>how to add bindings to the child <code>tr</code> nodes, so that when the <code>foreach</code> binding would process child nodes, that bindings (and all bindings that already contained in the child layout) were applied to and processed in the same manner as they were initially in the layout.</strong></p>  <p>I could try to manually add the required bindings to the child <code>tr</code> nodes as a string in the <code>init</code> function using JS DOM API, but I have feeling that it should be cleaner solution using some KO API.</p>  <p>Also, I need the custom binding to properly handle cases when there initially are another bindings on the <code>tr</code> nodes including both <code>visible</code> and <code>css</code> bindings.</p>  <p>My project uses Knockout 2.2.1 and it would be nice if the solution doesn't rely on the Knockout 3 features, if possible.</p>  <p>Could someone suggest how to achieve this?</p>
