<p>I try to serve 2 web applications that should be powered by hhvm. It is easy to build up one docker image that includes nginx and the default.conf. But now where I will get <code>n</code> apps as microservices I want to test them and share the nginx container as I proceed with others like DB e.g.</p>  <p>So when nginx is externally accessed with hhvm do I have to provide hhvm on this image too? Or can I refer it to the debian where hhvm is already provided? Then, I could store the <code>nginx.conf</code> with something like this:</p>  <pre><code>upstream api.local.io {    server 127.0.0.1:3000; }  upstream booking.local.io {    server 127.0.0.1:5000; } </code></pre>  <p>How can I set up a proper nginx container for this?</p>
