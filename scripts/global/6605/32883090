<p>I deployed my rails app on AWS instance which is working fine if I change the environment to development instead of production in the <code>.conf</code> file of nginx.</p>  <p>Following is the output of <code>production.log</code> content </p>  <pre><code>I, [2015-10-01T08:22:36.180713 #3376]  INFO -- : Started GET "/" for 123.252.135.162 at 2015-10-01 08:22:36 +0000 F, [2015-10-01T08:22:36.201807 #3376] FATAL -- :  ActionController::RoutingError (No route matches [GET] "/"): </code></pre>  <p>Following is the content of <code>production.rb</code> file</p>  <pre><code># config.serve_static_files = ENV['RAILS_SERVE_STATIC_FILES'].present? config.serve_static_files = true  # Compress JavaScripts and CSS. config.assets.js_compressor = :uglifier # config.assets.css_compressor = :sass  # Do not fallback to assets pipeline if a precompiled asset is missed. config.assets.compile = true  # Asset digests allow you to set far-future HTTP expiration dates on all assets, # yet still be able to expire them through the digest params. config.assets.digest = true </code></pre>  <p>I tried running </p>  <pre><code>RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake assets:precompile </code></pre>  <p>which generated the assets folder in public directory. But still when I access the url of my app, it shows the page you are looking for doesn't exist.</p>
