<p>I have this at the beginning of my server block to restrict a folder:</p>  <pre><code>location /panel {     auth_basic "Restricted";     auth_basic_user_file /home/mypath/.htaccess; } </code></pre>  <p>Then I have many other rules after that which also apply to that directory, but it seems they are not working when i have the above block. is it possible to tell nginx to run this location block but also run any other blocks that may effect this directory?</p>
