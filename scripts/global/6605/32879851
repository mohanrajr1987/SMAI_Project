<p>Coming from Django I'm accustomed to serving my static assets and media (including uploads) separately from the main wsgi or other app.</p>  <p>I can't seem to find any examples of how to do this with Meteor.</p>  <p>Is there a standard approach?</p>  <p>Are there packages that provide this functionality?</p>  <p>My end goals are:</p>  <p>1) to be able to more intuitively navigate all the static assets and media and access them from a publicly accessible URL without having to rebuild the meteor app. The "public" folder doesn't do it for me... especially for uploaded media.</p>  <p>2) upload to this system path (which is separate from the main meteor app) either manually when migrating an app or via a custom app/package I write.</p>  <p>3) browse/parse the path from meteor app/package</p>
