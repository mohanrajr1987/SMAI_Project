<p>This is my first rails production server, so bare with me. I'm hosting a Rails 4 app on an ec2 instance and using Nginx, I added a view to a controller and was getting an error trying to navigate to the page through my browser till I reloaded nginx.conf. Once it came up I made some changes to the view but those weren't showing either till I reloaded nginx.conf again.</p>  <p>Obviously I don't want to reload nginx.conf every time I need to change a view. Is there something I'm missing to make this easier on myself?</p>  <p>Here is my nginx.conf file.</p>  <pre><code>server {     listen       80;     server_name  app-on-rails;     passenger_enabled on;     #charset koi8-r;      #access_log  logs/host.access.log  main;      root   /home/usr/www/app-on-rails/welcome;     index index.html.erb; } </code></pre>  <p>My environments/production.rb file</p>  <pre><code>Rails.application.configure do   config.cache_classes = true   config.eager_load = true   config.consider_all_requests_local       = false   config.action_controller.perform_caching = true   config.serve_static_files = false   config.assets.js_compressor = :uglifier   config.assets.compile = true </code></pre>
