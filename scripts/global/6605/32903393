<p>I have a web app running on port 8081. I want to use nginx to redirect incoming http traffic to this port. So I have this configuration</p>  <pre><code>server {     listen 80;     server_name myserver.thing.com;      location / {         proxy_set_header   X-Real-IP $remote_addr;         proxy_set_header   Host      $http_host;         proxy_pass         http://127.0.0.1:8081;     } } </code></pre>  <p>When I try to open the address, I get a <code>ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED</code> error. </p>  <p>However, if I change the port to, say, 81 and connect there, <strong>everything goes smoothly</strong>. I don't understand why. There is nothing running on the machine, only nginx and Artifactory. Firewall is turned off for the time being.</p>  <p>Is there a problem with interacting on port 80? What can cause this?</p>  <hr>  <p>EDIT</p>  <p>I have been using this nginx a few days ago to redirect from 80 to 443 and then from 443 to 8081. (http -> https -> 8081). For debugging purposes now I want to ignore https.</p>  <p>However, for some reason, the port 80 seems to be still redirected to 443, despite no such config being there for nginx.</p>  <p>...</p>  <p>Turns out there must have been a cached redirect in Chrome (originally when the web was visited on port 80 I returned a 301 redirect to port 443. This must've been saved, because when I open an incognito window, it works as expected. </p>
