<p>I am running a PHP application on nginx with HHVM as main and PHP-FPM as backup</p>  <p>This is my config of nginx regarding the php processing</p>  <pre><code>  location ~ \.(hh|php)$ {     fastcgi_intercept_errors on;     error_page 500 501 502 503 = @fallback;      try_files $uri =404;      fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\.php)(/.+)$;      fastcgi_keep_conn on;      include         fastcgi_params;     fastcgi_index   index.php;     fastcgi_param   SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;     fastcgi_param   SERVER_NAME $host;     fastcgi_pass    127.0.0.1:9000;   }    location @fallback {      try_files $uri =404;      fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\.php)(/.+)$;      include         fastcgi_params;     fastcgi_index   index.php;     fastcgi_param   SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;     fastcgi_param   SERVER_NAME $host;     fastcgi_pass    unix:/var/run/php5-fpm.sock;    } </code></pre>  <p>To test the config,I stopped the hhvm service.Normally that would pass the request to PHP-FPM and should return 200 but I am getting 502 error as follows :</p>  <pre><code>12296#0: *17 connect() failed (111: Connection refused) while connecting to upstream, client: 172.31.34.235, server: stylep3.com, request: "GET / HTTP/1.1", upstream: "fastcgi://127.0.0.1:9000", host:localhost </code></pre>  <p>Am I doing anything wrong here</p>
