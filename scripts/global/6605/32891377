<p>I've migrated my site and now got a huge list of links that I need to redirect to their corresponding new urls. I'm not a developer or sys admin and can't really help myself with the Nginx manuals.</p>  <p>A short snippet of my list looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>rewrite /?tn=productview&amp;c=34223&amp;pid=8965214 /url1 permanent; rewrite /?tn=productview&amp;c=54424&amp;pid=6180497 /url2 permanent; rewrite /?tn=productview&amp;c=54426&amp;pid=2563446 /url3 permanent; rewrite /?tn=productview&amp;c=54426&amp;pid=6889674 /url4 permanent; </code></pre>  <p>The problem is that Nginx will in that particular case redirect the first line correctly and all following lines to "url1".</p>  <p>How should I write this so that each of this links be redirected to their corresponding new url?</p>
