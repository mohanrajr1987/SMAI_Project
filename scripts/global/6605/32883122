<p>I updated my directadmin server's php version from 5.3 to 5.4 for installing last version of ioncube loader. After upgrading, I found a 500 error on webapps like phpMyAdmin, roundcube ect. I have tried many solutions such as:</p>  <ul> <li>Rebuild apache</li> <li>Checking permissions and ownership of the /var/www folder and subfolders</li> <li>Checking alias settings at the httpd.conf file and httpd-alias.conf</li> </ul>  <p>But my problem still exists. Now, when I create a html file on the /var/www/html/phpMyAdmin folder like test.html and then open myserverip/phpmyadmin/test.html, it runs. But it doesn't work with php file(test.php or phpMyAdmin's index.php) and I receive 500 error.</p>  <p>My server's specification: OS: CentOS 6.0 Webserver: nginx_apache Control Panel: Directadmin PHP version: 5.4 Apache version: 2.x</p>  <p>This is my error log file after cleaning and running this action: [Thu Oct 01 13:12:54.315024 2015] [:error] [pid 17550:tid 2582453104] [client 84.241.32.113:21899] PHP Warning:  Module 'ionCube Loader' already loaded in Unknown on l$ [Thu Oct 01 13:12:54.315196 2015] [:error] [pid 17550:tid 2582453104] [client 84.241.32.113:21899] [Thu Oct 01 13:12:54 2015] [warn-phpd] The ionCube PHP Loader is dis$ [Thu Oct 01 13:12:54.316188 2015] [core:error] [pid 17550:tid 2582453104] [client 84.241.32.113:21899] End of script output before headers: index.php</p>  <p>Thanks a lot.</p>
