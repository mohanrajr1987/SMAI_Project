<p>I am a first time user of CKAN and python, most of my development in .NET. I have installed CKAN from package on Ubuntu 12.04 and I can access to CKAN web site from <a href="http://localhost" rel="nofollow">http://localhost</a>,  however, I can't access to CKAN web site from the public IP of my server.</p>  <p>Can be a problem about Nginx or Apache configuration? How can I solve it?</p>  <p>Thanks,</p>  <p>Alfonso</p>
