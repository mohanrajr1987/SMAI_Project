<p>I am trying to configure a nginx to reject there requests if there are more than X req/per second with limit_conn_zone, and I have this line:</p>  <pre><code>limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=api:10m rate=3r/s; </code></pre>  <p>and:</p>  <pre><code>location ~ \.php$ {   limit_req zone=api ;   ... } </code></pre>  <p>Okay, from this I understand if I send 3 requests in 1 second, all will be processed. But, when I am doing </p>  <pre><code>ab -c3 -n3 http://192.168.33.20:8888/file.php </code></pre>  <p>I get:</p>  <pre><code>==&gt; /var/log/nginx/access.log &lt;== 192.168.33.1 - - [01/Oct/2015:11:27:15 +0300] "GET /file.php HTTP/1.0" 503 213 "-" "ApacheBench/2.3" 192.168.33.1 - - [01/Oct/2015:11:27:15 +0300] "GET /file.php HTTP/1.0" 503 213 "-" "ApacheBench/2.3" 192.168.33.1 - - [01/Oct/2015:11:27:25 +0300] "GET /file.php HTTP/1.0" 200 4 "-" "ApacheBench/2.3" </code></pre>  <p>But anyway, it seems only 1 request out of 3 was accepted &amp; processed.</p>  <p>I saw there's also a burst option, but the documentation is saying "Excessive requests are delayed until their number exceeds the maximum burst size" but I am not exceeding the number of requests. I am doing exactly 3 request as specified in limit_req_zone rate. </p>  <p>So, what I'm doing wrong? How can I set it up to accept exactly 3 requests/second?</p>  <p>Thank you!</p>
