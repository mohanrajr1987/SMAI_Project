<p>Can anyone tell me how I can use a result from a CONCAT as a columnname during SELECT? My attempt looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>INSERT INTO `table_1` (datum, comment) SELECT CURRENT_DATE(), CONCAT('s',DAYOFWEEK(CURRENT_DATE())-1) FROM `table_2` WHERE id = 12345 </code></pre>  <p>As a result I get <code>s0</code> - <code>s6</code> as a value in my comment field instead of the value that is actually in my 2nd table that I want to read the value from :/</p>  <p>funfact: If I just type in <code>s0</code> (as an example, works with all 7) instead of the CONCAT, it works just fine and I get the actual value that I want to.</p>  <p>Thx for your help.</p>
