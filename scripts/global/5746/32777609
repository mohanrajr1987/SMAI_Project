<p>I would like to insert a double or float number to mysql, for example <strong>2371.80</strong> €. In my country we are writting <strong>2371.80€</strong> like <strong>2.371,80€</strong>. Can I insert number like <strong>2.371,80€</strong>??</p>  <p>I know that can i use <code>str_replace()</code>  and <code>length()</code> to add or change characters, but i want to do this when run <code>insert query</code>. </p>  <p>Also i tried to change unicode but nothing.</p>  <p>Can anyone help me?</p>
