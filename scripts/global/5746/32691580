<p>I have a table into which i will insert and it has 4 columns.  While inserting 3 columns will be same and the other one column will be different for each and it will be taken from another table. How could i do that? For exmaple; INSERT INTO sendMsg (Type,Name,SenderName,Message) values(4, 'john','Mike','Hi, blabla') </p>  <p>i will insert same message also for Bob, instead of john. and the names which i will send are contained in Names table.</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
