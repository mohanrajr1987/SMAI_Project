<p>I am having trouble inserting in a BLOB field some text content (in fact it's an XML, I know there are field-types more suited than BLOB for this type of content, but I simply can't change it).</p>  <p>I have the necessity of inserting some values using simple SQL queries, I am using this syntax:</p>  <pre><code>INSERT INTO XXX.MYTABLE (MY_KEY, MY_VALUE) VALUES(0, CAST('&lt;some xml content here/&gt;' AS BLOB) ); </code></pre>  <p>The command is executed, but it stores in the database some application/octet-stream content that converted back to text appears like </p>  <blockquote>   <p>LÓ…££…™?çÔÓ£…¢£–n%L£‰—–É•„‰™‰©©–nÁLa£‰—–É•„‰™‰©©–n%L¢?“¤£‰nâ—…££K“…La¢?“¤£‰n%L–‡‡…££–nÓ…££…</p> </blockquote>  <p>I guess it is an encoding issue, but the documentation says "BLOB does not have  any Coded Character Set Identifier (CCSID) associated with the field", so I do not know how to work around this issue.</p>  <p>The DBMS is DB2 10.1</p>
