<p>My question is similar to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4693173/insert-the-same-fixed-value-into-multiple-rows">this</a>, however, the difference being I want to insert the same fixed date in a date column in N number of rows that currently do not exist in the table.</p>  <p>So:</p>  <pre><code>update mytable set date = &lt;value&gt; </code></pre>  <p>But execute the above query N number of times. </p>  <p>The restriction on the value to insert is max(date) + 1 month. The date values in the table are the first of every month. If the current date is 9/1/2015, then I want to insert 10/1/2015, N number of times, where N is dependent on another query that I will not get into details here to keep it simple.</p>  <p>Update:</p>  <p>Table Before:</p>  <pre><code>Date, City, Temperature, DewPoint, Blah, Blah, Blah 9/1/2015, Boston, 88, 72 9/1/2015, New York City, 85, 75 9/1/2015, Miami, 95, 77 ... ... ... </code></pre>  <p>Where N = number of cities that I am tracking.</p>  <p>After:</p>  <pre><code>Date, City, Temperature, DewPoint.... 9/1/2015, Boston, 88, 72 9/1/2015, New York City, 85, 75 9/1/2015, Miami, 95, 77 ... ... ... 10/1/2015, NULL, NULL, NULL 10/1/2015, NULL, NULL, NULL 10/1/2015, NULL, NULL, NULL ... ... ... </code></pre>  <p>I'm looking for 1-2 lines of sql code that achieves my objective. I do not want to write inefficiently large number of lines of code to solve what seems to me to be a simple problem.</p>
