<p>I'm attaching a database (B) to another database (A) and trying to populate an empty table in A by doing something like:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>INSERT INTO table SELECT * FROM B.table</p> </blockquote>  <p><a href="https://www.sqlite.org/lang_insert.html" rel="nofollow">SQLite's documentation</a> mentions this, but it doesn't mention any limit on the number of rows returned by the SELECT statement (or processable by an INSERT statement in this particular scenario).</p>  <p>Is there any limit on this number of rows, or can I assume that all rows returned by the SELECT query will indeed be inserted? (please note that I'm not looking for alternative ways of copying the data, I really just want to know whether or not I may bump into any unexpected limits here)</p>
