<p>I have a Mysql cursor which might have too many records, and will have some complex business logic, so I want to manipulate data and then insert in a table.</p>  <p>Please note, it's taking 70 seconds to insert 2500 records, so what would happen if I have 50000 record.</p>  <p>Below is a my procedure</p>  <pre><code>CREATE DEFINER=`root`@`localhost` PROCEDURE `new_procedure`() BEGIN DECLARE employeeId INT; DECLARE done INT DEFAULT FALSE;   -- declar cursor DECLARE cur1 CURSOR FOR SELECT      employeeId FROM     employee;   -- declare NOT FOUND handler DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR NOT FOUND SET done = TRUE;  OPEN cur1; read_loop: LOOP     FETCH cur1 INTO employeeId;     IF done THEN       LEAVE read_loop;     END IF;  INSERT INTO pricing (employeeId) VALUES(      employeeId);  END LOOP read_loop; CLOSE cur1; END </code></pre>
