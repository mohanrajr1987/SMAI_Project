<p>I'm new to c++ and am having a hard time understanding insertion in a linked list. Here is my insert that I've been working on so far, I'm just having trouble adding more than one node. </p>  <pre><code>struct node *temp, *x, *y; temp = create_node(a, b, c); x = begin; if (begin == NULL) {     begin = temp;     temp-&gt;next = NULL; } else {     y = temp;     temp-&gt;next = NULL; } </code></pre>
