<p>I am trying to use a macro-enabled button to insert pictures in the same Row. I use a spread sheet for work to capture facility issues, and I want to be able to add multiple pictures of these issues next to the cells which have a text explanation of the issue. Below is what I currently use, this just places one picture in Column G of the Row (Row 5 in this example)</p>  <pre><code>Sub ChangeImage() With Application.FileDialog(msoFileDialogFilePicker)     .AllowMultiSelect = False     .ButtonName = "Submit"     .Title = "Select an image file"     .Filters.Clear     .Filters.Add "JPG", "*.JPG"     .Filters.Add "JPEG File Interchange Format", "*.JPEG"     .Filters.Add "Graphics Interchange Format", "*.GIF"     .Filters.Add "Portable Network Graphics", "*.PNG"     .Filters.Add "Tag Image File Format", "*.TIFF"     .Filters.Add "All Pictures", "*.*"      If .Show = -1 Then         Dim img As Object         Set img = ActiveSheet.Pictures.Insert(.SelectedItems(1))          'Scale image size         'img.ShapeRange.ScaleWidth 0.75, msoFalse, msoScaleFromTopLeft         'img.ShapeRange.ScaleHeight 0.75, msoFalse, msoScaleFromTopLeft          'Position Image         img.Left = Range("G5").Left         img.Top = Range("G5").Top           'Set image sizes in points (72 point per inch)         img.Width = 350         img.Height = 350     Else         MsgBox ("Cancelled.")     End If End With End Sub </code></pre>  <p>I want to macro to be able to realize that pictures have already been added and to place the next picture starting at the RIGHT end of the last uploaded picture.</p>  <p>Thank you in advance,</p>
