<p>I am using MySQL. I want to insert value's result from groupby of datetime to specific column (using where, maybe). Let say: I have two tables (a, b). In table a, I want to get how many total records during a hour (which I have datetime column), then the result will insert into table b, but in specific ID (there is already exist ID's value).</p>  <p>This is my error code:</p>  <pre><code>INSERT INTO b(value) WHERE ID=15 SELECT DAY COUNT(*) FROM a WHERE date &gt;= '2015-09-19 00:00:00' AND date &lt; '2015-09-19 00:59:59' GROUP BY DAY(date),HOUR(date);"; </code></pre>  <p>Is that possible I make a query from this case? Thank you very much for any reply!</p>
