<p>I have a set of inputs that need to be set by the user before the macro will run. The inputs are stored in various cells that are called out later on in the macro. The inputs will be some assortment of either numbers, words, or punctuation (ex:  . - , *). When ever I put a "." into the input box the code stops and highlights the inputbox code. Is there something ( if statement, different type on input box) that can handle basically anything that gets thrown at it?</p>  <pre><code>Dim AN As Range Dim AO As Range Dim AP As Range      Set AN = Application.InputBox(PROMPT:="ENTER SEPERATOR AFTER BLOCK/ARRAY NUMBER", Type:=2)     Range("AN4") = AN     Set AO = Application.InputBox(PROMPT:="ENTER SEPERATOR AFTER INVERTER NUMBER", Type:=2)     Range("AO4") = AO     Set AP = Application.InputBox(PROMPT:="ENTER SEPERATOR AFTER COMBINERBOX NUMBER", Type:=2)     Range("AP4") = AP </code></pre>
