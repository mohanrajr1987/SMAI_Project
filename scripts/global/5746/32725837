<p>I'm designing the interface for text editing application using wxpython. my question is how I can do the suggestions list (clickable list) that appears to the user on the right side of the window and the user can insert the suggestion on his text by clicking on a desired suggestion. I want to do the suggestion list as the list in this link: <a href="http://www.cssnewbie.com/example/clickable-li/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cssnewbie.com/example/clickable-li/</a></p>  <p>is there any way to do such a list in python?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance. Any help I appreciated. </p>
