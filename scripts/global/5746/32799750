<p>As I changed the android version and the path from externalized to the default database-folder, I don't know where the error come from. I found that the reason might be problems accessing the journal file is locked (it is created by the program).</p>  <p>the "test" is reading data and if it exists it updates and if not it inserts. This is done in a loop while reading lines from a file. For testing purpose i simplified it but the error is the same.</p>  <pre><code>package ...; import android.database.Cursor; import android.database.sqlite.SQLiteDatabase; public class test {     public test(SQLiteDatabase MyDB)     {         MyDB.execSQL("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS testtable (mytext TEXT, number INT PRIMARY KEY)", new String[] {});         for (int i = 1; i &lt; 5; i++)         {             String[] ColArray = { "any text", String.valueOf(i) };             Cursor readCursor = MyDB.rawQuery("SELECT mytext FROM testtable WHERE number=?", new String[] { String.valueOf(i) });             if (!readCursor.moveToNext()) // Error when executing moveToNext /*     In the 2nd time it runs over this point an Error occurs:     android.database.sqlite.SQLiteCantOpenDatabaseException: unable to open database file (code 14)     I need to remove the journal file to be able to connect to the database it again - the change made by the Insert/Update is successfully saved! */          {                 readCursor.close();                 MyDB.execSQL("INSERT INTO testtable (mytext, number) VALUES(?, ?)", ColArray);             }             else {                 readCursor.close();                 MyDB.execSQL("UPDATE testtable SET mytext=? WHERE number=?", ColArray);             }         }     } } </code></pre>  <p>MyDB is a valid DB-Connection. 1) The Table is created 2) The Table is READ but Line 1 is not found 2a) READ again is possible until now if the read is closed. 3) Line 1 is INSERTED 4) when trying to READ again (the line 2 would not be found, too), moving the cursor fails.</p>  <p>The journalfile need to be deleted manually or the app will fail to start again when trying to connect.</p>  <p>Please Help! Thank you.</p>
