<p>Weird one. We have two sites running on the same server, two different domains. One we use as a sort of development site, while the other is live production. I went through the process of upgrading the dev site to latest Drupal everything went fine. This was both an update to minor version and then upgrade to major (6.x to 7.x). However, when I went back to our production version, which I hadn't touched, it was broken. Both databases sit on a single MySQL install. I had to restore the DB on the production site, and once I did, it worked again, but the dev site did not. Is it possible that the Drupal update procedure is making changes to both databases, hence breaking the prod version which still has the old drupal version?</p>
