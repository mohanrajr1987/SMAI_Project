<p>I have just taken over a drupal 6 website and need to change a link from an image. </p>  <p>the image is a menu item , but that menu items Path does not change when i change it in the backend. I assume the whole file has been over written but i am not sure where to find this file. I have looked in the "Bartik" themes file with all the .tpl.php files but i cant find anything.</p>  <p>Any help please</p>
