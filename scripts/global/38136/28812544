<p>We're running version 6.14 of Drupal (old, I know). On of our users recently deleted a block by accident in a series of rotating images. (Administer > site building > block). So now the block shows up as a blank, or "n/a". </p>  <p>She did manage to add another block in its place, but apparently that doesn't help - the n/a still displays. What is the solution to this problem? </p>
