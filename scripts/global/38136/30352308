<p>I'm new to the Drupal environment and I'm looking to upgrade a website from Drupal 6 to Drupal 7. I would like to know if I am able to use Backup and Migrate module to back up Drupal 6 and restore in Drupal 7?</p>  <p>If not, I'm aware of Migrate and Drupal-to-Drupal data migration modules. Are there any recommendations for an easy migration? The website itself has many content types, blocks, views, and content. </p>
