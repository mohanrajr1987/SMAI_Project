<p>After many hours of thorough search i couldn't find anything that works. The following article <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/1338672" rel="nofollow">https://www.drupal.org/node/1338672</a> shows how to patch the recaptcha library to support proxy configuration but it doesn't work at all. I should fix my issue cause my server for safety reason does not allow direct connections with google recaptcha api and for that a proxy configuration for my recaptcha drupal module is needed.  </p>
