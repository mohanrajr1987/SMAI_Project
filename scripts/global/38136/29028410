<p>Since few days ago Structure admin page (admin/build) is not accessible for super admin. When I try to open it I get error message:</p>  <pre><code>Access denied. You are not authorized to access this page. </code></pre>  <p>It worked well last week. On permissions page absolutely everything is allowed for super admin. Staging server (which is a copy of live server) is still working well. Site is running on drupal 6.19 and have a lot of modules, which makes it impossible to update.</p>  <p>Any idea what can cause this? What could admin do to cause this issue?</p>
