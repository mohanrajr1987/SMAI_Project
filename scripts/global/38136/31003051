<p>I have a drupal 6 installation with a bunch of webforms i need my users to complete.</p>  <p>My aim to to show a list of webforms in a table with submission dates and a col stating Complete or Not Complete.</p>  <p>This is where im at...  I thought it was working until i submitted the forms as a test user and the table changed for everyone as NULL is no longer found once the form has been submitted by anyone.</p>  <p>I pretty much want to search and list all forms with SSOW in the title that exist and show if the current logged in user has completed them or not.  I tried to achive this with views before i went down this route, but no luck there either</p>  <p>thanks in advance for anyone who might take a look</p>  <pre><code>$sql = "SELECT node.nid AS 'page', node.title AS 'webform', IFNULL(FROM_UNIXTIME(webform_submissions.submitted), '') AS 'subdate', IF(webform_submissions.submitted IS NULL, 'NOT COMPLETED', 'COMPLETED') AS 'status' FROM node LEFT OUTER JOIN webform_submissions ON node.nid = webform_submissions.nid LEFT OUTER JOIN users ON webform_submissions.uid = users.uid WHERE node.title LIKE '%SIGNOFF%' AND node.type LIKE 'webform' AND   (webform_submissions.uid IS NULL OR webform_submissions.uid LIKE '$user-&gt;uid')";  $res = db_query($sql); $table_rows = array(); while ($row = db_fetch_object($res)) { $table_rows[] = array(   'data' =&gt; array( // Column 1 'Webform'   =&gt; array('data'  =&gt; l($row-&gt;webform, 'node/' .  $row-&gt;page), 'class' =&gt; 'col-title', ), // Column 2 'Date Submitted' =&gt; array('data'  =&gt; $row-&gt;subdate, 'class' =&gt; 'col-submitted',), // Column 3 'STATUS'  =&gt; array('data'  =&gt; $row-&gt;status, 'class' =&gt; 'col-status',),   // Row attributes   'id'    =&gt; 'articles-row-' . $row-&gt;nid, 'class' =&gt; 'articles-row'); }  // Format and print out the table. return theme('table', $table_header, $table_rows, array('id'      =&gt;     'table-articles', 'class'   =&gt; 'articles' )); </code></pre>
