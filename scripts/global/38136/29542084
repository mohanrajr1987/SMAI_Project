<p>I know, we are still on Drupal 6</p>  <p>I am wondering if there is an easy Module I can use to "Mobilize" our site?</p>  <p>I tried Modernizr, but it isn't happy.</p>  <p>We need to keep our current theme the way it is for desktop viewing, we just need to update tablet and phone viewing theme.</p>  <p>Has anyone had any luck using a module for Drupal 6 ?</p>  <p>Thanks so much!</p>
