<p>I upgraded a Drupal 6 site to Drupal 7. Everything works fine except uploaded files (in the <em>files</em> folder).</p>  <p>Domain for the D6 site is abc.com and domain for the D7 site is xyz.com.</p>  <p>After migration, I find all files links become xyz.com/sites/xyz.com/files/<strong>sites/abc.com</strong>/FILENAME</p>  <p>The correct link shall be <strong><em>xyz.com/sites/xyz.com/files/FILENAME</em></strong></p>  <p>File system settings in the Drupal 7 site are correctly set.</p>  <p>Any idea why I got wrong links?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
