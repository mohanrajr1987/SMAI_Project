<p>So i want to have primary link menu on right top side of my website. I have set it and its working as expected in desktop pc and laptop browsers, even in android phones also. But in ios devices (iPhone, iPad) menu not expanding to show the child menus.</p>  <p>For example:</p>  <p>-P1 --C1(child-1) --C2(child-2)</p>  <p>-P2 --C3(child-3) --c4(child-4)</p>  <p>If i click on P1,P2 nothing happens, not showing child menu.</p>  <p>I have enabled expanded to P1 and P2. So in all devices other than ios devices its working fine.</p>  <p>Though if i set a node to P1 and P2 it start showing child on ios device also. But then on other devices it not allow me to select child menu. Before i can select the child menu page gets redirected and i don't want that to happen.</p>  <p>Any suggestions, how can i solve this issue?</p>  <p>Edit: Menu work fine in ios device opera mini browser, not in safari or google crome.</p>  <p>Thanks,</p>  <p>Jay Stepin.</p>
