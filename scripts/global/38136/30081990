<p>I have one Drupal 6 install running several sites or themes. For example:     www.example.com/site1     www.example.com/site2     www.example.com/site3</p>  <p>There was not a site at www.example.com except for a landing page acting as a place holder.</p>  <p>Google Analytics was setup with www.example.com as the Property and each site as a separate View. Reporting was fine for sites 1, 2, 3 and we did not care about the base site because nothing was there.</p>  <p>Now, we just launched the base site, www.example.com, but Google Analytic includes stats for sites 1, 2, 3 in its reporting.</p>  <p>In the view for www.example.com we set up custom filters to exclude the other sites. It's a custom filter to exclude the Request URI with the pattern of site1. A second filter for site2 and a third for site3. However the filters are not working.</p>  <p>Does anyone have a recommendation for setting up Google Analytics so I can get reporting on just the base site?</p>
