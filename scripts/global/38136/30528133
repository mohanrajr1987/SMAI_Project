<p>I have struggled to make Apache recognize Php 5.3.29 (I need it to run a very old Drupal 6 website). </p>  <p>I am using a Google Cloud Platform VM running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.</p>  <p>I successfully installed PHP 5.3.29 by compiling it and now running </p>  <pre><code># php -v   </code></pre>  <p>shows The correct version PHP 5.3.29. However after installing Apache I couldn't get it to recognize that version of PHP, it couldn't even compile PHP.</p>  <p>So I read somewhere that I need to run</p>  <pre><code>sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-php5 </code></pre>  <p>But when i do that and run an info.php file with</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php phpinfo() ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I get PHP Version 5.5.12-2ubuntu4.4</p>  <p>My question is: How can I make it so Apache will point/recognize The older PHP version 5.3.29 ?</p>
