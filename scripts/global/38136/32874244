<p>I just retrieve maintenance (archive FTP/SQL) of a website running<strong> Drupal 6.22</strong></p>  <p>But, I have an Debian 8 server with Apache 2.4, PHP 5.6 and MySQL 5.5. :)</p>  <p><strong>==> So my question is : what is the upper version of these software (Apache, PHP, MySQL) can run Drupal 6.22 ?</strong> I think PHP 5.3, but after ?  (I know that 6.22 is an old version but I will update after first run).</p>  <p>Really thanks for your help.</p>
