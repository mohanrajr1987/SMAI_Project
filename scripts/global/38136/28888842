<p>I had a Drupal 6.30 installation on Acquia which I upgraded to Drupal 6.34 using Acquia's Drupal Commons 2.22 found here <a href="https://www.acquia.com/downloads" rel="nofollow">https://www.acquia.com/downloads</a>. I followed the Drupal steps to upgrade the core and executed the uptade.php. After the upgrade the site doesn't seem to recognize the commons modules, such as ctools, views, token, og, context, etc, in the modules list they appear as missing. There are no errors in the Log Entries. Is there any other configuration to enable this modules?</p>
