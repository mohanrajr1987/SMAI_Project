<p>I have a drupal site built by a freelancer, there are few things which were confusing.</p>  <ol> <li><p>When I click the edit button for a node, I see the CkEditor - I tried adding HTML tags and some css to tags. Then I saved it. I found few more changes have to be done, so I clicked the edit button on the respective node and I found the tags/css I added were missing.</p></li> <li><p>Similarly I clicked the edit button for some other node and I did not do anything, I just clicked the save button. The output was completed distorted(because few css was missing and some tags were missing too).</p></li> </ol>  <p>P.S - Am very new to Drupal and this might be a basic question. Please bear with me. </p>
