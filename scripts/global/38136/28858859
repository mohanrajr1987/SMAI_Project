The only way to get them to display is to use the "Next" buttons and go through each pane. And while I know this (now), the user probably didn't.</li> </ul>  <p>How would I make it so if they enter incorrect credit card information, that pane is displayed and the others are collapsed and the buttons to Review Order and Cancel are shown? </p>
