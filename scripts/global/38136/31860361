<p>first time posting! I'll try to be as clear as possible.</p>  <p>I have a Drupal 6 website and am using a custom template file to render some pages differently than the rest of the website.</p>  <p>This is what the code I'm working with looks like:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php print $header; ?&gt;  &lt;?php if ($title): ?&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;?php print $title; ?&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;?php endif; ?&gt; &lt;?php print $content ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>The page renders correctly when the URL looks like this: <a href="http://example.com/somepage/?format=kiosk" rel="nofollow">http://example.com/somepage/?format=kiosk</a></p>  <p>Except any link that is rendered in the page will go to: <a href="http://example.com/otherpage/" rel="nofollow">http://example.com/otherpage/</a></p>  <p>What I need dynamically appended to the end of any URL is:</p>  <pre><code>?format=kiosk </code></pre>  <p>Is there a to process these links using PHP or JavaScript, without resorting to .htaccess (though that's an option), to add that bit to the URL?</p>  <p>I suppose this could also be handy for other things, like Google Analytics.</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>  <p>Jon</p>
