<p>Okay, I'm pretty new when it comes to C++ (having moved over from VB) and I can't seem to work out how to populate an array without doing:</p>  <pre><code>array[0] = 1 array[1] = 2  </code></pre>  <p>etc etc</p>  <p>So as could be expected, I have tried this:</p>  <pre><code>float posVector[3]; //Declared outside of int main() as needs to be global posVector = {0.0f,0.0f,0.0f}; //Inside int main() </code></pre>  <p>Which is causing this error to be displayed:</p>  <pre><code>extended initializer lists only available with -std=c++0x or -std=gnu++0x [enabled by default] </code></pre>  <p>Nothing I have been able to locate online so far has been of any help. So any advice you can give me on fixing this will be appreciated!</p>
