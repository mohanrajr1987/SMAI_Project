<p>I want to experiment with migrating my a project from gcc to clang++. I admit ignorance on my part, I'm not sure why the following bit of code</p>  <pre><code>template &lt;typename T&gt; constexpr T pi{std::acos(T(-1.0))}; </code></pre>  <p>compiles silently with g++ but in clang++ produces the error</p>  <pre><code>trig.hpp:3:13: error: constexpr variable 'pi&lt;float&gt;' must be initialized by a constant expression constexpr T pi{std::acos(T(-1.0))}; </code></pre>  <p>and I was hoping someone who knows more about it than I do could enlighten me.</p>  <p>NB: Tried with -std=C++14 and C++1y. Fails under clang version 3.6.2 (tags/RELEASE_362/final). Works with g++ (GCC) 5.2.0.</p>
