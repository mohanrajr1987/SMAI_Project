<p>Hey guys i'm trying to compile a script using the cx_freeze module my script contains the following modules:</p>  <pre><code>import os import smtplib from email import encoders from email.mime.base import MIMEBase from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart from email.mime.application import MIMEApplication import time from time import sleep import pyHook, pythoncom, sys, logging </code></pre>  <p>But when i try to buld the exe i get this error in the cmd:</p>  <pre><code>Missing modules: ? _cpyHook imported from pyHook.cpyHook ? _dummy_threading imported from dummt_threading ? ce imported from os ? doctest imported from heapq ? getopt imported from base64,quopri ? org.python.core imported from copy ? os.path imported from os, pyHook  ? poxis imported from os, pyHook.cpyHook ? pwd imported from posixpath ? subprocess imported from os </code></pre>  <p>As expected the exe doesn't work it only flashes so fast i can't even read the error, i have read a lot of related questions and the cx_freeze documentation and i still haven't found the answer. </p>  <p>The script its working perfectly in the python environment so i think the problem are the missing modules. This is the setup script im using:</p>  <pre><code>import sys from cx_Freeze import setup, Executable  build_exe_options = {"include_msvcr": True}   #skip error msvcr100.dll missing  includes = ["sys","pyHook", "pythoncom","logging","os","smtplib","email","time"] #modules and libraries include_msvcr = ['networkChanger.exe.manifest']  program = Executable(  # what to build     script = "newscript.py", #main script     initScript = None,     compress = True,     copyDependentFiles = True,     appendScriptToExe = True,     appendScriptToLibrary = True)   setup(version = "1.1",     description = "How fast can you tipe ? ",     author = "Me",     name = "Program1",     options = {"build_exe": {"includes": includes}},executables=[program]) </code></pre>  <p>Hope you can help me and another last thing in the documentation it's said that there's the option </p>  <pre><code>silent (-s)     suppress all output except warnings </code></pre>  <p>where should this option has to be written and, it shows no windows when the exe if executed or it just closes the comand promp while compiling?</p>
