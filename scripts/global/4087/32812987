<p>I'm trying to call a function in main for the different programs (Q2-3 and Q4) but I'm getting an error during compiling. in my main I have prog1 ();  [it says "previous implicit declaration of prog1 was here"] then there is a function of the same name at the very end void prog1() { [it says "conflicting types for prog1"] and yes it just says it on a line where the only thing is { </p>  <p>the [] are just what I typed here not what is in my code. If you need more parts of my code let me know. My program is written in C not C++</p>
