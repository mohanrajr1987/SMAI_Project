<p>When I execute the code</p>  <pre><code>let (a,p) = (2+2, Printf.printf) in p "abc"; p "%d" 3 ;; </code></pre>  <p>I expect to see the output <code>abc3</code>, but get instead</p>  <pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>File "f.ml", line 1, characters 46-47: Error: This function has type (unit, out_channel, unit) format -&gt; unit        It is applied to too many arguments; maybe you forgot a `;'. </code></pre>  <p>The fun part is that if I change <code>2+2</code> to <code>2</code>, it runs.</p>  <p>Why does the code produce an error as is, but not with <code>+2</code> removed?</p>
