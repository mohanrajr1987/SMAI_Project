<p>I've created a class named ListaProductos with it's constructor working fine. But when I try to instance an ListaProductos object in the projects main it seems it doesn't do it right. Then when I run the project I get this error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Exception in thread "main" java.lang.RuntimeException: Uncompilable   source code - Erroneous tree type: subsistemaproyeccion.ListaProductos     at   subsistemaproyeccion.SubsistemaProyeccion.main(SubsistemaProyeccion.java:39)   Java Result: 1</p> </blockquote>  <p>I've already had a look at the "Compile at Save" option, but when I deselect it it compiles with even more errors than before.</p>  <p>I would really appreciate someone's help. I'm a student and very new at Java programming.</p>
