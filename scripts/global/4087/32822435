<p>I have a sample project with multiple schemes.I am new to such a project.</p>  <p>I want to know <strong>How When</strong> and <strong>Where</strong> do we use such a flow(multiple projects in a single project).</p>  <p>See the image below,<strong><em>I am getting a file missing error</em></strong> while I try to build the project.But I don't know why I am getting such an error.The file that says is missing is already there in the project folder.</p>  <p>What am i doing wrong?I have added the three schemes by directly clicking <strong>+addfiles</strong> button to "my project " button at the bottom of the navigation pane.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/clwzM.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/clwzM.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p><strong><em>the error is : "HTTPConnection.h file is missing."</em></strong></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/K6hT7.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/K6hT7.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
