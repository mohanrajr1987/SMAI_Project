<p>If <code>String.Empty</code> is as good as <code>""</code>, then how come the compiler throws up with string.Empty in the <code>case</code> statement? Nothing can be more constant than <code>string.Empty</code> in my view. Anyone know?  Thanks! </p>  <pre><code>switch (filter)             {      case string.Empty:  // Compiler error "A constant value is expected"                  break;                  case "":  // It's Okay.                     break;              } </code></pre>
