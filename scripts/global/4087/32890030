<p>I am editing a report that was built by someone else and I am using iReport to do so. I am very new to SQL and iReport. All I've been asked to do is take the current report and add a text box and text field that display the title "Email" and below it have the text field hold and display the variable "shiptoemail".</p>  <p>I do all of this easy enough; my issue is that whenever I hit build it compiles just fine (It doesnt exactly run though) but when ever I upload the report to FishBowl it's as if i never edited a single thing. Yet when i reopen the report i just posted back into iReport- my changes are there.</p>  <p>If you guys have any idea what im doing wrong please help.</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
