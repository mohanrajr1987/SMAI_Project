<p>I have not been studying iOS or Swift for very long. With one of the latest Xcode updates, many of the apps I have made on my computer now appear to be using obsolete syntax.</p>  <p>Xcode talks us through converting it to new syntax but often that does not solve anything and I have a new problem. Here is code for one of the first app I made after the syntax has been converted. I am getting an error saying:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Value of optional type 'String?' not unwrapped; did you mean to use   '!' or '?' ?</p> </blockquote>  <p>I know this must be really simple but I don't know how to fix it. Here is my code:</p>  <pre><code>@IBAction func findAge(sender: AnyObject) {     var enteredAge = Int(age.text)     if enteredAge != nil {         var catYears = enteredAge! * 7         resultLabel.text = "Your cat is \(catYears) in cat years"     } else {         resultLabel.text = "Please enter a whole number"     } }   </code></pre>
