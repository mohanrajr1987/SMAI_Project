<p>I have installed the latest version of g++. I downloaded an rpm from <a href="http://www.rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=gcc-c%20%20" rel="nofollow">here</a> and I installed it on my Ubuntu machine (version is Precise 12.04 LTS) using the following commands</p>  <pre><code>rpm -i gcc-c++-5.2.1-0.20150811.6.mga6.x86_64.rpm sudo alien -i gcc-c++-5.2.1-0.20150811.6.mga6.x86_64.rpm </code></pre>  <p>I can see that the the new version of the compiler has been installed in </p>  <pre><code>/usr/bin/g++-5.2.1 </code></pre>  <p>but when I try to compile a file I receive the following error</p>  <pre><code>/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-mageia-linux-gnu/5.2.1/cc1plus:  error while loading shared libraries: libisl.so.13:  cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory </code></pre>  <p>Do I have to install further rpm or further files? I've searched on my pc and I really don't have that shared library.</p>
