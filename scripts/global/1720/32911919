<p>I'm experimenting with 2 pairs of stereo cameras (4 pairs), and I'm wondering how to combine the 3d point clouds I get from the 2 pairs of cameras. Basically, I'm successfully getting 2 sets of 3d points from the 2 different pairs of cameras. But, I'm not sure which coordinate frame (the world coordinates) the 3d points are in relative to. </p>  <p>Is it relative to the left camera (the 1st set of image points when calibrating)?</p>  <p>My idea is, if I get the rotation and transform between the two left cameras (let's say it's L_1 and L_2, where L_1 is the left camera for this pair), and then try to transform the 3d points from the R_2 and L_2 pair to the new frame, it would work? But, I'm not sure.</p>
