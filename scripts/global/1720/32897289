<p>I'm trying to display an image using OpenCV. I have tried different images, but just get the title bar of the figure displayed, and seems that it considers my images empty.</p>  <p>I have used this command to read the image:</p>  <pre><code>Mat im = imread("1.1.01.tiff"); </code></pre>  <p>And this command to display the image:</p>  <pre><code>imshow("Hello", im); </code></pre>  <p>Why are my images considered empty and not displayed?</p>
