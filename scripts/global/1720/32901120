But it's not accurate.</p>  <p>I extracted this red ball based on HSV Color Space, but it always ignores the contour of this ball. (Perhaps because color of contour is much darker).</p>  <p>Any good ideas to let me fit a better ellipse for this ball? I want to find an ellipse which can embrace the red ball as accurate as possible.</p>  <p>It will be better if I can use existing functions of OpenCV.</p>
