<p>I have been writing a code in which i have to take 2 frames per iteration for absdiff(); <code>cp&gt;&gt;frame1; cp&gt;&gt;frame2; absdiff(frame1,frame2,out)</code> frame1 was getting 0,2,4,6,8,10,.... frame2 was getting 1,3,5,7,9,11,.... I am not getting all the combinations of frame1,frame2. LET'S CALL THIS PROCESS-1</p>  <p>But,I needed frame1 as 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,..... and frame2 as 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,...... So,I used </p>  <pre><code> cp.set(CV_CAP_PROPS_POS_FRAMES,cp.get(CV_CAP_PROPS_POS_FRAMES)-1); </code></pre>  <p>to set the next frame number to that of frame2 instead of frame2+1.Now ,I am getting my desired output. I am getting all the combinations of frame1,frame2. LET'S CALL THIS PROCESS-2 But, processing speed PROCESS-2 is nearly 1/5 to that of the  PROCESS-1 So,I am guessing setting the VideoCapture property i.e next frame position is responsible for decreasing the speed.Am I wrong?If not, Is there any other way to get my desired output.</p>
