<p>Can somebody tell me what this deep learning technique is? How to use these deep learning techniques in opencv? Is it available in the form of a library? Can I use this deep learning to learn about the LRT of the given image in opencv i.e. given a set of images, I have the Local Rank Transform (LRT) of each of them, then given totally new LRT matrix can I find the image matrix.</p>
