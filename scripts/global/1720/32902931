<p>Helllo, is there a way to save the flann index, that was build in java ? I'm used the OpenCV Library 2.4.11</p>  <p>I know, that I can read and write the config file that is used for the flann matcher as xml or yml.</p>  <p>My current parameter file is:</p>  <pre><code>%YAML:1.0 indexParams:  -   name: algorithm   type: 23   value: 1 -   name: trees   type: 4   value: 4 searchParams: -   name: checks   type: 4   value: 32 -   name: eps   type: 5   value: 4. -   name: sorted   type: 15   value: 1 </code></pre>  <p>I read that I must switch the parameter ``type` of algorithm to 254 (Saved index?) in value, I set the name of the new index file .But it was ignored, I thought. </p>  <p>Anybody know, how to save the index?</p>  <p>Best regards</p>
