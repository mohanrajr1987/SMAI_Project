<p>I know this question has already been asked but I still can not make it work with the existing answers. I installed OpenCV on my macbook following this procedure : <a href="https://jjyap.wordpress.com/2014/05/24/installing-opencv-2-4-9-on-mac-osx-with-python-support/" rel="nofollow">https://jjyap.wordpress.com/2014/05/24/installing-opencv-2-4-9-on-mac-osx-with-python-support/</a></p>  <p>But when I try to import <code>cv2</code> in Python I get the error message.</p>  <p>When I try to do 'pip install cv2', I get 'Requirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): cv2 in ./anaconda/lib/python3.4/site-packages' like if cv2 was well installed.</p>  <p>What did I miss?</p>  <p>EDIT : I looked at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27606916/no-module-named-cv2">No module named cv2</a></p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29115126/importerror-no-module-named-cv2">ImportError: No module named cv2</a></p>  <p>I think the pip is associated with the python installation because I tried to install pandas the same way and it works perfectly. </p>  <p>The cv2 was installed to the same directory as pandas so I also guess it is on my PYTHONPATH but I may be mistaken. When I print sys.path there is './anaconda/lib/python3.4/site-packages' where cv2 is supposed to be installed. </p>
