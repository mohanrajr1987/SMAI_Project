<p>I have a file which I have written in "Regular C style".  for example</p>  <pre><code>void foo() {     if(;;) {         ....     } else {         ...     } } </code></pre>  <p>wanted to change this style to GNU style coding using vim or some other plugin </p>  <pre><code>void foo() {     if(;;)       {         ....       }     else       {         ....       } } </code></pre>  <p>Wanted to ask if there can be a quick shortcut to do it so that it detects the loops starting braces and brings it below and indents it by 2 spaces.</p>  <p>Any help is greatly appreciated !</p>
