<p>I'm trying to estimate a depth map of a 2D video to convert it to 3D. One of the depth cues that would help me do so is interposition (occlusion).</p>  <p>I have already detected the occluded regions in a video stream using optical flow. I actually implemented this paper: <em>Ayvaci, A., Raptis, M., &amp; Soatto, S. (2012). Sparse occlusion detection with optical flow. International Journal of Computer Vision, 97(3), 322-338.</em></p>  <p>Here are couple of screenshots of the results:</p>  <ul> <li>Estimated motion: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/f8utjgfhuxbf008/motionestimation.png?dl=0" rel="nofollow">https://www.dropbox.com/s/f8utjgfhuxbf008/motionestimation.png?dl=0</a></li> <li>occluded region: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/qig601n0kb3mi2v/occluded_regions.png?dl=0" rel="nofollow">https://www.dropbox.com/s/qig601n0kb3mi2v/occluded_regions.png?dl=0</a></li> </ul>  <p>Now that I have occluded regions, I need to assign depth such that an object that occlude another is closer and occluded region is further. </p>  <p>Any help on how to do so in Matlab is appreciated!</p>
