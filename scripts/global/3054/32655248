<p>I was looking at the <a href="http://codeguide.co" rel="nofollow">Code Guide by @mdo</a> and saw that Mark Otto (creator of Bootstrap) recommends soft tabs set to two spaces because "they're the only way to guarantee code renders the same in any environment" and "to avoid common code inconsistencies and dirty diffs". </p>  <p>I'm not going to pretend to know more about web development that Mark Otto, but I've always been of the opinion that tabs for hierarchical indentation and then spaces for alignment is the way to go. How would this cause rendering issues, inconsistencies, and/or dirty diffs? Could these issues be attributed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_error" rel="nofollow">PEBCAK</a>s or code editors? What other issues could either approach cause?</p>
