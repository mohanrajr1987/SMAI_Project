<p>The question is basically about good code-style.</p>  <p>Currently working on a big project that has a lot of <code>current_user</code>, <code>current_style</code> etc. methods that can be called both from controller and view. Now I'm defining this methods in <code>ApplicationController</code>, but I think that controllers are made for 'action' methods. Like 'index', 'edit' etc. and not for defining such additional methods. What is the best place to keep such methods? I'm thinking about helpers, but they are made to unload views from code and not for such stuff. Concerns? ApplicationController? Helpers?</p>
