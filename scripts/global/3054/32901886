<p>Why is "Easier to Ask Forgiveness than it is to get Permission" (<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/glossary.html#term-eafp" rel="nofollow">EAFP</a>) considered good practice in Python? As a programming novice I have the impression that using many <code>try...except</code> routines will rather lead to bloated and less readable code than compared to using other checks. </p>  <p>What is the advantage of the EAFP approach?</p>  <p>NB: I know there are similar questions here, but they mostly refer to some specific example, while I am more interested in the philosophy behind the principle.</p>
