<p>What is the "best practices" approach to this Rails problem?  </p>  <p>Registration controller &amp; model "registers" new users<br> Sessions controller &amp; model "logs in" users<br> Both access a 3rd party API for the actual User model / registration / login  </p>  <p>If a new user meets certain criteria, after they are registered, we want to automatically log them in.  </p>  <pre><code>@registration = Registrations.new(registrations_params)   if @registration.create     # log in the user   end   </code></pre>  <p>Is it good practice to log in the user by calling the session object from the registrations controller?<br> <code>@session.create</code><br> If not, what is the acceptable standard for accomplishing sessions creation upon new user registration?  </p>
