<p>This question is in regards to proper and acceptable coding practice given the following scenario.</p>  <p>I have the following 2 Methods. </p>  <pre><code>public TService GetDuplexClientChannel&lt;T&gt;(BindingType bindingType, EndpointAddress endPointAddress) where T : TService {       .. Do work .. then ..       return InstanceOf(TService); }  public TService GetDuplexClientChannel&lt;T&gt;(BindingType bindingType, string endPointAddress) where T : TService { // Call the above method and just return it. return GetDuplexClientChannel&lt;T&gt;(bindingType, new EndpointAddress(endPointAddress); </code></pre>  <p>}</p>  <p>In the first example I have Method A that does the work, and Method B which simply is an overload of A, but calls A to do the work. </p>  <p>I would like to know if this is an acceptable pattern , or should the code be repeated in the second method? What is the best practice for this.</p>  <p>I have looked at this link but it does not answer my question as to what is proper or not proper: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15058314/better-way-to-overload-methods-in-c-sharp">Better way to overload methods in C#</a></p>
