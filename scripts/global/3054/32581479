<p>I have a small php coding query.</p>  <p>I have a index.php page referring to another page called template.php in that it contains following line:</p>  <pre><code>?php=$this-&gt;title? </code></pre>  <p>I guess something is not correct with this line as my Webpage, instead of loading the Name of the page, shows the above code itself.</p>  <p>This works on older Server. But post migration to newer server having php version 5.2 , some weird errors have popped up.</p>  <p>I am new to PHP so please ask if you require more Information.</p>  <p>Investigating further I noticed following,</p>  <p>at the beginning of the code there is reference to ,</p>  <p>[code] " lang=""> [/code]</p>  <p>In working page it shows the corresponding source code as,</p>  <p>[code] [/code]</p>  <p>And problem page , it shows,</p>  <p>[code]" lang="">[/code]</p>  <p>I think this is the core problem as the lang variable is not getting loaded somehow and thats why further references to translate also fails. My thought.</p>
