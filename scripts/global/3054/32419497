<p>Is there any advantage in organizing objects, variables and functions inside objects in (specifically) Javascript?</p>  <p>E.g., suppose you are coding a game and you have the following functions <code>loadImages(), loadMusic(), loadBackgrounds(), checkIfEnemiesAreDead(), populateEnemiesArray(), checkIfPlayerIsDead(), givePlayerUpgrade().</code></p>  <p>What are the advantages of creating objects, say, a <code>loader</code> object, an <code>enemy</code> object and a <code>player</code> object to hold all these methods, compared to simply vertically grouping them together? I see some programmers creating objects to store them, and others just grouping them close to each other based on what it does. Does it make the code that much cleaner? Also, what kind of problems can not storing (or storing) them in objects could possibly cause?</p>
