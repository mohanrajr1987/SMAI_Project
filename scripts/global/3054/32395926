<p>Is it ok to use a module referencing with more than two dots in a path? Like in this example:</p>  <pre><code># Project structure: # sound #     __init__.py #     codecs #         __init__.py #     echo #         __init__.py #         nix #             __init__.py #             way1.py #             way2.py  # way2.py source code from .way1 import echo_way1 from ...codecs import cool_codec  # Do something with echo_way1 and cool_codec. </code></pre>  <p><strong>UPD:</strong> Changed the example. And I know, this will work in a practice. But is it a common method of importing or not?</p>
