<p>So pretend I'm developing a car class and I want one of the car class's functions to return a list of passengers, except I'd like to put a list reference as an argument and just set that list instead of returning a list.</p>  <pre><code>void GetPassengerList(PassengerList &amp;passengerList); //sets the list </code></pre>  <p>I don't know if I should call it GetPassengerList or SetPassengerList, or something else. I feel like using the words get / set make it seem like there is a private variable that is being manipulated like the typical getter / setter methods. What's a good naming convention to use here?</p>
