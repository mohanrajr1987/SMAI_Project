<p>I'm fairly new to working with C# and ASP.NET and I'm curious if there is a convention to naming the SqlCommands when more than one query is being run on a SQL database.  For example, I have created my SqlConnection and I wish to call a function, two stored procedures, and just create a regular simple query.  Currently, I am using:</p>  <pre><code>SqlCommand function = new SqlCommand(); SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand(); SqlCommand proc1 = new SqlCommand(); SqlCommand proc2 = new SqlCommand(); </code></pre>  <p>Is there a more accepted naming convention for these different commands or  should I just use a single command as I am using the CommandText and CommandType calls in the later code blocks?</p>
