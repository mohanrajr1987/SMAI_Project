<p>I'm writing an application, and I want to make sure I have a good coding standard when it comes to constants and literals. The thing is, I'm not completely sure where I should use constants, and where using constants is just going overboard! For example...</p>  <pre><code>public class MyWindow : Window {     public const string WindowTitle = "This seems like overkill!";      public MyWindow() : base()     {         this.Title = WindowTitle;     } } </code></pre>  <p>So my question is, what are the most widely-accepted criteria for deciding on what should be declared as a constant, and what shouldn't? I'm guessing that anything that's used in one place only should be a literal (such as a title of a window), and anything used several times should be a constant?</p>
