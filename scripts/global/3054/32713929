<p>I have a question about mapping Long value to another Long value and the best way to achieve that.</p>  <p>I have to map left values to right values just right before writing data to database.</p>  <ul> <li>3 => 70 </li> <li>8 => 12</li> <li>1 => 45</li> </ul>  <p>Is there any "best way"? I was thinking about static map where the left Long will be a key and a right would be a value, and I have just to get a value corresponding to a given key.</p>  <p>Is it good approach?</p>
