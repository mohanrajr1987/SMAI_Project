<p>So, reStructuredText is <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0287" rel="nofollow">the recommended way</a> for Python code documentation, if you try hard enough, you can <a href="http://sphinx-doc.org/domains.html#python-signatures" rel="nofollow">find in the sphinx documentation</a> how to normalize your function signature documentation. All given examples are single-line, but what if a parameter description is multi-line like the following ?</p>  <pre><code>def f(a, b):     """ Does something with a and b      :param a: something simple     :param b: well, it's not something simple, so it may require more than eighty               chars     """ </code></pre>  <p>What is the syntax/convention for that ? Should I indent or not ? will it break reSTructuredText rendering ?</p>
