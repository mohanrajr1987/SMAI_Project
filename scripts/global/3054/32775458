<p>I have worked with servlets and JSPs for a while now, but I am looking to improve the way I write my J2EE code. I want to learn stuff like when to use properties file, how can I hide the database details from the user if I use JSP? Best way to create cookies? how to handle session management? etc etc., keen on know industry standard coding style. Can someone please share links for the tutorials? Thank you in advance.</p>  <p>Something like <a href="https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/java/Java+Coding+Guidelines" rel="nofollow">https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/java/Java+Coding+Guidelines</a> would be really helpful.</p>
