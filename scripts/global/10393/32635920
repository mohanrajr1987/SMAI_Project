<p>I've looked around for about 3-4 hours now and I've even tried every solution I could find on StackOverflow but none of them worked.</p>  <p>I'm trying to set the the cursor to a custom cursor(.cur) file when the cursor is in my window.</p>  <p>Here's the code I'm using:</p>  <pre><code>HWND hwnd = FindWindow(NULL, SDL_GetWindowTitle(m_hwnd-&gt;GetWindowPtr())); //This finds the window title and gets the handle of the window matching the title  if (hwnd == NULL) {     myOuputDebugMessage("Could not get handle to window", false); } std::string completePath = CURSORS_PATH + path; //CURSORS_PATH is a define of a string that is the location of my cursors folder  m_ActiveCursor = LoadCursorFromFile(completePath.c_str()); //m_ActiveCursor is a HCURSOR data type SetCursor(m_ActiveCursor); SetClassLongPtr(hwnd, GCLP_HCURSOR, (LONG_PTR)m_ActiveCursor); //I've tried this with the third argument set to NULL and it makes no difference </code></pre>  <p>This code runs every frame but the cursor image flickers between the system image and my image when I move the mouse.</p>  <p>How can I fix this?</p>
