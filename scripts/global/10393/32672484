<p>I fill a RecyclerView with a custom cursor adapter, which loads data from a database and works very well. Anyway, with user interaction, the database can become of some thousands of entries and the process of data load becomes very slow. I'm trying to get the RecyclerView to work in an endless mode, in order to display only a few entries until the user scrolls down, but I can't find any example on how to do that using a cursor. All the examples I've found are based on Lists, but I think it would be an heavier solution to implement it too.</p>
