<p>I have implemented custom cursor like :</p>    <pre><code>$("canvas").css({cursor : 'url(../image/image1/cursors/curso.cur), auto'}); </code></pre>  <p>This implementation is working with http (my jsp page is requested over http) as soon as i redirect my page from http to https it is not working and showing default cursor only. I am new to the thing. Can anyone please help me to solve this issue.?            </p>
