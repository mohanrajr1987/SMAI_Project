<p>I am currently trying to set my cursor in a certain region of the screen. </p>  <p>I am using the following method:</p>  <pre><code>this.Cursor = new Cursor(Cursor.Current.Handle); Cursor.Position = new Point(Cursor.Position.X - 50, Cursor.Position.Y - 50);  Cursor.Clip = new Rectangle(this.Location, this.Size); </code></pre>  <p>However nothing actually happens when this code is executed. Can anyone tell me what's going on?</p>
