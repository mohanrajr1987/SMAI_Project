<p>My Language is T-SQL and I am working with MS SQLServer 2008.</p>  <p>Well, I have a table with a lot of data with information concerning employees. Every employee has a "startdate" (the time when he startet to work for the company) and and "enddate" (the time when he quit the job).  I would like to write into a table the same count of rows as the employee worked for the company in month. For example:</p>  <p>My basic table:</p>  <hr>  <p>Employee Number | StartDate | EndDate 4711               20150101   20150523</p>  <hr>  <p>This example shows that the employee worked for the company for 5 Month. So I want to insert in the new table 5 rows with the following information:</p>  <p>New Table:</p>  <hr>  <pre><code>  Employee Number | StartDate | EndDate   row1: 4711               20150101   20150523    row2: 4711               20150201   20150523    row3: 4711               20150301   20150523    row4: 4711               20150401   20150523    row5: 4711               20150501   20150523 </code></pre>  <hr>  <p>I tried this to get the number of month between the dates. I guess I need to work with a cursor or something like that.</p>  <pre><code>    declare @start DATE = '2011-05-01' declare @end DATE = '2011-08-01'  ;with months (date) AS (     SELECT @start     UNION ALL     SELECT DATEADD(month,1,date)     from months     where DATEADD(month,1,date)&lt;=@end ) select Datename(month,date) from months </code></pre>  <p>Hope you got the idea, I tried to be as specific as I can.</p>
