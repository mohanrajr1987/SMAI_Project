<p>In my project I use custom cursors, but those only show up for maybe a second and go back to the normal cursor. The elements are not overlaid by anything (Made sure of that with "pointer-events: none;" on overlaying elements).</p>  <p>Here is the CSS I'm using to apply those custom cursors:</p>  <pre><code>.plant {     -webkit-cursor: url("../img/watering_can.png"), auto;     cursor: url("../img/watering_can.png"), auto; } </code></pre>  <p>or just:</p>  <pre><code>.pointer {     -webkit-cursor: pointer;     cursor: pointer; } </code></pre>  <p>The content is mostly generated dynamically from an object. The DOM looks something like this: <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/104966260/DOM.png" rel="nofollow">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/104966260/DOM.png</a></p>  <p>e.g. should the "kitchen sink" element have a pointer, because it has the class "pointer"</p>
