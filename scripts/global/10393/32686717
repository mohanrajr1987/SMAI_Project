<p>I have a listview backed by a cursor adapter.  However, when I go to make a change in the database on a background sync, the app crashes with the following: </p>  <pre><code>java.lang.IllegalStateException: couldn't move cursor to position 0         at android.support.v4.widget.CursorAdapter.getView(CursorAdapter.java:248)         at android.widget.HeaderViewListAdapter.getView(HeaderViewListAdapter.java:232)         at android.widget.AbsListView.obtainView(AbsListView.java:2842)         at android.widget.ListView.makeAndAddView(ListView.java:1884)         at android.widget.ListView.fillSpecific(ListView.java:1364)         at android.widget.ListView.layoutChildren(ListView.java:1671)         at android.widget.AbsListView.onLayout(AbsListView.java:2632) </code></pre>  <p>Furthermore, the data I am adding clears the database and inserts no data at all. I am confused as I thought the cursor was asynchronous to the database.</p>  <p>The crash occurs between the end of the sync and when I send a broadcast to notify the activity that the sync is finished. The broadcast receiver does not even receive the broadcast.</p>  <p>My question is how can I multithread this? That is, how can I clear and change the database, then update the cursor afterwards on activity after the sync is finished? </p>
