<p>Hi  I am using psycopg2 for postgres access.</p>  <p>I am trying to understand where "cursor" stores the returned rows. Does it store it in the database as a temporary table or is it on the clients end?</p>  <p>Does cursor (when you specify to fetch many rows) hit the database a query at a time or does it hit the database once ,get the first set of results then when you iterate over the returned values, it gets the next set (buffering).</p>  <p>I have read multiple articles on cursor but nothing really gives the inner working...</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
