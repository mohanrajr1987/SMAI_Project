<p>I'm Working with SQL Server and try to build a nested cursor. (I know cursors aren´t the best way to do things, but I can´t come up with any other solution).</p>  <p>So the first Cursor is going through a temporary Table ##Flanschbreite an catches FlanschMin into a variable. It works fine. But the inner cursor should do the same by catching FlanschMin into the variable @FL2. I want to create a temporary table which combines all possible combinations of these two variables. The outer cursor works fine, but the inner cursor isn´t going through the temporary table, it just returns the first entry. I think there is a problem with the @@FetchStatus.</p>  <p>Is there something obvious I´m doing wrong? (sorry for my bad English, I´m not a native speaker)</p>  <pre><code>    DECLARE curFL1 CURSOR FOR     SELECT FlanschMin FROM ##FlanschBreite;     OPEN curFL1       FETCH next FROM curFL1 INTO @FL1                                 WHILE @@Fetch_Status = 0      BEGIN          SELECT FlanschMin FROM ##FlanschBreite;         OPEN curFL2          FETCH next FROM curFL2 INTO @FL2                                     WHILE @@Fetch_Status = 0            BEGIN             SET @IDFLansch += 1                                                              INSERT INTO ##FlanschZuweisung (IDFZ, FL1, FL2) VALUES (@IDFlansch, @FL1, @FL2)             FETCH next FROM curFL2           END         CLOSE curFL2         DEALLOCATE curFL2      FETCH next FROM curFL1 INTO @FL1     END     CLOSE curFL1     DEALLOCATE curFL1 </code></pre>  <p>My result for ##Flanschzuweisung:</p>  <pre><code>IDFZ\ FL1\ FL2 1\     6\   6  2\     8\   6     3\    10\   6 4\     6\   6 5\     8\   6 ... </code></pre>  <p>What i need it to be:</p>  <pre><code>IDFZ\ FL1\ FL2 1\     6\   6 2\     8\   6 3\    10\   6 4\     6\   8 5\     8\   8     6\    10\   8 7\     6\  10 </code></pre>  <p>...</p>
