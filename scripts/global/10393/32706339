<p>I'm making a basic website for my engineering company and would like to include a full page cross-hair like cursor. Is there any way to include this in my site? Here's an example of this cursor: (I can't include the picture in the post because of lack of reputation.) <a href="http://imagebin.ca/v/2GSxt6zx57A5" rel="nofollow">http://imagebin.ca/v/2GSxt6zx57A5</a></p>  <p>I would like for this to follow around the page in place of a normal cursor. I can use javascript or CSS if its needed to make this. Thanks!</p>
