<p>I'm trying to make a small script that changes CSS of the body and the  cursor on the page to a cursor at a specified URL.</p>  <pre><code>var cursorurl=prompt('Enter url of a image you want to use as a cursor on this page'); document.body.style.cursor="url("+cursorurl+"), auto;"; </code></pre>  <p>The javascript appears to be valid, but the cursor doesn't change. I'm assuming it has something to do with <code>document.body.style.cursor="url("+cursorurl+"), auto;"</code> and the parentheses, but if it is then I'm not sure how to do it properly.</p>
