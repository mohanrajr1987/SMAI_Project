<p>Part of my program creates a new record for the table qgame_history.This table has an id and a result field. The latest record will have a result which is null. I want to use an implicit cursor to change this to a number like 1. the id has datatype NUMBER(5,0) and the result has datatype NUMBER(1,0). I used the following code which has no errors but there is no change. any reason why?</p>  <p>since the null will be in the last record, this will be in the record with the highest id, hence the max(history_id).</p>  <pre><code>set serveroutput on   DECLARE cnumber qgame_history.history_id%TYPE;  CURSOR c1    IS      SELECT history_id INTO cnumber      FROM qgame_history      WHERE history_id = (SELECT MAX(history_id)                         FROM                         qgame_history);  BEGIN        UPDATE qgame_history         SET result = 1         WHERE history_id = cnumber;        COMMIT; END; / </code></pre>  <p>I want to use this part of my project to demonstrate using implicit cursors. </p>
