<p>I have one question and I hope you can help me.<br> I want to create procedure within cursor for insert, select, update and delete. I create select syntax and what is do for me?<br> I define this for user to run select after this cursor to show their results :</p>  <pre><code>DECLARE TableCursor CURSOR GLOBAL FOR      SELECT TABLE_SCHEMA,TABLE_NAME      FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES  OPEN TableCursor DECLARE @Name NVARCHAR(50) DECLARE @Schema NVARCHAR(50) FETCH NEXT  FROM TableCursor  INTO @Schema,@Name  WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0  BEGIN          EXECUTE('                         CREATE PROC USP_SEL_'+@Schema+'_'+@Name+'                        AS                       BEGIN                                  SELECT *                      FROM '+@Schema+'.'+@Name+'                         END              ')       FETCH NEXT               FROM TableCursor             INTO @Schema,@Name  END  CLOSE TableCursor  DEALLOCATE TableCursor </code></pre>  <p>and user can write this code to run their result :</p>  <pre><code>EXEC [dbo].[USP_SEL_Production_Product] </code></pre>  <p>My question is what can I do for insert, update and delete for a user that they just write <code>EXEC</code> and see their results?</p>
