<p>I would like to print a list of 200 reference table names (refTableA, refTableB, etc) along with the option sets for each table (refTableAID, Description, Code, SortOrder). Some option sets are a single record; others may include over 30 records.  The script below inserts the Description, Code and SortOrder data into a temp table. I am stumped on how to insert the name of the table (refTableA) into the RefTableName field and the ID (RefTableAID) into the RefTableNameId field. Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>  <pre><code>IF OBJECT_ID('tempdb..#Temp') IS NOT NULL DROP TABLE #Temp DECLARE @table nvarchar(150)  DECLARE @sqlinsert nvarchar(max) DECLARE C1 CURSOR FOR SELECT TABLE_NAME FROM  Information_schema.tables where TABLE_NAME like 'ref%'  Create table #Temp ( RefTableName nvarchar(150), RefTableNameId int, Description nvarchar(100), Code nvarchar(50), SortOrder Decimal(5,2) )  OPEN C1 FETCH next FROM C1 INTO @table WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS =0 BEGIN   set @sqlinsert='Insert into #Temp (Description, Code, SortOrder)      Select Description,Code,SortOrder from *tbl*'          set @sqlinsert = REPLACE(@sqlinsert,'*tbl*',@table)   Print (@sqlinsert)   Exec (@sqlinsert)    FETCH next FROM C1 INTO @table END CLOSE C1 DEALLOCATE C1 SELECT * from #Temp </code></pre>
