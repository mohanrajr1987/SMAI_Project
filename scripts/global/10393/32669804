<p>I wanna make a shell on linux terminal using C, just like "bash", so I used fork() and execvp() to start any program gets written The thing is I wanna support the Up and Down arrows, meaning that when the user hits Up, the last written line is printed and so on, but when I use the usual printf I can't move the cursor around the printed text so I can't modify it, and it won't be taken as an input I tried using getch() and the '\b' option to move the cursor but it still doesn't permit me to modify the text nor will it read the whole line as an input any ideas?</p>
