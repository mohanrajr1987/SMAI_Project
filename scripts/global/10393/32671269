<p>For example, I have a bill. There are: a bill, list of products and a sum of dollars, that I have to pay. I have printed it via Console.WriteLine(), so but  I want to change something there, but I don't want to print it again on screen. I want to find the line where I want to change and rewrite the value. How can I do this, guys?  I tied something like that..</p>  <p>{</p>  <pre><code>int ID = 232342; Console.SetCursorPosition(1, 2); Console.Write(ID.ToString()); </code></pre>  <p>}</p>  <p>Cursor found the line, but when I try to rewrite the value, app closes.. I don't know how to do it. Somebody can help and explain? Thank you in advance, guys. </p>
