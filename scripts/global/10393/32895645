<p>I am working on a project and now I have been stuck on a weird stage.</p>  <p>I know that we can execute any query that has to do anything with database we can write that using:</p>  <pre><code>Cursor cursor = db.rawQuery("SELECT * FROM table_name", null); </code></pre>  <p>But now I want to execute this query:</p>  <pre><code>"SELECT strftime('%s','now','-2 day')" </code></pre>  <p>Generally the above query returns <strong>unixepoch time of one day before yesterday</strong>.</p>  <p>Does anyone know how can I get this done?</p>
