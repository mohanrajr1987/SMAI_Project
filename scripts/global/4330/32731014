<p><strong>UPDATE: IMPORTANT</strong> Ok, so I've been worried about the length of the file name for some time now, as I know windows, sometimes, has an issue with file names larger than 256 characters. These ones seem to be over that hitting 260 characters. So it's not the code rather a limitation.</p>  <hr>  <p>I've create a python script that among other thing is meant to copy, a number of files which have been skipped.  Now I've run into a snag where <strong>SOME</strong> files are not being copied.  Now these files are on our share and tend to have really long names. I am almost certain this plays a part as they are 260 characters in length. Does anyone have a way around this?</p>  <p><strong>Code:</strong> <strong>EDIT</strong> -- I've edited the code to try @realizedvariance suggestion</p>  <pre><code>if not file_path=="":     if not file_path.find("~$") &gt; 0:         folder_name, file_name = os.path.split(file_path)         if os.path.exists(folder_name):             for thefile in os.listdir(folder_name):                  if thefile.lower().rstrip().lstrip() == file_name.lower().rstrip().lstrip():                     print thefile                     print os.path.exists(folder_name)                     print os.path.exists(os.path.join(folder_name, thefile)) </code></pre>  <p>The files in which they are failing are files with the name like:</p>  <p>Here is the response of the print:</p>  <pre><code>Draft DR 129123 CP, Amendment No. 3 to AS NaZT 60335.2.11 2009 Household and similar electrical appliances - Safety â€“ Part 2.11  .msg True False DaltaPlaneR Business Information Newsletter - Issue 79, 2010 - Social Networking Apps in Business - Grail Roads Ltd.msg True False From DaltaPlaneR - Business Newsletter - Issue 78 - 2009 - Important Terms of Trade - Strategic Businesses Ltd.msg True False </code></pre>  <p>So it prints File Name, If the folder location is true, and then if the full location is true. Bear in mind it literally got the file names from <code>os.listdir(path)</code></p>
