<p>What would be the reverse command of something like(I'm ok if the code needs to be changed slightly to make it possible to detect where the file should be split).</p>  <pre><code>copy /b prog.exe + zip.zip out.exe </code></pre>  <p>I would like to get the zip back out from the original combination.</p>  <p>I would like the program to be in command prompt, powershell, node.js, or c if possible(python I guess could work).</p>  <p>My guess is that you might need a file size appended to the end like so <code>copy /b prog.exe + zip.zip + progsize out.exe</code>.</p>
