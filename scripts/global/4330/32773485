<p>I am very much a novice in VBA and am looking to do the following:</p>  <p>Copy Column A, B, C, D and E from one worksheet into a new worksheet until the first blank cell in Column A, then I want to loop this to repeat with the data after the blank cell into a new worksheet.</p>  <p>Example of the data would be:</p>  <pre><code>10595   30/06/2015 18:33    30/6/2015   122452  5  BLANK  12408   30/06/2015 21:19    30/6/2015   357733  110 </code></pre>  <p>and so forth... the other issue is that would result in approx 260 odd worksheets, so I might have to create a number of different workbooks?</p>
