<p>I have combine alias of two script. Following alias <strong>works fine</strong> in my OS setup</p>  <pre><code>alias build_command 'directory_1/foo.sh build' alias copy_command 'directory_2/bar.sh' alias build_copy 'build_command &amp;&amp; copy_command' alias bc build_copy </code></pre>  <p>The problem is when I want to dump the terminal output in a file. Can any one please tell me how I can do this ? FYI, I tried <code>bc &gt; temp.txt</code> in terminal, but does not work and I am not allow to modify the build and copy script:(</p>  <p>Thanks in advance :)</p>
