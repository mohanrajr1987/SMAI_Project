<p><strong><em>I opened this issue under a new question</em></strong></p>  <p>I decided to focus on a solution that uses PDO verses mysqli go to...</p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32798214/insert-row-from-another-table-using-php-pdo">INSERT row from another table using php PDO</a></p>  <p>Thanks guys for your time trying to help me solve this issue</p>  <p><strong><em>-----------</em></strong></p>  <p>I have two identical tables. I perform a search in the first table and echo results with a submit link for each row that appears in the results. See the following code...</p>  <pre><code>echo "&lt;div&gt;".$results['Description']." - &lt;a href='submit-ads-florida.php?Barcode=".$results['Barcode']."'&gt;SUBMIT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"; </code></pre>  <p>The script for "submit-ads-florida.php" is as follows...</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php include '../connect.php';  $query = "INSERT INTO adstable (Brand, Description, Price, Size, Price, Barcode)            SELECT Brand, Description, Price, Size, Price, Barcode FROM invtable            WHERE Barcode='".$mysqli-&gt;real_escape_string($_REQUEST['Barcode'])."";  $mysqli-&gt;query($query); ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I get the following error and I'm not sure what it means. </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Connected successfully.<br>   Fatal error: Call to a member function real_escape_string() on a non-object in /home/myaccount/public_html/florida-ave/submit-ads-florida.php on line 7</p> </blockquote>  <p>I'm still learning and I'm using a script from an example I found, so I may not be using the correct syntax for my solution. Any help is appreciated. </p>  <p><strong><em>UPDATE</em></strong></p>  <p>I've since made suggested changes. My connection script is...</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php $servername = "localhost"; $username = "name"; $password = "pass"; $db = "database";  // Create connection $conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $db);  // Check connection if ($conn-&gt;connect_error) { die("Connection failed: " . $conn-&gt;connect_error); }  echo "Connected successfully. "; ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>My submit-ads-florida.php script is...</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php include '../connect.php';  $query = "INSERT INTO adstable (Brand, Description, Price, Size, Price, Barcode)            SELECT Brand, Description, Price, Size, Price, Barcode FROM invtable            WHERE Barcode='.$conn-&gt;real_escape_string($_REQUEST['Barcode']).'";  $conn-&gt;query($query); ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p><strong><em>PROBLEM</em></strong> I no longer get the error, however, no data is being passed to the adstable from invtable. Any thoughts?</p>
