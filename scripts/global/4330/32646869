<p>I have n-ry tree with node like this:</p>  <pre><code>class Node {   public Node Parent = null;   public List&lt;Node&gt; Children = new List&lt;Node&gt;();   public string Name; } </code></pre>  <p>I need to do a deep copy of original tree and avoid changing of new tree when original tree is changed. I know only how to do shallow copy:</p>  <pre><code>public Node Copy(Node original) {   Node newNode = new Node();   newNode.Parent = original.Parent;   newNode.Children = original.Children;   newNode.Name = original.Name;    return newNode; } </code></pre>  <p>In this case I copy both Nodes point to on object in memory and when original node changed a newNode will be changed to. Could anyone help me to do deep cloning?</p>
