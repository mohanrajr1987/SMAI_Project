<p>I'm facing a problem I using the <code>FSEvent</code> to catch the file created in my app but I also want to check the file extension (ex: photo/ video type) are allowed, otherwise these files will not be copied. How can I check the file extension before copying in Cocoa? Any suggestion would be appreciated. Thanks</p>  <p><strong>Please note I don't use <code>NSFileManager</code> to copy file.</strong></p>
