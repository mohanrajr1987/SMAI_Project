<p>I am trying to copy data from worksheet 1 (Designer) to worksheet 2 (Production), if column AG has a value of 'x'.  After paste is complete, clear data from column AG.  My data, could have a specific range of say 6,000 rows but would rather keep it variable if possible as the data will grow with time.  Below is the code in which I am working with, my original data is in columns AH to AP on Designer tab.  Any input is much appreciated.</p>  <pre><code>Private Sub CommandButton1_Click() Dim N As Long, i As Long, j As Long Set s1 = Sheets("Designer") Set s2 = Sheets("Production") Set t1 = s1.Range("AH2:AP6000").Copy N = s1.Cells(Rows.Count, "AG").End(xlUp).Row j = 1 For i = 1 To N     If s1.Cells(i, "AG").Value = "" Then     Else     s1.Cells(i, "AG").t1         If Sheets("Production").Range("A1").Offset(1, 0) &lt;&gt; "" Then Selection.PasteSpecial Paste:=xlPasteValues, Operation:=xlNone, SkipBlanks _     :=False, Transpose:=False     j = j + 1     End If Worksheets("Designer").Select Range("AG2:AG6000").ClearContents End If Next i End Sub  </code></pre>  <p>I have also tried this code:</p>  <pre><code>Private Sub CommandButton1_Click() Dim ColumAG As Range Set ColumnAG = Range("AG:AG")  Dim ColumAH As Range Set ColumnAH = Worksheets("Designer").Range("AH:AH")  Dim ColumAI As Range Set ColumnAI = Worksheets("Designer").Range("AI:AI")  Dim ColumAJ As Range Set ColumnAJ = Worksheets("Designer").Range("AJ:AJ")  Dim ColumAK As Range Set ColumnAK = Worksheets("Designer").Range("AK:AK")  Dim ColumAL As Range Set ColumnAL = Worksheets("Designer").Range("AL:AL")  Dim ColumAM As Range Set ColumnAM = Worksheets("Designer").Range("AM:AM")  Dim ColumAN As Range Set ColumnAN = Worksheets("Designer").Range("AN:AN")  Dim ColumAO As Range Set ColumnAO = Worksheets("Designer").Range("AO:AO")  Dim ColumAP As Range Set ColumnAP = Worksheets("Designer").Range("AP:AP")  Dim N As Long, i As Long, j As Long Set s1 = Sheets("Designer") Set s2 = Sheets("Production") Set s3 = Sheets("Designer").Range("AH:AP") N = s1.Cells(Rows.Count, "AG").End(xlUp).Row j = 1 For i = 1 To N     If s1.Cells(i, "AG").Value = "" Then     Else     s1.Cells(i, "AG").s3.Copy.s2.Range("AG" &amp; Rows.Count).End(xlUp).Row 1     j = j + 1     End If     Next i Worksheets("Designer").Select Range("AG2:AG6000").ClearContents End Sub </code></pre>
