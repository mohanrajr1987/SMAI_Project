<p>I'm writing a stand-alone program to copy multiple PSTs to a single, new PST.  When there are duplicates of an email, I'd like just 1 copy, not all of them.</p>  <p>As it stands, my code is:</p>  <pre><code>if (item is Outlook.MailItem) {     Outlook.MailItem i = item as Outlook.MailItem;     Outlook.MailItem iCopy = i.Copy();     iCopy.Move(targetMAPIFolder); } </code></pre>  <p>Outlook is able to produce the desired results manually by choosing: File > Open > Import > Import from another program or file > Outlook data file > Replace duplicates with items imported.</p>  <p>Thanks for your help!</p>
