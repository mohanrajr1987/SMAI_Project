<p>I don't understand how the <code>copy</code> function works based on the documentation:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The copy built-in function copies elements from a source slice into a   destination slice. (As a special case, it also will copy bytes from a   string to a slice of bytes.) The source and destination may overlap. Copy   returns the number of elements copied, which will be the minimum of   len(src) and len(dst).</p> </blockquote>  <pre><code>func copy(dst, src []Type) int </code></pre>
