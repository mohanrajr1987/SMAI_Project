<p>I encounter an error when copying files inside a directory from another computer in a shared network using PHP. Basically here is the code i am using, the recursive function created by  @authorAidan Lister  to copy whole directories. <strong>It is working on my local machine if I use a local file directory</strong>, but when I change it to a directory from another computer it gives me an error concerning permissions. </p>  <p>I am sure that I took care of the permissions concerning folder access because I have gone as far as to allow "Everyone" to be able to have full access to the folder for testing purposes , but it still doesn't work. I am lost and have exhasuted all options I can think of.</p>  <p><strong>PHP</strong> is the name of my local machine.</p>  <p><strong>VMSTBOX</strong> is the name of the computer with the files i am trying to access.</p>  <p>Also, when I use " chmod("\\VMSTBOX\Users", 0777); "in my PHP code.It also gives me a "permission denied " error. I think this is related to my issue.</p>  <p>I have posted a chunk of my source code below along with the error message below. Thanks for any help</p>  <pre><code>function xcopy($source, $dest, $permissions = 0777)  {     // Check for symlinks   if (is_link($source)) {         return symlink(readlink($source), $dest);     }      // Simple copy for a file     if (is_file($source)) {         return copy($source, $dest);     }      // Make destination directory     if (!is_dir($dest)) {         mkdir($dest, $permissions);     }      // Loop through the folder     $dir = dir($source);     while (false !== $entry = $dir-&gt;read()) {         // Skip pointers         if ($entry == '.' || $entry == '..') {             continue;         }          // Deep copy directories         xcopy("$source/$entry", "$dest/$entry", $permissions);     }      // Clean up     $dir-&gt;close();     return true;   $filelocation="\\\VMSTBOX\\Files";  $newfilelocation="\\\\PHP\\VarTemptoCopy";  $status = xcopy($filelocation, $newfilelocation); </code></pre>  <p><em>CODE ENDS HERE</em></p>  <p>Here is the error message i keep getting.</p>  <p>"Warning: dir(\VMSTBOX\Files,\VMSTBOX\Files): Access is denied.
