<p>Part 1: Copy Script</p>  <p>I have scripts on my computer that I want to continue to develop. These scripts work as embed scripts in maya files, so that people who open the file will get the tool upon opening it. I want to build in an update function, so that when I open the file, the version in the file will check against my local version, and if my local version is a higher version number, it will update to my script. I know how to replace the string value in maya, but i'm not certain how to copy the string value from an existing python file.</p>  <p>How can I copy the text from within a script to a string value? (preferably containing /n and indentation, while I'm at it)</p>  <pre><code>version = 3.1 Try:     import ToolBox     if ToolBox.version &gt; version:         #do copy stuff </code></pre>  <p>Part 2: Multiple Script Files</p>  <p>My script uses several separate files (simplified concept bellow)</p>  <pre><code>file Hammer     class Type():         #force stuff     def strike():         #strike stuff file Nail     Class Type():         #Type stuff     def bindTogether():         #bind stuff file Wood     #wood stuff..  file ToolBox     Import Hammer     Import Nail     Import Wood     def buildBox():         #buildBox stuff using hammer, nail and wood </code></pre>  <p>Can I import these into a class within my script and use them pretty much the same as I am now? If not, what can I do?</p>  <pre><code>File Toolbox     Class Hammer:         class Type():             #force stuff         def strike():             #strike stuff     Class Nail:         Class Type():             #Type stuff         def bindTogether():             #bind stuff     Class Wood:         #wood stuff      def buildBox():         #buildBox stuff using hammer, nail and wood </code></pre>
