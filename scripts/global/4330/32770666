<p>I have code that copies data from Sheet1 in Workbook1 to Sheet2 in Workbook2:</p>  <pre><code>Sub Copydata() Application.ScreenUpdating = False Application.DisplayAlerts = False  Dim x As Workbook Dim y As Workbook  Set x = Workbooks.Open("C:\Users\User1\Documents\Workbook1.xlsx") Set y = Workbooks.Open("C:\Users\User1\Documents\Workbook2.xlsx") With x.Sheets("Sheet1").UsedRange     'Now, paste to y worksheet:     y.Sheets("Sheet2").Range("A1").Resize( _         .Rows.Count, .Columns.Count) = .Value End With x.Close y.Close SaveChanges:=True End Sub </code></pre>  <p>This code works fine and copies the data only if workbook2 is closed. If I run this code from workbook2 by opening the file, the results won't be copied to this workbook.  </p>  <p>Can't we copy results to the opened workbook?</p>
