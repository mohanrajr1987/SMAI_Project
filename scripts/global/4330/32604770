<p>Consider there are 3 csv files , csv1, csv2 and csv3. I have to combine these files to a new xls file 'csv_total' . The way it has to be copied is. First i have to open csv1 and copy all its contents and paste it to the first sheet of xls 'csv_total' and rename the first sheet as'csv1'. simillarly i have to copy 'csv2' to the 2nd sheet of 'csv_total' and the sheet has to be renamed to 'csv2'. This process has to be repeated for as many csv files i have. </p>  <p>Is there a way to automate this process? . 'KuTools' is an option i found but it accepts only 'xls' files as inputs not 'csv' files. </p>  <p>Kindly provide me suggestions.</p>
