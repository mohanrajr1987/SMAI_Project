<p>I have a REXX program, running in Windows 10, that makes thousands of copies of the same file, all on C:, for a total of tens of gigabytes. The strange thing is that the time per copy varies unpredictably, by as much as a factor of 10, over the course of the process. Monitoring the process I can see that initially it runs very quickly until the cache is full, and then it slows down dramatically, which I guess I can understand. But even after that it can slow even more and then speed up again.</p>  <p>I don't start any other processes while this one is running. Anything automatic, such as an online check for updates to some app, would only run for a few seconds, but the slow periods can last 20-30 minutes. I never see any competing processes in Task Manager.</p>  <p>Can anyone explain this or suggest a way to improve the performance? Thanks.</p>
