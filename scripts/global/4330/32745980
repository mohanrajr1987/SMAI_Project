<p>I'm using AutoFilter to delete some rows before a different macro is run. One of my filters brings up some notes that I need to save for later pasting. I assume saving it to a variable will allow me to then delete those rows and paste them when needed later. Here's what I have so far:</p>  <pre><code>Sub Test()     With Sheet1         .AutoFilterMode = False         With Range("A10", Range("A" &amp; Rows.Count).End(xlUp))             On Error Resume Next             .AUTOFILTER Field:=1, Criteria1:="=(**", Operator:=xlFilterValues             'Insert code to copy values to variable here             .Offset(1, 0).Resize(.Rows.Count - 1, 1).SpecialCells(xlCellTypeVisible).EntireRow.Delete         End With         .AutoFilterMode = False     End With End Sub </code></pre>  <p>I can't figure out how to copy the visible cells to a variable. Tried using xlCellTypeVisible but it didn't work. </p>
