<p>I am trying to get data from multiple worksheets and paste into sheet 1 but my code isnt working properly. It keeps copying from the sheet "table 1" over and over again. Does anyone know what is wrong with my code?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>  <pre><code>Option Explicit  Sub test()  Dim ws As Worksheet Dim i As Integer      For Each ws In ThisWorkbook.Worksheets         If ws.Name &lt;&gt; "Table 1" Then              ActiveSheet.Range("A15:X35").Select             Selection.Copy              Worksheets("Table 1").Activate                  For i = 1 To 5000                      If IsEmpty(Cells(i, 1)) = True And IsEmpty(Cells(i + 1, 1)) = True Then                     ActiveSheet.Cells(i, 1).Select                     ActiveSheet.Paste                     Exit For                     End If                  Next i          End If     Next ws  End Sub </code></pre>
