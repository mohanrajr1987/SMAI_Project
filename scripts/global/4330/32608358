<p>I made an application that copy directory from one location to another, the application and the copy process works fine when I try to copy from an external hard disk to the computer, from the computer to an external hard disk, from an external hard disc to another one and from the computer to the computer. Today I ran some tests on my application and weird thing happened. I have an external hard disc that includes the C volume from my previous computer, when I tried to copy it to another computer the application copied directories and files from the destination computer. For example, when the application try to copy the users folder it gets and copy the users from the destination computer and not from the volume on the external hard disk. My application uses a recursive function that gets all the sub folders and the sub files from the selected path but somehow when it try to get  and copy the users folder from the external hard disk volume it copy the users folder from the destination computer C volume. I checked the paths and everything is fine. What is the problem and why the application could not regonize/copy from the external hard disk volume?</p>
