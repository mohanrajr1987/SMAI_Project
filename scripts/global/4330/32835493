<p>I'm pretty new in <code>C</code> and would like to ask a question about copying behavior. I'm reading <code>Scott Meyers</code>' C++ and he said in the book that <code>C++</code> may be considered as a composition of languages and we should distinguish the so called <strong>C part</strong> from the <code>C++</code> part. Now if we have to use some native <code>C</code> API containing the following:</p>  <pre><code>FontHandle getFont(); //From, C API  void releaseFont(FontHandle fh); //From the same C API </code></pre>  <p>As far as I know, the <code>C</code> language doesn't allow defining a custom copying behavior via copy-custructors. So, what should I expect to happen if I write the following:</p>  <pre><code>FontHandle f1 = getFont(); FontHandle f2 = f1; //What's going to happen here? Deep or shallow copy? </code></pre>
