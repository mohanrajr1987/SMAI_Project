<p>I have the same code copy pasted in different classes with only the name of the storyboard that changes. How can i do that in a way that i can reduce the copy/paste effect ? I have many many classes with the same code. Using Xcode 7</p>  <p><strong><em>EDIT</em></strong>: I'm sorry. It's actually the name of a CLASS that changes. For example : " ... as! ViewController1 " .</p>  <pre><code>let fromViewController = transitionContext.viewControllerForKey(UITransitionContextFromViewControllerKey) as! ViewController1 </code></pre>
