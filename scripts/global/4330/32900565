<p>I would like to copy a specific file <code>style.css</code> to several directories css folder by the use of gulp, for exmple:</p>  <pre><code>Project - directory 1  - css - directory 2  - css - directory 3  - css - directory 4  - css - style.css </code></pre>  <hr>  <p>As far as I understood, gulp can only copy <strong>a file or several files</strong> into <strong>one directory</strong> not several directories. </p>  <pre><code>gulp.task('copy', function() {   return gulp.src('project/style.css')     .pipe(gulp.dest('project')); }); </code></pre>  <p>Consider that I know it is possible to write several <code>gulp.dest</code> but I need a dynamic way to handle many directory. So is there any solution out there?</p>
