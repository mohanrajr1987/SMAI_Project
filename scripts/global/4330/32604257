<p>I'm quite a beginner in java. While writing a code for a little project I stumbled upon a problem which after many tries I still wasn't able to solve. I got a small class which only stores a 2d-array:</p>  <pre><code>class Board{     int[][] Field;      Board(int[][] field){       Field=field;     }      Board(Board Test){       this.Field=Test.Field;     }      public void change(int x, int y, int number){       Field[y][x]=number;     }      public void Print(){       System.out.println(Arrays.toString(Field[0]);       System.out.println(Arrays.toString(Field[1]);       System.out.println(Arrays.toString(Field[2]);     } } </code></pre>  <p>My intention is the following:</p>  <ol> <li>Create an object Test1 with a testarray.</li> <li>Create an object Test2 which has an independent copy ob the testarray from Test1.</li> <li>Change something on the testarray of Test2.</li> </ol>  <p>I tried this with the following code:</p>  <pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) {    int[][] testarray={ {0,0,0},                       {0,0,0},                       {0,0,0}};    Board Test1=new Board(testarray);    //creates the object Test1 with the testarray   Board Test2=new Board(Test1);        //creates the object Test2 with the object Test 1 as model   Test2.change(1,1,1);                 //changes something on the array of Test 2   Test2.Print();                       //prints the array of Test2   Test1.Print();                       //prints the array of Test1  } </code></pre>  <p>But when I execute the code, the array of the object Test1 is changed on the exact same way as I changed the array of the object Test 2! I've already searched on this forum and found many similar post. There are also various ideas how to solve this, but I tried many of them (as use the method clone(), or arraycopy() etc.)  and none of them works for my problem (or I was just stupid). As I have read, the problem is probably the "this" statement. I would be really really grateful if anyone could come up with a bit of code, which can copy my object without changing the original one!</p>  <p>Thanks alot!</p>
