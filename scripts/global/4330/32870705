<p>If the security level is set to at least 'Medium' in IE (tested in Edge &amp; 11) when you execute a execCommand('copy') command, the browser prompts you, asking if you wan to allow the page to manipulate your clipboard. </p>  <p>My problem is, that if you click on 'Don't allow', the execCommand('copy') still returns <strong>true</strong>. Also, no errors are thrown.</p>  <p>How can I catch and handle this user response?</p>
