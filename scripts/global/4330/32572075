<p>I took it for granted that if I have a wordpad on my left side of screen, and my Java Swing app with a JTextfield on the right side of screen, I can copy text using ctrl-C from the wordpad then ctrl-V the text into the Java Swing app's JTextfiled, but nothing happens.</p>  <p>I've recently replaced the hard drive, and installed Win7, Java ... so I'm not sure this behavior is because I've re-installed everything, or it is like this as normal, what should I do to enable text copy and paste ?</p>
