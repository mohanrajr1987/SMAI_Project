<p>I've written a code that would copy data from a bunch of Excel workbooks (paths are read from a dedicated txt file) to a master sheet. The issue I'm having right now is that instead of checking for and pasting in the next available row in the MASTER workbook, the code is checking for the next available row in the source workbooks and pasting in the corresponding row number in the master workbook.</p>  <p>Here's what I have atm. Please have a look</p>  <hr>  <pre><code>Open PathFile For Input As #1  Do Until EOF(1)      Line Input #1, SourceFile      Set Source = Workbooks.Open(SourceFile)      With Source.Sheets("Action Tracker")         lastRow = .Range("F" &amp; .Rows.Count).End(xlUp).Row          For i = 10 To lastRow             If Len(Trim(.Range("F" &amp; i).Value)) &lt;&gt; 0 Then                 If CopyRange Is Nothing Then                     Set CopyRange = .Rows(i)                 Else                     Set CopyRange = Union(CopyRange, .Rows(i))                 End If             End If         Next          If Not CopyRange Is Nothing Then             CopyRange.Copy ThisWorkbook.Sheets("MasterSheet").Rows(Range("F100000").End(xlUp).Offset(1, 0).Row)         End If      End With      Source.Close SaveChanges:=False     CB.Clear     Set CopyRange = Nothing  Loop </code></pre>
