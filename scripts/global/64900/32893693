<p>I am attempting to test a meteor application using Jasmine built on Velocity. When I test the application behind our corporate proxy, Karma does not start, the tests don't run, and I get this error in my Jasmine logs:</p>  <pre><code>stream error Error during WebSocket handshake: Unexpected response code: 301 </code></pre>  <p>Presumably because it cannot connect to Karma.</p>  <p>I have tried this outside of our intranet (with no proxy), and it works just fine. Unfortunately, it isn't really feasible to run tests outside of our network. </p>  <p>Is there a setting that I am missing that would make this work?</p>  <p>Edit: I have answered my own question just in case it is helpful to anyone who is having the same problem, but I'm open to other solutions. I will accept another solution if it solves this problem. </p>
