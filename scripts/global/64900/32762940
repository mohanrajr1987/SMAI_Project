<p>I'm using protractor with jasmine 1.3, tried adding a custom matcher to my spec using the example <a href="http://jasmine.github.io/1.3/introduction.html" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>  <pre><code>    beforeEach(function () {         utils.log("beforeEach");          this.addMatchers({             toBeGoofy: function (expected) {                  if (expected === undefined) {                     expected = '';                 }                 var pass = this.actual.hyuk === "gawrsh" + expected;                 if (pass) {                     this.message = "Expected " + this.actual + " not to be quite so goofy";                 } else {                     this.message = "Expected " + this.actual + " to be goofy, but it was not very goofy";                 }                  return pass;             },         });     }); </code></pre>  <p>note that I didn't change anything from their example. after that, i try using it inside an "it" like that:</p>  <pre><code>expect({ "hyuk": "j" }).toBeGoofy(); </code></pre>  <p>and i get an error:</p>  <pre><code>TypeError: undefined is not a function </code></pre>  <p>on the line that the matcher was used on.. any help?</p>
