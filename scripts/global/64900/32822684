<p>Im testing a javascript application and wonder if there are any risks(security, performance etc.) when your src-file to be tested stays in the /src-folder when deploying the javascript application.</p>  <p>I have tested the application and the spec-files is in the /spec-folder and the src-files that i tested is left in the /src-folder. Is there anything I need to change before deploying the application?</p>
