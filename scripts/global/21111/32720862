<p>All I want to do is add a background color to a button for all states. But I want to maintain the automatic focus shadow that you get "for free" when using a system button in the <code>tvOS</code> storyboard. So far I haven't been able to find a combination that allows this.</p>  <p>Alternatively, I would also be interested in a way to programmatically add the shadow when the button is focused, but short of subclassing the button (which I haven't yet tried), I don't know how to do that either.</p>
