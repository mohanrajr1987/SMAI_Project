<p>I'm loading the image of <code>UIButton</code> via web as:</p>  <pre><code>NSURL *imageURL = [NSURL URLWithString:[ruleImageArr objectAtIndex:0]]; NSData *data = [NSData dataWithContentsOfURL:imageURL]; [self.classicBackgroundButton setImage:image forState:(UIControlStateNormal)]; </code></pre>  <p>Which is working fine. So when user taps on it I want the button to <code>setTint</code>. Here is how I'm doing it:</p>  <pre><code>- (IBAction)classicBackgroundButtonPressed:(id)sender {     [self.classicBackgroundButton setTintColor:[UIColor greenColor]]; } </code></pre>  <p>But it's not working. Can't seems to figure out whee the problem is? I've searched it around on stackOverFlow but its mostly how I can replace the <code>UIButton</code> image on tap. These images are loading from web and selecting them should highlight them to give a feel that this button is selected. Any Help would be apperciated.</p>
