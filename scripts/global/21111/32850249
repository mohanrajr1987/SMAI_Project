<p>Currently I have multiple <code>UIButton</code>s that have an image on the left side (added through the IB). I'd like to add a UIImageView subview to the buttons programatically  to the right side. Currently I am doing it in this manner:</p>  <pre><code>UIImageView *rightArrow = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"menu-arrow.png"]]; rightArrow.frame = CGRectMake(button.frame.size.width - 32, button.frame.size.height/2 - 9, 17, 17); rightArrow.tag = 22; [button addSubview:rightArrow]; </code></pre>  <p>This works great in adding the button and placing it on the right side. However, doing this in the <code>ViewDidLoad</code> method creates issues. In the IB the width of the button is the width of the view. So in the <code>ViewDidLoad</code> method the button's width hasn't been changed by autolayout. So it doesn't show up on the far right side.</p>  <p>So I moved it to the <code>ViewDidLayoutSubviews</code>. But on iOS 8, this is called multiple times! And on iOS 7 it's called once! Also, in iOS 8 the LAST call by <code>ViewDidLayoutSubviews</code> is the most accurate in terms of placing the image!</p>  <p>How can I solve this particular issue? Also I'd like to do this programatically rather than try and mess with the IB if possible. </p>  <p>Edit: Turns out the best answer (IMO) was from Mr. T (in the comments) which stats putting the code in <code>ViewDidAppear</code> and then doing a check if you've already added the <code>ImageView</code>to the button. </p>
