<p>I'm learning Swift, still have some confusing things in my head. I want to create simple button like on the following image: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ls2cP.jpg" rel="nofollow">Simple button with gradient and text</a>.</p>  <p>I want to do it in code like this:</p>  <pre><code>let button = MyButton(withColor:.greenColor(), andText:"Hello World!") view.addSubview(button)  // Create Auto Layout constraints for button... </code></pre>  <p>Class MyButton extends UIButton. There are few questions:</p>  <ol> <li>I want to be able to create MyButton from code (as example above) <strong>and</strong> from StoryBoard (by setting class in Identity tab);</li> <li>I want to use Auto Layout, I <strong>don't want</strong> to set frame when I create the button. As I know I forced to use init(frame:) initializer. Maybe I have to create convenience initializer for this case, but how?</li> <li>Should I use UIButton in my case? What are benefits compare to empty UIComponent? I can create background, label, etc. myself;</li> <li>Should I override drawRect() for updating rounded background rectangle?</li> </ol>  <p>Could anybody give an example of MyButton class?</p>
