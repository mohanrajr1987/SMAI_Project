<p>Confession: I have been through every possible link I could find, but unfortunately none work for me. </p>  <p>I am creating buttons dynamically. When a button is selected, it should change the color of the selected button and the rest should remain the default color. This way, the user can identify which button is selected.</p>  <p>Suppose there are 3 buttons: all blue in color, and when I select the first one, it should change to white and other two should remain blue. When I select the second, the first one should go back to blue and the second should now be white.</p>  <p><strong>btnCounts</strong> data I am fetching from server and would vary.</p>  <pre><code>  -(void)createButtons{     for (int i=0; i&lt;btnCounts; i++) {        UIButton *btn = [UIButton buttonWithType:UIButtonTypeRoundedRect];        [btn setTag:i];        [btn setFrame:CGRectMake(xVal, 0, width/btnCounts, 40)];       // [btn setImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"btn_image.png"] forState:UIControlStateNormal];        [btn setBackgroundImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"blue.png"] forState:UIControlStateNormal];        [btn setBackgroundImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"white.png"] forState:UIControlStateSelected];        [btn setTitle:name forState:UIControlStateNormal];        [btn setTitleColor:[UIColor whiteColor] forState:UIControlStateNormal];        [btn addTarget:self action:@selector(btnClicked:) forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchUpInside];        [scrV addSubview:btn];        xVal += self.view.frame.size.width/btnCounts+1;      }  } </code></pre>  <p>Now, in <strong>btnClicked:</strong> method I am passing the button as a parameter, so that I can use selected button.</p>  <pre><code> -(void)btnClicked:(UIButton *)button  {      int tag = (int)button.tag;      //...  } </code></pre>  <p>Please help me to find what I am missing here.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
