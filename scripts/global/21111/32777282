<p>What is the best way of creating those blocks or letters and for the letter holders like they did in here: (IconPopMania iOS app)</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/HKqhf.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/HKqhf.png" alt="enter image description here"></a> <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/mjpmi.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/mjpmi.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>What have I done so far? I've created the button part on the xib as <code>UIButton's</code> like that:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/XjxGy.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/XjxGy.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>All the <code>UIButton's</code> are part of Outlet Collection:</p>  <p><code>@IBOutlet var buttonCollection: [UIButton]!</code></p>  <p>But for the answer part, I created a <code>UIScrollView</code> and draw a <code>UIButton's</code> on top of it with the correct clicked letter:</p>  <pre><code>let button = UIButton(type: UIButtonType.Custom) button.setTitle(String(letter!), forState: UIControlState.Normal) button.frame = CGRectMake(startDrawX, startDrawY, self.sizeOfButtonForAnswer.width, self.sizeOfButtonForAnswer.height) button.backgroundColor = UIColor.redColor() self.vAnswerScroller.addSubview(button) </code></pre>  <p>What is my problem? I'm kinda stuck and need guidance, I don't know how to do the part of the letter holders, how to calculate the number of words and how many words can fit in one row, because there are answers with 1-2 and 3 words and each word is in a different length.. so i'm kinda confused.</p>  <p>Maybe there is another way to implement it? Maybe using UICollectionView or something like that?</p>  <p>I didn't use UICollectionView because when you click on a letter in the bottom section it has to disappear and appear in the upper part (in the first available place), but when you click on a letter on the upper part, it has to return to the place it were at start.</p>
