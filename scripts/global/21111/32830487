<p>I'm trying to implement drag controls with boundary limitation on UIButton. And I wrote following code for that.</p>  <pre><code>- (void)onTouchDragInside:(UIButton*)btn withEvent:(UIEvent*)event{   UITouch *touch = [[event touchesForView:btn] anyObject];   CGPoint prevPos = [touch previousLocationInView:btn];   CGPoint pos = [touch locationInView:btn];   float dX = pos.x-prevPos.x;    if (btn.frame.origin.x &gt;= buttonOffPosition &amp;&amp; btn.frame.origin.x &lt;= buttonOnPosition) {     btn.center=CGPointMake(btn.center.x+dX, btn.center.y);     NSLog(@"buttonOffPos: %f", buttonOffPosition);     NSLog(@"btn.center.x+dX: %f", btn.center.x+dX);     NSLog(@"buttonOnPos: %f", buttonOnPosition);   } } </code></pre>  <p>This works almost properly. But only when the button is dragged <em>very fast</em>, it exceeds the limitation <code>buttonOffPosition</code> and <code>buttonOnPosition</code>. </p>  <p>This is the problem I want to resolve. Is there a good way to solve this problem?</p>  <p>Your thoughts and help will be hugely appreciated.</p>
