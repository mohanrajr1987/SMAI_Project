<p>I want to maximize <code>f(x)= x.^2</code> in the range [0-10], so I used the Ga-optimtool in Matlab. I have done it successfully using the Ga-optimtool, but I want to output to the command window the value of <code>x</code> for every iteration.</p>  <p>How can I write an output function that prints the <code>x</code> value for each iteration along with its fitness?</p>  <p>I have tried the Ga tool box in Matlab, but I don't know how to write a custom function for displaying output.</p>  <p>My code:</p>  <pre><code>function z= fitness_square(x)    m= -(x(1)^2);    z=m;   % this is to find minimum value      % if you want to find maximum value then write m=-(x(1)^2);    %z= min(m);    end </code></pre>
