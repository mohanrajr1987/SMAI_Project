<p>I'm trying to create a basic form that calculates values, in which the max output value is 10. I'm pretty sure it can be done (and odds are, easily so) I'm just not experienced enough to come up with a solution. And searching several forums for output attributes and max value hasn't shed too much light on the matter so far.</p>  <p>So, this is what I have:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;form oninput="c.value = parseInt(a.value) + parseInt(b.value)"&gt; &lt;input name="a" type="number"&gt; + &lt;input name="b" type="number"&gt; = &lt;output name="c" max="10"&gt;&lt;/output&gt; &lt;/form&gt; </code></pre>  <p>And I don't understand why I can't use max="10" as an attribute, or what else I should do to make it work.</p>  <p>Please, could anybody point me in the right direction and tell me what I'm missing?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
