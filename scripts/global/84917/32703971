<p>I have built many different lists on Stata through the <code>l</code> command and would like to export the output to a Latex file. I sort the individuals by a given variable and then list them in the correct order.</p>  <p>An example of the code I run on Stata:<br> <code>gsort -not l varlist, string(16)</code></p>  <p>I use <code>listtex</code> to do so and I have:</p>  <p><code>listtex varlist using"some tex file", type rstyle(tabular)head("\begin{tabular}{l*{6}{c}}" "\textit{first column}&amp;\textit{second}&amp;\textit{third}&amp;...") foot("\end{tabular}")</code></p>  <p>Which gives me the code on my Latex file but I still have to redo the spacing in the different columns and add some code after <code>\begin{tabular}</code> for it to work.  Am I doing something wrong or missing something? Or is it just the best output one can get through <code>listtex</code>?</p>
