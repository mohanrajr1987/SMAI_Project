<p>I'm using the northwind db: <a href="http://dev.assets.neo4j.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/Northwind_diagram.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://dev.assets.neo4j.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/Northwind_diagram.jpg</a></p>  <p>I have to output all orders placed by CustomerID ALFKI with more than one unique product. I get the correct orders out, but I can't figure out why it's only printing one product name per order.</p>  <p>My query:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT a.OrderID, p.ProductName FROM Products p  INNER JOIN 'Order Details' a    ON (p.ProductID = a.ProductID)  INNER JOIN Orders b    ON (a.OrderID = b.OrderID)  WHERE (b.CustomerID = 'ALFKI')  GROUP BY a.OrderID  HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT a.ProductID) &gt; 1 </code></pre>
