<p>I've been working on this code and everything seems to be working, but when MyProgrammingLab actually runs my code it says there is a problem with my standard output.</p>  <p><strong>Here is the problem:</strong></p>  <p>Write a Temperature class  that will hold a temperature in Fahrenheit and provide methods  to get the temperature in Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin. The class  should have the following field:</p>  <p>• ftemp: a double  that holds a Fahrenheit temperature.</p>  <p>The class  should have the following methods :</p>  <p>• Constructor : The constructor  accepts a Fahrenheit temperature (as a double ) and stores  it in the ftemp field. • setFahrenheit: The set Fahrenheit method  accepts a Fahrenheit temperature (as a double ) and stores  it in the ftemp field. • getFahrenheit: Returns the value  of the ftemp field as a Fahrenheit temperature (no conversion  required) • getCelsius: Returns the value  of the ftemp field converted to Celsius. Use the following formula to convert to Celsius: Celsius = (5/9) * (Fahrenheit - 32) • getKelvin: Returns the value  of the ftemp field converted to Kelvin. Use the following formula to convert to Kelvin: Kelvin = ((5/9) * (Fahrenheit - 32)) + 273</p>  <p>Demonstrate the Temperature class  by writing a separate program  that asks the user for a  Fahrenheit temperature. The program  should create an instance of the Temperature class , with the value  entered by the user passed to the constructor . The program  should then call the object 's methods  to display the temperature in the following format (for example, if the temperature in Fahrenheit was -40):</p>  <p>The temperature in Fahrenheit is -40.0 The temperature in Celsius is -40.0 The temperature in Kelvin is 233.0 </p>  <p><strong>And now here is my code:</strong></p>  <p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false"> <div class="snippet-code"> <pre class="snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override"><code>import java.io.*; import java.util.Scanner;   public class Temperature { 	private double ftemp; 	 	public Temperature(double ftemp) 	{ 		this.ftemp = ftemp; 	} 	public void setFahrenheit(double ftemp) 	{ 		this.ftemp = ftemp; 	} 	public double getFahrenheit() 	{ 		return ftemp; 	} 	public double getCelsius() 	{ 		return (5.0/9.0) * (ftemp - 32.0); 	} 	public double getKelvin() 	{ 		return (5.0/9.0) * ((ftemp - 32.0) + 273.0); 	} }   class myTemperature {     public static void main(String[] args) 	{ 		 		Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in); 		double input; 		 		System.out.print("Enter a Fahrenheit temperature:"); 		 		input = keyboard.nextDouble(); 		 		Temperature temp1 = new Temperature(input); 		 		System.out.println("The temperature in Fahrenheit is " + temp1.getFahrenheit()); 		System.out.println("The temperature in Celsius is " + temp1.getCelsius()); 		System.out.println("The temperature in Kelvin is " + temp1.getKelvin()); 	} }</code></pre> </div> </div> </p>  <p><strong>These are the errors it gives me:</strong></p>  <p><a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/0D2RkW7/new" rel="nofollow">http://imgur.com/gallery/0D2RkW7/new</a></p>  <p>I don't have enough rep to post images, sorry!</p>  <p>I really just don't understand what the problem could be, any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
