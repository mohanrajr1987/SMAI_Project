<p>So my question refers to the regress() function in matlab. <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/regress.html" rel="nofollow">Click here for the Matlab documentation</a></p>  <p>If I want to run multiple regressions using this function and output both the coefficients and the confidence intervals, what's the best way to do this in a For loop?</p>  <p>Matlab's own syntax for this is [b,bint] = regress(y,X). But when I try to implement this in a for loop it tells me that the dimension mismatch. My code is the following:</p>  <pre><code>for i=1:6 [a, b]=regress(Dataset(:,i),capm_factors); capm_coefs(i,:)=a; capm_ci(i,:)=b; end </code></pre>  <p>Please help, thanks!</p>
