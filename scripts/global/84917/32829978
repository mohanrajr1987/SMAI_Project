<p>This is a function used to evaluate a certain value <em>f(x)</em> showing diverse approximations in a vector <strong>y</strong>, in order to be compared. Input is a function <em>f</em> (either symbolic or function_handled), a vector of values <strong>n</strong>, and two values <em>x0</em> and <em>x</em>.</p>  <pre><code>g=sym(f); p(1)=subs(g,x0);  k=1;  for i=1:size(n) %Every iteration is an entry of y     while k&lt;=n(i) %Recursive evaluation of the values         g=diff(g);         p(k+1)=subs(g,x0)/factorial(k-1);          k=k+1;     end      y(i)=double(subs(p,x)); end </code></pre>  <p>I want to approximate <em>f(x)</em> as a polynomial a+bx+cx^2+... in every entry, and the while loop calculates a, b, c..., but <strong>y</strong> turns out to be a value, not a vector. Furthermore, if I try to do</p>  <pre><code>[y1 y2]=(function) </code></pre>  <p>A too many output arguments error is displayed. Could you tell me why doesn't MATLAB understand <strong>y</strong> as a vector?</p>
