<p>I'm in the middle of my first assignment, and I'm totally and utterly stuck.</p>  <p>The user inputs the New Purchase Price of their vehicle, eg: $40000, and then the output has to show the dollar amount for Age and Distance Depreciation. These calculations are as follows:</p>  <p><strong>age_depreciation_rate = (years since manufacture date + 1) * 5%</strong></p>  <p><strong>distance_depreciation_rate = (distance_travelled / 10000) * 2%</strong></p>  <p>I'm okay with that part, but the actual output is in a decimal format, e.g: 0.4, which means 40% of New Purchase Price. What I'm trying to work out is how to output as a percentage of the New Purchase Price, so that 0.4 actually converts to 40% and shows the output. E.g: 40% of $40000 = $16000.</p>  <p>If anyone can point me in the right direction, it would be greatly appreciated.</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
