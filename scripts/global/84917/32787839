<p>I am working on a Raspberry PI, and I made a Python application that takes care of communication with a hardware device. This program starts on boot-up. </p>  <p>The person I am making it for wants to be able to see the output of the console of the program while it is running. How can I get the output of a different program? Screen was suggested, but its ability to remotely kill the program with it is not desirable.</p>
