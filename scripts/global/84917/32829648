<p>I'm wondering how to get the output of the 'top' command. I'm looking to obtain the number of currently running processes.</p>  <p>I tried putting it to a text file and got garbage. I'm unsure on how to approach this. My assignment is to determine the number of processes considered by the short-term scheduler for process allocation (processes currently ready to run) at any given time.</p>
