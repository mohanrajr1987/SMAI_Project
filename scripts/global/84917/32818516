<p>Hi I'm trying some C coding on Eclipse, and I had a problem:</p>  <p>I am trying to print some text, however, while awaiting input from the user, the text actually fails to appear until AFTER the user has input. </p>  <p>Here is an example of what I mean: TEST</p>  <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;  int main(void){      char c[5];       printf("test\n");  //PRINTING 'test' BEFORE i have to enter code         fgets(c, 5, stdin);          printf("You entered: %s\n", c);      return 0;  } </code></pre>  <p>OUTPUT:</p>  <pre><code>dog (this is what i typed) test You entered: dog </code></pre>  <p>Rather than appearing BEFORE I am prompted to enter code, the "test" printf only appears AFTER I have entered the code. </p>
