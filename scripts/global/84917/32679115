<p>So, I have this uni exercise, which works all fine, untill I hand it in through domjudge. Then I get a run error on run 1, 3 and 4, while run 2 works fine. The error info says it has to do with a non exhaustive pattern in function printTable : []</p>  <p>But when I add in printTable [] = [] in an attempt to fix it, runs 1, 3 and 4 have no output, probably due to going through the function with the above rule.</p>  <p>I know you guys don't have much information on the runs, but what I find so weird is that in run 2 it is fine, while having problems in all other runs. Help me please ?</p>  <p>Code: <a href="http://pastebin.com/gAyWWQJJ" rel="nofollow">http://pastebin.com/gAyWWQJJ</a></p>  <p>EDIT: Some more information on the input and output:</p>  <p>in and output: <a href="http://pastebin.com/TLJ5MfjL" rel="nofollow">http://pastebin.com/TLJ5MfjL</a></p>  <p>gotten output: []</p>  <p>yes, an empty list.</p>  <p>as you might have seen in the code, it maps words to the [String] it reads from this, so you get [[String]]. then Field = String, Row = [Field] and Table = [Row] = [[Field]] - [[String]].</p>  <p>The input for run 2 should be similar to the one of run 1, but for some reason which I cannot for the love of god find out, run 2 works fine and run 1 doesn't.</p>  <p>I hope to have supplied enough information, because this is really all I have.</p>
