<p>Java Output Formatting topic. What does cin does? Is it character in? I have added comments to the lines I need help to understand. Basically the for loop and the printf command. Rest is all okay.Thanks in advance.</p>  <pre><code>class Solution{ public static void main(String[] args){     Scanner cin=new Scanner(System.in);     System.out.println("================================");     for(;cin.hasNext();){  //what is this doing?         String s=cin.next();         int a=cin.nextInt();          System.out.printf("%-15s%03d\n",s,a); //What is this doing exactly?     }     System.out.println("================================"); } </code></pre>
