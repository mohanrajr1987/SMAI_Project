<p>Test Script:</p>  <pre><code>import boto.ec2 import subprocess  region = 'us-east-1'  conec2 = boto.ec2.connect_to_region(region) reserve = conec2.get_all_instances() instance = instance = [a for r in reserve for a in r.instances]  output=open('output1.txt','w+') for ins in instance:     output.write(str(ins)+'\n') output.close() </code></pre>  <p>This works, but this is just for one variable. I would need the entire output of the script which is bigger in picture with conditional statements to achieve the result I want to. I do get the result that I wish for but I am unable to find a way to dump the result of the script in the same script and the content of the variable will sent as an email. This has to be just one script. I really appreciate your help solving this problem.</p>
