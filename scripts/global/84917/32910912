<p>I have a powershell script that loads a c# .net assembly and calls a method. The method calls Console.WriteLine. When I run the powershell script, the output doesn't show any of the information passed to Console.WriteLine, how can I get it to be output?</p>  <p>Ideally, I'd like the output to start appearing before the .net method returns.</p>  <p>I've seen this <a href="https://www.sapien.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=18&amp;t=4514" rel="nofollow">https://www.sapien.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=18&amp;t=4514</a> is there a better solution?</p>
