<p>I am new to Python and it looks like there is no guidance to this specific issue. I have a <code>matplotlib</code> chart like this: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/1Bg3c.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/1Bg3c.png" alt="My chart without the table"></a></p>  <p>I would like to move the depicted 2D area a bit to the left in order to make some room, on the right hand side, for a table that recaps the most important values.</p>  <p>The thing should look like this: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/b5AkZ.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/b5AkZ.jpg" alt="How the chart should look like with the recap table"></a></p>  <p>I have tried with</p>  <pre><code>tbl = plt.table(     cellText=[["a"], ["b"], ["c"]],     colWidths=[0.25, 0.25, 0.25],     rowLabels=[u"Max depth [m]", u"Min depth [m]", u"Footprint [%]"],     loc="right", bbox=[0.25, -0.5, 0.5, 0.3]) import self self.ui.main_plot.figure.subplots_adjust(right=0.4) </code></pre>  <p>but I do not get the result I want. The numbers <code>value1</code>, <code>value2</code>, and <code>value3</code> are computed each time the script is run, so the table should show the relevant values each time the script is run. How can this be done with <code>matplotlib</code>? Thanks to anyone who will help!</p>
