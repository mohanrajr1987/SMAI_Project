<p>Hi I have a label that contain text but the label has to be in fix size but the text doesn't not, I'm trying to produce the behavior of Windows when you for example right click on a folder and click on property to see the complete path, but if the path was bigger than the label you can highlight it and drag to the end and you can see the rest of the text. How can I do this with Winforms c# </p>  <p>thanks </p>
