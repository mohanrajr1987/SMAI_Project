<p>I want to use <code>DataGridView</code> basically as a fancy list control, where some columns use checkboxes and others allow selecting a value from a drop-down list of possible values.</p>  <p>I want to populate the view from registry key values e.g. the user selects the registry key, and values from that key are used to add rows to the view following some bespoke logic. As the user changes values in the Cells, these should cause the registry to be updated.</p>  <p>I believe an unbound approach (no dataset) is the best option here, manually adding rows and adding on-change event handlers to each cell. But I wanted to check this makes sense, and I'm not trying to force my C++ view of things on to the more sophisticated .NET data-binding approach - am I doing this in a reasonable manner?</p>
