<p>I know there are many discussion this topic already but still i could not find an answer. Hope someone have a idea.</p>  <p>I load a bitmap in a <code>PictureBox</code> (<code>SizeMode</code> Normal, <code>DockStyle</code> Fill) and use the <code>Paint</code> event to draw the image.</p>  <p>To zoom I use <code>MouseWheel</code> event and increase / decrease zoom factor (Like _zoomFac += 1). The goal is to zoom at the mouse position. So in the <code>MouseWheel</code> event I also save the mouse position (<code>_imageZoomLocation</code>). This is my code (only little test implementation):</p>  <pre><code>public partial class Form1 : Form {   private Image _image;   private float _zoomFac;   private PointF _imageZoomLocation;    public Form1()   {     InitializeComponent();     _image = null;     _zoomFac = 1F;     _imageZoomLocation = PointF.Empty;     pictureBox.MouseWheel += new MouseEventHandler(OnMouseWheel);   }    private void pb_Paint(object sender, PaintEventArgs e)   {     if (_image == null)       return;     e.Graphics.TranslateTransform(-_imageZoomLocation.X +    _imageZoomLocation.X / _zoomFac, -_imageZoomLocation.Y +   _imageZoomLocation.Y / _zoomFac);     e.Graphics.ScaleTransform(_zoomFac, _zoomFac, MatrixOrder.Append);     e.Graphics.DrawImage(_image, new Point(0,0));   }    private void fileToolStripMenuItem_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)   {     ... Code for loading image   }    private void OnMouseWheel(object sender, MouseEventArgs e)   {     if (_image == null)       return;      _imageZoomLocation = e.Location;      if (e.Delta &gt; 0)       _zoomFac += 1F;     else       if (_zoomFac - 1F &lt; 1F)         _zoomFac = 1F;       else         _zoomFac -= 1F;      Refresh();   }    private void pb_MouseEnter(object sender, EventArgs e)   {     pictureBox.Focus();   } } </code></pre>  <p>This works well as long as <code>_imageZoomLocation</code> is not changed, means the mouse is not moved i can zoom in and out perfectly (I can change mouse position when zoom factor is 1 and everything still works). However when I move the mouse to different position in a zoomed state (e.g. zoom factor is 2) and scroll, the image jumpes once to a different position than the mouse is and after this "jump" everything works well again. </p>  <p>Can anyone explain this behaviour?</p>
