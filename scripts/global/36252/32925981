<p>I have a chart and I've added it to a panel but as you can see in the picture, the chart does not fill the whole panel. it has a lot of white space that I highlighted in red.</p>  <p>How can I remove this space on the left, right and bottom of my chart so that it fills the panel?</p>  <p>I tried docking it and I also changed its margin property to false but these solutions did not work.</p>  <p>My chart is .NET WinForms chart:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/H1xyO.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/H1xyO.png" alt="My chart is .NET WinForms chart"></a></p>
