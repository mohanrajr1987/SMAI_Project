<p>In Windows form application I am reading an xml from default path to show the data in form. In case the file is not present I have given option to browse the file manually. What I want to give user an option to update the default path of the xml file to newly browsed location? Any suggestion how can I achieve this. Currently I have kept default path in a constant value which can not be updated.</p>  <p>I thought of keeping this xml path and any paths updated in future in an xml file. But I don't want to go with this option mere for storing file paths. </p>
