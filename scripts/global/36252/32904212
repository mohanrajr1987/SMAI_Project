<p>I am have a Windows Forms application and also using SQL to get the data from my db. I have a binded checkListBox in my Windows Forms application and I would like to get the primary key (the value) of <strong>all the checked Items</strong> in my checkListBox. What I realize is in combo box, they have a build in method 'selectedValue' I am wondering if we can do the same thing in checkListBox by looping through the checkedItems in checkListBox and get its value</p>  <p>Let say in my db table, I have: </p>  <pre><code>EmployeeId    Employee Name 1                 Jimmy 2                 Pam 3                 Bob 4                 Kobe </code></pre>  <p>My binded checkListBox showed something like </p>  <pre><code>[x]Jimmy [x]Pam []Bob []Kobe </code></pre>  <p>Can I get the checkedItem item's id by using sql query. Now let say Jimmy and Pam is checked and I want to get their employeeId. I am not sure how to do it. Help will be appreciated.</p>  <pre><code>select * from employee_table where employeeId = '"+checkListBox.SelectedValue+"' </code></pre>  <p>or </p>  <pre><code>foreach(var item = item.CheckedItems{      select * from employee_table where employeeId = '"items"'; } </code></pre>
