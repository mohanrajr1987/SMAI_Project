<p>I'm trying to make a mouse transparent form in win8 and winforms, that contains controls that are clickable.</p>  <p>I'm able to make the form mouse transparent, using this code</p>  <pre><code>int initialStyle = GetWindowLong(this.Handle, -20); SetWindowLong(this.Handle, -20, initialStyle | 0x80000 | 0x20); </code></pre>  <p>(on win8 the WndProc approach does not work)</p>  <p>But when I make the form mouse transparent, the controls that are contained in this form are also mouse transparent</p>  <p>What can I do?</p>
