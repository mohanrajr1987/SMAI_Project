<p>So we have an application that is quite large in size and takes up an average of 75,000kb of memory when it runs (this goes up and back down when opening other windows but not by much). </p>  <p>Recently, we have had a few calls into our support team about the Red Cross Of Doom as it is affectionately called. </p>  <p>This appears on controls that are standard WinForms controls with no customization whatsoever (they are also not placed in any custom containers).</p>  <p>After some research, we found that it seems to only trigger if an exception has occurred in a paint event assigned to that control. However, these controls have no events for painting which means that it must be underlying.</p>  <p>Our thought process is that this may be happening on systems with very low memory but that is a bit of a stab in the dark. Backing up this theory is the fact that this issue is intermittent.</p>  <p><strong>BIG RED CROSS OF DOOM on a datagridview</strong></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/zytOS.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/zytOS.png" alt="Big Red Cross Of Doom DGV"></a></p>  <p><strong>BIG RED CROSS OF DOOM everywhere</strong></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/9KZ4g.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/9KZ4g.png" alt="Big Red Cross Of Doom Everywhere"></a></p>  <p>The question is simply to either confirm our suspicions about the memory issue, or give us another reason, and hopefully a way to get round it.</p>  <p>NOTE :-<br> I know WinForms is a little old now and not really supported but this application is very big and therefore suggestions on converting to WPF or anything else will not be possible.</p>
