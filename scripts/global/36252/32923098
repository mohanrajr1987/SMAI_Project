<p>I tried many versions, but most of the tutorials are made for wpf apps.  Anyway, I can make some kind of grid, but some buttons are out of the form, and the spaceng among them is too large (And of course, if I resize the form, the grid still in the same size).</p>  <p>Here's on of my tries, which isn't works correctly:</p>  <pre><code>int size = 32; _buttonGrid = new Button[size, size]; for (Int32 i = 0; i &lt; size; i++)     for (Int32 j = 0; j &lt; size; j++)     {         _buttonGrid[i, j] = new Button();         _buttonGrid[i, j].Location = new Point( size * j,  size * i);          _buttonGrid[i, j].Size = new Size(flowLayoutPanel1.Width / size, flowLayoutPanel1.Height / size);          _buttonGrid[i, j].Font = new Font(FontFamily.GenericSansSerif, 6, FontStyle.Bold);          _buttonGrid[i, j].Enabled = true;          _buttonGrid[i, j].TabIndex = 10 + i * size + j;          _buttonGrid[i, j].FlatStyle = FlatStyle.Flat; st√≠pus          flowLayoutPanel1.Controls.Add(_buttonGrid[i, j]);     } </code></pre>
