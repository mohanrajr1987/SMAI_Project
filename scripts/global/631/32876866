<p>Im fairly new to PS, im trying to perform a simple task, get list of computers by using the get-content, than though a foreach loop perform a wmi query to each device in the list and  get the OS type, than with a IF statment check perform a different task depends on the OS, everntually win vista 7 8 10 needed to be seperated from xp. I wrote the following PS script :</p>  <pre><code>$computers=Get-Content C:\ComputerList\Computers.txt  $OSType=Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_operatingsystem -namespace "root\CIMV2" -ComputerName $computers     ForEach ( $compdevice in $computers ) {  if ( $OSType.buildnumber -eq "2600*" ) {  Write-Host $compdevice"'s OS type is XP" }  Else  {  Write-Host $compdevice"'s Os type is Newer than xp"   }    } </code></pre>  <p>in this case i get the same result for all computers ( im running the secret againt 2 win xp 1 win 7 and 1 win 8 in a domain envierment.</p>  <p>I've tried a different variation  also :</p>  <pre><code>$computers=Get-Content C:\ComputerList\Computers.txt  $OSType=Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_operatingsystem -namespace "root\CIMV2" -ComputerName $computers     ForEach ( $compdevice in $computers ) {  if ( $OSType.buildnumber -eq "2600*" ) {  Write-Host $compdevice"'s OS type is XP" }  Else  {  Write-Host $compdevice"'s Os type is Newer than xp"   }    } </code></pre>  <p>in both cases i get the exact same results ( all goes to one option of the IF statement )</p>  <p>I wonder, what am I doing wrong ? Note - I was trying to filter by caption, buildnumber and version. and even wild card in the IF statement, it doesn't work well </p>
