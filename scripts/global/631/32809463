<p>I really feel like I'm missing something simple, so I apologize in advance for even having to ask. In Rebol how do you get a string value from a word/variable in a block? I have this code:</p>  <pre><code>REBOL [] aLink: "http://google.com" anAtt: "href" aList: [anAtt aLink] print "Test 1" foreach el aList [ print type? el ] print "Test 2" foreach el2 aList [ print el2] print "Test 3" foreach el2 aList [ print string! el2] </code></pre>  <p>That returns this:</p>  <pre><code>Test 1 word word Test 2 anAtt aLink Test 3 string string </code></pre>  <p>What I'd like up in Test 2 is for it to return the values of aLink and anAtt, but in every combination it returns the word name. What am I doing wrong? I'm doing this in REBOL/Core 2.7.8.4.2 on 32-bit Ubuntu using the 2.3 libc binary.</p>  <p>I've used foreach and blocks in other Rebol programs before and never had this trouble. Help!</p>
