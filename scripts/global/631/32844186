<p>usually when I think there is a bug in the programing languge I discover that I was very stupid, hope this is not the case, any why this is some code that I wrote to understand what is going on, the problem is in the last loop, it echo the second value twice instead the third value.</p>  <pre><code>$b = array("aaaa" =&gt; "AAAA", "bbbb" =&gt; "BBB", "ccc" =&gt; "CCCC");  $value = "123213"; echo "1 - $value\n"; foreach ($b as $key =&gt; $value) {     echo " - $key=$value\n"; }  echo "\n"; foreach ($b as &amp;$value) {     echo $value;     echo "\n"; }  echo "\n after used with &amp; as reference:\n"; print_r($b); echo "\n";  foreach ($b as $value) {     echo $value;     echo "\n"; } </code></pre>  <p>all the code above will output the following:</p>  <pre><code>1 - 123213  - aaaa=AAAA  - bbbb=BBB  - ccc=CCCC  AAAA BBB CCCC   after used with &amp;: Array (     [aaaa] =&gt; AAAA     [bbbb] =&gt; BBB     [ccc] =&gt; CCCC )  AAAA BBB BBB </code></pre>  <p>now as you can see the last run of </p>  <pre><code>foreach ($b as $value) {     echo $value;     echo "\n"; } </code></pre>  <p>missing the value of ccc, looks like it was somehow ran over by something I am not sure what or why, is this a bug in PHP or I missing something very basic here?</p>
