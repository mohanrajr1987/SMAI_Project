<p>I have a foreach loop that will echo out all the selection made by the user from the checkboxes.</p>  <p>I am trying to store the value into a variable called <code>$getCentralArea</code>. However, when I echo <code>$getCentralArea</code> it shows <code>4</code> - only the last value of the selected checked box. The correct value that I should get is <code>1,2,3,4</code>.</p>  <pre><code>if(!empty($_POST['centralArea']))  {     foreach($_POST['centralArea'] as $centralArea)      {         $getCentralValue = $centralArea.","; //Output will be in the following format 1,2,3,4     } }else{ $getCentralArea="";} </code></pre>
