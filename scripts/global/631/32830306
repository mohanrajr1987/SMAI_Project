<p>I need to loop through several jsons and print out index 1 of each...</p>  <p>I start with a generated string containing my JSON data. I then decode the string and dump it to show exactly what I'm working with:</p>  <pre><code>my $decoded = decode_json $string print Dumper $string </code></pre>  <p>This results in the following output:</p>  <pre><code>$VAR1 = [       {         'hdr' =&gt; [                    1,                    'acknowledged',                    '',                    '/home/clanier/dev/test/sds-test/data/JPLIDR2015169.64575',                    '2015/271-19:10:39.0101355',                    '2015/271-19:10:39.2599252',                    ''                  ]       },       {         'hdr' =&gt; [                    2,                    'acknowledged',                    '',                    '/home/clanier/dev/test/sds-test/data/JPLIDR2015169.64575',                    '2015/271-19:10:39.3928414',                    '2015/271-19:10:39.6397269',                    ''                  ]       },       {         'hdr' =&gt; [                    3,                    'acknowledged',                    '',                    '/home/clanier/dev/test/sds-test/data/JPLIDR2015169.64575',                    '2015/271-19:10:39.7726375',                    '2015/271-19:10:40.0162758',                    ''                  ]       }     ]; </code></pre>  <p>Now I try to loop through this and print the word acknowledged for each one:</p>  <pre><code>foreach my $hdr ( $decoded-&gt;{hdr} ) {   print $hdr-&gt;[1]; } </code></pre>  <p>I looked to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8258387/accessing-values-of-json-structure-in-perl">this solution</a> for help, but it appears I cannot even get as far as the original poster, due to "Not a HASH reference" errors. I was able to print a specific one previously, but I need to loop through and print all of them. This was the code for that: <code>print $$decoded[0]-&gt;{'hdr'}-&gt;[1];</code></p>
