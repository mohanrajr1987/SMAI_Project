<p>I have an array of 100 objects with different properties in each object. I am trying to do a for loop through the array to get 1 particular property from each object and push it to a new array. I've tried:</p>  <pre><code> for (var item in response.data) {                 main.allUsers.push(item);             } </code></pre>  <p>And when I console.log(main.allUsers); I get an array that looks like ["0","1", "2", "3", "4"...] .</p>
