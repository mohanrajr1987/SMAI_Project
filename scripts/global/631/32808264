<p>I've been sorting this problem in my head but not getting any success.<br> See the view query in mySQL here:  </p>  <pre><code>SELECT     concat(         Windows_last_options.company,         ' | ',         Windows_last_options.material,         ' | ',         '$',         Windows_last_options.newcost     ) AS options,     round(         (             (                 Windows_last_options.newcost * 0.50             ) + 100         ),         2     ) AS depositcost,     (         trim(             substring_index(                 Windows_last_submissions_ONE.requested,                 'Quantity:' ,- (1)             )         ) + 0     ) AS quantity FROM     (         Windows_last_submissions_ONE         JOIN Windows_last_options     ) </code></pre>  <p>Currently, it will increase 'newcost' by $100.00 for every quantity the user chooses (ie, it will go up $500 if the user chose quantity:5).</p>  <p>What I want is for it to only go up by $100 one time (this is the initial deposit regardless of quantity)- unfortunately it currently goes up by 100 for every quantity over 0.  </p>  <p>I was thinking a foreach but I don't think mysql allows that (I do not know how to store procedural statements).</p>
