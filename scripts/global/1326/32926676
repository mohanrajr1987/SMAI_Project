<p>I am using Fabric.js with a rotation view port transformation applied on the canvas instance.  </p>  <p>With the transform applied I am using free drawing mode to draw some paths on the canvas, the drawings being displayed with respect to the viewport transform.</p>  <p>After that I am trying to export the canvas to SVG, but in my SVG the object looks like it was not rotated at all. This is expected since the transformation was applied in the viewport when the drawing was made.</p>  <p>My problem is that the position of the drawing is not respected, even though it has angle 0. </p>  <p>It has some kind of an offset and is not in the position that I would expected to be if I would rotate it backwards from the original draw position.</p>  <p>How can I preserve its position in the original canvas, regardless of the angle of rotation ?</p>
