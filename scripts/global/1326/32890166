<p>I want to print two area charts in one diagram using dimple.js. I did it like this: </p>  <pre><code>var svg = dimple.newSvg("#chart", svgWidth, svgHeight); var chart = new dimple.chart(svg, data); var xAxis = chart.addCategoryAxis("x", "DayOfMonth"); xAxis.title = null; xAxis.addOrderRule("Date"); var yAxis = chart.addMeasureAxis("y", "Amount"); yAxis.title = null;  var series = chart.addSeries("Type", dimple.plot.area); series.interpolation = "cardinal"; chart.draw(); </code></pre>  <p>Here is a JSFiddle I created: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/7LoLLkfp/1/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/7LoLLkfp/1/</a></p>  <p>The problem is that the two charts are above each other. When you look at the last value for DayOfMonth 20. Views should be at 6 and Likes should be at 4. In my case likes are drawn at 6 + 4 = 10. </p>  <p>How can I correctly draw two area charts in one diagram without stacking them above each other? </p>
