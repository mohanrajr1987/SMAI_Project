<p>I'm looking for a way to to place SVG icon in the center of square and adapt over the length and height of dynamic div. I want to achieve something like that <a href="http://callmenick.com/_development/icons-css3-transitions/index.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>, only without making it went down. It should be always on one line.</p>  <p>It's okay if flex will be involved :)</p>  <p>I thought to add to each square width 15% but the problem that the height is not adjusted.</p>
