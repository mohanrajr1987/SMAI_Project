<p>I have used the sample from D3 brush snapping, ttp://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/6232537. All is working well with its 38 ticks, strange thing is that once the brush move to position 14(extent0[0]) to 30(extent0[1]), user can not move the end brush (extent0[1])any more; the cursor does not change to the drag/brush position as if the browser is not rendering the mouse event. However user can click anywhere on the brush to create a new extent pair for the brush. I googled some performance topic on the brush and some posts mentioned that if there are too many svg elements on the page, it could cause some lagging on the browser(Firefox) rendering, just to add that I'm using chrome only.  Anyone has similar experience or any suggestions? </p>
