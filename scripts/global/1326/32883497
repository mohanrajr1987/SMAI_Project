<p>I'm looking for some way / technology to get the following effect. I would like the website user to have the ability to rotate in three demmension an image, graphic, or  a SVG element by touch or a pointing device (eg. mouse). Here (<a href="http://animateyourhtml5.appspot.com/pres/index.html?lang=en#13" rel="nofollow">http://animateyourhtml5.appspot.com/pres/index.html?lang=en#13</a>) is an example of such a rotation. I would like just replace the auto-animation for manual rotation of the object (actually a set of images).</p>  <p>Will I reach this just using HTML5/CCS3 ? </p>  <p>Maybe someone has some experience in this topic? Could someone share an idea?</p>  <p>I will be grateful for your help.</p>
