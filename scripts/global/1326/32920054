<p>In some graphics programs there are corner radius values that are cornerRadiusX and cornerRadiusY. I have even seen topLeftRadiusX and topLeftRadiusY. </p>  <p>For example there is this FXG / SVG code,</p>  <pre><code>    &lt;s:Rect id="lowlight" left="1" right="1" top="1" bottom="1" topLeftRadiusX="4" topRightRadiusX="4"&gt;     &lt;/s:Rect&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I've never seen topLeftRadiusX and topLeftRadiusY used together but then again I've never seen them used very much at all. </p>  <p>What are they for and how do they affect the graphic?</p>
