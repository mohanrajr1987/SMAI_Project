<p>I have a Meteor-Angular app that connects with an API (Jira). I also have a directive which draws an SVG. This directive takes some values as parameters. The values are provided by a call to the API. There's the problem : the call to the API isn't completed yet, before the SVG is drawn. So the directive gets no values.</p>  <p>Here's the directive in the html view :</p>  <pre><code>                &lt;circlesvg                        percentages="project.percentages"                        total="project.total"                        colors="['#d667cd','#3D8C1E','#00b9ff']"                        lineair="['#FF5DF4','#69F233', '#0080B0']"                        size="80"&gt;             &lt;/circlesvg&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I first need to call the API to get all the issues, and then check my server database for info on the issues.  This is the function the controller uses :</p>  <pre><code>            Meteor.call('getIssuesForSprint', projectKey, sprintId, function(error,result){             if(error){                 alert(error);             }             else {                 issues = result;                 statistics = getStatus(issues);//check database                 //irrelevant code to find the percentages                 self.percentages = [self.toDo_p, self.toDo_p,  self.toDo_p]; //these values are what the directive gets                  $scope.$apply();             }             }); </code></pre>  <p>I have used the $scope.$apply() to restart the angular digest cycle, but I've read that won't work for a directive.</p>  <p>I have tried some $watch and $observe ideas but they either don't work or I apply them wrong.</p>  <p>I have also read all the stackoverflow related questions, but they are not clear to me.</p>
