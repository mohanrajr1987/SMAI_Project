<p>I am trying to draw clusters for which I am using different arrays as dataset in the data(FirstArray) method of d3.js. It works fine for the first array. However when the second array comes for the purpose of drawing the second cluster of circles, it will not  update or set data(secondArray).</p>  <p>var vis = d3.selectAll("circle").data(nArr); // here can I modify nArr dataset to new dataset. while I also want cluster of circles against previous nArr dataset remain on svg. Simply I want to modify the nArr dataset to new dataset in order to create 2nd cluster of circles remain on the same svg .</p>  <p>After drawing  one cluster of circles for the first data array, then when new data in an array comes for clearing second cluster of circles, it doesnt work. e.g in above statement data(nArr) nArr is not changing the second time. While I want the first cluster to also remain on svg. Can anyone help me out?</p>
