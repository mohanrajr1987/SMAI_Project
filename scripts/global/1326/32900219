<p>I am finishing off a bitmap to SVG javascript library but I have a few questions that I can not find information on.</p>  <p><strong>SVG semantics.</strong></p>  <p>There are two svg tags <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;desc&gt;</code>. Are these examined by search engine bots? If so do they have equal merit? Should the title hold semantic meaning or is the title just a name?</p>  <p>For example a image of some broken eggs that I have titled (personally) "Uncounted" so I could annotate it like</p>  <ul> <li>Filename "uncounted.svg" this is the same for all</li> <li>Title "Uncounted"</li> <li>Desc "Some broken eggs."</li> </ul>  <p>Or</p>  <ul> <li>Title "Some broken eggs."</li> <li>Desc "A vector drawing of some broken eggs named Uncounted by Blindman67"</li> </ul>  <p>I would also like to add a URL and copyright info. Where does that go? There is a <code>&lt;metadata&gt;</code> but that will not help if it is not read by search engine bots. How do I ensure google will read the copyright.</p>  <p>Also is there a place for product promotion. Ie "Image vectorised by Groover, site address, and how groovy Groover is"</p>  <p><strong>Structure.</strong></p>  <p>Which is better for the widest use. If I have a shape with shapes inside should I overlap the smaller shapes over the larger, or should I ensure that shapes do not overlap and avoid any overlapping elements?</p>  <p><strong>Colour.</strong></p>  <p>Is there a SVG safe colour set that can ensure consistency from authorship to viewing and printing. I have an option for Print safe colours but that just filters hex colours. Will this be mangled by print drivers? </p>  <p><strong>And finally.</strong></p>  <p>Are there any major don't when it comes to SVG for general public consumption?</p>
