<p>I am looking to display the NULL values as blank spaces or dashes to make the resulting data set easier to read as the date range can vary. For example, for a date range of 10 days I could receive NULL values for 5 out of the 10 days for a person's hours. I just want those NULL values to be blank if a person has no hours for that day.  </p>  <p>I have seen examples of ISNULL being used on pivot tables, but not a dynamic pivot table. I'm wondering how to specify the NULL replacement for my dynamic list of dates filled into @PivotColumns. </p>  <p>In my query example below, I have omitted non-relevant code such as joins and other informational columns, etc.</p>  <pre><code>SELECT  @PivotColumns = COALESCE(@PivotColumns + ',','') + QUOTENAME(CONVERT(varchar(20),eff_date,110)) FROM (SELECT DISTINCT      eff_date FROM      timept WHERE      eff_date         BETWEEN     @StartDate AND @EndDate) AS TimePivot ORDER BY eff_date  SET @TimeQuery =     'WITH Hours AS (         SELECT              ,tp.person_id             ,tp.hours             ,tp.task_code             ,tp.eff_date             ,SUM(tp.hours) OVER(PARTITION BY tp.person_id, edr.name, tp.task_code, tp.comments ORDER BY tp.task_code) AS sum_hours         FROM             tables         WHERE             tp.eff_date BETWEEN ''' + @StartDate + ''' AND ''' + @EndDate + '''             )         SELECT             *         FROM             Hours             PIVOT                 (SUM(hours)                     FOR                  eff_date                     IN                  ('+@PivotColumns+')) as p'  EXEC sp_executesql @TimeQuery </code></pre>
