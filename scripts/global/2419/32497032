<p>Devexpress XtraPivotGrid loads data from database. </p>  <p>There are 2 columns, productname and _productnameorder(invisible), so when the sorting of productname is to be done, it should be based on _productnameorder column.</p>  <p>The approach I believe would be useful is to write custom sort algorithm in customsortevent.</p>  <p>Is there any other way I could achieve this?</p>  <p>Thanks in advnace.</p>
