<p>I have created a function with <code>PIVOT</code> that turns the string into table which is the output I want. What I want is I don't need to declare the columns one by one.</p>  <p>Here's the code:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT  Name1, Name2, Name3 FROM (   SELECT    LEFT(CA.val,CHARINDEX('=',CA.val)-1) ColumnName,   SUBSTRING(CA.val,CHARINDEX('=',CA.val)+1,100) Value   FROM Z_SampleTable   CROSS APPLY dbo.SplitSample(ProcessBody,'|') CA ) PD PIVOT (   MAX(Value)   FOR ColumnName IN (Name1, Name2, Name3) )  AS PT </code></pre>  <p>Is there a way that doesn't need to declare each column? For example, I have a table that contains 100 columns, is there a way not to declare those 100 columns?</p>
