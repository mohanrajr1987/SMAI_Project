<p>I have data in an excel pivot that looks like the following:</p>  <p>Cat1                    37  28  189</p>  <p>Cat2                201 2   1866</p>  <p>Cat3                79  29  317</p>  <p>This data comes from a larger data set that includes items not found in the result sets. I'm trying to build a report that will allow the user to double-click the "2" and only get a "show details" result of those 2 specific data rows. Cat 1, cat 2, and cat 3 all belong to a larger filtered field, which is also part of a larger filtered field, and I need the expand/collapse functionality. </p>  <p>We thought about doing this in R but the programming time is prohibitive. </p>  <p>I know Excel Pivots can't be set to just pull the two data lines, as they only look at Row ID for "Show Details". I've thought about event-overrides in VBA but ruled them out as too clunky. How would you get the expand/collapse and aggregation of a pivot table with the lowest-level data source display in a system that would allow for 2-3 days of development?</p>  <p>(We've thought about breaking out our data sources into multiple to handle this, but that's the least "pretty" option for this.)</p>  <p>Thanks all.</p>
