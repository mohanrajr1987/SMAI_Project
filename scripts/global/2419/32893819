<p>I am using SQL Server 2012 and I am running the following T-SQL pivot query:</p>  <pre><code>USE MyDatabase  SELECT PropertyCode, ISNULL([AUGUST 2015],0) AS 'August 2015' FROM (  SELECT [PropertyCode], [MTH], [Package Revenue Excl VAT]   FROM [RSDLIST]) m   PIVOT (SUM([Package Revenue Excl VAT]) FOR [MTH] IN   ([AUGUST 2015]   )) AS PVTTABLE </code></pre>  <p>An extract of my output is shown below:</p>  <pre><code> PropertyCode   August 2015     Smith        15071923.019032     Jones            2152483.164654     Steeve           7136836.891117 </code></pre>  <p>I need to format the second column so that the output becomes:</p>  <pre><code>     PropertyCode     August 2015         Smith         15,071,923         Jones     2,152,483         Steeve    7,136,836 </code></pre>  <p>I've had a look at the answers provided here : <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13207075/format-a-number-with-commas-but-without-decimals-in-sql-server-2008-r2">Format a number with commas but without decimals in SQL Server 2008 R2</a></p>  <p>and this one from Microsoft: <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh213505.aspx" rel="nofollow">Format (T-SQL)</a></p>  <p>I've tried the first one by replacing [Package Revenue Excl VAT] at line 3 with the following:      <code>CONVERT(varchar,CAST(a.[Package Revenue Excl VAT] AS MONEY),1) AS 'Pkg Rev'</code></p>  <p>However, since the values have been converted into a varchar, they can't be used in the Pivot query!</p>
