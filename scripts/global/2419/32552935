<p>I am having a problem with getting the correct layout for multiple multivalue columns - I want them arranged next to each other rather than Excel's offered 'magic'. </p>  <p>Here my source table:</p>  <pre> title   x   y name    A   B name    B   B name1   A   A name1   B   A name    B   A </pre>  <p>Desired output:<pre>         x       y<br> title   A   B   A   B name    1   2   1   2 name1   1   1   2   0 </pre></p>  <p>Any excel wizard knows how to accomplish it?</p>
