<p>I have a query running in MS Access which displays employees in the first column and then pivots the status of their training tasks in the remaining columns. Statuses are simply given as completed, not required or required as shown below:</p>  <pre><code>Employee Computer Business Communication ========================================= samiro05    C        NR         R bobmarley   NR       NR         C einstein    NR       R          R </code></pre>  <p>With this query I can run a report and change the design to be better looking and conditionally formatted to highlight areas where training is required (R). If I add more people to the source tables along with their training I can press refresh on the report and it will add a new line for the employee name just as the crosstab query now has a new row for the new employee's training. However, if I add a new training task, say Science, and update the employees' training to include Science then my crosstab query looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>Employee Computer Business Communication Science ================================================= samiro05    C        NR         R           C bobmarley   NR       NR         C           NR einstein    NR       R          R           C sheldon     C        C          R           C </code></pre>  <p>...but my report when refreshed looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>Employee Computer Business Communication ========================================= samiro05    C        NR         R bobmarley   NR       NR         C einstein    NR       R          R sheldon     C        C          R </code></pre>  <p>Is there a way to get the columns of my crosstab query to change within my report as my crosstab query columns increase/decrease just by refreshing the report rather than having to create the whole report again each time I add a new training/each time a new column is added or taken away from my crosstab query?</p>  <p>Many thanks for any help you can give with this. I will add my thoughts on how to solve this in the comments below.</p>
