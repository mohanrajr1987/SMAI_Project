<p>I am using powerpivot to create some metrics. On one pivot table, I want to show hires, terms and actives and then turnover % for each month.  </p>  <p>I have the Hires, Terms &amp; Actives powerpivot data working, however I do not know how I can add the turnover calculation. </p>  <p>Is there a way to insert a new column to a pivot table and run a simple division calculation in it?</p>  <p>*tried posting image of my data, not sure why site will not post imagae for me</p>  <p>one line of of table would look like such</p>  <p>Division | Hires | Actives | Terms | Turnover</p>  <p>Corporate | 5    |  150    | 3     | (terms/actives)</p>
