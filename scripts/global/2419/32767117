<p>Let's say I have a table like this:</p>  <pre><code>Country Region  Mytext USA     North   a USA     South   b Brasil  North   c Brasil  South   d </code></pre>  <p>How can I obtain a pivot like this in Excel?</p>  <pre><code>Country  North         South USA      a             b Brasil   c             d </code></pre>  <p>If 'mytext' were a number, I could do a pivot table: since there is only one row per combination of country and region, min = max = sum = avg and any of these aggregate functions would, in fact, show me the result I want.</p>  <p>But what when the field I want is non-numeric? With Python's pandas library, I can use the dataframe.pivot() method even on non-numerical fields, but I haven't found a way to do the same in Excel. I could associate a number to each row, do the pivot in Excel to show that number, and then do a lookup to get the associated text, but it seems a rather convoluted process for something which should really be easier!</p>
