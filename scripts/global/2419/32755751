<p>There is no problem for me to pivot statistic columns in my query e.g Column 1 , Column 2 , Column 3.... and so on.</p>  <p>But i would like to do this dynamic instead.</p>  <p>My data looks like this:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/rQ3cu.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/rQ3cu.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>i want to be able to EXECUTE a store procedure to get the output result: <strong>Exec sp_output 1</strong> (from another window where '1' represents the PoolID (@AppPool)) to look like this:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/JMbDZ.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/JMbDZ.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>This is my SP:</p>  <pre><code>create PROCEDURE [dbo].[sp_test] @Query as nvarchar(100) -- OUTPUT?,  @AppPool AS nvarchar(50)  AS  SELECT @Query = Attribute  FROM [dbo].[Vy_UserAccess] WHERE PoolID = @AppPool  SELECT [Users],'+ @Query +' FROM (SELECT [Pool],[Users],[RecNum],[Attribute],[Values] FROM [dbo].[Vy_UserAccess] ) AS  T1 PIVOT (MAX([Values]) FOR [ATTRIBUTE] IN ('+ @Query +')) AS T2 </code></pre>  <p>Is this possible to achieve by just fine tuning my code or do i have to go on another direction? <em>im using mssql 2012 r2</em></p>
