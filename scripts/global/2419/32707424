<p>I'm fairly new to SQL so please forgive this.</p>  <p>I have a table like this:</p>  <pre><code>+---------+-------+-----+-----+-----+ | Vehicle |  Kms  |  6  | 12  | 18  | +---------+-------+-----------+-----+ |  Car    | 30000 | 53% | 50% | 47% | |  Car    | 40000 | 50% | 47% | 44% | |  Bus    | 50000 | 47% | 44% | 42% | +---------+-------+-----------+-----+ </code></pre>  <p>The number in the header row are actually years, and I want to aggregate them into an 'Age' column like so.</p>  <pre><code>+---------+-------+-----+------------+ | Vehicle |  Kms  | Age | Percentage | ------------------------+------------+ |  Car    | 30000 | 6   |   53%      | |  Car    | 30000 | 12  |   50%      | |  Car    | 30000 | 12  |   47%      | |  Car    | 40000 | 6   |   50%      | +---------+-------+-----+------------+ </code></pre>  <p>I've looked into using PIVOT but I don't want to aggregate the Kms column. Any idea how I can achieve this?</p>
