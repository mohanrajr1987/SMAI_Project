<p>I have a Pandas DataFrame that looks like this (currently without an index other than the in-built row index, but if it's easier to add indexes to "Person" and "Car", that's fine too):</p>  <pre><code>before = pd.DataFrame({   'Email': ['john@example.com','mary@example.com','jane@example.com','john@example.com','mary@example.com'],   'Person': ['John','Mary','Jane','John','Mary'],   'Car': ['Ford','Toyota','Nissan','Nissan','Ford'] }) </code></pre>  <p>I'd like to re-shape it to look like this:</p>  <pre><code>after = pd.DataFrame({   'Person': ['John','Mary','Jane'],   'Email': ['john@example.com','mary@example.com','jane@example.com'],   'Ford': [True,True,False],   'Nissan': [True,False,True],   'Toyota': [False,True,False] }) </code></pre>  <p>Note that John has owned both a Ford and a Nissan, Mary has owned a Ford and a Toyota, and Paul has stuck with his trusty Nissan.</p>  <p>I've tried various permutations of stacking a multi-indexed DataFrame, grouping, pivoting -- I can't seem to figure out how to take the value from the "Car" column and transpose it to a new column with the value "True", merging people together by, say, their name.</p>
