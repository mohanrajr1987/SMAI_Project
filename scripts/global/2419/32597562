<p>I'm having a difficult time with our MySql query. We need a table that displays a list of clients, and their monthly fee for our services. Changes to the fee is stored in a table which looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>id     clientId     fee      monthChanged 1      15           399      2015-02 2      15           499      2015-03 3      9            399      2015-03 4      15           399      2015-04 </code></pre>  <p>I want the results to be displayed like this:</p>  <pre><code>clientId     01/2015     02/2015     03/2015     04/2015     05/2015 9            0           0           399         399         399 15           0           399         499         399         399 </code></pre>  <p>I also need the table to display the results between two given dates (f.i. from 2015-01 to 2015-11)</p>  <p>Any help with this would be really really great.</p>
