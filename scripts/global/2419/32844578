<p>I have looked hard for an answer to something I have been doing regularly in excel but am struggling with as I start in qlikview</p>  <p>I want to pivot my data* to show a couple of dimensions (say location, complexity and client name) and to classify the number of accounts per location/client into buckets such as "High", "Medium", "Low", as well as $ cost</p>  <p>I can create the expression to do this but I can't then use this expression in subsequent calculations, or drag JUST the calculated categories to the top of the pivot chart</p>  <p>*so data looks like (this is meant to look like a table 0 first post so apologies if it doesn't)</p>  <h2>Location     Client      Complexity  $Cost</h2>  <p>London       Client1     Simple        5 London       Client1     Complex       5 London       Client2     Simple        5 London       Client2     Complex       5 London       Client2     Semi          5 London       Client3     Simple        5 London       Client3     Complex       5 London       Client3     Semi          5 Brighton       Client4     Simple        5 Brighton       Client4     Complex       5</p>  <p>etc</p>  <p>and pivot looks like</p>  <pre><code>                      # Complexities      $cost        CalculatedExpression </code></pre>  <p>London    client 1              2               10             Medium (ie 1-2)           client 2              3               10             High    (ie 3-5) etc</p>  <p>Now I want to be able to use that Calculated expression in other tables as a dimension</p>  <p>As I say I do it constantly in excel but have yet to figure out any way in qlikview</p>
