<p>I hope someone can help, I have a database of different odds (betting odds) which are linked to a unique eventID. All of the odds are stored as a row in the MySQL database as per the below description.</p>  <pre><code>ID | EventID | BookmakerName | BoommakerURL | BookmakerHome | BookmakerDraw | BookmakerAway  12345 | 111213 | Bookmaker | http://wwww.URL.com | 1.3 | 1.6 | 1.5 &lt;p&gt; 12345 | 111213 | Bookmaker2 | http://wwww.URL2.com | 2.3 | 2.6 | 2.5 </code></pre>  <p>What i'm looking to do though is to display these in columns as per the below example. I'll be doing a INNER Join on get the team name from another table.</p>  <pre><code>EventID | Team | Bookmaker | Bookmaker2 &lt;p&gt; 111213 | HomeTeam | 1.3 | 2.3&lt;p&gt; 111213 | AwayTeam | 1.6 | 2.6&lt;p&gt; 111213 | Draw | 1.5 | 2.5&lt;p&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I'm using PHP and managed to loop through the results and display the rows but I'm struggling to change the layout. </p>  <p>Any help would be appreciated as I'm stuck. Happy any MySQL solutions e.g. create a new table or PHP based solutions.</p>
