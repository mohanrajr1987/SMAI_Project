<p>I have a table called MY_MOVIES with two columns: MOVIES and GENRES like this (the relationship is one movie to many genres):</p>  <pre><code>GENRE         MOVIE ----------    --------------            ACTION        MOVIE1 DRAMA         MOVIE1 CRIME         MOVIE2 DRAMA         MOVIE2 CRIME         MOVIE3 DRAMA         MOVIE3 ACTION        MOVIE4 ADVENTURE     MOVIE4 FANTASY       MOVIE4 ANIMATION     MOVIE5 ADVENTURE     MOVIE5 COMEDY        MOVIE5 </code></pre>  <p>This table have more than 100000 rows.</p>  <p>I'm trying to get an output like this:</p>  <pre><code>MOVIES        GENRES ----------    --------------  MOVIE1        ACTION, DRAMA MOVIE2        CRIME, DRAMA MOVIE3        CRIME, DRAMA MOVIE4        ACTION, ADVENTURE, FANTASY MOVIE5        ANIMATION, ADVENTURE, COMEDY </code></pre>  <p>I was trying with PIVOT like this (having the idea of replace 0 and 1 to genres later):</p>  <pre><code>SELECT * FROM MY_MOVIES  PIVOT (COUNT(MOVIE) FOR GENRE in (SELECT DISTINCT(GENRE) FROM MY_MOVIES) as MOVIE_GENRES </code></pre>  <p>I have been thinking I'm doing it the wrong way.</p>
