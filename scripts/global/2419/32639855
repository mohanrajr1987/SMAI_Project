<p>I have a table which store 1 row per 1 survey.<br> Each survey got about 70 questions, each column present 1 question</p>  <pre><code>SurveyID  Q1, Q2   Q3   ..... 1         Yes Good Bad  ...... </code></pre>  <p>I want to pivot this so it reads</p>  <pre><code>SurveyID Question  Answer 1        Q1        Yes 1        Q2        Good 1        Q3        Bad ...      ...       ..... </code></pre>  <p>I use {cross apply} to acheive this</p>  <pre><code>   SELECT t.[SurveyID]   , x.question   , x.Answer   FROM tbl t   CROSS APPLY    (     select 1 as QuestionNumber, 'Q1' as Question , t.Q1 As Answer union all     select 2 as QuestionNumber, 'Q2' as Question , t.Q2 As Answer union all     select 3 as QuestionNumber, 'Q3' as Question , t.Q3 As Answer) x </code></pre>  <p>This works but I dont want to do this 70 times so I have this select statement</p>  <pre><code>    select ORDINAL_POSITION     , COLUMN_NAME from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS WHERE TABLE_NAME = mytable </code></pre>  <p>This gives me the list of column and position of column in the table. So I hope I can somehow join 2nd statement with the 1st statement where by column name. However I am comparing content within a column and a column header here. Is it doable? Is there other way of achieving this? </p>  <p>Hope you can guide me please?</p>  <p>Thank you</p>
