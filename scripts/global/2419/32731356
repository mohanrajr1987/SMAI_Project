<p>Here is my current query on pivot</p>  <pre><code>SELECT CORNo, [0001], [0002], [0003] FROM      (         Select InvoiceNo, CORNo as CORNo, Amount         from InvoiceItems II          left join Invoices I on I.InvoiceID = II.InvoiceID          left join CORProjects CPI on CPI.CORProjectID = II.ReferenceID and CPI.ProjectID = I.ProjectID         LEFT JOIN Projects P ON P.ProjectID = CPI.ProjectID         where II.ReferenceID = CPI.CORProjectID and I.InvoiceType = 2         and P.ProjectID = 913      ) AS t1  PIVOT  (     MAX(Amount)      FOR InvoiceNo IN ( [0001], [0002], [0003])  ) AS t2 </code></pre>  <p>What i want to do is not to use the dynamic column <strong>( [0001], [0002], [0003])</strong> and use select query in "IN" clause.</p>  <pre><code>SELECT CORNo, select distinct(InvoiceNo) from Invoices where ProjectID = 913 FROM      (         Select InvoiceNo, CORNo as CORNo, Amount         from InvoiceItems II          left join Invoices I on I.InvoiceID = II.InvoiceID          left join CORProjects CPI on CPI.CORProjectID = II.ReferenceID and CPI.ProjectID = I.ProjectID         LEFT JOIN Projects P ON P.ProjectID = CPI.ProjectID         where II.ReferenceID = CPI.CORProjectID and I.InvoiceType = 2         and P.ProjectID = 913      ) AS t1  PIVOT  (     MAX(Amount)      FOR InvoiceNo IN (select distinct(InvoiceNo) from Invoices where ProjectID = 913)  ) AS t2 </code></pre>  <p>when I try to use select query. I encounter an error. Is select statement possible on PIVOT? Thanks. </p>
