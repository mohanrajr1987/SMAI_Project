<p>This is my query:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT *  FROM  (     SELECT (DATENAME(mm, Date)+ ',' + DATENAME(yy, Date)) AS Month_Year,           SUM(Price) AS Sum,        Name      FROM      (          SELECT Name, Price, Date          FROM CashHeading          JOIN Customer              ON CashHeading.Id_Customer = Customer.Id          JOIN Cash              ON CashHeading.Id = Cash.Id_cashheading          JOIN Good              ON Cash.Id_Good = Good.Id          WHERE Date &lt; '01.01.2016' AND Date &gt; '01.01.2015'      ) AS NewTable      GROUP BY (DATENAME(mm, Date)+ ',' + DATENAME(yy, Date)), Name ) AS NewestTable  PIVOT (MAX(Sum) FOR Month_Year IN (SELECT DISTINCT Month_Year FROM NewestTable)) AS pvt </code></pre>  <p>But this called exception:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException Incorrect syntax near the keyword   'SELECT'.
