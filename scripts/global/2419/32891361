<p>I have a client that inherited an Excel spreadsheet full of contact information for a mailing list. Apparently, his predecessor attempted to format the spreadsheet for printing pin-feed mailing labels. It uses one column, and has the address info in separate rows:</p>  <pre><code>Name Street Address City, ST ZIP Name Street Address City, ST ZIP Name Street Address City, ST ZIP </code></pre>  <p>What I need to do is transpose the data into columns, with separate columns for City, ST, and ZIP (for carrier route sorting). My initial thought was to use Pivot, but I couldn't seem to get that to work.</p>  <p>There are 1,800+ names in this mailing list, so manually fixing it is not an option. I also had an idea to export them as a CSV, and then use a series of find and replace operations to replace line breaks with commas, but that seems bush league. There has to be a proper data solution.</p>  <p>Ideas?</p>  <p>Thanks,</p>  <p>ty</p>
