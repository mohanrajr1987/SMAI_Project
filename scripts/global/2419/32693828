<p>I have a PivotTable in Excel (but no access to the raw data) which I would like to export so I can analyse it further. The easiest solution would be to have access to the raw data that is used to create the PivotTable, but in my case this is not possible as customised software is pulling the data from a database to which I have no access. I only have the Excel PivotTable and I need to export it somehow. </p>  <p>Is there a way to directly export the Excel PivotTable to XML?</p>
