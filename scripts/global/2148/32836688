<p>I am trying to execute the following query on two different databases with difent collations</p>  <pre><code>select * from sourcedb.DBO.PKtable  except  select * from destinationdb.DBO.PKtable </code></pre>  <p>It is clear that both the tables have the same columns and the primary key</p>  <p>But when executing, encountered the following exception</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Msg 468, Level 16, State 9, Line 17<br>   Cannot resolve the collation conflict between "SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS" and "Latin1_General_CS_AS" in the EXCEPT operation.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I cannot use <code>COLLATE</code> keyword because.. I will be using the above query at runtime and the table name and columns vary, hence cannot predict the columns of the table.</p>  <p>I have tried to change the collation of the destination database to same as the source database using the following command</p>  <pre><code>ALTER DATABASE destinationDB SET SINGLE_USER WITH ROLLBACK IMMEDIATE  ALTER DATABASE destinationDB COLLATE &lt;&lt;sourceCollation&gt;&gt;; ALTER DATABASE destinationDB SET MULTI_USER </code></pre>  <p>The collation is set to the database and I can see it from the <code>sys</code> tables.</p>  <p>Even then when I execute the query mentioned above, getting the same error</p>  <p>EDIT1: Basically I'm trying to get the records which have the same primary key but difference in the row.</p>
