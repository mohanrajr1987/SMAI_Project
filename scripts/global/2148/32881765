<p>This is probably a very very basic issue but I'm a beginner with Oracle. I'm running a simple query, which works fine and returns results, but when adding a <code>*</code> to the list of columns displayed, I get the below error:</p>  <pre><code>ORA-00936: missing expression 00936. 00000 -  "missing expression" *Cause:     *Action: Error at Line: 4 Column: 7 </code></pre>  <p>The query I'm running is:</p>  <pre><code>select     sql_plan_hash_value col1     , elapsed_seconds col2     , * from     (select *     from SYS.V_$SESSION_LONGOPS     order by elapsed_seconds desc) result_set where rownum &lt;= 10; </code></pre>  <p>I thought that it's because I'm not giving aliases to my first two columns, so I did, but the query is still not working.</p>
