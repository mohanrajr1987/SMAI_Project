<p>I think I have a simple problem here, but I spend my "recomended 30 minutes" trying to resolve this, but with no success. :)</p>  <p>I have a first procedure like this</p>  <pre><code>procedure p1(a in varchar2) is  begin  -- call second procedure p2(a); -- other things end; </code></pre>  <p>My second procedure may have an exception to raise:</p>  <pre><code>procedure p2(a in varchar2) is lv varchar2(20); begin    select '1' into lv from dual;    if lv = '2' then           raise general_exception; end if; end; </code></pre>  <p>My <code>general_exception</code> variable is a global exceptions type, inside the package where both of my procedures are in.</p>  <p>What I want is to catch the exception in the first procedure (<code>p1</code>) to avoid the execution of the other things.</p>  <p>I've tried this but with no results:</p>  <pre><code> procedure p1(a in varchar2)     is      begin      -- call second procedure     p2(a);     -- other things exception when general_exception then   dbms_output.put_line('ERROR'); end; </code></pre>
