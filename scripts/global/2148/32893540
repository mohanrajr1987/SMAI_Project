<p>I've got a base class and another class which inherits from it. Something like the following</p>  <pre><code>create or replace type object_base as object (     number id,     member procedure UpdateTable ) not final / create or replace type body object_base is     member procedure UpdateTable is     begin         null;     end; end; / create or replace type my_object under object_base (     overriding member procedure UpdateTable ) / create table my_table of my_object; / create or replace type body my_object is     overriding member procedure UpdateTable is     begin         update my_table set row = self where id = self.id;     end; end; </code></pre>  <p>I get the error "ORA-00904 Invalid Identifier" on the line </p>  <pre><code>update my_table set row = self where id = self.id; </code></pre>  <p>seemingly due to that it recognizes self as object_base rather than my_object. I can't seem to resolve this by using treat(self as my_object). Any solutions?</p>
