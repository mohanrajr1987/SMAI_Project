<p>I would like to know if it is possible to achieve the steps below in PL / SQL. </p>  <p>Please note that I use the word "partition" when I mean "put rows with a certain condition together" because a) I would like to avoid the word "group" because it combines rows in SQL, b) my research so far led me to think that the "PARTITION BY" clause is possibly what I want:</p>  <pre><code>1. Select rows based on a long query with many joins,  partition the results based on a certain column value of type LONG.  2. Loop through each row of a partition and partition again,  based on another column of type VARCHAR.  Do that for every partition.   3. Loop through each row of the resulting sub-partition, compare multiple columns  with predefined values, set a boolean column to true or false based on the result.  Do that for every sub-partition. </code></pre>  <p>It would be really easy to do for me in a normal programming language, such as Java. But can I do that in PL/SQL? If so, what would be a good approach? Thank you for your help!</p>
