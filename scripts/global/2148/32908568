<p>I have some PL/SQL code that is <em>intended</em> to loop through the entire month range for each month in each year, and then retrieve the number of times <em>something</em> occurred within a monthly period.</p>  <p>Right now, I'm not doing a nested loop for each year that exists because I need to properly understand how this works before continuing. </p>  <p>Here's my code:</p>  <pre><code>BEGIN    FOR i IN 1..11 LOOP         BEGIN             SELECT COUNT(UNIQUE EMPLOYEE) as Emp FROM (SELECT DATE_COL, EMPLOYEE                 FROM CORE.DATE_TEST              WHERE DATE_COL  &gt;= TO_DATE(i || '/1/2015 00:00:00', 'MM/DD/YYYY HH24:MI:SS')                 AND DATE_COL  &lt; TO_DATE((i + 1) || '/1/2015 23:59:59', 'MM/DD/YYYY HH24:MI:SS')             ORDER BY DATE_COL ASC);         END;    END LOOP;    COMMIT; END; </code></pre>  <p>And I'm getting this error: <code>PLS-00428: an INTO clause is expected in this SELECT statement</code></p>  <p>Obviously, I need to select the results into <em>something</em>, but what that something is, I'm not quite sure. This may not even be the right way to do it. </p>  <p>However, I'd like to take all of these results, and combine them into a single table like this:</p>  <pre><code>+----------+-------+ |   date   | count | +----------+-------+ | January  |  200  | +----------+-------| | February |  100  | +----------+-------| | March    |  500  | +----------+-------| </code></pre>  <p>And so on.</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong>: There are no priviledges to create a <code>TABLE</code>, or even a <code>GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE</code>. This needs to be done without temporary tables.</p>
