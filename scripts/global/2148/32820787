<p>all the time I log into SQL Developer it is asking me for my password. I know the opportunity to save the password and that I log in automatically. But my idea was to save the password in a excel file and to type in a comment in the password line or anywhere else so that the SQLDevloper/Oracle takes the password automatically from there.</p>  <p>Is this possible?</p>  <p>PS: I log in SQL Developer normal and use Excel actually only to import and to export data from my tables.</p>
