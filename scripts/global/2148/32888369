<p>i am trying to implement sequence number in multiple tables. I have requirement to implement it by writting a procedure in plsql and call the sequence from this plsql procedure. Suppose, i have 4 tables. Each table contains a column named as if_row_id. i have generate sequence numbers for each row in each table during the insertion of data into tables in if_row_id column.And the entire thing should be completed by writing one sequence and one plsql procedure for 4 tables.</p>
