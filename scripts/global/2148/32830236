<p>You might not believe it but I searched the questions on stackoverflow to find an answer for the following question:</p>  <p>I can compile this function</p>  <pre><code>create or replace function cart_distance(x1 in number,x2 in number,y1 in number,y2 in number) return number is begin    return sqrt((x2-x1)*(x2-x1) + (y2-y1)*(y2-y1)); end; </code></pre>  <p>But if I want to test it the compiler gives the following error "Encountered the symbol SELECT"</p>  <pre><code>SELECT cart_distance(2,3,4,5) FROM DUAL; </code></pre>  <p>The function and the query are written in the SQL worksheet and I press the "Run statement" option. (I'm very unexperienced with the program)</p>
