<p>I'd like to run a function that will select a ref into an attribute from an object table, and if the table returns null then the attribute is set to null. To achieve this I tried the code.</p>  <pre><code>select ref(t) into self_ref from my_table where objectID = self.objectID; </code></pre>  <p>But this fails anytime that the where fails to find a match. In place I have the following</p>  <pre><code>select count(*)     into l_result     from my_table  where companyID = self.companyID; if l_result &gt; 0 then     select ref(t)         into self_ref         from my_table t      where objectID = self.objectID; else     self_ref := null; end if; </code></pre>  <p>But I'd like if there was a better solution that didn't involve so much redundancy.</p>  <p>Any suggestions?</p>
