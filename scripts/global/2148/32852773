<p>This is my code:</p>  <pre><code>--this section creates/replaces the C_PND Procedure  --and passes 2variables     create or replace PROCEDURE    C_PND    (     p_whse in varchar2,     p_RC OUT INT    ) --No clue what we're doing here as there is no DECLARE as  cv SYS_REFCURSOR;  -- cursor variable  v_pull_zone locn_hdr.pull_zone%TYPE;  v_active varchar2(1);  v_low_wm number(3);  v_high_wm number(3);  v_lock_code resv_locn_hdr.locn_putaway_lock%TYPE;  --initializes this variable BEGIN p_RC := 0; --setting values of the the CV OPEN cv FOR select code_id,      nvl(trim(substr(sc.misc_flags,1,1)),'N') v_active,      nvl(trim(substr(sc.misc_flags,2,3)),'100') high_wm,      nvl(trim(substr(sc.misc_flags,5,3)),'0') low_wm,      trim(substr(sc.misc_flags,8,2)) lock_code from sys_code sc where sc.rec_type = 'C' and sc.code_type = 'PND'; --inputting the CV into these variables LOOP   FETCH cv INTO v_pull_zone, v_active, v_high_wm, v_low_wm, v_lock_code;    EXIT WHEN cv%NOTFOUND;   ............   ............   ............ </code></pre>  <p>I think I understand most of it but my problem comes in with the five lines after the as (lines 6-11 of code snippet).  I'm under the impression that anytime you use variables in PL SQL you have to DECLARE them.  Even if you are using cursor variables.  </p>  <p>Am I simply wrong about that? Or is there no need to DECLARE variables in use with CVs?  I also included some comments (prefaced by --) that show what I think what the SQL is doing.</p>
