<p>Im writing some ETL to get data out of a legacy Oracle db and into SQL Server db for Analysis services etc.</p>  <p>The legacy oracle database is storing several time columns as Number(4,2).</p>  <pre><code>9 = 09:00 1.2 = 01:20 11.53 = 11:53 </code></pre>  <p>Are there any built in functions that will convert this to a Time data type?  Has anyone come across this before?  How did you solve it?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
