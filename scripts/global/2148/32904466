<p>Looking to throw an error where the value i'm updating is a 'not null' value.</p>  <p>For example. In below table, say I wanted to update Paul's lastname with 'Jackson'. The SQL should throw an error to say that the value that is being updated is 'not null'.</p>  <blockquote>   <p><b>First Lastname</b><br> Paul Parkinson<br> Peter null<br> Turkey null</p> </blockquote>  <p>As a second part to this question, I'm actually looking to do this in the APEX Express Data Load Wizard. If anyone would know how to modify the update command to do this, it would be greatly appreciated</p>
