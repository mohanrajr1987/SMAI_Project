<p>I need to accomplish the following :</p>  <p>I have a table with multiple column (c1, c2, c3, c4 ... cn).</p>  <p>I want a query that would return multiple rows in the following fashion (r1 r2 .. rx are the rows in the original table) :</p>  <pre><code>r1c1 r1c2 r1c3 r1c4 r1c5 r1c6 ... r1cn-2 r1cn-1 r1cn  r2c1 r2c2 r2c3 r2c4 r2c5 r2c6 ... r2cn-2 r2cn-1 r2cn  ...  rxc1 rxc2 rxc3 rxc4 rxc5 rxc6 ... rxcn-2 rxn-1 rxcn </code></pre>  <p>I know I can use unions and repeat basically the same query n times, but I need to use that query in a web based reporting system that I have no control over and the query is to big for the maximum number of characters allowed in queries.</p>  <p>Any suggestions ?</p>  <p>Thank you !</p>  <p>EDIT : FYI I'm building a report in a report tool I can't change using a database I can't change. So using custom functions/procedures is not a solution. It has to be a PL-SQL query.</p>  <p>To be more specific, i need to have multiple rows from the original row, lets say row 1 is</p>  <pre><code>a b c d e f h i j </code></pre>  <p>and row 2 is</p>  <pre><code>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 </code></pre>  <p>then I would get the following table with 3 columns :</p>  <pre><code>a b c d e f  h i j 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 </code></pre>
