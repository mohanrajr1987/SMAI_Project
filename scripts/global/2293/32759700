<p>I started developing apps for Apple TV and I have this problem whit buttons. I have a screen where are several buttons on bottom of the screen and then there is one, which is in the middle (see screenshot to understand). The problem is that I can't get focused the middle button. Focus is only on bottom three buttons. The problem is obviously caused by the <strong>Y position</strong>, when I move the button on bottom of the screen, it gets focused.</p>  <p>Buttons are created in storyboard, there is no code in ViewController. Settings in storyboard for the middle button are equal with settings for bottom buttons. Do I have to handle this manually in code? Or is it even possible to get focus movement like this? I would appreciate any information, thanks.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Xpk5o.png" alt="1]"></p>  <p>I'm still developing in simulator.</p>
