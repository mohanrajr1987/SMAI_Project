<p>I think Apple's RAW processor is nice but honestly there are far better. Capture One Pro, Dxo Optics, Adobe Camera Raw, Nikon Capture NX2 - they all create a much more pleasing output image.</p>  <p>I'm thinking about the possibilities of Apple's Photos Extensions introduced in OS X El Capitan, but I have yet to see any documentation that says if an extension can get access to the actual RAW data. PHAssetMediaType and PHAssetMediaSubType do not have an enum for a RAW image, only JPEG, Video etc..</p>  <p>If Photos can provide the actual RAW bits to a Photos Extension, this opens up the door to become the perfect DAM (along with iCloud Photos Library).</p>  <p>Just to be clear - I am fully aware that an extension can get a translated RAW file as input, the question is does Apple Photos first convert that RAW file into JPEG and provide the JPEG as input, or can Apple Photos send the actual RAW bits as input.</p>
