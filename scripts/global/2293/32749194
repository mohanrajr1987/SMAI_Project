<p>Where are the differences between the CBUUID and the NSUUID object?</p>  <p>I have seen to fill the scanForPeripheralsWithServices with both objects in different cases... Apple expect an CBUUID object so I would prefer to use this type or?</p>  <p>My example:</p>  <p><code>let MY_SERVICE_UUID = CBUUID(string: "hdl83h6sd-gl95-bn4f-37gd-jd73hd0tn8za") func scanForPeripheralsWithServices(serviceUUIDs: MY_SERVICE_UUID,nil)</code></p>
