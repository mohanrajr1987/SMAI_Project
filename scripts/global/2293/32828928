<p>I'm new with Swift 2, I never had developed in Apple. Objective C has seemed ugly and you have to write a lot of code, so Swift liked because the syntax is similar to Java and C and here my question:</p>  <p>In Java you can define a class of this way:</p>  <pre><code>new Thread(){   public run(){       // anything       } }.start(); </code></pre>  <p>Then, Swift can do this? And how?</p>  <p>Thank and greetings</p>
