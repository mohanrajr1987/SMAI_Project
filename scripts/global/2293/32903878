<p>Can anyone tell me how to set a specific release date in new iTunesConnect interface, after approval with pending developer release state?</p>  <p>Our release should for some reason at a weekend now, so changing from manually release to a date would be nice. But now where the app is in pending developer release state, I can not find the option for a specific release date anymore. </p>
