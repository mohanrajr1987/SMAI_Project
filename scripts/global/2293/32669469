<p>I'm making a tree, which has a root node and infinite levels.</p>  <p>What I want to achieve is:</p>  <ul> <li>Use a tableview to display the nodes of the current level, starting from the root node. Each table cell is a node. (I'm able to hard code it to display the nodes of a specific level.)</li> <li>When tapping a table cell, display the node's next level children in a tableview.</li> <li>This goes on and on, until you click a node which doesn't have any children. Then it just does nothing.</li> </ul>  <p>I know tapping a cell can trigger <em>performSegueWithIdentifier</em>, which goes to the next scene. But, since the tree has infinite levels, I guess merely going to another scene doesn't work. Instead, there must be a way to repeat the current scene (tableview to display current level nodes) with information about which level it is.</p>  <p>Please advise the best way to handle this situation. Thank you.</p>  <p>The sample tree structure is here: (</p>  <pre><code>class Node {   var id:Int;   var parent:Int?;   init(id:Int, parent:Int?) {     self.id = id;     self.parent = parent;   } }  var allNodes = [   Node(id:1, parent: nil),   Node(id:2, parent: 1),   Node(id:3, parent: 1),   Node(id:4, parent: 2),   Node(id:5, parent: 2),   Node(id:6, parent: 3) ]; </code></pre>
