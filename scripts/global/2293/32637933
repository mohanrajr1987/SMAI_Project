<p>I am trying to make an instagram like table view to show images. I am caching images in the cache directory too.</p>  <p>Everything is working great, But whenever i scroll quickly and then scroll back up real quick, I end up making two requests to download the same image in the cellForRowAtIndexPath() method . Is there any solid way to avoid duplicate requests?</p>  <p>I don't want to cancel request when the cell is dequeued (I know a  lot of people seem to do that). However i am looking for a way where i can make one request if the image is not in the cache directory. Please let me know how can i do something like this.</p>  <p>Here is my code which i am using to pull the image from the url. Please excuse the poor naming of the variable. I am still testing.</p>  <pre><code>dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(QOS_CLASS_USER_INITIATED, 0)){ [unowned self] in                    let imageData = NSData(contentsOfURL: imageurl!)                 let imagefromURL:UIImage = UIImage(data: imageData!)!                 let imageData1 = UIImageJPEGRepresentation(imagefromURL, 1)                  dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue()) { [unowned self] in                      imageData1.writeToFile(getImagePath, atomically: true)                     if let cellToUpdate = tableView.cellForRowAtIndexPath(indexPath) {                         cell.contentImage.image = imagefromURL                          cell.spinner.stopAnimating()                     }                 }                 } </code></pre>
