<p>In <a href="http://www.apple.com/watch/design/" rel="nofollow">apple watch site</a>:, you can see the section below when you scroll down a little bit:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/IweDB.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/IweDB.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>The watch in the left is not a static picture but an attractive animation actually. When I view the DOM element in the inspector of Chrome, I find it is a <code>canvas</code> element:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/baksp.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/baksp.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>When I check the downloaded files, I find images like this:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/qKd0C.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/qKd0C.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>This looks quite cryptic for me. What is the name of the technique apple used here which can generate animation on canvas from cluttered pictures? Is there any libraries for doing this?</p>
