<p>Last week before installing the new Xcode 7 I created an ipa version of my app and uploaded it, the users downloaded it and it run just fine. Now, after updating the Xcode to version 7, I'm uploading the new ipa and the users who download it can't install.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/yzXQs.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/yzXQs.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Does anyone knows what seems to be the problem?</p>
