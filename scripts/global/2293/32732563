<p>when we receive touches, that touches began on center of touch panel(x 960 y 540) even if we press on right bottom side of touch panel.</p>  <p>How we can take absolute press position on Remote touch panel - where top left point is 0 0, bottom right point is 1920 x 1080? Now i use this code, for receive touches</p>  <pre><code>- (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event {        for(UITouch *touch in touches) {             CGPoint p = [touch locationInView: view];             //....                   }   } </code></pre>
