<p>I'm trying to install OS X El Captain from the Mac store but the download rate is very slow. I've tried rebooting my computer. I've tried moving it closer to the router and I've tried to reboot the router too.</p>  <p>This isn't a connection problem because I tried googling the slow download rate for the mac store and narrowed the Google search to "Past year" and theres a bunch and a lot of people using up the whole first page of the google result complaining from about a week ago and making questions about how slow it is for them.</p>  <p><a href="http://developer.apple.com/devcenter/download.action?path=/Developer_Tools/Xcode_7.0.1/Xcode_7.0.1.dmg" rel="nofollow">http://developer.apple.com/devcenter/download.action?path=/Developer_Tools/Xcode_7.0.1/Xcode_7.0.1.dmg</a></p>  <p>Is there a certain link like this where I could directly download it like I did with Xcode 7.0.1?</p>  <p>Link source: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10335747/how-to-download-xcode-4-5-6-7-and-get-the-dmg-file">How to download Xcode 4 / 5 / 6 / 7 and get the DMG file?</a></p>  <p>Note: That link is for registered apple developers and I AM one as well.</p>
