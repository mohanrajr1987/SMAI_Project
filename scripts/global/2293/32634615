<p>I am trying to figure out where we are getting the App ID Prefixes while creating a new App ID at Apple Developer. While checking Apple Developer under the Apple Developer Enterprise program, it is showing 4 App ID prefixes, but I am only able to figure out the source of Team ID. I am not sure about others, though. </p>  <p>I have looked into various Apple documents but I am still confused about where we are getting them and how we can remove them.</p>  <p>It would be great if any one can help me to understand it. </p>
