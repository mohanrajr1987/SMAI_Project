<p>I faced following problem:</p>  <p>I want to close window when event from server comes. I do it in its window controller so tried:</p>  <ol> <li><code>[self close]</code></li> <li><code>[self.window close]</code></li> <li><code>[self.window performClose:self]</code></li> <li><code>[self.window orderFront:window]</code></li> </ol>  <p>None of then works. As in documentation in case of 3rd option I implemented <code>(BOOL)windowShouldClose</code> method in delegate of window. I put in my controller and it's set properly (I checked with debugger) but despite of this I hear alarm system sound when I'm trying to <code>performClose</code>. Window is created in .xib and it's also properly connected with outlet. </p>  <p>EDIT: I checked also if method <code>(BOOL)windowShouldClose</code> is invoked and it isn't but I still don't know why.</p>  <p>I would be thankful for any hint.</p>  <p>SOLUTION:</p>  <p>Just for people. Outlets were connected but not properly. Controller had custom outlet for window what caused all troubles. </p>
