<p>I have a MacPro with Linux (Ubuntu) installed as main OS.  I want to install a virtual machine with OSX (Yosemite) since I need to use Linux as my default os, and I don't want to reboot the Mac every time I need to check something in OSX. Reading the EULA I can run OSX in a virtual machine, ONLY if i use Apple Hardware. So I can do this? It's legal?</p>  <p>The other problem is that the virtual machine create under Linux not work. The same machine run in VirtualBox on OSX works. Any ideas?</p>  <p>Thanks Marco</p>
