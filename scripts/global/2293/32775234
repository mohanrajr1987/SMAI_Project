<p>I suddenly get a message on <code>iOS 9</code> :  </p>  <blockquote>   <p>The resource could not be loaded because the App Transport Security   policy requires the use of a secure connection</p> </blockquote>  <p><a href="http://lostincompilation.co/2015/09/ios9-the-resource-could-not-be-loaded-because-the-app-transport-security-policy-requires-the-use-of-a-secure-connection/" rel="nofollow"><strong>Searched</strong></a> a bit and found that setting NSAllowsArbitraryLoads to YES fixes this which actually works.<br> However I also found that <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30731785/how-do-i-load-an-http-url-with-app-transport-security-enabled-in-ios-9/30732693#30732693"><strong>Apple may reject the App</strong></a> for this.  Though stated in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/technotes/App-Transport-Security-Technote/index.html" rel="nofollow"><strong>App Transport Security Technote</strong></a> </p>  <blockquote>   <p>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</p>      <p>A Boolean value used to disable App Transport Security for any domains not listed in the NSExceptionDomains dictionary. Listed   domains use the settings specified for that domain.</p> </blockquote>  <p>But since this is the only solution working right now and also Apple <strong>may or may not</strong> reject the App, just wanted to confirm before publishing.</p>
