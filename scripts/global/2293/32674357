<p>I am learning about the AVAudioEngine API that came out with IOS8 and have downloaded the sample project to get a better idea about it.</p>  <p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/samplecode/AVAEMixerSample/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015134-Intro-DontLinkElementID_2" rel="nofollow">AVAudioEngine Sample Code</a></p>  <p>After much mucking around with building to the right target (the ipad simulators were missing for some reason, so I switched the target and main storyboard over to iphone) I wind up with a white view with black horizontal borders and this error log in the console.  Any information about this would be greatly appreciated.</p>  <p><code>Sep 19 19:52:32  AVAEMixerSample[43905] &lt;Error&gt;: CGContextSaveGState: invalid context 0x0.
