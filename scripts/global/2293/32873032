<p>Apple seems to have no documentation for how they pull the main image for your channel in Apple News. </p>  <p>This one here: </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/otty4.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/otty4.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I have og:image tags on my site + the apple-touch-icon meta. I also have images in my RSS feed. It's showing up blank. </p>  <p>Any ideas?</p>
