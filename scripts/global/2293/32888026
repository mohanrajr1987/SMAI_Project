<p>I want to personalize watch app per installation on Watch. So I need to store some local data on the watch which will be reset after I uninstalled watch app on the watch (or after unpair - pair).</p>  <p>I tried to use <code>NSUserDefaults</code> but records remain as it is even if I unpair and pair the watch again. It seems <code>NSUserDefaults</code> are kept on iOS side and not cleared even after unpair.</p>  <p>Note: My watch application is designed on watchOS 1</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
