<p>I want to do something special with MPMoviePlayerController; So that I can show option for user to select its own choice's subtitle. For example English or Spanish. Currently, i am using <a href="https://github.com/mhergon/MPMoviePlayerController-Subtitles" rel="nofollow">mhergon/MPMoviePlayerController-Subtitles</a> but it will just give support of using one subtitle.</p>  <p>I want to show options to user like this image:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ikTYW.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ikTYW.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>If user will tap on Off then no subtitle will be shown (Its working); Now i want to give two language options; Means, two SRT files should work for one video and also they should be properly synced with video timing.</p>  <p>If any one experienced such a work then your help will be more appreciable. I was thinking to make some customisation work within <a href="https://github.com/mhergon/MPMoviePlayerController-Subtitles" rel="nofollow">mhergon/MPMoviePlayerController-Subtitles</a> but it may be not good because originally, its writtern for just  one subtitle.</p>
