<p>I have been searching for a long time now but I couldn't find the answer to this question. Would be great if anybody here could help me.</p>  <p>I'm working in a company which includes about 500 employees. We made an iOS App for our employees and would like to distribute this App in-house (without App Store).  Is it legal to distribute our iOS app in-house without an Apple Program like Apple Developer Enterprise Program? I know it's possible with the new Xcode 7 to install the app without such an account on any iOS devices. So <strong>why should we buy the enterprise program</strong> as a company if we could solve the distribution without any costs? And is there a limit of possible installations or any other disadvantages if we would install our apps just with Xcode 7 (without enterprise account and so on)?</p>  <p>Cheers :)</p>
