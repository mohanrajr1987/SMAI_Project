<p>How I get now the actual system language? It seems that they put regional suffix after last dash. So before <code>cs</code> is now <code>cs-DE</code> if the language is Czech and regional setting is German. But there are some languages which don't have the suffix like GB language is <code>en-GB</code> but regional setting is German.</p>  <pre><code>NSUserDefaults* defs = [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults]; NSArray* language = [defs objectForKey:@"AppleLanguages"]; NSString* preferredLang = [language objectAtIndex:0]; NSLog(@"localeIdentifier: %@", preferredLang); </code></pre>
