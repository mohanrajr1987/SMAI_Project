<p>I created two very simple Win32 applications (from Asm source). Both applications contain only a few bytes in the code section, and I also included some differences in the code section so that the OS won't think that the two executables are identical. I opened both executables with OllyDbg.</p>  <p>I would like to understand why the content of the CS and (E)IP registers displayed in OllyDbg are identical in both debug sessions. I always thought that these two registers define the memory location of the code section. (This was the case in DOS and in earlier Windows versions.)</p>  <p>Does OllyDbg see an emulated version of these registers maybe? Any ideas?</p>
