<p>I wrote a Win8 App which is calling a WCF every minute to get some Data. The Win8 App is shared via sideloading and i've got about 10 clients where this app is running.</p>  <p>So my problem is - i've got to call a special method in the WCF only every 10 minutes. But only once because this method should send Emails and i don't want them to be sent 10 times. I don't want this method to get called by every client either but have to set the timer in the win8 App. How do i set a timer who's firing his event only once every 10 minutes?</p>  <p>I've tried to set the timer in the WCF but it's not a good practice i guess (and it didn't work)?! And i'm also not allowed to write a windows service etc. for firing a timer event.</p>  <p>Am i thinking to complicated or isn't it that easy? Should i work with Backgroundthreads? Do i missunderstand sideloading? Wouldn't the timer event get fired by 10 clients every 10 minutes? I guess it would because every single client gets the other data from the WCF too.....</p>
