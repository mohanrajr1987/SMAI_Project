<p>OS: Windows 8</p>  <p>My application works using a specific hardware involving a main monitor (that is always the same) and an HDMI port that can be used to add a secondary monitor. I need to manually configure the monitors configuration. For example I don't want to change the main monitor resolution allowing the clone mode only if the main resolution is supported and so on.</p>  <p>Using Windows API I can receive the message generated by plug/unplug of the monitor (WM_DISPLAYCHANGE detected by WindowsProc), test all I want and define my configuration (QueryDisplayConfig, SetDisplayConfig, EnumDisplaySettings... ). </p>  <p>My problem is that windows automatically set the monitors configuration and so what I can do is only to make a second change to the configuration that I want. Is there a way to disable the automatic multi-monitors re-arrangement substituting it with "my own" plug'n play?</p>
