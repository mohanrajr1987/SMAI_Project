<p><strong>Background:</strong> I am developing programs on Windows8 [64-bit] with Delphi Seattle Enterprise (target O/S: Windows). I just upgraded from Delphi XE4.</p>  <p><strong>Problem:</strong> While writing code in the Delphi editor, CTRL+V to paste text isn't working - i.e. nothing is pasted.</p>  <p><strong>What I tried so far (besides researching this situation on the Web - without success):</strong></p>  <ol> <li>Ctrl+C &amp; Ctrl+V do work in other applications (Delphi XE4, Word, Notepad++, etc).</li> <li>Performing CTRL+C in Delphi then pasting that text in other programs (Word, Notepad++) using CTRL+V works fine. This suggests that the Clipboard can be successfully written to while copying.</li> <li>In Delphi, I have tried to use the menu <em>Edit...Copy</em> &amp; <em>Edit...Paste</em> options instead of the CTRL+C / CTRL+V keys - same result: no pasting.</li> <li>Delphi Editor settings: Insert Mode and Overwrite Blocks are both checked. Key Mappings is set to Default.</li> </ol>  <p><strong>My Question:</strong> What am I missing? Is this a new behaviour in Delphi Seattle?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
