<blockquote>   <p>I have functionality in my web application to export the data in CSV   format. Data is successfully exported as i can see the values by comma   separated when the file is open in <strong>normal text editor (notepad).</strong></p>      <p><strong>Issue :</strong> My Issue is when the file is open in  open office 4.0.1   (windows 8) and make changes in to the csv file than the open office   shows me the message that :</p>      <p><strong>> This Document may contain formatting or content that can not be saved   in the text CSV file format. Do you want to save the document in this   format any way ? a) Keep Current format b) Save in ODF format</strong></p>      <p>If i select the option  <code>a)</code> than it removes all comma (,) containing in that   files while the extension of file (.csv) remains same.  Why this kind   of behavior in happen only in windows 8 ? what setting need to be change in open office.Any Idea ?</p> </blockquote>
