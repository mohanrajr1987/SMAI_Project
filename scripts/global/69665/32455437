<p>I have an installer of Minor Upgrade type. (Say MyAppMinor_v.msi)</p>  <p>I built another installer of same application of type Major Upgrade type (Say MyAppMajor_v+1.msi).</p>  <p>Both of these are built using  InstallShield 2014.</p>  <p>MyApp has a Windows system service (MyService.exe) running in background. Also, MyApp has functionality to update itself from App UI; in which the application updates itself using following command:</p>  <pre><code>msiexec.exe /i MyAppMajor_v+1.msi </code></pre>  <p>This command is run from MyService.exe of MyAppMinor version.</p>  <p>After the update process is completed, the service MyService.exe for MyAppMajor version does not get installed.</p>  <p>It gives following error in Installer logs:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>MSI (s) (FC:2C) [10:17:54:387]: Product: MyAppMajor -- Error 1923.Service MyService failed to install.  Verify that you have sufficient privileges to install system services.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I do have the admin privileges on the target machine.</p>  <p>This behavior is observed only on Windows 8/8.1.</p>  <p>On Windows 7 I do not get this error and MyService runs perfectly fine on MyAppMinor to MyAppMajor upgrade.</p>
