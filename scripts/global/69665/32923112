<p>Im using windows 8.1 in a tablet that a lot of people share, so i created a basic (offline) account, because i dont want everyone logging in with their accounts and leaving multiple accounts on the tablet (it has only 16gb hdd so im trying not to use space in multiple user profiles.)</p>  <p>The thing is when i try to install a metro app, for example the metro version of foxit pdf reader, it redirects me to the microsoft store and i cant install the app unless i log in with a microsoft account.</p>  <p>I know the easy answer would be to create a bogus account just for the tablet but i also dont want the extra bandwith usage of syncing files with microsoft servers, you know if someone opens one note or mail or calendar or any of the apps that sync to the cloud. (Its on a mobile mettered connection).</p>  <p>Thank you!</p>  <p>Also, please excuse any grammar error, english is my second language :)</p>
