<p>I was using my command line on my Windows 8 pc, after I typed the ls command, then I got the following error: </p>  <p>ls.exe-System Error  The program can't start because cygintl-2.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem. </p>  <p>Actually, I have googled it and watched some vids, I have tried download a cygintl-2.dll zip file, then extracted the dll file then copy it to the system32 folder. However, it still display the error. I also tried to reinstall the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable. it was failed also. I have no idea where I can find any help about this. Hope anyone can help me. Many Thanks!!!</p>
