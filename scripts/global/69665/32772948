<p>I installed the Grunt cli with the following command?</p>  <p><code>npm install -g grunt-cli</code></p>  <p>Then I created the package.json and the Grunfile.js and run</p>  <p><code>npm install -S grunt</code></p>  <p>But <code>grunt</code> is not known by Windows. It says <em>"´grunt´ is not recognized as an internal or external command"</em>.</p>  <p>Typing <code>path</code> on console, doesn't show Grunt, and <code>where grunt</code> also fails.</p>  <p>Did everything as Administrator on a Windows 8 machine.</p>  <p>What is wrong with this installation?</p>  <p>obs: and where is it installed?</p>
