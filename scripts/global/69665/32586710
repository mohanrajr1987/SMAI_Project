<p>I've come to a point on a Windows 8 App that (according to my research) needs a Control Channel Trigger to establish a StreamSocket connection and get the response when the app is not active.</p>  <p>I've been reading <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/Hh701032" rel="nofollow">This</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/xaml/jj710181" rel="nofollow">This</a> to try to understand where should I declare a new ControlChannelTrigger, is it on my background task? Or is it where I declare a new BackGround Task? I'm getting a little confused about it.</p>  <p>Any help would be great.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
