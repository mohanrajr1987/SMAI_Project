<p>I am building a hybrid app using SAPUI5 and packaging it with Cordova. I also have a windows 8 tablet on which I need to test the app on. I used to work on Visual studio 2012 professional and the app packages used to work fine. But when I moved to Visual studio 2013 express edition for Windows (Update 5) it asks me to retarget the Windows 8 app to Windows 8.1. <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/zliwL.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/zliwL.png" alt="The create package option is disabled as shown"></a></p>  <p>But the cordova developer site mentions that the express edition of Visual Studio 2013 supports Windows 8 development. <a href="http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/4.0.0/guide_platforms_win8_index.md.html#Windows%20Platform%20Guide" rel="nofollow">http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/4.0.0/guide_platforms_win8_index.md.html#Windows%20Platform%20Guide</a></p>  <p>How can I get it to target package for Windows 8? If not, is it possible to install Windows 8.1 apps on Windows 8?</p>
