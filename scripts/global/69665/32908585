<p>I'm fairly new to the windows 8/10 app creation game.</p>  <p>I'm looking for some info on how to get started with creating a windows 8/10 app with CRM on premise.</p>  <p>The problem i am currently facing is how to authenticate so that I can then start retrieving and creating records. Usually in .Net pages, i would use the OrganizationServiceProxy with the windows client credentials to authenticate, but when i do that in this app, it throws an error saying it can't find the System.ServiceModel" library.</p>  <p>Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
