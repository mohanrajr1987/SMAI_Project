<p>I am trying to launch a Windows Store application from a C# Windows Forms App on Windows 10. I tried some approaches what (probably?) works on Windows 8 but don't work on 10. I tried as follows:</p>  <pre><code>Process.Start("explorer", @"shell:AppsFolder\AppUserModelId") </code></pre>  <p>or</p>  <pre><code>Process.Start(@"C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\App Certification Kit\Microsoft.Windows.SoftwareLogo.AppxLauncher.exe", "AppUserModelId"); or IApplicationActivationManager::ActivateApplication </code></pre>  <p>This works, but only from the command line (which tells me that using AppUserModelId is correct).</p>  <p>Anyone knows a working solution?</p>
