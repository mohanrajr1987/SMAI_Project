<p>I have a question about a program called "8" in my autostart.</p>  <p>I'm using Windows 8 and yesterday my Computer couldn't start correctly. After the login the Display stayed blue and nothing happend. After a while of testing I recognised that i can open the taskmanager. In autostart I saw a program called "8", after deactivate it my computer starts correctly.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Qo1EK.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Qo1EK.png" alt="https://www.dropbox.com/s/0rwyyj2gq1jtdq5/Program8.png?dl=0"></a> </p>  <p>So now I want to know if anyone of you have the same Problem or know where the programm come from. I didn't installed any software since a week.</p>
