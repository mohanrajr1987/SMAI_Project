<p>I have a universal app for Windows 8.1 and Phone 8.1 and am looking to make the jump to Windows 10.</p>  <p>Looking at the guides, I need to recreate the projects, but does this mean this new project will only work on Windows 10?</p>  <p>What is the strategy for this setup? Keep a Windows 8.1 version and a Windows 10 version? Or does the Windows 10 version work on 8.1?</p>
