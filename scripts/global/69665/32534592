<p>The power button on my Toshiba tablet is worn out from being pressed frequently. I tried to find an app on the Windows Store to toggle the screen on and off (I have a similar widget for Android) but couldn't find anything so I thought I would try writing my own. </p>  <p>I don't have any experience in writing windows metro apps and wouldn't even know where to start, but this seems like it would be a simple app to write. Does anyone have a resource to some windows 8 app framework/documentation? I'd appreciate any feedback.</p>  <p>Thanks,</p>  <p>Tom Carnevale</p>
