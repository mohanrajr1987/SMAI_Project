<p>I uninstalled Java and JRE (with Windows Add/Remove Programs) and reinstalled them.  When I went to look at the settings I noticed some that I changed were still changed.  </p>  <p>How do I restore the original, default setting for Java?  (I see a couple buttons to restore some things, but not the general settings or security settings.)</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
