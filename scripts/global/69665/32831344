<p>I am using a Win 8.1 machine to develop an ASP.Net MVC website. One controller action uses the Authorize attribute to control access to that action.</p>  <pre><code>  [Authorize(Users = "Jack")]     public ActionResult Index()     {         return View();     } </code></pre>  <p>The dev machine is standalone and not attached to any network domain.  When I access the action running the site on IISExpress I am prompted for a login with the domain set as "MyMachineName/Jack". But the login &amp; password do not work. The normal login for the Win 8 machine is my Microsoft account login "my email".</p>  <p>How do I go about testing the Authorize attribute locally? </p>  <p><strong>Edit</strong> I have created a local account but I don't want to have to log out and back in every time I want to test my web app. Is there a way in Win8 to "merge" the Live account and local account?</p>
