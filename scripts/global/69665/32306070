<p>Is there a tutorial or basic explanation where is documented how to manage the Soft Input Panel (SIP) in Windows 10 to accommodate the view controls?</p>  <p>Basically, now when the virtual keyboard appears in my Windows 10 Phone app, it hides the text boxes and the bottom tool bar. I need to re-accommodate the controls of the view, but I cannot info about events, patterns, etc.</p>
