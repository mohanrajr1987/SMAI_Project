<p>I recently migrated from Windows 8 / VS2013 to Windows 10 / VS2015. After doing so I can no longer build Windows 8 store apps - I'm forced to upgrade to Windows 8.1 if I want to build the project. </p>  <p>However, I maintain two builds of my app - one for Windows 8 and one for 8.1. I have a number of customers who refuse to update to 8.1 (No, I have no idea why) and I don't want to leave them with an outdated version. I've already upgraded the project to 8.1 and keep that separate. </p>  <p>Is there any way to build a Windows 8.0 app in Visual Studio 2015, without the forced upgrade? </p>
