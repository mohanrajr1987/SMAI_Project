<p>I understand how .resx files work with strings in multiple languages, and am involved with a project already using them successfully. I have <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/q/297448/39830">another question over on Programmers</a> about best practices for collaborating with translators - this one is about specifics.</p>  <p>Our translation department uses WorldServer, which I'd never heard of until this week - we don't have a great system in place for tracking or coordinating changes, and want to fix it. Right now we're copy/pasting various strings and emailing them about. WorldServer has some resources that look promising, but not much on workflow from the dev perspective:</p>  <ul> <li><a href="http://producthelp.sdl.com/SDL%20Trados%20Studio/client_en/File_Types/XML.htm" rel="nofollow">file formats</a> - indicates that .resx files are natively supported (presumably for import?)</li> <li><a href="http://docs.sdl.com/LiveContent/content/en-US/SDL%20WorldServer-v1/GUID-D694B085-FD57-4A80-A14B-58B4486CBD40" rel="nofollow">import/export</a> - discusses Translation Kits, packages of content that can be imported and exported. It mentions that these are in XLIFF format (an XML file with specific schema, <a href="http://producthelp.sdl.com/SDL%20Trados%20Studio/client_en/File_Types/XLIFF.htm" rel="nofollow">handled differently</a> from XML)</li> </ul>  <p>I'm unsure what happens on their end with actually assigning translation kits to translators, etc, but my understanding is that WorldServer is a CMS for translation content, and will track changes and missing translations (?). Presumably there is a way to pass content between Visual Studio and WorldServer, I just don't know what it is yet - and don't want to write and maintain a custom conversion tool.</p>  <ol> <li><strong>Can I send .resx files for import to WorldServer?</strong> (preferably unmodified; don't care if it's by email, repository access, etc)</li> <li><strong>Can the WorldServer export properly formatted .resx files that I can drop into my project folder?</strong> (directly or with minor modification)</li> <li><strong>If not, what other options are there for translating between these formats?</strong></li> <li>Does WorldServer track changed and/or missing resources? (extra credit)</li> </ol>
