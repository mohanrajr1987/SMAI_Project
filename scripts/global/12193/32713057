<p>I try to compare a Chinese string with a value store in locale file but i got a problem.</p>  <p>I store in my database a value selected by the user, the key/value is:</p>  <pre><code>kind: "其他国家" </code></pre>  <p>and when i try to get the value for ma comparaison i receive only : "其他国 </p>  <p>the condition is very easy and work with the other language (English and French)</p>  <p>Here the condition :</p>  <pre><code>if self.kind == I18n.t('countries.OC') #do my thing end </code></pre>  <p>litteraly I get :</p>  <pre><code>if "其他国 == "其他国家" #do my thing end </code></pre>  <p>I try to find the best to correct this, the first thing i though was to check the value before my condition and set it with the good one.</p>  <p>But i would understand why that don't take all my string from my DB.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
