<p>Currently we have a string which is translated into several languages. The string requires some formatting around a specific word and as such we're including a span in the translation string.</p>  <p>In the language file...</p>  <pre><code>return [     'signup.success.reminder' =&gt; 'This is &lt;span&gt;very&lt;/span&gt; important!' ]; </code></pre>  <p>...and then in the template...</p>  <pre><code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;?php echo \Yii::t('app', 'signup.success.reminder'); ?&gt;&lt;/p&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Given the above requirement is there a better way to include the span tag?</p>
