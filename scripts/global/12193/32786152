<p>I'm using node.js and want to create SEO friendly url (slug) but I couldn't find any guidelines for creating international slug.</p>  <p>My question is separated into two parts. </p>  <p>The first part is, do I need to convert the international word into it's english equivalent, i.e Buenos días to buenos-dias (notice the í was turned to i) and if so, is there a module that do it for all the languages? I've used <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/slug" rel="nofollow">slug</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/speakingurl" rel="nofollow">speakingurl</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/limax" rel="nofollow">limax</a> but they don't support hebrew for example. </p>  <p>The second part is, can't I just use the word as it is since it's unicode and all the major browsers support unicode urls (so it won't be transformed into his utf8 equivalent "Buenos+d%C3%ADas+").</p>  <p>If the second part is true, can someone recommend me on a node.js module that do it?</p>  <ul> <li>[EDIT] I found a way to create a slug from only letters (in all languages) by using XRegex so I only need an answer about should the slug hold unicode letters or only english.</li> </ul>
