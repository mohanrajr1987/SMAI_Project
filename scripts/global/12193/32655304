<p>I wanted to know whether Sagepay could also be taken as a online payment processor for a business based outside of UK? Reason is, we have a website solution which integrates with Sagepay for our UK clients, and are about to implement it for a Belgium based organisation: could we tell these that they could register with you, or do they need to stick to local companies such as Ogone? </p>  <p>Thanks, Stephane</p>
