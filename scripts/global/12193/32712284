<p>There are many resources out there dealing with translation but I'm still confused.</p>  <p>My goal is to develop an app in German and translate the storyboard and strings used in the code. German must be the base for translations into additional languages.</p>  <p>The app will be translated into English at least. If the device preferred language is not German, the fallback language must be English. For example, on an "Spanish" device the English strings are displayed.</p>  <p>But if I change CFBundleDevelopmentRegion to German, the fallback language will be German (according to this <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/qa/qa1828/_index.html" rel="nofollow">Technical Note</a>). </p>  <p>How can I have different development and fallback languages?</p>  <p>Thanks a lot for the clarifications.</p>
