<p>I'm using Rails and I'm new to i18n (but not new to Rails).</p>  <p>I have some certain pieces of content that vary from country to country but doesn't care about language. This is of course different from most pieces of content under i18n which are scoped to locale.</p>  <p>The first thing that comes to my mind is to create a <code>config/countries</code> directory and have <code>us.yml</code>, <code>eb.yml</code>, etc.</p>  <p>(The way I know the user's country is that each user record in the database has a country associated with it.)</p>  <p>My question: <strong>Has anybody else developed a standard way of handling country-specific but language-independent content that I can copy before I (potentially poorly) reinvent the wheel?</strong></p>
