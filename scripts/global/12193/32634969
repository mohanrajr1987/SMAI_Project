<p>I am using mentioned bundle in my application, and I would like to be able to configure it this way: </p>  <pre><code>jms_i18n_routing:     default_locale: en     locales: [en, de]     strategy: custom     hosts:         en: [mydomain.com, subdomain.domain.com]         de: mydomain.de     redirect_to_host: false </code></pre>  <p>so multiple domains to one locale. I would like to run two similiar websites at one application to have access to the 90% of the code which is similiar and same database. Any tips how could i achieve this? Or maybe there is other bundle/solution more accurate for my problem?</p>
