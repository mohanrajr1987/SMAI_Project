<p>We're using the Kendo UI ASP.NET MVC wrappers to render our grids. I've got localisation working as described in <a href="http://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/aspnet-mvc/globalization#localization" rel="nofollow">this article</a> but the problem I have is that if the browser culture gets resolved as language neutral (just language level, for example "fr" instead of "fr-FR") the localisation doesn't work and the grid is rendered as "en-US".</p>  <p>Is there a simple way of making the wrappers use the localisations in this scenario?</p>  <p>I guess I could force the culture somehow and in the worst case compile the Kendo dll with additional resources but thought I would ask first.</p>  <p>Thanks for any pointers!</p>
