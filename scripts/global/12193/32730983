<p>I have the follwoing configured in my <em>application.rb</em></p>  <pre><code>config.i18n.available_locales = [:at, :de, :ch_de, :ch_fr, :fr, :int_en, :int_fr] config.i18n.default_locale = :at </code></pre>  <p>My default locale is set to :at (Austria). Which I require for Route Translation. Rails server won't start without it and to be fair it makes sense. </p>  <p>I now created a fallback map, which works just fine: </p>  <pre><code>config.i18n.fallbacks = {'de' =&gt; 'at', 'ch_de' =&gt; 'at', 'ch_fr' =&gt; 'fr', 'int_fr' =&gt; 'fr', 'fr' =&gt; 'fr', 'int_en' =&gt; 'int_en'} </code></pre>  <p>So basically I want all German speaking countries to fallback on :at, whilst all French speaking countries fall back to :fr.</p>  <p>However, I do NOT under any circumstances want :fr to fallback on :at. This is for SEO purposes as some french pages do not have metadata configured. So now the french pages would display the Austrian :at metadata entry. Which is wrong. </p>  <p>If I turn of fallbacks completely: </p>  <pre><code>config.i18n.fallbacks = false </code></pre>  <p>the following works fine in my views: </p>  <pre><code>t('.metatitle', :default =&gt; "") </code></pre>  <p>In that case if there is no translation available then nothing is displayed. However, the rest of the site that already exists relies on fallbacks - so this is not an option, considering the effort to implement the change. </p>  <p><strong>Is there a way turn off fallbacks for individual translations?</strong> </p>  <p><strong>Or can I implement the fallback map and make sure that the map doesn't fallback to it's default locale if for example no french :fr translation exists?</strong> </p>  <p>PS: The route translating gem that requires the default locale is <a href="https://github.com/enriclluelles/route_translator" rel="nofollow">this one here</a>.</p>  <p>Thank you for your help !</p>
