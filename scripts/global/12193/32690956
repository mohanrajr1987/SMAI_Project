<p>I've been reading Apple's docs and some related posts and I only found the way to localize the strings in an <code>storyboard</code>. In fact, I currently have a "Base" <code>storyboard</code> file and then one <code>.strings</code> file per each language I want to support.</p>  <p>What if I, for example, need to set different constraints in scenes according to the language? Or if I want to set different controls according to the country/language? How could I handle that?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
