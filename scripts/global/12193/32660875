<p>I have an app infrastructure based on Jade template engine and Gulp as building tool. App is set of static HTML pages generated by Gulp.</p>  <p>I have JSON-files (en.json, ru.json...) that contains translations and in output I want to see HTML files saved on corresponding folders (./en/index.html, ./en/test.html; ./ru/index.html, ./ru/test.html...).</p>  <p>Now I use <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-data" rel="nofollow">gulp-data</a> plugin, but it doesn't provide any method to interpolate strings in my JSON files, so I can't write like </p>  <pre><code>{     "TITLE": "Hello, {{user}}, how are you?" } </code></pre>  <p>and use it like this one (yes, angular on frontend:))</p>  <pre><code>.title t('TITLE', {user: '&lt;span ng-bind="User.firstName"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;'}) </code></pre>  <p>I think that thing that can help me is <a href="http://i18next.com/" rel="nofollow">i18next</a>, but I don't understand how to use it in my infrastructure with Gulp build tool (I found only examples with express server). Maybe, it has simple way to use it with Gulp? Or maybe there are something like gulp-data plugin with interpolation possibility?</p>
