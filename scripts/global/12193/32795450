<p>do you know if there's some software (I'd prefer a web application) that allows us to translate languages as a team? It would be nice to assign a person to languages, so that he / she could translate the texts and an administrator could export that into a json file for the use with i18next.</p>  <p>I'm afraid that could be too specific but I'd try to ask anyway :)</p>  <p>If you don't know an application for exporting a hierarchical language file do you some more generic?</p>
