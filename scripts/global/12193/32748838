<p>Running into this issue.</p>  <p>I need to split up urls to get values from them. This works great when its all english.</p>  <p>URL = /78965asdvc34/Test/testBasins</p>  <p>Pattern = /%{WORD:org}/(?i)test/%{WORD:name}</p>  <p>I get this in the grok debugger. {"org":[["78965asdvc34"]],"name":[["testBasins"]]}</p>  <p>If I have international characters, grok does not read them with the pattern above.</p>  <p>/78965asdvc34/Test/浸水Basins</p>  <p>Any thoughts how to get this to work? This value can be in any language in the logs, and hopefully there is a way to get it out.</p>
