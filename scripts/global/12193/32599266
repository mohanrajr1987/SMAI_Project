<p>See my previous question: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32195708/cannot-write-chinese-characters-to-a-filename">Cannot write chinese characters to a filename</a> This question is similar to that but a slight change, causes the solution in that question to no longer work.</p>  <p>I am now trying to take in a filename as a program argument and if the characters are Chinese (or Japanese or similar) they will be swapped to <code>?</code> and I will get an exception.</p>  <p>Run Configurations > Common > Encoding = <code>UTF-8</code></p>  <p>Program Arguments: <code>你好.txt</code></p>  <p>Main:</p>  <pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {     String fileName = args[0];      Writer out = new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(             new FileOutputStream("C:/temp/"+fileName+".txt"), "UTF-8"));//Ex thrown     out.close(); } </code></pre>  <p>Exception: <code>Exception in thread "main" java.io.FileNotFoundException: C:\temp\??.txt.txt (The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect)</code></p>  <p>How can I make this work?</p>
