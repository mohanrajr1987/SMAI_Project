<p>Working on an app in Symfony 2 and looking at internationalisation/localisation. The default behaviour for routing is to use the language which works fine for i18n but not really for l10n.</p>  <p>i.e. The content for the US site will be different from the UK content but the route would be /en.</p>  <p>We could use /en_GB in the route, but it would be nicer if we could use /gb (or better yet, /uk)</p>  <p>Is there a way of doing this that doesn't involve inventing our own way of handling locales?</p>
