<p>I'm in the midst of globalizing a large legacy .Net web application. No previous thought had been given to globalization so it is turning out to be quite a large task.</p>  <p>Right now I'm concentrating on displaying and storing numbers and dates correctly. I've read a bit on the subject and my general strategy is to use Invariant Culture in business logic and data access layers when formatting and parsing numbers and dates, so they can be persisted in a consistent culture. Then I try to avoid formatting to the users locale until the last possible moment in the presentation layer.</p>  <p>Until now I have been searching the solution for .toString and various parse methods in the business logic and data access layer and making sure InvariantCulture is specified. Since I don't want to deal with the users locale in these layers would it not be possible to make sure that invariant culture is used everywhere in these layers. Does anyone have any opinions or differing ideas on this subject?</p>
