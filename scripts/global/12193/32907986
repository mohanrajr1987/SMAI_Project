<p>According to <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/basic_ostream/operator_ltlt2" rel="nofollow">cppref</a>, there is an <code>operator &lt;&lt;</code> overload for <code>std::basic_ostream&lt;wchar_t&gt;</code> that accepts <code>const char*</code>. It seems that the convert operation simply widens each <code>char</code> into a <code>wchar_t</code>. That is, the number of wide characters converted (inserted) is equal to the number of narrow characters. So here comes a problem. The narrow character string may be encoding international characters, say Chinese characters using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GB_2312" rel="nofollow">GB2312</a>. Further assume that <code>sizeof(wchar_t)</code> is <code>2</code> and uses UTF16 encoding. Then how should this naive character-wise converting method work?</p>
