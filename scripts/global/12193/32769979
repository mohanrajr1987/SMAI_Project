<p>We enabled language translation on a previously non-translated site that used language neutral for all nodes. Some fields are set as translatable, while others, understandably, are not. We converted fields that are translatable to English by adding an entry for that field with the language set to English, leaving an entry with language undefined there as well. This was recommended to us.</p>  <p>One of the issues we're having now is that <strong>when an editor deletes the entry for a field in the edit form, the English value is removed but the undefined value still displays on the page</strong>, though it is not accessible in the edit form because it's language does not match the node's language.</p>  <p>This doesn't seem to be a good idea to display an 'und' entry for a translatable field on a node with a stated language. field_is_translatable() confirms that the field is translatable.</p>  <p>Has anyone else run across this? Not sure if this is a bug or if there is a best practice for fixing this.</p>  <p>My thought at this point is to write a script to run through each node that is English (not 'und'), check each translatable field, remove any 'und' entries in the object for translatable fields, and re-save the node.</p>  <p>We are using the following translation related modules:</p>  <ul> <li>translation</li> <li>entity_translation</li> <li>field_translation</li> <li>i18n_field</li> <li>i18n_menu</li> <li>i18n_string</li> <li>i18n_taxonomy</li> <li>i18n_translation</li> <li>i18n_variable</li> <li>i18n_views</li> <li>lingotek</li> </ul>
