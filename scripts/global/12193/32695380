<p>I develop websites based on the Symfony2 framework, and I have quality problems due to missing translations. This is particular true for non visible translations like image alt attribut or page meta-data.</p>  <p>To solve that problem, I would like Symfony to stop the page render on missing translation, by throwing an exception.</p>  <p>How can I tell the Symfony translator not to accept any missing translation in the dev environment? (for translations made from code, using the translator service and from templates, using the trans filter)</p>
