<p>At the end of my code next to the final <code>}</code>, My code throws 5 "expected declaration" errors. I actually ended up making a whole new Xcode project and it was still giving me this error... I've searched in a bunch of different places and no one seems to have the same problem.. My only theory on this is that it's the code that I'm copypasting from the other project. I have not upgraded to Swift 2 yet.</p>  <p>Here's the code for the class: `</p>  <pre><code>import UIKit  class ViewController:        UIViewController,UIImagePickerControllerDelegate, UINavigationControllerDelegate, UITextFieldDelegate {     @IBOutlet weak var imagePickerView: UIImageView!     @IBOutlet weak var cameraButton: UIToolbar!      override func viewDidLoad() {         super.viewDidLoad()         // Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib.     }      override func didReceiveMemoryWarning() {         super.didReceiveMemoryWarning()         // Dispose of any resources that can be recreated.     }     @IBAction func pickFromAlbum(sender: AnyObject) {         let imagePicker = UIImagePickerController()         imagePicker.delegate = self         imagePicker.sourceType = UIImagePickerControllerSourceType.PhotoLibrary         self.presentViewController(imagePicker, animated: true, completion: nil)         imagePicker.sourceType = UIImagePickerControllerSourceType.PhotoLibrary     }     @IBAction func pickFromCamera(sender: AnyObject) {         let imagePicker = UIImagePickerController()         imagePicker.delegate = self         self.presentViewController(imagePicker, animated: true, completion: nil)         imagePicker.sourceType = UIImagePickerControllerSourceType.Camera     }     func imagePickerController(picker: UIImagePickerController, didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo info: [NSObject : AnyObject]) {         if let image = info[UIImagePickerControllerOriginalImage] as? UIImage {             imagePickerView.image = image             self.dismissViewControllerAnimated(true, completion: nil)         } } ` </code></pre>
