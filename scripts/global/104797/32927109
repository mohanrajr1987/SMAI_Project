<p>I have a project A, which I started writing with Swift1-Xcode6. I have some extension files like: </p>  <pre><code>extension UIView {     convenience init(x: CGFloat, y: CGFloat, w: CGFloat, h: CGFloat) {         self.init(frame: CGRect(x: x, y: y, width: w, height: h))     } } </code></pre>  <p>I created a new project B and copied these extension files in there. I am getting this error:</p>  <pre><code>UIViewExtensions.swift:11:11: Use of undeclared type 'UIView' </code></pre>  <p>Files in Project-A do not need the inclusion of UIKit, but Project-B does. What is the reason?</p>
