<p>I have 2 times that create a time range that a map annotation is visible(a start time and an end time).  Whenever the current time is greater than the end time, the annotation is removed. The user inputs the times as a string then I add that time string to the current date string, then I convert the date as "h:mm a, M/dd/yyyy" into an actual date.  The problem I am having is that if someone says the event starts at night (PM) then ends in the early morning or something (AM) then the event annotation is instantly removed because it creates the end time as AM time of the day that is about to end instead of the new day.  Here is my current method for getting the time strings in code:</p>  <pre><code>let SpotStartTime = StartTimeTextField.text;     let SpotEndTime = EndTimeTextField.text;      let date = NSDate();     let formatter = NSDateFormatter();     formatter.dateFormat = "M/dd/yyyy";      let Date = formatter.stringFromDate(date)      let EndTime = SpotEndTime;        let RealEndTime = (EndTime! + ", " + Date);     print(RealEndTime); </code></pre>  <p>then I convert this string into a date using this method: </p>  <pre><code>let TimeStr = EndTime     let dateFormater : NSDateFormatter = NSDateFormatter()    dateFormater.dateFormat = "h:mm a, M/dd/yyyy    let EndDate = (dateFormater.dateFromString(TimeStr))            let realEnd = EndDate </code></pre>  <p>How do I modify this so that I can compare the StartTimeTextField to the EndTimeTextField?  I need something that basically compares the two and if the StartTimeTextField has "PM" in it and the EndTimeTextField has "AM" in it then the EndTime gets 24 hours added to it, but I don't know how to do this in code.  Can anyone help? Thanks</p>
