<p>I want to keep annotations that match an <code>id</code> property stored inside an <code>MKAnnotation</code> subclass. Inside of <code>regionDidChangeAnimated</code> I'm looping through <code>self.mapView.annotations</code> and checking their <code>id</code>, but it's always <code>nil</code>.</p>  <p>Does this have something to do with an object lifecycle I'm not understanding? Once the point gets added to the map, is my annotation object transformed somehow? Is there any way to get these stored values to do what I'm hoping?</p>
