<p>All,</p>  <p>I would like to get likes of Facebook user in my mobile app. I got facebook id of the user through an API and need to get likes of the user for further analysis. Looks like the latest Facebook API doesn't provide this info.   </p>  <p>id = 716290205; url = "<a href="https://www.facebook.com/someuseridgoeshere" rel="nofollow">https://www.facebook.com/someuseridgoeshere</a>"</p>  <p>Please suggest if you have any ideas to get Facebook likes of a user with above information in mobile app.</p>
