<p>I'm trying to create wxFrames on the click on a button from the TopWindow of a wx application. Even though the frames are being instantiated, and I can clearly see them, when I close the application(the child frame), a few questions arise:</p>  <h2>Several Problems</h2>  <ul> <li>I can't open the same frame again. I'm not instantiating anything so I don't know why that would be the error.</li> <li>I can't close the parent frame in one click. The parent frame first removes all of its children in the app, and then I would have to click the red x button once more to close it. </li> <li>Upon closing the parent frame, I can't open up another instance from my IDE(I'm using Enthought Canopy). I would have to restart the python instance and then refresh. </li> </ul>  <h2>Illustration of the 2nd problem</h2>  <p>Here's an illustration of the glitchy parent frame:</p>  <h3>Before clicking the close button</h3>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Wrlls.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Wrlls.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <h3>After clicking the close button</h3>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/w4OcW.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/w4OcW.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I don't understand why this would be happening. Here is my code:</p>  <pre><code>class AppManager(wx.Frame):     CHOICES = {}     def __init__(self, parent):         # build a frame         wx.Frame.__init__(self, parent, wx.ID_ANY, "Image Calculator", size = (700, 170), style=wx.DEFAULT_FRAME_STYLE ^ wx.RESIZE_BORDER)         frameSize = wx.DisplaySize()         print frameSize         self.CHOICES = {"ImageCalc2Beta": imageCalc(parent = None),          ... More wxFrames ...         "DarkNoiseGrapherV3": DarkNoiseGrapherv3_Unstable(None, frameSize)}         # build a panelz     self.mainPanel = wx.Panel(self, wx.ID_ANY)      # sizer     self.buttonSizer = wx.GridSizer(4,0)     # build buttons for selecting files ==================================================     self.imageCalc2Beta = wx.Button(self.mainPanel, id=wx.ID_ANY, label = "Open ImageCalc2Beta")     self.imageCalc2Beta.name = "ImageCalc2Beta"     self.imageCalc2Beta.Bind(wx.EVT_BUTTON, self.openApp)     ... more buttons binding to the event ...     self.DarkNoiseGrapherV3 = wx.Button(self.mainPanel, id=wx.ID_ANY, label = "Open DarkNoiseGrapherV3")     self.DarkNoiseGrapherV3.name = "DarkNoiseGrapherV3"     self.DarkNoiseGrapherV3.Bind(wx.EVT_BUTTON, self.openApp)      #adding buttons into sizer     self.buttonSizer.Add(self.imageCalc2Beta)      self.buttonSizer.Add(self.DarkNoiseGrapherV3)        #Setting sizer to panel     self.mainPanel.SetSizer(self.buttonSizer)     ... more adding buttons ...     self.mainPanel.Layout()      def openApp(self, event):         self.frame = self.CHOICES[event.GetEventObject().name]         self.frame.Show()  # below is needed for all GUIs if __name__== '__main__':     app = wx.App(False) # application object (inner workings)      frame = AppManager(parent = None) # frame object (what user sees)     frame.Show() # show frame     app.MainLoop() # run main loop   </code></pre>  <p>Note that each individual wxFrame child in the dictionary works independently. I'm just trying to create an application to consolidate them together.</p>  <p>Note: I tried to do this with a dummy wx.Frame but was not able to replicate the error, so I'm guessing it may be a part of my other wx.Frame applications' implementation. However, I don't know which parts of the code to display.</p>
