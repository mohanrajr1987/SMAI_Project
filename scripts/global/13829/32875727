<p>I'm programming in java and am using XML-RPC to submit data from a client to a server. My problem is that when I XmlRpcClient.execute code but whenever I have a connection error, the application gets stuck until I eventually get a Timeout exception (which I want). I placed this whole process in a new thread and wanted the ability to stop/cancel the process if I didn't want to wait for the timeout.</p>  <p>I learned how to stop Threads but idk if I can interrupt the XmlRpcClient.execute code.</p>  <p>any ideas?</p>
