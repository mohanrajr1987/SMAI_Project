<p>I am currently developing a web application on C# Web API.</p>  <p>I am thinking about having a static variable to keep track of currently logged in user. So I don't have to pass the session object or user object back and forth between controllers and models.</p>  <p>Sample code:</p>  <pre><code>using System;  namespace Model.TwoScoopsOfASP {     public class SessionHelper     {         [ThreadStatic] public static Member.Member loggedMember;     } } </code></pre>  <p>Since I am quite new to this tech stack so I couldn't see if there is any big problem with this approach.  Please help me to point any big issue that you can think of.</p>  <p><strong>Note</strong>: I haven't implemented the Thread-safe singleton pattern so please ignore it for now. Thanks</p>
