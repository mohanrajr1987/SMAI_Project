<p>I have a multi-thread VB.net program. and I want to loop through each thread and get the session from each one.</p>  <p>here's the code that creates the threads.</p>  <pre><code>Sub Run():     Timer1.Enabled = True     AddHandler LoginTimer.Elapsed, AddressOf doWork     LoginTimer.Interval = 500     LoginTimer.Enabled = True End Sub </code></pre>  <p>and here's the doWork() sub:</p>  <pre><code>sub doWork()     For id = 0 to val(textbox1.text) ' get how many thread should we run                 Dim th As New Thread(AddressOf Work) ' what the threads should do.                 th.IsBackground = True                 th.Start()     Next id </code></pre>  <p>Now every time I close the program, the threads became aborted and I lost all the stuff that those threads have been working on. So, I want to save the sessions. and the Next time when I run I'd just 'resume' it by loading back the sessions. Something like:</p>  <pre><code>Private Sub Form1_FormClosing(sender As Object, e As FormClosingEventArgs) Handles Me.FormClosing     Dim sessions As New List(Of String)     For Each thread In xxxx ' here where should I do a loop through the running threads        sessions.Add(thread.session) ' get the session from the thread     Next thread  End Sub </code></pre>  <p>Thanks in advance </p>  <p>EDIT: I've managed to fix my problem by creating a "Public Shared ShoulIupadteNow as Boolean", since the threads i have are running in continuous loop they all the time check if the Boolean set to true. and when it is ( i usually click on a button that set it to true on my form ) it starts updating by having a public shared lstsessions as new hashset(of string) this way I won't have duplicate sessions and once all threads finished updating I loop through all the content in the hashset and then store it in txt files.</p>
