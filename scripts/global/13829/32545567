<p>I have two threads that compete over a single resource, but frequently either thread is required to perform some other tasks. Is there a mechanism available that [<strong>1.</strong> allows me to acquire an exclusive lock] but [<strong>2.</strong> can be interrupted while it is waiting]</p>  <p>I would prefer to avoid timeouts (i.e. Monitor.TryEnter) to minimize time overhead.</p>  <p>Thank you for your advice.</p>
