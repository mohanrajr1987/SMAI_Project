<p>So there I was, right. Just looking through some code, studying bits and pieces when all of a sudden, my ocular receptors were assaulted by the unfamiliar. I was like: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>What!!! What's that all about!</p> </blockquote>  <p>Anyway, what I saw was (<a href="https://github.com/rilian/devise-doorkeeper-cancan-api-example/blob/master/app/controllers/api/base_controller.rb#L23-L25" rel="nofollow">source</a>):</p>  <pre><code>def authenticate_user!   if doorkeeper_token     Thread.current[:current_user] = User.find(doorkeeper_token.resource_owner_id)   end    # ... end </code></pre>  <p>So after looking at it for a while, thinking:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Wtf is this <code>Thread.current[]</code> insanity? Is this even necessary? What's it even trying to do?</p> </blockquote>  <p>It seemed to me it was kind of like wearing a baseball cap backwards: You may look pretty f'ing cool but that sun glare is winning. I then decided to Google around, read some articles and some SO.</p>  <p>None seemed to concisely answer my question: <strong>Given the context of the code, would it not be the same as:</strong></p>  <pre><code>def authenticate_user!   if doorkeeper_token     @current_user = User.find(doorkeeper_token.resource_owner_id)   end    # ... end </code></pre>  <p>If not, what situation/scenario is it useful/protecting against?</p>  <p>I hope you enjoyed my story and want to contribute an awesome ending.</p>
