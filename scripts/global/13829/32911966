<p>When writing the transformer method of a Spring XD processor, do I have any guarantee that the code will be executed in a single thread?</p>  <p>If I understood correctly the architecture section of the Spring XD Guide (version 1.2.1), DIRT will deploy at most one copy of a module for any stream at any given time, am I correct? And if that's the case, does that mean I can write the code without worrying to make it reentrant?</p>  <p>Thank you in advance.</p>
