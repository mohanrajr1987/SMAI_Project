<p>I am trying to <strong>measure</strong> size of a styled string block from single non-main thread.</p>  <p>AFAIK, <code>NSAttributedString</code> is a part of Foundation, so it is fine to use them from single non-main thread.</p>  <p>But when I tried to set paragraph style (line break mode, alignment, etc.) I realized that I have to use <code>NSParagraphStyle</code> class. And the class is a part of UIKit. That means the class is not allowed to use in non-main thread by default. I tried to find some mention about using this class from non-main thread, but I failed.</p>  <p>My last resort is measuring and drawing everything using Core Text, but I like to avoid it where possible.</p>  <p>Can I use this class <code>NSParagraphStyle</code> from non-main thread?</p>
