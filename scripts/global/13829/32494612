<p>According to the CXF FAQ (<a href="http://cxf.apache.org/faq.html" rel="nofollow">http://cxf.apache.org/faq.html</a>), </p>  <blockquote>   <p>"CXF proxies are thread safe for MANY use cases. The exceptions are:   ... <strong>settings on the conduit</strong> "</p> </blockquote>  <p>We have the code calling setMessageObserver() method on the conduit. Our pre-production deployment experience revealed no thread issues here. <br> I suppose, either the FAQ is not updated for new CXF version, or it could be thread-safe for our case. <strong><br> Do you know CXF proxy behavior (thread-safe or not) for this case?</strong></p>
