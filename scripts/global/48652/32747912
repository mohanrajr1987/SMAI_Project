<p>I am looking to make an <code>ImageView</code> that I can manipulate with touch (translate, scale and rotate). I currently have one that uses <code>ScaleType.MATRIX</code> and can be translated and scaled. I would like to be able to wrap this <code>ImageView</code> with a border, and put <code>ImageButton</code> objects in the corners to act as a 'close' and 'scale/rotate' button. Much like in the image below (taken from the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aviary.android.feather&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">Aviary</a> app):</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5PpTL.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5PpTL.jpg" alt="Aviary Example Image"></a></p>  <p>I cannot figure out where to start with this. In order to manipulate the <code>ImageView</code> I need to set the view to <code>MATCH_PARENT</code>, and use a <code>Matrix</code> to manipulate the drawable within it. But then how am I supposed to wrap the drawable in a border?</p>  <p>Or am I supposed to manipulate the <code>ImageView</code> directly instead of the drawable? If so, how would I go about doing that with a <code>Matrix</code>?</p>
