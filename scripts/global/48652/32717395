<p>I have a square ImageView. A user can take a vertical photo and it will be placed in the ImageView. Right now I'm using <code>android:scaleType="fitXY"</code> which crops the photo from the top and stops about halfway down the photo.</p>  <p>I want it where it begins the crop from the centre of the photo, leaving the upper and lower extremes out of the ImageView. I have tried using <code>centreCrop</code> but not sure it's the right method. Should I be using a Matrix? Thanks.</p>
