<p>I already searched on this matter and the answers weren’t very clear what’s the best way to achieve this <strong>without using Bitmap</strong>. </p>  <p>I want to add various markers/pins over an image, like for example an ImageView without using a Bitmap. </p>  <p>The objective is to have a big image (e.g. an indoor map) that I can zoom/pan and I need to hardcode all this markers over it like locations.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
