<p>I currently have an application that utilizes the <code>ImageViewTouch</code> class from the <a href="https://github.com/sephiroth74/ImageViewZoom" rel="nofollow">ImageViewZoom</a> repository. I am overlaying more <code>ImageView</code> objects (stickers) on top of this <code>ImageViewTouch</code> that can be manipulated separately (scaled, rotated and translated). But when I interact with the <code>ImageViewTouch</code> I would like the <code>ImageView</code> objects on top of it to scale and translate as if they were on the same plane as the <code>ImageViewTouch</code>. My current implementation utilizes custom <code>Matrix</code> addition and subtraction methods to produce this effect:</p>  <pre><code>public void onMatrixChanged() {     Matrix displayMatrix = mEditorImage.getDisplayMatrix();     Matrix matrix;      for (StickerView sticker : mStickers) {         Matrix stickerMatrix = sticker.getImageMatrix();          matrix = MatrixUtils.subtract(displayMatrix, mPrevMatrix);         matrix = MatrixUtils.add(stickerMatrix, matrix);          sticker.setImageMatrix(matrix);     }     mPrevMatrix = displayMatrix; } </code></pre>  <p>Though this method only seems to work right when the <code>ImageView</code> is located at the origin (top-left corner of the screen), otherwise the scale seems correct but the translation is off. I do not know if there is a better way of getting the desired effect, or if I am on the right track and missing something.</p>
