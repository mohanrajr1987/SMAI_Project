<p>I have a background Image that fills the Screen and a small Image that is moveable around the screen/background.</p>  <p>How can I set the ImageView relative to the background in the upper left corner (I think that there is (0/0)?).</p>  <p>I'm asking because I want to implement the zoom method later. In that case I want to have the distance between these points so, if I move around the,the distance to the upper left corner of the background is fix.</p>  <p>So in case of <code>MotionEvent.ACTION_MOVE</code>, the image won't move and is set fix to the upper left corner of the background.</p>  <p>For example:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/UeWiR.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/UeWiR.png" alt="enter image description here"></a> </p>  <p>I want to get this distance. Note that the background is grey and the image is blue.</p>  <p>I hope you understand my problem!</p>  <p>Kind Regards!</p>
