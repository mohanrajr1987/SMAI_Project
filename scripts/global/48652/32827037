<p>I am very new to programming but I am asked to write an Android application.... So I want to ask if I want to write an application to show 5 activities and a bottom bar navigating users to the corresponding activity, should I use a tabbed view or insert 5 image view buttons?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/xdjbV.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/xdjbV.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
