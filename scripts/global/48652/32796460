<p>I have a code which zooms and pans the imageview matrix, it works well but i want the imageview to not be zoomed smaller than my screen, and i don't want it to be zoomed very much, i want to set a limit for zooming and to the same thing for dragging(panning) it should pan horizontally if image's width is larger than screen, and it should pan vertically if image's height is larger than the screen, how can i achieve this result ? i tried some methods from mike Ortiz's but i couldn't get them to work.</p>
