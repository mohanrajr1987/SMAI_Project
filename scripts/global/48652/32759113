<p>Please look at following 2 layouts. </p>  <p>First, <code>cardview</code>: <a href="http://pastebin.com/iYzUiDQ7" rel="nofollow">http://pastebin.com/iYzUiDQ7</a></p>  <p>Second, <code>LinearLayout</code> only (layout is actually the same as the one inside my CardView): <a href="http://pastebin.com/xijHZCPw" rel="nofollow">http://pastebin.com/xijHZCPw</a></p>  <p>So, second layout contains <code>WebView</code> component + single <code>LinearLayout</code> under it that should represent the same layout as single <code>CardView</code> item.</p>  <p>It works, however... I'm having problems with scaling images. If I  set very large image as image for my <code>ImageView</code> placed on <code>CardView</code>, it will be scaled nicely to fit on my <code>CardView</code>. <code>CardView's</code> height won't be changed, instead, image will be scaled proportionally to fit.</p>  <p>But when I'm trying to do the same with second layout I linked, my <code>LinearLayout</code> changes its height if I set large image. How should I change my second layout to get the same effect for my <code>LinearLayout</code>, placed at bottom of my screen?</p>
