<p>I´m new in android development. I want to create a game where the user needs to quickly drag and drop balls with the finger in the screen to specific locations in order to win. I don´t know if i can do this with simple ImageViews or i need to use canvas or other thing to draw in the screen. I have tried to drag and drop an ImageView on top of another ImageView but it does not seem to work very well and i'm hesitating if i need to do it drawing figures instead of using the ImageViews or to do something else. Please advice. Any help is apreciated. Thank you.</p>
