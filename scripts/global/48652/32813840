<p>I'm currently working on a Navigation Drawer where I want the user photo to be scaled, cropped, tinted, then used as the header image behind a circular crop of there picture.</p>  <p>I can't even post images because this account is too low rep...damn me and using my old student account for most of my questions...</p>  <p>Despite my <code>ImageView</code> being defined like this</p>  <pre><code>&lt;ImageView     android:tint="@color/clyp_copy"     android:layout_width="match_parent"     android:layout_height="match_parent"     android:background="@drawable/pixplogo"     android:scaleType="centerCrop"     android:adjustViewBounds="true"/&gt; </code></pre>  <p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/15Ako" rel="nofollow">This image (1) skews like this (2) (Same link, two images)</a></p>  <p>This is actually a common issue for me. I've never gotten <code>centerCrop</code> to work properly. I don't understand why.</p>  <p>Testing on 5.1.1, building on SDK 23. Same issue on 21</p>  <p><a href="http://puu.sh/kqAiY/4a37952996.apk" rel="nofollow">Not sure if this is allowed on SO, but here's a Debug apk...maybe it's just my device...or 5.x</a></p>
