<p>I have a big square drawable image that I want to display in an ImageView that is small since it has to match_parent a LinearLayout in height. I want the image to be resized in width also, keeping the image's aspect ratio. So I have something like</p>  <pre><code>    &lt;LinearLayout        android:layout_width="match_parent"        android:layout_height="wrap_content"        android:orientation="horizontal"&gt;         &lt;ImageView           android:layout_width="wrap_content"           android:layout_height="match_parent"           android:adjustViewBounds="true"           android:src="@drawable/image"/&gt;         &lt;TextView           android:layout_width="wrap_content"           android:layout_height="wrap_content"           android:text="text"/&gt;      &lt;/LinearLayout&gt; </code></pre>  <p>What I expect is that the linearlayout measures the height of the textview, then the imageview gets this height and finally rescales her width to keep image aspect ratio. Instead, the imageview's width doesn't rescale and what I have in the end is an ImageView with the correct height (measured through the textview's height) but the width of the original, not scaled, drawable image. It seems that android:adjustViewBounds="true" isn't working and the width initially set to wrap_content of a not scaled image is kept until the end.</p>  <p>Where I'm wrong? And how to get the ImageView rescaled as I want?</p>
