<p>I have an ImageView that I laid out in XML, but I need to later programmatically add overlay images to the first. I was wondering if there is an easy way to make a new ImageView instance based on one I already have? That way I don't need to reset all the layout constraints and whatnot.</p>  <p>I suspect there isn't a simple way to do this, but I just thought I would throw the question out there.</p>
