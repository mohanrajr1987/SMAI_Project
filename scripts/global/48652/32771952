<p>My question is about this current trend in mobile apps. Whenever you click on a imageview that image goes fullscreen and then you can basically drag it to dismiss, if drag is not sufficient the view goes to its original position. If you are an iPhone user you see this function in most of the app.</p>  <p>For instance, this link shows the twitter example: <a href="http://thenextweb.com/twitter/2015/02/12/twitter-rolling-swipe-dismiss-images/" rel="nofollow">http://thenextweb.com/twitter/2015/02/12/twitter-rolling-swipe-dismiss-images/</a> Facebook's is a lot smoother as they also set transparency of background and so on. First of all, what is this really called? Secondly, is there any library for this purpose because this seems to be widely used, maybe I do not know the terminology or name of the technique.  Is fullscreen image in an activity or in a dialog? (I think it is an activity with translucent theme.) I have been checking Rebound by Facebook, I can scale the image, but I cannot do both scaling and dragging at the same time with it.</p>  <p>Any help or tips are appreciated. Thanks</p>
