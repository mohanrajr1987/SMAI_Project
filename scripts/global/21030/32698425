<p>Recently, I am developing algorithm to improvement the camera calibration algorithm in my research group. I would like to ask are there any method to evaluation the camera calibration algorithm so that  I can compare the result among difference algorithm?  </p>  <p>The most easiest way I can think of is taking the mean square average of different between the calibrated one and the original one pixel-wise. Are there any other suggestions?</p>
