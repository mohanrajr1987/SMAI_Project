<p>I would like to find the intercept of 2 lines in 3D. How can I check if they really intercept withour calculating the the real 3D coorindate at first. And then how can I calculate the 3D coordinates of that particular point?  </p>  <p>Secondly, I understand it is not possible to find intercept points if two lines do not intercept. Thus, I would like to find a way to calculate 3d point which has the minimium distance from both point. I come with two minimium  distance requirements:<br>  1. take the shortest distance connecting two points and take the mid point as my result<br>  2. find the shortest perpendicular distance away from both lines  </p>  <p>Would anyone can give me some tips on it?</p>
