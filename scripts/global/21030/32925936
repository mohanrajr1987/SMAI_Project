<p>I'm working on a content based image retrieval application. Currently, I'm using a simple Bag of Words to represent the images - no spatial information.</p>  <p>My question is, how do I compare the resultant image histograms with each other? For instance, suppose I have a 100 image-histograms in my 'database' (it's really just a dictionary).</p>  <p>Do I simply compute the euclidean distance of my query image's histogram with all of the 100 image-histograms and the image with the lowest distance is the winner?</p>  <p>What other method can I use to improve the speed and accuracy of retrieval?</p>
