<p>I've developed a windows application using C# and OpenCV libraries to process images from a camera connected within my LAN. The application takes images from the camera, processes them and send commands to the cam depending on the results of the proceeding (and also sends alerts email in some cases).</p>  <p>Now i need to run the same application but there isn't any possibility to have a PC in the LAN of the camera. The idea is to install the application in the cloud but i'm pretty new in such themes and i need some advices about how can i do it. My questions are the following:</p>  <p>-Which kind of service should i contract?. I mean, i need windows as operating system and i've seen dedicated services, instances and virtual machines but i have no idea about their pros and cons or even the feasibility of doing what i need.</p>  <p>-Which architecture should i use? I want also to broadcast the video streaming in a personal web but i'll do it outside the current application.</p>  <p>Any advise or guide will be welcome. Thanks in advances!!</p>
