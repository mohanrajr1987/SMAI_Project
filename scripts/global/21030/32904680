<p>I require guidance about auto-IT scripts(scripts that automatically control windows screen on base of scripts written). I need to know the language in which I can create such scripts or pre-made scripts which automatically control screen by detecting opened window and deciding what to do accordingly. I mean to say the product should detect the screen and then decide what to do.</p>
