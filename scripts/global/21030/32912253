<p>I'm having serious problems rectifying stereo images with OpenCV 2.4.9. I get internal and external parameters from bundler and then transformed to OpenMVG's coordinate system (which is same as OpenCV's [<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17987465/how-is-orientated-the-camera-coordinate-system-in-opencv">OpenCV</a>, <a href="http://openmvg.readthedocs.org/en/latest/openMVG/cameras/cameras/" rel="nofollow">openMVG</a>].</p>  <p>I'm running <a href="https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/blob/master/samples/cpp/stereo_match.cpp" rel="nofollow">this</a> c++ sample code.</p>  <p>Rectifying algorithm requires a <code>R</code> (relative rotation) matrix and <code>T</code> (translation between camera centres) vector (which are read from <code>extrinsic_filename</code> file. I'm using following equations to compute <code>R</code> and <code>T</code> matrices.</p>  <pre><code>R = R0' * R1 T = R0 * C1 + T0 &lt;- (C1 in image 0's coordinate system) </code></pre>  <p>where </p>  <pre><code>C0 = -R0' * T0 C1 = -R1' * T1 </code></pre>  <p>Images I want to rectify are taken from drone and are pointed down and have a very similar orientation. Rotation matrix should be near identity. Images are also taken at simmilar height so <code>z</code> component of <code>T</code> should also be near zero.</p>  <p>Camera data and input files (<code>in.yaml</code> and <code>ex.yaml</code>) and  results are available in this <a href="https://gist.github.com/mitjap/f4ba3511926fefe38261" rel="nofollow">gist</a>.</p>  <p>The result I get is not rectified image, but something in between - see gist above for images.</p>  <p>What am I doing wrong? Are my equations wrong? I tried practically all combinations of translations and rotations and multiplications of above matrices (just to be sure) but still no result.</p>
