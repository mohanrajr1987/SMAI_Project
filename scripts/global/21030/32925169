<p>I am trying to count the number of hairs transplanted in the following image. So practically, I have to count the number of spots I can find in the center of image.  (I've uploaded the <em>inverted</em> image of a bald scalp on which new hairs have been transplanted because the original image is bloody and absolutely disgusting! To see the original non-inverted image click <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/aR5VY.jpg" rel="nofollow">here</a>. To see the larger version of the inverted image just click on it). Is there any known image processing algorithm to detect these spots? I've found out that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_Hough_Transform" rel="nofollow">Circle Hough Transform</a> algorithm can be used to find circles in an image, I'm not sure if it's the best algorithm that can be applied to find the small spots in the following image though. Any advice that shed some light on this topic would be highly appreciated! I'm going to use c# to implement the algorithm. </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/jMins.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/jMins.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
