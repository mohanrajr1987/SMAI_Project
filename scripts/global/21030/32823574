<p><strong>Suppose</strong> we have a series of digital images D1,...,Dn. For certainty, we consider this images to be of the same size. The problem is to find the largest common area -- the largest area that all of the input images share.</p>  <p>I suppose that if we have an algorithm to detect such area in two input images A and B, we can generalize it to the case of n images.</p>  <p><strong>The most difficulty</strong> in this problem is that this area in image A doesn't have to be identically, pixel to pixel, equal to the the same area in image B. For example, we take two shots of a building using phone camera. Our hand shook and the second picture turned out to be a little dislodged. And the noise that's present in every picture adds uncertainty as well.</p>  <p>What algorithms should I look into to solve this kind of problem?</p>
