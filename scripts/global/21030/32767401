<p>I am using Apple's CIDetector class to try and detect rectangles from a still image.</p>  <p>But the recognition seems to be very off, even with a photo that has been heavily processed to make it obvious.</p>  <p>Here is the source image I am feeding it: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ah41jetq259k431/Screenshot%202015-09-24%2013.21.26.png?dl=0" rel="nofollow">https://www.dropbox.com/s/ah41jetq259k431/Screenshot%202015-09-24%2013.21.26.png?dl=0</a></p>  <p>And here is what CIDetector thinks is the rectangle: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/28k5pyyya2xg8vt/Screenshot%202015-09-24%2002.21.51.png?dl=0" rel="nofollow">https://www.dropbox.com/s/28k5pyyya2xg8vt/Screenshot%202015-09-24%2002.21.51.png?dl=0</a></p>  <p>I have the accuracy setting on max, specified a very good estimate of aspect ratio. </p>
