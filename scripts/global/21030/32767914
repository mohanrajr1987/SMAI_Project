<p>I'll have a lot of X-Ray images of trucks moving through a X-Ray scanner at the speed 40 km/h. The goal is to remove the truck per se from a scan and leave only cargo so that operators could easier detect threats and forbidden items in cargo.</p>  <p>My initial thought was to use neural networks to detect which truck among seen earlier is closest to one just being scanned. If the closest is still far-away, I'd add this current one to 'seen before' as a new. If not, subtract from the scan of the current truck the most similar truck so we get only cargo as a result. One problem is that it's not clear yet how to remove cargo from a truck just added to the model. In addition, there are too many types of truck, so performance may be unsatisfactory.</p>  <p>Would ideas on how to solve this task would you suggest? Or on what resource on the internet can I find help?</p>
