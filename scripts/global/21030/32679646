<p>The OpenCV function <code>findHomography</code> "finds a perspective transformation between two planes". According to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25693683/output-of-cv2-findhomography-in-opencv-python">this post</a>, if <code>H</code> is the transformation matrix, we have (where <code>X1</code> is the prior image):</p>  <pre><code>X1 = H Â· X2 </code></pre>  <p>I am struggling to fully comprehend the reference axes of the parameters in the transformation (translation distances, scaling factors and rotation angle -in a simplified affine transformation case without shear-). </p>  <p>What I am trying to obtain is the camera motion from one image to another, relative to the first image. That is, motion between images expressed as the <strong>translation in the first image's axes</strong>. I assume these translations are the (tx,ty) from the homography matrix, but <strong>corrected using the rotation angle and scaling</strong> parameters. Could someone enlighten me on how to obtain these translation values?</p>
