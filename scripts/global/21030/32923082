<p>I am implementing Lowe's method, "SIFT", for finding and describing features in an image.</p>  <p>I have found interest points, and now I have to describe them: Using Lowe's method, I have calculated the magnitude and gradient in an area around the keypoint, and created a Gauss weighted histogram, with 36 bins, each corresponding to an orientation of 10 degrees. For each keypoint, there is a histogram. Each bin is the sum of the weighted magnitude, in that direction. An example taken from aishack.in: <a href="http://www.aishack.in/static/img/tut/sift-orientation-histogram.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.aishack.in/static/img/tut/sift-orientation-histogram.jpg</a></p>  <p>Bins within 80% the size of the maximum bin, is made a new keypoint. After describing, it says in the paper: "Finally, a parabola is fit to the 3 histogram values closest to each peak to interpolate the peak position for better accuracy". I am not sure i get this. </p>  <p>In my understanding, it means the peak, the left, and the right value of that peak, will have a parabola fit, like this(be warned! Drawn free hand)</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/7V8pb.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i.stack.imgur.com/7V8pb.jpg</a></p>  <p>and the orientation of the keypoint will be where the extremum of the parabola  is. For instance: If the parabola fitted at 10-19, 20-29, and 30-39 (with 20-29 being the histogram peak), had extremum at a point, that reached in the 30-39, then this would be the orientation of that keypoint. Am i understanding this correctly? In this way, the orientation of the keypoint, can only be within 36 orientations</p>  <p>Another option: Same idea as above, only the histogram is no longer discrete: the extremum of the parapola will thus be a continuous value, and this value is assigned to the keypoint.</p>
