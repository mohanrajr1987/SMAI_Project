<p>I have a binary image and I'm looking for a robust way to find the lines in the shape and the topology (how the lines connect).</p>  <p>I have experimented in matlab (although what I'm asking for is which methods to use).</p>  <p>I've tried using skeletonization on the binary image and then used hough-transform, works sometimes but not a robust solution. I struggled with boundary disturbance.</p>  <p>Could anyone point me in a direction of which methods to use here (and in what order).</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/CJnHa.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/CJnHa.png" alt="Start (binary image)"></a> <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/1L7IS.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/1L7IS.png" alt="End result I want"></a></p>  <p><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10700891/bw.mat" rel="nofollow">Binary file for testing</a></p>
