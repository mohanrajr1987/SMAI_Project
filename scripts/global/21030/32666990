<p>As I´ve looked for a way to create an addon, which checks the WoW-PvP-Queue-Status, for creating a REST service, I was told that it`s not possible to have a real-time connection between an addon and a REST service. So I was thinking about another way to solve my problem and came to the point, where I thought about analyzing the WoW-Window and searching for a visual pattern to accomplish for what I´m looking for.  My program should check and tell me, whenever a user of the program is queuing for an battleground and should also tell me on which battleground he/she is queuing, so I can gather the data and post it to my service/website. I could create some visual feedback with an WoW-Addon, for the events I´m looking for ... like a signal, which tells my program what to do.</p>  <p>So I´d like to know, how I would accomplish to create such signal-interpreter( so like an Screen Grabber). I was thinking about OpenCV, but dont know where to start, especially I´m kinda curious in how Warden(Anti Cheat Engine) would interpret such program, I really don`t want my users to get banned for such a thing. It should really just interpret visual feedback of the addon I´d create.</p>  <p>So for example:</p>  <p>If user queues for Arathi Basin, a yellow signal should pop and if the yellow signal pops up, the program tells my service that player xyz has queued up, which should be displayed later on ... on my homepage in real-time. If the user queues up for Warsong, another signal pops up, etc.</p>  <p>I´m currently just experienced with C#/.NET in an early stage and would start a little project with such an service, so what I need to learn to get this thing build up?</p>  <p>I really just would love to have a little guide on which knowledge I need, to solve this problem.</p>
