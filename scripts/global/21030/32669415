<p>The OpenCV library provides a function that returns a set of contours for a binary (thresholded) image. The contourArea() can be applied to find associated areas.</p>  <p>Is the list of contours out outputted by findContours() ordered in terms of area by default? If not, <strong>does anyone know of a cv2 function that orders a list of contours by area?</strong> </p>  <p>Please provide responses in Python, not C.</p>
