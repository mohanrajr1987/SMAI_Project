<p>I have troubles with this kind of images in my implementation of ZS alghorithm:</p>  <pre><code>........ .xx..... ..xx.... ...xx... ....xx.. .....xx. ......x. ........ </code></pre>  <p>from description of algorithm(<a href="http://www.ppgia.pucpr.br/~facon/Afinamento/1984ZhangSuen.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ppgia.pucpr.br/~facon/Afinamento/1984ZhangSuen.pdf</a>) we need to perform two subiterations iteratively. After first subiteration I get the result below("," is a pixel set as background):</p>  <pre><code>........ .,x..... ..xx.... ...xx... ....xx.. .....xx. ......,. ........ </code></pre>  <p>Result after secong subiteration ("-" is a pixel set as background):</p>  <pre><code>........ .,-..... ..xx.... ...xx... ....xx.. .....x-. ......,. ........ </code></pre>  <p>And as you can see I get the same kind of structure of pixels but smaller than in input image:</p>  <pre><code>........ ........ ..xx.... ...xx... ....xx.. .....x.. ........ ........ </code></pre>  <p>After n iterations result is only two pixels. But It isn't good structure for this example as I think. I ask you is it a specific of ZS alghorithm or I have a wrong understanding of it. Thanks.</p>
