<p>I am working on Content Based Image Retrieval on a video. The constraint is it should work in real time. Now the first step is to sample the video. Now usually across some frames scenes are repetitive, so I thought I can sample video after a certain frame where the scene is relatively "different". That means neglect the frames which are "similar" to the frame last sampled. </p>  <p>Now I am confused on how to measure this difference and once difference is defined, what should be threshold to decide whether a frame is different or not from the last sampled frame?</p>
