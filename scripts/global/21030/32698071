<p>So I am trying to write some code that lets me segment the fuses you see in the picture below. I have come up with two approaches:</p>  <p>1) Based on color. I threshold using OpenCV's inRange function. This approach works well for all fuses except the brown fuse. The brown fuse it too similar in colour with the fusebox itself and therefore it's very hard to segment it out.</p>  <p>2) I considered thresholding the image heavily so that I can detect the white points/terminals on the fuses themselves using OpenCV SimpleBlobDetector. I then filter out the blobs by their distances to each other. As I know the size of the fuses, I can filter out the invalid fuses. This approach works well for all fuses but the white one as it appears in even the most thresholded images.</p>  <p>I was hoping I could get a pointer on how to segment such an image. Would background subtraction work?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/LoZmX.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/LoZmX.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
