<p>I am getting image from Leopard Imaging M021 camera in Matlab. Each frame is of size 720x1280x3. The video object shows the image is being extracted in YUY2 manner. Same was told by Leopard imaging support. They said that the Camera sends out RAW image of 12bits with higher 4bits 0. Now when I got the image in Matlab. I am not able to interpret the three matrices of dimensions 1280x720. I need to convert that Matrix into RAW RGB. Please help. </p>  <p>If I display the image in MATLAB it looks green if i use imshow command</p>
