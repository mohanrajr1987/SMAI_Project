<p>I'm using OpenCV's findContours() to output a list of functions upon which I want to make some comparisons. The application of this function is straightforward (<a href="http://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.org/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_imgproc/py_contours/py_contour_features/py_contour_features.html" rel="nofollow">http://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.org/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_imgproc/py_contours/py_contour_features/py_contour_features.html</a>). However, my desire to work more creatively with the outputted set of contours is hindered by difficulty finding documentation on the structure of the function's output.</p>  <p>Given a binary (thresholded) image, findContours outputs the original image, contours (seemingly an array of 2-dimensional matrices with (x,y) coordinates for contour vertices), and a "hierarchy". <strong>What is the nature of this hierarchy? Are the individual contours given some type of identifiers? How can I reference an element of the array for comparison (e.g., contours[1])?</strong></p>
