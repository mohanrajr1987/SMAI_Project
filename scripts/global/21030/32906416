<p>I need to implement the Viola Jones algorithm and I don't  understand something. I found the algorithm here with 5 features: <a href="http://www.ipol.im/pub/art/2014/104/article.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ipol.im/pub/art/2014/104/article.pdf</a> and I am stuck in algorithm 3 page 5.</p>  <p>I didn't understand what a,K,J and w mean there and how to make it a code. Also there is something wierd in the return <code>a &lt;-2wh</code> in the first line and them return <code>(s1-s2)*a/(2wh)</code> so what's the meaning of using <code>a</code> ?</p>  <p>It will be awesome if someone can explain a little bit about this and how to make it a vector for the machine learning.</p>  <p>edit:</p>  <p>If I wasn't clear, I just want a summary of the viola jones algorithem in this web I wrote here. thanks for the help and sorry if I wasn't clear.</p>
