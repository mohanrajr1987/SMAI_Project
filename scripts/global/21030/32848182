<p>I have four cameras, mounted on a steel plate in a square pattern (two rows of two). I would like to calibrate these cameras to determine the intrinsic parameters, and the relative positions of the camera. I can obtain the intrinsic parameters using openCV's calibrateCamera.</p>  <p>Typically I would use stereoCalibrate for calibration of two cameras. I could do the same here, but I would prefer a more scalable solution.</p>  <p>My question is, how do I stereoCalibrate more that two cameras, with the known constraint that they are all mounted on the same plane? One option is to solvePnP, but this ignores the planar constraint.</p>
