<p>I have a stereo camera rig. I have captured a chessboardPattern sequence (the same sequence, two pictures per exposure). I have performed a single camera calibration on the individual cameras using cv2.calibrateCamera.</p>  <p>My question is, is running a cv2.stereoCalibrate on both cameras redundant, given that calibrateCamera has provided me with object-relative position and orientation of the individual cameras? If not, what benefits does it provide me with?</p>
