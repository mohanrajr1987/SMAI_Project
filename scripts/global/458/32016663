<p>Is there a good framework available for Xcode/Swift 1.2 that supports automated property based testing? Specifically, something that has a nice framework of Generator-style classes/tools that can create a large number of test values, across a defined range?</p>  <p>Example, I'd like to test email addresses. I'd like to have a class that generates, say, 1,000+ random emails that range from simple ASCII all the way up to complex Unicode, but fitting within the email pattern.</p>  <p>With ScalaCheck this is pretty easy. I haven't found a library that is similar in Swift...</p>
