<p>I am wondering if you guys do unit test your controllers and if it is common practise in a TDD environment.</p>  <p>What I have are <strong>skinny controllers</strong> that basically call on to the <strong>business layer</strong> for logic and data and then <strong>populate a local ViewModel</strong> to pass to the view.</p>  <p>I do unit test the business layer but I wonder if testing these skinny controllers still make sense or its really not necessary unless you have a fat controller with a lot of logic in it.</p>  <p>Please let me know your thoughts.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
