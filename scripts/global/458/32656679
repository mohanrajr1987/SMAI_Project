<p>When testing a Windows Universal class library (.NET 4.6) in Visual Studio 2015, the time required in the "red->green->refactor" cycle is quite long. My test project is just the standard MSTest "Unit Test App" project. Even in the simplest scenario of a brand new solution, brand new subject and test projects, and a basic <code>int Add(int n1, int n2)</code> method, it's taking about 8-15 seconds. This is the time (after making a small code change) from clicking "run test" till the pass/fail is shown.</p>  <p>On my machine (Win 10 pro) conducting the same experiment but with a WPF-based solution yields about 1-2 seconds.</p>  <p>In the UWP scenario, the actual test time itself is listed as 79 ms. The rest of the time is compiling and deploying the unit test app container.</p>  <p>Is there any way to significantly speed up TDD with UWP? </p>
