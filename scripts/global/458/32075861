<p>I have experience in Ruby, and TDD using Rspec to a decent extent, largely for back end unit testing.</p>  <p>I have recently begun to learn the theory behind testing, including some new concepts; <code>Drivers</code> and <code>Stubs</code>.</p>  <p>The definitions of these terms seem to vary online, and just confuse more than they help.</p>  <p>From what I can understand stubs are doubles in Rspec? Not sure where to place drivers?</p>  <p>Can anyone shed any light on this?</p>
