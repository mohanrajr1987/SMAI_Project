<p>I am experimenting with React + Relay + Graphql these days. Unfortunately, I cannot find any easy and convenient way to test React component wrapped by Relay Container.</p>  <p>Basically, I would like to achieve these goals along TDD,</p>  <ol> <li>Render a container and test its content,</li> <li>Change variables and test its changes on content.</li> </ol>  <p>Compared with React + Flux, React + Relay is more like black box, or, declarative.</p>  <p>I can see people mock Relay.createContainer to bypass Relay and merely test React Component. It leaves the Relay part uncovered and there is no way to <em>drive</em> this part by testing. <a href="https://github.com/facebook/relay/issues/161" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/facebook/relay/issues/161</a></p>  <p>Also, I read through test cases of Relay and its really tedious to render a mock container. <a href="https://github.com/facebook/relay/blob/master/src/tools/__mocks__/RelayTestUtils.js" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/facebook/relay/blob/master/src/tools/<strong>mocks</strong>/RelayTestUtils.js</a></p>  <p>I will be really grateful if you can share you solution.</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
