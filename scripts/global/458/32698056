<p>I want to start using Infinitest for continuous integration at the developer level, so far it's the only one that does a little of what I want, which is scream at me when I make changes to tests that fail without having to MANUALLY run the test. </p>  <p>The problem is, my file structure and project is huge and have crazy dependencies (whether this is a sign of poor design or not I have no control over, I must deal with it for now). If I run the tests conventionally via intellij it works fine and passes, but when infinitest runs it gets errors like "could not initialize   <p>My question is is there anyting in infinitest.args or anything that I can get it to run correctly? Also are there better  / similar alternatives? Infinitest has a great idea but the small details aren't hashed out. Any help would be nice, thanks!</p>
