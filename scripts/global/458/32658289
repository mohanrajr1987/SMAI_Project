<p>Belonging to the world of web development, I am used to powerful testing techniques and tools like Chai, Sinon, Mocha, Jasmine, to name a few, as well as to wide support and community, well-written books with deep insights. There are all possible cases I can imagine that are covered with existing tools.</p>  <p>Now, learning iOS development with Swift, I wonder, how I can thoroughly test methods of my app using stubs and mocks, imitating connecting to web services asynchronously and get myself sure tests can be written in a clear manner, creating peace of mind for my aging body.</p>  <p>I find the community is not so wide in iOS development, especially, Swift, as a result of the language being not so long on the landscape.</p>  <p>Please share the best practices for testing that can help me to create solid predictably behaving apps.</p>
