<p>Let's say I'm testing my code and I have designed 5 functions to to 5 different things. The data function_a() returns is passed to function_b()... ect all the way to function_e(). See below.</p>  <pre><code>var1 = function_a() var2 = function_b(var1) ... var5 = function_e(var4) </code></pre>  <p>So all of these functions are fairly interdependent and reliant on the data from the previous function.</p>  <p>How do I test this properly? Five assertions in a single test seems like a code smell to me, but according to the accepted answer <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21447740/persist-variable-changes-between-tests-in-unittest">here</a> passing data between separate tests (which would be necessary here I think) is a bit of a code smell.</p>
