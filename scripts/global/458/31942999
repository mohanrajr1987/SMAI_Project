<p>Firstly I understand you write tests firstly in order to fail so that they give you adequate information on how to make them pass and what will make them fail if I'm correct.Then after they pass you write the actual code and then tests to test the actual code and then if that passed you're finished.</p>  <p>(If I'm wrong in any part of the above please tell me I've only just started reading up on this)</p>  <p><strong>1. Once your starting tests pass , do you delete them or keep them in     code (The same goes for the actual tests)</strong></p>  <p><strong>2. Also is RSpec (for rails) the right way to do testing</strong></p>  <p>(If you have any resources to point me to about TDD with rails that would help aswell) Currently I'm looking at this: <a href="http://everydayrails.com/2012/04/07/testing-series-rspec-controllers.html" rel="nofollow">http://everydayrails.com/2012/04/07/testing-series-rspec-controllers.html</a></p>
