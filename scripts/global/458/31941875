<p>Sorry for the generic question, but is a doubt about the TDD. The TDD says first a create test case and after this write the code. But I have a difficult to follow this steps. I mean for create a code from scratch, firstly I do an outline of how will the relationship of objects, and after this in theory I start with the test, but for me is a little difficult to abstract everything I need to write in test.</p>  <p>Sorry if this is a dumb question, but what you do for create test first? You make a list of all behavior you will test before really start to write test, or something else?</p>
