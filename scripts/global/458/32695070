<p>I am looking for running test on a project which use :</p>  <ul> <li>browserify <em>with these transform</em> :  <ul> <li>babelify</li> <li>reactify</li> </ul></li> </ul>  <p>I did try the combo JSDOM + Mocha but testing a component which has not been builded yet will fail on require call from a component to another :</p>  <pre><code>&gt; mocha --compilers js:babel/register --recursive  module.js:338     throw err;     ^ Error: Cannot find module 'system/services/AuthService' </code></pre>  <p>I think I need to run mocha test during the gulp build watchify and build tasks. I am not sure if handling the test during the build process is a good option.</p>  <p>Normaly, after a successful build I have a file in <code>client/build/js/bundle.js</code> in ES5.</p>  <p>I want to be able to test my component using the ES6 file which require a browserify for being readble by my testing lib.</p>  <p>Does anyone could provide me a good option, with some npm modules or anything that could help me achieve TDD in my environment ?</p>
