<h3>Context</h3>  <p>I have a framework that I'm building where I'm separating out different parts into their own gems. I'm doing this for two reasons:</p>  <ol> <li>Make it easier for me to know what's going on in each one, and focus on just what's going on in the component</li> <li>Make it so you can include only individual components and the minimum code required is loaded</li> </ol>  <hr>  <h3>Question</h3>  <p>I want to make sure my new components don't break old ones. How can I run tests from other gems? Is there a better way to solve this that I'm not thinking of?</p>  Example:  <p>Two components, one that deals with the <code>file system</code>, the other one with <code>ftp</code> via the <code>file system</code>. When I introduce <code>ftp</code> I don't want to break <code>file system</code>, and therefore want to run tests for both.</p>
