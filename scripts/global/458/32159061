<p>I have a function that should return one of three values (Let's say 'A', 'B' or 'C'). I want to verify that when this function has been called the return value is one of those things.</p>  <p>If I were writing this as a test in a Python TestCase I might use syntax like:</p>  <pre><code>self.assertIn(myFn(), {'A', 'B', 'C'}) </code></pre>  <p>The first argumet is the function I'm trying to test. The second argument is a set containing the valid answers. All I want to do is assert that the output of myFn() needs to be one of these three specified values. Anything else should cause the test to fail.</p>  <p>But what's the Chai equivalent of this statement? </p>  <p>Chai is a JavaScript assertions library. I'm not asking how to do this in Python (since I've actually given valid Python syntax in this question). Your answer should be valid JavaScript (or CoffeeScript), which shows the Chai syntax which is equivalent to the Python syntax in this question.</p>
