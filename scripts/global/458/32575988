<p>I'm in chapter 7 of Michael Hartl's Rails Tutorial and I'm having a hard time understanding the "_path"s that he calls on for a particular test (section 7.3.4 to be exact). Here's the code in question:  </p>  <pre><code>require 'test_helper'  class UsersSignupTest &lt; ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest    test "invalid signup information" do     get signup_path     assert_no_difference 'User.count' do       post users_path, user: { name:  "",                            email: "user@invalid",                            password:              "foo",                            password_confirmation: "bar" }     end     assert_template 'users/new'   end end </code></pre>  <p>In particular, I'm confused about <code>get signup_path</code> and <code>post users_path</code>. When I go back and search the book for <code>signup_path</code>, Table 5.1 indicates it is the named route for <code>[sample_app url]/signup</code> which should direct visitors to the signup page of the website. Additionally, when I search the book for <code>users_path</code>, Table 7.1 indicates that it is the named route for <code>[sample_app url]/users</code> using the 'create' controller action because we are issuing a <code>POST</code> HTTP request.    </p>  <p>NOTE: In responses, <strong>please</strong> don't suggest altering this code. This is based on Hartl's Rails Tutorial and the assumption is that the code is correct and should work <em>as is</em>. Please make sure your answers explain the code I've posted (or other code from his tutorial) and not modifications to the existing code.</p>  <p><strong>EDIT:</strong> OK, so I think I can see the difference between <code>signup_path</code> and <code>users_path</code>: in the routes.rb file, /signup routes to <code>users#new</code>, which means it is routed to the users controller and specifically the 'new' method of that controller. I know the result of this is loading the new.html.erb file. Part of what I don't get is -- <strong>how does the users#new controller action know which HTML page to load? Does the 'new' method automatically call whichever view is also called 'new'? OR...</strong> (Here's the relevant controller code for the new method: </p>  <pre><code>def new   @user = User.new end </code></pre>  <p>The other part of my problem is with users_path: <code>rake routes</code> says the POST method for /users is routes through the users#create controller/action. But my routes.rb file doesn't have a route to reflect this:  </p>  <pre><code>Rails.application.routes.draw do   root                'static_pages#home'   get '/help' =&gt;      'static_pages#help'    get '/about' =&gt;     'static_pages#about'   get '/contact' =&gt;   'static_pages#contact'   get '/signup' =&gt;    'users#new'   resources :users end  </code></pre>  <p>So the second part of the question is: <strong>How does the routes file know to route the post users_path to the users#create controller/action?</strong></p>
