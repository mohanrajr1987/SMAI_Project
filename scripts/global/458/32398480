<p>I am new to testing and I have a question.</p>  <p>This code tests if that route is correct, ok?</p>  <pre><code>test "root should route to home#index" do assert_routing "/", {controller: "home", action: "index"} end </code></pre>  <p>How can I test the opposite? I have </p>  <pre><code>resources :sessions, :only=&gt;[:new, :create, :destroy] </code></pre>  <p>In my routes. How would I test that you can't enter sessions#edit?</p>  <p>Could it be that I should not test that?</p>  <p>EDIT: I forgot to mention it, I'm using the default tools.</p>
