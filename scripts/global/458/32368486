In my <em>Automation frameworks</em> I used to simply automate the manual test cases and the manual efforts of testers. </p>  <p>Now I have been assigned a Task where i need to develop the <em>Automation Framework</em> using <em>Behavioral Driven Development</em>.</p>  <p><em>What are the things I should know before i start BDD in Automation frameworks</em> </p>  <p>&amp; </p>  <p><em>What will make my framework different from my previous frameworks?</em> </p>
