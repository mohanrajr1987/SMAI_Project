<p>I'm trying to run a feature file like this:</p>  <pre><code>Feature: my feature  Background:   When I do something   And I choose from a &lt;list&gt;  Scenario Outline: choice A   And I click on &lt;something&gt; after the choice A is clicked  Examples:   | list | something |   |  a   |   1  |   |  b   |   2  |   |  c   |   3  | </code></pre>  <p>But what happens is when the second Background step runs, in the step definition, <code>list</code> is a String with the value <code>&lt;list&gt;</code>, and the first Scenario line <code>something</code> is <code>1</code>, so can Background not use the variables from Examples? Putting a copy of Examples before Scenario Outline does not work. </p>
