<p>I'm trying to use <a href="http://docs.mockery.io" rel="nofollow">Mockery</a> and <a href="http://phpunit.de" rel="nofollow">PHPUnit</a> to test if one method OR another method of a given class will be called when some piece of code is executed.</p>  <p>This is exactly what I'm trying to do (I'm using Laravel 5):</p>  <pre><code>// Test an email is sent to new user // upon account creation. public function testEmailSentOnNewUserCreation() {     // Mail can be sent right on ...     Mail::shouldReceive('send')-&gt;once(); //...OR...     // ... it can be queued for later.     Mail::shouldReceive('queue')-&gt;once();     // I'm ignoring parameters and returning values here     // for sake of brevity.      $u = new User;     $u-&gt;name = 'Jon Doe';     $u-&gt;email = 'jon@doe.com';     $u-&gt;save(); } </code></pre>  <p>So, my question is about how to implement the OR part, if it's possible. I also searched for some PHPUnit annotation that could be helpful, but I couldn't find anything.</p>
