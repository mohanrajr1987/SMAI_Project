<p>We have a Junit test suite that is run using jenkins. When one or some of the tests continue to run longer than expected, jenkins times aborts the job after a certain period of time. I have seen people asking questions on how to time out tests, but my question is more on what is the right way to handle timeout issues? at jenkins level? or at the framework level? or at the individual test level?</p>
