<p>The version of my JDK is <strong>7.0</strong>.<br> The version of my Eclipse is <strong>eclipse-jee-mars-R-win32-x86_64</strong>.<br> The version of JUnit is 4.4.</p>  <p>My code is as follows:</p>  <pre><code>package nn;  import org.junit.Test;  public class Ofin {         @Test        public  void  show(){            System.out.println("cx");        }          @Test        public  void  show2(){            System.out.println("cx2");        }        } </code></pre>  <hr>  <p>My question is that when I select the name of a method (for example select <code>show</code>) and run JUnit test, Eclipse throws <code>NullPointerException</code>.</p>  <p>However, when I select the name of method <strong>and its brackets</strong> (for example selecting <code>show()</code>) it is ok, I can see the result on console. But why?</p>  <p>My code is so simple that it can't have a syntactic error. I use older version of Eclipse, but versions in years after 2014 all have this problem.</p>
