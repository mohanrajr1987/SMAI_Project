<p>How are you?</p>  <p>I'm starting with selenium, and I'm trying hard to deal with <strong><em>"AssertTrue (boolean condition)"</em></strong>, but there's something wrong.</p>  <p>I need the Junit gets green(ok) if I access successfully one page, and I want it get red(nok) if it's not possible to access.</p>  <p>But all I got is Green, every single time!</p>  <p>For example:  If I access the payment page it's ok (I assert that there's a buy button to be sure is the payment page) If I try to access without being logged then the system displays an error message (If I do not find that buy button I won't be in the payment page)</p>  <p>So here's what I'm trying to do in the end of my public boolean method:</p>  <p>"</p>  <pre><code> if(buybutton.isDisplayed()){             return true;         } else {             return false;} </code></pre>  <p>"</p>  <p>So in my test class I'm trying to assert:</p>  <p><strong><em>Shoes</strong> is what I'm buying, and the <strong>Shoeslink.com</strong> is where I can find it. I put this two variables there because there's an <strong>IF</strong> - if the user wants to buy shoes selenium will expect some elements, if is a shirt selenium will expect others. But I guess it doesn't matter, because the assert is defined by the code I put above, right? And below is the assertcode I'm talking about:</em></p>  <pre><code>assertTrue(buy.AccessProduct("**Shoes**", "**Shoeslink.com**")); </code></pre>  <p>Well, if you guys have another logic or way to do it, that's all I need by now: A successfull test if I find an element or an error test if I don't. </p>  <p>Thank you!</p>
