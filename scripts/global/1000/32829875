<p>I am a automation test developer, I use selenium + page object model + Junit for doing my tests. Which leads me to a problem, in every single test class I declare attributes like these:</p>  <pre><code>By miscellaneousContainerFinder = By.cssSelector(".MISCELLANEOUS_ROW"); By goodbyeTextContainerFinder = By.cssSelector(".GOOD_BYE_TEXT_ROW"); By driversBarriersContainerFinder = By.cssSelector(".DRIVERS_BARRIERS_ROW"); </code></pre>  <p>But much more attributes, 15-20 of these. What gives me a headache is that I need to create for each of these "By's" simple methods, such as:</p>  <pre><code>    public String getEmailComment() {          try {             return descriptionTabContainer.findElement(emailCommentFinder).getText();         } catch (NoSuchElementException e) {             return null;         }     } </code></pre>  <p>or methods that clicks, or types in a WebElement. So I thought about the way eclipse can generate getters/setters for the attributes, I know that I can edit the way these codes are generated, and insert any code that I'd like. But how can I add new methods specifying also the name they will have and the return? </p>  <p>I'd like to have the option to generate methods like these - generate getter/setter, generate clickMethod, generate sendKeys method, generate getText method.</p>  <p>Is this possible or am I dreaming?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
