<p>I'm using rest-assured library for the API tests and it seems like a new cookie can't be set. I can however modify the cookie which is set by the server.</p>  <pre><code>given()   .cookie("cookie1", "true")   .get(url)   .then()   .assertThat().cookie("cookie1", "true"); // Fails with "Cookie "cookie1" was not // defined in the response. Cookies are: cookie2=true, cookie3=true   given()   .cookie("cookie2", "false")   .get(url)   .then()   .assertThat().cookie("cookie2", "false"); // PASS </code></pre>
