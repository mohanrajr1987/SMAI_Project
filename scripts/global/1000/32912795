<p>I keep running into this error when using javac to try to compile a test file (using windows 10 and git bash) and it's driving me insane. I have these lines in my <code>~/.bash_profile</code>:</p>  <pre><code>CS61B_FOLDER="${HOME}/cs61b" export PATH="${CS61B_FOLDER}/cs61b-software/bin:${PATH}" export CLASSPATH=".:${CS61B_FOLDER}/cs61b-software/lib/*" </code></pre>  <p>This is the address that contains JUnit:</p>  <pre><code>C:\Users\Vinay\cs61b\cs61b-software\lib </code></pre>  <p>This is what I have under the system environment variable for CLASSPATH:</p>  <pre><code>%USERPROFILE%\cs61b-software\lib\*;. </code></pre>  <p>Does anyone know why it's not recognizing JUnit?</p>
