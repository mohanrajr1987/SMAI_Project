<p>Here is the method I have defined that is supposed to accept a String as input and should return the number of times the char 'e' occurs as an int:</p>  <pre><code>public int count_e(String input){     int count = 0;     for (int i = 0;i&lt;input.length();i++){         char e = 'e';         if (input.charAt(i)==e){             count=count+1;             i++;             return count;         }         else{             count=count+1;             i++;         }     }     return count; } </code></pre>  <p>}</p>  <p>I am trying to write a JUnit test to see if I can input a string into the method and return the correct number of e's. Below is my test, and at the moment I keep getting an error saying that my method count_e is undefined for type String.</p>  <p>Can someone tell me why it is coming up as undefined?</p>  <pre><code>@Test public void testCount_e() {     String input= "Isabelle";     int expected= 2;     int actual=input.count_e();     assertTrue("There are this many e's in the String.",expected==actual); } </code></pre>  <p>}</p>
