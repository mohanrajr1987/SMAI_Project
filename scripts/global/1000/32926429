<p>I am creating a row of Filters in and Excel using Apache hssf like this:</p>  <pre><code>CellRangeAddress cellRangeAddress = new CellRangeAddress(0,rowNum, 0, colNum); sheet.setAutoFilter(cellRangeAddress); </code></pre>  <p>I am then trying to read the Workbook returned in a JUnit test case to make sure that the data I put into it is where it should be. How do I verify that the the filter exists?</p>  <p>Ideally, I want to do something like this:</p>  <pre><code>String[] filters cellOrRowOrSheetObject.getFilterValuesAsStringArray(firstHeaderCell); //not a real method assertEquals(2, filters.length); assertTrue("LastLineValue", filters[1]); </code></pre>  <p>However just checking that the filters were created would be fine like so:</p>  <pre><code>Object cellvalue = cell.getAllDataAsObject(); //not a real method assertTrue(cellvalue instanceof FilterClass); </code></pre>  <p>Even checking that there is something in the cell that is not in a regular text cell would be a good start.</p>
