<p>I'm developing a Mac app that will be released outside the Mac App Store.</p>  <p>So, basically I just automated the build process: it builds the app and signs the .app file with a Mac Dev ID.<br> If I sign this app with my credentials it works as expected. Either in my machine or my peers machine.<br> But, if my peer signs it with his credentials (using the same scripts), the app crashes either in his machine or mine. This is the error from the Console:</p>  <pre><code>6/27/14 3:04:39.647 PM taskgated[1807]: none of the 1 applicable provisioning profile(s) apply 6/27/14 3:04:39.647 PM taskgated[1807]: killed com.myCompany.myApp[pid 2255] because its use of the com.apple.developer.team-identifier entitlement is not allowed 6/27/14 3:04:39.648 PM com.apple.launchd.peruser.501[286]: ([0x0-0x117117].com.myCompany.myApp[2255]) Exited: Killed: 9 6/27/14 3:04:39.719 PM CoreServicesUIAgent[2258]: Error: qtn_file_apply_to_path error: Read-only file system 6/27/14 3:04:42.021 PM CoreServicesUIAgent[2258]: Unable to continue stopped application -- error -600 </code></pre>  <p>What are we doing wrong? and how can we solve it?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
