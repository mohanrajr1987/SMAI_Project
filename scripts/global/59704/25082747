<p>I recently received the source code for an app built in 2013 (last year).  However, when I try to run it, I receive 3 warnings:</p>  <pre><code>ld: warning: directory not found for option '-L/Users/chesteryeum/iOS/appName/appName_chester'  ld: warning: directory not found for option '-L/Users/chesteryeum/iOS/appName/appName_chester/ZBarSDK'  ld: warning: directory not found for option '-F/Users/chesteryeum/iOS/appName/appName_chester' </code></pre>  <p>And one error</p>  <pre><code>ld: library not found for -lzbar clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation) </code></pre>  <p>A few extra points:</p>  <p>1) chesteryeum is the name of the previous developer, and /Users/chesteryeum is not on my computer, or locatable in finder.</p>  <p>2) Other Linker Flags is empty, Framework Search Paths is empty, Library Search Paths is empty.</p>  <p>3) It seems like the app was built in xCode 4, whereas I am using xCode 5.</p>  <p>Any help would be appreciated,</p>  <p>Thanks in advance,</p>  <p>-Nick</p>  <p>Update:  The 3 warnings have been fixed by the answer by Droppy, but the error still remains.</p>
