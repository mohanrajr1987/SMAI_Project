<p>I've got a Uicollectionview with about 800 cells in it which is very slow when scrollign or zooming in or out. </p>  <p>The Method updateVisibleCellsNow takes about 9000 ms and slows down the App.</p>  <p>I still set</p>  <pre><code>cell.layer.shouldRasterize = YES; cell.layer.rasterizationScale = [UIScreen mainScreen].scale; </code></pre>  <p>But it didn't work at all.</p>  <p>So i've tried to cache all the cells at viewDidLoad, cache them in an NSCache and access them from the cahce, but it seams like I am forced to user a reuseIdentifiert and can't access created Cells from the cache.</p>  <p>Is there any solution for this problem?</p>  <p>greetings,</p>  <p>Alex</p>
