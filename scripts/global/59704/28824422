I deleted the app and then reinstalled it as per the suggestion given in the link:</p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28231338/ios-app-the-application-could-not-be-verified-only-on-one-device">iOS app &#39;The application could not be verified&#39; only on one device</a></p>  <p>I want to know that what might be the actual cause of this error message. !!</p>
