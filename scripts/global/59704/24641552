<p>I have a project that builds and runs fine on Xcode 4.6.3.  But it does not on Xcode 5.1.1. </p>  <p>This is the unique error I get, hundred times. </p>  <p>"ISO C++11 does not allow access declarations; use using declarations instead".  </p>  <p>Basically it wants me to go from:  </p>  <blockquote> <pre><code>typedef Something&lt;MType&gt;::Index Index;     Something&lt;MType&gt;::N; </code></pre> </blockquote>  <p>to</p>  <blockquote> <pre><code>typedef Something&lt;MType&gt;::Index Index;     using Something&lt;MType&gt;::N; </code></pre> </blockquote>  <p>Why is it?</p>  <p>If I "solve it" as Xcode says, the final app behaves random. </p>  <p>Is it possible to build this project on Xcode 5.1.1 as if it were 4.6.3? (in other words: changing the project settings, but keeping the code intact)</p>  <p>AFAIS, the C++ flags have the same value for both Xcode versions.<br> C Language Dialect = GNU99 [-std=gnu99]<br> C++ Language Dialect = GNU++11 [-std=gnu++11]<br> C++ standard library = libc++ (LLVM C++ standard library with C++11 support)</p>
