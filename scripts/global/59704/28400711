<p>I've read close to 50 threads on here, regarding linking frameworks to an Xcode project, but I've yet to find one that covers an issue I'm having with Facebook's Audience Network framework.</p>  <p>I'm using Xcode 4.2.3 (I'm on an old mac with OS X Lion - don't ask!), building for iOS 6.1, using Facebook SDK 3.2.1.</p>  <p>I'm trying to test banner ad formats within specific view controllers, however, getting an error every time I build the code, based exactly on the tutorials, even Facebook's sample code isn't compiling. I've added <code>FBAudienceNetwork.framework</code> to almost every folder on my machine, added via dragging and dropping, and via the Link Binary with Libraries option. I've tried to changing the Framework Search paths, to no avail.</p>  <p>I'm using the following frameworks: AdSupport, StoreKit, CoreMotion, UIKit, Foundation, CoreGraphics</p>  <p>Getting the following error:</p>  <pre><code>Undefined symbols for architecture i386:   "_OBJC_CLASS_$_CAShapeLayer", referenced from:       objc-class-ref in FBAudienceNetwork(FBAdChoicesView.o)   "_OBJC_CLASS_$_CATransaction", referenced from:       objc-class-ref in FBAudienceNetwork(FBAdUtility.o)       objc-class-ref in FBAudienceNetwork(FBAdMediumRectangleView.o)   "_OBJC_CLASS_$_NSURLSession", referenced from:       objc-class-ref in FBAudienceNetwork(FBAdUtility.o)   "_kCATransactionDisableActions", referenced from:       -[FBAdMediumRectangleView updateViewForSize:view:] in FBAudienceNetwork(FBAdMediumRectangleView.o) ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture i386 clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation) </code></pre>  <p>Any suggestions?</p>  <p>UPDATE: Added in Quartzcore.framework, and errors now reduced to;</p>  <p>Undefined symbols for architecture i386:   "_OBJC_CLASS_$_NSURLSession", referenced from:       objc-class-ref in FBAudienceNetwork(FBAdUtility.o) ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture i386 clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)</p>  <p>I've made Foundation.framework optional. Build settings armv7, armv7s, iOS 6.1, Simulator only. Build Active Architecture ONLY Yes/No.</p>
