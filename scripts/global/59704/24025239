<p>I found a problem with my build, looks like Xcode5 changed this in comparing to Xcode4.</p>  <p>before, in Xcode4: I choose to build "universal" app and my app with iPhone size is scaled on iPad, can be found both in iPhone and iPad store.</p>  <p>now, in Xcode5: if I choose "universal", my app with iPhone size is no longer scaled on iPad, but keeps the original size while leaving the whole right part empty. If I choose "iPhone", it is scaled on iPad, but can no longer be found in iPad store.</p>  <p>I noticed UIDeviceFamily is removed from Info.plist in Xcode5</p>  <p>what I want is simply the same build result with Xcode5 for my app as with Xcode4. Anyone has any idea about it?</p>  <p>Here's my code to initiate the root view in </p>  <pre><code>- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions  DialoguesVC* dvc = [[DialoguesVC alloc] init]; HomeVC* hvc = [[HomeVC alloc] initWithRootViewController:dvc]; [self.window setRootViewController:hvc]; </code></pre>  <p>HomeVC is a UINavigationViewController.</p>
