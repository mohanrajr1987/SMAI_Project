When I run the sample cart app I have in my framework folder on the github repository in XCode 4, I get about 80 different compiler errors relating to linker errors against AVFoundation and MessageUI.</p>  <p>What I'm totally confused about is why the sample app runs fine on XCode 5, yet XCode 4 it doesn't even come close. </p>  <p>The static framework was compiled with XCode 5, would that make a difference?</p>
