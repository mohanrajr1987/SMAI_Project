<p>So I started to create my game app and I have run into a problem. I am new to coding and so I am having trouble with the intro to my app. When the app loads it fades in the title and imageview at the top of the screen, so essentially when the screen loads up an imageview and a textbox fade in at the same time 2 seconds after the screen loads. The problem I have is that I also have a "Play Now!" button that fades in after 3 seconds. I need this "Play Now!" button, when clicked, to make that imageview and textbox to fade back out so I can begin the actual game part. And of course the "Play Now!" button will need to fade when clicked as well. How do I connect the button with the two faded in objects?</p>
