<p>I have this file macdeveloperprofile.developerprofile from my Macbook before its hard drive died. My projects were compiled with XCode 4.3.2 so I am trying to recreate that environment by installing XCode 4.3.2, but I don't remember if the file of the developer profile that I have was exported from that version or XCode of some newer version. Can this still be imported in 4.3.2?</p>
