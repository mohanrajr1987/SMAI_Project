<p>I've never used Objective X, or Xcode, or developed any software for OS X, but I'm trying to convert an HTML5 website into a standalone app to run on OS x, so I can get it running full-screen, i.e. without the browser location bars and other chrome that I don't seem to be able to remove from Safari or Google Chrome.</p>  <p>After reading <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/8491261/981959">this answer</a> about creating a native HTML5 app for OS X I tried following the steps in the <a href="http://www.lostdecadegames.com/how-to-embed-html5-into-a-native-mac-osx-app/" rel="nofollow">linked tutorial</a> on a machine running Mavericks (10.9.5) and Xcode 6.1.1, but none of the steps seem to make sense for Xcode 6.</p>  <p>For example, step 4:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>In your Xcode window, under Overview / Groups &amp; Files, expand WebViewExample / Frameworks by clicking the arrow icon.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I don't see an "Overview", but in the project navigator I added the WebKit.framework as a linked framework.</p>  <p>I don't see "Resources" either, which step 6 talks about:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>On the same level as Frameworks, expand Resources by clicking the arrow icon.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Where do I put the resources (i.e. the html files and images to open in the webview)?</p>  <p>I tried copying the code from steps 10 and 11 into the relevant <code>.h</code> and <code>.m</code> files, but then for step 12 I don't know how to find an Interface Builder. </p>  <p>Is it even possible to follow these steps on Xcode 6?</p>  <p>I tried building the project with what I'd managed so far, and get the error described at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/8368157/981959">Existing ivar &#39;title&#39; for unsafe_unretained property &#39;title&#39; must be __unsafe_unretained</a> for the <code>window</code> variable.</p>  <p>I "fixed" the error by just letting the compiler generate the ivar (or I think that's what I did! I have never used ObjC, but I removed the body of the interface in the <code>.h</code> header).</p>  <p>That ran, but opened a blank window, presumably because I hadn't created any resources folder so there was no HTML file at this location:</p>  <pre><code>NSString *htmlPath = [resourcesPath stringByAppendingString:@"/htdocs/index.html"]; </code></pre>  <p>I'd love to put the files there, but I don't know where the <code>resourcesPath</code> is meant to be for this project!</p>  <p>(I tried adding my HTML files to the project, at the top level since I don't have a Resources folder, but that didn't change anything.)</p>  <p>After giving up trying to create the app from scratch I downloaded the project from <a href="https://github.com/lostdecade/web_view_example" rel="nofollow">GitHub</a> and tried to open the .xcodeproj file, but in the project navigator the project says "1 target, missing base SDK". I set the base SDK, and it works ... but I can't copy pieces from that project into my own because the project structure is completely different.</p>  <p>So mostly I'd like to know if trying to use that tutorial is hopeless on Xcode 6, but if not where do I put my "Resources" files?</p>  <p>SHould I just give up and use <a href="http://www.tidesdk.org/" rel="nofollow">TideSDK</a>, which looks quite promising?</p>
