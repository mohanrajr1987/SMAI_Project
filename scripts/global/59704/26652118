<p>I have made some changes in a Mac application which was already build in XCode 4.6. This application works perfectly when run through XCode. And also works perfectly when I run it in my system after making it .app extension (by going through organizer > distribute > extract as application.) But the problem is when I run this .app in client side, it will work fine for some time and then it gets stuck saying could not load the HomeViewController which is a xib file. It works fine for the first 2-3 times and then the same pages doesn't get loaded. Also the Database returns no value after that. Is it because of some memory issue of the client machine?</p>  <p>I am sorry, I have no idea what extra details do you want, to understand the above question.</p>
