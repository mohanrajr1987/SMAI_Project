<p>I am working on a new project and I need to define the build settings for the debug and release targets. For that purpose, I want to create configuration files so that Xcode can pick relevant settings from the file itself and populate the <code>Build Settings</code>. This helps in easier maintenance of the code.</p>  <p>Currently, no settings are being picked from the config files. How can I make sure that Xcode performs the desired function?</p>
