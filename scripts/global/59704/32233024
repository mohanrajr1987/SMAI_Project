<p>We are using boost. On my dev machine, I downloaded it and installed it using  <code>brew install boost</code>.  </p>  <p>We use the static version of several boost libraries, for example:<br> libboost_system.a,<br> libboost_system-mt.a,<br> libboost_thread.a,<br> libboost_thread-mt.a</p>  <p>On Xcode:<br> We link against each one of those libraries,<br> we added <code>/usr/local/include</code> to "Header Search paths"<br> we added <code>/usr/local/lib</code> to "Library Search paths"<br> And we added a Copy Phase on Build Phases: we copy all the linked libraries and set the destination to: Frameworks.</p>  <p>It works for all Devs. But the app doesn't work on the testers machine. When he tries to open the .app, he gets this error:  </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Dyld Error Message:   Library not loaded:<br>   /usr/local/lib/libboost_thread-mt.dylib   Referenced from:<br>   /Volumes/VOLUME/MyApp.app/Contents/MacOS/MyApp   Reason: image not   found</p> </blockquote>  <p><strong>What are we doing wrong?<br> Why is it complaining about a .dylib, we are not using it.?</strong></p>  <p>FYI. We are using Xcode 4.6.3</p>
