<p>I have five UIButtons displayed in UIActionsheet. This is displayed fine in portrait-mode. However, in case of landscape-mode all UIButtons are grouped together and presented by iOS (6.1.3) as shown in screenshot. </p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5fa0p.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>Also, the console displays following message :</p>  <p><strong>Presenting action sheet clipped by its superview. Some controls might not respond to touches. On iPhone try -[UIActionSheet showFromTabBar:] or -[UIActionSheet showFromToolbar:] instead of -[UIActionSheet showInView:].</strong></p>  <p>I would like to know the reason and possible solution to avoid it.</p>
