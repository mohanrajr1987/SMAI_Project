<p>I am new to iOS app development. </p>  <p>I am trying to create a new project using Cordova2.9 from the <code>/cordova/ios/bin</code> create command. I opened that project using XCode4.2. I tried building the project but the CordovaLib is failing with compilation problems in Cordova classes as showing below.</p>  <blockquote>   <ol>   <li>CDVCamera.h</li>   </ol>      <p>Error : REceiver Type CDVCamera for instance message does not declare a method with selector displayPopover and similary fo another method imagePiockerControllerReturnImageResult</p> </blockquote>  <p>Could anyone tell me how to resolve this?</p>
