<p>I have two projects. The first is a 3rd party static library, which contains a huge amount of source code (400+) and takes a <em>long</em> time to build but I never change anything in there. The second is the app that depends on the first project, which is very fast to build.</p>  <p>The problem I'm facing is, sometimes, maybe after header file changes, the incremental build doesn't pick up the change and thus I need to do a clean/build to make sure it builds correctly. But when I clean, it also cleans the 3rd party static library, which means a long waiting time. I would love to be able to only clean the second project so that I can have a clean build every time (and very quickly).</p>  <p>Right now the 3rd party static library project is included in the app project in the Project Navigator. In "Build Phases" I see the 3rd party library appear both in "Target Dependencies" and "Link Binary With Libraries". In "Edit Schema -> Build", I also see the library appear as a sub-item under my app project.</p>
