<p>I need to have an custom keyboard while Bluetooth scanner is connected, so I followed this  link <a href="https://github.com/kulpreetchilana/Custom-iOS-Keyboards" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/kulpreetchilana/Custom-iOS-Keyboards</a> and achieved the same. So No issues in ios7. </p>  <p>But when i try to test in ios8 the custom keyboard act like the normal one. If scanner is ON the custom keyboard no more shown up. Its very urgent for me. Can you please help me?</p>  <pre><code>PKCustomKeyboard *customKeyboard = [[PKCustomKeyboard alloc] init]; [customKeyboard setTextView:cell.textFieldQty]; </code></pre>  <p>The above code was fine in ios7 not wokring in ios8. Please help!.</p>
