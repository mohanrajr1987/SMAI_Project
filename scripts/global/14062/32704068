<p>I have a collection of domain objects that are transformed into a JAXB class generated from an XSD. The XML and JAXB class has the following structure:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;message&gt;   &lt;part&gt;...&lt;/part&gt;   &lt;part&gt;...&lt;/part&gt;   &lt;part&gt;...&lt;/part&gt; &lt;/message&gt; </code></pre>  <p>How would you do this in Camel to avoid an OutOfMemoryError? The transformation completes without problems, but when I try to marshal into XML I quickly run into memory issues.</p>  <p>I've been looking into JAXB fragments and partial marshalling, but without any luck. Any advice is highly appreciated!</p>
