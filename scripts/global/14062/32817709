<p>I’m very new to Apache Camel and will very appreciate if someone could provide me what camel components may be used to solve particular task. I have a simple REST WS. This service is not accessible to audience.  The idea is to build middle layer between user requests and endpoint service. So I will have to catch user’s request, make some manipulations with it, send to restricted WS and give a response to user. I’m just started learning apache camel and the question is what is the best way to implement this logic. Thx in advance!</p>
