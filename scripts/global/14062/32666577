<p>I am using blueprint to develop a camel restlet project to deploy on Fuse. It is a very simple HTTP POST with simple text body. I set the exchange pattern to <code>Inonly</code>.</p>  <p>However, I was expecting the connection to be terminated after the actual post, but I am receiving a 200 OK with the body filled with whatever the final body is in the processing at end.</p>  <p>Is this how it is meant to work? Do I therefore need to manually clear the body?</p>  <p>Also, what happens if the processing is a long running process? I would want to terminate straight after the data have been posted, rather than wait until the  complete processing inside the context.</p>  <p>My blueprint looks like this:</p>  <pre><code> &lt;camelContext xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/blueprint"&gt;   &lt;route id="timerToLog"&gt;     &lt;from uri="restlet:http://localhost:7070/arena?restletMethod=POST&amp;amp;exchangePattern=inOnly"/&gt;     &lt;process ref="marcformatreader"/&gt;     &lt;log message="${body}" loggingLevel="INFO"/&gt;     &lt;process ref="marcformatwriter"/&gt;     &lt;log message="${body}" loggingLevel="INFO"/&gt;     &lt;to pattern="InOnly" uri="file:C:/Camel/output?fileName=output.mrc"/&gt;   &lt;/route&gt; &lt;/camelContext&gt; </code></pre>
