<p>I got a web service built with camel and running as an OSGi bundle on karaf.</p>  <p>When I get a request here I store the data from the request in a MySQL database. After this another bundle has to retrieve the data, do something with it and then update the dataset and mark it as processed in the db as soon as it is done. Then the first bundle got to retrieve the processed/changed data again the send it as a repsonse to the original request.</p>  <p>The problem here is that I need some kind of listener on that data in the db because the whole thing has to be as fast as possible (user is waiting for the answer).</p>  <p>Is there any possibility to solve this? Doing a query on the table every x seconds/milliseconds is really dirty...</p>
