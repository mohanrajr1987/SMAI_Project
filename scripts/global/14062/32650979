<p>I want to implement a camel aggregator on top of camel HDFS. How to set the completion predicate on the end of the file.</p>  <p>Assume HDFS directory has many files and all are picked in one scan. HDFS read data in chuks, which was known to all. Basically want to aggregate file by file read by HDFS and proceed to next route for processing. </p>  <p>some thing like</p>  <pre><code>&lt;aggregate strategyRef="aggregateStrategyRef"&gt;&lt;correlationExpression&gt;              &lt;simple&gt;header.CamelFileName&lt;/simple&gt; &lt;/correlationExpression&gt; &lt;completionPredicate&gt;***Check for the end of the file reached***         &lt;/completionPredicate&gt;            &lt;to uri="another route"/&gt; &lt;/aggregate&gt; </code></pre>
