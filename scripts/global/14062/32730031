<p>I want to combine Akka, Apache Camel, Spring and do not know the way forward for leveraging the three things in the same project.</p>  <p>I was successfully able to</p>  <pre><code>1. write some working code with akka, akka-camel extension and camel routes(Java DSL) 2. use camel and spring (use java DSL but spring for transactions and etc..) </code></pre>  <p>Now I need to combine 1 and 2. Can anyone suggest me the simplest way to achieve this?</p>
