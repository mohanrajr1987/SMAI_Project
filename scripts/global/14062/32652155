<p>We have a requirement to audit a Servlet route.</p>  <p>We have looked at using a Wire Tap which would Post a new HTTP request to a separate audit endpoint.</p>  <p>Our reason for using a Wire Tap is so we don't block the Servlet route. </p>  <p>Our problem is that we need to log the HTTP response from the audit endpoint. Our understanding is that the Wire Tap component is InOnly and therefore will not capture the response. </p>  <p>Our current thought is to push the audit requests to a Queue after the Wiretap. We would then take the requests off the queue and call the auditing endpoint logging the responses. </p>  <p>Is this the best approach or is there a better way?</p>  <p>Could we use "setExchangePattern" to make the Wire Tap InOut? If so would it block the main route?</p>  <p>We have seen there is an OnCompletion handler but are not sure whether that would be of use to us. Again would it block the main route?</p>
