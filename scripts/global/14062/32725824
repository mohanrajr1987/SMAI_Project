<p>I have implemented 10 concurrent consumers on one of my queues. The queue will continuously process the messages and as i am using concurrent consumers there are always some in-flight messages on the queue and when i shutdown the route, camel is triggering the  default shutdown strategy timeout of 300 seconds. After researching i came to know that in-flight messages are the result of some threads which are trying to process the messages. I have the following questions on the in-flight messages:</p>  <p>1.when i shutdown the route what happens to the in-flight messages. Do we lose them or will they get processed. is there any chance they rollback to the queue.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;beanid="shutdownStrategy"class="org.apache.camel.impl.DefaultShutdownStrategy"&gt;       &lt;property name="timeout" value="30" /&gt; &lt;/bean&gt;  </code></pre>  <ol start="2"> <li>I have used the above shutdown strategy and specified the timeout to 30 seconds and the route shutdowns as expected even though there are in-flight messages. By using the code i have learned that camel will aggressively shutdowns the route and we lose all the in-flight messages.Is that true?, if yes, how can i avoid loosing the messages.</li> </ol>  <p>Any help on this is appreciated.</p>
