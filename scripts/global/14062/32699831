<p>I have a route builder that looks as follows:</p>  <pre><code>.post("/myEndpoint")     .type(MyObject.class)     .to("bean:myListener?method=create") </code></pre>  <p>I would like this to return a 201 Created HTTP Response Code, at present its returns a 200 OK.</p>  <p>Is there a way to do this in the RouteBuilder without having to forward any results onto a separate service class and then manually set the code on the Exchange?</p>
