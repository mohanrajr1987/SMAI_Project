<p>Ideally I would like to have a route like this:</p>  <pre><code>from("jetty:http://0.0.0.0:8080/{pathParam1}/{pathParam2) </code></pre>  <p>So that a consumer would then be able to access the value using:</p>  <pre><code>exchange.getIn().getHeader("pathParam1") </code></pre>  <p>The camel <a href="http://camel.apache.org/rest.html" rel="nofollow">rest component</a> supports this but I would then need to repeat the route for each request method (GET, PUT, etc.) and I am not sure if using the rest component adds overhead that I don't need.</p>  <p>I see that camel does automatically parse out query parameters into exchange headers, but I can only find the full path and want to avoid my own parsing.</p>
