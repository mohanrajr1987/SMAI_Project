<p>I'm using XML based Java Spring DSL for Camel routes and need to do a very simple replace in a string. Normally it works ok with an OGNL expression. But if i use special characters like \r or \n - it fails to be executed as java expression. Example which doesn't work:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;setBody&gt;     &lt;simple&gt;${body.replace("\n","\r\n")}&lt;/simple&gt; &lt;/setBody&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Any ideas how to pass these chars to the java in a correct way ?</p>  <p>Camel version is 2.12, just in case.</p>
