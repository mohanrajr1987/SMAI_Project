<p>I am using camel's jdbc component which delivers a Map per table row. I am using a <code>select *</code> statement to get all fields of a table that changes sometimes. I am applying different validators and each one need some fields to be present to do its work.</p>  <p>My problem is how to distinguish between a field that is not present and a null value (null value might be ok but a missing field may be not ok - could not be validated).</p>
