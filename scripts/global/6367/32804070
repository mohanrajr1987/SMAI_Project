<p>I have some elements that are positioned using percents; let's call these elements set 1. I have another set of elements which I want to overlay them - lets call these elements set2. I want set2 elements to positionally be on top of set1 elements, but they have a different parent container and therefore the percents being calculated are different. Is there some sort of sass mixin that will make it so the positions generated from the elements from set 2 inherent the positioning values from set 1?</p>
