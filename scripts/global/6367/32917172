<p>I would like to have my row widths act like this:</p>  <pre><code>// $small-breakpoint:  em-calc(640); // $medium-breakpoint: em-calc(1024); // $large-breakpoint:  em-calc(1440); // $xlarge-breakpoint: em-calc(1920);  // $small-range:   (0, $small-breakpoint); // $medium-range:  ($small-breakpoint  + em-calc(1), $medium-breakpoint); </code></pre>  <p>For small and medium I would like to have my rows be 100% the screen width.</p>  <pre><code>// $large-range:   ($medium-breakpoint + em-calc(1), $large-breakpoint); </code></pre>  <p>For large I would like my rows to be 1024px wide (or <code>em-calc(1024)</code> really)</p>  <pre><code>// $xlarge-range:  ($large-breakpoint  + em-calc(1), $xlarge-breakpoint); </code></pre>  <p>For x-large I would like my rows to be 1440px wide</p>  <pre><code>// $xxlarge-range: ($xlarge-breakpoint + em-calc(1), em-calc(99999999)); </code></pre>  <p>For xx-large I would like my rows to be 1920px wide</p>  <p>What I don't like, which is what I have currently, is a max size for the row width and anything less than that is 100% of the screen.#</p>  <p>What is the proper way to achieve this?</p>  <p><strong>Update</strong></p>  <p>I may be thinking about this in the wrong manner. Maybe I should have the row max-width set to 100% for all media queries, but have my own custom <em>container</em> sizing that I use for things to occupy and I'll just tie this in with the Foundation media width breakpoints.</p>  <p>I think that this may be the most suitable solution.</p>
