<p>I'm trying to run gulp-ruby-sass on Windows.</p>  <p>I've already installed Ruby and Sass like that: <code>$ gem install sass</code></p>  <p>My gulp.task looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>gulp.task('styles', function() {    return sass('src/scss/**/*.scss')      .on('error', sass.logError)      .pipe(gulp.dest('css')); }); </code></pre>  <p>When I cd into the root directory of my project and run <code>$ gulp styles</code>, I get this:</p>  <pre><code>[22:54:52] Using gulpfile c:\wamp\www\wordpress\ wp-content\themes\bootscores\gulpfile.js [22:54:52] Starting 'styles'... [22:54:52] 'sass' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file. Error in plugin 'gulp-ruby-sass' Message:     Gem undefined is not installed. [22:54:52] Finished 'styles' after 89 ms </code></pre>  <p>I've been searching for a solution to this problem for about two hours now and still haven't found one that would help me.</p>
