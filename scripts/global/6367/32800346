<p>This is my first foray into this type of web dev.</p>  <p>I've tried installing a site via yeoman to have the grunt serve active while I learn SASS. Every time I try doing this I seem to get different errors that I don't understand. </p>  <p>Setup:</p>  <ul> <li>Mac OSX 10.6.8</li> <li>Sass 3.4.18 (Selective Steve)</li> <li>XAMPP 5.6.3-0</li> <li>ruby 2.2.1p85 (2015-02-26 revision 49769) [x86_64-darwin10.0]</li> <li>Compass 1.0.3 (Polaris)</li> <li>npm 2.14.3</li> <li>node v4.1.0</li> <li>bower 1.5.3</li> <li>git version 2.5.3   &lt;-- EDIT: forgot about that, took ages to install too!</li> </ul>  <p>I've made a /test folder on the desktop and then follow this guide <a href="https://github.com/yeoman/generator-webapp" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/yeoman/generator-webapp</a>. I had followed other guides prior to this, the most useful was this video, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKiaLSJW5xI" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKiaLSJW5xI</a></p>  <p>I get the usual options I'm told to expect, but it say 'SASS' not 'SASS and Compass', why is this? I have both installed.</p>  <p>If I install all 3, the grunt command hangs on all different parts (grunt serve won't work as a result). The grunt serve error is:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Warning: OptionParser::InvalidOption: invalid option: --source-map         Use --trace for backtrace. Use --force to continue.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I'm going to try building with each different combination of yo webapp builds and edit this comment with some of the errors.</p>  <p>EDIT 1: Reinstalling now, bootstrap and sass (no modernizer). I'm getting loads of node-sass errors. No idea why.</p>  <p>EDIT 2: I followed this guide again before another install, (I can't post the link as my rep is less than 10, its from yeoman.io /setup) I still get yo webapp install errors like this:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>optipng pre-build test failed<br>   ℹ compiling from source<br>   ✔ optipng built successfully </p>      <p>npm WARN optional dep failed, continuing bufferutil@1.2.1</p> </blockquote>  <p>There are also LOADS of errors under something called 'CCX(target)'</p>  <blockquote>   <p>gyp ERR! build error</p>      <p>gyp ERR! stack Error: <code>make</code> failed with exit code: 2</p>      <p>gyp ERR! stack     at ChildProcess.onExit (/usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/node-gyp/lib/build.js:270:23)</p> </blockquote>  <p>etc. it goes on for a while. Also:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>npm ERR! node-sass@3.3.3 postinstall: <code>node scripts/build.js</code></p>      <p>npm ERR! This is most likely a problem with the node-sass package,</p>      <p>npm ERR! not with npm itself.</p>      <p>npm ERR! Tell the author that this fails on your system:</p>      <p>npm ERR!     node scripts/build.js</p>      <p>npm ERR! You can get their info via:</p>      <p>npm ERR!     npm owner ls node-sass</p>      <p>npm ERR! There is likely additional logging output above.</p> </blockquote>  <p>EDIT 3: I tried just install bootstrap (without SASS or Modernizer) and noticed this error-</p>  <blockquote>   <p>CXX(target) Release/obj.target/validation/src/validation.o</p>      <p>cc1plus: error: unrecognized command line option "-std=gnu++0x"</p>      <p>make: *** [Release/obj.target/validation/src/validation.o] Error 1</p> </blockquote>  <p>...after searching it seems to be an error associated with GCC. I have GCC 4.2.1 (which I'm assured is ancient history) but I'm currently downloading the 'kennethreitz' installer for Snow Leopard off github.</p>  <p>EDIT 4: I just tapped in 'brew install gcc', hope it updates... time to play the waiting game.</p>  <p>In the meantime, any other tips on getting a similar setup on 10.6.8 (ie. auto-reload, sass, bootstrap)?</p>  <p>EDIT 5: Wow, that took a <em>really</em> long time, still on GCC 4.2.1 and everything is the same, ie. doesn't work. Should I give up? What are my alternatives for a web dev workflow?</p>
