Found some similar questions on stackoverwflow and other resources, but most of them was regarding syntax mistakes. </p>  <p>Can somebody tell me what is wrong with this code and why SASS is not generating :hover in resulting css?</p>  <p>Here is my SASS code:</p>  <pre><code>.img-ornament     -webkit-transition: all 0.5s ease     -moz-transition: all 0.5s ease     -ms-transition: all 0.5s ease     -o-transition: all 0.5s ease     transition: all 0.5s ease     &amp;:hover         -webkit-transform:scale(0.75)         -moz-transform:scale(0.75)         -ms-transform:scale(0.75)         -o-transform:scale(0.75)         transform:scale(0.75) </code></pre>  <p>Here is resulting css: </p>  <pre><code>.img-ornament {     -webkit-transition: all 0.5s ease;     -moz-transition: all 0.5s ease;     -ms-transition: all 0.5s ease;     -o-transition: all 0.5s ease;     transition: all 0.5s ease; } </code></pre>  <p>Where is :hover portion?</p>  <p>here is sassmeister's gist <a href="https://gist.github.com/sayfulloev/396477b5a91f9511c8eb" rel="nofollow">https://gist.github.com/sayfulloev/396477b5a91f9511c8eb</a></p>
