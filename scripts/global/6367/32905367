<p>I am using VisualStudio 2013 with WebEssentials 2013.5.  Using SASS with Susy framework. When I try to compile any .scss file, this is what I get:</p>  <pre><code>PM: SCSS: Compiling file.scss PM: Looking for resource @ http://localhost.:27610/ PM: Message: may only compare numbers </code></pre>  <p>And also:</p>  <pre><code>Compilation Error occurred (see error list to navigate to the error location): Error found at line 104, column 23: Code: undefined Message: may only compare numbers </code></pre>  <p>I was searching for this particular line in all my .scss files but wasn't able to see the problem. </p>  <p>When I open this files on another computer, everyhing is ok. I tried to reinstall WebEssentials (thought it was making troubles) but it didn't help me at all. Anyone familiar with this?</p>
