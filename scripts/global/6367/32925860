<p>I currently have a following piece of code in SCSS:</p>  <pre><code>.someClass {   background: #fff url(../images/bg1.png) repeat-x; } .otherClass {   background: #5ae url(../images/bg2.jpg) repeat-y; } </code></pre>  <p>I'd like to create a function, say <code>image</code>, that I could use to simplify this to:</p>  <pre><code>.someClass {   background: #fff image(bg1.png) repeat-x; } .otherClass {   background: #5ae image(bg2.jpg) repeat-y; } </code></pre>  <p>but I have no idea how to write that function, as simple </p>  <pre><code>@function image($path) {@return url(../images/#{$path})} </code></pre>  <p>does not work (edit: fails with message <code>Syntax error: Invalid CSS after "...fff image(bg1": expected ")", was ".png) repeat-x ..."</code> on usage), and also </p>  <pre><code>@function image($path) { @url: '../images/' + $path; @return url(#{$url});} </code></pre>  <p>won't work as well (edit: fails with <code>Syntax error: Invalid CSS after "...($path) { @url:": expected pseudoclass or pseudoelement, was " '../images/' +..."</code> on declaration).</p>  <p>I have read <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3848147/image-paths-in-css-to-support-cdn">Image paths in CSS to support CDN</a>, but this only allows me to replace the common part of path (which is a good start), but I'd like to replace the whole part. I cannot use a mixin, as I'd like to use it with different other parts of the <code>background</code> property, and sometimes only with <code>background-image</code>.</p>  <p>Note, I'm using plain SCSS, not compass, Ruby-on-Rails, node.js or something.</p>
