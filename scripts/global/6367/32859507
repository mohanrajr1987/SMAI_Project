<p>Here is my current (the relevant portion) gulpfile:</p>  <pre><code>gulp.task('styles', function() {   return gulp.src('app/stylesheets/main.scss')     .pipe(plumber())     .pipe(sass())     .pipe(autoprefixer())     .pipe(gulpif(production, cssmin()))     .pipe(gulp.dest('public/css'))     .pipe(livereload()); }); </code></pre>  <p>With following main.scss:</p>  <pre><code>@import "normalize"; @import "foundation"; </code></pre>  <p>here's the folder structure of the app/stylesheets folder:</p>  <pre><code>-- app -- stylesheets ---foundation.scss                        |-normalize.scss                        |-main.scss                        |-foundation-------_functions.scss                                         |-_settings.scss                                         |-_components/ </code></pre>  <p>The resulting main.css file after gulp processing ends up containing only the normalize.scss styles and what looks like the _tables.scss and _visibility.scss components.</p>  <p>I have tried using includePaths with gulp-sass and that didn't compile anything at all.</p>  <p>Also, importing the css rather than scss in the main.scss file works just fine, but I want to change the row-width setting to 100%, so I'd like to use the scss files.</p>  <p>All foundation files were left as is. Please help me understand why not all the components are importing! Thank you!</p>
