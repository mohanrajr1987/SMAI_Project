<p>I can't figure how to disable some debug information generated at css compilation. It outputs something like this hundreds of times, making the file size HUGE:</p>  <pre><code>@media -sass-debug-info{filename{font-family:file\:\/\/C\:\/sandbox\/project\/bower_components\/bootstrap-sass\/assets\/stylesheets\/bootstrap\/_normalize\.scss}line{font-family:\0000333}} </code></pre>  <p>I just learned that this is related to a firebug plugin called firesass and I've got no intention to use it.</p>  <p>This is my <code>config.rb</code> file:</p>  <pre><code>http_path = '/' css_dir = 'assets/styles/css' sass_dir = 'assets/styles/sass' scss_dir = 'assets/styles/sass' javascript_dir = 'modules' fonts_dir = 'assets/fonts' images_dir = 'assets/images' add_import_path = '../bower_components' debug_info = false  firesass = false </code></pre>  <p>I am using Koala App to parse the <code>.scss</code> files. </p>  <p>Any help would be awesome.</p>
