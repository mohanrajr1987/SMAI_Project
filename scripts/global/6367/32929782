<p>I'm using sass and want a padding of 10px around an element with the class of top.  However, my element is not responding to my padding.  It is currently displaying roughly 10-15px of extra padding on the top and bottom and none on the right or left.   Is there a way I could be somehow overriding the code earlier?  Would the font affect the padding?  Here is the current code:</p>  <pre><code>.top {   width: 805px;   margin: 20px 100px 0px 253px;   background-color: black;   color: white;   font-family: "Open Sans";   font-size: 27px;   padding: 10px;   border-radius: 15px; } </code></pre>  <p>Thanks!</p>
