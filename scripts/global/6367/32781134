<p>I am currently creating a simple project using Bourbon's Neat grid system, and currently I am trying to create a 3 column list of 6 objects in total, but when I try to span them at 4 columns each, something happens and they become only 2 columns.</p>  <p>It adds margin only on the right side of each element, but that is okay since everything is pre-set I guess? So that is not the problem. </p>  <p>What can I do to make this work?</p>  <p>Here is the SASS excerpt:</p>  <pre><code>    #serviceList {        @include row();         li {            @include pad(1em);            @include span-columns(4 of 12);             img, p {                float: left;            }        }     } </code></pre>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
