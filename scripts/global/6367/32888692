<p>Coming from a more traditional drupal background, I have been recently trying to teach myself meteor to broaden my horizon.</p>  <p>Currently in the process of building up an app prototype, I am also trying to use bourbon, neat and bitters altogether to make it look more "decent". </p>  <p>I am using the following packages (<a href="https://github.com/wolvesio/meteor-bourbon" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/wolvesio/meteor-bourbon</a> and related for neat and bitters), but as of today, meteor irremediably return an error when trying to import the needed files.</p>  <p>Has anyone managed to make this work or is it preferable to switch to less or stylus?</p>  <p>Cheers</p>
