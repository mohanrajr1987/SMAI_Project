<p>I want to be able to update my client as soon as method one is done. I need to inform the user that events where found and that they are being worked on. Can I do this asynchronously and how. Any documentation or examples are appreciated. </p>  <p>This is my current AJAX call:</p>    <pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>function getEvents() {   $.ajax({     type: "GET",     url: "EventTrackingSystem/GetEvents",     success: function(response) {       console.log(Success);     },     error: function(error) {       console.log(error);       alert(error.responseText);     }   }); } </code></pre>    <p>This is my controller C# code.  The first method will get all the events from the api. Then create a local worksheet record.  </p>  <pre><code>[HttpGet] public int GetEvents() {    EventProvider Event = new EventProvider (); //I want to return the number of events found and show that on the client while the next method is executing.    Event.CreateWorksheet();            } </code></pre>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
