<p>We have a multisite solution with individual visual studio solutions for each websites. Then we have master solution to build/deploy all websites.</p>  <p>Firstly, not sure whether it's a best practice to include web.config in Visual Studio solution. But I think all the nuget packages needs web.config to add their settings.</p>  <p>As a result, we have web.config for each solution. However when we deploy from master web.config gets overwritten by each sites.</p>  <p>Could someone please suggest how this issue can be fixed?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
