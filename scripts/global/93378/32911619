<p>I am looking for a good way to loop through images in a folder of my website based on the URL in MVC5 razor.</p>  <p>The urls will be structured like this:<br> /Home/Media/Photos/Gallery/GALLERYNAME</p>  <p>I added the following to my RouteConfig:</p>  <pre><code>    routes.MapRoute(         name: "Gallery",         url: "{controller}/Media/Photos/{action}/{galleryName}",         defaults: new { controller = "Home", action = "Index", galleryName = UrlParameter.Optional }     ); </code></pre>  <p>I have the following in my HomeController:</p>  <pre><code>public ActionResult Gallery(string galleryName) {     ViewBag.Message = galleryName;     return View(); } </code></pre>  <p>Now based on this ViewBag value 'galleryName' that is sent to my Gallery view I would like to loop through the following directory so I can get each image and display it for lightbox viewing:</p>  <p>"~/Content/img/Media/Photos/GALLERYNAME"</p>  <p>I am not sure if I should do this looping directly in my view or in the Gallery ActionResult in my controller and then past a list of string containing all of the paths to the images. When I try it in the controller I keep having problems when using Directory.EnumerateFiles. It is searching with a path on my C drive. I need the path to be relative to my site. Something tells me I might need to create a virtual directory to use System.IO for this.</p>  <p><strong>HERE IS MY FINAL CODE IF ANYONE WANTS TO SEE OR COMMENT ON:</strong></p>  <pre><code>public ActionResult Gallery(string galleryName) {     string galleryPath = Path.Combine(this.Server.MapPath(@"~/Content/img/Media/Photos"), galleryName);     var fullImagePaths = Directory.GetFiles(galleryPath);      string sitePath = "~/Content/img/Media/Photos/";     var imagePaths = fullImagePaths.Select(fp =&gt; sitePath + Path.GetFileName(fp));      return View(imagePaths); } </code></pre>  <p>This produces a list of strings that can go right into an img src attribute: i.e. <code>"~/Content/img/Media/Photos/myimage.jpg"</code></p>
