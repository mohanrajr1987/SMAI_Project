<p>I have an asp.net mvc application that authenticates calls into another service.  In the event of a timeout or hitting a rate limit I want to retry the call.  I found endjin's <a href="https://github.com/endjin/Endjin.Retry" rel="nofollow">retry framework</a>.  I implemented it in my code like this:</p>  <pre><code>Retriable.Retry(() =&gt; Login()); </code></pre>  <p>And that works, it retries the event if an error is thrown.  I want to write to a log anytime a retry occurs with what the method being retried is and how many times we've tried.  It seems like there should be an event that fires when retry happens but I haven't been able to get a working event handler for it.</p>  <p>Am I going about this right?</p>
