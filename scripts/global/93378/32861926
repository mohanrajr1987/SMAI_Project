<p>So I have multiple intranet website projects in one solution. All .net 4.6 MVC 5. One of those projects is a "Global" project housing all stylesheets and css files that apply across the Intranet. (Bootstrap, jQuery, etc) As well as several universal apps that deal with the "other stuff" (Email queueing, Security, etc) </p>  <p>I have been investigating the bundling feature again. I ditched it originally because it was across projects and it didn't like it. However I've started looking again, and I love the minification only on release mode and separate files in debug mode - great. However across project I have to reference the bundles with a url which always minify and are cached to the point where the project needs rebuilding to update the css. This is playing havoc with my attempts to update styles and expect it to work with BrowserLink.</p>  <p>I'd rather not go back to an ugly list of links that change with debug mode or not, is there a way of bundling files from another project in the same solution, or from another URL in release mode?</p>
