<p>I am working on an asp.net mvc 5 web application , deployed inside IIS-8, and i have a method inside my application to perform a long running task which mainly scans our network for servers &amp; VMs and update our database with the scan results. method execution might last between 30-40 minutes to complete on production environment. and i am using a schedule tool named Hangfire which will call this method 2 times a day.</p>  <p>here is the job definition inside the startup.cs file, which will call the method at <code>8:01 am</code> &amp; <code>8:01 pm</code>:-</p>  <pre><code>public void Configuration(IAppBuilder app) {     var options = new SqlServerStorageOptions     {         PrepareSchemaIfNecessary = false     };     GlobalConfiguration.Configuration.UseSqlServerStorage("scanservice",options);      RecurringJob.AddOrUpdate(() =&gt; ss.Scan(), "01 8,20 ***"); } </code></pre>  <p>and here is the method which is being called twice a day by the schedule tool:-</p>  <pre><code>public void Scan() {     Service ss = new Service();     ss.NetworkScan().Wait(); } </code></pre>  <p>Finally the method which do the real scan is (i only provide a high level description of what the method will do):-</p>  <pre><code>public async Task&lt;ScanResult&gt; NetworkScan() {     // retrieve the server info from the DB     // loop over all servers &amp; then execute some power shell commands to scan the network &amp; retrieve the info for each server one by one...     // after the shell command completed for each server, i will update the related server info inside the DB  </code></pre>  <p>currently i did some tests on our test environment and every thing worked well ,, where the scan took around 25 seconds to scan 2 test servers.but now we are planning to move the application to production and we have around 120++ servers to scan. so i estimate the method execution to take around 30 -40 minutes to complete on the production environment. so my question is how i can make sure that this execution will never expire , and the ScanNetwork() method will complete till the end?</p>
