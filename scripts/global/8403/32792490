<p>I have a very basic script to move the camera from the mouse position, but I want to constrain the rotation of the z axis to some values. With the code below it all works fine, but the camera can be rotated fully on the z axis, I want to limit it to 20 and -40. I have tried to use mathf.clamp but that didn't work and when printed to the console it only printed out the right most value in the mathf.clamp. I also tried using an if statement to see if the rotation was over the limit, and then to reset it if it was. But neither worked... I have also looked around on Unity answers but I don't understand any of the other answers, could someone show me how to do it?</p>  <p>Code:</p>  <pre><code>void Update () {         transform.rotation = Quaternion.Euler(0f, Input.mousePosition.x, Input.mousePosition.y);     } </code></pre>
