<p>Here's my full <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/b90mbrkg/6/" rel="nofollow">Js Fiddle progress</a></p>  <pre><code>function drawPetals(num){ for(var i=0;i&lt;num;i++){     var p = Math.random()     var x = bud.x + (bud.size+50) * Math.cos(2 * Math.PI * p);     var y = bud.y + (bud.size+50) * Math.sin(2 * Math.PI * p);     petals[i] = new Petal();     petals[i].draw(x,y, Math.atan2(bud.x*x,bud.y*y) //Math.atan needs to change); } </code></pre>  <p>}</p>  <p>I tried Math.atan2() but i dont even know what it does and how it works petals[i].draw() takes 3 parameters x,y and rotation, the rotation is what i need filled in.., it needs to be pointed at the dot for however many petals i am randomly placing around it.</p>  <p>I basically want the petals facing the red dot, creating a flower. The goal of my little program would be to have a random amount of flower petals, and clicking a button would take one away, like the "he loves me, he loves me not"- thing that girls do. </p>  <p>I'm not good enough at math to figure this out, don't finish the program completely though, i do this for learning purpose, as i am (quite obviously) a beginner. :)</p>  <p>Feel free to teach me the math behind it, i like to get smarter.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance for your wisdom ;)</p>
