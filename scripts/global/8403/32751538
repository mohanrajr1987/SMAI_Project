<p>I just made an apk app using kivy. In the code, I defined the positions of all widgets according to scale of the screen. However, when I rotate the screen, say, from portrait to landscape, the absolute coordinates still stay the same, and it doesn't fit in very well.</p>  <p>Is there a method to identify whether portrait or landscape is being displayed? I need this in order to re-define the positions of my widget when user rotates the phone.</p>
