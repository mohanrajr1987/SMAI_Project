<p>I have googled this quite a bit and I can't find what I need. What is a list of 3rd party c++ header files that allow the coder to init a ray then rotate it (I define a ray as a 3d position which can be added to the position of a 3d object to move said object, then the ray can be rotated around the origin and again added to the object's position resulting in a different movement). _______________________________________example____________________________________</p>  <pre><code>#include &lt;header_file_name&gt; ray myray; float xdegrees = 0.0; float ydegrees = 0.0; float zdegrees = 0.5; myray = (1,0,0); myray = header_file_name::rotate(myray, xdegrees, ydegrees, zdegrees); </code></pre>
