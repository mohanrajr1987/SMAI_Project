<p>I have a basic car model and a wind sound. The wind has been made so it gets louder as the car speeds up, but also louder as the door opens wider. It works all fine on the left door, but screws up on the right door. I think its something to do with the rotation of the right door, at first it will be at about 90ยบ before moving, but then as the door opens, it goes past 360ยบ and then back to 0ยบ, where it continues rotating. This is what I think is messing it up, but I don't know. If that is the problem, could someone show me how to fix it, or if it isn't, then tell me what the problem actually is, and then how to fix it? Thanks in advance!</p>  <p>Code:</p>  <pre><code>if(cameraIndex == 1){         outsideCamera.enabled = false;         driverCamera.enabled = true;         passengerCamera.enabled = false;         FPCamera.enabled = false;           float driverVolume = 0.1f * (motor.speed / motor.topSpeed) + 0.1f;         outsideCamera.GetComponent&lt;AudioSource&gt;().volume = 0f;         driverCamera.GetComponent&lt;AudioSource&gt;().volume = driverVolume;         passengerCamera.GetComponent&lt;AudioSource&gt;().volume = 0f;         FPCamera.GetComponent&lt;AudioSource&gt;().volume = 0f;          ambientSound.GetComponent&lt;AudioSource&gt;().volume = 0.5f;          if(motor.ignitionIndex == 1){             motor.engineSoundSource.volume = 0.5f;             motor.hornSoundSource.volume = 0.8f;         }           if(leftDoor.clickCount == 1){             driverCamera.GetComponent&lt;AudioSource&gt;().volume = driverVolume + ((leftDoor.transform.localEulerAngles.y) / 150) * ((motor.speed / motor.topSpeed) / 1.5f);             if(motor.ignitionIndex == 1){                 motor.engineSoundSource.volume = 0.6f;                 motor.hornSoundSource.volume = 0.9f;             }         }          //problem area below                      if(rightDoor.clickCount == 1){             driverCamera.GetComponent&lt;AudioSource&gt;().volume = driverVolume + ((((rightDoor.transform.localEulerAngles.y) - (210 + 150)) * -1) / 150) * (motor.speed / motor.topSpeed / 1.5f);             if(motor.ignitionIndex == 1){                 motor.engineSoundSource.volume = 0.6f;                 motor.hornSoundSource.volume = 0.9f;             }         }          activeCamera = driverCamera;      } </code></pre>
