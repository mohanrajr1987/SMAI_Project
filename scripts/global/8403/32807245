<p>I have a compass object which rotates and moves along with the camera. Thus the rotation and position of the compass object is adjusted along with the player-controlled camera. Now, having attached a needle to my compass - I would like to have the needle point north.</p>  <p>That is easily done but having the needle point to a northern object. But the needle now doesn't follow the plate (compass object) it is placed on. I would thus like the needle to point accordingly. In other word, rotate singly along the y-axis. </p>  <p>I don't need code - I just need a broad idea of how to do that. I would really appreciate any help :)</p>
