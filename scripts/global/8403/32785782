<p>I've got 1st person view camera, rotated by mouse movement. But when i rotate it in response to mouse motion, the camera rotates instantly, jumping from one position to another. I want it to be smooth nicely looking motion. I tried some things, some of them seem to be working a little, but thats still not smooth and not flexible. I wonder if there are some good intuitive techniques for smooth camera rotation, which would also allow me to apply some effects. I think there might be some, since it's the very basics of game development.  </p>  <p>I can't just interpolate between 2 static points, i need camera to respond to dynamic mouse motion.  </p>
