<p>I am editing an app where I added a new UIViewController to configure a multiplayer game in one layout.</p>  <p>I have added two buttons for each player (top button, bot button). Each button generates an alert at  the screen (remember it is in landscape orientation ) but the problem is, player 2 do not see the alert rotated, I mean, the alert is supposed to be shown in his orientation, in front of me.</p>  <p>As there any way to do this? I want to rotate an Alert for the player 2  will  not see the information of the alert turned.</p>  <p>Here the alert code I have:</p>  <pre><code>@IBAction func ShowAlert(){ let message = "Test" let alert = UIAlertController(title: title, message: message, preferredStyle: .Alert)  let action = UIAlertAction(title: "OK", style: .Default, handler: nil)      alert.addAction(action)      presentViewController(alert, animated: true, completion: nil) } </code></pre>
