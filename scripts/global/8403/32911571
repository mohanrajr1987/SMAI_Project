<p>I have several images of the same object in different points of views and i need the "3d" effect by swiping on my image and letting the carousel changes images without animations/transitions. I'm trying to have this effect using angular carousel because there's the "swipe" library for mobile devices (i'm working on a Ionic JS app) but if there are alternatives to this it's not a problem, i just need this effect. Can someone help me?</p>
