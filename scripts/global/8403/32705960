<p>Some USPS or FedEx labels require a large letter, and sometimes the labels must be rotated (typically 90 or 180 degrees). We discovered that one or more characters will disappear if they exceed 100 points and are rotated one or more degrees. </p>  <p>This unexpected behavior did not exist in Java 1.6. A co-worker put this in to limit this problem by restricting the font size of rotated text, but this is not a fix. FedEx will reject our labels for being out of compliance. </p>  <pre><code>float test = height * scaleH; if ( ( Direction != PositionedObject.Rotate_0 ) &amp;&amp; ( test &gt; (float)100.0 )) {     Log.trace_printf(1, "height %6.2f , %6.2f %6.2f %s", test, height, scaleH, Text);     scaleH = (float)(100.0/height); } </code></pre>  <p>This problem was addressed, but not resolved, at <a href="http://www.coderanch.com/t/647770/java/java/draw-degree-anticlockwise-rotated-text" rel="nofollow">Trying to draw 270 degree anticlockwise rotated text on an image, but having an issue</a>.</p>  <p>How can we fix this behavior?</p>
