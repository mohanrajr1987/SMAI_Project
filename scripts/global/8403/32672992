<p>I want to translate an imagebutton from "A" to "B", then, when the imagebutton is in the "B" point, I want to rotate it 180 degrees. The problem is when the imagebutton rotates, because it rotates in a semicircle (using all the screen) and it ends in the "A" point, and I want to rotate it in the point "B", where the translate finished. Here is the code: </p>  <pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt; &lt;set xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"&gt;  &lt;translate     android:fromYDelta="0"     android:fromXDelta="0"     android:toYDelta="-900"     android:duration="4500"     android:fillAfter="false"/&gt;  &lt;set android:startOffset="4500"&gt;      &lt;rotate          android:duration="4000"         android:fromDegrees="0"         android:toDegrees="180"         android:pivotX="50%"         android:pivotY="50%"/&gt;      &lt;/set&gt; &lt;/set&gt; </code></pre>  <p>It is curious, because I inverted the animation: I put first the rotation, and then the translation, and it worked perfect, but I want first the translation and then the rotation.</p>  <p>Sorry if my english is not good. I hope you could help me because I've tried a lot of ways to do this and I donÂ´t know the reason of that "Semicircle effect in the rotation". Thanks!</p>
