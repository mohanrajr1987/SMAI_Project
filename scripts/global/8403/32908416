<p>I am trying to implement <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb281649(v=vs.85).aspx" rel="nofollow">rotation</a> in and the MSDN document has suggested everywhere to use <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms904560.aspx" rel="nofollow">Vector3</a> structure to achieve this. However I get an error for both Vector3 and Quaternion saying <code>identifier not defined</code> </p>  <p>I understand this is because of not including the appropriate header file or not linking the proper library. I searched online but could not find which exact file to link and include.</p>
