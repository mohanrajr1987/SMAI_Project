<p>I've been struggling with a Phaser game for a while. I've been trying to make a mobile version of my game controls, but for reason, rotating my car character clockwise stops after reaching 0, 90, 180 or 270 degrees. Counterclockwise works just fine.</p>  <p>Here's what it looks like:</p>  <p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false"> <div class="snippet-code"> <pre class="snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>//I made a turnSpeed dependant on the car's current speed turnSpeed = speed / 6000; 		 //I then check for a boolean which is true if the button is touched  if (rightArrowLeftIsPressed) {   playerCar.rotation += turnSpeed; } if (leftArrowLeftIsPressed) {   playerCar.rotation -= turnSpeed; } //This will snap the car to 0, 90, 180 or 270 degrees if no button is pressed and the car is close to that rotation already else {   if (playerCar.rotation &lt; 0.15 &amp;&amp; playerCar.rotation &gt; -0.15)   {     playerCar.rotation = 0;   }   if (playerCar.rotation &gt; (Math.PI - 0.15) || playerCar.rotation &lt; (-Math.PI + 0.15))   {     playerCar.rotation = Math.PI;   }   if (playerCar.rotation &gt; -Math.PI / 2 - 0.15 &amp;&amp; playerCar.rotation &lt; -Math.PI / 2 + 0.15)   {     playerCar.rotation = -Math.PI / 2;   }   if (playerCar.rotation &gt; Math.PI / 2 - 0.15 &amp;&amp; playerCar.rotation &lt; Math.PI / 2 + 0.15)   {     playerCar.rotation = Math.PI / 2;   } }</code></pre> </div> </div> </p>  <p>Anyone have a clue why it would limit the clockwise rotation like that?</p>  <p>Many thanks</p>
