<p>I am trying to do something similar to this:</p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13245031/how-to-implement-cube-transition-ef%E2%80%8C%E2%80%8Bfect-animation-on-viewpager-in-android/27774196#27774196">how to implement cube Transition effect animation on ViewPager in android?</a></p>  <p>But, instead have the rotation be vertical, and have a list of the items that can rotate to reveal the bottom face.</p>  <p>I tried putting 2 layouts in a container and rotating the container:</p>  <pre><code>container.addView(view1); container.addView(view2); view2.rotation(-90.0f); //&lt;-- sit at bottom facing down  container.rotate(90.0f); //&lt;-- rotate up to show view2 </code></pre>  <p>This didn't seem to work, and I'm not able to use a 3rd party library for this project. Any advice is greatly appreciated.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
