<p>i'm using Sygic SDK in my form (.net WinForms) with Gmap.NET to display the map. I have implemented map rotation based on GPS coordinates from Sygic. To rotate the map I create 2-3 vectors from last coordinates, add them and get the angle. The problem arise when u stand on one place, the coordinates are not the same due to GPS range error so the map starts randomly rotating. </p>  <p>I could have fixed that if i had that error value, but i only found HDoP (horizontal dilution of precision) in Sygic documentation and its only the scalar to multiply error. So if coordinates are in error range i don't rotate the map.</p>  <p>Is there any trick to computer error value? Is there different implementation?</p>  <p>Sygic also provides speed within coordinates struct. Should i try to use Speed instead? So do not rotate the map if speed is 0. Don't know if that would be accurate.</p>  <p>Sygic coordinates doc:<a href="http://developers.sygic.com/reference/cs/html/class_application_a_p_i_1_1_s_gps_position.html" rel="nofollow">http://developers.sygic.com/reference/cs/html/class_application_a_p_i_1_1_s_gps_position.html</a></p>  <p>Thanks</p>
