<p>So im making an app extension and my main app is called inTime, but when i created my extension it wouldnt let me have the same file name for obvious reasons. So i called it inTime Extension. Now i want to make notification center display inTime instead of inTime extension! Ill post a screenshot to make it clearer!</p>  <p><a href="https://gyazo.com/aedb5fdcd113d1c13a4e118a9931ed15" rel="nofollow">https://gyazo.com/aedb5fdcd113d1c13a4e118a9931ed15</a> Thanks in advance</p>
