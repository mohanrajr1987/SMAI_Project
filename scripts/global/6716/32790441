<p>I'm trying to add this widget from Bands In Town - to show upcoming tour dates for a band. For some reason the bottom of the widget is getting cut off. Any advice?</p>  <p>Here is a link to the page: <a href="http://northernfaces.com/tour" rel="nofollow">http://northernfaces.com/tour</a></p>  <p>As far as the code, I believe the problem has something to do with this CSS: <code>.isotope three-column one-column permalink-page {     height: 1166px;     overflow-x: hidden;     overflow-y: hidden;     position: relative;}</code></p>  <p>With this piece of CSS, I have the height set at 1166px. However, when the page loads, the height is changed to just 175px. Why does the height change on this page? No other page within the website is cutting off like this. Any advice? Thanks!</p>  <p>Need more info? Let me know.</p>  <p>Thanks, Josh</p>
