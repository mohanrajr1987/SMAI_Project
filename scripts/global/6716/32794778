<p>I have a strange problem with a widget I developed. The widget works normally on the home screen, updating as it should. I have recently made some changes to the code, adding some more intents to the widget receiver. </p>  <p>The original intent filter for the widget was the following:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;intent-filter&gt;     &lt;action android:name="android.appwidget.action.APPWIDGET_UPDATE" /&gt; &lt;/intent-filter&gt; </code></pre>  <p>After the changes, I added the following intents:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;intent-filter&gt;     &lt;action android:name="com.basi.widget.MY_UPDATE_WIDGET" /&gt;     &lt;action android:name="android.intent.action.TIME_CHANGED" /&gt;     &lt;action android:name="android.intent.action.TIMEZONE_CHANGED" /&gt;     &lt;action android:name="android.intent.action.LOCALE_CHANGED" /&gt; &lt;/intent-filter&gt; </code></pre>  <p>and changed the widget from being updated by a service to being updated by an recurring alarm that sends the MY_UPDATE_WIDGET intent. The problem is that when I update the application, the widget stops updating and a 'Problem loading widget' appears. When I remove the widget from the home screen and add it back, it works as it should, even if I install further updates. It looks like something goes wrong with the particular update, i.e., the changing of the intents. I have checked the logcat and there are no errors but I have noticed that the onReceive intent is not firing up after the initial update so that is probably the problem.</p>  <p>What I suspect is that a widget already on a home screen knows which intents to receive - if it is not re-initialized (by removing it and adding it back), it will not listen to the new intents so that is why the problem happens. Is there a way to tell the widget to start receiving the new intents? Is it a different problem?</p>
