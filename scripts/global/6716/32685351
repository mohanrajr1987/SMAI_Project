<p>I embedded my instagram feed with <a href="http://www.snapwidget.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.snapwidget.com</a></p>  <p>Each photo is automatically a link to that website.</p>  <p>I'd like to change all image's link to a different, custom URL.</p>  <p>I have some experience with embedding, but in this case, I don't know where to start.</p>  <p>Is this even possible to do?</p>  <p>Web page where the embed is: <a href="http://www.musicbyds.com/p/photos.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.musicbyds.com/p/photos.html</a></p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
