<p><strong>Is there an element in HTML that represents an UI widget?</strong></p>  <p>I wonder if any of the semantic HTML elements is designed for widgets like draggable clocks, weather forecasts or an address book contacts?</p>  <p>Iâ€™m not sure if <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> makes sense for an interactive UI element and whether <code>&lt;dialog&gt;</code> is intended for anything other than a modal dialog or if I should stick to <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> or even <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>.</p>
