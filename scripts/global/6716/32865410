<p>Is it possible to make the Scale Widget return to the center of the scale when it is not in use?</p>  <p>Currently, if I click and drag the scale widget to one side, it will remain in that position when I unclick the slider. Is it possible to make the slider return to the center when it is unclicked / no longer being dragged?</p>  <p>Current code to work on:</p>  <pre><code>w = Scale(master, from_=0, to=1, orient=HORIZONTAL, command=some_function) w.pack() </code></pre>
