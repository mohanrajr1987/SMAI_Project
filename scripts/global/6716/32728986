<p>We are using this widget: <a href="http://captivatedev.com/2012/07/19/adobe-captivate-6-x-widget-google-lms-with-email-reporting/" rel="nofollow">http://captivatedev.com/2012/07/19/adobe-captivate-6-x-widget-google-lms-with-email-reporting/</a></p>  <p>Suddenly this morning we realised that it is no longer recording information into our google sheets. It was working fine yesterday. The company that we purchased the widget from has closed down, and I cannot find anyone to contact for support. </p>  <p>Any ideas on what might be the issue? </p>
