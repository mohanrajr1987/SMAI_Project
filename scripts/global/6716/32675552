<p>OK, got a widget that I want to load in the footer of the main content area, but I don't want it to load on page load.</p>  <p>What I'd ideally like to do is have the widget load in its position with a "click here to load button" (a holder piece of text/code), but then not actually load the widget content until that button is then clicked.</p>  <p>Any simple way to do this?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
