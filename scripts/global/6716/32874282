<p>My main goal is to be able to manage button from my custom widget.</p>  <p>I've got 3 files : </p>  <ul> <li><p>gui.py : created by pyuic4 </p></li> <li><p>code.py : which inherits gui.py and adds function to the buttons</p></li> <li><p>custom_wid.py : created by pyuic4 , my custom widget which is beeing  added to the GUI when a button  from main gui is pressed .</p></li> </ul>  <p>the custom_wid got a line edit and 2 buttons .  I want to be able to add functionally to the custom widget's button. The main problem is that i dont know how to get the functionally out from the custom_wid.py file , which i somethimes change and pyuic4 deletes it.</p>  <p>Sorry for my bad english .  </p>
