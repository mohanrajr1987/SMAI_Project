<p>I have been working on a project with minimum sdk version 9, and from project requirements, it is clear that I am going to make a home screen as well as lock screen widget, but since lock screen widget is supported only between 4.2-4.4 versions, so how am I going to implement widgets in my application...? Also can I somehow set custom icons in my home screen widgets in lower versions.</p>
