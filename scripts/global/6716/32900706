<p>I have looked all over the internet and not yet found a clear answer. Even the information on the official site is very vague and limited. It has forced me to come to one of these Q&amp;A sites to get my answer. </p>  <p>Trying to make a widget on Android Studio. where we can change the size of the widget in the widget configure activity. For example, when I put the widget on my homescreen the configure activity runs,  a spinner would select number of cells and the orientation of the widget. </p>  <p>I want to know how to let the user change the widget size according to their needs  i.e. how to specify in the widget layout xml file that it is resizeable, the java code to add in the configure activity class for changing the widget size etc. </p>
