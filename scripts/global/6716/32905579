<p>I'm using sonar 5.1.2. I created a simple quality gate and associated it to my project. Then I went on the main dashboard and added the Quality Gate widget, configured it for my project, and then saved.<br> Note, on the dashboard edition page (where you select widgets), under my new quality gate widget, it says : "No data".  </p>  <p>When I return to the dashboard I cannot see the widget.  I can successfully add other widgets, but this one just won't show itself.</p>  <p>Note that my project is a maven multi-module project (a big one).  Tried it on a smaller project and had the same problem.</p>  <p>Is there something to know about this widget that could explain why I don't see it ?</p>
