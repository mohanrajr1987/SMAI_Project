<p>There is a Zone named: AfterContent , which contains three Projection Widgets for getting the resource items ( resource items is a custom Content type created ) <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/bOc3C.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/bOc3C.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I was expecting that the order in which these 3 widgets will display on the Page will be: Third Party, Free Distributable, Copyright, because that's exactly the order of Widgets in the Zone as seen in above image. </p>  <p>But the surprising part was that the "Free Distributable Resources" appears first, "Third Party Resources" widget 2nd and "Copyright Resources" widget at 3rd.</p>  <p>PLease help me understand why the Widget at Position 2 in Zone appears at position 1 in Page ? is Orchard using some random calculation to determine the positions of widgets in a same Zone ?</p>
