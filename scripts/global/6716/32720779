<p>I have been playing around with the configurable table Esri-approved add-on for Operations Dashboard contained in the following link:</p>  <p><a href="http://energy.esri.com/dashboard-samples/tableWidgetWithConfig/" rel="nofollow">http://energy.esri.com/dashboard-samples/tableWidgetWithConfig/</a></p>  <p>The table is easily configurable and displays well within the dashboard. However, if there are too many rows of data within the table the table appears to be cut-off since there is no scroll bar within the widget box.</p>  <p>This seems like a crazy oversight, and I was wondering if anyone else has encountered the issue. I am not familiar enough with html to alter the code, although it seems like a potentially easy fix.</p>  <p>Any feedback would be appreciated. Thanks, Char</p>
