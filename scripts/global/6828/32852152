<p>What I am trying to accomplish is to make mass downloading easier. The problem is, the links are within a page that opens up in front of the main page. I have to manual click the Library and then expand it. </p>  <p>Once it's expanded, I can ctrl + A then view source to copy and paste it to a txt so that a python script can go in and extract the links. </p>  <p>After using firebug I can see the div that is related to the library window. </p>  <pre><code>&lt;div id="mapLibrary" class="modal hide in" style="display: block;" aria-hidden="false"&gt; </code></pre>  <p>The links I want to grab and create a separate html (which I can do already) resides within the div </p>  <p><code>class="libraryGrid" --&gt; &lt;table class="backgrid table table-hover table-bordered table-condensed available&gt; --&gt; &lt;tbody&gt; --&gt; &lt;tr id="subitem_#####" class="subitem"&gt; --&gt; etc etc</code></p>  <p>This continues til it gets to the actual link. How in the world can I get something to grab the links directly without a user having to open the Library and expand. </p>  <p>The only thing that kind sucks in my situation is that alot of the tools available (e.g., BS4, selenium, etc) I cannot willingly download/install them.</p>  <p>What are my options?</p>
