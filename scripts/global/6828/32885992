<pre><code>jQuery( document ).on( "click", "#starSort ", function( ) {    jQuery( ".qa-voting-bookmark.active" ).closest( ".answer" )   .prependTo( "#starbox" );    jQuery("#starbox").append(jQuery(".qa-voting-bookmark.active")   .closest( ".answer" ).get().reverse()); }); </code></pre>  <p>The above code is what I have. it works fine before the new elements are created. the current .answer elements are recreated by another function that refreshes the data.</p>  <p>i tried just going with.</p>  <pre><code>    jQuery( "#starSort" ).on( "click", function( ) {}); </code></pre>  <p>but it doesn't like it.  Though the button isn't a concern, it doesn't become dynamic. Only these .answer elements.</p>  <p>edit** My event listener targets the whole body.  But when I read about Event Delegation, all the examples are about the button and the dynamic element being the same object. I want to click a button that is not inside of the list of dynamic objects, and have it change the dynamic objects.</p>
