<p>So in this website: <a href="https://www.sohofarmhouse.com/hotel/farmyard-up" rel="nofollow">https://www.sohofarmhouse.com/hotel/farmyard-up</a></p>  <p>The background image is resized automatically when the screen size changes however the aspect ratio is always maintained.</p>  <p>My guess is it's something to do with div's within div's but please could someone break it down for me as I'd love to be able to achieve this in my own sites.</p>  <p>Many Thanks.</p>
