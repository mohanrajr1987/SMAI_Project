<p>I want to create a custom step on CRM 2015  on-prim this step calculates the failure time of SLA, which means I give it 2 Hours, so it calculates the failure time on this after 2 working hours.</p>  <p>It may be tomorrow is off and it's just 1 hour in today.</p>  <p>It respond with date of after tomorrow.</p>  <p>So I need to find the working hours and holidays.</p>  <p>How can I access this items using CRM SDK?</p>  <p>And is this the best way to calculate the failure time regarding business hours?</p>
