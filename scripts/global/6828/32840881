<p>I need some thoughts on how to improve my concept before I begin to prevent this from becoming a mile long write-only formula...</p>  <p>What I'm trying to do, graphically, is this:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ouqD6.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ouqD6.png" alt="Example"></a></p>  <p>I have two rows that have 4 mandatory cells (straight line) and 4 optional cells (dotted line) that I need to run a <code>MAX</code> function on. ANY number of the X's may contain <code>#NV</code> (for diagram purposes, these happen <strong>deliberately</strong>).</p>  <p>First, I need to determine the actual ranges. This is currently done with <code>INDIRECT(..)</code>. Depending on the current quarter it selects a range of 5 to 8 cells in the rows.</p>  <pre><code>INDIRECT("Q5:" &amp; CHAR(CODE("T") + VarQuarter) &amp; 5) </code></pre>  <p>After that, <code>MAX</code> is performed on the range and then on the previously calculated <code>MAX</code> result of the two ranges. In case of an error (because of an <code>#NV</code>), that result needs to be omitted, otherwise both results are used. Should both results be erroneous, I'm fine with the resulting error as that one will be caught later.</p>  <p>My only idea for this would be endlessly long concatenations of <code>IFERROR</code> and redundant <code>MAX</code> statements...</p>  <hr>  <p>Any ideas for improvement for any of these 2 steps? I was specifically told to perform this on the worksheet and not in code, for easier maintainability by others, so this will have to make do unless it is absolutely impossible.</p>
