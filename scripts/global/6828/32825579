<p>Suppose a dynamic UI (e.g. a slider input) B reacts to another input A and then it becomes input for table/plot output. Now, if we change input A, which causes B change, the output, in the first place, still reflects the value of B before changing A, and after a while (the refreshing time depends on how fast the output is generated and in my case, it's quite slow) the output becomes as expected. </p>  <p>I read about validate, need, observeEvent, observe, isolate, etc. I was able to get rid of the error caused by dynamic UI when first initiating the app, using validate and need. But, any one can help with this one above? Very much appreciated!</p>
