<p>I've seen a few different solutions but I can't seem to make them work. The solution I attempted is based on this question:<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22180546/jquery-hover-not-working-with-dynamic-elements">jQuery hover not working with dynamic elements</a>. I'm not seeing a distinguishable difference between the answer provided for that question and my own.</p>  <p>Here's the link for the jsfiddle that they used also: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/qgTzE/4/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/qgTzE/4/</a></p>  <p>Dynamically created element:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div class="deckCardListCard floatRight ui-corner-all" data-cardID="190563" id="1"&gt;190563&lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Javascript to add hover:</p>  <pre><code>        $(".deckCardListCard").on({             mouseenter: function() {                 $("#deckCardDisplay").css("background-image", "url('images/cards/" + $(this).attr("data-cardID") + ".png')");             },             mouseleave: function() {                 $("#deckCardDisplay").css("background-image", "url('images/layout/back.png')");             }         }); </code></pre>  <p>** EDIT **</p>  <p>I have selected an answer from below but the question is more why what I have doesn't work when the apparent same thing works here: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22180546/jquery-hover-not-working-with-dynamic-elements">jQuery hover not working with dynamic elements</a></p>
