<p>I am trying to write a function to concatenate two dynamically allocated C-style strings. Am I correct in my design that you first would have to copy the destination to a temp <code>char[]</code>, delete the original memory allocation, get the length of the two <code>char[]</code>, allocate new memory with that new length then copy the chars to the <code>dest[]</code>?</p>  <p>So pseudo code:</p>  <pre><code>void concat(char* dest, char *source) {     char temp = dest;      delete [] dest;      char dest = new char [new size];      copy temp to dest;      copy source to dest; } </code></pre>  <p>Am I fundamentally misunderstanding this?</p>
