<p>It seems like this should be easy but no luck so far. I set my Activity's main layout and then depending on which button is clicked I need to add a specific layout to end of the current main layout.</p>  <p>Main Activity:</p>  <pre><code>public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {     super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);      //live_video_layout is a vertical LinearLayout     setContentView(R.layout.live_video_layout);      //Psuedo code for clarity; these layouts are ScrollViews that will sit under live_video_layout seen above     if(button1 is clicked)       {add R.id.first_layout under live_video_layout}      else if(button2 is clicked)       {add R.id.second_layout under live_video_layout } </code></pre>  <p>Any guidance here would be greatly appreciated, I'm all out of ideas.</p>
