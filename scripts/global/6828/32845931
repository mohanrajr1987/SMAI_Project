<p>I just started using cognos 10.2.2. if you open the embedded cognos sample  Samples ‎> Models ‎> GO Sales (analysis) ‎> Report Studio Report Samples‬ > 2005 Sales Summary</p>  <p>You will see there is a top 10 sales staff.</p>  <p>How can I generate 10 separate charts for each staff with y axis to be sales and x axis to be month or any time scale. And make this to be automated.</p>  <p>As top 10 sales staff is changing all the time but I do not want to manually generate the charts.</p>
