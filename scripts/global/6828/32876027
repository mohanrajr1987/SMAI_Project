<p>I am trying to create an android app that has multiple "pages" , for example : you can choose any city in the world (e.g : Rome,Berlin,New york..), and by click on it you move to the specific city activity and get specific information, such as: country, nubmer of people.. etc (All the categories are the same, and the information changes for each city )</p>  <p>the specific information should be stored on mySQL database</p>  <p>I would like to ask - how can i implement this on an android application?</p>  <p>thanks!</p>
