<p>Hello guys I am trying to output some team standing based on the title topic of a page. </p>  <p>for instance if I click in a page that is titled the Boston Celtics which contains information about the Celtics the stored xml file loaded to that article will output Celtics standing.  </p>  <p>php is used to output the title dynamically.Please see below.</p>  <pre><code>  &lt;h1 prop="name headline"&gt;&lt;?=$topic['a_headline']?&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I want to use php to load the file and JavaScript to pull do the specific data in relation to the title.</p>  <p>How would I go about that? If you have a fiddle that would be good.</p>  <p>Thanks </p>
