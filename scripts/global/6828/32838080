<p>I'm in charge of the developpement of a webform C# asp.net application. I'm currently working on the translation of the different page and I use the globalisation, with local ressources. It's working until there but now I'm stucked with my dynamic content.</p>  <p>For exemple I got a table that's created dynamically and I have 21 possibilities of sentence in each first column. My question is how can I assign them the meta_ressource key attribute or something that could allow me to change their value depending of the user language?</p>  <p>I've seen that directly assign in code behind the attribute meta:ressource key won't work but I've no clue how to get around it.</p>  <p>Value are currently retrieve from a database, in last resort case I could add translation directly in the database next to the french name column...</p>
