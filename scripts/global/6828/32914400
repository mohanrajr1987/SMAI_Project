<p>Microsoft "recently" said that on Xbox One Halo 5 will dynamically lower resolution at which game renders to maintain 60fps.</p>  <p>At first I though: "ha-ha consoles! so lame"</p>  <p>But then I played PC MMOFPS Firefall, which has same option, basically you have one slider for minimum fps and one slider for maximum % of resolution to lower.</p>  <p>Just for fun I set it to 60fps and (lowest) 50% (which means at my 1920x1080 I allow game to downres to 960x540) and then set graphics to "Everything Ultra".</p>  <p>And I have to say: I never in my life seen game run so smooth, no matter what happened on the screen be it mass battle versus hundreds of npcs or cluttered city with dozens of highly rendered players game never went lower than 60fps. Instead it's just got a little blurry. Practically every time I normally would expect dip in fps or microlag instead it was just few blurry frames.</p>  <p>After that I wondered, why this isn't option in Nvidia/Ati drivers? And is it possible to write as separate program, which hooks to game or driver.</p>
