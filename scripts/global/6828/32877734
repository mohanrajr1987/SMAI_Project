<p>I have two years data i.e 24 months at day level  ( Jan  2014 to Dec 2015).  <strong>Use case</strong> :For all the months before october 2015, I have data for all the days. October, November , December I have data for some days and I have to calculate values for the entire month based on the current months data and last years data( last year same month i.e for october 2015 , need to check october 2015 and october 2014 data). </p>  <p><strong>Solution</strong> : I am trying to dynamically divide this dataframe into 24 dataframes ( one for each month). Steps I want to follow:</p>  <ul> <li>Extracted month, year into a new dataframe(already done) -- (did a groupby on the main  dataframe and then extracted month, year which  I stored in another dataframe)</li> <li>I want to loop through this dataframe(created above) and create 24 dataframes one for each month -- (not sure how to do that), <strong>please suggest ways or if this is not efficient alternate solution to do this</strong></li> <li>After that, create one more dataframe for each month, where I will store the results from the calculations on the data available </li> </ul>  <p>This is the solution I could think of but some times it feels convoluted. <strong>Please suggest ways to do this or if you guys have followed any alternative approach.</strong> Let me know if any point is not clear, I can provide more info. </p>
