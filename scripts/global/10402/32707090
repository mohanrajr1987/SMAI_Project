<p>I have the following two files. The first a long php script, the second just a handful of variables:</p>  <p><strong>File1.php:</strong></p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php ... function abc()     {         ...         include "File2.php";         echo "$x $y $z";         ...     } ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p><strong>File2.php:</strong></p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php $x=1; $y=2; $z=3; ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>None of the variables appear inside my function in the <code>echo</code> statement - using xdebug I step through it including the second file, each variable appears correct, but when it leaves <code>File2.php</code>, it loses all the variables.  Why would that be?</p>  <p>I've stripped the first file to get rid of everything but the above - and it works fine. I'm not sure where to start looking in the thousands of lines of code for something that could be causing this problem to happen.</p>  <p>I've even tried using <code>require</code>/<code>require_once</code> - same problem...</p>  <p>Has anyone come across this before or have any thoughts how to debug it?</p>
