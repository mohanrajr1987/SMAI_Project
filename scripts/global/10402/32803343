<p>I have recently changed my homemade framework to store the template files in the theme folder instead of a general template folder. The problem is now that I have done so, for some reason my include()'s point to the correct files but don't work. However, for some reason the theme templates include() works. </p>  <p>I receive these errors:</p>  <pre><code>Warning: require(lib/themes/original/templates/en/home/index.php): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /home/stretch045/public_html/lib/theme/original/templateen.php on line 27  Warning: require(lib/themes/original/templates/en/home/index.php): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /home/stretch045/public_html/lib/theme/original/templateen.php on line 27  Fatal error: require(): Failed opening required 'lib/themes/original/templates/en/home/index.php' (include_path='.:/usr/lib/php:/usr/local/lib/php') in /home/stretch045/public_html/lib/theme/original/templateen.php on line 27 </code></pre>  <p>I believe the last one might explain it, but I don't understand what the stuff in the brackets is supposed to mean as it isn't a path I have on my shared server.</p>  <p>If necessary I will provide code, but I don't see how that could be the problem as the path is correct.</p>
