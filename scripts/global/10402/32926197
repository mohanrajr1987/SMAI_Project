<p>I have a big list of images in a folder... <code>/images/</code> and I would like to display only certain ones. </p>  <p>A text file will have a list of images, in any format that's needed...</p>  <p>ie:</p>  <pre><code>txtfile1.txt $icon1 = 'icon1.jpg'; $icon2 = 'icon2.jpg' </code></pre>  <p>Or it could just be,</p>  <pre><code>icon1.jpg icon2.jpg </code></pre>  <p>... whatever is needed, I've tried both.</p>  <p>So on and so on...</p>  <p>I've tried a few options I found on here with reading, but I can never get them to show up as imgs. I would like to be able to have it display all images (I already have css set up to show rows of 6 [all images are the same size]) that are indicated in the txt files... so when it reaches eof, it displays no more images. I'm new to this kind of stuff.</p>  <p>Right now I just have it coded manually using HTML, but I'd like to use something like...</p>  <p><code>echo '&lt;img src="blah/images/&lt;$icon1.jpg;&gt;';</code> and have it repeat until eof... Suggestions? Thanks.</p>
