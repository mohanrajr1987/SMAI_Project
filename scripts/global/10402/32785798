<p>Let's say we have a "hello.c" file and a corresponding "hello.h" file. And let's say that it requires "stdio.h". I have searched and found ifndef is used, to prevent multiple inclusion of header files. But, I have seen people including that "stdio.h" in both "hello.c" and "hello.h". Especially in hello.h they do something like </p>  <pre><code>#ifndef _HELLO_H_ #define _HELLO_H_ #include&lt;stdio.h&gt; . . . endif </code></pre>  <p>My confusion is, what purpose does "ifndef" serve in such cases?</p>
