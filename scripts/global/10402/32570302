<p>i have written a php code. something like </p>  <pre><code>echo '&lt;textarea name="textarea" cols="75" rows="10"&gt;'.$txt.'&lt;/textarea&gt;' </code></pre>  <p>but when including the file containing this code in another file, this part of the code is printed to the screen. with the view source code option i can see that the php code included is written on the page.  I do not understand why the code is written on the page and why that part on code is visible on the page. using xampp with php 5.5.15</p>
