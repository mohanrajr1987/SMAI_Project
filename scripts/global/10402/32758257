<p>After a codebase I am working on has been converted automatically from Java to C++ (Yes, yes, I know, not a good idea, but long story made short, it was needed), I have found that in many classes I have the two following errors, related to my ClassNameXXX type:</p>  <pre><code>‘ClassNameXXX’ does not name a type </code></pre>  <p>and</p>  <pre><code>‘ClassNameXXX’ has not been declared </code></pre>  <p>I understand that the casue of the problem is a matter of cyclic inclusions between the ClassNameXXX.h header and others (and I am working hard to resolve that) but I was wondering what is the actual difference between the two error messages (Maybe this would give me some clues for the resolution of the cycles).</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
