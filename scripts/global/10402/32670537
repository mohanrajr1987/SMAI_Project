<p>This error has always annoyed me and never got to understand how to solve it, so I would like to finally learn how to do things properly.</p>  <p>So I follow this:</p>  <p>1) Create empty Win32 console application (C++)</p>  <p>2) Create main.cpp</p>  <p>3) I have a library "FreeImage.h", which I copy under "./include/FreeImage.h".</p>  <p>4) I click on Add Existing Files and add FreeImage.h to my project.</p>  <p>5) I click on Project - Properties, and in VC++ Directories, I add the absolute path to the previously mentioned "include" folder. I repeat the same operation under the C/C++ - General tab, under "Additional Include directories".</p>  <p>Then I have this in main.cpp:</p>  <pre><code>#include &lt;FreeImage.h&gt;  int main(int argc, char** argv) {    return 0; } </code></pre>  <p>Then, when I compile, it complains: "Could not find FreeImage.h". Why on earth can Visual Studio not find it? I set the absolute path to the "include" folder twice...</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
