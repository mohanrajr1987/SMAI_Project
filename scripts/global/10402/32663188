<p>I need to include a file in my C program that has a bunch of hex constants in the form:</p>  <pre><code>0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x01, 0x00, 0x18, 0x00, 0xE8, 0x01, 0xFF, 0xF2, 0x00, 0x20, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0xE2, 0x01,  </code></pre>  <p>the above file is output from another compiler (specifically the Sigma Studio for the 1701.) and will change from time to time, so I don't want to manually massage the file each time it changes.</p>  <p>What you see is a snippet of the code for the 1701, and I am programming the 1701 from another u controller. This ASCII data file wants to be included in the u controller C program.</p>  <p>The constants begin in column 1 and there are 1024 lines each containing five 8 bit constants.</p>  <p>I tried to make an asm program with an include statement, and got an error message telling my only labels may begin in column 1.</p>  <p>Ideally, I would like to start a define block, then include the file, then end the block.</p>  <p>Any ideas how I can do this?</p>
