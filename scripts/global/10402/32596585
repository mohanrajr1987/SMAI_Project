<p>Problem: I use a index.php wich includes other php files.</p>  <p>index.php declares: </p>  <pre><code>&lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"/&gt; </code></pre>  <p>All ok until here with portuguese characters "é,ç,ã".</p>  <p>When I include php files, chars are wrong encoded. With the use of utf8_encode() in the php file being included, things work fine. But, this is to much work encode every sing piece of text in several php files. So, I'm looking for a global solution.</p>  <p>I already tried: 1- use (as the first thing in the index.php file), nothing changes.</p>  <pre><code>header('Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8',true); </code></pre>  <p>2- use (as the first thing in the index.php file), in this case the include files work fine but index.php are wrong enconded now.</p>  <pre><code>header('Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso8859-1',true); </code></pre>  <p>3- insert the lines of code above everywhere in index.php and in beinginclued.php files, nothing changes.</p>  <p>Any help will be wellcome.</p>
