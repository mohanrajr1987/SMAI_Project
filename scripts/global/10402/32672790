<p>Hi currently I have a page that looks like:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;html&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;?php include blahblah;?&gt; &lt;div&gt;     &lt;?php include blahblah;?&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;     Wordswordswords &lt;/p&gt; &lt;?php include blahblah;?&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I have this as a norm across my site and it would be pretty difficult to change the format of the site later on. I was wondering if it would be acceptable to set php variables at the beginning of the document and then proceeding to require the template, for example:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php     $words = 'words words words';     $blahdi = 'more words words';     require template; ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I understand that this will work but would it be good "coding etiquette" or have any drawbacks?</p>
