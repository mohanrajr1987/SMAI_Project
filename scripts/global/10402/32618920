<p>I'm trying to create a program that uses a lot of linear algebra and OpenGL, and a colleague of mine recommended that I use the Eigen library to make things a lot simpler. After downloading and extracting the library off of Eigen's official website and I clicked on the project, found the "Link Binary with Libraries" option, went into to the folder that resulted from the unarchiving (eigen-eigen-bdd17ee3b1b3), and then found the Eigen folder. This folder contains all of the header files. </p>  <p>The library showed up on the sidebar, and when I go into the correct sub-folder the header files were all there too. According to the Eigen website, you only need the header files for the includes to work, but no matter how I set up the filepath in the include statement, even if what I can physically see what I'm including on the sidebar, XCode tells me it can't find the file. I'm using an older version of XCode 4. Any advice?</p>
