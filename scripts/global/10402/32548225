<p>I need an array in multiple pages, so I tried to make a php file where the array is printed. I used:</p>  <pre><code>file_put_contents('file.php',     '&lt;?php $order = ' . var_export($order1, true) . '; ?&gt;'); </code></pre>  <p>I was hoping that if I included this file in the files where I need the array, I could use it as <code>$order</code>, but I get an error instead. I checked <code>file.php</code> and everything looks in order. Does anyone knows what I am doing wrong?</p>
