<p>I have a context with <code>LazyLoadingEnable = false</code> and <code>ProxyCreateEnabled=false</code>.  When submitting queries I explicitly <code>.Include</code> what I want.  The issue is that some of the navigation properties are populated even if they where not included.  For example:</p>  <pre><code>context.Order.Include(o =&gt; o.OrderLines)  </code></pre>  <p><code>OrderLine</code> has a navigation property back to <code>Order</code> that is populated while it was not requested in the include.  </p>  <p>I believe I understand <em>why</em> this is happening in that the given Order is in context and as a part of relationship fix-up it is populated.</p>  <p>Based on the contents of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6251914/guidance-for-synchronising-reverse-associations-in-entity-framework-4-1/">this answer</a>, it appears that disabling change tracking should prevent this.  I have tried performing the query with <code>.AsNotTracking()</code> and setting <code>AutoDetectChangesEnabled = false</code> in the context, but these un-included navigation properties are still populated.</p>  <p>Am I missing something?</p>
