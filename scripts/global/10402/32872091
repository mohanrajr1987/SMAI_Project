<p>I'm having a problem when trying to reference a C++ library project into another (.exe), It seems like it doesn't find the include files (that were included in the library project). The library project builds just fine, but the .exe project doesn't. Here's the error (GameEngine is referenced in Editor): <a href="http://i.imgur.com/RLN4Qrr.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/RLN4Qrr.png" alt="Error"></a></p>  <p>And the said file has no errors:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/koadztF.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/koadztF.png" alt="No errors"></a></p>  <p>Here's the code from Editor.h, which is where I include the main header from the GameEngine core:</p>  <pre><code>#pragma once #include "../../../GameEngine/src/core/Game.h" using namespace ae;  class Editor : public Game { public:     GAME_CREATE(Editor);      . . . }; </code></pre>  <p>As I said, this doesn't happen in the library project, only in the .exe project where I referenced the lib project.</p>  <p>I'm actually kind of confused about this, I never actually understood how the referencing works :P</p>  <p>Thanks for your attention and help!</p>
