<p>In my model (auto-generated), I can see:</p>  <pre><code>public partial class Order {   public System.Guid OrderId { get; set; }   ...   public System.Guid ProductId { get; set; }   public virtual Product Product { get; set; } } </code></pre>  <p>However, when I try include the product into the returned set (since I'm going to need some values of it later on), there's nothing provided after intellisense.</p>  <pre><code>using (ModelContext context = new ModelContext())   return context.Orders     .Include(order=&gt;order.???)     .Where(order =&gt; order.Condition)     .ToList(); </code></pre>  <p>I re-generated the model and re-run the T4 scripts. Inclusion of the other entities work as supposed to. Can't see what I might be doing wrong.</p>
