<p>The following HTML was originally generated in a javascript function but I decided it was better to put it in a php include:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div id="formcontainer"&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Login&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;form method="post" action="index.php"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;input type="text" name="login" value="" placeholder="Email"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;input type="password" name="password" value=""placeholder="Password"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="submit"&gt;&lt;input type="submit" name="commit" value="Login"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/form&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>The original javascript function still remains but now its only role is to position "formcontainer":</p>  <pre><code>function setuploginzone() {    var head = document.getElementById("superheader");    var foot = document.getElementById("superfooter");    var headheight = head.clientHeight;    var footheight = foot.clientHeight;    var contp = document.getElementById("containerparent");    var contptop = headheight;     contp.style.top = contptop;     var h = contp.clientHeight; //get height of containerparent    var vertcenter = h/2;    var logform = document.getElementById("formcontainer");    var logformheight = logform.clientHeight;    var logformtop = vertcenter - (logformheight);     logform.style.position = "relative";    logform.style.top = logformtop; } </code></pre>  <p>Originally it was all in javascript called at the end of index.php and inserted the html into a div called "containerparent". It all worked absolutely fine when it was all in javascript but now I have created "formcontainer" in a php include the heading doesn't show and the div is not positioned as per the javascript function.</p>  <p>Any thoughts?</p>
