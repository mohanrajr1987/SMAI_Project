<p>I am using cherryPy to create a simple python web app. I plan on having a few pages with most likely identical header / footer. How can I include or merge header / footer with for example index.html static page?</p>  <p>Right now I am able to have the whole static page returned or dynamic content:</p>  <pre><code>return open('index.html') #or return("dynamic content") </code></pre>  <p>In PHP you would simply include it but in python / cherrypy there does not seem to be a simple way of achieving this. Perhaps my idea of how cherrypy works is wrong. I could go with html generated by cherrypy but I don't like the fact that I would be dealing with escaping issues just for static html, not to mention the lack of proper syntax highlighting etc...</p>  <p>What is a good way to have a common header and footer with cherrypy?</p>
