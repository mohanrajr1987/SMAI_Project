<p>Im new to QNX and and not experienced with larger software projects in general. Im trying to include the tinyXML2 library into my QNX Momentics project. I have the .cpp and the .h file of the library but I dont understand how I should correctly include these files into my project so they can be referenced from my main code(included with an #include  statement)</p>  <p>hope someone can help</p>  <p>thanks</p>
