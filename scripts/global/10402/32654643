<p>When I created batches manually or from goods movement, the program seems to be NOT passing through the codes I created in the user exit include. When I create batch and save it, it does not stop in the breakpoint inside the user exit include... that is why I concluded that the exit was not even been triggered. </p>  <p>When I debug the codes I created in the user-exit separately, all the values are in place, and there is data retrieval (sy-subrc= 0 ***my codes are correct), so it is a mystery why is it (the value retrived) not reflecting on the table MCHA(Batches)? </p>  <p>Do I need to configure or activate something??? Help with this please.</p>
