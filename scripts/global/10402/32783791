<p>I'm including stuff as follows.</p>  <pre><code>List&lt;Donkey&gt; donkeys = context.Donkeys   .Include(donkey =&gt; donkey.Monkey)   .ToList(); </code></pre>  <p>Of course, each monkey has a pointer to its donkey. However, I just noticed that there's some wonkies too and each wonkey points to its monkey. How should I perform the extra include in such case?</p>  <pre><code>List&lt;Donkey&gt; donkeys = context.Donkeys   .Include(donkey =&gt; donkey.Monkey)   .Include(donkey =&gt; donkey.Monkies.Wonkies)   .ToList(); </code></pre>  <p>The above won't work because monkies don't know of wonkies. It's a bit surprising because if we look up the monkies, we can include the wonkies into them... So I'm fairly certain I just got the syntax wrongly.</p>  <p>Is there syntax that would allow me to bring the wonkies into this picture anyway? Googling gave nothing but it could be because I can't really describe it well enough.</p>
