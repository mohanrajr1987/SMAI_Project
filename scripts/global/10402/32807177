<p>I'm working on a C++ library project. I need to include a platform specific header to get access to some <code>#defines</code>.  The catch is, I only want the platform's header visible within my my header. For those including my header, I don't want them to see the additional symbols.</p>  <p>I thought about using a C++ namespace to contain/control the symbol visibility, but it does not work (confer, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/1088290">#define statements within a namespace</a>). And as far as I know, options like <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/ld" rel="nofollow"><code>--exclude-libs,all</code></a> only applies to library symbols at link time, and not header symbols.</p>  <p>I also thought about using the symbols I need from the platform header, and then undefining all the symbols it includes. But I don't know how to wildcard <code>#undef platform_header.h/*</code>.</p>  <p>There's a similar question at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/25062122">Including a header file into a header file without exposing it's content to the includer</a>. He's doing it to limit IDE auto-completion, which is producing different answers than I need because of different requirements.</p>  <p>How can I limit the visibility of an included platform header to just my library header?</p>
