<p>I am trying to use include and exclude options in rsync to copy a directory structure, excluding most but not all of the subdirectories, based on a pattern in the directory names. But, it isn't working. It is trying to copy everything over instead of just the subfolders I want. Is my syntax wrong?</p>  <p>I have tried:</p>  <pre><code>rsync -am --include='*/*/*MPRAGE*/' --exclude='*' /parent_directory/ /destination </code></pre>  <p>Also:</p>  <pre><code>rsync -am --include='*/' --include='*/*/*MPRAGE*/' --exclude='*' /parent/ /dest </code></pre>  <p>MPRAGE is the pattern that is in the name of each folder I want copied. But these folders are three levels deep in the structure, and I want to keep the well-organized directory structure intact for these folders I want copied.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance for any tips.</p>
