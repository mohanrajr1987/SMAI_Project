<p>How can I include folder containing files into project folder in command line? For example, I have "TestProject" project. Inside it is "Children" folder. There is a folder "ChildProject" containing folders and files in "Children" folder. But it is not included in "TestProject". How can I include it programmatically, as if I would have pressed "Show All Files" button, and then pressed "Include In Project" item in popup menu?</p>
