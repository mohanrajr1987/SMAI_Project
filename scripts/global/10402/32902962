<p>I'm doing a development for a company, the company has a Class in his IIS server with HTTPS, no HTTP available and because is not a public server the SSL certificate is not valid or autosigned or something like that. I have no control or access to this server.</p>  <p>My server is a CentOS release 5.10 with PHP 5.1.6. For my development I have to include (require_once or include_once) this class create the object of the class and use their methods. But when I try to include the class I got a warning and lines later the fatal error:</p>  <pre><code>PHP Warning:  include_once(): SSL: fatal protocol error in https://192.168.0.1/class/AnyClass.php on line 1  PHP Fatal error:  Class 'AnyClass' not found in /route/control/MyClass.php on line 57 </code></pre>  <p>I supose that the class wasn't be included so obviously there is no Class to create object.</p>  <p>The question is, is there any way to make php omit or ignore the invalid SSL certificate or to make the whole OS accept this specific certificate, so php seems the certificate as valid.</p>  <p>Thanks for your help.</p>  <p>David</p>
