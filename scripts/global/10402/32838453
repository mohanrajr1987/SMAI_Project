<p>What's the correct/recommended way to include a file? I'm getting trouble with inclusion (VS2005 compiler...).</p>  <p>I know the correct way is this: </p>  <pre><code>#include "source.cpp" </code></pre>  <p>or this:</p>  <pre><code>#include &lt;source.cpp&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Could <code># include "source.cpp"</code> cause problems (added space after #)? Some of my team mates use that way and we are getting an unsolved problem.</p>  <p>The point I'm including a source file is that I'm developing under and IDE which doesn't allows to define functions in it's editor due to they'll become local functions.</p>
