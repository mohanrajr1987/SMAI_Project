<p>I have two test files in the <strong>same</strong> package. I would like gradle to run foo/ATest but not foo/BTest. Is there a way to set this up? At the moment I can't seem to exclude BTest when I include ATest. That is, this doesn't work:</p>  <pre><code>test {     java {         srcDirs 'testSrc'         include '**/foo/ATest.java'         exclude '**/foo/BTest.java'     } } </code></pre>
