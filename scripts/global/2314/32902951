<p>I've spent literally 3 hours trying to get this code to work, however whenever I try I end up in a loop and the console continuously loops. I've tried everything - I've created a function that returns just i and reassigning values but it doesn't seem to work.</p>  <p>For some reason whenever I try use logic operators it doesn't want to work on me. The values of mes->hand[x] is something like "2D,4D,3C,5C,6H,7H" and so on whilst the suit is either "H",  "C" , "D", "S" in reference to cards.</p>  <pre><code>int newtrick_value(struct Message *mes, int suit) {     int len = strlen(mes-&gt;hand);     int x = 0, i = 50, y = 0;     while (i &lt; 63) {         while(x &lt; len) {             if (((mes-&gt;hand[x] == i || mes-&gt;hand[x] == y) &amp;&amp; mes-&gt;hand[x+1] == suit)){                 if(i&gt;= 58){                     return y;                 }                    return i;             }             x++;             continue;         }         if(i &gt;= 57) {             y = determine_letter(i);                 }         i ++;         x = 0;         continue;     }     return 0; } </code></pre>
