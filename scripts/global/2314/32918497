<p>I had worked out some code for my assignment and something tells me that I'm not doing it correctly.. Hope someone can take a look at it. Thank you!</p>  <pre><code> AREA   Reset, CODE, READONLY    ENTRY    LDR  r1, = 0x13579BA0   MOV  r3, #0   MOV  r4, #0   MOV  r2, #8  Loop  CMP  r2, #0   BGE   DONE    LDR  r5, [r1, r4]   AND  r5, r5, #0x00000000   ADD  r3, r3, r5   ADD  r4, r4, #4    SUB  r2, r2, #1   B    Loop   LDR  r0, [r3] DONE  B    DONE    END </code></pre>  <p>Write an ARM assembly program that will add the hexadecimal digits in register 1 and save the sum in register 0.  For example, if r1 is initialized as follows:</p>  <pre><code>        LDR    r1, =0x120A760C </code></pre>  <p>When you program has run to completion, register 0 will contain the sum of 1+2+0+A+7+6+0+C.</p>  <p>You will need to use the following in your solution: ·         An 8-iteration loop ·         Logical shift right instruction ·         The AND instruction  (used to force selected bits to 0)</p>  <p>I know that I did not even use LSR. where should I put it? I'm just getting started on Assembly hope someone makes some improvements on this code..</p>
