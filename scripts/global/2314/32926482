<p>I have a JSON object (<code>tbls</code>) which contains an array called <code>sections</code>. This array contains titles (<code>n</code>) and IDs (<code>viewid</code>) of "rooms" that are also a part of the JSON object. This means you can do <code>tbls.[roomid]</code> and get the array that contains the objects of each room. I have a hard time making this work in Angular.</p>  <p>It was built this way because it makes it easy to work with when it comes to UITableViews in iOS (where it's implemented and works). Therefore I cannot change the data. I tried below solution, but that gives me an error. Is there an effective way to do this in Angular?</p>  <pre><code>&lt;tbody data-ng-repeat="section in tbls.sections"&gt;     &lt;tr&gt;         &lt;td&gt;{{::section.n}}&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;/tr&gt;      &lt;tr data-ng-repeat="table in tbls.{{section.viewid}}"&gt;         &lt;td&gt;{{::table.n}}&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt; </code></pre>  <p>JSON JSFiddle: <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/Lu2ocqku/" rel="nofollow">https://jsfiddle.net/Lu2ocqku/</a> Edit: removed tableObj as it's not relevant to the question and doesn't match data example exactly. Same logical problem though.</p>
