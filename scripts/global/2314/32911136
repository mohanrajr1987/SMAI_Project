<p>I would like to make several lists of numbers and then concatenate them i.e.</p>  <p>list 1 = 1, 1, 1, 1</p>  <p>list 2 = 2, 2, 2, 2</p>  <p>list 3 = 3, 3, 3, 3</p>  <p>final list = 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3</p>  <p>I tried the following to create lists 1 to 3 </p>  <pre><code>ageseq &lt;- c(1,2,3) n &lt;- 3 n2 &lt;- 4  for (i in 1:n){   for (j in 1:n){     age[i] &lt;- c(rep(ageseq[j],n2))   }   } </code></pre>  <p>which produces the following error,</p>  <pre><code>In age[i] &lt;- c(rep(ageseq[j], n2)) :   number of items to replace is not a multiple of replacement length </code></pre>  <p>as age1, age2 and age3 do not exist. </p>  <p>What in my code is missing? In reality I need to concatenate over 70 lists of numbers.</p>
