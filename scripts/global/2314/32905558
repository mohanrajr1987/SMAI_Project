<p>Please see my code below. If the parameter <code>p_cust_id</code> is not in the column <code>cust_id</code> I want "0" to be printed out (which means not logged in). If it is in <code>cust_id</code> I want oracle to continue the second part of the code (the part below the empty row).</p>  <p>I have tried to solve this by inserting the values of column <code>cust_id</code> in a cursor and then inserting it in the variable <code>v_cust_id</code>. Perhaps this results in unnecessarily much code?</p>  <p>My problem is that the program does not seem to run the second part even if <code>p_cust_id</code> is in <code>cust_id</code>. It just prints out "0" even though the customer ID and the password are correct.</p>  <p>Before I added the cursor the program worked as it was supposed to, unless the parameter <code>p_cust_id</code> didn't match any value in the <code>cust_id</code> column. If this was the case nothing was printed out.</p>  <pre><code>create or replace function log_in(   p_cust_id in customer.cust_id%type,   p_passwd in customer.passwd%type) return varchar2 as   cursor c_cust_id is select cust_id from customer;   v_cust_id customer.cust_id%type;   v_passwd customer.passwd%type;   v_logged_in number(1);   v_not_logged_in number(1); begin v_logged_in := 1; v_not_logged_in := 0; if not c_cust_id%isopen then open c_cust_id; end if; loop   fetch c_cust_id   into v_cust_id;   exit when c_cust_id%notfound; end loop; if p_cust_id not in(v_cust_id) then   return v_not_logged_in; end if; close c_cust_id;  select passwd into v_passwd from customer where cust_id = p_cust_id; if v_passwd = p_passwd then  return v_logged_in; else  return v_not_logged_in;  end if; end; </code></pre>
