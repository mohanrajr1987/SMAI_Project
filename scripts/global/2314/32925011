<p>I'm looping through a 2D array of Cell objects and checking each object's surrounding Cells. Before checking each cell, I need to make sure it exists within the array. To do so I'm using the following function:</p>  <pre><code>bool Cell::isInBounds(int h, int w) {     if ((h &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; w &gt;= 0) || (h &lt; HEIGHT &amp;&amp; w &lt; WIDTH)) {         return true;     }     return false; } </code></pre>  <p>It seems to be returning true when it shouldn't, and I feel like I'm missing something obvious. <code>i</code> and <code>h</code> are being passed, for example, as <code>cell[i+1][j+1].isInBounds((i+1), (j+1))</code>.</p>  <p>New to C++. What am I doing wrong here?</p>
