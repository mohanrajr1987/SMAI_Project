<p>I'm having trouble with my code. I have to make a simple choice game and I need to have it so that if a user inputs an invalid option that it pauses the story until they choose a valid response. I tried wrapping the whole thing in a while(1==1) and entering invalid responses in he console window and it printed out "That wasn't an option" infinitely. How do I remedy this?? Thanks.</p>  <pre><code>         // First choice, scene 1 if-statements         while (1 == 1)         {             String firstScene = Console.ReadLine();             firstScene = firstScene.Trim();             String firstChoice = firstScene.ToLower();             Console.WriteLine();              if (firstChoice == "rudely")             {                 assholeFactor++;                 Console.WriteLine("&gt;&gt;\"You're damn right it was! We've been working on this for years. I thought you'd be happy that all those hours at the office actually amounted to something.\" (Douche factor increased)");                 break;             }             if (firstChoice == "nicely")             {                 niceFactor++;                 Console.WriteLine("&gt;&gt;\"No, it wasn't silly. I can see where you're coming from. I suspect there will be a lot of people with those same type of questions upon the release of the first model.\" (Nice factor increased)");                 break;             }             if (firstChoice == "silence")             {                 judgement--;                 Console.WriteLine("&gt;&gt;You sip your wine and say nothing. (Judgement decreased)");                 break;             }             if (firstChoice != "rudely" || firstChoice != "nicely" || firstChoice != "silence")             {                 Console.WriteLine("That wasn't an option.");                 continue;             }         } </code></pre>
