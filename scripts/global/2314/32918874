<p>I wanted to make an image and I figured this was the quickest way.  The idea is that there are rows with lines 5 pixels high, and every new row, the amount of pixels in between the lines are 1 pixel more than the previous row.  It's been a while since I have used java and this is so far what I came up with </p>  <pre><code>size(800,800);  int z = 2; int w = 5; int max = 800; for(int y = 0;y&lt;max;y++){   for(int x = 0;x&lt;max;x=x+z){     point(x,y);     if(y%10 == 0)z++;   } } </code></pre>  <p>This code is not quite giving me what I expected, and I can't figure out why.  any help would be appreciated</p>
