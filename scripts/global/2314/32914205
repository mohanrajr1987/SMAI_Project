<p>I'm trying to find all diagonally valid squares on a grid and set their value to 1. Diagonal is defined like  Bishop's movement in chess.</p>  <p>I've got something that works, currently, but it feels very clunky. Mostly since I am doing a lot of checking to make sure the diagonal squares in question are within the bounds of the array.</p>  <p>The grid is 8x8...</p>  <h1>eliminate diagonals</h1>  <pre><code>        for j in range (1,8):             diagx1 = randx + j             diagx2 = randx - j             diagy1 = randy + j             diagy2 = randy - j             if diagx1 &lt;= 7:                 if diagy1 &lt;= 7:                     setSquare(squares, diagx1, diagy1, 1)                 if diagy2 &gt;= 0:                     setSquare(squares, diagx1, diagy2, 1)             if diagx2 &gt;= 0:                 if diagy1 &lt;= 7:                     setSquare(squares, diagx2, diagy1, 1)                 if diagy2 &gt;= 0:                     setSquare(squares, diagx2, diagy2, 1) </code></pre>
