<p>I have a loop that is pulling all of the news out, however there is three main stories set by ACF. These are Main, Secondary and Third. This wouldn't be a problem if there was only one post set to each field. However, the client wants to be able to just set a new Main post without having to worry about removing the old ones.</p>  <p>So to make that work I'm trying to get the loop to ignore the first of these three fields, while showing the rest AND the other posts that are set to 'No'.</p>  <p>I'm trying something like this but I just cannot see how else to do it.</p>  <pre><code>$args = array(                 // 'offset' =&gt; 1,                 'posts_per_page' =&gt; -1,                  'meta_query' =&gt; array(                     array(                         'offset' =&gt; 1,                         'key'       =&gt; 'main_story',                         'value'     =&gt; 'Secondary',                         'compare' =&gt; 'NOT',                         )                     ),                  'meta_query' =&gt; array(                     array(                         'offset' =&gt; 1,                         'key'       =&gt; 'main_story',                         'value'     =&gt; 'Third',                         'compare' =&gt; 'NOT',                         )                     ),                  'meta_query' =&gt; array(                     array(                         'offset' =&gt; 1,                         'key'       =&gt; 'main_story',                         'value'     =&gt; 'Main',                         'compare' =&gt; 'NOT',                         )                     ),                 ); </code></pre>  <p>I know offset removes the ability to paginate which is important, but I saw <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Making_Custom_Queries_using_Offset_and_Pagination" rel="nofollow">https://codex.wordpress.org/Making_Custom_Queries_using_Offset_and_Pagination</a> and also was told a way to go around this. This part is more important for the time being. </p>
