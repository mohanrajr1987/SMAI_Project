<p>I am working with over 20 000 .nc files with file names who are related to the date e.g. 'jkl1999010100.nc' (year 1999, january 1th, at 0 hours) and I want to select from this data the files of the month July (07) for 10 years to perform a loop with this data. I tried some different things using the *, but this did not seem to work. Can I select this on another way, without like counting the amount of files?</p>
