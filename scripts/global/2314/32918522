<p>I know very little on Python, but I'm quite experienced in C++. I was looking for an algorithm that would loop through the points in a hexagon pattern and found one written in Python that seems to be exactly what I need. The problem is that I have no idea how to interpret it.</p>  <p>Here is the Python code:</p>  <pre><code>for x in [(n-abs(x-int(n/2))) for x in range(n)]:     for y in range(n-x):         print ' ',     for y in range(x):         print ' * ',     print </code></pre>  <p>I'd show you my attempts but there are like 30 different ones that all failed (which I'm sure are just my bad interpretation).</p>
