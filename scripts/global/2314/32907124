<p>I have a script that I have written that downloads data, and sorts it out. It then needs to put that into a mysql database.</p>  <p>The Issue comes in when reading data from the file and inserting it into a dictionary. Instead of reading the first 12 lines, and entering them into the DB  (which is 12 column's Wide, so 1 line per Column)</p>  <p>It is looping though. So instead of a for each, I need to either read the data in groups of 12, and process. Or maybe there is another way I have not thought of that anyone could help me out with.</p>  <p>data.txt</p>  <pre><code>A : 34 B : 234 C : DFG D : SG E : 452435 F : 4 G : 34554 H : foo I : bar J : 41234 K : lkjdfg L : 134243 </code></pre>  <p>script</p>  <pre><code>d = {} with open("data.txt") as f:     for line in f:         (key, val) = line.split(": ")         Id[key.strip()] = val.strip()          print(d.get("A"))         print(d.get('B'))         print(d.get('C'))         print(d.get('D'))         print(d.get('E'))         print(d.get('F'))         print(d.get('G'))         print(d.get('H'))         print(d.get('I'))         print(d.get('J'))         print(d.get('K'))         print(d.get('L'))  params = d.get('A'), d.get('B'), d.get('C'), d.get('D'), d.get('E'), d.get('F'), d.get('G'), d.get('H'), d.get('I'), d.get('J'), d.get('K'), d.get('L') </code></pre>  <p>I am new to python, and figuring it out as I go. So if this is something very obvious, please forgive me.</p>
