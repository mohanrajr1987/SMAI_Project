<p>I know to use for loops when loop variable is integer. I strongly needed to make a for loop where loop variable will take the values A00, A01, ..., A99, B00, B01, B99, ..., Z99. Are we allowed to use mixed patterns as the values of loop variables in C#? </p>  <p>How can we increment the loop variable in such a situation? Draft of what I wanted to do:<br>     <em>for (string i = A00, A01, ...,Z99; ???; ???)<br> {...}</em></p>  <p>If we are not allowed to use such values as the loop variable, what can be done to handle the situation?</p>  <p>Any ideas?</p>
