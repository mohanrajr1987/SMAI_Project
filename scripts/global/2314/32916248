<p>i am writing a "while" loop method like below:</p>  <p>objective: find the position of the first letter that's a vowel in a give word "stackoverflow"</p>  <pre><code>vowels = ["a","e","i","o","u",] word = "stackoverflow" n = 0     while vowels.include? word[n] == false     n += 1     end print n </code></pre>  <p>question: why would n return to be 0? as opposed to 2 which is the first "o" letter in "stackoverflow</p>
