<p>Im trying to sort the hashmap by value that looks like this.</p>  <pre><code>Map&lt;String,LinkedHashSet&lt;String&gt;&gt; map = new HashMap&lt;String,LinkedHashSet&lt;String&gt;&gt;(); </code></pre>  <p>the keys are string, so I attempt to sort by the first value, which is represented as string, stored in the LinkedHashset. the input looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>key:    values: Brian | 18  male student Christal | 20 female student </code></pre>  <p>can anyone show me how to sort the hash map by LinkedHashset values? any help is greatly appreciated.</p>
