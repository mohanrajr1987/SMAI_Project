<p>Supposing i have the following data structure:</p>  <pre><code>Map&lt;String, ObjectA&gt; map; </code></pre>  <p>and the ObjectA:</p>  <pre><code>class ObjectA {    String a;    String b;    int c;     } </code></pre>  <p>My final goal is to return just:</p>  <pre><code>Map&lt;String, String&gt; </code></pre>  <p>In which the first String is the same as the original, and the second String is the 'String a'. What transformations do i need to accomplish this?</p>  <p>If this was a list, i would have used Observable.from(), take what i want from the single items and then at the end join them together with toList(). But this is a map and i have never nor do i know how to perform iteration over maps in RxJava. Any help would be appreciated</p>  <p>Edit. I know i can do this using Observable.create and use the normal Java/way of doing it like the first answer states. What i really want to know is if there are any Rx Operators that allow me to do that, like Observable.from, flatMap and toList, if i was transforming lists</p>
