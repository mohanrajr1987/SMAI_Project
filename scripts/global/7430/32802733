<p>I was given a declaration of HashMap which goes like this:</p>  <pre><code>HashMap&lt;String, T*&gt; resources; //given by my professor </code></pre>  <p>Provided also was this remove function <em>void removeResource(T* a)</em> and the goal of this function is to search the map for parameter (a) and if it finds that parameter, it removes the value and key associated with it from the map.</p>  <p>So what I've did is this:</p>  <pre><code>void removeResource(T* a) //function part given by my professor         {             //find the resource and remove it from the map              for (auto it = resources.begin(); it != resources.end(); it++){                 if (resources.at(it) == a)                     resources.erase(it);             }         } </code></pre>  <p>The Visual Studios compiler was complaining pointing to <em>if (resources.at(it) == a)</em>.</p>  <p>Please help me out on where I've done wrong.</p>
