<p>I have a HashMap which has keys as Date in Strings and value as an ArrayList of Custom objects. I want to sort this hashmap on the basis of key. How can I do that?</p>  <pre><code>HashMap&lt;String,List&lt;ClassName&gt;&gt; hashmp = new HashMap&lt;String,List&lt;ClassName&gt;&gt;(); </code></pre>  <p>When Hashmp is like this.</p>  <pre><code>{"2015/07/15 : List("Object1","object2","object3") "2015/07/14 :List("Object4" , "Object5")} </code></pre>  <p>Please suggest</p>
