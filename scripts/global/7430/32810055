<p>For a homework assignment which is stated as:</p>  <p>In this homework, you will implement a key-value hash map with a external chaining collision policy. A hash map maps keys to values and allows O(1) average case lookup of a value when the key is known. This hash map must be backed by an array of initial size 11, and must have a size of 2n + 1 when the table exceeds (greater than, not greater than or equal to) a load factor of 0.67. The array must be resized before the new key (regardless of whether or not itâ€™s a duplicate) is actually added into the array. The load factor and initial size values are provided as constants in the interface and should be used within your code.</p>  <p>We're given a MapEntry class already written, and a HashMap class to write up. How would I intialize this array? <code>private MapEntry&lt;K, V&gt;[] table = new MapEntry&lt;&gt;[STARTING_SIZE];</code> doesn't work because of the generics situation.</p>
