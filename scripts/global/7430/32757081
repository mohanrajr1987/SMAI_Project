<p>I have to do an exercise and I need a little bit of help.</p>  <p>I have two objects called teacher1 and teacher2 with the attributes name and age:</p>  <pre><code>Teacher teacher1 = new Teacher(); Teacher teacher2 = new Teacher(); teacher1.newTeacher("David", 26); teacher2.newTeacher("Douglas", 26); </code></pre>  <p>newTeacher is a constructor of the class Teacher, contained in another class called Teacher.class, that contains</p>  <pre><code>public class Teacher {  String name; int age;      public void newTeacher(String n, int a) {         name = n;         age = a;     }      public String getName() {         return name;     }      public int getAge() {         return age;     } } </code></pre>  <p>I have to put each one in a different Map with a String as key:</p>  <pre><code>HashMap&lt;String, Object&gt; map1 = new HashMap&lt;String, Object(); HashMap&lt;String, Object&gt; map2 = new HashMap&lt;String, Object(); map1.put("123A",teacher1); map2.put("456B",teacher2); </code></pre>  <p>Then I have to access them from each Map and compare their attributes.</p>  <p>Can you help me with this last step?</p>
