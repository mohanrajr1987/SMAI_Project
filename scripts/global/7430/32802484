<p>I have been given an assignment to change to upgrade an existing one.</p>  <p>Figure out how to recode the qualifying exam problem using a Map for each terminal line, on the assumption that the size of the problem is dominated by the number of input lines, not the 500 terminal lines</p>  <p>The program takes in a text file that has number, name.  The number is the PC number and the name is the user who logged on.  The program returns the user for each pc that logged on the most.  Here is the existing code</p>  <pre><code>public class LineUsageData {     SinglyLinkedList&lt;Usage&gt; singly = new SinglyLinkedList&lt;Usage&gt;();       //function to add a user to the linked list or to increment count by 1     public void addObservation(Usage usage){         for(int i = 0; i &lt; singly.size(); ++i){             if(usage.getName().equals(singly.get(i).getName())){                 singly.get(i).incrementCount(1);                 return;             }         }          singly.add(usage);     }     //returns the user with the most connections to the PC     public String getMaxUsage(){         int tempHigh = 0;         int high = 0;         String userAndCount = "";         for(int i = 0; i &lt; singly.size(); ++i){//goes through list and keeps highest             tempHigh = singly.get(i).getCount();             if(tempHigh &gt; high){                 high = tempHigh;                 userAndCount = singly.get(i).getName() + " " + singly.get(i).getCount();             }         }          return userAndCount;     } } </code></pre>  <p>I am having trouble on the theoretical side.  We can use a hashmap or a treemap.  I am trying to think through how I would form a map that would hold the list of users for each pc?  I can reuse the Usage object which will hold the name and the count of the user.  I am not supposed to alter that object though</p>
