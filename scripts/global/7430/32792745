<p>I have a directory of people in a class.The hashmap mapfn is  where the string is the name of the student and Student is a class containing name,phone,address etc,id.I need to find student given the name and I have written a method like this</p>  <pre><code>  public  void   searchByName(String    Name){         Student stud= mapfn.get(firstName);     } </code></pre>  <p>But the name is not unique.At that key of Name,I need to find all the Student entries and be able to return the Linkedlist of all the Student records at that key.How can iterate through them?</p>
