<p>I have this hashmap of students which stores the id, name and last name. So I created this : </p>  <pre><code>Map&lt;Interger, HashMap&lt;String,String&gt;&gt; students = new HashMap&lt;&gt;(); </code></pre>  <p>where the second hashmap stores the name and lastname. My goal is to look for a student in a swing application, I succeed in searching with id because it's the key of the first hashmap, but i'd like to use all of them like this:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/42bgc.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/42bgc.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p><strong>So my question is :</strong> If I want to search by name or last name, how can i get the value of the first hashmap and put it in a new hashmap ?</p>
