<p>I currently have an expandable list view that is populating just fine. However when the child view is filling it creates individuals views and rows for each entry. I would like to have one view and multiple textviews in the view as well as a button that I will be adding. The data is being populated from a HASHMAP. I have tried many things and cannot get multiple textviews to populate correctly in the listview.  All data comes from this hashmap:</p>  <pre><code> private HashMap&lt;String, List&lt;String&gt;&gt; _deviceDetails; </code></pre>  <p>This is the get child view method of my custom adapter.</p>  <pre><code>@Override public View getChildView(int groupPosition, final int childPosition,                          boolean isLastChild, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) {      final String childText = (String) getChild(groupPosition, childPosition);      if (convertView == null) {         LayoutInflater infalInflater = (LayoutInflater) this._context                 .getSystemService(Context.LAYOUT_INFLATER_SERVICE);         convertView = infalInflater.inflate(R.layout.list_item, null);     }      TextView txtListChild = (TextView) convertView             .findViewById(R.id.lblListItem);      txtListChild.setText(childText);     return convertView; } </code></pre>  <p>This is an image of what I have now with what I wish to do.  <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/mqCdY.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/mqCdY.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I need the data highlighted inside of one row so that I can add buttons etc without a bunch of rows. I genuinely cannot figure out how to do this properly. </p>
