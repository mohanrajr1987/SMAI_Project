<p>Say I have a map with multi-attribute values, of which I want to select a specific attribute.</p>  <p>For instance, a map representing a table of people with name, gender, age, description.</p>  <p>In SQL, I would write "select age from people where name='whomever'"</p>  <p>How would I get that effect in Scala?</p>  <pre><code>val people = Map(  "Walter White" -&gt; ("male",52,"bad boy"),  "Skyler White" -&gt; ("female",42,"morally challenged mom")  )  // equivalent of select * from people. This works. for ((name,(gender,age,desc)) &lt;- people) println(s"$name is a $age year old $gender and is a $desc")  // what should be the syntax to get "the age of Walter White is 52"? // in SQL, it would be "'The age of Walter White is ' || (select age from people where name='Walter White')" // what would it be in Scala? println("The age of Walter White is " + people("Walter White")(1)) // not this! </code></pre>
