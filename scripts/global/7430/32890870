<p>I am writing a MR code to perform Regex pattern match for data that is available in HBASE and HDFS. My input file is a large CSV file that has the keys to fetch the unique data from HBASE. This input file can have duplicates. </p>  <p>My question -  In my Main class - I want to read the Input file and perform some processing and hold the data into a hashmap before feeding it to mapper class.  Of all the examples, I had seen, we can input only file path as input to mapper class,  is there a way to input an hashmap to mapper instead of a file?</p>  <p>Thank You Pranay Vyas</p>
