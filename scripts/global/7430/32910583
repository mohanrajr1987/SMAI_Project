<p>I got a java question asked in an interview. Print distinct characters in a string and print stars (*) under each character which shows how many times the character repeated in that string.</p>  <p>For eg: my string is "GOOGLE", then the output should be </p>  <pre><code>G O L E * * * * * * </code></pre>  <p>I tried in java and I was able to create a HashMap which will store the Character and Number of repetitions in the string. But the HashMap is not based on the Insertion order of the string. Also I don't know what should be my next step. Can someone help me? Thanks in advance</p>  <pre><code>public void myFunction(String str) {     int length = str.length();     HashMap&lt;Character, Integer&gt; hm = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();     for(int i=0;i&lt;length;i++){         char ch = str.charAt(i);         if(hm.containsKey(ch)){             hm.put(ch, hm.get(ch)+1);                        }         else {             hm.put(ch, 1);         }       }         System.out.println(hm); }  OUTPUT - Enter a String:  GOOGLE {E=1, G=2, L=1, O=2} </code></pre>
