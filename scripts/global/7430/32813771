Each student should have an array of ten quizmarks basically. And i'm insanely stuck. </p>  <p>I apologize i'm trying to work on the formatting but its only my second time here and I completely forget how to format, its giving me major issues and i'm trying to follow the instructions as best as I can.</p>
