<p>HashMap produces a hashCode using the key user submits. Following can be two cases:</p>  <p>1) If two keys (Object) are same:</p>  <p>for instance </p>  <pre><code>hashmap.put(1,"one"); hashmap.put(1,"another one"); </code></pre>  <p>Now , initially "one" will be inserted and then it will be overridden by "another one".</p>  <p>2) If the hashCode for two different objects are same: for instance , if I have a bucket of size 5 and I try to:</p>  <pre><code>hashmap.put(5,"this is five"); hashmap.put(25,"this is twenty five"); </code></pre>  <p>since hash % (SIZE-1) will point to the same location , LinkedList will be created to store the values as: <code>"this is twenty five" -&gt; "this is five"</code></p>  <p>Please correct me if I am wrong</p>
