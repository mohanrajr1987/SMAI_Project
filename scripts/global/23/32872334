<p>I have a table that, for our purposes here, has 2 columns, the first that represents the group in the second column. It's not a conventional way to group data, but it's what I have to work with. Here is a test view of the table:</p>  <pre><code>mfr_code  |  group ABC       |  ABC,FFF,XYZ DEF       |  DEF,GGG GHI       |  GHI,PPP,RRR </code></pre>  <p>I need to have a JOIN that links to the mfr_code column and then determines all of the individual mfr_codes in the second column.</p>  <p>The table this table would be joining to would look something like this:</p>  <pre><code>from_catcode  |  partno  |  mfr_code DORC          |  1234    |  ABC </code></pre>  <p>Once joined, I need to be able to produce a table that looks like:</p>  <pre><code>from_catcode  |  partno  |  mfr_code DORC          |  1234    |  ABC DORC          |  1234    |  FFF DORC          |  1234    |  XYZ </code></pre>  <p>I have been trying to figure out how to parse this multivalued column, but I fear a loop is impractical because we're talking about looping through each record of both tables, one inside the other, for tens of thousands of records.</p>  <p>Any insight or direction of where I can study up further on this would be helpful.</p>
