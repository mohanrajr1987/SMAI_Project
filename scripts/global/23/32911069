<p>I am creating a SQL Server job and I need to have proper time values to accomplish my goal. </p>  <p>I will be running this job every 7 days and I will be inserting a set of dates into a table as long as the date is less than today's date + 7 days. </p>  <p>I also want to add these dates at specific times. </p>  <p>The start of my day should be at 09:00 am and the end of the day should be at 17:00pm</p>  <p>Each insert should be 15 minutes apart and must never go past the end time</p>  <p>My code so far:</p>  <pre><code>    CREATE PROCEDURE TimeslotPublication     AS     BEGIN         -- SET NOCOUNT ON added to prevent extra result sets from         -- interfering with SELECT statements.         SET NOCOUNT ON;          DECLARE @Today date = GETDATE()         DECLARE @WeekAhead datetime          SET @WeekAhead = dateadd(day,+7,@Today)          DECLARE @startTime datetime         DECLARE @endTime datetime          WHILE @Today &lt; @WeekAhead         BEGIN          SET @startTime = '2015-10-02 09:00' --- todays date at 09:00. needs to be set to @today but at the specific time, how do i accomplish this?         SET @endTime = '2015-10-02 17:00' ---- todays date at 17:00. needs to be set to @today but at the specific time, how do i accomplish this?          WHILE @startTime &lt; @endTime         BEGIN          INSERT INTO TimeSlots (Id, Start, [End],EmployeeId) VALUES(@@IDENTITY,@startTime, @endTime, 123)          SET @startTime = '2015-10-02 09:15' ---- increase by 15 minutes needs to be set to @today but with a 15min increase, how do i accomplish this?          END          SET @Today = dateadd(day,+1,@Today)          END GO </code></pre>  <p>Obviously I do not want to use hardcoded values and SQL is not my strong side.  How can I accomplish this?</p>  <p>NOTE I use "WHILE" here, I am not sure if this is the best way to do this and appreciate any advice. </p>  <p>EDIT: <code>@starttime</code> and <code>@endTime</code> need to be set to <code>@today</code> but at a specific time.</p>  <p>And then I also need to increase the time by 15 minutes. My question is simply how do I implement this correctly in T-SQL?</p>
