<p>Let's say I have a table with 2 columns (<strong>a</strong>, <strong>b</strong>) with following values:</p>  <pre><code> a     b ---   ---  1     5  1    NULL   2    NULL  2    NULL  3    NULL </code></pre>  <p>My desired output: </p>  <pre><code> a ---  2  3 </code></pre>  <p>I want to select only those distinct values from column <strong>a</strong> for which every single occurrence of this value has NULL in column <strong>b</strong>. Therefore from my desired output, "1" won't come in because there is a "5" in column <strong>b</strong> even though there is <strong>a</strong> NULL for the 2nd occurrence of "1".</p>  <p>How can I do this using a TSQL query?</p>
