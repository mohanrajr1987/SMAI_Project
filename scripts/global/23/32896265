<p>I have a situation here where I have a deployed rdl file in the reporting server. The rdl file in question has a parameter. </p>  <p>I am using the rs.exec component to execute the report; whenever I remove the parameter from the rdl file, I successfully run the report from the stored procedure. When I add the parameter, all I keep getting is </p>  <pre><code>\\server\R\subfolder\working\inputfile\example.batK00WE is not recognized as an internal or external operable program or batch file. </code></pre>  <p>Here is what I did: I created a .rss file in VB (Please see code below)</p>  <pre><code> Public Sub Main()      TRY       DIM historyID as string = Nothing      DIM deviceInfo as string = Nothing      DIM extension as string = Nothing      DIM encoding as string      DIM mimeType as string = "application/Excel"      DIM warnings() AS Warning = Nothing      DIM streamIDs() as string = Nothing      DIM results() as Byte       rs.Credentials = System.Net.CredentialCache.DefaultCredentials      rs.LoadReport(REPORTSERVER_FOLDER, historyID)       results = rs.Render(FORMAT, deviceInfo, extension, mimeType, encoding, warnings, streamIDs)       DIM stream As FileStream = File.OpenWrite(FILENAME)      stream.Write(results, 0, results.Length)      stream.Close()      Catch e As IOException       Console.WriteLine(e.Message)     End Try End Sub </code></pre>  <p>Afterwards... I wrote batch file that utilizes the rs.exec. Please see below:</p>  <pre><code>"\\server\R\subfolder\working\app\rs.exe" -i \\server\R\subfolder\working\inputfile\coo.rss -s "http://server/ReportServer_MSSQLSERVER2" -v FILENAME="\\server\R\subfolder\working\inputfile\file.csv" -v REPORTSERVER_FOLDER="/FILE_REPORT/FILE" -t  -v FORMAT="EXCEL" -e Exec2005 </code></pre>  <p>If you see the above script the rs.exec utilizes the path of the report server etc.</p>  <p>Finally I created a stored procedure that will run the report on the server and pass into the server the parameter value. </p>  <pre><code>CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[test_sproc] @ProcessID varchar(50)  AS  DECLARE @cmdsql varchar(1000) Declare @id  varchar(50) Set     @id=@SID Set     @cmdsql= '"\\server\R\subfolder\working\inputfile\example.bat"' + @id exec master..xp_CMDShell @cmdsql </code></pre>  <p>So here is my question is: How do I pass the parameter value from stored procedure to the report server? Where did I go wrong with my code?</p>
