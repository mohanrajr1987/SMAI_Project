<p>I am trying to bring databases from different instance/server (MSSQL 2008 R2) to single MSSQL Server/Instance. </p>  <p>Existing databases have cross references/linked server used in code, so when I will simply be restoring databases from source to consolidated Target Instance.</p>  <p>would they be get created successfully irrespective of any cross databases dependencies or linked server references ? Linked server will be created as a next task to make databases fully functional.</p>  <p>I have tried creating database copies on target and backup restore from source is failing due to external references</p>
