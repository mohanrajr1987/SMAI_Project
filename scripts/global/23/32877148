<p>I found this post on stackoverflow, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17934318/add-a-summary-row-with-totals">Add a summary row with totals</a></p>  <p>What I'm trying to accomplish is just that, but with the converted DURATION field I have listed in this WITH statement below. I'm trying to TOTAL up the Durations column for that day(24 hr period). I don't know if it's possible. Let me know. Thank you!</p>  <pre><code>;WITH dupes AS (     SELECT          CALLER_PHONE, DIALED_PHONE     FROM          dbo.PBXDATA     GROUP BY          CALLER_PHONE, DIALED_PHONE ) SELECT      c.CALL_TIME, c.SALES_REP, c.CALL_TYPE, c.FLAG1,      COALESCE(NULLIF(c.FLAG3, 'NULL'),'') AS FLAG3,      ISNULL(dupes.CALLER_PHONE, '') + ISNULL(dupes.DIALED_PHONE,'') AS PHONE,      CONVERT(VARCHAR(8), c.DURATION, 108) AS DURATION FROM      dupes JOIN      dbo.PBXDATA c ON dupes.CALLER_PHONE = c.CALLER_PHONE                    OR dupes.DIALED_PHONE = c.DIALED_PHONE WHERE      (c.SALES_REP LIKE 'Doug%' OR       c.SALES_REP LIKE 'Nick%' OR       c.SALES_REP LIKE 'Bob%' OR       c.SALES_REP LIKE 'Joe%' OR       c.SALES_REP LIKE 'John%')     AND (c.CALL_TIME &gt;= DATEADD(DAY, 0, DATEDIFF(DAY, 0,   CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)))     AND (c.CALL_TIME &lt;  DATEADD(DAY, 1, DATEDIFF(DAY, 0,  CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)))     AND DURATION = (SELECT CAST(DATEADD(S, SUM(DATEDIFF(S, '00:00:00', DURATION)), '00:00:00') AS TIME)                      FROM dbo.PBXDATA)  ORDER BY      c.CALL_TIME; </code></pre>
