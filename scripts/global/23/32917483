<p>I am a quetions about SQL. For example i have a table like this </p>  <pre><code>Name    Surname Price   Adress john    smith   100     adress123 alex    martin  200     adress2 john    smith   300     adress123 </code></pre>  <p>And i want to group this records which name is same.And this records prices must be sum()<br> Generally i write query like this</p>  <pre><code>SELECT SUM(PRICE),NAME AS TOTAL_PRICE  FROM TABLE1 A GROUP BY A.NAME </code></pre>  <p>But when i want to select other columns i should be group by like this </p>  <pre><code>... group by A.NAME,A.SURNAME,A.ADRESS </code></pre>  <p>I want select this columns without group by. I want to ask what is the best way selecting other columsn without using group by condition? </p>  <p>I am waiting this result </p>  <pre><code>200 ALEX    MARTIN adress2 210 JOHN    SMITH  adress123 </code></pre>  <p>but i don't want to group by surname and adress column</p>
