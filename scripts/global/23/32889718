<p>Does anybody have an SQL script which queries the ReportServer 'Catalog' table and gets the reports structure correctly? (like if you go to <a href="http://localhost/reports" rel="nofollow">http://localhost/reports</a>).</p>  <p>I basically would like it like:</p>  <pre><code>\     Report 1     Report 2 \Sub Folder     Report 3     Report 4     \Subfolder 2          Report 5 \Sales     Report 6     \Subfolder 3          Report 7 </code></pre>  <p>But I can't figure out where to start!</p>
