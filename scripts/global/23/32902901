<p>For reasons i don't want to elaborate, it has been decided to rename our database roles. I know there is no simple way to rename a role (no idea why),  but i came up with this solution:</p>  <pre><code>create table #RoleAssignment (id int identity, RoleName varchar(256), UserName varchar(256)) insert into #RoleAssignment select roles.name as RoleName, users.name as UserName    from sys.sysusers as roles   join sys.database_role_members as members     on members.role_principal_id = roles.uid   join sys.sysusers as users     on users.uid = members.member_principal_id  where roles.issqlrole = 1    and roles.name like 'OldRolePrefix_%'  declare @id int = null declare @RoleName varchar(256) declare @NewRoleName varchar(256) declare @UserName varchar(256)  select top 1 @id = id, @RoleName = RoleName, @UserName = UserName,@NewRoleName = replace(RoleName,'OldRolePrefix_','NewRolePrefix_') from #RoleAssignment  while (@id is not null) begin     execute sp_executesql N'sp_droprolemember @InSPRoleName, @InSPUserName',N'@InSPRoleName varchar(256), @InSPUserName varchar(256)', @InSPRoleName = @RoleName, @InSPUserName = @UserName      execute sp_executesql N'sp_addrolemember @InSPRoleName, @InSPUserName',N'@InSPRoleName varchar(256), @InSPUserName varchar(256)', @InSPRoleName = @NewRoleName, @InSPUserName = @UserName      delete from #RoleAssignment where id = @id     set @id = null     select top 1 @id = id, @RoleName = RoleName, @UserName = UserName from     #RoleAssignment end </code></pre>  <p>After this ,the scripts are run that set up role permissions.</p>  <p>I tested this and overall it works. But even after readign and testing out I am not sure: Did i forgot about anything?</p>  <p>Thank you a lot for any ideas/insights</p>
