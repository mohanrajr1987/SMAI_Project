<p>This is probably something really trivial I'm missing, but I can't seem to figure out why it's not working:</p>  <p>Basically, this works:</p>  <pre><code>DECLARE @names TABLE (name NVARCHAR(100));  INSERT INTO @names VALUES ('John'); </code></pre>  <p>but this does not:</p>  <pre><code>DECLARE @names TABLE (name NVARCHAR(100));  INSERT INTO @names VALUES ('John'), ('Jane'); </code></pre>  <p>I'm getting this error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Msg 102, Level 15, State 1, Line 5<br>   Incorrect syntax near ','.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Why wouldn't this work? I've done this thousands of times with SSMS 2008.</p>
