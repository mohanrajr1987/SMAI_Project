<p>I created a layout for an <code>AlertDialog</code> in which there's a <code>TextView</code> that shows some text. For the text I have an item in <code>strings.xml</code> where I would like to change the color of a single word, just like in the image below. I tried with this:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;string name="dialog_text"&gt;Text... &lt;font fgcolor="#000000"&gt;TheWordIWantInBlack&lt;/font&gt; text text text.&lt;/string&gt; </code></pre>  <p>The issue is when I run this on the device (Galaxy Note3) that shows all the text in the dialog except for the word in the <code>&lt;font&gt;</code> tag but on the emulator (Nexus 5 with Android 6.0) everything is ok, exactly how I want it. Could you help me?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/XQKF5.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/XQKF5.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
