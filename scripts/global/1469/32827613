<p>I have five output txt files (Apple, Bean, Carrot, Tomato, and Orange) with one column and index as it shown below:</p>  <p><a href="http://s1081.photobucket.com/user/sally7844/media/1_zpsymx3mxp7.jpg.html?sort=3&amp;o=1" rel="nofollow">http://s1081.photobucket.com/user/sally7844/media/1_zpsymx3mxp7.jpg.html?sort=3&amp;o=1</a></p>  <p>And now I need to combine this single column output file into multiple files as one output file in txt form and have the following output file with the following index and column:</p>  <p><a href="http://s1081.photobucket.com/user/sally7844/media/2_zpsau7kwwol.jpg.html?sort=3&amp;o=0" rel="nofollow">http://s1081.photobucket.com/user/sally7844/media/2_zpsau7kwwol.jpg.html?sort=3&amp;o=0</a></p>  <p>How can I do that?</p>
