<p>Greetings. I have been using Serial PORT API to Transmit Data to Serial Port and the following code to read and write file to serial port.</p>  <pre><code>File file = new File(musicpath + "file.txt");     StringBuilder text = new StringBuilder();      try {         BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file));         String line="";         int c,counter=0;         while ((c = br.read()) != -1) {             String s = new StringBuilder().append("").append((char)c).toString();             MainActivity.sendDataChar(s);          }       }     catch (IOException e) {         //You'll need to add proper error handling here     } </code></pre>  <p>I have been transmitting 8 BIT MONO WAVE FILES  @ 22Khz from SD CARD using RS485 and I do have hardware to playback the transmitted data using DAC. (BOTH TRANSMITTER and RECEIVER uses ARM7 - LPC2148). </p>  <p>Now my idea is to have the 8 BIT WAVE FILE stored in SDCARD of Android Device and transmit the same at specified frequency using timer.</p>  <p>I wanted to know how to do this. I tried the above method but I do understand that the transmission frequency does not match as I needed. (PORT OPENED AT 230400 baud rate).</p>  <p>With the above code, a 155 KB File should take approximately 6-7 seconds to finish up the transmission character by character. But it really takes about 15-20 seconds and I dont have the audio output at the receiver end. Just the noise.</p>  <p>Kindly advise me and give some ideas on how to do it in realtime just like the way I managed to do it in ARM7.</p>  <p>Thanks a Lot</p>
