<p>I have a (multiline) text indicator in my program where I display everything that my program does. Every time after adding new string to the indicator, I move the vertical scroll bar to the end to make sure that the user will see the message instantaneously. It works fine. </p>  <p>However, when there is a lot of text in the indicator, the user is unable to move the scroll bar. Also, the scroll bar doesn't move to the bottom of the indicator after adding a new message. </p>  <p>How can I increase the capacity of my text indicator? Is it even possible or do I have to decrease the amount of text I display?</p>  <p>The rest of the program works well, the screen doesn't freeze. The only problem I have is that the vertical scroll bar doesn't work properly.</p>
