<p>I'm trying to play post audio on <a href="https://nerdspal.com/Questions/Details/87/How-to-create-a-directory-in-linux" rel="nofollow">this</a> page.</p>  <p>The problem is, when I click the play button. It just plays after some seconds. It's usually around 5-6 seconds. I'm afraid that the user will get blind and say what the heck is going on?</p>  <p>How do I calculate how much time it takes to convert text to speech in speech synthesis, I can show <strong>preparing to play</strong>.</p>
