<p>I am working on a note-taking application written in Java, and the UI is made using JSP, html, css. Currently, the user is only able to enter plain-text as the input. </p>  <p>So, whenever the user would change some text in the Note, we would compare the two texts using diff_match_patch as done below. Then, the differences will be highlighted and added in the Notes history. And I am marking the differences using diff_match_patch's preetyHtml() function. </p>  <p>Now, we would like to insert the Note text in HTML, so that user can have some advanced text in the front-end. But now when we compare the difference using diff_match_patch, we will see the actual text changed, like  was changed to . Diff_match_patch won't understand or care about HTML tags or data. </p>  <p>So, how can we compare the actual differences and mark them in some fashion, but also allow the user to have some editing mechanism with a simple-editor which can serve bullet-points, italic, bold, etc. </p>  <p>Code for comparison :</p>  <pre><code> if (!(mnotes.getMnotetext().equals(mnotes1.getMnotetext()))) {             if (isLineDifferent(mnotes1.getMnotetext(), mnotes.getMnotetext())) {                 diff_match_patch diffMatchPatch = new diff_match_patch();                 LinkedList&lt;diff_match_patch.Diff&gt; deltas = diffMatchPatch.diff_main(mnotes1.getMnotetext(), mnotes.getMnotetext());                 newText += diffMatchPatch.diff_prettyHtml(deltas);             }             groupNoteHistory.setNewNoteText(newText);             noEdit = true;             groupNoteHistory.setWhatHasChanged("textchange");             groupNoteHistory.setNewNoteText(newText);          } </code></pre>  <p>I hope my question is clear. If there is any doubt, please let me know. </p>
