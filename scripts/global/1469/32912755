<p>So I've recently encountered an issue with some of my users where they have a limitation on a number of characters they have in an input text box right now that is set to 800 chars and I've gotten complaints about people needing more space.   </p>  <p>Now note - I don't want to see these areas also get spammed with people who want to write memoirs and their life stories here either. </p>  <p>I'm thinking I either need to make it clear that whatever it is their writing in there needs be shortened out OR I need to create some sort of Facebook-chat-like area where they are limited to 800 chars but can enter multiple entries into the system? </p>  <p>But I'm not sure if doing that chart-like set up is really db costly or not? Or should I just up the text area to be twice as long? </p>
