<p>There is a focus on the field , in the browser , or notepad . When I plan to offer NFC, I want to force to insert text into the focused field . I know how to read NFC tag and add it to the clipboard . But how to make paste this text into an external application for the selected field ? Unfortunately I have not found how to do it using the clipboard manager. Tell me in what direction I move? Maybe using the keyboard ?</p>
