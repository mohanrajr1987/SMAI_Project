<p>My purpose is to read a text file (&lt;50 mb) and perform a regex on it and then save it back to another file (in c#). How i am doing that is posted below.</p>  <pre><code> Regex regex = new Regex(@"\s{2,}"); var lines = File.ReadLines(path);         foreach (var line in lines)         {             Console.WriteLine(regex.Split(line,2)[1]);             File.WriteAllText(regex.Split(line,2)[1]);                             } </code></pre>  <p>When i try this with a small file (140KB) it works fine. When i run the same with a file of size ~ 50 MB, it crashes Does it have anything to with performing a regex inside the loop?</p>  <p>IndexOutOfRange is the exception that is thrown. What i cannot understand is how a 45mb file can run my system out of memory? I have 8 gigs of RAM installed.</p>
