<p>I am comparing three academic fields in terms of what keywords are present in articles related to the fields. I need to do the below process with three different data sets, and then make a list of the top 50 keywords for each field where none of the same keywords are in the same list. I want to look at the differences in what the keywords are. </p>  <p>Example: the fields are partially overlapping so that the term 'Innovation' will be present in the list of top 50 keywords for all fields. I want to remove the words that appear several times, like 'Innovation' completely from all three lists. So that I will have a list of top 50 keywords for the three fields, and there will be 150 unique words.</p>  <pre><code>library(tm)  reviews &lt;- read.csv ("1_Keywords.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE) str(reviews) review_text &lt;- paste(reviews, collapse=" ") review_source &lt;- VectorSource(review_text) corpus &lt;- Corpus(review_source) corpus &lt;- tm_map(corpus, tolower)  corpus &lt;- tm_map(corpus, removePunctuation) corpus &lt;- tm_map(corpus, stripWhitespace) corpus &lt;- tm_map(corpus, removeWords, stopwords(kind = "en")) corpus &lt;- tm_map(corpus, stemDocument)  dtm &lt;- DocumentTermMatrix(corpus) dtm2 &lt;- as.matrix(dtm) frequency &lt;- colSums(dtm2) frequency &lt;- sort(frequency, decreasing=TRUE) frequency[sort.list(frequency, decreasing=TRUE)[1:50]] </code></pre>  <p>Ouput of head(reviews)</p>  <pre><code>PERFORMANCE.PAY..LEVEL.EVIDENCE..PRODUCTIVITY..HIERARCHIES..AUTHORITY..DECENTRALIZATION..COORDINATION..INEQUALITY..DELEGATION..KNOWLEDGE 1                                                                                                               NETWORK REVENUE MANAGEMENT 2                                              RANDOM YIELDS; SYSTEMS; DEMAND; MARKET; OPTIMIZATION; EQUILIBRIUM; COMMODITIES; FORMULATION 3                                                                               SPONSORED SEARCH; DESIGN; INFORMATION; EXCHANGES; INTERNET 4                                                                                                        GAMES; MECHANISM; SELLERS; DESIGN 5                         CORPORATE-INVESTMENT; SPIN-OFFS; DEBT; INTEGRATION; MANAGEMENT; INNOVATION; VALUATION; PROJECTS; MERGERS; CHOICE 6                                 WAGE DYNAMICS; CEO; COMPENSATION; PAY; PERFORMANCE; DIRECTORS; TURNOVER; INCENTIVES; CONTRACTS; MANAGERS </code></pre>
