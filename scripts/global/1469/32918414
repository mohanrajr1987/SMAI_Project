<p>so I'm making a game that uses nothing but the console in my java IDE, but I have a problem using delays. My goal is to create a method that when taken a text passed though the parameters, it prints it letter by letter with a delay of 50. (Kind of like the text in the Pokemon series, how it scrolls though each letter).</p>  <p>The problem I have is lag. I'm running an amd fx-8350 cpu (4GHz, 4 cores+4 virtual cores). Whenever I change the delay amount to anything around and under 100 milliseconds, the console prints half a word, then a little bit of the other half, then half the sentence, then maybe a character, etc.</p>  <p>I've tried this code here (it works, but with lag):</p>  <pre><code>public void scroll(String text){     int delay = 50;     ActionListener action = new ActionListener()     {         int counter = text.length();         @Override         public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent event)         {             if(counter == 0)             {                 timer.stop();             }             else             {                 System.out.print(text.substring(text.length() - counter, ((text.length() - counter) + 1)));                 counter--;             }         }     };     timer = new Timer(delay, action);     timer.start();  }//end scroll </code></pre>  <p>And this code as well (also works, with same amount of lag):</p>  <pre><code>public void scroll(String text){     for(int i = 0; i &lt;= text.length(); i++){        try {                Thread.sleep(1000);             }catch(InterruptedException ex){                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();             }        System.out.print(text.substring(i, i + 1));     } }//end scroll </code></pre>  <p>In conclusion, I'm guessing that the computer is doing more than "delaying" when I try to delay the thread. Any idea's?</p>  <p>-Thanks, Eric</p>
