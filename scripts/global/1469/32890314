<p>Sorry for my poor English.</p>  <p>I added </p>  <pre><code> android:configChanges="keyboardHidden|orientation|screenSize"   </code></pre>  <p>in XML manifest  </p>  <p>I restore RecyclerView's position by this code</p>  <pre><code>mRecycleViewParceble = mRecyclerView.getLayoutManager().onSaveInstanceState();      doRefreshAdapter();//Create and set adapter mRecyclerView.getLayoutManager().onRestoreInstanceState(mRecycleViewParceble); </code></pre>  <p>But after screen rotation and refreshing list text in list comes to be smaller. But I set 14sp in xml. And not change this size in runtime.</p>  <p>This happens on customer's Sony Xperia P (ICS). On my devices everything is fine. </p>  <p>What does they do.
