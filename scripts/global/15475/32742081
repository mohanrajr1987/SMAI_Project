<p><strong>Logic:</strong></p>  <p><strong>Client &lt;-----connection----->  Server Port Listening Script in Python ( e.g. TCP port 11112)</strong></p>  <ul> <li>Every Client Device (e.g. GPS device) connected to server port and establish successful connection.</li> <li>Once connected, we need to keep the connection active and stable for that particular device.</li> <li>In Parallel we need to accept connection from other devices in same port. </li> <li>We achieved this using Multi Threading concept in python. One thread will have a dedicated connection with one device. </li> <li>Once there is no data for certain time, Thread will be closed.</li> </ul>  <p>This logic is working fine as of now for 20 parallel connected devices.</p>  <p>We are expecting that we will be in connection with 1 million devices soon. <strong>What are the best solutions possible in python to handle this huge number of active connection between device and Server ?</strong></p>  <p><strong>Note</strong>: We can set up multiple ports and make sure load shared between ports but the active connection limit ( Alternate for Threading)  must be our focus.</p>
