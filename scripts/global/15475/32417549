<p>There is this <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#sharing-state-between-processes" rel="nofollow">documentation</a> for sharing state between processes, but it doesn't completely answer my question.  I have the following code</p>  <pre><code>from multiprocessing import Process, Value, Array  #This is my function def my_func(my_array):     my_array = ["hello", "hi", "howdy"]  # I am initiating an array called arr that has string elements here if __name__ == '__main__':     arr = Array('c')      p = Process(target=my_func, args=(arr))     p.start()     p.join()      print(arr[:]) </code></pre>  <p>I want arr to be equal to <code>["hello", "hi", "howdy"]</code> by the end, but my code does not work.  Does anyone know why?</p>
