<p>I use <code>multiprocessing.Queue</code> to deal with ad creation. But it seems some elements got lost when using Queue.get() (for example, I put 10 ads in the Queue, but only 8 were processed after multiprocessing work finished).</p>  <p>The code is:</p>  <pre><code>from multiProcessing import Process, Queue, JoinableQueue  def create_ad(origin_queue, ad_queue):     ''' ad creation'''     for ad in iter(origin_queue.get, None):         try:             # do sth else              ad_queue.put(ad)         except:             pass             # actually there exists logging here, no error outside         finally:             origin_queue.task_done()     origin_queue.task_done()  if __name__ == '__main__':       origin_queue = JoinableQueue()      # mock to put ads inside      ads = [1,2,3,4,5]               [ origin_queue.put(ad) for ad in ads ]       ad_queue = Queue()      process_list = []      for p in range(4): # PROCESS_NUM          process = Process(target=create_ad, args=(origin_queue, ad_queue))          process_list.append(process)      for process in process_list:          process.daemon = True          process.start()       origin_queue.join()       for process in process_list:          origin_queue.put(None)      origin_queue.join()       while not ad_queue.empty():          ad = ad_queue.get()   # number of ad got here is different from ads put inside it </code></pre>  <p>Is my Queue's usage wrong?</p>
