<p>I have a long-running python script that needs to be executed by an arbitrary number of users for many files. Multiprocessing and scalability are essential.Â </p>  <p>Based on a post regarding the multiprocessing module, it seems that a user reloading/resubmitting may be a problem as well as the server dropping tasks that run too long.</p>  <p>Is a desktop interface the only option for running this code?</p>
