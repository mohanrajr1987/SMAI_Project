<p>I have an input that holds the code for a coupon. Users can fill in a custom code, but I'd like to give them a default code. I have the following code now:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;input type="text" name="code" value="{{ form.code|default(RANDOM_CODE) }}"&gt; </code></pre>  <p>And I want to replace <code>RANDOM_CODE</code> by a random string.</p>  <p>I don't think that is relevant to the question, but <code>form.code</code> contains the original coupon code. I use the same form for editing.</p>  <p>According to Twig docs, it's possible to generate random numbers using <code>random()</code>, or even get a random char from within a string using <code>random('abcdefgh...')</code>, but I'd like to generate a random string with a specific length.</p>  <p>I know that I can do that using at least two approaches: 1. generating a default random code in the controller and then passing it to the view, or 2. creating a Twig extension with a function to generate the random string for me.</p>  <p>Knowing that, I'm curious if there is a way to generate a random string using only Twig's built-in functions.</p>
