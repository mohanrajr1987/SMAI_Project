<p>Is there a way to default to a blank string rather than the translation key in the event the translation has not been found in a Twig template?</p>  <p>I am attempting this sort of thing using the <code>default</code> Twig filter alongside the <code>trans</code> filter however this does not work:</p>  <pre><code>{{ 'crmpicco.general.course.opening_hours_weekend'|default('')|trans }} </code></pre>
