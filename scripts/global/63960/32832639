<p>I'm using Twig to render my simple site.</p>  <p>I have header and left column (list of site folders). Both header and column use dynamic data, i.e. I render it with some data.</p>  <p>In my right column I'd like to show content of folder specified by user in left column.</p>  <p>I have basic layout.php, structure.php (partial for left column) which extends layout.php, and content.php which extends structure.php. When no folder is specified I render structure.php, i.e. header and all site folders.</p>  <p>But I have faced with a problem. When I try to render content.php I must set data not only for content itself, but for layout.php and structure.php. </p>  <p>In fact I must duplicate data to render structure.php and content.php. I seems very strange to me. I feel there must be a nice solution, but I don't where it is.</p>  <p>Hope, someone could help me with it. Thank you.</p>
