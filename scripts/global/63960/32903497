<p>I want to add globally alt (the alternative text can be for example the name of the image) for all images on my web site. I know I can register my own Twig Extension (I want to do it) and then use it as a filter for images like that: |my_filter. But I want to write something that I could use for all images without editing single image tag.</p>  <p>How could I do something like that?</p>
