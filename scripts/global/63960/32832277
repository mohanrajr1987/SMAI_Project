<p>Considering that Twig has it's <code>{% for %}</code> loops and it's <code>{% image %}</code> sections, is there something such as the following be done with Twig to return all images within the <code>AppBundle/Resources/images/gallery/</code> directory? It would seem to make sense but I've not been able to find anything so far:</p>  <pre><code>{% image @AppBundle/Resources/images/gallery/*.jpg %}     &lt;img src="{{ asset_url }} /&gt; {% endimage %} </code></pre>
