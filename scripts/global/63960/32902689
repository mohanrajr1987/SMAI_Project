<p>Is there any way to use something like this?</p>  <p><code>$foo = "{{ object|filter }}";</code></p>  <p>Because I'm trying to write a dynamic image converter that needs to output something like the example, but when in my twig I use <code>{{ foo }}</code>, it just outputs a raw string <code>{{ object|filter }}</code> instead of executhing the filter on the object as intended. </p>  <p>I've tried to use <code>{{ foo | raw }}</code> but same result.</p>  <p>What I'm trying to do exactly</p>  <p><strong>CONTROLLER</strong></p>  <pre><code>$image = $em-&gt;getRepository('AcmeDemo:Media')-&gt;find($id); $image_src = sprintf("{{ %s | imagine_filter('%s') }}", $image-&gt;getWebPath(), 'front_small'); return $this-&gt;render('image.html.twig', array(     'image_src' =&gt; $image_src )); </code></pre>  <p><strong>TWIG</strong></p>  <pre><code>&lt;img src="{{ image_src }}"/&gt; </code></pre>  <p>So, I have a twig function inside a PHP variable <code>$image_src</code>, that Twig function could be, once formatted with <code>sprintf</code> <code>{{ '/uploads/foo.jpg' | imagine_filter('front_small') }}</code>.</p>  <p>That is a string for now, because it's inside a php variable <code>$image_src</code>, that variable is sent to my Twig template with the name <code>image_src</code> so, for now it is a string as I've said, if I do</p>  <p><code>My variable contains "{{ image_src }}"</code> It will output a <strong>string</strong> that says: </p>  <p><code>My variable contains "{{ '/uploads/foo.jpg' | imagine_filter('front_small') }}"</code></p>  <p>Because, as I've said, <code>image_src</code> is just a string, but I want to acutally execute inside my Twig, the string that contains <code>image_src</code>, because yes, it is a string (to the eyes of the compiler) but we all know it is or it is pretended to be a Twig function (because of the syntax).</p>  <p>So, why <code>| raw</code> <strong>will not</strong> work?, because it is inteded to be used with strings containing <code>HTML</code> code, if it were <code>HTML</code> syntax it would work, but it's a <code>Twig</code> syntax, so It doesn't work.</p>  <p>Resuming, there should be a <code>| compile</code> twig function that executes Twig code inside a variable like <code>| raw</code> does with HTML, but, as this function doesn't exists, I'm wondering if there's a way to achieve it...</p>  <p>As @joshua said, it's like a Javascript <code>eval</code>.</p>  <p>I hope I've explained good what is the problem and what I need.</p>
