<p>I need to overwrite the page template locations for Woocommerce using timber Wordpress.</p>  <p>All page Templates are stored in the theme root folder and i want to move the woocommerce files  (like <strong>single-product.php</strong>) to a custom subfolder.</p>  <p>The folder should be in the same theme (my-theme/custom/single-product.php)</p>  <p>I have read around on google but haven't been able to find a definitive answer. Thanks</p>
