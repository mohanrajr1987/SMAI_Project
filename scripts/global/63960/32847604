<p>I have two arrays from my controller that I pass to my twig template. This twig template then passes these values onto my javascript file but how they end up there is incorrect.</p>  <pre><code>//Controller  return $app['twig']-&gt;render({template_name}, array(     'cities' =&gt; $this-&gt;cities,    )); </code></pre>  <p>In my twig template I have the code snippet below:</p>  <pre><code>var cities = "{{ cities|json_encode(constant('JSON_PRETTY_PRINT')) }}"; </code></pre>  <p>I have followed the suggestion made by Sensio's Lab Documentation and this doesn't seem to work for me.</p>  <p>I end up with a json string as shown below:</p>  <pre><code>{&amp;quot;B01&amp;quot;:[&amp;quot;Gaborone&amp;quot;]...} </code></pre>  <p>Also JSON_PRETTY_PRINT is said to be not defined. If I remove this constant then the error is gone. The most important thing for me is to have the correct json format and I have tried all the suggestions I came through on the net.</p>  <p>Any suggestions on how I can get my json to be outputted correctly?</p>
