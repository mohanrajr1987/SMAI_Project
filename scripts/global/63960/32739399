<p>I'm having diffculties trying to find the right syntax for a multiple Twig filter expression.</p>  <p>I have a var called <strong>floatVar</strong> which is not always defined.</p>  <p>If it is defined, I would like to truncate this float to the third digit. If it is not defined, I would like to set an empty string. </p>  <p>I'm having trouble finding the proper syntax:</p>  <pre><code>floatVar|number_format(3, '.','')|default('') // generates a Twig_Error_Runtime exception  floatVar|default('')|number_format(3, '.','') // output "0" in every case  (floatVar|number_format(3, '.',''))|default('') // generates a Twig_Error_Runtime exception </code></pre>  <p>Could somebody point me in the right direction ? Is there a way to put paranthesis to explictly express the priority ? Any help or link to a related topic would be much appreciated.</p>  <p>Have a good day.</p>
