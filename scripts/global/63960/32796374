<p>I'm trying to install the new Admingenerator Bundle (symfony2admingenerator/generator-bundle). Some of the generated templates (like *List/results.html.twig) requires the Twig function "is_expr_granted" which should be in the jms/security-extra-bundle .. The issue is that the Twig extension (Twig/SecurityExtension) doesn't seem to be loaded. Has anyone experienced this? Any idea?</p>
