<p>I am using the SQL Editor in IBM Data Server Manager to execute queries against DB2. The query in question works fine. However, when I click "Explain" to generate the access plan I get </p>  <blockquote>   <p>"Access Plan Graph Cannot Be Generated"</p> </blockquote>  <p>and the diagnostic text is</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The SQL statement failed. Explanation: The SQL statement resulted in   an error with SQLCODE: -204 and SQLSTATE: 42704. User response: The   DB2 documentation contains more information about the SQLCODE and how   to resolve the error. "DB2ADMIN.TABLENAME" is an undefined name..   SQLCODE=-204, SQLSTATE=42704, DRIVER=3.66.46</p> </blockquote>  <p>The query is something like</p>  <pre><code>select col1, col2 from tablename where pred=value </code></pre>  <p>Why is it failing? What needs to be changed?</p>
