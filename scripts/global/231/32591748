<p>I'm trying to write a function to update existing rows in a table with ebean. I instantiate a new Ebean model object, give it the existing ID, add the properties I want to change, then send Ebean an update request. However, the update is not sent to the database. What could be the issue here?</p>  <pre><code>EB_Datasource ebds = new EB_Datasource(); ebds.id = 100; ebds.databaseName = "NewValue"; ebds.update(); System.out.println("test values: " + ebds.databaseName); ebds.refresh(); System.out.println("test values: " + ebds.databaseName); </code></pre>  <p>The results of the print statements are:</p>  <pre><code>test values: NewValue test values: OriginalValue </code></pre>  <p>What could be the issue here? Why isn't update doing its job?</p>
