<p>My organisation wants to setup DB2 for our .Net application that links/uses the database setup on a remote desktop with a fixed IP address. Now, I'm trying to setup this DB2 databse using DB2 Express-C and IBM Data Studio and it is unable to connect to the database through the Java connection. </p>  <p>How do I know this? I tried performing a normal SQL operation using a DB2 command window and it worked. </p>  <p>If I try to do the same thing with Data Studio or command line processor, it doesn't work: always throws a 'user ID revoked' error.</p>  <p>I tried reconfiguring environment variables to JDBC4 driver, using it from an administrator account, but nothing works. </p>  <p>Question - How do I make this work properly? is there any guide or tutorial anyone can share to setup db2 express c properly. </p>
