<p>I am using Squirrel 3.5.0 client to connect to DB2 Database. Recently I have changed my DB2 to run on SSL instead of normal TCS/IP. Now I want Squirrel to connect to my DB2 server using SSL port. So I updated the port number in the connection string. Now I need to add the server certificate into the Squirrel client truststore so that it can trust the server connection but I don't know how to do it? Does anyone have any idea over it?</p>
