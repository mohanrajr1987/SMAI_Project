<p>I have generated an XML data by using the function <strong>XML GENERATE</strong>, then I placed the same data in WebSphere MQ by using an COBOL - MQPUT Batch program.</p>  <p>From other COBOL - MQGET batch program, I retrieved the XML data from the MQ, and I tried to insert the same data in to the pureXML table, but I was facing an error code <strong>00002039Q</strong>.</p>  <p>Because the pureXML table supports only, UTF - 8 encoding format. But our generated XML data is in EBCDIC format.</p>  <p>Kindly help me how to convert an EBCDIC/UTF - 16 data to UTF - 8 data.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
