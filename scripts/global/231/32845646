<p>Need a help in converting decimal to <code>hh:mm:ss</code> format in <code>DB2</code>.</p>  <p>I have a query with some calculation which has an outcome like <code>0.59</code> or <code>1.11</code> or <code>2.14</code>. With the below query, I can change <code>1.11</code> to <code>00:01:11</code> but it does not work when its less than <code>1</code>. In case <code>0.59</code>. It does not convert.</p>  <pre><code>TIME(TO_DATE(Time,'mi.ss' ) ) </code></pre>  <p>Thanks. </p>
