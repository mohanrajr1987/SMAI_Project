<p>I am wondering if some one can throw ideas on how to build solution in this scenario.</p>  <ol> <li><p>I have to connect to DB2 and take a column oriented DB2 file(for example 6 fields in the file).</p></li> <li><p>I have Oracle table - I need to compare my DB2 file with Oracle table (6 fields - its in JSON format)and throw exception if  any rows do not match.</p></li> </ol>  <p>Is this do-able with Python? </p>  <p>If so, I would love to know how would you approach to this problem?</p>
