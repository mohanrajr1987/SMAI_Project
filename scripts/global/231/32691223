<p>I am new to DB2 and have no idea on about DB2 drivers also. I have to connect to DB2 database using iReport and generate reports.</p>  <p>I tried to connect to DB2 database from iReport. I got error like:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>COM.ibm.db2.jdbc.app.DB2Driver class not found.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I have added <code>db2jcc.jar</code> and <code>db2jcc_license_cu.jar</code> and <code>db2java.jar</code> files in iReport classpath (tools--->classpath). I have also added <code>db2java.jar</code> file in ireport services under (Window menu) it is loading this class <code>COM.ibm.db2.jdbc.app.DB2Driver</code>. But iReport was unable to load this class.</p>
