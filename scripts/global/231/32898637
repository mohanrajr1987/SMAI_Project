<p>My problem is very similar to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22793888/roll-forward-is-required-following-the-restore">this post</a>.</p>  <p>I have tried numerous combinations to no avail. On ServerA, I created a backup with this command:</p>  <pre><code>db2 backup db mydb user myuser using mypass online to c:\db-backup\local include logs without prompting </code></pre>  <p>I then copied that file to ServerB, and ran:</p>  <pre><code>db2 =&gt; restore database mydb user myuser using mypass from C:\ TAKEN AT 20151001060002 logtarget C:\DB2\NODE0000\LOGS replace existing without prompting </code></pre>  <p>I'm uncertain on how to properly handle the logtarget, and the result of that command was this warning:</p>  <pre><code>SQL2540W  Restore is successful, however a warning "2523" was encountere during Database Restore while processing in No Interrupt mode. </code></pre>  <p>I read up on the warning, and it seemed appropriate for what I was doing:</p>  <pre><code>SQL2523W  Warning! Restoring to an existing database that is different from the database on the backup image, but have matching names. (more) </code></pre>  <p>Then I ran this:</p>  <pre><code>db2 =&gt; rollforward database mydb user myuser using mypass to end of logs and stop </code></pre>  <p>And received this:</p>  <pre><code>SQL1268N  Roll-forward recovery stopped due to error "1" while retrieving log file "S0002796.LOG" for database "MYDB" on node "0". </code></pre>  <p>I've tried numerous combinations like this:</p>  <pre><code>db2 =&gt; restore database mydb user myuser using mypass from C:\ TAKEN AT 20151001060002 WITHOUT ROLLING FORWARD </code></pre>  <p>And got this:</p>  <pre><code>SQL2537N  Roll-forward is required following the Restore. </code></pre>  <p>I'm now stuck. Any help would be appreciated.</p>
