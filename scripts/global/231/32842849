<p>I have a problem with a job on the as400 consuming a lot of CPU over a long period.</p>  <p>I think it has something to do with a job that the system excecutes , the System index advisor to check or build indexes.</p>  <p>I have noticed that when we do data loads(From old DB to new DB) this process starts and takes long to end.</p>  <p>When I look in the joblog of the active job it gives the following:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/XkL0F.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/XkL0F.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Next page :</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/yy7VJ.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/yy7VJ.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I can see there's a problem :</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ynv42.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ynv42.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>And it has to do with an index on the table <code>p6oispf</code> but I dont know what index or how to fix this problem...</p>  <p>What is causing this and how can we stop this from happening?</p>  <p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
