<p>I'm trying to migrate data from DB2 to Postgres using pentaho ETL now. character code on DB2 is Shift-JIS (Japanese specific character code) and Postgres is UTF-8.</p>  <p>I could migrate data from DB2 Postgres successfully, but Japanese character has not been transformed properly (it has been changed to strange characters..)</p>  <p>How can I change character code from Shift-Jis to UTF-8 when I transfer data?</p>
