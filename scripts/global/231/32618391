<p>I've noted that using COALESCE (in my case) to avoid possible NULL value in prepared statement causes a decrease in performance of DB query time execution. Can someone explain me what is the root cause and how can I overcome that issue? Queries samples below:</p>  <p><strong>QUERY 1 (execution time 3 s):</strong></p>  <pre><code>SELECT TABLE_A.Y, TABLE_B.X FROM ... WHERE Z = ? AND TABLE_A.ABC = ? AND      TABLE_A.QWERTY = ? AND TABLE_A.Q = TABLE_B.Q; </code></pre>  <p><strong>QUERY 2 (execution time 210 s):</strong></p>  <pre><code>SELECT TABLE_A.Y, TABLE_B.X FROM ... WHERE Z = ? AND (   (COALESCE(?,'')='') OR    (TABLE_A.ABC = ? AND TABLE_A.QWERTY = ? AND TABLE_A.Q = TABLE_B.Q) ); </code></pre>  <p>The only difference is using (COALESCE(?,'')='').</p>
