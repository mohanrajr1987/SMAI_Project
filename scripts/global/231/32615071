<p>I'm working in a project where I need to make changes in the database to create a history of managers and status of projects and use it, instead of the already existing columns of managers and status in a projects table. The problem is: there are several aplications that may or may not be using those fields in this old table and would be almost impossible find all the aplications that use those fields to make them use the new tables. </p>  <p>So, I had been thinking, there is any way to create a stored procedure in a db2 database that can make the values in the manager and status columns in the projects table come from a query to the new history tables?</p>  <p>Sorry for my bad english.</p>
