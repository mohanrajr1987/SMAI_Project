<p>(The intro is similar to my previous question, this is not a duplicate)</p>  <p>I'm developing a security product for databases in java. One feature in this product is creating security recommendations based on db-privileges and activity.</p>  <p>In order to do that I need to extract privilege data from db2. Privileges extracted from DB2's catalog tables have the GTYPE column which determine if the grantee is a user or a group. </p>  <p>In the latter case I also need to know which users are members in that group. But group membership is not defined in DB2, but is based on an external entity (OS usually). </p>  <p>In my case I don't have direct access to the OS of the DB i want to monitor, So the question is: Is there any way to deduce the group-user relationship from db2's catalog tables (or anywhere else)</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
