<p>The usual form of a WITH statement is</p>  <pre><code>WITH myrecs(field1, field2, field3) AS(Select field1,field2,field3 from afile) select * from myrecs </code></pre>  <p>Is it possible to replace the select with a call to a stored procedure? For example</p>  <pre><code>WITH myrecs(field1, field2, field3) as (CALL myproc) select * from myrecs </code></pre>  <p>In this case, myproc would execute the select from the first example.</p>  <p>Regards Ron Ventura</p>
