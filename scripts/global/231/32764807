<p>I'm currently using bash on CentOS. DB2 is installed and <code>db2</code> is on my path.</p>  <p>I have a few lines in a script which are supposed to update my db2 database, but they aren't working. As a minimal reproduction, I can do the exact same thing right in the bash command line and get the same error. Here's that reproduction:</p>  <pre><code>$ db2 connect to PLT02345 user uni using uni; db2 update USM_USER set STATUS = 1 where NAME = 'asm_admin' </code></pre>  <p>I expect this to set <code>STATUS</code> to <code>1</code> for everything in <code>PLT02345.USM_USER</code> where the <code>NAME</code> is currently <code>asm_admin</code>.</p>  <p>Instead, I get an error about <code>"ASM_ADMIN"</code> not being valid in the context where it's used. Here's the full output:</p>  <pre><code>  Database Connection Information  Database server        = DB2/LINUXX8664 10.1.2 SQL authorization ID   = UNI Local database alias   = PLT02345  DB21034E  The command was processed as an SQL statement because it was not a valid Command Line Processor command.  During SQL processing it returned: SQL0206N  "ASM_ADMIN" is not valid in the context where it is used. SQLSTATE=42703 </code></pre>  <p>I'm confused - what about this makes it not valid? Is bash somehow mutilating the command and not passing everything as it should to db2?</p>
