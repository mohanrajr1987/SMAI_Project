<p>I am running a DB2/SQL - FULL JOIN query.</p>  <pre><code>    PROC SQL;     CONNECT TO db2 AS db1 (USER=&amp;dpwuscod. PASSWORD=&amp;dpwpwcod.  DATABASE=&amp;dpwdbnam.);      CREATE TABLE result3 AS      SELECT *      FROM   CONNECTION to db2       (                SELECT     count(* ) as NbrCount               FROM        a               FULL JOIN   b                ON         a.pk = b.pk               AND      a.snap_dt='2015-08-31'                AND        a.sys_num not in ('1234')        );     DISCONNECT FROM db2;     QUIT; </code></pre>  <p>Table A has 586,648 rows. Table B has 2,384,874 rows.</p>  <p>I was expecting the number of rows in the FULL Join to be between 2,384,874 (when there is a complete overlap of the PK) to 2,971,522 (when the two tables have Mutually Exclusive PK / 2,971,522 = 586,648 + 2,384,874)</p>  <p>However, in actuality, the above join is yielding NbrCount = 24,898,361. </p>  <p>Any pointers on why the number of rows has blown up?</p>
