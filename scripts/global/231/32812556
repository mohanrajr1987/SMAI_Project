<p>everybody</p>  <p>I am working on an application which is using IBM db2 as database and using passport js for authentication purpose.</p>  <p>so my question is how do i compare the values which are coming from login form to that which are stored in database.</p>  <pre><code>passport.use(new LocalStrategy({       usernameField: 'euser',       passwordField: 'epass' }, function(username, password, done){       process.nextTick(function() {          /* how do i open connection to db2 and compare username and password           with the data stored in database? */       });   } )); </code></pre>  <p>how do i open connection to db2 and compare values in order to authenticate user and start session.</p>
