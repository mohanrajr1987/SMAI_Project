<p>Select statement works fine:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT ID, WHEN, TEXT FROM TABLE WHERE WHEN BETWEEN '2015-01-01' AND '2015-01-2' </code></pre>  <p>ID INT, WHEN TIMESTAMP, TEXT VARCHAR(1024)</p>  <p>Export works fine too, but all TEXT are empty strings</p>  <pre><code>db2 "export to file.csv of del SELECT ID, WHEN, TEXT FROM TABLE WHERE WHEN BETWEEN '2015-01-01' AND '2015-01-2'" --- 11111, "2015-01-01-11.46.04.000000",""  22222, "2015-01-01-11.46.07.000000","" </code></pre>  <p>DB2 is not my kind of candies. I've tried to specify codepage, no luck. Why it doesn't work?</p>
