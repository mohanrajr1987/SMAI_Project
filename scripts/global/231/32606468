<p>I am trying to connect to a db2 database from my domino application without using the extension library.</p>  <p>I have created a managed bean that it only connects to the db2 and prints a message on the console.</p>  <p>I call the method of the managed bean from a button on an xpage.</p>  <p>The code in the bean is this:</p>  <pre><code>Class.forName("com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2Driver"); String url = "jdbc:db2://10.0.1.49:50000/AVIN"; String user = "db2admin"; String password = "ibmdb2"; con = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password); System.out.println("Successful TEST JDBC Connection!!"); </code></pre>  <p>I have also configured my build path and added the db2jcc.jar library.</p>  <p>The problem is that i am getting </p>  <blockquote>   <p>java.lang.ClassNotFoundException for com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2Driver</p> </blockquote>  <p>Why is this happening?</p>
