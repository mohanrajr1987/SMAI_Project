<p>I have a app that work with asp mvc 4 and DB2 DB, and sql instruction developing with odbc.</p>  <p>The problem is that I can't perform a insert, update and delete data. ( I do not know how to do it).</p>  <p>I use the following pattern in select statement.</p>  <pre><code>string query = "select login, name from user where login = dxfg"     OdbcConnection cn = new OdbcConnection("credentials :)"); cn.Open(); OdbcCommand cmd = new OdbcCommand (query,cn); OdbcDataReader oa = cmd.ExecuteReader(); </code></pre>  <p>But I donÂ´t know how to perform other instructions, for example what return in a update, insert or delete. (for later send to the controller method)</p>  <p>We appreciate your help or link reference.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
