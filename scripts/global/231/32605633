<p>I want to move a DB2 10.1 database schema including tables, view, keys, sequences and its data to a new database on another network.</p>  <p>The new database is in a Production environment and because of security protocols, I cannot copy it directly across the networks.  The current database is in a non-Production test environment.</p>  <p>I'm looking to generate script or scripts which will recreate the database schema including the tables, view, keys, sequences and its data.  These scripts can then be transferred to the other network and run from there.  </p>  <p>How can I do this?  I have looked at db2move and db2look, but this looks like I will have problems when inserting the data because of referential constraints and the sequencing of primary keys (want to keep the current key id as it is being used as a reference number by the business team, but it is auto generated in the database).</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
