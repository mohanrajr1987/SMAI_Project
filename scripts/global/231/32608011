<p>I'm developing a security product for databases in java. One feature in this product is creating security recommendations based on db-privileges and activity.</p>  <p>In order to do that I need to extract privilege data from db2. So far I'v read a lot of documentation on db2 security but I haven't found a solution yet for the following problem:</p>  <p>The <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/data/library/techarticle/dm-0601wasserman/" rel="nofollow">Db2 udb security, part 4</a> article explains how to extract privileges only but <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/data/library/techarticle/dm-0601wasserman/#N106D0" rel="nofollow">here</a> it says: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Instance level authority levels (SYSADM, SYSCTRL, SYSMAINT, and SYSMON) and group membership are defined outside of DB2 UDB, and are therefore not reflected in system catalog tables.</p> </blockquote>  <p>To my understanding authorities have effect on a user's privileges and therefore are crucial to get the full picture of entitlements of the db.</p>  <p>Further in this article it explains how to get the authorities of the connected user but doesn't explain how to get all authorities of all users\groups. similarly to this answer: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10395416/how-to-check-db2-sysadm-or-sysctrl-authorization-for-a-user">How to check DB2 SYSADM or SYSCTRL authorization for a user</a></p>  <p>So my question is how to extract authorities of all entities in a single query? </p>
