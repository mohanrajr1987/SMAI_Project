<p>I need to pass output of query to my Datastage Job, which will process it further. Problem is that I used type conversion and calculation in my SQL query, and DataStage needs to know the exact datatype of the input columns.</p>  <p>Simpler way is to guess the column type, for Ex: CAST it to INT  But sometimes its INT64 and then I have to change it, so I'm looking for something reliable which will save me time.</p>  <p>More like Metadata of Resultset.</p>
