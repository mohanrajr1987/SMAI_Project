<p>I have a value coming in that will ultimately be an html <code>id=</code> attribute. I don't have control over what set the value, so it is possible that it is not safe. I know to check for single quotes and double quotes, but ow do I check to make sure that it clean?</p>  <pre><code>                                variables.result &amp;= '&lt;div class="alert alert-danger"'; if(attributes.id        != "")  variables.result &amp;= ' id="#attributes.id#"'; </code></pre>
