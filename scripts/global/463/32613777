<p>I have a weird problem and its got me stumped. If I send an email like this (below) it sends fine. The content of the email is html and sending using the first method shows the html content as text as expected.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;cfmail to="xxxx.xxxx@xxxx.com" from="xxxx.xxxx@xxxx.com" subject="To Oxint"&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I change nothing in the email except change the cfmail line to this (below)</p>  <pre><code>&lt;cfmail to="xxxx.xxxx@oxint.com" from="xxxx.xxxx@xxxx.com" subject="To Oxint" type="html"&gt; </code></pre>  <p>The email is not received. Not in my junk or spam folder. Just not received. CF mail logs show my email as successfully sent.</p>  <p>I've got our network team looking for issues as well, but its baffling. Any suggestions would be very much appreciated.</p>
