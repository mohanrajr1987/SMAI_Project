<p>I'm using the cffileupload tag on my page, and it's working marvelously, however, for some reason, its presence changes the styles of other elements on the site, primarily font and text size.</p>  <p>I tried playing around with the cffileupload style attribute, but it didn't fix this problem. How can I use this tag whilst maintaining the correct style of the page.</p>  <p>Here is the code I'm currently using:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;cffileupload url="uploadTest.cfm/?uploadPath=#dirPath#"               progressbar="true"               name="myupload"               extensionfilter="*.mp4, *.jpg, *.png, *.flv, *.txt"               MAXFILESELECT="10"               MAXUPLOADSIZE="200" /&gt; </code></pre>
