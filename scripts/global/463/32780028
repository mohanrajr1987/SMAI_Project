<p>I have a process that creates a list of possible duplicate companies.  The problem is that "The ABC Company, Inc." and "ABC Company, Inc." both in Dallas, TX are probably duplicates but I won't find them with my criteria. I've eliminated the first 4 characters if they are "the " but I also need to check for the right 5 characters if they are " Inc.".</p>  <p>I have a view that creates a column thename.  The prefix "the " has been stripped;</p>  <pre><code>    SELECT     CASE WHEN LEFT(name, 4) = 'The ' THEN RIGHT(name, (len(name) - 4)) ELSE name END AS thename, CASE WHEN CHARINDEX(' ', ltrim(rtrim(Name)))                            = 0 THEN ltrim(Name) WHEN CHARINDEX(' ', ltrim(Name)) = 1 THEN ltrim('b') ELSE SUBSTRING(ltrim(Name) + ' x', 1, CHARINDEX(' ', ltrim(Name))) END AS subname,                            CHARINDEX(' ', LTRIM(Name)) AS wordcheck, Name, Address_Line_1, City AS Company_City, State AS Company_State, Zip, Area_Code, Phone, Status_Flag, ID,                            Not_Dupe_Flag, DUNS, Temp_Check_Dupes_Flag, Parent_Company_Number, Special_Display,                            CASE WHEN c.parent_company_number = 0 THEN c.id ELSE c.parent_company_number END AS parent     FROM         dbo.Companies AS c </code></pre>  <p>Then I use that view in my query to look for duplicates;</p>  <pre><code>        &lt;cfquery name="qResults" datasource="#request.dsnlive#" timeout="200"&gt;             SELECT b.ID,             Thename,             substring(TheName,1,(CHARINDEX(' ',TheNAME,1))) as subName,             name,             b.address_line_1,             b.zip,             b.company_state,             b.company_city,             b.area_code,             b.phone,             b.Special_Display,             isnull(not_dupe_flag,'False') as not_dupe_flag,             isnull(Temp_Check_Dupes_Flag,'False') as Temp_Check_Dupes_Flag,             b.id as bID,             b.duns             FROM dbo.vw_Comp_Details_withFirstWord as b             WHERE isnull(b.status_flag,'') != 'D'             and b.ID &lt;&gt; #arguments.CompNum#                 and isnull(b.Temp_Check_Dupes_Flag,'False') = 'False'             &lt;cfif arguments.IncludeDunsOnly eq 0&gt;                 &lt;cfif arguments.FirstWord&gt;                     AND b.subName = '#arguments.CompanySubName#'                 &lt;cfelse&gt;                     AND (substring(dbo.KeepAlphaNumCharacters(Thename),1,#val(arguments.WordLength)#) = substring('#arguments.CompanyName#',1,#val(arguments.WordLength)#)                     or differnce(soundex(Thename),soundex('#arguments.CompanyName#')) &gt; 2)                 &lt;/cfif&gt;                 AND (                 ( company_city = '#arguments.City#'                  AND Isnull(company_city, '') &gt; '' )                  AND ( b.parent != #val(arguments.Parent)#                      AND Isnull(b.parent, '0') &gt; 0 )                      )                 &lt;cfif arguments.IncludeDuns&gt;                 AND (                 ( REPLACE(LTRIM(REPLACE(b.duns, '0', ' ')), ' ', '0') = '#val(arguments.Duns)#'                  AND REPLACE(LTRIM(REPLACE(b.duns, '0', ' ')), ' ', '0') &gt; ' '                  AND #val(arguments.Duns)# &gt; 0 )                     or  REPLACE(LTRIM(REPLACE(b.duns, '0', ' ')), ' ', '0') = ' '                     )                 &lt;/cfif&gt;              &lt;cfelse&gt;                 and (REPLACE(LTRIM(REPLACE(b.duns, '0', ' ')), ' ', '0') = '#val(arguments.Duns)#')             &lt;/cfif&gt;           &lt;/cfquery&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Now I need to add code to strip the suffix " Inc." but I can't seem to come up with the logic to end up with a column that contains the name without the prefix "The " and the suffix " Inc."</p>
