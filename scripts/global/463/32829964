<p>I am implementing credit card processing on my site and I am using a HTML form and processing the cards. I have only tested this for now. if some one view the source they can view the action page. </p>  <p>is there a way i can avoid this. is there a way to expire the page when user clicks the browser back button, so that he has to reload the page if he wants the view the previous page. </p>  <p>please explain the best practice. I am using coldfusion to make this form. </p>
