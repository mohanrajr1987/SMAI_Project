<p>I am from a PHP background and am very new to ColdFusion. I am using ColdFusion-10</p>  <p>I have created two files: a cfm file and a cfc file. When I am executing a query using cfquery in cfm file it is working. But when I am executing same in a cfc file, and calling the function in the cfm file, its throwing an error, saying the table name does not exist.</p>  <p>cfquery in both the files:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;cfquery name="test" dbtype="query"&gt;     SELECT * FROM tbl_name &lt;/cfquery&gt; </code></pre>
