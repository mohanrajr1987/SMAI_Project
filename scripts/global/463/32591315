<p>I want do deploy a webapplication (coldfusion) on a windows machine using gitlab and webhooks, so to be able to push changes to the server automatically, but it seems that existing solutions are 99% dedicated to linux deploy.</p>  <p>I've already set up manual deployment with git:<br>     1. clone repository on target machine<br>     2. each time, connect and pull changes but of course is not automatic at all.  </p>  <p>I strictly need a process I can set-up on a windows server.</p>  <p>I've found some reference about using openssh for the task, but I'd prefer a simpler mechanism.</p>  <p>I've also checked the Kudu project <a href="https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu</a> but it seems to be a work in progress and not easilly usable product.</p>  <p>Is there anything existing I can use for the task?</p>  <p>Thanks for any help you can give me.</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>  <p>Just to be more specific, I need something to automatically deploy changes pulled from a GIT repository, not to merge files, or sync folders.</p>  <p>Ideally, I need something able to respond to gitlab webhooks and trigger a pull from the git repository.</p>
