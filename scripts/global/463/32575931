<p>I would like to give a user the option to display data in an HTML table or a DataTAble.  I have a select dropdown that I am populating with a query output.  After the user selects an option from the list they would select one of two radio buttons: (1) view HTML table, or (2) view DataTable.  The user selects one of these radio buttons and then clicks on the submit button to display the results on a new page.   The new page receives the form.value and inserts this into the query to produce the HTML table or DataTable.  </p>  <p>I'm new to ColdFusion.  It seems easier assign an action page to each radio button selection.  I have made some attempt but nothing working yet.  I'm guessing this may be a trivial task, but any help would be appreciated.</p>  <p>So on the form you would have your select dropdown and input</p>  <pre><code>&lt;select name="Species" class="dropdown"&gt; &lt;cfoutput query="species"&gt; &lt;option value="#species.Species#"&gt;#species.GenusSpecies#&lt;/option&gt; &lt;/cfoutput&gt; &lt;/select&gt;      &lt;input type="radio" name="Species" value="DataTable"&gt; DataTable &lt;input type="radio" name="Species" value="HTML" checked="checked"&gt; HTML Table &lt;input type="submit" value="Submit" class="buttons"&gt;&lt;/input&gt; </code></pre>  <p>How do I assign something to a radio button and then execute with submit?  cfparam or cflocation??</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
