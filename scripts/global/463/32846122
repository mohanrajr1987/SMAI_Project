<p>I'm creating a multi-step form with pagination that will show a <code>Next</code> and <code>Previous</code> button depending on which step you are on. In order to display the buttons correctly, I need to store the total number of steps in a variable somewhere. </p>  <p>Do I store this in the Request scope e.g. <code>REQUEST.TotalSteps = 5</code> or Application scope e.g. <code>APPLICATION.TotalSteps = 5</code>? The number of steps will rarely change so I'm thinking that Application scope is better suited, but I want to minimize the use of RAM because I have a lot of stuff stored in the SESSION scope for each other.</p>  <p>What would be the ideal option?</p>
