<p>Apologies for the poorly-phrased questions - wasn't quite sure how best to phrase it!</p>  <p>I'll start with my query as it currently stands;</p>  <pre><code>&lt;cfquery name="getmessages"&gt;     SELECT p.*, u.bgid, u.displayname, u.companyName, (SELECT COUNT(projectid)               FROM projectmessages WHERE projectid='#pid#') AS msgcount     FROM projectmessages p     LEFT JOIN users u ON p.msgCreator=u.bgid     WHERE p.projectid='#pid#'     ORDER BY msgID DESC     LIMIT 10 &lt;/cfquery&gt; </code></pre>  <p>That simply outputs messages relating to a specific project.  However, the author of each message may have also uploaded any number of file attachments - which are recorded in a separate table called 'projectfiles' - a unique ID (msgUUID) links both the file record and the message record.</p>  <p>What I'd like to do here is twofold - firstly amend the above query to also return the list of files (fileid, filename) attached to each message if any, and also include these in my cfoutput.</p>  <p>I could of course simply add a cfquery within my cfoutput of 'getmessages', but that seems inefficient, so I've convinced myself there must be something more effective.</p>  <p>I'm aware that I can do a left join to look for 'a file', but I'm stumped at how it would handle instances of multiple files (though that is perhaps more of a case of how I handle it at the cfoutput point?).</p>
