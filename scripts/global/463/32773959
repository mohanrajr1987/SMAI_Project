<p>I am working on a mobile site and have had luck building sites in Muse.  However, I have a mobile web site that will be dynamic which will use ColdFusion.  I would like to find out if anyone has used Muse to build a site and then inserted code such as ColdFusion or any other language such as PHP or ASP.net and if you can provide best practices for completing a project in this manner.</p>
