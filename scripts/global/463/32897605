<p>I want to create some JSON from a coldfusion variable which is an array of structs.  My array has five records in it (or at least more than one).  So I have this:  </p>  <pre><code>&lt;cfset sIA = serializeJSON(myArray)&gt; &lt;cfdump var="#sia#"&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I thought I would see as many rows as I have in my array, but I only see the last element in the array: </p>  <pre><code>[{"MY_CODE":"RR","MY_DESC":"TRAX","ABC":"N"}]  </code></pre>  <p>I want to create this JSON so I can do some ajax stuff that will work with the data in the array.  How do I fix it?  </p>  <p>Linda</p>
