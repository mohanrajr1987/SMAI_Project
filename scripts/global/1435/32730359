<p>Within a <code>prepareForSegue()</code> function, I declared a constant as a ViewController type. When I access this constant, a value type with the character "L" appears next to it. I understand "M" stands for Method, "C" for class, and "V" stands variable, but what does this "L" stand for? </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ziJjm.png"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ziJjm.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Aside: Not sure what "T" stands for either.</p>
