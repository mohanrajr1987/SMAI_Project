<p>My iOS app has a function that would access the camera, so every time users access that function, the app would popup a message (see attached image), I think this is nice. </p>  <p>But recently I found that this prompt would popup once users launch the app, I don't like this, how can I change it back? Thanks!</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/0mA0b.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/0mA0b.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
