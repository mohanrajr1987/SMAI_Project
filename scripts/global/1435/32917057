<p>I have a list of entries, which can be thought of as paragraphs from a book, stored as separate objects of the same class. These objects have a ‘num’ property, along with the actual text, so that I know their order and can later display them in as a list in the correct order (1,2,3, …).</p>  <p>Now I want to bring this one step further and be able to ‘record’ the structure of the book, like the table of contents. In other words, say the book is divided into chapters, and each chapter is further divided into sections. The first few paragraphs are found under Ch.1 Sec.1, then Ch.1 Sec. 2, and so on all the way to Ch. n, S. m. What I’m not sure of is what’s a good way to record this information? I've been told that I should use a database with SQL but I'm not sure where to begin.</p>  <p>The implementation must allow me to ‘quickly’ determine the following two things at any point: (1) Given a chapter and section #, what paragraphs are contained within this section? (2) Given a paragraph #, which chapter and section is it under? It must also be flexible enough that I could use the same platform in the future with few edits if the structure (depth-wise) of the book changes (e.g. sections are divided into subsections, etc.). Finally, should be able to handle optional divisions (i.e. some sections have subsections while others do not).</p>  <p>This is for an iOS app and my code is written in Objective-C so far.</p>
