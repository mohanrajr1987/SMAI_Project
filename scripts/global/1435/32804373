<p>In my cell subclass the user can slide the cell for actions, just like in Mail.app. However, the cells can be much larger than Mail.app, sometimes up to 1,000pt which means it requires the table to be scrolled to read fully. </p>  <p>This means that the normal strategy of simply centering the actions vertically in the cell will not work, as the vertical center could very well not be visible. So I want to display it in the vertical center of the <em>visible area</em>. </p>  <p>Is this possible to do within the <code>UITableViewCell</code> subclass where the sliding action is occurring? Figuring out where the vertical center of the visible area even is?</p>
