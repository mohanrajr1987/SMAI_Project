<p>A lot of the answers I've seen to this question are either in Objective-C, hacky solutions, or solutions that don't answer the entire question.</p>  <p>I've been able to change the non-selected values colors using:</p>  <pre><code>datePicker.setValue(UIColor.whiteColor(), forKeyPath: "textColor") </code></pre>  <p>Is there a way to change the selected date's color and font from a UIDatePicker without being hacky? </p>
