<p>I have a main View controller that is a UITableView that holds posts, so if a user clicks on a post, you would be able to see the post in more detail and comment on it. I just had that if the user pressed the cell, it would be redirected to the new view controller so that you could see the post in detail, and it automatically added the back button function on the navBar. After iOS9 update, I cannot go back. I'm not writing any code for that, I'm just using the push method, which worked fine on iOS8, but not on iOS9. Is there a way to fix this?</p>
