<p>I get nervous when I dive too deep into certificates, identifiers, and profiles in iOS. I have an expired distribution push provisioning profile. It expired and I use parse as my push notifications server. I think what I need to do is </p>  <p>-Go to Apple Dev Center -Create a new provisioning profile with same app id -Create a new cert signing request and p12? -Upload p12 to parse? -Use new provisioning profile and submit app to app store</p>  <p>(I need to update the app anyway)</p>  <p>Is this how I should go about it? If not, what are the general steps. Thank you!</p>
