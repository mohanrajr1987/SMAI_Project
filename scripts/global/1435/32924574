<p>I've created a simple project to try out SceneKit, added a scene which contains a man character and a camera.</p>  <p>The problem is the code behaves differently on the simulator and on the device.</p>  <p>When loading the man character into a SCNNode object, in the simulator this "man" node has child nodes, which themselves contain geometry.</p>  <p>However when running on device, the man node contains no child nodes and itself have the geometry.</p>  <p>Why is that so? Can someone explain what exactly I messed up?</p>  <p>I've uploaded the sample project to GitHub so you could check it out and run it on your simulator and device.</p>  <p><a href="https://github.com/iamBlueGene/SceneKitExperiment" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/iamBlueGene/SceneKitExperiment</a></p>  <p>Thanks, Eli.</p>
