<p>My app tracks location while in background... the location background mode is enabled and i use </p>  <pre><code>[self.locationManager startUpdatingLocation]; </code></pre>  <p>This works great on <code>iOS7-8</code> but it stopped working on <code>iOS9</code></p>  <p>In simulator it works, but on real device i get no callback while in background... when running the same code on iOS8 device i get normal callbacks as before</p>  <p><strong>Is this documented? Why does it work in simulator and not in device? is it a bug?</strong></p>  <p>When using <code>startSignificantChangeUpdates</code> it works on iOS9, i wonder if this is some kind of battery saving feature, that they possibly prohibited startUpdatingLocation</p>
