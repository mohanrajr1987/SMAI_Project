<p>I'm trying to select and set an instance variable that is part of another UIViewController, however, I don't know how to select another ViewController and access its contents without using a segue.</p>  <p>Whenever a user checks off a task, a percentage of tasks that are complete should be calculated and another view controller's instance variable should be set. </p>  <p>I realize I'm currently instantiating a new view controller instead of selecting the one I already have on the storyboard. I'm using a third party sidebar menu that resides behind my main view, although it really exists as a separate Scene/ViewController. It should be noted that this sidebar menu  doesn't use a segue reveal itself. Is there any method to select another view controller and access it's instance variables? </p>  <pre><code>@IBAction func checkOffTask(sender: UIButton) {      // Select sidebar view controller     let sidebarViewController = self.storyboard?.instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier("sideBarScene") as! SideBarViewController      // Calculate percentage of completed tasks         // Select the count of all tasks         let allTasksCount = Float(firstDataSource.count + secondDataSource.count)          // Select the count of all completed tasks         let completedTasksCount = Float(secondDataSource.count)          // Divide the two to get a percentage         var completedTaskPercentage = completedTasksCount / allTasksCount          sidebarViewController.completedTaskPercentageTemporary = String(stringInterpolationSegment: completedTaskPercentage)      println(sidebarViewController)     println(sidebarViewController.completedTaskPercentageTemporary) } </code></pre>
