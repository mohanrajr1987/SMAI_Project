<p>I'm fascinated by this app called Instant (<a href="http://instantapp.today/" rel="nofollow">website</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id991690667?mt=8" rel="nofollow">app store page</a>) because it gathers device data that I thought was private:</p>  <ul> <li>The day's <strong>device usage time</strong>, in minutes</li> <li>The <strong>number of phone unlocks</strong> that day</li> </ul>  <p>According to a post by one of the developers, they used a combination of APIs to find the data. I couldn't find further information on how they did this.</p>  <p>How do you access this information?</p>
