<p>I am wondering what is considered the most <strong>secure</strong> way of two apps <strong>exchanging data</strong> within <strong>Cocoa Touch env</strong>.</p>  <p>I am very much <strong>new</strong> in iOS development and swift development and I am just looking to explore another part of the OS capabilities.</p>  <p>I read about App Groups sharing a location (directory) where files can be exchanged but also about URL schemas between apps to share data.</p>  <p>Are there any other ways of inter-app data exchange? And which is considered the most <strong>secure</strong> one?</p>  <p>Thank you...</p>
