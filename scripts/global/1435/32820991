<p>I am using autolayout to create a UI. I am setting some constraints there.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/4wO4y.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/4wO4y.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>In the above image, as you can see there, is a image view in the center. Now I want to set the size of the image view not proportional on iPad. I want to set its size slightly bigger than the iPhone 5, and in the center of the view. I want to use priorities here. How can I achieve that?</p>
