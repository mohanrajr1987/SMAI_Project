<p>So i am trying to implement location search just like in iOS Calendar app, where user can add an event and a location to it. I have a UITableviewController with SearchBar. My location finding code is this:</p>  <pre><code>    func searchForLocation(location:String){      let request = MKLocalSearchRequest()      request.naturalLanguageQuery = location      let localSearch = MKLocalSearch(request: request)       localSearch.startWithCompletionHandler({ r, e in          if e == nil {              let something:MKLocalSearchResponse = r!             let items:[MKMapItem] = something.mapItems              for mapItem:MKMapItem in items {                 let item:MKMapItem = mapItem                 print(item.placemark.title)             }          }else{             let err:NSError = e!             print(err.localizedDescription)         }      }) } </code></pre>  <p>Now i get some locations but results differ greatly from calendar app search results. Am i doing something wrong with search or there is something i don't know about <code>MKLocalSearchRequest()</code></p>  <p>Thank your for your time.</p>
