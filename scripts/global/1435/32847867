<p>I apply very typical approach to use the camera from app</p>  <pre><code>@IBAction func takePicture(sender: UIButton) {   var myPickerController = UIImagePickerController() myPickerController.delegate = self myPickerController.sourceType = UIImagePickerControllerSourceType.Camera  self.presentViewController(myPickerController, animated: true, completion: nil) } func imagePickerController(picker: UIImagePickerController, didFinishPickingImage image: UIImage!, editingInfo: [NSObject : AnyObject]!) {     self.images = image      self.dismissViewControllerAnimated(true, completion: nil) } </code></pre>  <p>However, anytime I use it the following prompt appears in terminal:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>[PLLogging] Couldn't create log directory: The operation couldnâ€™t be completed. (Cocoa error 513.)</p> </blockquote>  <p>I've already checked <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3439408/nsfilemanager-creating-folder-cocoa-error-513">this</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30184106/couldnt-create-log-directory">that</a> threads and many others but still can't figure out what should be changed. </p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
