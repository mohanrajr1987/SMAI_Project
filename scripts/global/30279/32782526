<p>We currently use software from another vendor that is not quite up to par legal wise.  This deals with phone numbers being called during hours that are not allowed by law.  What we want to do is prevent a person from making these calls.  The software vendor is behind the times and there is no option to prevent this currently.</p>  <p>Right now I have things covered when a person picks up a handset and dials a phone number manually, it will go through a workflow process that will check the phone number in the database to see if the call can go through or be blocked.</p>  <p>That system is separate from the other and cannot be utilized.  Which leaves 2 places where we are vulnerable in the application.</p>  <p>The application is built in C# version unknown, using .net 3.5. Location 1 I need to control is a button within the application that is loaded as a .dll  into a form.  When an account is looked up I need a check done against the database as a can call or cannot call.  If it is a cannot then I would need the button greyed out.  Otherwise then can press that button and make the call.  I tried blocking elsewhere and have been told it is not possible.</p>  <p>There is a second area as well but will have to take this step by step.</p>  <p>Any advice on this?  Possible?  Legal?  Unethical?  Please let me know, this has us vulnerable to legal issues.</p>  <p>Thank you</p>
