<p>I have an issue very similar to <a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/vstudio/en-US/97905526-f6c3-4426-89b3-240bd71e4b62/datagridview-refresh-causes-not-responding-application-but-only-when-not-in-visual-studio?forum=csharpgeneral" rel="nofollow">DataGridView refresh causes "Not Responding" application (but only when not in Visual Studio)</a></p>  <p>While loading my data to my Winforms app form, I temporary disable a panel filling the form and containing all the controls, and I enable it back when done.</p>  <p>As in the example, I work with <code>BackgroundWorker</code> to load data and use thread-safe <code>bgWorkerSend_ProgressChanged</code> or <code>bgWorkerSend_RunWorkerCompleted</code> to interact with the UI.</p>  <p>I also have a Windows Forms timer that refreshes in the same way the form after 5 minutes of idle time.</p>  <p>What is weird, is that at the end of the init load, the panel is enabled back correctly, while in the latter refresh, the application enters "Not Responding" mode, and remains there forever. Furthermore, this only happens when I execute directly the application. If executed from Visual Studio, it works correctly both at initial load and at refresh.</p>  <pre><code>private void _bw_ProgressChanged(object sender, ProgressChangedEventArgs e) {     if (e.ProgressPercentage == 100)     {         // re-enable panel         panel1.Enabled = true;          // the below is never reached !!?         AnyInstruction();     } } </code></pre>
