<p>I was used to .INI files for a long time. But C# is not natively made to use .ini files, so i would like to move on to XML now. I did read a lot of documentations, so i know there are many way to use XML too. Most of what i read is too much complicated for what i need. So i am a bit lost. So here comes the question: How can i use XML simply to create a simple formated file as were .ini files, and what method please?</p>  <p>example : </p>  <p>INI</p>  <pre><code>[config] name=the name size=the size [other] thing=some text whatever etc... </code></pre>  <p>XML (so something like)</p>  <pre><code>&lt;config&gt; &lt;name&gt;the name&lt;/name&gt; &lt;size&gt;the size&lt;/size&gt; &lt;/config&gt; &lt;other&gt; &lt;thing&gt;some text whatever&lt;/thing&gt; &lt;/other&gt; etc... </code></pre>  <p>As you see its a trivial use i need, and i don't want to use app.config because i will have several XML files and not only one.</p>  <p>How to create the xml file? And how to read values?</p>  <p>I would like to make two simples functions as:</p>  <pre><code>private void setConfig(string root, string name, string data) { } //&lt;root&gt; //&lt;name&gt; data &lt;/name&gt; //&lt;/root&gt; //checking if it exists to update the value and not have duplicate "name"  private string getConfig(string root, string name) { return data } </code></pre>  <p>There will only be around 20 items (lines) and no big datas in the file, by the way, so i guess no need for heavy methods ;) (After lots of research on docs and blogs, it looks like the method fitting my needs is Xdocument/Xelement tho)</p>
