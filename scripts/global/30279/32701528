<p>I'm populating an ASP.NET checkbox from a <code>SqlDataSource</code> added on the <code>.aspx</code> page, and then I need to access it in code behind, but I'm running into an issue in which my method is happening before the checkbox is populated and so it is giving me an item count of zero. </p>  <p>How do I make sure the checkbox is populated by the <code>SqlDataSource</code> before I access it with code? </p>
