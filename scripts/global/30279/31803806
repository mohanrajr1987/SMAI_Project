<p>A "completely empty" WPF application project targetting framework 3.5 takes more than 30 seconds to start on Windows 7 embedded SP1.</p>  <p>The problem doesn't appear on Windows 7 Enterprise SP1 neither on Windows XP.</p>  <p>The only thing in the WPF project is a declaration/initialization of a ConcurrentQueue coming from System.Threading.dll:</p>  <pre><code>private static readonly ConcurrentQueue&lt;String&gt; _queue = new ConcurrentQueue&lt;string&gt;();  </code></pre>  <p>I had to use this dll because the ConcurrentQueue doesn't exist in the 3.5 framework.</p>  <p>This seems like a system issue, could this be a problem between the two ConcurrentQueue? The one in my dll and the one in the framework 4.0 installed on the Windows 7 embedded computer?</p>  <p><strong>Some relevant information</strong></p>  <p>The System.Threading dll's version is 1.0.2856.102</p>  <p><strong>Edit</strong></p>  <p>As suggested by @Sinatr I created another ConcurrentQueue (copy paste of ConcurrentQueue, SystemCollectionsConcurrent_ProducerConsumerCollectionDebugView and IProducerConsumerCollection with ILSpy).</p>  <p>This solves the problem but I would like to know why.</p>
