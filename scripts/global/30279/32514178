<p>Can multiple (19 in fact) background workers all use the same DoWork event? Is there an issue with this?</p>  <pre><code>var bw1 = new BackgroundWorker(); bw1.DoWork += DoingStuff_DoWork; var bw2 = new BackgroundWorker(); bw2.DoWork += DoingStuff_DoWork; var bw2 = new BackgroundWorker(); bw3.DoWork += DoingStuff_DoWork; </code></pre>  <p>My next question is, if I call RunWorkerAsync on each background worker, will they all start at the same time?</p>  <pre><code>bw1.RunWorkerAsync(); bw2.RunWorkerAsync(); bw3.RunWorkerAsync(); </code></pre>  <p>I'm having some issues with a machine vision application which is driving me nuts.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
