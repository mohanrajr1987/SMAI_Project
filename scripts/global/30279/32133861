<p>I have created VB.NET application using <a href="http://www.opclabs.com/products/quickopc" rel="nofollow"><strong>OPC Labs QuickOPC Classic 5.12</strong></a> to get the data form the PLC server(<a href="http://www.softwaretoolbox.com/topserver/" rel="nofollow"><strong>SoftwareToolBox's Top server</strong></a> in remote machine). I have configured the <code>DCOM setup</code> in the client machine and server machine. The application is working without any errors, but for past 10 days the applications throws the following error frequently. </p>  <blockquote>   <p>A Security Package Specific Error Occurred.</p> </blockquote>  <p>The error is raised by the <code>COM/DCOM infrastructure</code>.</p>  <p>What are the possible reasons/ situations to get this error? </p>
