<p>I have a .NET 3.5 disassembled code, and I'm attempting to cause a NullReferenceException, to try and mimic a behavior I see in some dumps.</p>  <p>For example, I can see the following command:</p>  <pre><code>mov         byte ptr [rdi],0  </code></pre>  <p>I assume that by setting <code>rdi&lt;-0</code>, I could cause dereference to address 0x0.</p>  <p>However, I'm unable to edit any register value.</p>  <p>In MSDN, they claim 'Registers' window have the power to edit registers:</p>  <p><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/9dfstwbe.aspx" rel="nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/9dfstwbe.aspx</a></p>  <p>But this doesn't work to me in Visual Studio 2012.</p>  <p>Any help or other workaround?</p>
