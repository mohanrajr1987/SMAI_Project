<p>I am trying CRUD operations in .net 3.5 using entity framework. Am unable to delete the object. This is how my method in repository is,</p>  <pre><code>public void Delete(T bookInfo) {  context.AttachTo(EntityName, bookInfo);  context.DeleteObject(bookInfo); } </code></pre>  <p>I have followed <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1217052/entity-framework-delete-object-problem">this link</a> but I was still ended with the same error. Is there anything wrong in the code? Please suggest.</p>  <p>The error in the first line of the code says, 'An entity object cannot be referenced by multiple instances of IEntityChangeTracker.'</p>  <p>Before this line of code I used this line of code 'context.DeleteObject(bookInfo);' but, this gave me an error 'The object cannot be deleted because it was not found in the ObjectStateManager.'</p>
