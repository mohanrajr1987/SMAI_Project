<p>I am trying to redirect users to https and found some articles on how to do this; however, I need to make some additional modifications and needs some help. What I currently have in web.config is:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;rule name="Redirect to HTTPS" stopProcessing="true"&gt;       &lt;match url="(.*)" /&gt;       &lt;conditions&gt;           &lt;add input="{HTTP_HOST}" pattern="^OFF$" /&gt;       &lt;/conditions&gt;       &lt;action type="Redirect" url="https:&lt;server_alias&gt;/&lt;site_name&gt;" redirectType="Permanent" /&gt;   &lt;/rule&gt;   </code></pre>  <p>The requirement is to redirect all the following to https//&lt;server_alias>/&lt;site_name>:</p>  <p><a href="http://&lt;server_name_orIP_orAlias" rel="nofollow">http://&lt;server_name_orIP_orAlias</a>> and <a href="http://&lt;server_name_orIP_orAlias" rel="nofollow">http://&lt;server_name_orIP_orAlias</a>>/&lt;site_name>;</p>  <p>The above URL rewrite works (I added the rewrite rule at the server level in IIS). However, if user starts with https instead of http (i.e. bypasses the rewrite rule), I get the usual Windows IIS page (iisstart.htm) and can't figure out how to fix it. I tried adding a "default.htm", that just has a javascript redirection, to wwwroot folder to redirect it to http so it could use the rule and go to https but this gives me "403-forbidden" error.</p>
