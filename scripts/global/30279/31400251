<p>I know there are a lot of questions (and answers) out there to this specific problem but I'm not finding anything helpful nor anything that says that this is not possible.</p>  <p><strong>Scenario</strong>: I am working on a WebService that has also a Web-Frontend (but not only). For compatibility I had to use WSS UsernameToken authentication (Username, Password, Nonce, Created-timestamp). To accomplish this I have created a custom UserNamePasswordDigestValidator and de-serialize the header with the username and password. <em>The Service is hosted by a Windows Service NOT IIS</em> </p>  <p><strong>What I want to achieve</strong>: To increase security, I would like to add a delay between wrong loggins (this is a common way to deal with brute-force attacks, right?)</p>  <p><strong>Question 1</strong>: How is this usually done? How do you achieve something like this? It's strange that I can't find any guidance isn't this a security risk?</p>  <p><strong>Question 2</strong>: Assuming that it's a good way to improve the security, how can you achieve this? The main issue that I'm facing is, that I can not get any information about the requester (e.g. IP) to block this certain requester since OperationContext is null while validating the Token (according to this <a href="http://forums.asp.net/t/1660946.aspx?Access%20the%20user%20s%20ipAddress%20in%20a%20custom%20password%20validator" rel="nofollow">thread</a>, this is not possible)</p>
