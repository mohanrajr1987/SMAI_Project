<p>I finished an method that export and excel and another method that make a zip file and download it too. All works good, but i have a teoric questions. When i was making that methods, i decided use a same download method:</p>  <pre><code>private void generarArchivoSucave(byte[] archivoBytes, string fileNameWithExt) {         Response.Clear();         Response.ContentType = "application/force-download";         Response.AddHeader("content-disposition", "attachment;filename=" + fileNameWithExt);         Response.BinaryWrite(archivoBytes);         Response.End(); } </code></pre>  <p>My questions is, I need to change the response.ContentType to specific type of file and what will be the implications of just use "application/force-download" content type for all the cases, is better use an specific content type for each file or not. There are differences between browsers?. thank you.</p>
