<p>My .NET 3.5 applications are not using the Euro for Lithuania, but instead still show the former LT symbol when formatting currency. When running the following code:</p>  <pre><code>Dim ci As New CultureInfo("lt-LT", False) Dim amount As Decimal = 123.56 Label1.Text = amount.ToString("c", ci) </code></pre>  <p>I get the following result: 123,56 Lt</p>  <p>I should be getting: 123,56 €</p>  <p>I have several computers that behave in this way. All have KB3006137 installed, which is supposed to change the Lt to €. What's odd is that the Regional Formatting dialog in Windows shows €, so I know that KB3006137 has taken effect. However, .NET applications do not seem to pick up on this change and continue to use the former Lt.</p>  <p>I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling KB3006137, but the results are the same. Even on Windows 10, some computers show € and others show Lt. Any ideas on what's happening here? Is .NET possibly caching Lt instead of retrieving €?</p>
