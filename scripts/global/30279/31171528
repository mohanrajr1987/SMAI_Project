<p>I'm having some trouble setting up a .config based service trace for an application of ours.  The application .config doesn't configure the service.  It is configured and hosted by a dynamically referenced assembly.  The wording on that is weird, but I'm not exactly sure how to describe it, so here's what it looks like:</p>  <p>Our application, <code>Shell</code>, runs on a remote server and is exactly that.  It's a mostly-empty application that does one thing, it calls out to a service, <code>AssemblyService</code>, and streams over a helper assembly and executes it to setup the rest of the application.  At this point it configures and self hosts a local data service, <code>DataService</code>, which the remote server uses to occasionally let us handle certain procedures.</p>  <p>When I try to set up tracing on <code>Shell</code> all I get are the calls out to <code>AssemblyService</code>, but I want to see the calls to <code>DataService</code> as well.  I could probably set up tracing manually, but this is not the ideal circumstance.  Is there something I can put in the config to include <code>DataService</code> in the trace output?  This is what I'm trying to use in the <code>Shell</code> app.config</p>  <pre><code>  &lt;system.diagnostics&gt;     &lt;sources&gt;       &lt;source name="System.ServiceModel"               switchValue="Information, ActivityTracing"               propagateActivity="true"&gt;         &lt;listeners&gt;           &lt;add name="traceListener"               type="System.Diagnostics.XmlWriterTraceListener"               initializeData="c:\log\trace.svclog" /&gt;         &lt;/listeners&gt;       &lt;/source&gt;     &lt;/sources&gt;   &lt;/system.diagnostics&gt; </code></pre>
