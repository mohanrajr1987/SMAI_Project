<p>In my project I have the line</p>  <pre><code>DateTime alarmDateTime = DateTime.Parse(AlarmTimeStamp.Text); </code></pre>  <p>AlarmTimeStamp.Text is for example <code>"04/09/2015 10:23"</code> (The computer's Region setting is English UK)</p>  <p>This throws a FormatException, but only when the Optimise Code compiler setting is on, i.e. a Release build. If I turn this off, it works as expected.</p>  <p>I'm not sure where to begin with debugging this since the debugger doesn't work correctly with optimised code.</p>  <p>If it's relevant, this is from a ASP.Net Web Forms application, .Net 3.5 hosted in Windows Server 2008 R2, IIS 7.5.</p>  <p>Edit:<br> I have done some testing and found that this only occurs on one of my servers. I have 2 servers configured, a development and test. This issue only occurring on my development server. There is no difference between them though. They are both built from the same image.</p>
