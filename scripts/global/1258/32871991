<p>i have a really big issue in unity3D. When stray far away from (0, 0, 0) there are son floating-point precision. Ok, it's normal but i need a way to fix it.</p>  <p>Rust have a ViewModel System to render the models correctly. Recently i decompiled the Legacy Rust for looking how it works. It's really complex. I tried to understand exactly how it works but i understand only a part, that's really ambigus. If someone know how to fix it, please help with this.</p>  <p>I uploaded the Rust Source Code if someone want to take a look and try to understand how it woks really.</p>  <p>I have made an injector for checking ViewModel System. Basically, in the scene are a GameObject Called "__View Model Root" It contains all of the models for the ViewModel System. The System will render it but i don't have any ideas how.</p>  <p>Here are the Rust Source Code; <a href="https://mega.nz/#!Co90mTAB!uB2F2Y4uKzUrlcoOPxVgndAz_7SZh7bzvlhg374P7jg" rel="nofollow">https://mega.nz/#!Co90mTAB!uB2F2Y4uKzUrlcoOPxVgndAz_7SZh7bzvlhg374P7jg</a></p>  <p>The important classes are: CameraFX, ICameraFX, ViewModel, MountedCamera, MountCamera, ViewModelAttachment, ViewModelTester, VMAttachmentSocketOverride, ItemRepresentation, IHeldItem, etc...</p>  <p>Here are some screens.</p>  <p>The 2 links of the images are here: <a href="http://pastebin.com/BEgz2vf6" rel="nofollow">http://pastebin.com/BEgz2vf6</a></p>
