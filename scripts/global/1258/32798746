<p>My problem is that when the camera is moving to chase the player the background dosent change its position. It looks like the background would be a part of the HUD.</p>  <p>I have the player and the background in the same scene and I am using a bound camera. My code for the camera to chase the player:</p>  <pre><code>camera.setChaseEntity(player); camera.setBounds(0, 0,2355,2785); camera.setBoundsEnabled(true); </code></pre>  <p>The code for adding the background to the scene:</p>  <pre><code>SpriteBackground sp=new SpriteBackground(new Sprite(12,3,2355,2355,ResourcesManager.getInstance().background,vbom)); scene.setBackground( sp); </code></pre>  <p>The chasing works with every other Entity. Bounds etc are working also Does anyone have a solution for this?</p>
