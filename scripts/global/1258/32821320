<p>I have a requirement for android project where i have to give an option for user to record a video or take still picture using either Built-In camera or an external usb camera, the user needs to swipe left or right to switch between built-in camera and USB camera. I am done with the built-in camera part and got struck with external camera part.</p>  <p>Can someone guide me on how to toggle between built-in camera and external usb camera so that user can swipe left or right to switch between external and built-in camera's</p>  <p>I see suggestions on Stackoverflow to use OpenCV but since i have already built my app using the native android camera code to have the built-in camera part working, i was looking for way to have the external camera part to work without redoing everything using openCV.</p>  <p>Thanks Varun</p>
