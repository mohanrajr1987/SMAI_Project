<p>In my app I am opening the native gallery app and making the user enable to select the image he/she want . every things is going well and working good as expected. </p>  <p>I was taking images from gallery on user click and showing them image in the Imageview after some rotation and scaling (if it is in landscape mode). But due to some reasons I have to change the way I was working. I would must say the procedure I was doing, is now deprecated by Boss. :P </p>  <p>well now I have come up with two ideas </p>  <ol> <li><p>To show only potrait images when user has clicked the gallery button in the app. </p></li> <li><p>Second way is when user click on landscape picture he should get error message that you can not select Landscape images. </p></li> </ol>  <p>I have searched the way and found two links such as <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17361808/open-image-from-gallery-only-in-potrait-mode">this</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9023559/android-imageview-showing-image-from-gallery-in-landscape">this</a> link.  but both links are taking images from the gallery and then rotating it and then setting the images in the imageview . </p>  <p>whereas I just want this work on real run time I mean either to show images only in Portrait mode or showing him error message as when he clicked the landscape image. I do not want to bring image and then check it and then I show him message I want him to show message while remaining in gallery app. </p>  <p>Please tell me How can I achieve this and what other good possible ways yo can think off. </p>
