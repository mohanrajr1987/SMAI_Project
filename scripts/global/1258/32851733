<p>I have an existing OSX app (Xcode 7, swift) that collects real time data (both textual and photos) from various local and internet (Json) sources to present in a user window.</p>  <p>I want to present the same data stream as an output stream that will appear as if it were just an OSX add-on camera (so that it can be selected as a camera source in other OSX programs).</p>  <p>Having trouble finding any framework documentation or examples for an app to act as a camera. Any help greatly appreciated.</p>
