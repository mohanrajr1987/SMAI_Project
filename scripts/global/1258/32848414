<p>What is the best way to create an accurate <strong>Auto Focus and Exposure</strong> for <strong>AVFoundation</strong> custom layer camera?, for example, currently my camera preview layer is square, I would like the camera focus and exposure to be specify to that frame bound. I need this in Swift 2 if possible, if not please write your answer I would be able to convert it myself.</p>  <p><strong>Current Auto Focus and Exposure:</strong> But as you can see this will evaluate the entire view when focusing. </p>  <pre><code>override func touchesBegan(touches: Set&lt;UITouch&gt;, withEvent event: UIEvent?) {     //Get Touch Point     let Point = touches.first!.locationInView(self.capture)     //Assign Auto Focus and Auto Exposour     if let device = currentCameraInput {         do {             try! device.lockForConfiguration()             if device.focusPointOfInterestSupported{                 //Add Focus on Point                 device.focusPointOfInterest = Point                 device.focusMode = AVCaptureFocusMode.AutoFocus             }              if device.exposurePointOfInterestSupported{                 //Add Exposure on Point                 device.exposurePointOfInterest = Point                 device.exposureMode = AVCaptureExposureMode.AutoExpose             }             device.unlockForConfiguration()         }     } } </code></pre>  <p><strong>Camera Layer:</strong> Anything in the 1:1 ratio should be considered as focus and exposure point, and anything outside this bound would not even be considered as a touch event for camera focus.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/F5ZWO.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/F5ZWO.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
