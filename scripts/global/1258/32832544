<p>I recently made an Android camera application meant for Sony Xperia phones. The API documentation mentions writing "xperia-camera-addons" in the description of the Play Store, which I did. The camera app has been downloaded three times now, so far so good. However, I would like to have a larger audience know about my app, which I thought was done by simply submitting the app to the Play Store and writing that specific comment in the description of the app. My understanding was that this is all that's required for my app to show up in the "downloadable" section of Xperia phones' camera, where a few other developers' apps do show up. I contacted Sony Developer World and I was told to pose this as a question on Stack Overflow, so here you go. If not in the camera app, I was hoping to find the app at least somewhere in Sony's "What's New" app, but nowhere can my app be found unless specifically searching for the name in the Play Store.</p>  <p>If anyone could help me out with this, I will be very thankful!</p>  <p><em>Being new on Stack Overflow I'm not sure if I should be posting links, so in case it's relevant to know: my app is called "Monochrome" and should be easily found in the Play Store (it has an icon closely resembling Sony's own camera icons).</em></p>
