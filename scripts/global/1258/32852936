<p>In the reference guide of the Sony Camera Remote API SDK (Sony_CameraRemoteAPIbeta_API-Reference_v2.10.pdf) the methods "deleteContent" and "getContentList" are documented. But using the Sony Camera Remote API SDK with a Sony QX1 the methods "deleteContent" and "getContentList" are not listed in the results of "getAvailableApiList" (neither in "Remote Shooting" nor "Contents Transfer" mode). </p>  <p>I assume that they are therefore not available?</p>  <p>How can the photos on the SDcard be deleted or formatted? </p>  <p>Running "getAvailableApiList" does list "actFormatStorage" in "Remote Shooting"-Mode. How can this be applied?</p>
