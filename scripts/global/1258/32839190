<p>I'm using the barcode-reader project in two Samsung devices (SM-N9005 or SM-G920F) and they are not capable of recognize any barcode. There are no problems in others like One plus one, or others Samsung devices like S3 or S4. </p>  <p>There is not a problem of the autofocus, because it is working fine, the barcode is focus properly.</p>  <p>With this devices, the camera opens but nothing happens.</p>  <p>HELP please.</p>
