<p>There are quite a few users of the Sony A7 line of cameras for astrophotography. It has been a source of frustration for many (all?) of us that Sony has not published any means of automating these cameras directly via USB. Capture One for Sony Pro starts in this direction. However, it is sorely lacking in the intervalometer area. For example, there is no clear way to trigger 25 exposures of 300 seconds back-to-back. It also only has limited control of the camera.</p>  <p>The Sony RCC app also leaves a lot to be desired. While there is a (confusing) way to schedule multiple image captures via a rudimentary intervalometer, there is no way to establish the length of the exposure outside of what the camera can natively perform on its own. In my case, my A7S will only take up to a 30 second exposure on its own.</p>  <p>What is needed from Sony seems to be clear documentation as to how the use the USB command set for software in general. For Astrophotography, software such as Sequence Generator Pro, The Sky X Pro, Maxim DL, and many, many others <em>require</em> this interface to the camera to work. In the forums for many of these software developers, it is easy to find people asking for support of the A7*, only to be turned away because "Sony doesn't appear to be interested in helping out" with the necessary SDK. </p>  <p>Canon and Nikon cameras do all of this very well! See BackyardEOS as an example. Search BackyardEOS on google.</p>  <p>Any developer would be able to solve this by developing an ASCOM driver that presents the camera to most astronomical software for control. Again, no USB SDK means this is not possible.</p>  <p>No Sony camera to my knowleged, including the flagship A7* series, is capable of any of this SIMPLY because Sony has continued to withhold the SDK.</p>  <p>Frustrating fact - it <em>is</em> possible to hold bulb mode on the A7* line by pressing the software capture button in the RCC software and holding it by mouseclick. One software developer ingeniously worked around the limitations of the Sony cameras by finding a way to artificially "hold" that button down, thereby allowing longer exposures. Still, this is just a hack.</p>  <p>As evidence of the desire for these capabilities, I submit the following as a very small slice of the conversations behing held. I do not believe that Sony is listening it its customers.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.cloudynights.com/topic/503749-sony-a7s-viable-for-eaa/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cloudynights.com/topic/503749-sony-a7s-viable-for-eaa/</a></p>  <p><a href="http://www.cloudynights.com/topic/488461-is-sony-really-alpha/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cloudynights.com/topic/488461-is-sony-really-alpha/</a></p>  <p>There are many more conversations like these - just check google. The base of all is such; the A7S and its ilk are wonderful astrophotography cameras, but Sony's unwillingness to provide support for USB tethering is essentially killing the idea. The wifi SDK is sorely limited, and forces the user to disconnect from their primary wifi network to operate. It also does not support bulb exposures of varying lengths.</p>  <p>What we need is, at a minimum:</p>  <ul> <li>Full featured USB tethering capability, including Live View</li> <li>Webcam-like capabilities - the camera should be able to be seen as a webcam by a PC/Mac, etc</li> <li>Full control of the camera, all exposure settings </li> <li>Full ability to execute intervalometer functions, with exposure length controlled at the PC</li> <li>On-the-fly image download to PC</li> <li>Video capture should also be able to be viewed this way, even if at a lower resolution</li> <li>Full lens control - focus, aperture, focal length given the lens support for it</li> </ul>  <p>Others, please add below as you see fit.</p>  <p>Sony - we're telling you what we want. Please take the time to listen and do something for your customers.</p>  <ul> <li>Greg</li> </ul>
