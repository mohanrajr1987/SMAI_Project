<p>When trying to use this to take a picture, it works perfectly fine on a laptop. But when I try it on mobile (by opening the webapp on a mobile device, not the native app) the camera screen is just a black screen. I can even snap the picture and it saves a large black snapshot. Why would this work on a laptop perfectly fine and not on a mobile browser? It even asks me for camera permission, which I allow. Yet it still gives me a black screen. </p>  <pre><code>Meteor.startup(function () {   MeteorCamera.getPicture({width: 320}, function(error, data) {     if (error)       alert(error.reason);     else       Session.set(IMAGE_KEY, data); </code></pre>
