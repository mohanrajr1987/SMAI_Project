<p>Forgive me if I am asking similar question but I am not getting the right answer or may be I am unable to understand how to implement it  I have to load HUD in front of camera I got camera DOF (x,y,z,apha, beta, gamma) I have only this information. How can I use camera DOF to translate the HUD in front of camera.</p>  <pre><code>      float x =  eye[ 0 ].X()+ 0.465;       float y =  eye[ 0 ].Y()+ 1.0; //bringing in front of camera      float z =  eye[ 0 ].Z()- 0.08;  </code></pre>  <p>I am adding few magic numbers to x,z (above mentioned lines ) and then  HUD is right on the screen but if the camera is moved the hud is disappeared because these magic numbers are for only that camera position. I want to know the solution </p>  <p>one of my friend told me following </p>  <p>Feed the camera rotation into the HUD_DOF_All so the HUD rotates to face the camera square on.</p>  <p>Then in SetInstancePosition use the eyePos + eyeDir * M I dont know how to achieve that or if it is true. Thanks in advance </p>
