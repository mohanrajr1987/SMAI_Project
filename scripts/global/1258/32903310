<p>I have a school assessment on average speed checks for cars. So when the car passes one speed camera it starts a timer and when it passes the next speed camera at a given distance it stops the timer. Then it takes the speed it took for the car to drive the given distance and then divide it by the given distance and then it comes out with the average speed of the car. Then we have to decide whether the car is breakage the speed limit or is under the speed limit.</p>  <p>This is what i have so far:</p>  <pre><code>from datetime import datetime  start = input("Press enter to start") starttime =(datetime.now()) stop = input("Press enter to stop") stoptime =(datetime.now()) dist1 = 0 dist2 = input("enter dist2:") time = stoptime-starttime print(time) distance = int(dist2) - dist1 print(distance) speed = int(distance)% time print(speed) </code></pre>
