<p>I am working on a camera Andoid app using QML based on Qt 5.5. I need a live filter on the camera's preview and I would like to use the best preview resolution available. In native java I could get all the supported preview resolutions using the method:</p>  <p>android.hardware.Camera::getParameters().getSupportedPreviewSizes();</p>  <p>And then choose the best one based on the screen resolution.  QML on the other hand, will automatically set the preview resolution which usually has aspect ratio 4:3 and this does not cover the hole screen like on the qml declerative-camera example. So is possible to change the preview resolution on a QML display?</p>  <p>Please note that I do not want to just zoom on the default preview to cover the whole screen. </p>  <p>Thanks</p>
