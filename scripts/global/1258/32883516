<p>below you can see the result of the optical flow if a camera makes a translation movement. If the camera makes a roll rotation the result looks like the second picture. Is it possible to retrieve the yaw angle from a camera if its only rotation around the yaw axis? I think in the optical flow you can recognize if the camera is rotating around the yaw axis (z-axis), but i don't know how to retrieve the information how much the cam has rotated. </p>  <p>I would be gradeful for any hints.
