<p>My objective is to have a custom camera, with a snap button (imgSnap), when this is pressed I want the app to go to another intent (CameraReview) where the image is shown in an imageview, here the user can select keep or delete. the code bellow works until I start the review intent, there it just pauses on the camera preview and breaks. I am unable to find the reason why this is.</p>  <pre><code>Button imgSnap = (Button)findViewById(R.id.imgSnap);             imgSnap.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {                 @Override                 public void onClick(View view) {                     mCamera.takePicture(null, null, null, new Camera.PictureCallback() {                          @Override                         public void onPictureTaken(byte[] data, Camera camera) {                             Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(), "Picture Taken",                                     Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();                             Intent intent = new Intent(x, CameraReview.class);                             intent.putExtra("image_arr", data);                             setResult(RESULT_OK, intent);                             webView.startActivity(intent);                             camera.stopPreview();                             if (camera != null) {                                 camera.release();                                 mCamera = null;                             }                             finish();                         }                     });                 }             }); </code></pre>  <p>Edit: The following exception is thrown:</p>  <pre><code>Camera is being used after Camera.release() was called </code></pre>
