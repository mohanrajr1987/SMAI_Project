<p>I am working on android camera application, and I found a code to start with: </p>  <p><a href="http://examples.javacodegeeks.com/android/core/hardware/camera-hardware/android-camera-example/" rel="nofollow">http://examples.javacodegeeks.com/android/core/hardware/camera-hardware/android-camera-example/</a></p>  <p>But I faced two problems that I couldn't understand. The first one is in this part: </p>  <pre><code>@Override public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {     super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);      setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);     getWindow().addFlags(WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON);     myContext = this;     initialize(); } </code></pre>  <p>In fact, I didn't understand what is initialize() and what the purpose of it? I searched for it but I didn't find anything!</p>  <p>The second problem is in this part:</p>  <pre><code>public void onResume() {     super.onResume();      if (!hasCamera(myContext)) {          Toast toast = Toast.makeText(myContext, "Sorry, your phone does not have a camera!", Toast.LENGTH_LONG);         toast.show();         finish();     }     if (mCamera == null) {          //if the front facing camera does not exist          if (findFrontFacingCamera()  1) {              //release the old camera instance              //switch camera, from the front and the back and vice versa              releaseCamera();             chooseCamera();          } else {             Toast toast = Toast.makeText(myContext, "Sorry, your phone has only one camera!", Toast.LENGTH_LONG);             toast.show();         }     } }; </code></pre>  <p>I didn't understand this expression: <code>if (findFrontFacingCamera()  1).</code>  Because <code>findFrontFacingCamera()</code> is not <code>boolean</code> and there is problem in 1!</p>
