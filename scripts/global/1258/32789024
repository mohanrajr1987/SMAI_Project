<p>I'm having difficulty with the Samsung S4 mini.  Like many others developing camera apps the S4 mini seems to be a problematic device.</p>  <p>The device has the following preview modes available;</p>  <p>960x720, 1280x720, 1392x1392, 960x540, 320x240, 640x480, 720x720, 720x480, 144x176, 176x144</p>  <p>The screen resolution of the device is 540x960.</p>  <p>I'm using the common determineBestPreview function that most people developing camera apps are using which chooses 540x960 as the best preview mode.  I'm using the camera in portrait mode and rotating the preview through 90 degrees.</p>  <p>The trouble is that the preview is stretched (people look very thin and stretched vertically.  I have tried many things, including allowing the user to change the preview mode.  Every single preview mode seems to have the same effect.  I have also changed the surface view to stretch beyond the bounds of the display (which in this case is futile since it's the same).</p>  <p>Every phone I've tested on (Xperia S, Xperia z3 compact, one plus one, nexus 5, galaxy s6, nexus 7) has worked except this one device.  I'm at the point now where I've spent so much time that I'm thinking of excluding it from my supported devices.  What makes it more difficult is that I don't own the device which makes it harder to debug.</p>  <p>Has anyone else solved this problem?</p>
