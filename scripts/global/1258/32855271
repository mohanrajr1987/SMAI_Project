<p>My buffergeometry disappears after moving the camera to close. You can also see that in drawcalls Three.js <a href="http://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_buffergeometry_drawcalls" rel="nofollow">example</a> that has <code>TrackballControls</code>. In my case it's alot worser. My points disappear at the distance from 0 to 400 and my lines disappear at the distance from 0 to 100. My objects are working fine with a simple geometry but not with a buffergeometry. I found out that it has something to do with the centroid of the buffergeometry. I tryed to use different camera's, to change the camera range and still it doesn't work. How can I stop my objects to disappear after moving the camera?</p>  <p><strong>Update</strong></p>  <p>Got it working by adding <code>linesMesh.frustumCulled = false;</code> and removing <code>geometry.computeBoundingSphere();</code>. Thanks for all the help.</p>
