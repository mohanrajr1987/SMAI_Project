<p>I was recently using the <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/WebCamTexture.html" rel="nofollow">WebCamTexture API in Unity</a>, but ran across a couple issues.</p>  <p>My biggest issue is orientation. When I ran the app on my phone, it wouldn't work properly in portrait mode: the image was orientated so it was landscape while the phone was portrait. Rotating the phone didn't help.</p>  <p>Then I changed the default orientation of the app to landscape and it worked, but the image was reflected: letters and such would be backwards in the image. Rotating the image 180 on the y-axis didn't help since it was a 1 sided image.</p>  <p>Here's the code for the camera alone:</p>  <pre><code>cam = new WebCamTexture(); camImage.texture = cam; camImage.material.mainTexture = cam; cam.Play (); camImage.transform.localScale = new Vector3(-1,-1,1); </code></pre>  <p>where camImage is a RawImage.</p>  <p>How would I rotate the image to work correctly in portrait as well as reflecting the image correctly? Am I using the API incorrectly?</p>
