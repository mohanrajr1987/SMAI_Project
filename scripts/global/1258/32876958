<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>  <p>Hi! I need some help. I have a really big issue in unity3d. When stray far away from (0, 0, 0) there are some floating-point precision issues, and that it’s normal.</p>  <p><strong>The Complete Explanation Of The Problem</strong></p>  <p>If i create 2 cubes or more in the scene and i place one in another as a child with a distance between them and i go far away in the scene, the 2 cube will « «  and they are not able to keep the child are not able to keep the good distance.</p>  <p>For exemple a rigged model will be the best example for show a view of the importance of that problem.</p>  <p><em>Here’s an like from an youtube video:</em> youtube.com/watch?v=fqeEKE0p90E</p>  <p><strong>Understanding The Problem</strong></p>  <p>Why the child object aren’t able to keep the correct distance to the parent.</p>  <p>In unity3d the vector take float parameters. The float have a precision to only 7 digits.</p>  <p>The mathematic formule to calculate that distance called magnitude it’s:</p>  <pre><code>point A(x, y, z) = A(20, 20, 20) point B(x, y, z) = B(10, 10, 10)  magnitude = √(Ax-Bx)^2 + (Ay-By)^2 + (Az-Bz)^2 magnitude = √(20-10)^2 + (20-10)^2 + (20-10)^2 magnitude = √10^2 + 10^2 + 10^2 magnitude = √100 + 100 + 100 magnitude = √300 magnitude = 17.32050807568877... </code></pre>  <p>So the float have only 7 digits of precision, that mean all of the decimals situated after the 7th digit will be erased. That mean, the child object doesn’t keeped the exact position.</p>  <p><strong>Solving the problem</strong></p>  <p>I am 100% shore than there are a lot of ways to fix that, but personally i don’t have any idea how to do it.</p>  <p>Rust have a ViewModel system. It’s something that recalculate the position or display the 3d model correctly or i don’t know but it work very well.</p>  <p><strong>Rust team explain a bit his ViewModel System here:</strong> http ://garry.tv/2014/04/07/unity-viewmodels/</p>  <p>I have made an injector for rust for checking how it work in the scene. There are a GameObject called "__View Model Root" It have attached to it the ViewModel script. The __View Model Root contains also some 3d models. I don’t know more that that.</p>  <p><strong>Important Informations</strong></p>  <p><em>I have decompiled Rust and i have uploaded all of source code on GitHub.</em></p>  <p><em>RUST SOURCE CODE HERE :</em> <a href="https://github.com/HexHash/LegacyRust" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/HexHash/LegacyRust</a></p>  <p>The principals classes for the ViewModel System are:</p>  <pre><code>CameraFX.cs, ICameraFX.cs, ViewModel.cs, MountedCamera.cs, MountCamera.cs, ViewModelAttachment.cs, ViewModelTester.cs, VMAttachmentSocketOverride.cs, ItemRepresentation.cs, IHeldItem.cs, etc... </code></pre>  <p><em>Here are some screenshots of result of the injector:</em> <a href="http://pastebin.com/BEgz2vf6" rel="nofollow">http://pastebin.com/BEgz2vf6</a></p>  <p>I need help, it’s very important if i can’t fix that problem i can’t continue my project. Thanks much.</p>
