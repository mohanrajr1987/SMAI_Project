<p>I need to upload to hosting my old Symfony 1.4(propel) project. The hosting has several projects, I uploaded the project in subdirectory and as a result all *.css and *.js and images has wrong urls, Im debugger i see that refs are invalid as this subdirectory is not in this url. I have not worked with Symfony for a long time and as far as I remeber I always put project into the root of hosting and I did not have such problems...</p>  <p>In root of project in .htaccess I have :</p>  <pre><code>AuthType Basic  RewriteEngine On RewriteRule ^(.*)$    /web/$1    </code></pre>  <p>urls work ok Site  <a href="http://dev2.softreactor.com/Demo_Ads/web/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://dev2.softreactor.com/Demo_Ads/web/index.php</a></p>
