<p>I've been trying for the last two days to set up OrangeHRM, which uses Symfony 1.x on Eclipse, so I could create a new module.</p>  <p>I've already googled, looked through the wiki articles and googled some more.</p>  <p>The question is: How can I include symfony 1.x, which is available from the symfony archive into Eclipse 4.4 Luna (or any version of it), so I can create a new module on OrangeHRM? </p>  <p>Thank you. Kind Regards, Alex</p>
