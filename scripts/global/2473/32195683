<p>I want to create a new tab in OrangeHRM to add some facility to get customized reports. I followed the steps in the website <a href="http://vizteck.com/blog/6-steps-how-write-new-module-orange-hrm/" rel="nofollow">http://vizteck.com/blog/6-steps-how-write-new-module-orange-hrm/</a> and managed to set up and display a new tab. Now when I try to write some code in the newly created tab. I get an Error that the tab is not enabled.</p>  <p>Can anyone help me on How to enable this tab?</p>
