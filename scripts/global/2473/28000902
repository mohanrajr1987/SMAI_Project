<p>Sorry if the question sounds stupid, but I'm not too experienced with PHP but I must style some parts of this <a href="http://siwapp.org" rel="nofollow">abandoned open source app</a> built on Symfony and Twig.</p>  <p>So I have <code>template.yml</code> and its the ONLY place where these invoice templates are, I did a grep search to confirm. File contents looks like so:</p>  <pre><code>Template:   Template_1:     name: Invoice Template     slug: invoice-template     models: Invoice     template:        .... </code></pre>  <p>Its HTML and CSS which when I edit has no effect on the app. I tried disabling the cache in <code>settings.yml</code>:</p>  <pre><code>prod:   .settings:     no_script_name:         true     logging_enabled:        true     error_reporting:        &lt;?php echo ((E_ALL | E_STRICT) ^ E_NOTICE)."\n" ?&gt;     web_debug:              true     cache:                  false </code></pre>  <p>and I also did:</p>  <p><code>./symfony cache:clear</code></p>  <p>... but no luck. What am I doing wrong here? And yes I checked the path several times, its not that I'm editing the wrong or local file.</p>
