<p>you all might know that browsers do preflighted HTTP requests in some cases:  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS#Preflighted_requests" rel="nofollow">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS#Preflighted_requests</a></p>  <p>My web application is still on Symfony1. I want to implement a RESTful service and therefore using Symfony routing to allow specific HTTP request methods like GET or POST (<a href="http://symfony.com/legacy/doc/reference/1_4/en/10-Routing#chapter_10_sub_sf_method" rel="nofollow">http://symfony.com/legacy/doc/reference/1_4/en/10-Routing#chapter_10_sub_sf_method</a>).</p>  <p>Example:</p>  <pre><code>login:   url:   /v1/login   class: sfRequestRoute   param: { module: rest, action: login }   requirements:     sf_method: [post, put, delete]     #sf_method: [options] NOT WORKING </code></pre>  <p>It seems to me that OPTIONS requests cannot be defined/handled as sf_method value. Because I couldn't find any information if my idea is right, I'm wondering if I'm right or maybe there is a solution I couldn't find, too.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
