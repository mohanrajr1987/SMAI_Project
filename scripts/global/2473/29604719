<p>I am working on a Symfony-1.1 project. It has inbuilt session cookie named "symfony" in factories.yml. When I try to reset it in my action/code then other sessions/cookies are not updating/creating as I see from firebug. I dont know how to disable the inbuilt session cookie named 'symfony'. The portion of code which represents factories.yml file</p>  <pre><code>  storage:          class: sfSessionStorage          param:               session_name: symfony </code></pre>  <p>My code inside the action which is getting and setting the session cookie is as follows:</p>  <pre><code>        $randnum = rand(1111111111111,9999999999999); //1         $this-&gt;getResponse()-&gt;setCookie('symfony', $randnum); //2 resetting the inbuilt session cookie named "symfony"         $this-&gt;getResponse()-&gt;setCookie('myuser', $randnum); //3         $this-&gt;getUser()-&gt;setAttribute('myuser', $randnum); //4         $this-&gt;getResponse()-&gt;setCookie('helloindia', $randnum); //5 </code></pre>  <p>Here in above code, in line//2 where I reset the inbuilt session cookie named "symfony", after that line//2 I can not set the other cookies and sessions.</p>  <p>How to change or disable that inbuilt session cookie ?</p>
