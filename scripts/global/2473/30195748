<p>I'm upgrading an old web application developed with Symfony 1.4.</p>  <p>I'm having some issues related to page routing after list pagination:</p>  <p>The url </p>  <pre><code>www.mysite.com/admin.php/ev  </code></pre>  <p>routes to template file</p>  <pre><code>apps/frontend/modules/category/templates/showSuccess.php </code></pre>  <p>In this file I create a table (populated with some data retrieved from db: the table is paginated in order to show N lines at a time. The code is similar to the one described in <a href="http://symfony.com/legacy/doc/jobeet/1_4/en/07?orm=Doctrine" rel="nofollow">http://symfony.com/legacy/doc/jobeet/1_4/en/07?orm=Doctrine</a></p>  <p>Pagination generates links to the remaining pages of the table paginated, with urls such</p>  <pre><code>www.mysite.com/admin.php/ev?page=2 </code></pre>  <p>The problems stem from the fact that, following these links, the framework shows an error in page routing . </p>  <p>What should I set to match these urls to the corresponding pages of the paginated table?</p>
