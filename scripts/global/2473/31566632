<p>I am new to Symfony, but have experience with other web frameworks eg Ruby on Rails.</p>  <p>I'm trying to modify a web page, and I traced the template to a particular file: <code>cache/backend/dev/modules/autoUsers/templates/indexSuccess.php</code></p>  <p>If I update this file, the web page is updated.</p>  <p>However, this file is not in the git repository.  And given the top directory is called <code>cache</code>, I surmise that this file was generated by Symfony.  So modifying this file directly is probably not the right solution.</p>  <p>I'm trying to understand how the cache file is generated, how I can find the places of the real source files to make the change.  Can someone explain please?</p>  <p>After I make the changes, how can I then regenerate the cache file? Or is this something handled automatically by Symfony/PHP?</p>  <p>Thanks you.</p>
