<p>I found that in Symfony 1.x, the terms they use to describe MVC is different from many other PHP frameworks. For example,</p>  <p>The front-end and back-end in other frameworks might be called 'group' or 'module', while Symfony calls it 'app'</p>  <p>'Controllers' are called 'modules' in Symfony, and the <code>controller.class.php</code> is called action.class.php. This is very confusing, they call a 'controller' an 'action', and what's the name of the action method within each <code>action.class.php</code> file??</p>  <p><em>Anyone help explain the MVC term differences in Symfony and other frameworks?</em> </p>
