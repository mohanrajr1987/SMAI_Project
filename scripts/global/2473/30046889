<p>I have three tables (objects). The Foo table has a 1:N relationship defined with the table Bar. The table FooBar is used to define a N:M relationship between A and B.</p>  <p>I want to select all objects in Foo which have either a 1:N relationship with Bar or a N:M relationship using the same Criteria. So far, what I have is two different Criteria for each:  </p>  <pre><code>  $c1n = new Criteria();     $c1n-&gt;addJoin(FooPeer::ID, BarPeer::FOO_ID);    $cnm = new Criteria();     $cnm-&gt;addJoin(FooPeer::ID, FooBarPeer::FOO_ID);     $objects1N = FooPeer::doSelect($c1n);     $objectsNM = FooPeer::doSelect($cnm);   </code></pre>  <p>Is it possible to include both in the same criteria? And if it is, how can I achieve that?</p>
