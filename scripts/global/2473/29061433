<p>I just started using symfony for my work. does anyone has a trick to find out where a variable is defined. lets take this example:</p>  <p>in my template testSuccess.php I have a variable called $request.</p>  <p>I want to know where that variable $request is defined. Sure I can grep it, but the word $request doesn't sound that unique. and var dumping is kinda time consuming.</p>  <p>And get_defined_vars()... my gosh Symfony realy likes vars, I get this masive load of output, that's not very helpfull.</p>  <p>How do you guys locate where specific vars are declared?</p>  <p>Hh and by the way I use xdebug, not sure if that's a big help.</p>  <p>Ralph</p>
