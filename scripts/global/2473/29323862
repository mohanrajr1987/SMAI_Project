<p>I installed XAMPP with PHP5.3, but now on command line, php -v always uses the Mac OS10.10 build-in PHP5.5! But I need to use PHP5.3 instead. How to config so that I can use XAMPP PHP 5.3?</p>  <p>I tried to modified /etc/apache2/httpd.conf to load XAMPP's PHP module, but doesn't work.</p>  <p>PS, I need to change the command line PHP version as I need to use Symfony 1.x version(need to run symfony commands from command line)</p>
