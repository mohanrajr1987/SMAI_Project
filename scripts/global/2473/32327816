<p>I am using Symfony1 and am looking to get a large number of key statistics from one or two tables in the database over a period of time.</p>  <p>Am I better to write a small number of queries and then loop through the results to build up the statistics or is it more efficient writing smaller more specific database queries.</p>  <p>There are about 70-80 key statistics I am looking at and my initial thoughts were to write some big queries then populate a class with the statistics.</p>  <p>I have since thought though to extend the repository class with some simple queries that I could then pull via Ajax to ensure performance is good.</p>  <p>The whole process has led me to question what the best method is, so I thought I would ask the question to get some thoughts and other suggestions.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
