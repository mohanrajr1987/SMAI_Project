<p>I've got a simple form that includes an input that will take money, i.e. float. So far it can accept a well-formed decimal only, e.g. <code>12768.56</code>. The task to inject some server-side logic (no javascript here) that would intercept the input value, like <code>12 768,56</code>, replace it with <code>12768.56</code> and let symfony/doctrine do its work. The transformation is just an example and I'ev got what I need, but the question is - <strong>where should I put the intercepting function</strong>? I guess it should be somehwere in the <em>XxxForm.class.php</em>. But I don't know which method. <code>doSave</code>? <code>processData</code>? I'm pretty sure there is a special place for that...</p>
