<p>I'm working on a Symfony 1.4 (Doctrine) project with 2 language support (English and Bulgarian). From the backend I am able to add categories with titles on Bulgarian and English. Everything is fine until I try to add a title with Cyrillic letters. When I look into my database I see that the titles with Cyrillic letters are recorded as ???. I've already apllied <code>ALTER TABLE tablename CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;</code> to all tables but it doesn't help. Any suggestions?</p>
