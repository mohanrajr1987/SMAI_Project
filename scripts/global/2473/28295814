<p>I have a select query in Mysql table to fetch related table with a duplicate values in a specific column(date).This will successfully display columns and its foreign keys if it has duplicate values in a column.Example two rows same value of (2014-11-10) in a date column</p>  <pre><code>mysql&gt;select man_id,date_created,count(date_created) as count from collections group by man_id,date_created having count(date_created) &gt; 1; </code></pre>  <p>I want this query to convert to Doctrine query since I am using symfony 1.4 as a framework</p>  <pre><code> public function getDuplicateDatePayment() {     $q = $this-&gt;createQuery()               -&gt;select('man_id','date_created','count(date_created) as count')               -&gt;from('Collections')               -&gt;groupBy('man_id','date_created')               -&gt;having('COUNT(c.date_created) &gt; 1');         return $q-&gt;execute(); }  SELECT c.id AS c__id, c.man_id AS c__man_id FROM collections c GROUP BY c.man_id HAVING count(c.date_created) &gt; 1 //result 1 row </code></pre>  <p>why does doctrine query does not display results as expected?How to convert said doctrine query so that it will display result similar to SQL?</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Eze7c.png" alt="mysql command line"></p>  <p>//result 1141 rows</p>  <p>update</p>  <p>Collections table is related to Man table in a one to many relationship.Do i have to use innerJoin for this?</p>
