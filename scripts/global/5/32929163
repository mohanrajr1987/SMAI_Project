<p>I was wondering, I know that this forloop runs 10 iterations because I can see the echo statement 10 times (duh), but why is the email not sending through? There are times were some code similar to this works on my website and sends to the email I specified to send to, and there are other times when I tweak it a tad (like now), and it doesn't work. Why is this and thank you? :-)</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php $desiredAmountOfEmails = 10;  for($i = 0; $i &lt; $desiredAmountOfEmails+1; $i++) {          $to = "SOME SORT OF EMAIL";          $subject = "THIS IS THE SUBJECT OF THE EMAIL";          $txt = "THIS IS THE BODY OF THE EMAIL";          $headers = "From: abcdefghijkl" . $i . "@SOMEDOMAIN.COM" .   "\r\n" . "CC: SOMEEMAIL@SOMEWEBSITE.COM";          mail($to, $subject, $txt, $headers);          echo $i . " Emails sent.&lt;br&gt;"; }  ?&gt; </code></pre>
