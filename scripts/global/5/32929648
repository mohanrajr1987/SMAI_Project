<p>I am currently building a class for directory/file handeling for a project im working on. to make it more flexable I would like to find a way to make a dynamic if statement to handle exclusions. I can see it being helpfull else where as well. I would like to make it so  IF($file !=....  were some thing like </p>  <p>PUBLIC $filter = '$file != "."....';</p>  <p>IF($filter)</p>  <p>So that I could set $filter in the main program just before calling FileLib1\GetDirectory() currently I have the following inside of GetDirectory()</p>  <pre><code>        while ($file = readdir($handler))          {    // if file isn't this directory or its parent, add it to the results         //If $file !=  statement excludes things we dont want in the listing.           if ($file != "." &amp;&amp; $file != ".." &amp;&amp; $file !="0grp" &amp;&amp; $file !="0ren" &amp;&amp; $file != "unz.sh" &amp;&amp; $file != "index.php" &amp;&amp; $file != "galery.php" &amp;&amp; $file != "forward.jpeg" &amp;&amp; $file != "helper.html" &amp;&amp; $file != "image.php" &amp;&amp; $file != "reverse.jpeg")      {         $results[] = $file;         }          } </code></pre>
