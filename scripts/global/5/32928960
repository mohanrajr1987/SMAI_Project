<p>Use Case:</p>  <p>I'm building a site where users can search records - with SQL. BUT - they should also be able to save their search and be notified when a new submitted record meets the criteria.</p>  <p>It's not a car buying site, but for example: The user searches for a 1967 Ford Mustang with a 289 V8 engine, within the 90291 ZIP code. Can't find the right one, but they want to be notified if a matching car is submitted 2 weeks later.</p>  <p>So of course, every time a new car is added to the DB, I can retrieve all the user search queries, and run all of them over all the cars in the DB. But that is not scalable.</p>  <p>Rather than search the entire "car" table with every "search" query every time a new car is submitted, I would like to just check that single "car" object/array in memory, with the existing user queries. </p>  <p>I'm doing this in PHP with Laravel and Eloquent, but I am implementation agnostic and welcome any theoretical approaches.</p>  <p>Thanks,</p>  <p>Chris</p>
