<p>I'm building a script that reads an inbox such as ticket@mydomain.com, takes the sender, the datetime, the subject and the body of the email and inserts it into a Help Desk database system. That way, the customer can just send an email to the address instead of having to access the system and open the ticket.</p>  <p>When a tech answers the ticket inside the system, I have a script that sends an email to the customer from PHPMailer library. Now, I'd like to <strong>replace this script</strong> with an script that is capable of replying the original email instead of sending a new one non-related with the original. That way, the customer sees his own email being replied and I can attach a protocol number to the email in case the customer answer again.</p>  <p><em>Extra:</em> I'm creating this topic because I'm having a hard time finding the right words to search. Every search on Google takes me to a 'reply-to' subject. Notice that I <strong>do not</strong> want to add a 'Reply-to' header to an email being sent from php. I'm not talking about the receiver being able to reply an email sent from php, I'm talking about PHP being able to reply an email received.</p>  <p>TL;DR. I receive an email at a ticket@mydomain.com mailbox. I want to reply that email from a PHP script. I don't want to send a new email, I want to reply the original email.</p>  <hr>  <p><strong>Update</strong> Since I got a close vote as "too broad" question, I'd like to try and specify more what I want to do.</p>  <ul> <li>A customer <strong>A</strong> sends an email to ticket@helpdesk.com with a problem.</li> <li>A script that is executed every 5 minutes reads the inbox of the ticket@helpdesk.com, takes all unread emails and inserts them into a database.</li> <li>A tech sees inside a HelpDesk system a new ticket open. Through the interface of the system, the tech answers that ticket providing with a solution for the problem.</li> <li>The PHP answers the email that was previously used to create the problem. That way, the customer can see what he wrote to the Help Team and what they replied to him.</li> </ul>  <p>Notice that I'm not talking about adding a header with a reply-to information in the php mail() function.</p>  <p>I'm not talking about just sending a new email from php.</p>  <p><strong>I'm talking about executing the steps of adding a reply to an existing email.</strong> Is it possible? What should I be searching for?</p>
