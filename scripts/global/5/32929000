<p>So I've just upgraded mysql from 5.5 to 5.6 but have kept the current php version of 5.3.27. After the upgrade I keep getting the error:</p>  <p>PHP Warning:  mysql_connect() function.mysql-connect function.mysql-connect Headers and client library minor version mismatch. Headers:50536 Library:50616</p>  <p>Site still works fine no problems but a ton of error logs are being generated how do I turn of the error from being logged. </p>  <p>Or what is the safest way to fix this without causing problems. Without having to rewrite all code. Currently I have to stick with 5.3.27 as if I was to upgrade I would have to change a lot of stuff therefore upgrading php in not a option. </p>  <p>Is there a way to turn off this specific error from logging?</p>
