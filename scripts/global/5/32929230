<p>I have been trying to to my phpstorm configured to auto complete. So far, I managed to make $this auto complete correctly in a view. However I am having problems getting it's sub classes to auto complete. </p>  <p>Currently I am using</p>  <pre><code>/* @var $this \Zend\View\Renderer\PhpRenderer */ </code></pre>  <p>Example: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/kMTHm.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/kMTHm.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>As you can see, $this->navigation does not contain menu(), however it does contain other method calls.</p>
