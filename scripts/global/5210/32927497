<p>I'm trying to send a post request to a local IP (on a 10...) but I kept getting this error:</p>  <pre><code>No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. </code></pre>  <p>So after doing some research I found that I need to set this to * using setRequestHeader, but after doing so I now get this error:</p>  <pre><code>net::ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE </code></pre>  <p>I am using JS with XMLHTTPRequest.</p>  <p>Here is my code:</p>  <pre><code>var printerIP = "10.0.211.180";   var zpl = "%5EXAHello%5EXZ";   var params = "data=" + zpl;  params += "&amp;" + "dev=R";  params += "&amp;" + "oname=UNKNOWN";  params += "&amp;" + "otype=ZPL";  params += "&amp;" + "prev=Preview+Label";  params += "&amp;" + "pw=";   var method = 'POST'; var async = true; var request = new XMLHttpRequest();  request.open(method, url, async);  request.setRequestHeader("Content-type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"); request.setRequestHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");  request.onload = function() {  var responseText = request.responseText;  alert(responseText);  // process the response. };  request.onerror = function() {   alert('There was an error!'); };  request.send(params); </code></pre>  <p>I would post images of what things look like but apparently I need 10 reputation...</p>  <p>The whole point in what I am trying to do is send some ZPL to a printer and bring back a label preview from a web app instead of using the printer  web server, but am unable to get this to work...</p>
