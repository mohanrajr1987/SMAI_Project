<p>I have an assignment where </p>  <p>"The objective of this assignment is to practice network programming and learn about applica- tion layer protocols. Specifically, you will implement an <code>HTTP client</code> program to download web objects from various web servers on the Internet"</p>  <p>I cannot use <code>URL class</code> or <code>URLConnection</code> class.  So this makes it a little harder.</p>  <p>I know that the steps to create a connection would be to create a Socket and then connect to the URL and use a Buffered I/O stream to communicate with the server.   </p>  <p>I've been looking for examples online but all use <code>URL</code> and <code>URLConnection classes</code>.</p>  <p>So My thought process is </p>  <ol> <li><p>Create Socket - bind it to the <code>url + port 80</code> (I found that port 80 is for http requests? Could be wrong)</p></li> <li><p>Create <code>I/O stream</code> to socket</p></li> <li><p>Handshaking (I don't know exactly how this works yet)</p></li> <li>Request Download</li> <li>Cache</li> </ol>  <p>Is my thought process correct?  And also how to I implement downloading lets say an image from the Server once I get a proper response?  </p>
