<p>I'm trying to write the standard response message to my brower when the browser connects, but the results do not display on my browser.</p>  <p>Here is the code</p>  <pre><code>Socket sock;  PrintWriter writeSock;  BufferedReader readSock; writeSock = new PrintWriter(sock.getOutputStream(),true); writeSock.print("HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n" + "Hello world"); </code></pre>  <p>do I print to the writeSock to get it to show on the browser? I'm confused at how to put a standard HTTP response in java.  </p>
