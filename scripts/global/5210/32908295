<p>I have found two methods of making a "post" documented on the <a href="http://www.python-requests.org/en/latest/" rel="nofollow">requests site</a></p>  <p>1: <code>requests.request(method, url, **kwargs)</code> source: <a href="http://requests.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api/#requests.Request" rel="nofollow">http://requests.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api/#requests.Request</a></p>  <p>2:  <code>r = requests.post(url, data={"url": post_url, "token": token, "f":"json"})</code> source:<a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/quickstart/#more-complicated-post-requests" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/quickstart/#more-complicated-post-requests</a></p>  <p>I had an issue where I could only get the first method to work which is posted on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32876220/updating-esri-rest-services-with-post">this SO thread</a>.  Why is this the case? And what are the differences between the two.  </p>  <p>I did not have to use <code>requests.request("GET", url, **kwargs)</code> because  <code>requests.get(url)</code> worked which I found not to be true for <code>post</code></p>
