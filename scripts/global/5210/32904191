<p>Hi i was wondering if I can get a python script to stay on the asked webpage for a couple of seconds before closing the connection with the webpage that's what i tried but it disconnects as soon as the respond comes in</p>  <pre><code>import urllib3  http = urllib3.PoolManager() r = http.request('GET', 'http://example.com/') i = 0 while i &lt;= 300 :     i = i + 1     time.sleep(7)     print (i);     time.sleep(3)     if i == 300 :         break </code></pre>
