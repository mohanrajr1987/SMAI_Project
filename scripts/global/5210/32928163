<p>For understanding i experiement at the moment with Webservers in C#.   I know how to handle requests like this (part of all code)</p>  <pre><code> p.outputStream.WriteLine("&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;h1&gt;test server&lt;/h1&gt;"); </code></pre>  <p>Which will return when there is a incoming Request as example when Browser reload the Site. </p>  <p>My Question is now:  How can i send Post Headers or something to the Browser? Like the Webserver is sending the actually Time every Secound to the Browser and the Browser is showing it in realtime? I was hearing something about sending Https to a Website oO ? At least what i want is displaying the Time in realtime or changing a text in realtime and the Browser is showing the change of a Text in realtime. </p>  <p>Is this possible at least or is it a wrong way?  I prefer to dont use any Plugins, Classes or something else.</p>
