<p>In my own app, I'm using various 3rd party SDKs that make network calls( HTTP requests) in some form or other. Without editing this code, can I write code separately within the application to intercept all GET and POST requests that my app is making?</p>  <p>I want to record these HTTP calls in my app</p>  <p>I am aware of using <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/cloud_and_mobile/2014/06/sniffing-http-traffic-on-an-android-device.html" rel="nofollow">Fiddler</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22077533/eclipse-android-how-to-monitor-devices-http-traffic">Charles proxy tools</a> but that is outside the app but this won't work because I can't record these HTTP calls in my app.</p>  <p>Is there a way to do it?</p>  <p>EDIT: I am using Google Analytics SDK and Facebook SDK in my code. I want to monitor all the network calls these SDK's are making from my app </p>
