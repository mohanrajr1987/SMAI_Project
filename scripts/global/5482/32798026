<p>I have this code right now:</p>  <pre><code>void performAction(int n){   int i;   int returnValue;   pthread_t p;    for(i=1; i &lt; n; i++){     printf("Iteration %d",i);     pthread_create(&amp;p, NULL, donothing, NULL);     pthread_join(p, (void**)&amp;returnValue);     if(returnValue == 0){       printf("Terminated");     }   } }  void* donothing(){   pthread_exit ((void*)0); } </code></pre>  <p>My task is to start n processes with pthread create and immediately join them, to wait for their termination.</p>  <p>I get to the <code>printf("Terminated");</code> after every "Iteration %d", but it never seems to increment.</p>  <p>Right now all I get is an infinite loop of this output:</p>  <pre><code>Iteration 1 Terminated Iteration 1 Terminated ... </code></pre>  <p>Why is this a infinite loop here? I don't quite understand it.</p>
