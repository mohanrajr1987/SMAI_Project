<p>I am trying to find an easy way to sleep or stop executing, and wake another (so not the calling ) thread in C. It shoud work like this:</p>  <pre><code>main() {     int msg = 0;     ptread_t t;     pthread_create(&amp;t, NULL, work, NULL)     while(1)     {         msg = recieve_msg();         switch(msg)         case 1:              //sleep_pthread(t);              break;         case 2:              //wake_pthread(t);              break;         default:              break;     } }  void work() { //do whatever it needs to } </code></pre>  <p>recieve_msg() waits for a user action so I don't know how much time i have to stop the thread from execution. Where I need help is which functions should i use for those <strong>sleep_pthread(t);</strong> and <strong>wake_pthread(t);</strong> parts.</p>
