<p>From <a href="https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/pthreads/" rel="nofollow">https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/pthreads/</a>:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>A joining thread can match one pthread_join() call. It is a logical error to attempt multiple joins on the same thread. </p> </blockquote>  <p>Also from "man pthread_join":</p>  <blockquote>   <p>If multiple threads simultaneously try to join with the same thread, the results are undefined.</p> </blockquote>  <p>However, from programmer's point of view, it makes a perfect sense that multiple threads may want to wait for a single thread to complete (similar to barriers).</p>  <p>For example, we may have thread1, thread2 running independently, and we may want both threads to wait until thread3 is completed.</p>  <p>Is there any technical reason behind this restriction?</p>
