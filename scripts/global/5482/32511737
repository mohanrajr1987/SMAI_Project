<p>I have a C program where I'm calling an embedded Python module on a Linux machine using:</p>  <pre><code>Py_Initialize();      PyObject_CallFunction(PyFun)  Py_Finalize(); </code></pre>  <p>My question is: will the python function still be running in the same thread as the C function? How do I check this?</p>  <p>I was using <code>thread.get_ident()</code> in python and <code>pthread_self()</code> in C to print the thread ID. But I'm not sure whether they mean the same thing.</p>
