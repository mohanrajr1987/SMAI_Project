<p>If I have such a loop </p>  <pre><code>for (int j=0;u&lt;100)     for (int i=0;i&lt;4;i++)          pthread_create(&amp;(threads[i]), NULL, thread_func, NULL);      for (int i=0;i&lt;4;i++)     pthread_join(threads[i], NULL); } </code></pre>  <p>Is the overhead associated with creating the threads included in this case? or does it reuse the same thread over and over again? </p>  <p>and If it does what is the solution to avoid this overhead without using a thread pool? </p>
