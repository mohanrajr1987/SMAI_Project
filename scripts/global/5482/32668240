<p>To get perf statistics of parallel running threads -</p>  <p>To get list of threads I use thread list in /proc/self/task</p>  <p>Now I want to get ID of a thread's CPU time clock. But clock_getcpuclockid only works with PIDs.</p>  <p>pthread_getcpuclockid requires the pthread id of thread and I did not find any way to get pthread id from TId of thread so I am looking for any alternative solution to this problem. CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID will return information of current only and I need information of all parallel threads. Any suggestions are welcome.</p>  <p>Is there any alternative to pthread_getcpuclockid? I wonder what pthread implementation does inside ?</p>
