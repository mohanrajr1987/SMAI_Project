<p>By most accounts, David R. Butenhof's "Programming with POSIX Threads" is still a good introduction to pthreads.  It was published in 1997, though, so I'm curious what has changed in the field.  When reading it, what should one watch out for?</p>  <p>Perhaps another way to ask this question: "The C programming Language" is a great book to learn C, but one would not want to program in that style in a real C system (it omits error checking, there is no mention of c99 or newer features, no mention of POSIX, much less the alternative functions introduced in POSIX-2008).   "21st century C" and others are suggested as good "second books" on C.  What is pthreads "second book" ?</p>
