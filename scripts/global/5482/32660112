<p>I had a question about the <code>c.m4.pthreads</code> file in <code>parsec-3.0\pkgs\apps\blackscholes\src</code>.  From the Makefile, the c.m4.pthreads is used as a MACRO file.  But the macros inside the file are not regular C style macros.</p>  <p>For example,</p>  <pre><code>define(CREATE_WITH_ARG, `     {         int _M4_i;         for ( _M4_i = 0; _M4_i &lt; MAX_THREADS; _M4_i++) {             if ( _M4_threadsTableAllocated[_M4_i] == 0)    break;         }         pthread_create(&amp;_M4_threadsTable[_M4_i],NULL,(void *(*)(void *))$1,(void *)$2);         _M4_threadsTableAllocated[_M4_i] = 1;     } ') </code></pre>  <p>Any help?  Thanks.</p>
