<p>I'm using ExtJs 4.2 and my program currently suffers from a memory leak because over time it keeps a reference to a particular object inside the Ext.ComponentManager. I believe this is the only place that these constructors are being kept, but I'm not 100% sure how to go about proving this (my code base is very, very large).</p>  <p>By using the garbage collection button in Chrome Development Tools it will actually clean up some of the constructors, but a vast proportion of them remain. How can I force the ComponentManager to delete these constructors?</p>
