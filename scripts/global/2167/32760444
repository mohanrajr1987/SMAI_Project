<p>Looks like i found memory leak in my code, but i'm not sure, and i don't have so many experience with nodejs memory leaks. </p>  <p>Can someone explain me, can this code produce memory leak?</p>  <pre><code>    var tasks = [];      // each 10 seconds     tasks.push(function () {              console.log('hello, world!');      });      // each minute     while (tasks.length) {             var task = tasks.shift();             task();     } </code></pre>  <p><strong>UPD:</strong> Missed while loop in my code, updated now.</p>  <p>My question is, will scope of my anonymous function from array cleared from memory?</p>
