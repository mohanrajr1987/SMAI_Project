<p>Im running a python script on a raspberry pi that constantly checks on a Yocto button and when it gets pressed it puts data from a different sensor in a database.</p>  <p>a code snippet of what constantly runs is:</p>  <pre><code>#when all set and done run the program Active = True while Active:     if ResponseType == "b":         while Active:             try:                 if GetButtonPressed(ResponseValue):                     DoAllSensors()                     time.sleep(5)                 else:                     time.sleep(0.5)             except KeyboardInterrupt:                 Active = False             except Exception, e:                 print str(e)                 print "exeption raised continueing after 10seconds"                 time.sleep(10) </code></pre>  <p>the GetButtonPressed(ResponseValue): looks like the following:</p>  <pre><code>def GetButtonPressed(number):     global buttons     if ModuleCheck():         if buttons[number - 1].get_calibratedValue() &lt; 300:             return True     else:         print "module not online"     return False   def ModuleCheck():     global moduleb     return moduleb.isOnline() </code></pre>  <p>i'm not quite sure about what might be going wrong. but it takes about an hour before the RPI runs out of memory. </p>  <p>The memory increases in size constantly and the button is only pressed once every 15 minutes or so.</p>  <p>That already tells me that the problem must be in the code displayed above.</p>
