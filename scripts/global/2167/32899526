<p>I am using Dr. Memory to debug my code. It gives me the following message:</p>  <pre><code>INVALID HEAP ARGUMENT: allocated with operator new[], freed with operator delete </code></pre>  <p>However, whenever I use <code>delete[]</code> instead of <code>delete</code>, it gives me the same error. The error occurs in the following lines:</p>  <pre><code>for (int x = 0; x &lt; width; ++x) {     delete data[x]; } delete [] data; </code></pre>  <p>Variable <code>data</code> is being allocated as follows:</p>  <pre><code>data = new char*[width]; for (int i = 0; i &lt; width; ++i) {     data[i] = new char[1]; } </code></pre>  <p>Could someone please help me out?</p>
