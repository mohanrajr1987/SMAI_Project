<p>I've been trying to make a purely angular popup without using jquery. On click of the target I create the popup with a child scope compiled. On click outside of the popup it closes, sends the destroy, removes the element and clears out any pointers which I keep in a popup object, like so: </p>  <pre><code>scope.removePop = function() {   window.removeEventListener('click', handler);   popup.scope.$destroy();   document.body.removeChild(popup.element);   popup = {}; }; </code></pre>  <p>My problem is that if I open and close the popup 9 times, there are 9 child scopes still lingering as memory leaks. </p>  <p>Here is the fiddle: <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/nbs8nn30/2/" rel="nofollow">https://jsfiddle.net/nbs8nn30/2/</a></p>  <p>If the element is removed, the scope is destroyed, and the events and references are removed, why am I still seeing this in the console?:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/JPj1L.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/JPj1L.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
