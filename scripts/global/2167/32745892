<p>I'm working on tracking down a memory leak in my C# app. </p>  <p>My first way of going about this was to start a background worker which prints out the result of <code>GC.GetTotalMemory()</code> every 10 seconds to the console. </p>  <p>My leak takes some time to appear, so next I downloaded CLR Profiler. After the console showed I was constantly up around 30-40 MB, I hit "Show heap now".

So why do they appear to disagree (significantly) about how much memory my app is using?</p>
