<p>I've been doing development on a Cordova application that requires YouTube embed <code>iframes</code> to frequently be created, then subsequently destroyed when the user leaves that view. We've found that it only takes around 40 <code>iframe</code> loads and destroys for the application to crash due to memory shortage on an iPhone 4S (512 MB of RAM).</p>  <p>I've been investigating this, and it seems even iOS Safari exhibits this behaviour. If I do the same addition and removal of a YouTube embed <code>iframe</code> a couple dozen times, eventually I get a memory warning and sometimes page reload. Here's a graph of the free memory over time via Instruments, note the flag at the end signifying the low memory warning:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/HdFrH.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/HdFrH.png" alt="Instruments Profiling"></a></p>  <p>A YouTube embed obviously is a more challenging example, but I've even replicated this with a Wikipedia <code>iframe</code>, so don't think it's domain-specific.</p>  <p>So far I've been removing the <code>iframe</code> with <code>jQuery().remove()</code>, but obviously there's some memory usage that remains after the removal. Is there a more complete way to remove the <code>iframe</code> and any associated data in memory?</p>  <p>I've also tried clearing some of the <code>iframe</code> properties before removal, like so:</p>  <pre><code>var myIframe = $('iframe[src*="https://www.youtube.com/"]'); myIframe[0].src = 'about:blank'; myIframe[0].contentWindow.close(); myIframe.remove(); </code></pre>  <p>But the memory still isn't being properly freed up.</p>  <p>Same process on Chrome for Android doesn't exhibit this. Safari and Chrome on OS X seem ok, Firefox on OS X seems to be performing badly, but that's a bit off-topic.</p>  <p>Seems like a bug, <code>&lt;embed&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> also display this issue, so only fix might be via a bug report with Apple.</p>
