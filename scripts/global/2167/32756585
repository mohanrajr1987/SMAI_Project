<p>I created an air application with a schedule. To populate this schedule with appointment, I launch an httpservice and result is use to populate an array collection. Each time user change week, a new request is sending.</p>  <p>The variable myDataCalendar  (array collection) is defined as [Bindable] private var  myDataCalendar :ArrayCollection; I try to reuse the same  ArrayCollection, but I think making a mistake because memory increase each time, and garbage collector seems not working!</p>  <pre><code>  myDataCalendar = new ArrayCollection();   myDataCalendar.refresh(); </code></pre>  <p>So can you help me to understand memory leak.</p>  <p>Best regards</p>
