<p>I would like to create project with enabled Visual Studio memory leak detector (<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/pl-pl/library/e5ewb1h3(v=vs.90).aspx" rel="nofollow">Memory Leak Detector</a>)</p>  <p>It always worked fine and I could easily find memory leaks by running bunch of tests on my application and then checking the report.</p>  <p>But after statically linking OpenCV 3.0 to my project I got some false positives.</p>  <p>For instance the most frustrating error comes from <code>StereoBMImpl::compute</code> method and call: <code>ocl::useOpenCL()</code></p>  <p>After debugging I found the source of the "leak":</p>  <pre><code>TLSData&lt;CoreTLSData&gt;&amp; getCoreTlsData() {     static TLSData&lt;CoreTLSData&gt; *value = new TLSData&lt;CoreTLSData&gt;();     return *value; } </code></pre>  <p>After analyzing this code we know the static object is allocated only once and everything should be OK. But now I have bunch of false positive memory leak reports like:</p>  <pre><code>{1370349} normal block at 0x0E74D560, 24 bytes long.  Data: &lt;                &gt; FF FF FF FF 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  {1370348} normal block at 0x0E74D4E0, 64 bytes long.  Data: &lt;` t             &gt; 60 D5 74 0E CD CD CD CD CD CD CD CD CD CD CD CD  </code></pre>  <p>And now it's very difficult to find some real memory leaks in my application because there is set of false positives from OpenCV. I can't also run automatic memory leak tests because the output always contains some leaks.</p>  <p>Is there any way to remove these "pseudo" errors (if possible without changing OpenCV source code) ? It's very annoying.</p>  <p>I suppose other memory leaks detectors will also report some similar pseudo leaks because the <code>new</code> operator is executed without <code>delete</code> (object is automatically cleaned up by the OS).</p>
