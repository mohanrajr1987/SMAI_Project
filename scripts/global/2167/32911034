<p>I am monitoring a Java app through VisualVM and I can see that the heap memory stays relatively constant, however the Java process grows larger and larger in memory. </p>  <p>I understand that the Java memory consists of heap memory and the JVM+PermGen memory which involves all sort of things, but my java app is a GUI application and this supposed memory leak only happens if the GUI component are in a specific configuration.</p>  <p>I have done some research and apparently it is possible to get memory leak while staying within the heap size. What I don't understand is how my situation could be such a scenario.</p>  <p>Any idea how Swing manipulations might cause such a memory leak?</p>
