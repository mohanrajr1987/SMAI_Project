<p>My application uses both RMI and JDBC to talk to a remote system and a database.  While the database issues have been resolved, it turns out that RMI is causing some form of Memory Leak being detected by Tomcat 6 (I have also tried this with Tomcat 7 and we have the same issue).</p>  <p>Basically, when we start the application and the user enters information into the webpage, an RMI call is made to a backend system.  If we stop/start or restart the application, Tomcat Manager now can detect a memory leak.  If we start the application and do NOT make the RMI call, we can start/stop &amp; restart the application all day long without issues.</p>  <p>Does anyone know what needs to be done to prevent RMI calls from causing Memory Leaks in the WebappClassLoader upon reload or stop/start while the webserver is still running?</p>
