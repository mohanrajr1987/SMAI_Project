<p>I'm starting out in C++ and using memcheck to check my programs for memory leaks. </p>  <p>If (when...) there are leaks, I get the <code>Unfreed memory allocations remaining</code> output, which the uses of <code>new</code>, <code>malloc</code> etc which haven't been freed. These are typically accompanied by the source file and line number of the allocation, which makes it easy to fix.</p>  <p>Sometimes though the source module is listed as <code>unknown line:0</code>, for calls to <code>new</code> in my case. If memcheck knows a call to <code>new</code> has been made, how is it that it can't tell where this has come from? I'm just trying to get my head around this so I can have some idea where these leaks might be coming from.</p>
