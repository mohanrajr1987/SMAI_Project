<p>I am having hard memory leaks in my app. I need to call <code>CFStreamCreatePairWithSocketToHost</code> to establish a connection through a socket. It appears that there are leaks in this function. I read it is on to me to release the return of this function but I tried everything I know, leaks are still there... Could you please tell me how to free my memory so I can call the code below as many time I want without memory leaks ?</p>  <p>Here is my code :</p>  <pre><code>    var readStream : Unmanaged&lt;CFReadStream&gt;?     var writeStream : Unmanaged&lt;CFWriteStream&gt;?      CFStreamCreatePairWithSocketToHost(nil, "XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX", 2000, &amp;readStream, &amp;writeStream)      if let _ = readStream     {         self.inputStream = readStream!.takeRetainedValue()         self.inputStream?.delegate = self     }     if let _ = writeStream     {         self.outputStream = writeStream!.takeRetainedValue()         self.outputStream?.delegate = self     }      readStream?.release()     writeStream?.release()      self.inputStream?.scheduleInRunLoop(NSRunLoop.currentRunLoop(), forMode: NSDefaultRunLoopMode)     self.outputStream?.scheduleInRunLoop(NSRunLoop.currentRunLoop(), forMode: NSDefaultRunLoopMode)      self.inputStream?.open()     self.outputStream?.open() </code></pre>
