<p>I'm developing Java Web application using Spring/Spring Boot/MySQL and deployed it to Tomcat 8.</p>  <p>In Tomcat Web Application Manager I click <code>Reload</code> button and after successful redeploy - <code>Find Leaks</code> button and have a following message:</p>  <pre><code>The following web applications were stopped (reloaded, undeployed), but their classes from previous runs are still loaded in memory, thus causing a memory leak (use a profiler to confirm): /domain-api /domain-api </code></pre>  <p>My Tomcat log does not contain messages about possible memory leaks..</p>  <p>Looks like right now I have a 2 instances of my application(domain-api) up and running.. How to check it and how to fix it ?</p>
