<p>I faced some node.js memory weirdness, with react prerendering app. Here is memory profiling via newrelic:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/SwMV7.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/SwMV7.jpg" alt="Memory stats via newrelic"></a></p>  <p>As you can see â€“ once in an hour GC is freeing memory, when it comes up to 1GB. Is this okay for node.js (v0.12.x) or is something going wrong?</p>  <p>P.S. I read about newrelic's memory leaks, but turning it off provides the same results.</p>
