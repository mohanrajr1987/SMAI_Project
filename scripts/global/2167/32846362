<p>I have an application that was crashing in an Ubuntu server due to memory problems. We made a patch and I am monitoring it. I have 2 approaches to do so:</p>  <p>1- Heap dump using jmap  and Eclipse mat analyzer</p>  <p>2- A script that saves the <code>ps aux</code> output </p>  <p>In the heap dump, I can see that the number of object instances are allocated and deallocated as desired, which indicates that our patch successfully fixed the issue. However, when I take a look in the ps aux output, the RSS, %MEM and VSZ are still going up, which seems to indicate that the memory consumption is still rising.</p>  <p>Now I can't decide if the problem is fixed: the objects seems to be deallocated and my heap's size shrunk, but my <code>ps aux</code> information does not corroborates this.</p>  <p>Can I be assume that the patch fixed the issue? Is there any reason that the VSZ, RSS and %MEM do not decrease when doing a ps aux?</p>
