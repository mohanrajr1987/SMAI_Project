<p>I am looking forward to implement  a light weight memory leak detection tool. Through that tool I should be able to detect memory leaks and invalid memory access in a linux based c/c++ project.</p>  <p>I am not looking for something similar to Valgrind. Its really heavy. I am looking for some simple and light weight one.</p>  <p>What I have thought so far, I can overload malloc/free or new/delete and  keep track of memory allocated or freed.</p>  <p>Beyond I am not getting logic, how I can say confirmed way that memory leak happened or invalid memory is accessed.</p>  <p>Can somebody help me with logic part.</p>
