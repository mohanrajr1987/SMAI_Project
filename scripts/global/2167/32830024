<p>So I will be capturing a new image every 5 seconds from a .net executable that I will run on the server 24/7. So I am trying to create the most stable code that will use the least amount of memory and cpu as possible. I will be running multiple instances of this as well. </p>  <p>So should I declare the object as part of the class as below?</p>  <pre><code>Public Class ImageProcessForm      Dim MyImageObj as new MultiImageObj      ‘Call ProcessImage() every 5 seconds via timer      Private Sub ProcessImage ()          MyImageObj.Image = ImageFromStream()         MyImageObj.ResizeMedia()         MyImageObj.AddCaption(“My Caption”)         MyImageObj.Save(MyLocation)      End Sub </code></pre>  <p>Or should the MutliImageObj be created and destroyed each time in the subroutine?</p>  <pre><code>Public Class ImageProcessForm      ‘Call ProcessImage() every 5 seconds via timer      Private Sub ProcessImage ()          Using MyImageObj as new MultiImageObj             MyImageObj.Image = ImageFromStream()             MyImageObj.ResizeMedia()             MyImageObj.AddCaption(“My Caption”)             MyImageObj.Save(MyLocation)         End using  ‘MyImageObj disposed of  End Sub </code></pre>  <p>Or do you have a better suggestion?</p>
