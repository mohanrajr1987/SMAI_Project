<p>I wish to add a stroke around the points in my Google line chart.</p>  <p>From the <a href="https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/points" rel="nofollow">points-documentation</a> of Google Charts (bottom) we have that:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The following style customizations are available: [...]    - stroke-color (Specified as a hex string.)   - stroke-width (Specified as a hex string.)</p> </blockquote>  <p>I can't find the documentation of how to add these options. Anyone, who can figure it out?</p>
