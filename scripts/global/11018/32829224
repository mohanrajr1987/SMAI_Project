<p>I'm implementing Google Charts and providing the option to export them to PDF or Word.  In order to achieve this, I am calling the getImageURI() method after each chart is drawn.  These are on reports, and some reports have quite a few images.</p>  <p>On one that has nearly 100, Firefox is giving a warning message for a script that is taking too long.  If I remove the image creation part, it runs much faster.  However, I need to generate those at some point.</p>  <p>My first attempt was to run a new JavaScript method to do this when the Export to Word/Excel was clicked, prior to sending that command back to the server.  This works fine, <strong>but I can't get the animation of the cursor in progress to begin right away.</strong></p>  <pre><code>drawChartsWithImageGeneration: function () {      $("body").addClass("cursorProgress"); // changes cursor      $("div.chartContainer").each(function () {         var chartContainer = $(this);         drawChart(chartContainer);     });      $("body").removeClass("cursorProgress"); // changes cursor back } </code></pre>  <p>If I add a console.log() at the beginning of the function, it does execute immediately.  However, for some reason, the class is not added to the body tag until the drawChart() function completes and the PostBack ensues.</p>  <p>The Anchor tag that initiates this has the doPostBack on the href and the drawChartsWithImageGeneration on the onclick event.</p>  <p>(FYI: Using C#)</p>
