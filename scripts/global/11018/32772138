<p>I have a chart - I want to group values by month, and stack the numbers for each month by category.</p>  <p>This is the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zRt-qqv-BArLV0jJGbaE-NxnOWE0YLbTfPNCOI4hPAk/edit#gid=0" rel="nofollow">data</a>. The idea here is there is values that have dates, categories, and costs.</p>  <p>I'd like to display a stacked combo chart where the Y is month, the X is cost, but the bar displayed is stacked in sections by category.</p>  <p>Similar to something that looks like:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/bKovV.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/bKovV.png" alt="example:"></a></p>  <p><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/jeag1gva/43/" rel="nofollow">Here's my attempt</a> -- I'm close, I just can't get the categories to show/stack.</p>  <p>Code from attempt:</p>  <pre><code>var options = {     title: "Cost By Month/Category",     tooltip: {         showColorCode: true     },     isStacked: true,     yAxis: {         format: 'MMMM'     },     bars: 'vertical',     seriesType: 'bars' }; </code></pre>  <p>Any help?</p>
