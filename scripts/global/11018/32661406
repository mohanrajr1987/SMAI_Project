<p>Is it possible to add a <strong>custom point shape to a line chart</strong>?</p>  <p>Google's <a href="https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/points" rel="nofollow">Customizing Points Documentation</a> doesn't mention anything about adding shapes they don't already offer.</p>  <p>I did find this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29994405/google-charts-add-markers-to-linecharts-function">similar question</a> with a good answer, but I don't think I can do that using angular-google-chart. Even if it is possible, I'm hoping there is a more strait forward solution. </p>  <p>I don't need to add a complex shape, I just need a <strong>hollow circle</strong> and an <strong>X</strong>.</p>  <p>I tried adding the hollow circle using stroke-color and stroke-width as a column style, but I can't even get that to work. </p>  <p>Here is a <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/srrqh91b/1/" rel="nofollow">jsFiddle with a working hollow circle</a> but I'm using the Javascript Literal way of adding data and can't get the following code to work:</p>  <pre><code>chartData.data.cols = [         {             id: "someid",             label: "Some Label",             type: "number",             p: {                 style: 'point {stroke-width: 4; stroke-color: #000000',             },         },     ]; </code></pre>  <p>I'd rather add it to to <strong>options.series[0].strokeWidth</strong> but it doesn't look like that is an option. </p>  <p>So, if you can help with either hollow circle points or Xs that be awesome!</p>
