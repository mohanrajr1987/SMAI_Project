<p>I'm trying to find a way to get a google charts table report show clickable "drill down" links that will pull up a subreport based on the row/column that was clicked</p>  <p>for example, in the following table report, I would want the "63" for pizza in April, to be a url link that when clicked will pull up a subreport for pizza in April.   How can I do that?</p>  <pre><code>            Apr  May  Jun pizza       63    73   69     popcorn     68    63   61    </code></pre>
