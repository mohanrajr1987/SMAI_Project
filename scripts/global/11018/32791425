<p>I am new to using Google Charts and I cannot figure out why  my query is not displaying in my Google Chart (Table). The Table does however display another query. The Query that I am trying to display doesn't bring up a table like my first query does.</p>  <p>I cannot seem to understand where the problem is, because I tested my query several times and even ran it in SQL Server, and it does generate the output that I am looking for, but it simply doesn't display in the Table</p>  <p>Working Query:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT Researcher.FirstName + ' ' + Researcher.Surname AS [Researcher_Name], Count(Submission.SubmissionID) AS [Number_of_Submissions] FROM Submission INNER JOIN ((Faculty INNER JOIN School ON Faculty.FacultyID = School.[FacultyID]) INNER JOIN (Researcher INNER JOIN ResearcherSubmission ON Researcher.ResearcherID = ResearcherSubmission.ResearcherID) ON School.SchoolID = Researcher.SchoolID) ON Submission.SubmissionID = ResearcherSubmission.SubmissionID GROUP BY Researcher.FirstName, Researcher.Surname; </code></pre>  <p>This is the query that doesn't display the Google chart. <strong>Note</strong>: <em>when I run this query in my SQL generator however, it does display the results I am looking for:</em></p>  <pre><code>SELECT Submission.Title AS [Title], Submission.Status AS [Submission_Status] FROM Submission INNER JOIN ((Faculty INNER JOIN School ON Faculty.FacultyID = School.[FacultyID]) INNER JOIN (Researcher INNER JOIN ResearcherSubmission ON Researcher.ResearcherID = ResearcherSubmission.ResearcherID) ON School.SchoolID = Researcher.SchoolID) ON Submission.SubmissionID = ResearcherSubmission.SubmissionID GROUP BY Submission.Status, Submission.Title;
