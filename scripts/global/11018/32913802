<p>Is there a way to make the google BarChart to work like the PieChart?</p>  <p>The googleÂ´s PieChart sums all values you provided and give percentages. The BarChart does not do that when you work with horizontal columns, the length of the columns and the graph itself are based only on the values you provided and it does not label the horizontal axis with the percentage.  Even though I format it with 'percentage' it only adds the % simbol to the current values.</p>  <p>Is there any way of doing that?</p>
