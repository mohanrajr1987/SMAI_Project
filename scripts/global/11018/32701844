<p>I have a google line chart I'm using and in many cases the numbers on the axis represent decimals point. Obviously since my data represents people it makes no sense to show the axis in decimal points. I would like for them to rounded up to whole numbers. So far I've been toiling with the <code>format</code> option in the <code>xAxis</code> like so.</p>  <pre><code>  var options = {     legend: 'none',     hAxis: {       title: 'Dogs',       format: 'long'     }   }; </code></pre>  <p>However, the points on the xAxis are represented as decimals. The jsfiddle can be found <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/t17Lj6h9/2/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. What's wrong and how can I fix this?</p>
