<p>I'm trying to create a table with Google Charts where some data in the column names could be placed in a higher-level column name to help with readability. </p>  <p>In this example, I would like to move "Group 1" and "Group 2" to a 'higher' level; so the left table would end up like the right table.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/qevwu.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/qevwu.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I've read through documentation and haven't found a reference for this. Is it possible? If yes, what would be a good approach? Thanks.</p>
