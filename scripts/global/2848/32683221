<p>The expression is</p>  <pre><code>(y’+wy’(xz+xz’))z + (xy’+(x+y)’+z’)’ + y(z+wx’(w’+z)) </code></pre>  <p>I reduced it to just z (????)</p>  <p>I was wondering if anyone could check this, or give me general methods to solve? Since i really didn't know what i was doing. I basically just used x(y+z) = xy+xz and vice versa, however I feel like the answer isn't as simple as one variable.</p>
