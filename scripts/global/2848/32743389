<p>I have a file dedicated to the limited use of globals called globalVars.</p>  <p>Located within the .m file, is this code - which works correctly in the simulators and on my test devices.</p>  <pre><code>BOOL global4th = NO;  BOOL global8th = NO;   </code></pre>  <p>Currently, I'm trying to archive the project for alpha testing but I get the "Redefinition of 'global4th' with a different type: BOOL (signed char) vs bool" error.</p>  <p>Why is this?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
