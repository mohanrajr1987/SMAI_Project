<p>Okay, might not be the right title, but here's what I'm thinking. I am looking for a way to loop through a set of variables. For example, I'm thinking in my game there would be a series of things you could unlock, and when you entered "unlocked" or something it would show you what you had unlocked and <strong>only</strong> what you had unlocked. So it would show <strong>only</strong> the Booleans that  were false.</p>
