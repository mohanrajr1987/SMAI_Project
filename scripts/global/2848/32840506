<p>I'm quite new to the WCF Web Services, until now I used .asmx web services, and I never had problems similar to this.</p>  <p>I have a class Attachement which I use to save some attachments on web site.</p>  <pre><code>[DataContract] public class Attachement {     private string _Name;     [Column]     [DataMember(Order = 1)]     public string Name     {         get { return _Name; }         set { _Name = value; }     }     .     .     .     private bool _IsNew;     [DataMember(Order = 6)]     public bool IsNew     {         get { return _IsNew; }         set { _IsNew = value; }     }... </code></pre>  <p>The problem is that when I make some requests to WCF service, the field IsNew is always False, even if I'm sure that I'm sending it in request set to True. The same problem I have with a DateTime field - I send it with a value &lt;> DateTime.Min, but in the web service I always have this field equal with DateTime.Min.</p>  <p>I can fix this problem using the strings instead of bool and DateTime, but it's really annoying that I cannot parse this type of variables.</p>  <p>What am I doing wrong?</p>
