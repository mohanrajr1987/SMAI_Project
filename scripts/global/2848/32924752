<p>I have length(C) number of variables. Each index represents a uniqe type of variable (in my optimization model), e.g. wheter it is electricity generation, transmission line capacity etc..</p>  <p>However, I have a logical vector with the same length as C (all variables) indicating if it is e.g. generation: </p>  <pre><code>% length(genoidx)=length(C), i.e. the number of variables genoidx = [1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 ... 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0] </code></pre>  <p>In this case, there are 6 generators in 2 time steps, amounting to 12 variables. </p>  <p>I want to name each variable to get a better overview of the output from the optimization model, f.ex. like this:</p>  <pre><code>% This is only a try on pseudo coding varname = cell(length(C),1) varname(genoidx) = 'geno' (1 2 3 4 5 6 ... 1 2 3 4 5 6) varname(lineidx) = 'line' (...  </code></pre>  <p>Any suggestions on how to name the variables in C with string and number, based on logical ID-vector?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
