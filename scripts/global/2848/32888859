<p>So, I have an array, containing tuple instances of True and False that are determined by a user input. An example could look like this:</p>  <pre><code>array = [True, True, False, False, True, True, True] </code></pre>  <p>now, I want to check if these are fulfilling of certain conditions. My current attempt at this is:</p>  <pre><code>if (array[0], array[1], array[4], array[5], array[6]) is False and (array[2], array[3]) is True: </code></pre>  <p>Obviously, that is completely incorrect and not doing what I want it to do, but I honestly can't find the correct method anywhere. Any help?</p>  <p>edit - I may have confused you by not editing the name of my array when pasting my code. Sorry!</p>
