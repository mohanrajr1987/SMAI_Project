<p>I am having a heck of a time trying to figure out why I can't leave a loop. What I need to do is leave the loop if my Boolean, <em>forward</em>, is set to true. (The Boolean has been set to false above the while loop. </p>  <p>When I run the code snippet below I and enter a positive number I can only enter an unlimited amount a numbers. When I enter a negative number I get one prompt telling me that's not allowed and to try again. After than I am stuck in the similar situation above. It doesn't matter what I enter next it will just keep letting input over and over again. </p>  <pre><code>{         while (forward == false)             if (n2 == 0)             {                 System.out.println("Sorry, the 0 is not a valid entry for the second number, try again!");                 n2 = in.nextInt();             }                else              {                 forward = true;             }     } </code></pre>
