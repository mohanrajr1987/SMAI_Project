<p>I was reading through an API's documentation when I came across a curious little set of statements:</p>  <pre><code>self.use_ssl = kwargs.get('use_ssl', True) self.scheme = self.use_ssl and 'https://' or 'http://' </code></pre>  <p>After doing some personal testing, I found that if <code>self.use_ssl</code> was set to <code>True</code>, <code>self.scheme</code> would be set to use HTTPS, and HTTP if <code>self.use_ssl</code> was <code>False</code>. Awesomely pythonic, and I'll definitely be stealing this.</p>  <p>Can somebody explain exactly how this works? </p>
