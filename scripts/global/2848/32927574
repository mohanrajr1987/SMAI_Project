<p>Thank you in advance if you help me out with this. What I am trying to accomplish is to update a data frame filled with zeroes with a datetime index (my trade dataframe) using another dataframe (indexed_orders) on the same dates. My code is as follows:</p>  <pre><code>import pandas as pd import numpy as np import os import csv   orders = pd.read_csv('./orders/orders.csv', parse_dates=True, sep=',', dayfirst=True) #initiate orders data frame from csv data file indexed_orders = orders.set_index(['Date']) #set Date as index for orders print indexed_orders  symbol_list = orders['Symbol'].tolist() #creates list of symbols symbols = list(set(symbol_list)) #gets rid of duplicates in list   dates_list = orders['Date'].tolist() #creates list of order dates dates_orders = list(set(dates_list)) #gets rid of duplicates in list   start_date = '2011-01-05' #establish date range end_date = '2011-01-20'  dates = pd.date_range(start_date, end_date) #establish dates from start_date and end_date  trade = pd.DataFrame(0, index = dates, columns = symbols) #establish trade data frame trade['Cash'] = 0 #add column for future calculations print trade </code></pre>  <p>Which outputs for indexed_orders:</p>  <blockquote>   <blockquote>     <blockquote> <pre><code>           Symbol Order  Shares Date                            2011-01-10   AAPL   BUY    1500 2011-01-13   AAPL  SELL    1500 2011-01-13    IBM   BUY    4000 2011-01-26   GOOG   BUY    1000 2011-02-02    XOM  SELL    4000 2011-02-10    XOM   BUY    4000 2011-03-03   GOOG  SELL    1000 2011-03-03    IBM  SELL    2200 2011-06-03    IBM  SELL    3300 2011-05-03    IBM   BUY    1500 2011-06-10   AAPL   BUY    1200 2011-08-01   GOOG   BUY      55 2011-08-01   GOOG  SELL      55 2011-12-20   AAPL  SELL    1200 </code></pre>     </blockquote>   </blockquote> </blockquote>  <p>And outputs the following for trades:</p>  <blockquote>   <blockquote>     <blockquote> <pre><code>            GOOG  AAPL  XOM  IBM  Cash 2011-01-05     0     0    0    0     0 2011-01-06     0     0    0    0     0 2011-01-07     0     0    0    0     0 2011-01-08     0     0    0    0     0 2011-01-09     0     0    0    0     0 2011-01-10     0     0    0    0     0 2011-01-11     0     0    0    0     0 2011-01-12     0     0    0    0     0 2011-01-13     0     0    0    0     0 2011-01-14     0     0    0    0     0 2011-01-15     0     0    0    0     0 2011-01-16     0     0    0    0     0 2011-01-17     0     0    0    0     0 2011-01-18     0     0    0    0     0 2011-01-19     0     0    0    0     0 2011-01-20     0     0    0    0     0 </code></pre>     </blockquote>   </blockquote> </blockquote>  <p>I want to update my trades data frame on dates present in my idexed_orders, inserting the number of 'Shares' in the column under the correct 'Symbol' (which are the AAPL, IBM, GOOG, and XOM names in trades). I also want the value for 'Shares' to be negative when the 'Order' column in indexed_orders specifies 'SELL'.
