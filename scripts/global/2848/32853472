<p>below my code was working fine until my last if-else. It appears I've done something wrong with my boolean variables canGraduate and onProbation. Perhaps I'm reassigning them incorrectly in the prior if-else statements. The deadbranch occurs at the else half of my last if-else. Thank you for your time.</p>  <pre><code>package lab5; import java.util.Scanner; public class Lab5 {  public static void main(String[] args) {      //creates scanner object     Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);      //PART II     //creating variables     double gpa;     int totalCreditsTaken;     int mathScienceCredits;     int liberalArtsCredits;     int electiveCredits;     boolean canGraduate = true;     boolean onProbation = false;      //prompts user for imput     System.out.println("What is your GPA?");         gpa = scanner.nextDouble();     System.out.println("What's the total amount of credits you've taken?");         totalCreditsTaken = scanner.nextInt();     System.out.println("How many math and science credits have you taken?");         mathScienceCredits = scanner.nextInt();     System.out.println("How many liberal arts credits have you taken?");         liberalArtsCredits = scanner.nextInt();     System.out.println("How many elective credits have you taken?");         electiveCredits = scanner.nextInt();      //creates first "if" statment to determine if GPA is high enough to be on track or on probation      if (gpa &lt; 2.0){         System.out.println("You're on academic probation.");         onProbation = true;     }      //PART III     //creates a conditional to see if there's enough credits to graduate      if (totalCreditsTaken &lt; 40 ){         System.out.println("You need more credit(s) to graduate.");         canGraduate = false;     }     else{         System.out.println("Examining credit breakdown...");         canGraduate = true;     }      //PART VI     //Nested if-else if-else to determine if the student qualifies for BA or BS     if ((mathScienceCredits &gt;= 9) &amp;&amp; (electiveCredits &gt;= 10)){         System.out.println("You qualify for a BS degree.");         canGraduate = true;     }     else if ((liberalArtsCredits &gt;= 9) &amp;&amp; (electiveCredits &gt;= 10)){         System.out.println("You qualify for a BA degree.");         canGraduate = true;     }     else{         System.out.println("You currently don't meet the degree requirments.");         canGraduate = false;     }      //PART V     //Uses an if statement to either congradulate the student or tell the student to take more classes     if ((onProbation = true) || (canGraduate = false)){         System.out.println("You don't qualify to graduate.");     }     else{         System.out.println("Congradualations you qualify to graduate.");     }  } } </code></pre>
