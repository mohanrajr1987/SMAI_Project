<p>I have a problem with some code I am trying to right in c++, it's the average of 3 test scores and the cout will give you your average but then it needs a bool variable if the average is equal to 100% then true it will display a string of "Congrats you received a perfect" and if it's not 100% nothing will appear besides their average, but I keep getting the string of "Congrats" to come up even if the average is not 100% </p>  <pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt; using namespace std;  int main ()  { int score1, score2, score3;     cout &lt;&lt; "Enter your 3 test scores and I will \n";     cout &lt;&lt; "average them: ";     cin &gt;&gt; score1 &gt;&gt; score2 &gt;&gt; score3 ; double average;     average = (score1 + score2 + score3) / 3.0;     cout &lt;&lt; "Your average is " &lt;&lt; average &lt;&lt; endl;     bool perfectScore;     if(average = 100)         perfectScore = true;     else         perfectScore = false;     if(perfectScore == true)         cout &lt;&lt; "Congratulations! \n";         cout &lt;&lt; "That's a perfect score. \n";         cout &lt;&lt; "you deserve a pat on the back! \n";          return 0;  } </code></pre>
