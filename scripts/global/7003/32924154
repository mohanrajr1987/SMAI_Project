<p>I am trying to set a NSDate from components; the hour is the only thing that I need to actually set, the remainder is from current date.  This is my code:</p>  <pre><code>NSCalendar *gregorian = [[NSCalendar alloc] initWithCalendarIdentifier: NSCalendarIdentifierGregorian]; NSDateComponents *components = [[NSCalendar currentCalendar] components:NSCalendarUnitDay | NSCalendarUnitMonth | NSCalendarUnitYear fromDate:[NSDate date]];  //  put in date with start time int month = [components month]; int day = [components day]; int year = [components year];  [components setHour: startTime]; [components setMinute: 0]; [components setSecond: 0]; NSDate *startDate = [gregorian dateFromComponents: components]; </code></pre>  <p>This is the result from the console:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Printing description of components:          Calendar Year: 2015       Month: 10       Leap month: no       Day: 3       Hour: 1730       Minute: 0       Second: 0</p>      <p>Printing description of startDate:   2015-10-25 15:57:12 +0000</p> </blockquote>  <p>Notice that the month and time have changed from what was supplied.  My question is why did it change (for future reference) and what do I do to fix this?</p>
