<p>As I'm trying to pass a method in Objective C as a parameter by using the following approach:</p>  <pre><code>-(void)aMethod:(SEL)selector withTarget:(id)target{        [target performSelector:selector]; } </code></pre>  <p>I get the following warning:</p>  <pre><code>performSelector may cause a leak because its selector is unknown </code></pre>  <p>Since the warning suggests that ARC may not manage the object properly because the compiler cannot link the receiver with the selector (due to the dynamic assignment), is there a reason to worry about it? Or can this warning be safely ignored? </p>  <p>I am worried about possible memory leaks due to the inability of the ARC to release the object from the heap - are my worries justified? </p>  <p>If so, what are the alternatives in Objective C when passing a method as a parameter? </p>  <p><strong>Update</strong></p>  <p>The question <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7017281/performselector-may-cause-a-leak-because-its-selector-is-unknown">performSelector may cause a leak because its selector is unknown</a> already responded to a similar concern, however the answer to the question does not explain alternatives to the approach, nor that having the dynamic declaration will cause memory leaks!</p>  <p>Thanks in advance! </p>
