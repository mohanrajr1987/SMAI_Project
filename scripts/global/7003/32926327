<p>In my chatting application, I have a ChatViewController.m that allows users to message with the QuickBlox framework.</p>  <p>When a user sends an image, a background upload begins and a UIProgressView displays the progress of the upload.</p>  <p>But what if the user backs out of that view during the upload, and returns in, say, 10 seconds while the upload is still happening. I want the UIProgressView to still be active and accurate based on that upload. But dismissing the ViewController doesn't allow me to do that.</p>  <p>Can someone suggest what I should be doing in this situation?</p>  <p><strong>EDIT:</strong> This is how I present the ChatViewController.m, depending on the chat selected from the CollectionView:</p>  <pre><code>- (void)prepareForSegue:(UIStoryboardSegue *)segue sender:(id)sender{     if([segue.destinationViewController isKindOfClass:ChatViewController.class]){          ChatViewController *destinationViewController = (ChatViewController *)segue.destinationViewController;          if(self.createdDialog != nil){             destinationViewController.dialog = self.createdDialog;             self.createdDialog = nil;         }else{              QBChatDialog *dialog = [ChatService shared].dialogs[((UICollectionViewCell *)sender).tag];              AppDelegate *appDelegate = (AppDelegate*)[[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate];             appDelegate.dialog = dialog;          }     } } </code></pre>  <p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong> I have implemented the ViewController as a singleton in my didSelectItemAtIndexPath. But now, the app presents only a black screen.</p>  <pre><code>- (void)collectionView:(UICollectionView *)collectionView didSelectItemAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath {          QBChatDialog *dialog = [ChatService shared].dialogs[indexPath.row];          ChatViewController *chatView = [[ChatViewController alloc] init];         chatView.dialog = dialog;         [self presentViewController:chatView animated:YES completion:nil];  } </code></pre>
