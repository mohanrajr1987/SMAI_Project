<p>So I am thinking about adding multiplayer to my game so recently I have done some research into what options I have. It seems that there are a lot of guides on how to incorporate "game centre" but from my research I couldn't find many alternatives. I found that there are ways to do with external libraries but if I can avoid using any libraries I would much prefer to do that</p>
