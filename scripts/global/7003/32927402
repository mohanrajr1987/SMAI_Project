<p>I have the need to show a different view controller for compact vs regular size classes. The difference in views is too great for the regular use case. My app used to just work based off of iPad Storyboard vs iPhone Storyboard. On an iPhone it shows some text, and on an iPad it shows a PDF. Would I have to do this in code, by creating a different container view controller, or are Size Classes not the tool for this?</p>
