<p>I just found 5 crash reports inside the xcode organizer. When I open them I get this stacktrace (marked area is the name of my app):</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/wGgrr.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/wGgrr.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>This error occurs on iOS8.4 as well as on iOS9, and on iPhone 5 and iPhone 6 devices likewise.</p>  <p>It is hard for me to track down because I cannot reproduce it neither on iPhone5(8.4) nor on iPhone6(9.0.1).</p>  <p>1./2. somewhere here:</p>  <pre><code>override func onButtonTableViewCellClick(button: BfPaperButton) {} </code></pre>  <p>3.</p>  <pre><code>var button: BfPaperButton = BfPaperButton.newAutoLayoutView()  func onClick() {     delegate?.onButtonTableViewCellClick(button) // 3 } </code></pre>  <p>I use swift 2, xcode 7 and iOS9. Help me to understand the error. What does the first line with the red image mean? Why has this error something to do with <code>Swift.String</code> at all??</p>  <p>I found this thread: <a href="https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/6078" rel="nofollow">https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/6078</a> where I extracted this information:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>One case I've seen of this kind of crash is when an Obj-C-based object   calls a delegate method that's Swift-based, and a parameter value is   nil but the Swift method signature isn't an optional type.   In the   case I saw, it was an error in the bridged delegate method signature â€”   it was actually supposed to be optional.   It could be something   similar in your case (the Swift definition doesn't allow for an   optional when it should), or it could be a bug in the Obj-C code   (producing nil when it shouldn't).</p> </blockquote>  <p>I use a obj-c lib called BfPaperButton which creates a Button that looks like in android material design. Maybe the error is related to this library?</p>  <p>Log:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5aQ8m.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5aQ8m.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>View image: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5aQ8m.png" rel="nofollow">http://i.stack.imgur.com/5aQ8m.png</a></p>  <p>I have two string extensions. One for length and one for substring:</p>  <pre><code>extension String {      var length: Int { return self.characters.count }      subscript (i: Int) -&gt; String {         return String(Array(self.characters)[i])     }      subscript (r: Range&lt;Int&gt;) -&gt; String {         let start = startIndex.advancedBy(r.startIndex)         let end = startIndex.advancedBy(r.endIndex)         return substringWithRange(Range(start: start, end: end))     } } </code></pre>  <p>Line 188 is:</p>  <pre><code>NSUUID().UUIDString[0...4] </code></pre>  <p>which uses substring extension. Maybe the error is here?</p>
