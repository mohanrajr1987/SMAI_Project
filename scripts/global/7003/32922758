<p>I want to have a couple of buttons in my iOS app at the bottom of the screen and so used a UIToolBar and added a couple of Bar Button Items to it. But I realized that these BarButtonItems are not considered to be regular buttons. So I am not able to set actions on mouse up on these. Is there a way to set a function to be called when these buttons are clicked? If this is not possible through the storyboard, can I access it programmatically? </p>
