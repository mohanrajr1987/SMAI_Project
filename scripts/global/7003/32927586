<p>Previously, before WatchOS 2 it was very hard for your apple watch and iPhone to communicate but with WatchOS 2 and the new <code>Watch Connectivity</code>framework it seems to have improved a lot.</p>  <p>What I am wondering is that with this new framework, is there an easy way for me to run a function on the parent app on the iPhone by clicking a button on the apple watch. Before you would have to use wormhole and it was very confusing.</p>  <p>Basically all I want is to press a button on my watch, and it'll run a line of code on my iPhone!</p>  <p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>
