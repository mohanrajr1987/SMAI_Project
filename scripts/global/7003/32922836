<p>I'm building my first application, in which I have a custom <code>NSView</code> which is used for dragging and dropping files. I've got the registration of the dragging operation down, but still need to design the drag and drop area, so the users actually know that they can drop files on there.  </p>  <p><em>I'd like the area to look something like this:</em><br> <a href="https://i.imgur.com/BqbNsfw.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/BqbNsfw.png" alt="How do I get my drag and drop area to look like this?"></a>  </p>  <p>I've tried some different things out in the <code>drawRect</code> function of my custom <code>NSView</code> class, but so far I haven't been able to even draw a <em>dashed</em> border.  </p>  <p>Is it possible to draw something like this inside a <code>NSView</code>, and if so: how do I do it? Or should I just create a image of how I'd like my drag and drop area to look, and insert this into the view?<br> Thanks in advance.</p>
