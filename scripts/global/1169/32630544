<p>While working and developing user controls in Asp.Net, There are basically three kinds of such a project:</p>  <p>1.) User Control as a Class Library</p>  <p>2.) User Control as a class file</p>  <p>3.) the common .ASCX way </p>  <p>Can you please share what are the advantage/disadvantages of each project type and which one should I be using ? </p>  <p>What are the points to consider when selecting a particular project type ? I have read a lot on this but still confused. Can you please provide more specific example such as where exactly will I use .ASCX control or any other ?</p>
