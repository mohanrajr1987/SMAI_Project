<p>I try to design a button list control for compact framework by using c#. I want it to work as a list control but I don't derive it from winform list control. Buttons will be pictureboxes. The pictureboxes one below another will be seen as a list. When the first picture box item is clicked, the list will expand if not expanded, the list will collapse if expanded. I do that expanding and collapsing by changing the pictureboxes' properties.</p>  <p>The control works well when I put it on a form. But the button list control will be used in another user control, namely inputcontrol. The inputcontrol will wrap a label, a textbox and my button list control. When I put the button list on the user control, the button list does not expand because pictureboxes' Y location goes beyond the height of the inputcontrol. </p>  <p>I want those picture boxes to be repainted as list items of the standard listbox.</p>
