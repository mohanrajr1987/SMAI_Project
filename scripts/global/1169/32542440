<p>I created a user control <code>.ascx</code> and added it in master page by dragging and drop so that registering and everything is done by automatically.i can see that usercontrol contains Menu in design time ,but when i run it i am not seeing it in UI. Strange i checked page inspector console tab ,but no error throwing  only thing it showing is local site you have added it in compatibility view and <code>HTML1527: DOCTYPE expected. The shortest valid doctype is “&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;”</code>.I am doing HTML 5 conversion also for this website which was in previous version ,but not complete.Can anybody tell me why this behavior </p>
