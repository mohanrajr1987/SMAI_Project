<p>I'm trying to create simple custom command (added in TOOLS menu option) to open the tool bar with custom control in VS 2013 using VS Package project.</p>  <p>I'm following <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb165987.aspx" rel="nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb165987.aspx</a> this guide but not sure why it's not working. </p>  <p>When I click on it, it opens tool window but without content under it. I want to show the MyControl.cs or custom control content under it.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/E3iLH.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/E3iLH.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I've tried a lot to find it out on Google but no relevent article found for same.</p>  <p>I've notice when I created new VS Package, it created "MyControl.xaml" file which loading it's data properly. I deleted that file and created new user control "MyControl.cs" which is not loading data.</p>  <p>Not sure if it requires VSIX project or VS Package. Is there any other way to do this?</p>
