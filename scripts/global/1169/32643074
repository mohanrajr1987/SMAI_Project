<p>I create a custom User Control which inherits from DataGridViewColumn.</p>  <p>Moreover, I added some properties in the control, but I can't modify them in design-time.</p>  <p>Even I set the default value as true, it's still false.</p>  <p>code:</p>  <pre><code>public class ParaGridViewColumn : DataGridViewColumn {                     private bool _Necessary;     private bool _ReadOnlyEmpty;      [Description("Default cell status."), Category("Behavior"), DefaultValue(false)]     public bool Necessary { get { return _Necessary; } set { _Necessary = value;} }                             [Description("When ReadOnly is true, clear value on the cell or not."), Category("Behavior"), DefaultValue(true)]     public bool ReadOnlyEmpty { get { return _ReadOnlyEmpty; } set { _ReadOnlyEmpty = value; }}              public ParaGridViewColumn()     {         this.CellTemplate = new ParaGridViewCell();     } } </code></pre>  <p>The new properties can shown on the window, but their default value are false.</p>  <p>I change them to true, entering and opening this window again, it's still false.</p>  <p>However, I can modify other properties regularly. It means I didn't lock this control. <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ab6pb.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ab6pb.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Why is that? Did I make something wrong?</p>  <p>Thanks a lot.</p>
