<p>I have a program which is written in VB6 and runs in many PCs with different windows versions, without any problem.</p>  <p>But in some PCs it does give me the error:</p>  <pre><code>failed to activate control 'vb.usercontrol'. this control may be incompatible with your application </code></pre>  <p>I register OCX files which are needed by my program.</p>  <p>I don't know if it's related to being a <em>32bit</em> or <em>64bit</em> OS or not.</p>  <p>I'll be happy to know your answers. Thanks.</p>
