<p>In a program I wrote, I came up with functionality for a User Control, so I decided to break it out into its own project/DLL. The control consists of two buttons and a panel.  When I use the DLL, however, I am missing a critical piece of functionality - I can no longer change the <code>AutoScrollPosition</code> of the panel! My hunch is that I'm getting a copy, not a reference to the property when I go to set it... So here's an idea of the code:</p>  <pre><code>// this works when the user control is native to my project panelContainer.AutoScrollPosition = new Point(0, myVal + 1);  // this doesn't work when the user control is Referenced in my project     FromDLL.panelContainer.AutoScrollPosition = new Point(0, myVal + 1); </code></pre>  <p>I can change other properties on the <code>FromDll.panelContainer</code>, such as the name, but I can't change AutoScrollPosition.  Other properties between the two are exactly the same (<code>AutoScroll = false</code>, etc...).  To top it off, when I create Setter method in the DLL, the calls work:</p>  <pre><code>// Call from project to set DLL's reference to native panel FromDLL.SetMainPanel(nativePanel);  // Now this works after the call to SetMainPanel FromDLL.panelContainer.AutoScrollPosition = new Point(0, myVal + 1); </code></pre>  <p>Any ideas on why I'd be getting a copy of the AutoScrollPosition instead of a reference?</p>
