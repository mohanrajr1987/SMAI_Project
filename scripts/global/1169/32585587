<p>Is it possible to create a single user control out of it?<br> I mean so I can just drag it out of the toolbox inside my designer?</p>  <p><strong>My goal:</strong> Im trying to get a modular architecture for my tool. Therefore quite everything is splitted into user controls. But one there is one user control which uses another user control at runtime. I would like to stick them together.</p>  <p>Maybe creating a dll? Google wasnt any help so far.<br> The only alternative way I can imagine is creating the second user control at runtime inside the first one. But that would be a mess of work.. also I couldnt use the designer for the second one this way.</p>  <hr>  <p>Im not a big fan of non-code-questions but I guess theres nothing to post in here.</p>  <p><em>Winforms / 4.5.1</em></p>
