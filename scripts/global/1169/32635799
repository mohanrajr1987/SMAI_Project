<p>I have a WinForms user control when I have hidden Control.Click using</p>  <pre><code>public new event EventHandler Click {     add     {         base.Click += value;         foreach (Control control in Controls)         {             control.Click += value;         }     }     ... } </code></pre>  <p>(see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9677062/user-control-click-event-not-working-when-clicking-on-text-inside-control">this question</a>).  This works well and all is fine and dandy, <em>until</em> I cast it to a generic <code>Control</code> (for example when passing a reference to something that knows nothing about the specific user control type).</p>  <p>In this case, when adding a click handler it is bound to the base Control_Click, completely bypassing the above method that was supposed to hide the base method.  Any suggestions?</p>
