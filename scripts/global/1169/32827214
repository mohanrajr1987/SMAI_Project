<p>I want to create a control like Gradient Slider in Visual Studio. One interesting thing of it: A new thumb is added after mouse click. I have found a solution like this <a href="https://yagnagradientcontrol.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">https://yagnagradientcontrol.codeplex.com/</a> However, its not a slider. It's a canvas with border and very inelegant. Perhaps, there is more elegant solution. I know how to add a new thumb in XAML, but we don't the emount. So, we need to add it in C# and I have no idea how to implement it.</p>  <p>I'll appreciate any help. Thanks in advance.</p>
