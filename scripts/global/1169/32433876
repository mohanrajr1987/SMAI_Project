<p>I'm currently using Prism+Unity in my WPF application.</p>  <p>I've a question: I've a UserControl that is instantiated inside some View:</p>  <pre><code>//[...] &lt;Wizard&gt;    &lt;WizardPage/&gt; &lt;/Wizard&gt; //[...] </code></pre>  <p>Inside my Wizard class, I need to get my <code>IDialogService</code> implementation. This service has been registered but I don't know how to retrieve this implementation inside of my UserControl.</p>  <p>How do I ask Unity to get the correct implementation inside an UserControl?</p>  <p>I tried:</p>  <ul> <li>Put a IUnityContainer(or IDialogService) parameter in the constructor, but this object is not instantiatedby Unity, and WPF wants to have an empty constructor for object instantiated inside the XAML</li> <li>Put a <code>[Dependency]</code> attribute on my <code>IDialogService</code>(but since the object is not instantiated, by Unity, this is not called</li> <li>Put everything in a ViewModel dedicated to the UserControl, but I also have to be able to instantiate it with Unity, and it's the same issue</li> </ul>  <p>Any advice? Should I put a Singleton somewhere to get an UnityContainer?</p>
