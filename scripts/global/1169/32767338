<p>I have a usercontrol with grid as content panel, which loads its content from datatemplate, specified in xaml where usercontrol is used.</p>  <p>I am using this usercontrol widely and everything is fine with standard xaml controls in template. now I am trying to show some charts in this control with OxyPlot</p>  <pre><code>   &lt;DataTemplate x:Key="SomeChart"&gt;         &lt;Grid x:Name="oxyGrid" &gt;             &lt;oxy:PlotView x:Name="oxyChart" Model="{Binding model}" /&gt;         &lt;/Grid&gt;     &lt;/DataTemplate&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I initialize data model for the chart in usercontrol_loaded but the chart will not be shown until I manually call InvalidateMeasure for it. if I call invalidatemeasure from usercontrol_loaded , it will not help.</p>  <p>if I call invalidatemeasure from any point when chart is on the screen - it helps and chart will shows up.</p>  <p>currently, I found that I can call invalidatemeasure in usercontrol_layoutupdated handler but don't like as it fires too often and requires code outside of usercontrol.</p>  <p>if I try to handle event layoutupdated inside usercontrol and call invalidatemeasure (for oxychart) from there, I am getting "Layout cycle detected.  Layout could not complete."</p>  <p>any ideas about what's wrong and how to fix :) will be greatly appreciated thanks in advance ilya</p>
