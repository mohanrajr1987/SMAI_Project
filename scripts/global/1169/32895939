<p>I am having what I believe is a permissions issue.</p>  <p>I have a user that has Windows 7 Home Edition and I need her to be able to access a folder that is controlled by the Domain, even though I cannot put her on the domain.</p>  <p>I have tried mapping the network drive using alternative credentials and even though she can gain access, she cannot add a new folder, which is truly the most important task to her.</p>  <p>I spoke to a friend of mine and he had me try to do:</p>  <pre><code>net use T: \\EWS\MPC_DB$\quotes /user:mpc\administrator Password </code></pre>  <p>and I kept getting a 'System Error 1219'</p>  <p>So I tried:</p>  <pre><code>net use T: \\192.168.1.54\MPC_DB$\quotes /user:mpc\administrator Password </code></pre>  <p>and viola, it appeared in her mapped network directory, however upon accessing the folder and trying to create a new folder she was met with an error message stating she did not have sufficient privileges.</p>  <p>I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that mpc\administrator has the necessary privileges to execute this action, but I am at a loss with how to get this task complete.</p>
