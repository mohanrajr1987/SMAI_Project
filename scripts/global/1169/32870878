<p>I have a user control that I created with certain buttons, and I placed it within the main form, which already contains things like buttons and panels. I want to control(send messages) to these fields when I press the buttons in the user control, but I can't figure out the OOP implementation required to achieve this. </p>  <p>I was advised to create an Initialize(f as Mainform) in the user control code in order to keep an explicit reference to the main form, but I have not been able to control the fields of the main form.</p>  <p>How can this be achieved? I am using visual basic, btw.</p>
