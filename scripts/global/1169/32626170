<p>I have a UserControl hat contains several elements (ListBoxes, Buttons) and a Popup with ComboBoxes and Buttons.</p>  <p>I tried lost focus on the user contorl, but whenever the focus inside the UserControl changes, the Lost(Keyboard)Focus event fires.</p>  <p>But I don't want to know when a child loses focus to another child of the UserControl, but I want to know, when the keyboard focus moves to an element outside the UserControl and it's Popup.</p>  <p>Is there a way to detect that, without checking the LostFocus of every single element?</p>
