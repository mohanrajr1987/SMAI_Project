<p>I have a panel in a winforms application and I'm wondering if it is possible to see if there is UserControl at a coordinate, for example x:200, y:200.</p>  <p>I don't just want to detect UserControls with their top-left at x:200, y:200 but also to detect a UserControl if say, it was at x:150, y:150 with W:100, H:100.</p>  <p>I've given it a quick google but I can't find anything.</p>  <p>[edit] To sum up:</p>  <p>In the <strong>Black</strong> Panel I would like to be able to detect if there is a UserControl (shown in  <strong>Red</strong>) at the <strong>Blue</strong> coordinate as shown in image 2 not just image 1.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Pz4Bp.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Pz4Bp.png" alt="enter image description here"></a> <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/bD24r.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/bD24r.png" alt="Image 2"></a></p>
