<p>I have a scenario where , I have user control file <strong>abc.ascx</strong> that has a dropdownlist, whose ListItems values are also usercontrol files <strong>a.ascx</strong>,<strong>b.ascx</strong>,<strong>c.ascx</strong>. When <em>b.ascx</em> is selected in the dropdownlist present in <em>abc.ascx</em> , a GridView is populated within <em>b.ascx</em> and is displayed in a place-holder on <em>abc.ascx</em> Is it possible to access the populated gridview of <em>b.ascx</em> in <em>abc.ascx</em> through the place holder ? If so, how ?</p>
