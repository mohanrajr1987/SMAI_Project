<p>I am trying to embed an auto generated file into my library. The auto generated file is placed in <code>($OutDir)</code>. Now I am having hard time referencing it in the <code>*.rc</code> file:</p>  <pre><code>MY_FILE RCDATA DISCARDABLE "(SomethingShouldGoHere)\myfile.xml" </code></pre>  <p>I hoped that msbuild would somehow pass the OutDir variable when including .rc file but couldn't find the right syntax. I tried using AdditionalIncludeDirectories tag but also without luck.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;ResourceCompile Include="Resource.rc"&gt;       &lt;AdditionalIncludeDirectories&gt;($OutDir)&lt;/AdditionalIncludeDirectories&gt; &lt;/ResourceCompile&gt; </code></pre>
