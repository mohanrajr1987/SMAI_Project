<p>I have been having a bit of trouble getting Build on TFS 2013 to work when using Visual Studio 2015 for the checking in of files. The solution/project that I am working on was created on VS 2015 (.NET 4.6) and I seem to be having troubles building it on my TFS 2013.</p>  <p>I was firstly getting an error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Confirm that the path in the  declaration is correct, and that   the file exists on disk</p> </blockquote>  <p>But I seem to have overcome this by adding:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>/p:VisualStudioVersion=14.0</p> </blockquote>  <p>against the MSBuild Agent. That overcome I then try to build a check in (from VS 2015) and I now get the error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>TF900547: The directory containing the assemblies for the Visual   Studio Test Runner is not valid 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft   Visual Studio 12.0\Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\Microsoft\TestWindow'.</p> </blockquote>  <p>This is suggesting that there is still a reference to the older version of VS for the TestWindow (i.e. 12.0) instead of looking in the folder</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Visual Studio 14.0</p> </blockquote>  <p>Which is where I would want it to point.</p>  <p>I have Visual Studio 2015 installed on the same machine as TFS  so everything is there - but in the respective 14.0 folders where TFS keeps going to look in 12.0</p>  <p>Am I missing an obvious trick with regards to how I have all this setup or do I just keep having to plug at these issues as they come up?</p>  <p>Obviously I would like to get TFS 2015 setup to use alongside VS 2015 developments but that is a little wile off yet.</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
