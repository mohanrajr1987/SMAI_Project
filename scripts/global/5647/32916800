<p>I'm trying to package my python code with PBR (Python Build Reasonableness). It generates the requirements metadata for you through a set of conventions.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The requirement files are tried in that order (N being the Python major version number used to install the package):</p>      <p>requirements-pyN.txt</p>      <p>tools/pip-requires-py3</p>      <p>requirements.txt</p>      <p>tools/pip-requires</p> </blockquote>  <p>In my directory, I need to have a <code>requirements.txt</code> for another convention where it's needed for a Docker container that has a different set of requirements than my published target. I want to keep both the Docker image generation and the python package building in this project because they have common files.</p>  <p>How could I specify a requirement such as <code>requirements-pbr.txt</code> and override the fact that PBR will pull in <code>requirements.txt</code>?</p>
