<p>I am pretty new to Travis CI and integrating that with Github to build my code. I did a few trial and errors and have my Gradle plugin successfully built by Travis now. Thanks to the documentation and the help out here and everywhere.</p>  <p>Now I am tryin to build another project which needs some product to be installed for the build to even work. This is not a dependency jar but a dependency package (Oracle Commerce - ATG in my case). I managed to create a docker image with ATG installed and did the following in my travis.yml to test the build using Travis. Is this the best approach ? Or do you have any better suggestions? Please help</p>  <pre><code>sudo: required  language: bash  services:   - docker  install:   - docker pull asnagaraj/oracle-atg-11.1:v4  script:   - docker run -v $TRAVIS_BUILD_DIR:/workspace/test-atg-module asnagaraj/oracle-atg-11.1:v4 /bin/bash -c ". ~/.bash_profile; cd /workspace/test-atg-module; gradle --stacktrace gATGM" </code></pre>  <p>FYI - the build passed with this approach.</p>  <p>-Naga</p>
