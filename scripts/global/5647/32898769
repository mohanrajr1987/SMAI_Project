<p>I'm using PhoneGap Build to convert my HTML5/JS app into an iOS and Android application, but I want to modify the config.xml to add icons and what not. However all I have in the .zip that I use to create the build is:</p>  <p>-functions.js</p>  <p>-index.html</p>  <p>-style.css</p>  <p>Should I create a config.xml and put it on that root directory on my zip? How can I use the config file?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
