<p>I had a working project. I tweaked my code (with some minor, trivial stuff that shouldn't break anything) and committed my changes. Since then I get this warning: </p>  <pre><code>warning: Ambiguous Content: The launch image set "LaunchImage" has 9 unassigned children. </code></pre>  <p>In addition, my project build's in the wrong resolution. On the iPhone 6 no longer fits the full screen:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Fz4TO.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Fz4TO.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>It seems that my build got corrupted after I've committed. (This is the first time I did it.)</p>  <p>Can you please help? I already tried a deep clean by pressing Command-Alt-Shift-k.</p>
