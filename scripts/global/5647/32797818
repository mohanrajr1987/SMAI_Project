<p>I would like to use pyudt, but I don't manage to build it from source.. I already checked the old and only similar question related to pyudt here and the answers given didn't help. I still get errors when compiling. Also, I don't really know how the wrapping is done in python, like - it's using the C++ lib right? So until I figure this stuff out I probably won't be able to compile this thing properly.</p>  <p>If someone has an already built py/pyc file I'd be really glad to get it. Thanks for the help.</p>
