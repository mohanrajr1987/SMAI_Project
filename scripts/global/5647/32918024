<p>I am new to C# and I am in my first Hello World program... it runs fine in VS2015 Community Edition (Win 7).  Now, I want to generate an .exe file for my project, but when I click Build ﻿be it in Release or in Debug﻿ I get the message Build Succeeded but I cannot find the .exe file for my project.  I am searching in the same directory where my project resides: I can see the "source" subdirectory and the "artifacts" subdirectory; but cannot see an "release" or nor an  "debug" or  nor an "bin" subdirectories.</p>  <p>Thank you!</p>
