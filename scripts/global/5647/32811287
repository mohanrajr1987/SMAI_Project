<p>Should we all aim to have reproducible builds with identical binaries? Is this even possible in practice?</p>  <p>As a normal build process may include few layers or encapsulation of files with timestamps from the build time it does require a lot of effort in order to attempt to create identical build artefacts between two different executions of the same code, probably even on identical machines.</p>  <p>I would like to know if the goal of making binary identical builds is even archivable in real life.</p>  <p>While it does not seem very hard to try to change the timestamp of all generated files to the timestamp of the last commit, i do suspect that it may be very hard to deal with processed where signing is involved (assuming that the signature was not revoked between the two builds).</p>  <p>It seems that <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds" rel="nofollow">debian has quite a good track on this</a>. How about Windows builds?</p>
