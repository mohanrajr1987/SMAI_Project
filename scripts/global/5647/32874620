<p>I'm having issues since switching to solely TFS 2015 w/ VS 2015 that the logs no longer have the details of the Deployment Task. They are still visible if I go back to a 2013 visual studio and view them in VS instead of online. However I would like to continue using the new tools provided.</p>  <p>[IN WEB UI]</p>  <pre><code>Deploy Build on Environment  Deploying Build   Run Deployment scripts    Run Deployment Task     Run Deployment Task      Deployment Task Logs for Machine: machine01   Release Environment From Deployment </code></pre>  <hr>  <p>[IN VS 2013 UI]</p>  <pre><code>Deploy Build on Environment  Deploying Build   Run Deployment scripts    Run Deployment Task     Run Deployment TaskDeployment Task Logs for Machine: XXXXX      Accessing the following location using the lab service account: XX\XXXX, \\XXXXXX\builds.
