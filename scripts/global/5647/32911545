<p>I had this problem before, but don't remember how I solved it. I have some FXML files in my resources folder, and it is marked as a resource folder. The resources are copied to the build directory (not under classes, but resources). The problem is that the resources are not copied to the jar when built.</p>  <p>I tried adding the resources folder to the jar manually in the artifact config, but that didn't work.</p>
