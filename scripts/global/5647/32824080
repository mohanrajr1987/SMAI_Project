<p>At trying to run a test application i obtain the following error twice:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>There was a mismatch between the processor architecture of the project being built "MSIL" and the processor architecture of the reference "C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\mscorlib.dll", "x86".</p>      <p>This mismatch may cause runtime failures. Please consider changing the targeted processor architecture of your project through the Configuration Manager so as to align the processor architectures between your project and references, or take a dependency on references with a processor architecture that matches the targeted processor architecture of your project. TestMobile.Core   mismatch MSIL x86</p> </blockquote>  <p>I have .NET Framework installed, as well as windows 8 SDK tools and using MultilingualAppToolKit.</p>  <p>I already have verified the configuration manager and everything seems to be fine. Platform target, targeting "Any CPU"</p>
