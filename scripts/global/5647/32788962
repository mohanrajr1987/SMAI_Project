<p>Sorry this isn't a direct code question.  If there's a better place to ask this, please let me know.</p>  <p>I'm looking for some insight/advice from some experienced people in the software industry.  At my current job, I am split between Build/Release Engineer and Software Engineer roles.  It used to be an even split, but has moved to probably 80/20.  Most of my time is spent on Build tasks.<br> My eventual goal is to be an Architect and (stretch goal) CTO.  Does anyone know if the path I am on leads to one of those roles?  I'm really conflicted at the moment, since I really enjoy coding, and I really enjoy making development processes more efficient.</p>
