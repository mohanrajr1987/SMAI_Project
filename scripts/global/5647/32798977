<p>I am having trouble running a compiled build containing pyproj. I have used pyinstaller to compile and keep running into the 'cannot import name error' at runtime. This is a similar type of error to what I've reported <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32760048/pyinstaller-with-pil-importerror-cannot-import-name-imaging?noredirect=1#comment53409215_32760048">here</a> regarding PIL. Specifically with regards to naming conventions and the type of error.</p>  <p>A similar qustion has been asked <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20201532/issues-with-pyinstaller-and-pyproj">here</a> although I didn't find their suggestion fixed the error in my case. </p>  <p>I've added in the _proj.pyd as a binary to the build folder and referenced in the spec file but to no avail.</p>  <p>Incidentally, can anyone explain what is the deal with certain modules being called by the underscore naming convention rather than the capital? In this instance, _proj rather than Proj. These types of modules also usually only contain a .pyd and not a .py in their module folder, resulting in the compiler getting confused when compiling to executables. Noticing a similar pattern with problem modules and don't really understand it.</p>  <pre><code>import _socket # dynamically loaded from C:\Users\Hp\AppData\Local\Temp\_MEI53882\_socket.pyd import parser # builtin import win32api # dynamically loaded from C:\Users\Hp\AppData\Local\Temp\_MEI53882\win32api.pyd import pywintypes # dynamically loaded from C:\Users\Hp\AppData\Local\Temp\_MEI53882\pywintypes27.dll import pythoncom # dynamically loaded from C:\Users\Hp\AppData\Local\Temp\_MEI53882\pythoncom27.dll Traceback (most recent call last):   File "&lt;string&gt;", line 50, in &lt;module&gt;   File "C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\PyInstaller\loader\pyi_importers.py", line 270, in load_module     exec(bytecode, module.__dict__)   File "C:\Users\Hp\PycharmProjects\GISdev\build\gis_helper2\out00-PYZ.pyz\pyproj", line 50, in &lt;module&gt; ImportError: cannot import name _proj </code></pre>
