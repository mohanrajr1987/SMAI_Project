<p>I have downloaded the library libpng - a c library. My task is to make some changes to this library. I have opened the library using code blocks. There is a test program <code>pngtest.c</code> which takes an image file as an input, through which the library functions are tested. This function comes with the library itself.</p>  <p>My question is I am not able to execute the <code>pngtest.c</code> program. I am getting "It seems that this program has not been build yet". I have build the library as well.</p>  <p>I am not sure where is the mistake.</p>
