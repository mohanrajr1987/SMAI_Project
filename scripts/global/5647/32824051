<p>I'm trying to publish an asp.net project to my local file system.  This had been working in the past but now I'm experiencing the following issue.</p>  <p>The project level dll is not created in the bin folder as it normally is for all my other projects.  Instead, all of my source code behind files are now included in the project folder.</p>  <p>Any help I can get on this one will be greatly appreciated.</p>  <p>Thanks, Tim</p>
