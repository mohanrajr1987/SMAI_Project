<p>I've developed a Team Foundation Server 2015 plugin implementing <code>Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Framework.Server.ISubscriber</code> interface from <code>Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Framework.Server</code> assembly.</p>  <p>I would like to provide some configuration to the plugin, but I want it in the Team Foundation Server UI. </p>  <p>Actually, I've developed some plugin to trigger a build under some special condition, and it would be wonderful if I could configure some parameters in the <em>Triggers</em> tab on new scriptable build definitions (see the following picture)</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/jj2Ff.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/jj2Ff.png" alt="TFS 2015 new build definition system settings"></a></p>  <p>Is it possible to add some new UI section to <em>Triggers</em> or, at least, an entire new tab there?</p>  <p><em>My alternative would be instructing the user to add some variables to <strong>Variables</strong> tab...</em></p>
