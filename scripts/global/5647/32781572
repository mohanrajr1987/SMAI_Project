<p>I use the <a href="http://crashlytics.com/" rel="nofollow">Crashlytics</a> framework for crash collecting in iOS Apps. </p>  <p>When you use the framework, a "Build Phase" is added to your target that runs <code>/Fabric/Fabric.framework/run &lt;big-hex-blob&gt; &lt;another-even-biger-hex-blob&gt;</code>. </p>  <p>I'd love to know that these actually do â€“ I'm not entirely happy with having external vendors' tools monkey about with my build, I'm old school like that.</p>
