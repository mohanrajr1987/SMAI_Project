<p>I'm building a Google Apps Script Add-On and wanted to know whether anyone can access the underlying source code when I publish it to the Marketplace?  I want to store a password/private key in the code and wanted to make sure no one who installs the app can access it.</p>  <p>Using a Google Apps Script Library allows a user to use their own script to step into the source code, so that's an example of a public library whose source code is visible to the end user.</p>  <p>Failing that, is there a better solution for storing a password/private key?</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
