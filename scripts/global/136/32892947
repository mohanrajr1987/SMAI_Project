<p>I use on my server a Text-to-Speech Synthesis platform (probably written in Java).</p>  <p>While the above application is running on my server, users can get audio as a URL to a wav file using the embedded HTML <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> tag, as follows:</p>  <p><code>&lt;audio controls&gt;    &lt;source src=”http://myserver.com:59125/process?INPUT_TEXT=Hello%20world” type=”audio/wav”&gt; &lt;/audio&gt;</code>  </p>  <p>In the above ‘<em>src</em>’ attribute, ‘<em>process</em>’ requests the synthesis of some text using local port 59125.</p>  <p>My concern is that I might start seeing performance issues and out of memory errors, which would cause the TTS Synthesis platform server (but not the website) to crash every few days, apparently triggered by one or more entities abusing it as some sort of webservice for their own applications.</p>  <p>I wish to secure the URL requests so that a third party couldn't use my text-to-speech server for audio clips not related to my website.</p>  <p>How to secure the URL service?</p>
