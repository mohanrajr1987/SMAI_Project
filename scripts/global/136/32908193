<p>I have a JNLP app that runs successfully when it references our internal production server. When I attempt to run pointing to our internal test server or my local machine it gets blocked with the Java Security error. Other details and attempted resolutions:</p>  <ul> <li>One difference between prod &amp; non-prod is the port is specified in the URL. </li> <li>I edited the site exception list, with fully qualified and wildcard (/) paths, without success. (The production URL isn't listed). </li> <li>Java is configured for High security (the lowest setting) and there's no Deployment Ruleset for our site.</li> <li>I tried javaws -verbose but received no meaningful information</li> <li>I enabled Java tracing and logging, but there's only minimal messaging</li> <li>Turned on the Java console, but it doesn't display in the case of the failures</li> <li>App is signed with a current certificate</li> <li>filesize parameter in JNLP has been updated</li> </ul>  <p>I tried all the advice in this post without making any progress: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20967995/java-jnlp-application-blocked-by-security-settings">Java jnlp application blocked by Security settings</a>. Ideas anyone?</p>
