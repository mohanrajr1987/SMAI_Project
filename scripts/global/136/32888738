<p>I am working on a app that has a feature like that: that once installed linked to a email account. And if you want to use any features of app then a mail will be sent to mail account and then if permission is granted you can use features of mobile and then only you can uninstall the application. i referred a tutorial <a href="https://newcircle.com/s/post/1291/android_device_policy_administration_tutorial" rel="nofollow">android</a> but not get satisfied. please suggest any tutorial or android code for setting permissions. Thanks</p>
