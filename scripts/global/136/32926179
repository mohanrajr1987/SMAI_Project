<p>Before publishing my work over the internet, I am here to ask you a debrief if what I built is sufficiently secure as accepted practice.</p>  <p>My client query a db by ID of items; then it passes the ID over the url to a second page. So you will have something like:</p>  <pre><code> mypage.com/pagename?q=#numericID </code></pre>  <p>The <code>#numericID</code> is the ID of an item.  I wonder if the site is secure enough against crawling if the API are allowed under the same domain only, or if I should follow another practice more orthodox: cookies? re-factor the app as single page instead of two-pages - first for query, second for results? ...?</p>  <p>Please advice also how to re-frame my question, cause security about servers is completely a new thing to me and I don't know exactly what topic I should look at.</p>
