<p>I've worked with a number of different hashing algorithms in the past and I was under the impression that they were all deterministic.</p>  <p>I just switched some of my code to use BCrypt.Net and I have to admit I was completely stumped when all of my comparison tests failed. </p>  <p>After looking for errors in my test for an embarrassing amount of time I realized that my assumption that the hashes are deterministic was completely incorrect. There is a verify method which works and it was easy enough to fix the code but I'd like to understand what is going on a little bit better.</p>  <p>Is it salting the values internally or is something else going on?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/9Za65.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/9Za65.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <ul> <li><em>Please note I am salting this in my real code - this is just a test</em></li> </ul>
