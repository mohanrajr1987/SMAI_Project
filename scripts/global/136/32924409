<p>The socket server doesn't handle any logins or any inputs from the user, it just delivers information TO the user from a mysql database when it becomes available. Having not worked with socket.io before I don't know what things I should look out for when developing with it. For example can someone access the contents of the .js "server"? Because mine contains some sensitive data like sql credentials.</p>
