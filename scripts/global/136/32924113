<p>I have a controller called Account and an action called AddFunds()</p>  <p>In my <strong>HttpGet Addfunds()</strong> action I return the view bind to a ViewModel with a AccountId property, so by default the view contains a hidden field called AccountId.</p>  <p>In the <strong>HttpPost AddFunds()</strong> action, I received the updated ViewModel, with the same AccountID as passed by the HttpGet method, with some other parameters, such as Amount, etc.</p>  <p>What can I do to prevent a person to invoke the method directly passing a fake AccountId?</p>  <p>Does the AntiForgery token prevent this? Any other measure should I take?</p>  <p>As a side question, does passing the AccountID in a hidden field can be avoided or is it necessary to know which entity I am acting upon?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
