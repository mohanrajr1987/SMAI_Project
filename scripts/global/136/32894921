<p>I have an Asp.Net - Web API configured to distribute Refresh tokens using OAuth and Owin. I want to call the API from my applications on the server side (they are not mobile). My idea is to retrieve the refresh token once the application starts (in a Startup class for example) and to store it somewhere on the server.</p>  <p><strong>Where is by standard a good place to store the Refresh tokens and the Client Secret?</strong>  Do I need to encrypt the refresh token or is it safe to store it clear text?</p>  <p>My current idea is simply to store the refresh tokens in a file and to store the access tokens in Session. </p>
