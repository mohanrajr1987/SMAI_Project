<p>I am using devise recoverable.  I read <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise#password-reset-tokens-and-rails-logs" rel="nofollow">this</a> section of the devise readme about security and leaked passwords.  I made the change as suggested in the production.rb file.  I don't fully understand the rest of it.  Is there anything else I need to do to make sure passwords aren't leaked.  I am not using any custom mailers just the default setup with devise.</p>
