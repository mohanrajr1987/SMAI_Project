<p>There are a couple insecurities in my app. One is the ability to type ruby commands into html forms. The commands are executed server side to produce the response. Another is to enter a URL into an html forms and display some unescaped content from that page.</p>  <p>Despite these insecurities, I'll be the only one using it, so I'm wondering if it's safe enough to just use basic http authentication by adding the following to application controller: </p>  <p><code>http_basic_authenticate_with :name =&gt; ENV["NAME"], :password =&gt; ENV["PASSWORD"]</code></p>  <p>I want to deploy to Heroku.</p>
