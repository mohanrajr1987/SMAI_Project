<p>I know that jar files (or class files) can be loaded remotely with URLClassLoader. But does this method provide any protection against piracy?</p>  <p>So lets say i have a jar file on the server, and on the client side, i can dynamically load the jar with URLClassLoader. But what about security? Is the jar file downloaded to a temp directory on the client? Can somebody have access to the contents of the jar file and decompile it?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance,</p>  <p>Onur</p>
