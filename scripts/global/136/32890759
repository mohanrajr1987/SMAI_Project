<p>No this is <strong>not</strong> a duplicate of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26040216/escaping-bash-variable">this</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7810591/escaping-bash-variables-for-regular-expression-containing-double-quote-parenthe">this</a>. I have a more specific problem.<br></p>  <h1>The situation</h1>  <p>I have a root bash daemon that makes symlinks of files in a directory. It gets the filename of every file and makes a symlink of it. The problem arises when web-users can upload files to a folder where the files in it needs to be symlinked (yes this needs to be done, don't post an answer like: "you shouldn't"). My concern is that users can get root privilege when they craft a filename in such a way that they can 'escape' the symlink command and execute code as root.<br></p>  <h1>My question</h1>  <p>Is it indeed possible to craft such a malicious payload in a filename (with limits of allowed characters in a linux file name system) to get root escalation?<br></p>
