<p>In iOS the keychain you access is already authenticated and unlocked for your application. It's a really easy way to store certain information in a separate part of your app.</p>  <p>I'd like to do this in my Mac application, where I have a keychain (maybe/probably not the login.keychain) which is configured to allow my Mac app access to read/write to it based on the app itself. </p>  <p>I know there is a method to do so that is linked to the compiled binary, but if you update you binary the user has to approve access to the keychain.</p>  <p>I need this to be something my application accesses without any user intervention at all. And preferably without having to keep a obfuscated password in my application.</p>
