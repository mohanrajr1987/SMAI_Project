<p>I am developing a web application using Python/Flask/SQLAlchemy on the server side.</p>  <p>I am using the <a href="http://www.wysihtml.com/" rel="nofollow">wysihtml</a> rich text editor to allow users to enter text with a very limited subset of HTML in it.  While wysihtml sanitizes the resulting HTML on the client side, some kind of server-side checking is required to ensure that only that subset of HTML is accepted.  To repeat, it not only should be valid HTML, I want it to only contain a very limited set of tags.  Furthermore, it doesn't have to be a complete HTML document.</p>  <p>Furthermore, I would like to know when non-compliant HTML is submitted, as it is either a bug in the client-side validation, or a (likely malicious) attempt to bypass it indicating an attack.  </p>  <p>I could use <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bleach" rel="nofollow">Bleach</a> to sanitize the user supplied HTML, but that does not work as a validator (there is no easy way to tell whether the sanitized HTML has been substantively changed) , and the developer has made clear that he regards validation as outside the scope of his tool.  </p>  <p>I have looked, but there doesn't appear to be a standard tool for doing validation in these circumstances.</p>  <p>I would prefer not to roll my own if I don't have to for two reasons: first, it will take extra time, and second, I don't want to run the risk of making rookie mistakes.</p>  <p>So can anybody point me to a standard method for doing this server-side in Python?  And, if not, why doesn't one exist?  Is the thinking behind my need for one misguided, and if so why?</p>
