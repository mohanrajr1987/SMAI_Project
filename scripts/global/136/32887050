<p>I am storing some files and also my core data sqlite store in the <code>Library Directory</code>. As far as i know it should be invisible to user but i can still see its content with tools like iFunBox and iExplorer. Is there a way to prevent this?</p>  <p>This is how i am storing my core data store and all the other files:</p>  <pre><code>- (NSURL *)applicationDocumentsDirectory {     return [[[NSFileManager defaultManager] URLsForDirectory:NSLibraryDirectory inDomains:NSUserDomainMask] lastObject]; } </code></pre>
