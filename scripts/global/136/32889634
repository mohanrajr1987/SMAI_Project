<p>I'm developing a single page booking application using angular which interacts with my REST API.</p>  <p>I have various routes defined in my application and I'm using local storage to store the state of each page as a user fills in their information. Once the user has filled in everything, I post this to my API, generate a hash and redirect them to a payment gateway before coming back to a results page. The reason for local storage is so we can persist a users filled in details, even if they close the page and re-open it.</p>  <p>I shouldn't store sensitive information such as user names and addresses in local storage though, because this leaves me vulnerable to cross site scripting.</p>  <p>Storing this information on the server would break the stateless principles of REST API's.</p>  <p>Are there any suggestions on how to best architect my application?</p>
