<p>I'm installing a program with an administrator user with UAC disabled in Windows 2012 and the installer only works when running it using "Run as Administrator" option from context menu.</p>  <p>I thought this option was used to bypass UAC checks and give the user full administrator permissions but since UAC was already disabled it doesn't make sense.</p>  <p>Could you please give mi some light on this?</p>  <p>Thank you!</p>
