<p>I have set (I think) all the proxy settings for windows and npm works. However bower does not, this is the error I am getting:</p>  <pre><code>  download https://github.com/jquery/jquery/archive/2.1.4.tar.gz      retry Download of https://github.com/jquery/jquery/archive/2.1.4.tar.gz failed with ECONNRESET, retrying in 1.7s      retry Download of https://github.com/jquery/jquery/archive/2.1.4.tar.gz failed with ECONNRESET, retrying in 2.2s     Error: EPERM: operation not permitted, unlink... </code></pre>  <p>The file that displays after unlink does not even exist. </p>  <p>Bower version: 1.5.3 Node version: 4.1.1 OS: Windows_NT 6.1.7601 x64.</p>  <p>How can I avoid this error?</p>
