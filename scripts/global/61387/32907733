<p>I am developing a MANE (Node + Express + Mongo + Angular) app.<br> While developing, I currently use a <code>package.json</code> file like this:</p>  <pre><code>"scripts": {     "start": "nodemon ./bin/www",     "test": "mocha", } </code></pre>  <p>So that, when I start developing. I run <code>npm start</code>, and <code>nodemon</code> starts watching my sources, restarting express server when anything changes.<br> If I want to run tests, I run <code>npm test</code>, and mocha tests are done.<br> Since I also need testing routes, I have to run <code>npm start</code> (in a terminal window) and then <code>npm test</code> (in a second terminal window).<br> So far so good.<br> But what if I want to re-run tests on every change?<br> I did try something like this:</p>  <pre><code>"scripts": {     "start": "npm run test &amp;&amp; nodemon ./bin/www",     "test": "mocha", } </code></pre>  <p>But this doesn't work, since, when test are done, nodemon is not yet started, so I get this error:</p>  <pre><code> Uncaught AssertionError: expected [Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:3000] to deeply equal null </code></pre>  <p>By the other hand, I can't reverse the order of the commands (<code>nodemon ./bin/www &amp;&amp; npm run test</code>), since nodemod is blocking...</p>  <p>Any clue how to solve this "conundrum"?</p>
