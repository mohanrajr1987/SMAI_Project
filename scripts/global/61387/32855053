<p>Grunt has suddenly stopped building correctly locally. It's not building assets that are served by Angular, and the console is giving the following message:</p>  <p><code>Uncaught Error: inc/../../../common/js/sv-common missing inc/../../../common/js/./lib/ngui-sortable</code></p>  <p>EDIT: more detail</p>  <pre><code>Uncaught Error: ../../common/js/sv-common missing ../../common/js/./lib/ngui-sortable &gt; main @ www-app.js:296call &gt; Dep @ www-app.js:166 &gt; main @ www-app.js:291call &gt; Dep @ www-app.js:166main @ www-app.js:291 &gt; req @ www-app.js:359 &gt; (anonymous function) @ www-app.js:3737 &gt; (anonymous function) @ www-app.js:3738 </code></pre>  <p>I've done a fresh checkout of the repo, and no one else on my team is having the same issue. The missing file is absolutely in my local repo, and it's also in the tmp/ directory of it. I honestly have no idea how to debug this.</p>  <pre><code>$ grunt --stack -d Running "jshint:local" (jshint) task [D] Task source: /workspace/survata-com/node_modules/grunt-contrib-jshint/tasks/jshint.js &gt;&gt; 0 files linted.
