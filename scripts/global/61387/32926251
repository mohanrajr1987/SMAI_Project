<p>I'm getting unexpected behavior when using npm. For example when installing express with the command:</p>  <pre><code>npm install express </code></pre>  <p>I would expect that a folder named, "express" would be created in the "node_modules" directory and that it's dependencies would be installed within a "node_modules" sub-directory within this folder. </p>  <p>What I am seeing is that the "express" folder is being created but all of it's dependencies are being added to the root "node_modules" directory (same level as express) in my project folder and not nested within the "express" folder.</p>  <p>Why is this happening? (using npm v3.3.5)</p>
