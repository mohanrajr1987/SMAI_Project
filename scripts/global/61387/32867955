<p>I have a problem using <a href="https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer" rel="nofollow">Autoprefixer</a>  I tried installing using:</p>  <pre><code>npm install -g autoprefixer </code></pre>  <p>and I tried installing it in my project only:</p>  <pre><code>npm install autoprefixer --save-dev </code></pre>  <p>but nothing seems to help. Every time I get ther error:</p>  <pre><code>-bash: autoprefixer: command not found </code></pre>  <p>I am using OSX Yosemite, node v4.1.1 and npm v3.3.4.</p>  <p>Note that I am not trying to use Autoprefixer for Gulp or Grunt, I am trying to make a setup where it would run as a npm script (as mentioned <a href="http://blog.keithcirkel.co.uk/how-to-use-npm-as-a-build-tool/" rel="nofollow">here</a>).</p>  <p>If you need any additional info just ask, I will provide anything needed. This is just frustrating I spent 2 hours trying to fix it but without any luck.</p>  <p>Thanks for all smart answers!</p>
