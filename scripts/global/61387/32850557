<p>I am using <em>node 4.1.1</em> on my Ubuntu machine (<code>15.04 x64</code>) and I am severly, thoroughly disappointed by nodejs' package manager's i.e. the famous <em>npm</em>. Whenever I try to create / scaffold a project, all npm has to say is:</p>  <pre><code>npm ERR! Linux 3.19.0-28-generic npm ERR! argv "/home/prakhar/Softwares/node-v4.1.1-linux-x64/bin/node" "/home/prakhar/Softwares/node-v4.1.1-linux-x64/bin/npm" "install" npm ERR! node v4.1.1 npm ERR! npm  v2.14.4 npm ERR! code ECONNRESET npm ERR! errno ECONNRESET npm ERR! syscall read  npm ERR! network read ECONNRESET npm ERR! network This is most likely not a problem with npm itself npm ERR! network and is related to network connectivity. npm ERR! network In most cases you are behind a proxy or have bad network settings. npm ERR! network  npm ERR! network If you are behind a proxy, please make sure that the npm ERR! network 'proxy' config is set properly.  See: 'npm help config' </code></pre>  <p>I never found myself in a situation like this with other tools. I have used python's <code>pip</code>, Java's <code>Maven</code> and <code>Gradle</code> and even Perl's <code>cpan</code>, all of them working so swiftly and transparently. Despite that, I am so very surprised that nodejs is so popular among developers.</p>  <p>Can anybody please suggest me how can I troubleshoot the problem?</p>
