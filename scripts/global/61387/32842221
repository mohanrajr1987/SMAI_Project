<p>We have an single page application developed in angular js using nodejs\npm\grunt . I am tyring to integrate this into an asp.net 4.5 mvc project. For the most part of it, I was able to preserve the DEV environment by using the new task runner functionality in VS. I changed the build events to run npm\bower install and do a grunt build before the .net code builds. But I realized that our build server isn't connected to Internet and thus can't restore node and bower packages  I am not able to checkin the node packages into TFS as some of the have very long paths that are incompatible with most of windows tools. Is there any way to get around this issue i.e. can we install node &amp; bower packages from offline source on the build servers? Thanks.</p>
