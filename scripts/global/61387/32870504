<p>So, in Angular Seed npm start is configued as follows </p>  <p>"start": "http-server -a localhost -p 8000 -c-1"</p>  <p>I want to run this through my IP so I can test in a VM. I tried substituting "localhost" with my current IP but I get an error running npm stat. </p>  <p>Quite obviously I have little to no understanding how node and it's serve work and frankly the docs didn't help much...</p>  <p>I've been looking to a simple answer to this simple question for 20 minutes now, so I apologize if this is a duplicate. </p>  <p>Thank you!</p>
