<p>I have been using nodejs a lot lately but I keep coming up against a similar error. There are a huge amount of projects out there and a lot of them have npm packages, but whenever I attempt <code>npm install --save some-package</code> I can't seem to figure out how to use them. I don't mean things like express, or mongoose, which I seem to be able to use just fine. I mean things like Bootstrap, or right now, <code>masonry-layout</code>.</p>  <p>For instance I followed the steps on the masonry layout page, and executed the following steps:</p>  <p><code>npm install --save masonry-layout</code></p>  <p>Then according to the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/masonry-layout" rel="nofollow">npm page for masonry-layout</a> I added to following to my general purpose <code>scripts.js</code> files (I am keeping small snippets I need in here until I separate code more logically):</p>  <pre><code>$('.grid').masonry({   // options...    itemSelector: '.grid-item',   columnWidth: 200 }); </code></pre>  <p>However I get the following error in my console on page load:</p>  <pre><code>TypeError: $(...).masonry is not a function     $('.grid').masonry({ </code></pre>  <p>I get similar problems when I try and use other frontend node modules or projects. Am I missing something? I always just end up using the cdn or installing the files manually and I am getting tired of working that way.</p>
