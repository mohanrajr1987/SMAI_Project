<p>I am trying to run ember locally on my Windows 7 machine</p>  <p>When I load my app for the first time, the ember build is successful and ember serve starts and I can access my app.</p>  <p>However, as soon as I make even a small change in my code and try to refresh, I get the following error;</p>  <blockquote>   <p>ENOTEMPTY, directory not empty   'C:\MyCode\myProj\tmp\tree_merger-tmp_dest_dir-cQOjj10S.tmp\modules\ember-validations\validators'</p> </blockquote>  <p>I am using Sublime Text editor and have added the following in Preferences: Settings > User</p>  <pre><code>"folder_exclude_patterns": [".svn", ".git", ".hg", "CVS", "tmp/*"] </code></pre>  <p>While I have seen other solutions like  Disable Windows Search Index for temporary files (Windows does not seem to be already indexing my tmp folder) Disable Windows Defender for temporary files</p>  <p>Please note I do not have Admin rights on my system (it's a company provided system). I do have anti-virus running, but cannot disable it. So kindly suggest any fixes accordingly.</p>
