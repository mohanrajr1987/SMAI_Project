<p>So I made the mistake of trying to get rid of all sudo dependencies. I downloaded npm as a package from the site and did a manual/global install. But it seemed as if i was always having to run with sudo...so I tried to uninstall and run with homebrew.</p>  <p>Now I can't get node or npm to even run...I guess I have to link with brew link them but i'm getting this error:</p>  <pre><code>Could not symlink share/doc/node/gdbinit Target /usr/local/share/doc/node/gdbinit already exists. You may want to remove it:   rm '/usr/local/share/doc/node/gdbinit' </code></pre>  <p>I've tried removing that: And i've gotten permission denied.</p>  <p>I have tried running brew prune. I have tried to uninstall then reinstall using these steps:</p>  <pre><code>$ brew uninstall npm $ brew uninstall node $ npm uninstall npm -g $ sudo rm -rf /usr/local/lib/node_module </code></pre>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12607155/error-the-brew-link-step-did-not-complete-successfully">Error: The &#39;brew link&#39; step did not complete successfully</a></p>  <p>I am running Yosemite 10.10.5. I have git version 2.6.0 installed. My homebrew is updated. A brew doctor gives me this warning:</p>  <pre><code>Warning: You have unlinked kegs in your Cellar Leaving kegs unlinked can lead to build-trouble and cause brews that depend on those kegs to fail to run properly once built. Run `brew link` on these:     node </code></pre>  <p>Not sure where to go from here. I'm trying to lose my reliance on CodeKit and get gulp up and running.</p>
