<p>I'm just curious about the differences between these 3 configuration settings?</p>  <p>If I set <code>proxy</code> to a value, do all requests go through that or is it just HTTP and not HTTPS? Is it a catch all?</p>  <p>Whereas <code>http_proxy</code> and <code>https_proxy</code> are specific to the type of request? The documentation for <code>proxy</code> didn't really highlight this fact and made it sound more like an alias for <code>http_proxy</code>.</p>
