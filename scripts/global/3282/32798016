<p>I'm running Ejabberd 15.07.33 on Ubuntu Server 14.04. I'm using the basic configuration, just added <code>mod_offline_post</code> (from <code>mod_interact</code>). I've read about dead connections problem and how to overcome it, but this post on ejabberd website (<a href="https://www.ejabberd.im/faq/tcp" rel="nofollow">https://www.ejabberd.im/faq/tcp</a>) says that unacknowledged messages should end up in offline storage, which is not the case in my situation. is there any special config that I should set to let this happen? I've tried to set `resend_on_timeout but didn't change anything.</p>  <p>Thanks for your help.</p>
