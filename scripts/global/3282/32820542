<p>I am using XMPP Framework to send and retrieve message from openfire in my iPhone application. When i send first message to openfire, I can retrieve that message without any problem but when i quit app and retry to retrieve that message, unable to retrieve that message. If i send second message then there is no problem after that application works fine.. If anyone of you has already faced this problem and got some solution. Please help me... There is no problem in XMPP connection and Authentication. </p>
