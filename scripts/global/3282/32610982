<p>I have been using the normal javascript ajax chat i created manually. I also used this same format to create phone android messenger app. But it was using normal sockets.  so i have migrated to using ejabberd IM server and have developed the xmpp client messenger and it is working well with mysql module configurations. But now i have history chats for messages by users and want to maintain the message. So i want to transfer these messages to the new database table called archive under ejabberd. I have failed import the messages as they are very many in thousands. so if some one know a script i can use to do the migration of data to the new database that will be good.</p>
