<p>I have developed a simple android app and JAVA XMPP server (of only .java files) which sends and receive messages to android devices using Smack Library.<br> I want to put this project on web (instead of local machine) so that I can send messages anytime.</p>  <p>I also have a separate Java Web Application project running on Tomcat in NetBeans in which I have pasted my server's source files, so I can deploy this one too. <br> P.S. - I have also tried openshift.com (jBoss EWS 2.0) but I don't know how to add Smack Libraries to it.</p>  <p>Which are recommended hosting sites?</p>
