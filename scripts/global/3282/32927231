<p>I have been working on an Android application which includes a chat module using XMPP protocol. I have taken smack library for client side support i.e library is integrated with Android Application. I have written a Java class(Activity) which includes a UI to show the incoming and outgoing chat.</p>  <p>Please find the code snippet below I have used:</p>  <pre><code>    ChatManager chatManager = xmppconnection.getChatManager();     chat_Chat = chatManager.createChat("name of chat partner", null);       chat_Chat.addMessageListener(new MessageListener() {         public void processMessage(Chat chat, Message message) {             messageBody = message.getBody();              android.os.Message msg = android.os.Message.obtain();             msg.obj = messageBody;             handler.sendMessage(msg);         }     }); </code></pre>  <p>In some cases <strong>processmessage</strong> gets invoked and in that situation,incoming and outgoing chats are obtained ,but i have identified that ,if <strong>processmessage</strong> method is not invoked then incoming and outgoing chats are not received . I am failing to identify the exact reason for which the failure of invoking <strong>processmessage</strong> method. If anyone knows the reason for this,then please explain me the background process happening at this time.</p>  <p>Also I would like to exact difference between a messagelistener and chatmanagerlistners.I have been stuck for few days because of these issue. ,Please advise me for the same.</p>
