<p>Currently I am making an application in which I have to implement chat module.</p>  <p>I've also set up a local server and I'm able to see online buddies.</p>  <p>But when I test my app in the simulator or on a device I am not getting buddy list in my app. How to save user data in coredata and fetch it to display users? I followed <a href="http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/building-a-jabber-client-for-ios-interface-setup--mobile-7188" rel="nofollow">this tutorial </a>  . </p>  <p>Please help me if possibe.</p>
