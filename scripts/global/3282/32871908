<p>I'm using Smack 3.1.0 for XMPP connection and it is giving 'Can not connect to server' through jrockit 1.6.0_101 JVM. But it is working fine with jrockit 1.6.0_95. Also using Java JDK instead of Oracle jrockit 1.6.0_101 is also working.</p>  <p>I tried using Smack 3.2.2 and 3.4.1 as well. But still XMPP connection is not made with jrockit 1.6.0_101 version with these versions as well.</p>
