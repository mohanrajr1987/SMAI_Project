<p>I'm planning to create an instant messaging app in android where user can create groups, add people to group (just like whatsapp) and after checking XMPP client and server list for two days, I'm totally confused.</p>  <p>After checking blogs over blogs, I come to know that I can use Openfire with Smack 4.1 for the same. Would that be a good choice? Or do I need to use other client/server combination? Also where could I get some tutorials on the same to headstart my work. </p>  <p>I have a basic understanding of android and relatively new to XMPP concepts so please feel free to edit/suggest changes to the question.</p>  <p>Thanks alot for your help :)</p>
