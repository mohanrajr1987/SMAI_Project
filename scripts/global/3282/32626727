<p>The following is a brief overview of GCM: <a href="https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/gcm" rel="nofollow">https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/gcm</a></p>  <p>I have googled around and have decided to go with CCS (XMPP) approach: <a href="https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/ccs" rel="nofollow">https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/ccs</a></p>  <p>but I couldnt find any code sample to get started. I'm trying to do push notification from my java based backend service and send message to my subscribers (different content for each subscriber depending on their states). The broadcast will be done on a weekly basis, so like every Wednesday, I will send downstream messages to all my mobile app clients (11700 clients give or take, covering both IOS and Android). Can anybody show a link or perhaps post sample java code? I also read about using Smack library for CCS implementation? Thanks</p>
