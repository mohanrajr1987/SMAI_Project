<p>I've tryed several times to re-flash my Beaglebone Black with some images downloaded from the beagleboard website and elinux website, following these instructions to re-flash:</p>  <p><a href="http://derekmolloy.ie/write-a-new-image-to-the-beaglebone-black/" rel="nofollow">http://derekmolloy.ie/write-a-new-image-to-the-beaglebone-black/</a></p>  <p>And after the process is done (all user leds are solid off), i take off the micro sd and switch on the board and all user leds start to blink (not all together) and a few second later only the user led 2 keeps on (solid) and I cant acess it.</p>
