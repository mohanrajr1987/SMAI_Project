<p>I want to install OMRON D6T MEMS Thermal Sensor in my bathroom and when I enter the bathroom the sensor should detect a human and send some data/signal to mac. I would like to know all the steps involved in making this work. I don't know much about the wiring of the sensors so would need help from scratch. </p>
