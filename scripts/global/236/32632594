<p>I am developing a new wireless IoT-product for a company. The current prototype is using ZigBee for communications and I am currently trying to figure out how to avoid having to run a dedicated ZigBee-Coordinator device. I do not want to develop a second hardware just to let it act as the main ZigBee Coordinator. For this hardware Meshing is very important.</p>  <p>So I read about the Digi S2C modules and stumbled over the fact that this module has a larger flash and therefor incorporates all three ZigBee-Firmwares (End-Device, Router, Coordinator) into one single file. With using serial-commands you can then change the device-mode from coordinator to router or end device. </p>  <p>By thinking about it I came up to the following idea how to avoid having a second hardware just acting as a coordinator.</p>  <ol> <li><p><em>By powering up the first hardware unit the ZigBee Module runs as a Router / End-Device and is looking for a coordinator</em></p></li> <li><p><em>If there is no coordinator the module resets itself and changes its     device-mode to become the coordinator</em></p></li> <li><em>Every following unit does the same and will connect to the first     unit which acts as the coordinator</em></li> </ol>  <p>Using this concept I could stick with my single hardware and let it automatically choose between running as an End-Device, Router or Coordinator. </p>  <p>Questions are:</p>  <p>I know that you can put custom code onto the ZigBee-Modules controller. Is this controller able to reset itself and restart in a different operation-mode? Like leaving a flag before restarting or so?</p>  <p>Or do I need a second controller that is taking care of such a process?</p>  <p>Am I missing some detail in the ZigBee-Stack that has already implemented such a concept?</p>
