This application is based on FreeRTOS, and application contains 128Ã—64 kind of monochromatic LCD (Graphical LCD), having controller like ks0107.</p>  <p>The problem is that if we run this program with the PIN used for CY8CKIT-050, it runs smoothly and complete every task as desired with no problem at all. But if we only change the MCU PINs as used in our Hardware and program the Hardware MCU with same program, application runs to certain point and then hang. We tried debug mode and found out that after running for some time application goes to :</p>  <pre><code>CY_ISR(IntDefaultHandler) {      while(1)     {         /***********************************************************************         * We must not get here. If we do, a serious problem occurs, so go         * into an infinite loop.         ***********************************************************************/     } } </code></pre>  <p>which is in <strong>Cm3Start.c</strong>. And at this point application stays in hanged state.</p>  <p>Here please note that this only happens if we used the same program in our Hardware. But if we use it in Kit (CY8CKIT-050), it runs completely fine without any fault.</p>  <p>We would like to also share that we have used FreeRTOS prior to this application, and we have successfully built applications with FreeRTOS.</p>  <p>Attaching(as I don't know how to attach I am providing Google drive links):</p>  <ol> <li><p>Application program for CY8CKIT-050 <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/freertos/discussion/382005/thread/17f86b2a/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p></li> <li><p>Application program for our Hardware <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9VyuD_nTrnsUzhueFhuazJFblE/view" rel="nofollow">here</a> (Only with different PIN usage)</p></li> </ol>  <p>Call Stack window screen shot where problem occurs:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/WUCaD.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/WUCaD.jpg" alt="Call Stack 1"></a></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/STV3p.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/STV3p.jpg" alt="Call Stack 2"></a></p>  <p>PS: This discussion is going on in parallel at</p>  <ol> <li><p><a href="http://www.cypress.com/forum/psoc-5-known-problems-and-solutions/freertos-lcd-128x64-my-application-program-running-fine" rel="nofollow">Cypress Community Forum</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/freertos/discussion/382005/thread/17f86b2a/" rel="nofollow">FreeRTOS Forum</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="http://www.edaboard.com/thread344710.html" rel="nofollow">Other Forum</a></p></li> </ol>
