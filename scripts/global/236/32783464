<p>I am working on a project using the MCU TM4C123GH6PM and I am getting data from another MCU. So when I am getting the data from MCU#2 I send it to a COM Port. Basically I am sending  frames of that form: </p>  <pre><code>header="#", Bytes:0,0,0,0,0,0,62,64, terminator='\0'; </code></pre>  <p>What putty displays is the following:</p>  <pre><code>#&gt;@ </code></pre>  <p>I don´t understand, why I am not able to display my bytes on putty.</p>  <p>I using this code for getting the data and transmitting it to putty:</p>  <pre><code>while (1)     {         if (UARTCharsAvail(UART1_BASE)){             UARTCharPut(UART0_BASE,(unsigned char)UARTCharGet(UART1_BASE));           }     } </code></pre>  <p>I am using baudrate 9600 on MCU#1, MCU#2 and putty. What is the problem?</p>  <p>EDIT: since a raw byte contains 8 bits while putty is ascii based and an ASCII-character has 7 bits. That ´s why I cannot display my bytes. This means that displaying these bytes on putty is <strong>impossible</strong>. <strong>Is my analysis right????</strong></p>
