<p>I am looking at the STM32f4xx project template, generated by the <a href="http://gnuarmeclipse.github.io/" rel="nofollow">GNU ARM Eclipse</a> plugin, with semihosting enabled. The <code>main</code> function is defined with both <code>argc</code> and <code>argv</code> parameters, which is pretty useless in a freestanding embedded program, but in case of semi-hosted debugged program they can be passed used some mechanism. So my question is <em>how do I access this mechanism</em>? Right now, without any changes to the template and the project settings, the <code>argv[0]</code> equals to a string <code>"foobar"</code>, which I have no idea where it came from. And I have no idea how to pass some other string to it. Some more information:<br>  - IDE: Eclipse + <a href="http://gnuarmeclipse.github.io/" rel="nofollow">GNU Arm Eclipse plugin</a><br>  - Toolchain: <a href="https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded" rel="nofollow">GCC ARM Embedded</a>  <br>  - Debug: Eclipse + OpenOCD + GDB from the toolchain<br>  - Hardware: STM32f401vC<br></p>  <p><strong>Update</strong>: I am starting to suspect the constant is buried deeply in the <code>newlib</code> code. I can see where the args reading is triggered (it's in <code>_syscals.c</code>) by <code>call_host (SEMIHOSTING_SYS_GET_CMDLINE, &amp;cmdBlock);</code>, but I can't figure out where it is handled. It is then transformed to a <code>bkpt 0xAB</code> and from there I am lost.</p>
