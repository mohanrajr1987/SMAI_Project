<p>My requirement is to capture video from an Analogue camera. But I am not getting which embedded hardware should I use to connect it. I have used Raspberry Board with USB and Pi camera. And I am not sure whether an analogue camera can be connected to Raspberry board or not by some means using other converter etc. If not then is there any board on which I can connect and then capture the videos ? I know toradex board can used but if there is another hardware available ?</p>  <p>Thanks    </p>
