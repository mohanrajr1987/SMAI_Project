<p>I recently came across this question and could not find supporting document or data in explanation. The question was asked to me and the person was not willing to share the answer.</p>  <pre><code>#define BIT(A)       BIT_##A #define PIN_0        0 </code></pre>  <p>"Do we get BIT_0 by using macro BIT(PIN_0)? If no make necessary corrections?"</p>  <p>I dont know the answer to the above question?</p>
