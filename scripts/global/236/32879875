<p>I don't know if there's a program that can convert ASM to C. I checked google and I've read that IDA Pro can do it but I don't know how. Anyway, can you help me convert this section of code written in ASM to C? I'm not good in assembly so I hope you can help me. Thanks :)</p>  <p>Here's the code:</p>  <pre><code>#define CALIBRATIONTIME     .10 ;Number Of Times To Measure Signal During Calibration  ;********************************************************************************************** ;Calibrate() - Measures A Period From The Input(GP0) Reference Signal ;            - Updates Osccal Value ;            - Updates E^2  ;********************************************************************************************** CALIBRATE     movlw   CALIBRATIONTIME     movwf   COUNTER     ;Calibration Counter  LOW0     btfsc   INPUT0      ;Wait To Sample Low Edge #0 (Makes Sure We Are Synchronized First Time Through)     goto    LOW0          HIGH1     btfss   INPUT0      ;Wait To Sample High Edge #1     goto    HIGH1        clrf    TMR0        ;Start Timer  (Timer Will Be Behind By 5us After This Instruction)  LOW1     btfsc   INPUT0      ;Wait To Sample Low Edge #1     goto    LOW1  HIGH2     btfss   INPUT0     goto    HIGH2     movf    TMR0,W      ;Stop Timer (Timer Will Be Stopped 3us Late)     addlw   .2      ;Timer Is Behind By 2us Total From Start To Stop         call    CHECKPERIOD ;See If Osccal Needs To Be Adjusted  LOW2     btfsc   INPUT0      ;Wait To Sample Low Edge #2     goto    LOW2     decfsz  COUNTER,F   ;Decrement The Calibration Counter     goto    HIGH1     call    UPDATE_EE   ;Update E^2     return </code></pre>
