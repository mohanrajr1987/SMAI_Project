<p>Hello USB / Linux gurus!</p>  <p>I have an embedded system based on an Atmel ARM Cortex-A5 CPU.  It runs embedded Linux kernel V3.10 that configures its high-speed USB port as a USB device.</p>  <p>The USB device is configured as a USB composite made up of HID, NDIS Ethernet and MTP.  Everything is working well.</p>  <p>However When plugging in this embedded system into a host OS like Windows, a situation arises when I must notify Window of the new MTP device.  Currently the only way I know how to do that is to physically unplug the USB cable from the embedded system and plug it back in.  Windows then notices the 'new' MTP connection, opens a folder pointing to the files on my device and everything is great!</p>  <p>I would like to find a way to do exactly the same thing programmatically... in other words bring my USB device port down and up just as if I were using 'ifconfig' for Ethernet.</p>  <p>Is there some command I can use to suspend and resume a USB device port?</p>  <p>Thank you very much!</p>  <p>Jean-Pierre</p>  <p>P.S. The USB driver I'm using is called 'atmel_usba_udc.c' and contains functions like 'atmel_usba_stop()' and 'atmel_usba_start()' that I'd like to invoke from user-space.</p>
