<p>I am using a message queue Template in C++ to queue my messages which happens to  queue SIP messages.My queue size is fixed and when I increase the rate and number  of messages I am able to detect an over flow in the message queue.</p>  <p>I would like to avoid the message queue overflow. So if some one can guide me in practical overflow avoidance techniques in message queues It would help much.</p>  <p>Suggestions regarding popular POSIX message queue overflow avoidance are also welcome as I would get some ideas from it.</p>
