<p>I would like to know if anyone has any recommendations for books that cover writing device drivers for embedded systems.</p>  <p>The majority of resources that I can find for writing device drivers relate to writing for linux or windows but I am looking for books or websites that cover "bare metal" embedded systems.</p>  <p>As these books expect there to be an OS in the background they skim over or completely leave out many subjects that they expect to be handled by the OS (ie. message queueing, etc.)</p>  <p>I have experience in writing device drivers (I2C, UART etc.) but I would like to improve by learning how to write good quality, safe, fast and concurrent drivers.</p>  <p>Could anyone recommend any books/websites or articles?</p>
