<p>We are developing an embedded application on Java and for our application we need to modify some parts of the JVM. The execution platform is beaglebone black which is an arm based platform. I can not find the sources of JDK for arm embedded systems. How can I get the source codes?</p>  <p>P.S.:I can make these modification to openJDK but I guess I can't run normal JDK on arm processors.</p>
