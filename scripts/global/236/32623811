<p>I have a simple loadable kernel module which controls an LED by providing blinkingPeriod, on/off features etc...</p>  <p>The device is present at /sys/led , and functions fine.</p>  <p>I have provided an input paramater for the command line which takes in which GPIO the LED is connnected to. Now I want to reuse the same kernel module, for an additional number of LED's, however I cannot load the module with insmod for additional LED's with a different command line parameter, since an error is thrown:</p>  <p>Error: could not insert module - File exists.</p>  <p>I know this is telling me that I cannot load the same module twice, but what is the best approach when trying to provide LKM's for multiple devices ? </p>  <p>The only solution I can think of is to re-write a LKM for each individual LED/device which hardly seems efficient, or pack all of the LED's in one LKM which isn't very scalable/portable.</p>  <p>Does anyone have any comments on the best approach. Thanks in advance.</p>
