<p>I had to upgrade my C# application for a Symbol Mobile Computer (MC32N0) running Windows Embedded Compact 7, that was written for an MC3090 running CE 5.0 and CE 6.0.</p>  <p>Thus, I had to move from Visual Studio 2005 to Visual Studio 2008, because 2008 had the Compact Framework 3.5. (Embedded Compact 7 comes with CF3.5)</p>  <p>So I compiled my application with no errors or warnings, things look great, and I go and install the application to the device, open my app, and get an "InvalidCastException" error.  No idea why.</p>  <p>Why?</p>
