<p>I try to find a structure in php that will do this job:</p>  <pre><code>$a = array(1,2); $b = array(3,4); $c = array(); $c[$a] = 100; $c[$b] = 200;  $i = $c[$a] + $c[$b];  echo $i; </code></pre>  <p>As you can see i have used arrays but this seems not to be correct because i get this:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Warning: Illegal offset type in C:\xampp\htdocs....... on line .....</p> </blockquote>  <p>Which is the proper structure i should use. Can this job de done with arrays? Thanks in aadvance!</p>
