<p>There are N cities and N one-way bridges in country There is exactly one incoming and one outgoing bridge for each city.</p>  <p>country wants to be elligible to host the comptition. A country is "elligible" for the comptition, if and only if you can travel from any city to any other city of that country. You are asked to perform the minimum number of steps to help country become an elligible comptition host. So how can i do it ? </p>
