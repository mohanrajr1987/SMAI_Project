<p>I have been trying to construct a structure for wind data in matlab using the struct function:</p>  <pre><code>struct(fieldname1,value1,fieldname2,value2,......). </code></pre>  <p>I have wind speed and direction at different heights such as <code>40,50,80,90</code> meters. The problem is I don't understand how to represent the 'value', for my big data.</p>  <pre><code> wind_data=struct(ws40,[],ws50,[],ws80,[],ws90,[],wd40,[],wd50,[],wd80,[],wd90,[]) </code></pre>  <p><code>ws</code>=wind speed. <code>wd</code>=wind direction and each of them are vectors.</p>  <p>Therefore would you please help me.</p>
