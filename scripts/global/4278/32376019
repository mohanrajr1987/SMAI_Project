<p>I've been using this little function in a lot of my other scripts to grab important information from text files that my numerical models spit out. It works fine but it fills the command window the "none" when it is executed. Any idea why? I believe it has something to do with the fact the function doesn't return anything?</p>  <p>Here is the code:</p>  <pre><code>#Grep for python. To run from command prompt: python -c 'import grepy; grepy.grep("input.txt","keyword",'output.txt)'  def grep(f1,search,f2):         f2 = open(f2,'w')         for line in open(f1):             if search in line:                 print f2.write(line)         f2.close() if __name__ == '__main__':         grep() </code></pre>
