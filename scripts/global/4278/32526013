<p>I'm going to develop a relational database on server side with MySql RDBMS.</p>  <p>Since this database will contain many informations and there will be many simultaneous queries, i'd like to setup an optimized structure to avoid slow processes when retrieving datas.</p>  <p>My main table called "account" will contain information about name, surname ecc.. of users:</p>  <pre><code> TABLE 'account'   ID - NAME - SURNAME - AGE   Primary key -&gt; 'ID' </code></pre>  <p>The second table will be called "file" and has an id (foreign key referring account.id), a filename and a column called 'count':</p>  <pre><code> TABLE 'file'   ID - FILENAME - COUNT   Primary key -&gt; {'ID','FILENAME'}   Foreign key -&gt; 'ID' -&gt; 'account.ID' </code></pre>  <p>My last table is called 'visit' and has this structure:</p>  <pre><code> TABLE 'visit'   ID - FILENAME - OPTION   Primary key -&gt; {'ID','FILENAME'}   Foreign key -&gt; 'ID' -&gt; 'account.ID'  Foreign key -&gt; 'FILENAME' -&gt; 'file.FILENAME' </code></pre>  <p>While first table won't contain many rows, second table could have something like thousands of rows and third table hundreds of thousands rows.</p>  <p>Maybe i'm wrong (i'm not an expert about db system management and optimization :D), but if i make simultaneous queries on 'visit' table with so many rows and joined with other tables, the process could become slow.</p>  <p>Is this structure good or can be improved?</p>  <p>Last question, can i update automatically 'file' -> 'count' column with the count of rows contained in 'visit' where 'file.filename' = 'visit.filename' when 'visit' table is updated ?</p>  <p>Or it's better to make a query like 'SELECT count(*) from ecc..' every time?</p>  <p>Hope i explained myself, thanks.</p>
