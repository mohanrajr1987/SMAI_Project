<p>I have a php class that allow me to create, update &amp; delete profile.</p>  <p>The delete method do basically the following:</p>  <ul> <li>Get information about the profile from the db;</li> <li>Delete the profile from the db;</li> <li>Remove any profile relation from the db;</li> <li>Delete profile assets on the server (ie. photo, uploads, etc...);</li> <li>and so on...</li> </ul>  <p>My question is, how can I implement an error system for the whole process.</p>  <p>For example, what if, for example, the script blocked at "Remove any profile relation from the db" because of an unexpected error?</p>  <p>Is there any validation that can be done before processing to make sure that deletion won't stop at the middle of the process?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
