<p>Sorry First! New to android and Java but old school C programmer back in the day. I know I need to use a Class instead of struct. However java has new etc which I don't get yet. I want a simple array of a class (formally struct) and to be able to access the n'th element. Simple in C but a headache in java/android.</p>  <p>This is what I have (pseudo code) in C... <br> 1. Struct contains name and age etc say info.<br> 2. Array of the structure info[10] (say finite amount of ten elements).<br> 3. I can easily access/get/put info into array ie info[5].Name = "Bud"; info[5].age = 55; etc.<br> <br></p>  <p>So my question, regarding java and android studio, is how do I create a finite array of a class ( say info) and put (or get) the name "Bud" and age of 55 into (or out of) the 5'th element of the array class info?</p>  <p>If it can't be done in java as simply as in C maybe I am barking up the wrong tree. Perhaps there is a good website that will start out with a simple class array and show how to manipulate the different parts of the class array?</p>  <p>Thanks,</p>
