<p>I have been programming with PHP and MySQL for about a year now and I am going to have a go at my first large scale project. I am currently trying to play how I will structure the whole site database and I am running into a couple of issues to do with structure. Just for brevity I'll describe it as a social network for gamers. </p>  <p>So each player will have a list of favourite games, and those games will have unique properties. In this site each user in the users table will have multiple games. Im trying to figure out what is the best way to approach this:</p>  <ul> <li>Is it best to store multiple games in a string that can be downloaded and parsed, and then a table of each individual games? </li> <li>Shall I have a table of users, a table of favourite games and a table of games with their attributes. And if I do it this way should I have a user as each row and then a string that could be parsed into a list, or should i have each row as 1 user and 1 game then run a search and return the rows when needed.</li> </ul>  <p>As you can probably tell Im just getting confused with how to handle database structures. Any and all advice would be appreciated, thank you very much for reading this.</p>
