<p>Background information: I have a JVC GY-HM600 Video camera where I recorded 3 hours of a Dance recital. It was recorded onto a Sony Mico SD 64 GB card. The video was recorded in the AVCHD format, this is a specific file / folder structure where the actual video files are files with the extention .mts under a folder named \Stream.</p>  <p>Past actions: I transcoded this video into .MOV files with Apple's Final Cut Pro version 6 and successfully created an Final Cut Pro project.</p>  <p>Future intentions: My intention is to save this SD card with a copy of my Final cut Pro project file so that I can clear out all files on my IMAC to recover space and , if needed, reload / recreate the original project anytime in the future.</p>  <p>What happened: I plugged this card into my USB SD card reader to visit files stored on this card and I started encountering file IO errors. I ejected the "disk / chip", plugged it back in and instead of the name on the disk (as seen in the finder window) I saw the name as "Untitled". The disk  chip had no files stored on it. The SD card used on a different camera (my front camera) worked perfectly. FYI: Front camera chip was Scan Disk, bad one was Sony.</p>  <p>What I want to do: Rercreate te entire AVCHD file structure on a new SD card using the transcoded .mov files still on my IMAC drive.  Why I want to do this. The size of the .mov files transcoded will not fit on a 64 gb card. The AVCHD format transcodes into uncompresed files with no apparent loss of quality. I know of no other compressed format that Final Cut Pro can transcode so well.</p>  <p>Thanks for any help in this matter.</p>
