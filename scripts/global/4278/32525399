<p>I'll make it short:</p>  <pre><code>public aClass[] changeClassSlightly(aClass[] ac) {     // changing various things in the class     // changes done     return ac; } </code></pre>  <p>meanwhile, in the main:</p>  <pre><code>aClass test = new aClass(); test = changeClassSlightly(test); </code></pre>  <p>So, is this an inefficient / looked-down-uppon or unstandard way of doing things, when wanting to implement a functionality regarding a certain class into a different class?</p>  <p>In my case, the here called "aClass" is a fairly simple one, but when these things get bigger and bigger, taking the whole object and spitting it out slightly changed may be considered bad programming.</p>  <p>Is it, though? Is it the sighn of bad data structure or common practise in Java development?</p>  <p>Thanks a lot in advance and thanks for bearing with me :) </p>
