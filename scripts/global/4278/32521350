<p>I'm writing a database migration script in Python, in which I create a dictionary which can migrate the database between versions. I currently do this as follows:</p>  <pre><code>def from1To2():     pass  # migration script here def from2To1():     pass  # migration script here # etc  migrations = {     1: {'up': from1To2},     2: {'down': from2To1, 'up': from2To3},     3: {'down': from3To2, 'up': from3To4},     4: {'down': from4To3}, } </code></pre>  <p>But every time I create a new migration, I need to write two migration scripts (up and down) AND put them in the migrations dictionary. Since the migration functions are really small (normally two lines), I thought of directly writing them in the migrations dict. In Javascript this would look something like:</p>  <pre><code>migrations = {     1: {         'up': function(){ addSomeColumn(); recordChange(); },          'down': function(){ dropSomeColumn(); recordChange(); }     },     2: etc } </code></pre>  <p>Because the migration functions are often two lines, I don't think I can use lambda functions. Does anybody know any other way of directly writing functions in a dict in Python? All tips are welcome!</p>
