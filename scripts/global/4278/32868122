<p>I've got some Python code as follows:</p>  <pre><code>for emailCredentials in emailCredentialsList:    try:        if not emailCredentials.valid:            emailCredentials.refresh()    except EmailCredentialRefreshError as e:        emailCredentials.active = False        emailCredentials.save()        # HERE I WANT TO STOP THIS ITERATION OF THE FOR LOOP         # SO THAT THE CODE BELOW THIS DOESN'T RUN ANYMORE. BUT HOW?     # a lot more code here that scrapes the email box for interesting information </code></pre>  <p>And as I already commented in the code, if the <code>EmailCredentialRefreshError</code> is thrown I want this iteration of the for loop to stop and move to the next item in the <code>emailCredentialsList</code>. I can't use a <code>break</code> because that would stop the whole loop and it wouldn't cover the other items in the loop. I can of course wrap all the code in the try/except, but I would like to keep them close together so that the code remains readable. </p>  <p>What is the most Pythonic way of solving this?</p>
