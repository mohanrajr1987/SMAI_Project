<p>I am trying to make a good decision about how to structure my MySQL database.</p>  <p>I can best explain this by example:</p>  <p>I have a table called <code>customers</code>. A customer can control one or more <code>sites</code>. <code>Sites</code> has his own table. The tables <code>customers</code> and <code>sites</code> have a primary key <code>id (AUTO-INCREMENT)</code>. Most customers can modify multiple "sites" and we are growing towards 100.000 customers. All I need to do with this information is to check if a customer can edit a site. </p>  <p>The question is: how can I store my data best if I want to keep the queries to a minimum and the performance best? 1. I create a serialized array of all "sites" that a customer can edit and put it in a column in <code>customers</code> table. 2. I create a child-table for <code>customers</code> called <code>customer-site</code> in which I write all site_id's that the customer has access to.</p>  <p>As you probably can read I don't have a lot of knowledge, so any information why is very appreciated!</p>  <p>Best regards, Abayob</p>
