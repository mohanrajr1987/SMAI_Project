<p>I have a task to do and the content of the task is:</p>  <p><em>Please suggest a definition of linked list, which will keep the person's name and age in a <strong>flexible structure</strong>. Then write the procedure for inserting elements with the given name and age.</em></p>  <p>What exactly is a flexible structure? How to define it? And then how to malloc the size?</p>  <pre><code>typedef struct Test { int age; // ? char name[?]; // ? struct Test * next; }Structure;  int main(void) { Structure *one = malloc(???); } </code></pre>
