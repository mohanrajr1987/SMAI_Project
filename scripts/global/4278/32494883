<p>I need some advice for the choice of my table structure.</p>  <p>I am working on a project where I need to save values that are a combination of a variable amount of other values.</p>  <p>For example :</p>  <pre><code>A = b,c,d B = z,r </code></pre>  <p>I was thinking on saving the combinations in a json object inside a column but I am afraid it can be long for big requests and not easy for filtering.</p>  <p>There was also the solution of having a multiple amount of columns (containing null when not necessary), but this will not be a good representation of the data, also filtering will be hard.</p>  <p>Finally I thought the best would be many to many relations, but the joins might be too heavy, are they ?</p>  <p>Do you see any other alternative (besides switching to nosql) ?</p>
