<p>I have a function which assess a time series of data over a particular range within that time. </p>  <p>The output of the function is a structure array. The function is performed over a given range of time e.g 0 to 15 seconds. I would like to produce iterate this so that I can get the results for the each time interval. E.g structure 1 = 0 to 15 seconds; structure 2 = 15 to 30 seconds and so on. </p>  <p>So far this is what I have but I am unable to save/get the results for each iteration, on the last one (e.g 15 to 30):</p>  <pre><code>for i = 1:2         while n&lt;30        y(i) = function(n n+15);            n=n+15;     end end </code></pre>
