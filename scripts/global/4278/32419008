<p>I have a function that traverses a binary search tree <code>traverse(node_t*)</code>, where:</p>  <pre><code>typedef struct node_t{     char *key;     char *item;     struct node_t *parent;     struct node_t *left;     struct node_t *right; }node_t; </code></pre>  <p>Would I be able to use the same function <code>traverse(node_t*)</code> with a <em>different</em> structure under the same identifier by doing something to the header file? e.g. a different structure such as: </p>  <pre><code>typedef struct node_t{     char *key;     char *item;     struct node_t *parent;     struct node_t *left;     struct node_t *right;     struct node_t *next; }node_t; </code></pre>  <p>where I've simply added a member to the structure that wouldn't be accessed in the function anyway.</p>
