<p>I am trying to understand the structure concept in C with array of pointers.Here is my code snippet</p>  <pre><code>typedef struct Student {    char name[20];    int marks;    struct Student *a_ptr[10]; }stu;  main() {   stu member;   printf("member : %d\n",sizeof(member)); } </code></pre>  <p>My question is, In main function when I am trying to find sizeof(member) I am getting the value as 104 bytes. I can understand that char name[20] and int marks holds 24 bytes. I can't understand how compiler calculates the rest of the 80 bytes for struct student *aptr[10].</p>
