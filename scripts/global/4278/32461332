<p>I have this group of structs within SOAP:</p>  <pre><code>    [17] =&gt; struct GetListPOSResponseType {                              ListPOS ListPOS;                              }     [18] =&gt; struct ListPOS {                              Row Row;                            }     [19] =&gt; struct Row {                         string PointOfSale;                         string Description;                        } </code></pre>  <p>As you can see, there are 3 nested structures. I will need to use this for SoapVars and I understood that I need to rebuild this structure using classes, but I've never nested them before and I don't really have a clue on how to do that.</p>
