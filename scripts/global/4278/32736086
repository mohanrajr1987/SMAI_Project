<p>I have recently built a website using Umbraco with Visual Studio, and have subsequently moved this to my IIS server. The structure is as so:</p>  <pre>  -Root           -Sites         -ApplicationHost                                   -UmbracoSite </pre>  <p>My problem is that when the site looks for the Media folder (and some other folders), it is referenced from the root directory. I've read some articles about changing the web config and the umbraco config, but neither has worked.</p>  <p>I've worked around the problem by creating a few virtual directories from root, but this is less than ideal!</p>  <p>Can anyone help an Umbracoer in need???</p>  <p>Cheers</p>  <p>Rich</p>
