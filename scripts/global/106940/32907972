<p>I have a working Laravel 5 queued job class called 'SendMyEmail' using the 'database' driver. The database 'jobs' table is filled with such dispatched jobs correctly.</p>  <p>I would like to show these jobs on a website and therefore I would like to add and save a value on a custom field called 'name' on these jobs records when they are constructed. (I would pass this name as a parameter to the SendMyEmail class constructor..)</p>  <p>Does anyone know how to do this?</p>
