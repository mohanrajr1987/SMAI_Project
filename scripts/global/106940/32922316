<p>In <code>Laravel 4</code> i used to be able to simply call </p>  <pre><code>App::abort(404) </code></pre>  <p>Is there an equivalent in <code>Laravel 5</code>?</p>  <p>There seems to be surprisingly limited information out there about this at the time of writing. I've found discussions on how to <em><a href="https://laracasts.com/discuss/channels/general-discussion/how-to-register-a-custom-404-in-laravel-5?page=1" rel="nofollow">catch NotFoundHttpExceptions</a></em> but that isn't what I want, as the url structure is already processed by my <em>routes.php</em> file. To give some more background, here's a simplified version of what I am trying to do:</p>  <p><strong>Routes.php:</strong></p>  <pre><code>Route::get('/info/{page}', array('as' =&gt; 'info', 'uses' =&gt; 'Primary@infoPage')); </code></pre>  <p><strong>Primary.php (controller)</strong></p>  <pre><code>public function infoPage($page){     $pageData = DB::table('pages')-&gt;where('url_title', $page)-&gt;first();     if(!empty($pageData)){        // great, there's a corresponding row in the database for this page, go ahead and do stuff...     }else {        // This page doesn't exist, please abort with a 404 error... but how?     } } </code></pre>
