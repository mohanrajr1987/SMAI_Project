<p>I have a <code>Project</code> model. Each <code>Project</code> can have a thumbnail, main image and other multiple assets / images (project details for example) and also multiple text contents (that would be placed in between these images). And each <code>Project</code> page will pull in these assets (except the thumbnail) and texts, and display them in a specific order (that I define by drag and drop on my control panel). </p>  <p>So basically the similar structure to what <code>Behance</code> uses for example. I'm trying to structure this using Eloquent and here is what I was thinking of doing:</p>  <p>I can have let's say <code>Asset</code> and <code>Text</code> models with <code>hasMany()</code> relationship on <code>Project</code> model. These two models would have a column called <code>pageSort</code> and then the controller would merge these two collections together and sort them using that <code>pageSort</code> column.</p>  <p>Any other suggestions?</p>  <hr>  <p>EDIT:</p>  <p>I tried to use the polymorphic relationships in Laravel, but no success yet.</p>  <p>My<code>Project</code> model:</p>  <pre><code>public function nodes() {     return $this-&gt;morphedByMany(Node::class, 'nodeable'); } </code></pre>  <p>My <code>Node</code> model:</p>  <pre><code>public function nodeable() {     return $this-&gt;morphTo(); } </code></pre>  <p>Then in my code I do the following:</p>  <pre><code>$project = new App\Project; $project-&gt;title = 'Some title'; $project-&gt;save();  $image = new App\Image; $image-&gt;source = 'somefile.jpg'; </code></pre>  <p>$project->nodes()->save($image);</p>  <p>But I get the following error:</p>  <pre><code>Illuminate\Database\QueryException with message 'SQLSTATE[42S22]: Column not found: 1054 Unknown column 'project_id' in 'field list' (SQL: insert into `nodeables` (`nodeable_id`, `nodeable_type`, `project_id`) values (5, App\Node, 1))' </code></pre>  <p>So I guess it's trying to create an entry inside a pivot table <code>nodeables</code>. Then I created this table and it saved an entry inside the pivot table, but not inside <code>nodes</code> table. </p>  <p>This is driving me mad! :(</p>
