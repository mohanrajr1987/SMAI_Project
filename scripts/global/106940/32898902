<p>Ok, so I thought I understood this, but it seems I don't have complete understanding of it.</p>  <p>I've just created an app on my local machine. I had a local <code>.env</code> file storing my local environment variables. I understand that when you commit the app to the server with git, the <code>.env</code> file isn't pushed, and that you should set the environment values on the server.</p>  <p>Well, I'm using DigitalOcean, and I have created a new virtual host file, and set the environment variables in there using the <code>SetEnv APP_ENV local</code> syntax.</p>  <p>When I access the site through the browser, I know it's picking up the env values because I get an error message saying that the base table isn't found, and the database name is what is set in my environment variables. This is fine, because I haven't run migrations yet.</p>  <p>However, When I ssh into the server, and run <code>php artisan migrate</code>, it appears to not be picking up the Env values. I assume this is because artisan is not running through an apache virtual host.</p>  <p>Does this mean I need to create a <code>.env</code> file which will store my database details etc? If so, what's the point in setting the environment variables in the virtual host file, and not just have a single <code>.env</code> file? By setting values in the Virtual Host config file, and also a <code>.env</code> file, I'm duplicating environment variables, which is surely bad practice?</p>  <p>If I shouldn't create another <code>.env</code> file for the server, how do I specify the environment values to use within artisan?</p>  <p>I hope I explained the question well enough, but if I haven't, or I need to clear something up, please ask.</p>
