<p>I've setup my laravel website at ec2 with Apache Http Server. I'm able to view the home page, but other than home page it just showing blank page with internal error (500). It work fine is my local machine.</p>  <p>I've change the httpd.conf document root to "/var/www/html/mywebsite/public" and change all the AllowOverride to All But it's still showing blank page with internal error (500) for other route. </p>  <p>i've added virtual host as below, still no luck.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;   ServerName www.mywebsite.com   DocumentRoot "/var/www/html/mywebsite/public"   &lt;Directory "/var/www/html/mywebsite/public"&gt;     AllowOverride all   &lt;/Directory&gt; &lt;/VirtualHost&gt; </code></pre>  <p>My route. (which is working)</p>  <pre><code>Route::get('/', 'IndexController@index'); </code></pre>  <p>Other route (which is not working)</p>  <pre><code>Route::get('thread/ViewThread', array('uses' =&gt; 'ThreadController@ToViewThread')); </code></pre>
