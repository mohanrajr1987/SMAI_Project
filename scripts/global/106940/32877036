<p>I'm using laravel 5.1 and I would like to know if I could only allow specific route format in my routes.php?</p>  <p>The route format should look like this (strict):</p>  <pre><code>http://example.com/archive/2015-09 </code></pre>  <p>Wherein 2015-09 is year-month. It should only accept this format (as stated above). Having a different format will only redirect to the homepage. Example:</p>  <pre><code>http://example.com/archive/2015 http://example.com/archive/asd http://example.com/archive/2015-9 http://example.com/archive/2 http://example.com/archive/2015-09-01 </code></pre>  <p>So in my routes I have this:</p>  <p><code>Route::get('archive/{date}', 'ArchiveController@index');</code></p>  <p>I saw on the documentation that <a href="http://laravel.com/docs/5.1/routing#parameters-regular-expression-constraints" rel="nofollow">regular expressions could be used</a> but I'm not sure how would I be able to do it.</p>
