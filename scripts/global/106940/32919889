<p>I am using <strong>laravel 5</strong>. What I need is to call <strong>python gearman worker</strong>. </p>  <p>I have created a <strong>gearman worker in python</strong>. And I have created a <strong>gearman client in laravel 5</strong>.</p>  <p>I have directly added gearman client code in my controller like:</p>  <pre><code>$client = new GearmanClient(); $client-&gt;addServer(); $job_data = array("func_name" =&gt; "searchTweets", "query" =&gt; "query_to_search"); $result = $client-&gt;doNormal("php_twitter_worker", json_decode($job_data)); if ($result) {     print_r($result); } </code></pre>  <p>But it throws error : </p>  <pre><code>Class 'App\Http\Controllers\GearmanClient' not found </code></pre>  <p>I know what is the error because I don't have GearmanClient Class in Controllers. Actually I don't know how to use it. </p>  <p>After doing some <strong>R&amp;D</strong> , I found a package using <a href="https://github.com/pafelin/laravel-gearman" rel="nofollow">gearman in laravel5</a> but not getting how to use it as Gearman Client and how it make a <strong>call to my python gearman worker</strong>. </p>  <p>Any help on this ?</p>
