<p>I have a map containing two objects like the below:</p>  <pre><code>TreeMap&lt;Calendar, Venue&gt; map = new TreeMap&lt;Calendar, Venue&gt;(); </code></pre>  <p>And the data looks like below:</p>  <pre><code>['11/01/2015', venue1] ['11/02/2015', venue1] ['11/03/2015', venue1] ['11/04/2015', venue2] ['11/05/2015', venue3] ['11/06/2015', venue1] </code></pre>  <p>and I want to list the data by date range; more specifically, if there is only one date per venue, then just print the date without a range, and if there are multiple dates for venue, then print only its start date and end date. So it will looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>venue1: 11/01/2015 - 11/03/2015 venue2: 11/04/2015 venue3: 11/05/2015   venue1: 11/06/2015 venue#: 11/07/2015 - 11/10/2015 ...  </code></pre>  <p>and so on. Dates are unique, but venue can appear more than once.</p>  <p>My pseudo-code was: After creating a copy of a map, loop through the maps and compare each entry. And check if locations are the same and dates are consecutive for each entry and if they are the same, store them in another data structure temporarily.  But this way, date range is not grouped by venue and there is an issue when combining these with the venue that has no date range (i.e. venue2 in this example): dates are mixed and not ordered. Is there any better way to approach? Thank you for your suggestions.</p>
