<p>This question is language-agnostic (although it assumes one that is both procedural and OO). </p>  <p>I'm having trouble finding if there is a standard name for a collection with the following behavior:</p>  <p>-Fixed-capacity of N elements, maintaining insertion order.</p>  <p>-Elements are added to the 'Tail'</p>  <p>-Whenever an item is added, the head of the collection is returned (FIFO), although not necessarily removed.</p>  <p>-If the collection now contains more than N elements, the Head is removed - otherwise it remains in the collection (now having advanced one step further towards its ultimate removal).</p>  <p>I often use this structure to keep a running count - i.e. the frame length of the past N frames, so as to provide  'moving window' across which I can average, sum, etc.</p>
