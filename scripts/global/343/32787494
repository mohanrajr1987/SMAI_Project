<p>I have a hashmap whose key type is Calendar, such as:</p>  <pre><code>HashMap &lt;Calendar, Student&gt; map = new HashMap &lt;Calendar, Student&gt; (); </code></pre>  <p>And once I sort the map by dates, I want to check if each calendar (key) in the map is consecutive per student name; for example, suppose the data in map is like this:</p>  <pre><code>('10-01-2015', student1), ('10-02-2015', student1), ('10-03-2015', student1), ('10-10-2015', student1), ('10-11-2015', student2), ('10-13-2015', student2) </code></pre>  <p>and so on.</p>  <p>Then what I want to have as a result is something like below:</p>  <pre><code>student1: 10-01-2015 - 10-03-2015 student1: 10-10-2015 student2: 10-11-2015 student2: 10-13-2015 </code></pre>  <p>I think I am going to use TreeMap to sort the map, but I am not sure how to group the consecutive keys per value.<br> How would you approach?</p>
