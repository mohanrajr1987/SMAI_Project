<p>I'm certain I cannot be the first to ask this question, but I cannot find an answer. Perhaps it's too simple and I'm over-thinking this one.</p>  <p>I have a collection of users, called <code>Users</code>. I want to create an extension method that will allow me to write <code>Users.Shuffle()</code> that will shuffle the list and the Users will be in a random order after making the call. I've found a zillion ways to do this if the collection is a list (which technically it is, I guess).</p>  <p>I apologize if this is a stupid question, but I sure would not mind someone telling me just how stupid it is - and why!</p>  <p>Here's my code:</p>  <pre><code>public static class UtilityHelpers {      private static Random rng = new Random();      public static void Shuffle&lt;T&gt;(this ICollection&lt;T&gt; collection) {          int n = collection.Count;          while (n &gt; 1) {              n--;              int k = rng.Next(n + 1); // This is where I'm stuck!!!          }      }  } </code></pre>
