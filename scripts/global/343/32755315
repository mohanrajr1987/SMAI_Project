<p>I have an ArrayList filled with 1.5 million objects of some class. When I sort this list by usage of the Collection.sort method the allocated memory of the JVM increases dramatically.</p>  <p>So my questions are:</p>  <p>Is that normal? What could be reasons for that? Is this a matter of the garbage collector working too slowly or not being started often enough? Do the objects in the list have to fulfill certain specifications to consume less memory during sort (besides not containing that much data)?</p>  <p>Thx!</p>
