<p>I have a webapp in Netbeans and I want to run it. I have tried by right clicking on it and choosing Run, but as far as I can see from the console it is trying to run another project. In particular the project that it is looking for is in hard disk that's not even attached to my computer.</p>  <p>P.S. This only happens with web applications. Console applications run properly.</p>
