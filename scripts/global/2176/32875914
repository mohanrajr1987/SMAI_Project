<p>I need to install struts2 since netbeans new version 8.* comes only with the old version of struts 1.3.*. I have searched all over on the net but i could not find any proper answer for this. Somewhere they have suggested to download the plugin nbstruts2support-nb6.9.1 which i have downloaded from <a href="http://plugins.netbeans.org/plugin/39218" rel="nofollow">http://plugins.netbeans.org/plugin/39218</a> </p>  <p>In its zip there were three plugins for struts2 so i have installed 2 of them successfully but when I tried to install the third plugin file which is struts2 Support it gave me this error and could'nt install.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Some plugins require plugin Editor Library to be installed.   The plugin Editor Library is requested in version >= 2.10.1.10.2 (release version 2) but only 3.49.2.22.43 (of release version different from 2) was found.  The following plugin is affected:       Struts2 Support </p> </blockquote>
