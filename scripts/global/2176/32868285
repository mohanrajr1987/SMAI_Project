<p>Im writing a system that uses grunt to merg css and js files. So In the different presentasjon folders I have 3 files with the same name like : cms.php, cms.css and cms.js</p>  <p>Now I was wondering if there is any way to group these three in the project file manager in netbeans. Because Im starting to get a lot of files. If not can anyone direct me in the direction of building my own pluging for this?</p>
