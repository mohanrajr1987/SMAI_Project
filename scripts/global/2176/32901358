<p>I'm new to Java GUI. </p>  <p>First I created a JFrame and have added a JPanel. After that I set it as a Null Layout. Then added a label and set a background image for the frame. For my project I need to add separate 4 JPanels for this JFrame. On those JPanels I'm going to add Labels and Text boxes. I want to know whether it's correct or not to add 4 JPanels on a main JPanel?</p>
