<p>I installed NetBeans 8.0.2 recently, and tried to set null layout for a <code>JFrame</code>.  Tried to proceed but RIGHT CLICK on the frame didn't work. I am actually trying to set a background image for a frame.</p>  <p>Someone has already posted <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26245098/cannot-right-click-on-jframe-or-jpanel-in-netbeans-8-0">cannot right click on Jframe or Jpanel in netbeans 8.0</a> but it has no answers.  </p>  <p>How to fix this problem?  Hope that someone has found a solution.  </p>
