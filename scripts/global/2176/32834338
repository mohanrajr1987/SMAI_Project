<p>I'm having trouble importing files to netbeans(IDE) with flask. So far, I have downloaded the bootstrap files and placed them in a folder called "static" (that I created), in the folder where my flask scripts and libraries are kept. On my html page I wrote :. And yes "url_for" was imported. </p>  <p>How can I make this work? For this case and future cases where I need to load different css files. Thanks in advance.</p>
