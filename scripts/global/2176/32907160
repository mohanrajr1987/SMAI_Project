<p>I hava a JavaFX app developed in Netbeans, when I do clean &amp; build there is a dist folder generated along with the jar. In the dist folder there is also a bundles folder generated.</p>  <p>If I want to do clean &amp; build again, the build fails because the bundles folder can't be deleted. I have to use unlocker to manually delete the folder...</p>  <p>This is happening rightafter I have upgraded my pc to windows 10.</p>  <p>So is there a setting where I can change the permissions? </p>  <p>What I have tried, without success: - Change permissions of netbeansprojects folder - Run netbeans as administrator</p>
