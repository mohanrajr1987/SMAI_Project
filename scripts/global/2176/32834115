<p>I have made a very simple class to test for proper Junit test generating. The problem is that when I create a Junit test, it doesn't find my methods for some reason. I have tried with multiple very simple classes without success. I am starting to think I set up Junit for the project incorrectly. Here is my simple class I am trying to test:</p>  <pre><code>package controller;  public class SampleProgram {      public int multiply(int x1, int x2){         return x1 * x2;     } } </code></pre>  <p>Here is what is generated when I create a Junit Test in Netbeans:</p>  <pre><code>/*  * To change this license header, choose License Headers in Project Properties.  * To change this template file, choose Tools | Templates  * and open the template in the editor.  */ package controller;  import org.junit.After; import org.junit.AfterClass; import org.junit.Before; import org.junit.BeforeClass; import org.junit.Test; import static org.junit.Assert.*;  public class ProgramTest {      public ProgramTest() {     }      @BeforeClass     public static void setUpClass() {     }      @AfterClass     public static void tearDownClass() {     }      @Before     public void setUp() {     }      @After     public void tearDown() {     }  } </code></pre>  <p>Any help as to why my method isn't being found and generating the test is much appreciated. I have not used Junit before and am completely lost. Thanks</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong> Here is a screenshot of my editor with a Junit test provided from Jose Martinez. The imports are the defaults for when netbeans creates a Junit test. <a href="http://i1377.photobucket.com/albums/ah45/snowborder011/junit_errors_zpsc57dl52e.png" rel="nofollow">Screenshot</a></p>
