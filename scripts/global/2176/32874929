<p>I'm very new to computer programming -- having literally started the course a little under 6 weeks ago -- and I'm having trouble currently with illegal starts of expressions in Netbeans. </p>  <p>The whole code goes as follows(since I don't even really know where to start): </p>  <pre><code>public class Employees {     /**      * @param args the command line arguments      */     public static void main(String[] args) {         // TODO code application logic here         public class Employee          //properties         private String name;         private String ID;         private String salary;          //constructor         public Employee (String name, String address, String dob) {             this.name = name;             this.ID = ID;             this.salary = salary;         }          //method to print details on employees         public void printDetails() {             System.out.println("Employee name: " +this.name);             System.out.println("ID: "+ this.ID);             System.out.println("Annual Salary: " + this.salary);         }     } } </code></pre>
