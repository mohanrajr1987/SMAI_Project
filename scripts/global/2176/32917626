<p>I tried in two popular IDEs, eclipse and netbeans, to import a jar file named stdlib which contains a bunch of stuff. StdDraw is part of it but even after referencing it, the IDEs keep telling me it doesn't exist when I use their methods.</p>  <p>I have browsed stackoverflow and read other questions/answers and followed instructions to the letter. So why is this not working?</p>
