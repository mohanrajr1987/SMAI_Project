<p>I have well tested java program in Netbeans. When I run that application in Netbeans, I can login in to the system(using apache mysql as database)</p>  <p>Then I clean and build the project and created the jar file. When I run that jar file I cannot go further than the login form.</p>  <p>when I give correct login details, system shows that as an error saying incorrect logins.</p>  <p>What is the wrong here ?</p>
