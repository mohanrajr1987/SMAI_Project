<p>I am having some trouble with NetBeans and clang++, I cannot find the Make Command which the IDE requests upon my trying to run a basic project with a main file containing a print statement. As well, I am receiving an error from the IDE that in cannot include cstdlib even though I have c++11 enabled in the idea, as far as I am concerned. Cannot include file  is the error NetBeans provides. Solutions would be appreciated. Also, my default namespace std created by default  when I created the project is not being identified, it also returns an error at this line: using namespace std; above the main method. </p>
