<p>Spring data offers a convenient way to limit results with the keyword Top or First.</p>  <p>We can read in the Spring Data ES documentation :</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The results of query methods can be limited via the keywords first or top, which can be used interchangeably. </p> </blockquote>  <p>Which means calling this method for instance :</p>  <blockquote>   <p>User findFirstByOrderByLastnameAsc();</p> </blockquote>  <p>Nonetheless, the list of supported keywords for Elasticsearch does not contain the keyword Top or First.</p>  <p>I ran several tests using the latest version of spring data elasticsearch and effectively, the Top and First keyword does not work.</p>  <p>Be aware of that.</p>  <p><a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring-data/elasticsearch/docs/current/reference/html/" rel="nofollow">The Spring Data ES documentation Version 1.3.0.RELEASE, 2015-09-01</a></p>
