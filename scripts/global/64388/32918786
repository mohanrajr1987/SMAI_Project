<p>I am using NEST with ElasticSearch and I trying to search by allowing users to type search phrases into a search box.  All is working fine apart from the fact when the user enters a search phrase they need to make sure the field name is the same case as the field name in Elastic search.</p>  <p>For example, one of my fields is called bookTitle.  If they search like below then it works</p>  <p>bookTitle:"A Tale of Two Cities"</p>  <p>If they search like the example below it does not work</p>  <p>booktitle:"A Tale of Two Cities" BookTitle:"A Tale of Two Cities"</p>  <p>The code I am using to search is below.  Does anyone have any ideas on how I can fix this.  I was hoping that there is an ElasticSearch/NEST setting that allows me to do this as opposed to doing somehthing ugly with the search text like finding "BookTitle" and replacing with "bookTitle".</p>  <pre><code>   public List&lt;ElasticSearchRecord&gt; Search(string searchterm) {          var results = _client.Search&lt;ElasticSearchRecord&gt;(s =&gt; s                         .Query(q =&gt; q                             .QueryString(qs =&gt; qs                                 .DefaultField("content")                                 .Query(searchterm)                             )                         ));           return results.Documents.ToList();     } </code></pre>  <p>Any help greatly appreciated.</p>
