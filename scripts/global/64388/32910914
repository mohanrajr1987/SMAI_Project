<p>Is there a way to configure opsworks to set the elasticsearch heap size when it start the instances? I am using this cookbook <a href="https://github.com/elastic/cookbook-elasticsearch/" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/elastic/cookbook-elasticsearch/</a> and the custom json doesn't seem to have any property for heap size.</p>  <p>I found that <code>allocated_memory</code> in <code>elasticsearch_configure</code> is the one I need to modify but not sure if it's possible to do so in the custom json or without creating my own recipe.</p>
