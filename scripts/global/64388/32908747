<p>I'd like to be able to autocomplete partial words to full words found in my documents and return a list of words and the number of documents those words are found in.</p>  <p>It would be great if I could also do this on an existing query results. So if they user typed "red tr" I would have results for all documents that match red and then words like truck or train with their counts.</p>
