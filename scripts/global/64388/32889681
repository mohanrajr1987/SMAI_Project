<p>My documents have geo_shapes to associate them to an area. If I give ES (1.7) a geo_point I'm wanting it to give me back the documents where the point falls within that area.</p>  <p>I've recreated with the following toy example:-</p>  <pre><code># create the index put location_test put location_test/_mapping/place {   "place": {     "properties": {       "message": {"type": "string"},       "coverage": {"type": "geo_shape"}     }   } } # check the mapping is correct get location_test/place/_mapping  # location 1 put location_test/place/1  {   "message": "we will be in this box",   "coverage": {     "type" : "envelope",         "coordinates" : [[1, 0], [0, 1] ]     } }  # location 2 put location_test/place/2 {   "message": "we will be outside this box",   "coverage": {     "type" : "envelope",         "coordinates" : [[2, 1], [1, 2] ]     } }  # all documents returned - OK  get location_test/place/_search {   "query": { "match_all": {}} }  # should only get document 1, but get both. get location_test/place/_search  {   "query": {     "geo_shape": {       "coverage": {         "shape": {           "type": "point"           "coordinates": [0.1,0.1]         }       }     }   } } </code></pre>
