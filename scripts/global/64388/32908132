<p>I'm trying to generate a script field in Kibana 4 and I need to compute the difference between a date field and the current date:</p>  <p>(current_date - doc['startDate'].value)</p>  <p>I would also like to know if there is a way I could use the date range (from-to) of every kibana query in the script field. ex:</p>  <p>(to_date - doc['startDate'].value)</p>  <p>Any help?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
