<p>I am using below bool query to find documents that contain either of the pattern "Hello" or "World". And I am giving a boost of 2 to the AND query to make sure that the documents that contain both the tokens i.e. "Hello" and "World" are listed first(Have higher score)</p>  <pre><code>        {:bool=&gt;{         :should=&gt;[           {               :query_string=&gt;{                 :query=&gt;term               }           },            {               :query_string=&gt;{                 :query=&gt;term,                 :default_operator=&gt;"AND",                 :boost=&gt;2               }             }         ],      :minimum_should_match=&gt;1         }} </code></pre>  <p>The above query serves my purpose. There might be other ways of doing it . But that is Ok. My main concern now is that once I get the result set from the above query I want to know how many documents starting from top are the AND documents i.e. (Containing both the tokens) and how many of them are the OR documents i.e. (Containing one of the tokens).</p>  <p>I want to find that boundary/seperation between AND/OR documents in the result set.</p>  <p>Any ideas.</p>
