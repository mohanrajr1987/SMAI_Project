<p>I am trying to implement an analyzer (uppercase) and index some documents after that in elasticsearch. My question is, am i following the correct procedure?</p>  <pre><code>Implement your analyzer (containing index and type name), which would create the index if it doesnt exist  Then index the documents with the same index and type name as above during which stream of text would pass through the analyzer and then would be saved in index. </code></pre>  <p>Is this the correct way to go about it?</p>  <p>I indexed some documents with and without using analyzers, checked the contents of index before/after using <em>Facets</em>, and they were no different.</p>
