<p>I've been trying to remove fields starting with the underscore (e.g., <code>_type</code>) from Kibana, since it may be confusing to others unfamiliar with logstash/elasticsearch.</p>  <p>However, after reading <a href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/2551#issuecomment-69045927" rel="nofollow">this</a> I got a bit confused...</p>  <p>Has anyone been able to disable or hide these fields at Kibana?</p>
