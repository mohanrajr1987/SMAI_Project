<p>I'm using ES <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.0/search-aggregations-bucket-datehistogram-aggregation.html" rel="nofollow">Date Histogram</a> and a weird behavior started happening and I'm wondering why.</p>  <p>This is the request i'm sending to elasticsearch:</p>  <pre><code>{    "from": 0,    "size": 0,    "query": {       "filtered": {          "filter": {             "and": [                {                   "bool": {                      "must": [                         {                            "range": {                               "publishTime": {                                  "from": "2010-07-02T12:15:20.000Z",                                  "to": "2015-07-08T12:43:59.000Z"                               }                            }                         }                      ]                   }                }             ]          }       }    },    "aggs": {       "agg|date_histogram|publishTime": {          "date_histogram": {             "field": "publishTime",             "interval": "1d",             "min_doc_count": 0          }       }    } } </code></pre>  <p>The result i'm getting are buckets, and the first bucket is:</p>  <pre><code>{    "key_as_string": "2010-08-24T00:00:00.000Z",    "key": 1282608000000,    "doc_count": 1 } </code></pre>  <p>So i'm filtering from 2010-07-02 and getting results only from 2010-08-24</p>  <p>This is just an example, I also saw this behavior with many more missing buckets (several months).</p>  <p>[edit] this seems to correlate with the date of the first result, meaning that the first result in that time range is from 2010-08-24, but as I included <code>"min_doc_count": 0</code> I expect to get results from that entire range</p>
