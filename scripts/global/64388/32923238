<p>I am using packetbeat in af_paket traffic capturing mode, which give me about 30% CPU footprint on single core instance when I go for http and mysql monitoring only. As soon as I increase more header and cookie capture in http, CPU goes a little bit higher.</p>  <p>I am getting lots of "WARN Response from unknown transaction. Ignoring" warnings too, looks like packetbeat ignores already established connection's communication. We are using pool of mysql connection in application, can it cause this issue ??</p>  <p>I am unable to find any documentation which can help me in setting up a dedicated server for packetbeat and how can I forward traffic from application servers to packetbeat instance. If I can do so then it will offload computation from application servers.</p>  <p>On application server we are having about 100 rps including web and mysql. Is it expected behaviour with this amount of traffic ?? If that so then how safe it is to run packetbeat in production servers ??</p>  <p>Packetbeat version info, I am using "1.0.0-beta3 (amd64)" on ubuntu 14.04.</p>
