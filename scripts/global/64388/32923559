<p>In this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22661996/example-of-angular-and-elasticsearch#new-answer">thread</a> John D explain how to combine ES with AngularJs. When I render index.html with Firefox, the page dosn't show results of a test search on elesticsearch server, nevertheless I followed all steps in the tutorial. Maybe Is it a configuration problem of elasticsearch?</p>  <p>Anyone knows why?</p>  <p>Any Suggestion is very helpful for me.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
