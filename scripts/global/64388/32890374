<p>Is there any way to delete documents from ElasticSearch using Logstash and a csv file? I read the Logstash documentation and found nothing and tried a few configs but nothing happened using action "delete"</p>  <pre><code>output {     elasticsearch{         action =&gt; "delete"         host =&gt; "localhost"         index =&gt; "index_name"         document_id =&gt; "%{id}"     } }  </code></pre>  <p>Has anyone tried this? Is there anything special that I should add to the input and filter sections of the config? I used file plugin for input and csv plugin for filter.</p>
