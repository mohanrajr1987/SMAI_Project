<p>I can't find any informations on <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-ca/library/azure/dn798928.aspx" rel="nofollow">Azure Search documentation</a>  about how the results are sorted when the query sent is empty. I've also read the  <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/empty-search.html" rel="nofollow">Empty Search</a> section of <code>ElasticSearch</code> but still can't find any answer.</p>  <p>Is this sorting by Key?</p>  <p>Is the backend sending a batch of parallel requests and concatenate the results since the sorting doesn't matter?</p>
