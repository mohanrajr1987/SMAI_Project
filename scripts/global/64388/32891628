<p>We are trying to remove "doc" field which gets added on top of original document by Couchbase while doing XDCR.</p>  <p>For example: </p>  <p>Below is our sample original document :-</p>  <pre><code>{    "UserID": "User1",    "FirstName": "First",    "LastName": "Last",    "Roles":    [      {        "RoleID" : "1",        "RoleName": "R_1"      }    ] }  </code></pre>  <p>But when we do XDCR from Couchbase to ElasticSearch, Couchbase adds "doc" field which holds the original document. Below is the sample document created by Couchbase XDCR :-</p>  <pre><code>{    "doc":    {        "UserID": "User1",        "FirstName": "First",        "LastName": "Last",        "Roles":        [          {            "RoleID" : "1",            "RoleName": "R_1"          }        ]     }  } </code></pre>  <p>Is there a way to remove this "doc" field?</p>  <p>Thanks, Sameer</p>
