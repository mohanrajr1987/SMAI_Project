<p>I have some articles in my ES index that contain emoji icons.  I'd like to perform a search for articles that contain specific emoji characters.  I'm using compose.io as my ES provider and via ElasticHQ I can see the emojis in the data - they are rendered as icons in OS X, so I assume the unicode is stored correctly.  However, when I run this query I get no results.  If I run a plain text search I do get my results.  I'm using mongoosastic.</p>  <pre><code>Article.search({query_string: {query: "ðŸ˜•"}},             {fields: "title"},              function(err, results) {             if (err) {                 console.log("error: " + err);             } else {                     console.log("results: " + JSON.stringify(results));                      }         });  //results: {"took":6,"timed_out":false,"_shards":{"total":5,"successful":5,"failed":0},"hits":{"total":0,"max_score":null,"hits":[]}} </code></pre>
