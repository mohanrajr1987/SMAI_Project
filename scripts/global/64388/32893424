<p>I have documents with a field that contains multiple dates. </p>  <pre><code>"release_date" : [ "2015-07-10", "2015-07-13", "2015-07-26", "2015-07-27" ] </code></pre>  <p>I would like to <strong>filter all documents with at least a date greater than a another given date</strong>.</p>  <p>I was able to use range filter when the document just had one date</p>  <pre><code>{     "constant_score": {         "filter": {             "range" : {                 "release_date" : {                     "gte": "2012-01-01",                 }             }         }     } } </code></pre>  <p>But now that I have more than one date, I don't find the way to achieve a similar result. Is it possible?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
