<p>I am new to spark and trying to figure things out. We have a usecase where different users want to process the data differently in real-time and these users come and go. As I understand, I can create a stream for the underlying data and go into a foreachRDD to run my computations. But this assumes that I know all the computations I need to do a'priori. </p>  <p>Is it possible to add additional computations by going into the foreachRDD in a separate thread when a new User requires a new computation?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
