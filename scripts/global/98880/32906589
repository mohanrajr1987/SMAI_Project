<p>I'm experimenting a problem when trying to write any RDD to HDFS. I've tried with minimal examples, scala programs and pyspark programs both in local and cluster modes and as standalone applications or shells. </p>  <p>My problem is that when invoking the write command, a task is executed but it just creates an empty folder in the given HDFS path. I'm lost at this point because there is no sign of error or warning in the spark logs. </p>  <p>I'm running a seven node cluster managed by cdh5.4.7, spark 1.3. HDFS is working properly when using the command tools or running MapReduce jobs. </p>  <p>Thank you for your time, I'm not sure if this is just a rookie mistake or an overall config problem. If not a workaround, I'll appreciate also any clue or place to look for logs and errors.</p>  <p>Just a working example: </p>  <p>This sequence produces the following log and creates the empty folder "test", no _SUCCESS or part_xxxx files. </p>  <pre><code>scala&gt; val l = Seq.fill(10000)(nextInt)  scala&gt; val dist = sc.parallelize(l)  scala&gt; dist.saveAsTextFile("hdfs://node1.i3a.info/user/jarias/test/")  </code></pre>  <p>The log:</p>  <pre><code>15/10/02 10:19:22 INFO FileOutputCommitter: File Output Committer Algorithm version is 1  15/10/02 10:19:22 INFO SparkContext: Starting job: saveAsTextFile at &lt;console&gt;:27  15/10/02 10:19:22 INFO DAGScheduler: Got job 3 (saveAsTextFile at &lt;console&gt;:27) with 2 output partitions (allowLocal=false)  15/10/02 10:19:22 INFO DAGScheduler: Final stage: Stage 3(saveAsTextFile at &lt;console&gt;:27)  15/10/02 10:19:22 INFO DAGScheduler: Parents of final stage: List()  15/10/02 10:19:22 INFO DAGScheduler: Missing parents: List()  15/10/02 10:19:22 INFO DAGScheduler: Submitting Stage 3 (MapPartitionsRDD[7] at saveAsTextFile at &lt;console&gt;:27), which has no missing parents  15/10/02 10:19:22 INFO MemoryStore: ensureFreeSpace(137336) called with curMem=184615, maxMem=278302556  15/10/02 10:19:22 INFO MemoryStore: Block broadcast_3 stored as values in memory (estimated size 134.1 KB, free 265.1 MB)  15/10/02 10:19:22 INFO MemoryStore: ensureFreeSpace(47711) called with curMem=321951, maxMem=278302556  15/10/02 10:19:22 INFO MemoryStore: Block broadcast_3_piece0 stored as bytes in memory (estimated size 46.6 KB, free 265.1 MB)  15/10/02 10:19:22 INFO BlockManagerInfo: Added broadcast_3_piece0 in memory on nodo1.i3a.info:36330 (size: 46.6 KB, free: 265.3 MB)  15/10/02 10:19:22 INFO BlockManagerMaster: Updated info of block broadcast_3_piece0  15/10/02 10:19:22 INFO SparkContext: Created broadcast 3 from broadcast at DAGScheduler.scala:839  15/10/02 10:19:22 INFO DAGScheduler: Submitting 2 missing tasks from Stage 3 (MapPartitionsRDD[7] at saveAsTextFile at &lt;console&gt;:27)  15/10/02 10:19:22 INFO YarnScheduler: Adding task set 3.0 with 2 tasks  15/10/02 10:19:22 INFO TaskSetManager: Starting task 0.0 in stage 3.0 (TID 6, nodo2.i3a.info, PROCESS_LOCAL, 25975 bytes)  15/10/02 10:19:22 INFO TaskSetManager: Starting task 1.0 in stage 3.0 (TID 7, nodo3.i3a.info, PROCESS_LOCAL, 25963 bytes)  15/10/02 10:19:22 INFO BlockManagerInfo: Added broadcast_3_piece0 in memory on nodo2.i3a.info:37759 (size: 46.6 KB, free: 530.2 MB)  15/10/02 10:19:22 INFO BlockManagerInfo: Added broadcast_3_piece0 in memory on nodo3.i3a.info:54798 (size: 46.6 KB, free: 530.2 MB)  15/10/02 10:19:22 INFO TaskSetManager: Finished task 0.0 in stage 3.0 (TID 6) in 312 ms on nodo2.i3a.info (1/2)  15/10/02 10:19:23 INFO TaskSetManager: Finished task 1.0 in stage 3.0 (TID 7) in 313 ms on nodo3.i3a.info (2/2)  15/10/02 10:19:23 INFO YarnScheduler: Removed TaskSet 3.0, whose tasks have all completed, from pool  15/10/02 10:19:23 INFO DAGScheduler: Stage 3 (saveAsTextFile at &lt;console&gt;:27) finished in 0.334 s  15/10/02 10:19:23 INFO DAGScheduler: Job 3 finished: saveAsTextFile at &lt;console&gt;:27, took 0.436388 s  </code></pre>  <p>PS: This question is also posted in the user spark mailing list.</p>
