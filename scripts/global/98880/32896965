<p>I want to understand that how does saveAstestFile() work. The background for this is we have a Spark cluster which has been created on Cassandra setup. Eventually we are required to connect from Spark and store the data in another cluster(HDFS).</p>  <p>So since the access for the Hadoop cluster is in concern, we had questions on will the Master in Spark if it has access to Hadoop gateway, will that be sufficient. Or do we need all the Worker Nodes also be access Hadoop gateway access.</p>
