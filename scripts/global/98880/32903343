<p>Is it possible to create a RDD using data from master or worker? I know that there is a option SC.textFile() which sources the data from local system (driver) similarly can we use something like "master:file://input.txt" ? because i am accessing a remote cluster and my input data size is large and cannot login to remote cluster. </p>  <p>I am not looking for S3 or HDFS. Please suggest if there is any other option.</p>
