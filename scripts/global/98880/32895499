<p>I've got a <em>very</em> basic spark job, in Java. If I build the jar and send it to the remote server it runs via spark-submit without error.</p>  <p>If, in Eclipse, I run the main class it connects to the remote ResourceManager and then errors:</p>  <pre><code>Diagnostics: java.io.FileNotFoundException: File file:/Users/myuser/.m2/repository/org/apache/spark/spark-yarn_2.10/1.5.0/spark-yarn_2.10-1.5.0.jar does not exist Failing this attempt. Failing the application. </code></pre>  <p>Of course the file doesn't exist on the remote Linux box, but does exist on the local OSX box. How can I fix this? Thanks.</p>
