<p>I'd like to add a tab to the Spark UI with my own custom page. I've figured out how to do this in Spark 1.3, but I see that the classes I'm using (in org.apache.spark.ui) have been removed from the JavaDocs in the latest version so I'm a bit nervous about the long-term viability of my solution.</p>  <p>Is there a good way to do this, or am I better off firing up a personal Jetty instance?</p>
