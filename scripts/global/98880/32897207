<p>I have a lazily-loaded static java class - it exposes a method <code>getValue(Key key)</code>.  On the first call to <code>getValue</code>, it loads some data and does some relatively expensive computations.  Subsequent calls are very fast.  I also have (in Scala) an RDD[Key], <code>rdd</code>, and would like to do something along the lines of <code>rdd.map(StaticClass.getKey)</code>.  My question is: does the serialization of the <code>StaticClass</code> closure include the resource data, and therefore mean that that data will be shuffled across the network?  Or will the loading only happen on the executors (which I think is what I want)</p>
