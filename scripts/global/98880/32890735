<p>I am trying to access the Application Detail UI of a job submitted to Spark Stand Alone cluster (v 1.4). I submitted using the following command:</p>  <pre><code>./spark-submit --master spark://MASTER:7077 --deploy-mode cluster ....   </code></pre>  <p>Seems like the link to "Application Detail UI" (port:4040) is broken. Everything works if I submit locally (remove <code>--deploy-mode cluster</code>).</p>  <p>Is there a workaround? Thanks in advance.</p>
