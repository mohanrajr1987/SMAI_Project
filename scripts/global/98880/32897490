<p>I have a job that needs to save the result in parquet/avro format from all the worker nodes. Can I do a separate parquet file for each of the individual partition and read all the resulting files as a single table? Or is there a better way of going about this? Input is divided into 96 partitions and result needs to be saved on HDFS. When I tried to save it as a file it created over a million small files.  </p>
