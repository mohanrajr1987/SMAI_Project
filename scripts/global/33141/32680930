<p>I'm trying to get away from using the table layout to do specific layouts. I know it's sloppy programming so I'm redoing it. I can't seem to recreate something like this using the div tag:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;table border=10 cellpadding=10 width="90%"&gt;     &lt;tr&gt;         &lt;td align="center" width="143"&gt;             &lt;img src="http://blah.com/images/133widepixelimage.jpg"&gt;         &lt;/td&gt;         &lt;td align="center"&gt;             Some text describing the image         &lt;/td&gt;     &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I've got the border, padding, width and alignment all done in a CSS file, and that works fine. But setting the width of the centered image still doesn't allow the centered text to show up to the right of the image. It still wraps to the next line. If I center the image left, and set <code>float: left</code>, that works.  But not two centered even if the parent div is wide enough to accommodate.</p>
