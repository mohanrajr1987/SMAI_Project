<p>I've a small issue. I've an image with <code>float: left;</code> and then a div with text. The result is something like that : <a href="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/csstricks-uploads/web-text-wrap.png" rel="nofollow">https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/csstricks-uploads/web-text-wrap.png</a></p>  <p>Which is great. But when the screen got smaller, at the end, because the image is only 250px large, there's the image on the left and few words on the right. I would like to "push" the div with test under the image and center the image at the same time : when the screen is, for example 400px large.</p>  <p>How can I do this !? It seems quite easy, but all the tutos or codepen I tried just confused me...</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
