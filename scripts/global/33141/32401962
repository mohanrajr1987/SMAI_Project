<p>I'm trying to get two images float next to each other with the shape-outside property. To be specific, I have two triangle-shaped .png images, which would make up a rectangle if put next to each other. Img1 should be on the left and Img2 on the right, and they're cut so that the diagonal goes from top right to bottom left.</p>  <p>With shape-outside I managed to get the text "hug" the diagonal border of the images, so something is working alright. The darn images just won't pop next to each other.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;style&gt; .myclass {     height: auto;     width: 100%; }  .myclass img:first-child {     -webkit-shape-outside: polygon(0 0, 0 100%, 100% 0);     float: left;     width: 80%;     background-color: lightgray;     -webkit-clip-path: polygon(0 0, 0 100%, 100% 0); }  .myclass img:nth-child(2) {     -webkit-shape-outside: polygon(100% 0, 100% 100%, 0 100%);     float: right;     width: 80%;     background-color: lightgray;     -webkit-clip-path: polygon(100% 0, 100% 100%, 0 100%); } &lt;/style&gt;  &lt;div class='myclass'&gt;     &lt;img src='img/img1.png'&gt;     &lt;img src='img/img2.png'&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class='myclass'&gt;     &lt;img src='img/img1.png'&gt;     &lt;img src='img/img2.png'&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I realize that I could achieve this by doing the img in photoshop but for linking functionality I'd prefer them to stay as separate elements. Also, absolute positioning could work but that would require quite a lot of media queries as I want the site to be responsive and the amount of this kind of blocks varies and can be quite a few.</p>  <p>-Petri HÃ¤nninen</p>
