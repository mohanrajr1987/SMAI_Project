<p><strong>JSFiddle</strong> : <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/ttpkfs9s/" rel="nofollow">https://jsfiddle.net/ttpkfs9s/</a></p>  <p>I have a UI component that should arrange elements into a row and displays them with elements on the left and on the right, with the active element being in the middle:</p>  <p><code>[1][2][3]   [4]   [5][6][7][8][9]</code></p>  <p>So far I have been achieving this by floating elements <code>left</code> and <code>right</code>, while keeping the one in the middle <code>float: none;</code> (this is good enough).</p>  <p>However, way too late into implementing the navigation JS I realised that I've made a huge mistake, and that the actual order the elements are displayed in are as follows: </p>  <p><code>[1][2][3]   [4]   [9][8][7][6][5]</code></p>  <p>Which is a huge problem as these elements are supposed to be clickable /facepalm </p>  <p>Are there any at most not too invasive CSS/HTML options I can use to get the displayed order correct? </p>
