<p>I have a confusing anomaly with my floats that only happens in Firefox and seemingly only with the 3rd float of the sequence.</p>  <p>I have a row of floats (currently 9), that responsively switch from 3 per line to 2 per line. All the floats have exactly the same class so there isn't any obvious reason this one should act out. I have tried moving the floats round to see if it's one particular box - but it's always the 3rd and only in firefox.</p>  <p>My site isn't finished but I have put it up on shereewalker.com to help see the issue as well as some code below.</p>  <p>The issue happens when the screen is moved down to a two image row rather than 3 (700px break point).</p>  <p>The images also flash a little when changing but I can live with that.</p>  <p>Any ideas? I'm just a beginner at this stuff and it's very strange and frustrating.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>  <p>Basic html - repeated multiple times</p>  <pre><code>    &lt;div class="flex_one"&gt;          &lt;a&gt;&lt;img class="icon-image" src="images/new/thumb_adtc.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;div class="flex_one"&gt;          &lt;a&gt;&lt;img class="icon-image" src="images/new/thumb_adtc.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;     &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Here is the css</p>  <pre><code>.icon-image {     width:100%;     height:auto;     opacity:1;     -webkit-transition: all 900ms ease;     -moz-transition: all 900ms ease;     -ms-transition: all 900ms ease;     -o-transition: all 900ms ease;     transition: all 900ms ease; }   @media screen and (min-width:321px) and (max-width:700px) {  .flex_one {     width:44%;     height:auto;         float:left;     border: solid 2px rgb(0,81,88);     position:relative;     background-color:#000;     margin-left:4%;     margin-top:4%;     -webkit-transition: 1s ease;     -moz-transition: 1s ease;     -o-transition: 1s ease;     -ms-transition: 1s ease;     -moz-box-sizing: border-box;     box-sizing: border-box;   }  }    /*/////////////3 COLUMN LAYOUT///////////// */   @media screen and (min-width:701px) {   .flex_one {     width:28%;     float:left;     position:relative;     background-color:#000;     border: solid 2px rgb(0,81,88);     overflow:hidden;     margin-left:4%;     margin-top:4%;     -webkit-transition: 1s ease;     -moz-transition: 1s ease;     -o-transition: 1s ease;     -ms-transition: 1s ease;     -moz-box-sizing: border-box;     box-sizing: border-box;    }  } </code></pre>
