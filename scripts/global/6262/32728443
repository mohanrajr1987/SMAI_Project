<p>I have a main report with many subreports.  However each subreport is firing the same stored procedure to my sql server.  This is increasing time complexity of the main report.  I would like to reduce the number of subreports to one.  I then want the main report to select which report should be used as the subreport by using an expression.  </p>  <p>my main report has a query of its own, the dataset that is returned to the main report includes the name of the subreport that it should used, however, it is simply hiding all of the other subreports, but this DOES NOT prevent them from firing their stored procedures.</p>  <p>is there a way to have one subreport and dynamically select it at runtime?  or is there a way to prevent every single subreport from rendering, even though they are hidden?</p>
