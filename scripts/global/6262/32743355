<p>I am trying to embed a report onto my website but getting the following error</p>  <p>Mixed Content: The page at '<a href="https://mywebsite.com/blah/blah" rel="nofollow">https://mywebsite.com/blah/blah</a>' was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure resource '<a href="http://my-tableau-report-location.com/dashboard" rel="nofollow">http://my-tableau-report-location.com/dashboard</a>'. This request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS.</p>  <p>But on my JS API call I have the url with 'HTTPS://' ie '<a href="https://my-tableau-report-location.com/dashboard" rel="nofollow">https://my-tableau-report-location.com/dashboard</a>'</p>  <p>Do I need to add an API option to make it HTTPS? What am I missing? </p>
