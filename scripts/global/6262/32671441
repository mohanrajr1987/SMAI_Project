<p>Outlook loads and attaches the report, but the issue is the report is all of 96 records.  I need it to be just one record.  With other reports that come up in AcView, the report is filtered to the "Lot_Number" and therefore only showing data from that record.  It's not working with the AcReport function below.  Can someone show me where I went wrong?</p>  <pre><code>Private Sub MailClosingInstructions_Click() On Error GoTo MailClosingInstructions_Click_Err  stDocName = "ClosingInstructionsHH"  stLinkCriteria = "[LotNumber]=" &amp; "'" &amp; Me![Lot_Number] &amp; "'" DoCmd.SendObject acReport, stDocName, "PDF", "", "", "", "Important Information on Your Upcoming Closing", "Please see attached document.", True, ""   MailClosingInstructions_Click_Exit: Exit Sub  MailClosingInstructions_Click_Err: MsgBox "Oops, something went wrong.  Either you cancelled the action, or something more serious happend.  Try Again." Resume MailClosingInstructions_Click_Exit  End Sub </code></pre>
