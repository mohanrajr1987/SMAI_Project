<p>I hope someone could help me with solving this issue. I've been browsing the internet, read countless articles, and visited several forums but found no solution to this.</p>  <p>I am to generate a multi-lined report in VB.Net by using RDLC. I've set the textbox markup property into <strong>HTML</strong> and checked the custom line-height. But, to no avail, the preview the report produce doesn't reflect the value of the line-height property I've set. Is there a way to do this? A work around maybe?</p>
