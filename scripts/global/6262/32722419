<p>Browsed quite a while for this on the web, trying different things with no luck.</p>  <p>As i understand, there's no support for putting an expression on the width of a table cell/column.</p>  <p>I saw there was a lot of complaining about this, and i could find no proper workaround for my scenario.</p>  <p>I'm creating a custom report designer where the customer can add fields and all they need in a ax form, I the create the report based on all this info.</p>  <p>I have a width property they can fill in the desired width of the field and need this to be reflected dynamically in Ax.</p>  <p>In Visual Studio 2010 i have this: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/vPmii.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/vPmii.png" alt="enter image description here"></a> I have two tables, one for the headers and one for the data, in other words I can't "pad" the headers with empty spaces to make the columns expand it's width as a workaround, nor does it help to put expressions in the padding properties, as this does not expand the with of the column...</p>  <p>Any suggestions on this?</p>  <ul> <li><p>I hope i don't have to modify the XML file for the report in AX, and would this even be possible considering deployment and everything?</p></li> <li><p>Is there anyway to set these properties in ax and make it happen automatically in the report?</p></li> <li><p>Is there any version of ssrs-reports that allows for width-expressions?</p></li> </ul>
