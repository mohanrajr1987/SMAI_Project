<p>I have an SSRS 2012 table report with groups; each group is broken ie.  one group for one page, and  there are multiple groups in multiple pages.</p>  <p>'GroupName' column has multiple values - X,Y,Z,......</p>  <p>I need to group 'GroupName' with X,Y,Z,..... ie value X in page 1,value Y in page 2, value Z in page 3...</p>  <p>This is not an issue obviously! </p>  <p>Now, I need to display another column (ABC) in this table report (outside the group column  'GroupName');  this outside column itself is another column header (not a group header) in the table (report) and  it derives its name partly from the 'GroupName' column:</p>  <p>Example:</p>  <blockquote>   <ul>   <li>Value X for GroupName  in page 1 will mean,  in page 1, column Name of ABC column must be ABC-X   </li>   <li>Value Y for GroupName  in page 2 will mean, in page 2, column Name of ABC column must be ABC-Y  </li>   <li>Value Z for GroupName  in page 3 will mean,  in page 3, column Name of ABC column must be ABC-Z</li>   </ul>      <p>ie the column name of ABC must be dynamic as per the GroupName  values   (X,Y,Z....)</p>      <hr>      <p>Page1:</p>      <p>GroupName             <strong>Clm ABC-X</strong><br>   <strong>X</strong>          </p>      <p>Page2:</p>      <p>GroupName             <strong>Clm ABC-Y</strong><br>   <strong>Y</strong>         </p>      <p>Page3:</p>      <p>GroupName             <strong>Clm ABC-Z</strong><br>   <strong>Z</strong></p> </blockquote>  <p>I have been able to use First(ReportItems!GroupName.Value) in the <strong>Page Header</strong> to get GroupNames displayed in each page; I get X in page 1, Y in page 2, Z in page 3..... </p>  <p>However, when I use <strong>ReportItems</strong> (that refers to a group name) in the <strong>Report Body</strong> outside the group,</p>  <p>I get the following error:</p>  <p><strong>Report item expressions can only refer to other report items within the same grouping scope or a containing grouping scope</strong></p>  <p>I need to get the X, Y, Z ... in each page for the column ABC. Is there any suggestion you can provide me?</p>  <p>I have been able to use this - First(Fields!GroupName.Value); however, I get ABC-X, ABC-X, ABC-X in each of the pages for the ABC column, instead of ABC-X in page 1, ABC-Y in page 2, ABC-Z in page 3, ...</p>
