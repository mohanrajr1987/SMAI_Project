<p>I am learning SQA.  I am testing a native mobile app in iOS 9 on an iPhone 6.  For the bug report, I need to locate the Mac equivalent for a log file for a bug report.  My teacher mentioned there were two files that I need to locate with Xcode (I'm running Xcode 7, which I am unfamiliar with).  Can anyone please help with what those two logs are, and how I get them.</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
