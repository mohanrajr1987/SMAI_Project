<p>I am working on my project in c #, I need to display a report with in a report.</p>  <p>I am using MySQL as my database and I am creating the project on windows forms.</p>  <p>Let's say I have my parent report that contains the transaction id and other information of a customer record. Then what I want is that when the user clicks on a row/column in the table displayed on the report viewer, another report will show containing other details of the transaction and the items purchased by the customer.</p>  <p>I have tried searching about drillthrough in RDLC but I am not that lucky to find a tutorial that I can easily understand. I am just new to RDLC and in C#.</p>  <p>I hope someone could give me some idea, advice, help or even a tutorial on where/how to start. Thank you in advance!</p>
