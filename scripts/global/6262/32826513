<p><strong>How can you display the page count outside the footer?</strong></p>  <p>Hey,</p>  <p>I'm building a report for a customer. All is fine except that he wants to display the page number on the page (near the address field) instead of the footer, which is not working at all.</p>  <p>As I understand this so far, the subst.js used in the report module is responsible for replacing the <code>page</code> and <code>topage</code> classes with the page numbers.</p>  <p>The subst.js is called in the report/minimal_layout template, if <code>subst is True</code>. The boolean value is set in the report.py in the <code>get_pdf</code> method for the header and footer to <code>True</code>, while it is false for the <code>reportcontent</code>. If I'm applying bad practice and edit the Odoo core and set <code>subst=True</code> for <code>reportcontent</code>, the report engine does not render the body part of the report anymore and returns undefined.</p>  <p>Did anyone found a suitable solution for this problem?</p>
