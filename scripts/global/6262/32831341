<p>I need to make it possible to generate a custom report from a given XML file.</p>  <p>For example, if there's an XML file, I should be able to create a custom report, where I can add graphs etc or tables to display data and publish it.  One way is to go with Pentaho. </p>  <p>I need help with the basic approach. I might have to integrate this with a web application, where on a button click, it takes a particular xml file, gives you an option to edit your report and publish it or print it in pdf.</p>  <p>any help will be appreciated!</p>
