<p>I have a report in ssrs that uses Barcode font 3 of 9. It will export to pdf until I try to do that from the web. I have looked all over the web for solutions and found that I needed to restart my server that the report is stored on. This fixed the issue and the barcode was visible when you made a pdf from it. It worked for about three days, but now the issue has returned. I have checked to make sure that the font is still installed on the server and that the barcode is embedded properly. Both are still good to go. I would like to know if there is a more permanent fix, or if I am going to have to restart the server frequently. Thanks for the help!</p>
