<p>In the Acumatica Report Designer, I want to conditionally populate a field for a single Order Type based on the content of a single custom field in the same screen.</p>  <p>Below is an image of the field I want to base the condition on:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/pjgzK.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/pjgzK.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>In Report Designer, this custom field is accessible via [SOOrder.UserDocumentStatus] similar to other fields. <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/HcFVy.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/HcFVy.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>An example of how I want to do this with the Title of the report: if the Doc Status is "Order Confirmation" then the Title field will say "Order Confirmation" and if Doc Status says "Regular" it will say "Regular" in the same label.</p>  <p>Below is a dump of some functions I thought might be useful: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/hzUFZ.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/hzUFZ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
