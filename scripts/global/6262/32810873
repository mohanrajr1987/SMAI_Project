<p>I am VERY new to Crystal, so forgive me if this sounds off... </p>  <p>I am changing an existing report, that had allowed one selection for Company to allow for multiple Companies. </p>  <p>I have a Parameter Field called Company:  List of Values is Static  I have 3 Value Fields with no description: : FARM, P-EC, P-IC  Custom Values is False  Multiple Values is True  Discrete Values is True  Range Values is False </p>  <p>Formula for Display Company is Code:</p>  <pre><code>Join ( {?Company} ,  ', ' ) </code></pre>  <p>This appears to be working as heading is using this and displaying all. </p>  <p>When I run the report and select each one individually, they work fine.  When I run the report and select more than one, it always returns the records for EC. </p>  <p>The SQL that I get when selecting multiple is:  Code:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT "VW_REPORTS"."SCBA_NM"  FROM "XXXXX"."VW_REPORTS" "VW_REPORTS"  WHERE     "VW_REPORTS"."TASK_EVENT_TYPE_ID" = 360         AND (   "VW_REPORTS"."UW_TYPE" = 'Asgn')         AND (    "VW_REPORTS"."EVENT_DT" &gt;=                     TO_DATE ('25-09-2015 00:00:00', 'DD-MM-YYYY HH24:MI:SS')              AND "VW_REPORTS"."EVENT_DT" &lt;                     TO_DATE ('26-09-2015 23:59:01', 'DD-MM-YYYY HH24:MI:SS'))         AND "VW_REPORTS"."UW_TYPE" IS NOT NULL         AND (   "VW_REPORTS"."TASK_TYPE_NM" = '1795 Report' )         AND "VW_REPORTS"."USER_ID" = 'XOXO'         AND "VW_REPORTS"."ACNT_TYPE_NM" = 'PCIO'         AND "VW_REPORTS"."SCBA_NM" LIKE '%-EC'         AND "VW_REPORTS"."ACNT_PREFX_NM" = 'ACP </code></pre>  <p>'</p>  <p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!!!</p>
