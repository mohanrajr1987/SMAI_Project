<p>I have created a query which returns the percentage of customers in my table that are male v female.</p>  <p>The results when I run this query look like so:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/mvN5b.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/mvN5b.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>When I turn this query into a report (in tabular form) i have these two values nicely laid out. However, I also wish to have a pie chart in the report.</p>  <p>I have run the chart wizard and gone through it numerous times attempting to get a result, but each time i simply end up with either a completely blank pie chart, or a completely full pie chart.</p>  <p>I have also created a query which gives me the results in the form of integers (male customers = 13, female customers = 7) and tried the wizard using those values to only achieve the same result. </p>  <p>I also tried creating a query with a total count and tried to make a pie chart with that value and the 'male customers' value but again to no avail.</p>  <p>Does anyone know how to create a working pie chart?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>  <p>Edit: I should mention that I have already tried to find a solution to this on the internet but haven't found anything that works.</p>  <p>Edit2: I'm not sure if this helps but as I said above, i am also able to create a query which yields these results:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ylA9Y.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ylA9Y.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Edit3: Redid the queries as serperate</p>  <p>'Customer Gender Qry FEMALE':</p>  <pre><code>SELECT Sum(IIf(cust_title In ("Ms","Miss","Mrs"),1,0))/Count(cust_title) AS Percentage FROM [Customer Table]; </code></pre>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8O4tE.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8O4tE.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>'Customer Gender Qry MALE':</p>  <pre><code>SELECT Sum(IIf(cust_title="mr",1,0))/Count(cust_title) AS Percentage FROM [customer table]; </code></pre>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/AjaJt.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/AjaJt.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
