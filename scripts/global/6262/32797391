<p>I am using visual studio 2010 and report viewer control. I have created an rdlc report and added a table. The columns are TaxIncluded, Tax, BeforeTax, Overoll. Overoll column is the sum of the previous overoll and current value of 'BeforeTax'. Like so:</p>  <pre><code>   TaxIncluded    Tax     BeforeTax     Overall            1180    180          1000        1000           2360    360          2000        3000           5000    400          4600        7600          -1250   -140         -1110        6490 </code></pre>  <p>Now, I want the user to be able to sort the table by clicking on the column's header of the table inside the report, but if he'll do so, the overall column values will be wrong. How can I achive this ?</p>
