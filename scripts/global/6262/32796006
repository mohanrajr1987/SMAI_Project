<p>We are creating a Crystal Report. For one of the columns we need to calculate the number of days between a specific date (which comes from the table  <code>dbo.Details</code>) and the Local date.</p>  <p>This report needs to be generated for US, UK, Canada, Finland, Germany, Italy and some other countries. Country names are listed in the <code>dbo.Countries</code> table.</p>  <p>Any suggestions how to write SQL code for the above...?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
