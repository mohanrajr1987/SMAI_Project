<p>I need to implement a system that allows users to upload large files and can pause the upload if they want. </p>  <p>Is there a gem/tutorial/article that could help me to implement this in a Rails 4.2 application?</p>  <p>I took a look at <a href="http://www.resumablejs.com/" rel="nofollow">resumable.js</a> but I didn't understand well if it's possible to make it work of paperclip/carrierwave/refile and how to set it correctly. </p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
