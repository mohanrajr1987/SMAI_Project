<p>Okay so I've got an <code>MEAN</code> application on <code>Openshift</code> and I have been adding a lot to the database. Then suddenly I get the error that the file is too large from my API.</p>  <p>Okay I think, maybe the database is just full. So I go in and adds 5GB storage to the Mongo gear. Then I go back and want to continue my work... Same problem.</p>  <p>I can add a small text, and then nothing at all. And it should be added that I, before this error, were able to add even larger files to my database.</p>  <p>What can the problem be and how can I check it and fix it.</p>  <p>Some of the informations I can gather from trying to <code>SSH</code> my application.</p>  <pre><code>[ my application ]\&gt; quota Disk quotas for user 55e********************** (uid 3***):  Filesystem  blocks   quota   limit   grace   files   quota   limit   grace /dev/mapper/EBSStore01-user_home01              104668       0 6291456            9752       0  480000 </code></pre>  <p><br/></p>  <pre><code>db.stats() {     "db" : "admin",     "collections" : 3,     "objects" : 7,     "avgObjSize" : 67.42857142857143,     "dataSize" : 472,     "storageSize" : 16384,     "numExtents" : 3,     "indexes" : 2,     "indexSize" : 16352,     "fileSize" : 16777216,     "nsSizeMB" : 16,     "dataFileVersion" : {             "major" : 4,             "minor" : 5     },     "ok" : 1 } </code></pre>  <p>From what I can see here there should be plety of storage to be used. Or am I ready these numbers incorrectly.</p>
