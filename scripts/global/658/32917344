<p>My website contains a section for users to upload photo albums with up to 1000 photos. Currently, my PHP upload script keeps crashing despite my removing filesize and upload limits from the PHP.ini (I have just about removed all restrictions against file uploading). How would you suggest going about uploading this many files? I am currently just passing the $_FILES array then using the move_uploaded_file function. Would FTP allow me to upload smoother without interruptions, or should I use a new language all together? These are the errors that I am receiving: The connection was reset</p>  <p>The connection to the server was reset while the page was loading. The site could be temporarily unavailable or too busy. Try again in a few moments. If you are unable to load any pages, check your computer's network connection. If your computer or network is protected by a firewall or proxy, make sure that Firefox is permitted to access the Web.</p>  <p>--and--</p>  <p>Request Entity Too Large The requested resource /index.html/uploadAnAlbum.php does not allow request data with GET requests, or the amount of data provided in the request exceeds the capacity limit. Additionally, a 413 Request Entity Too Large error was encountered while trying to use an ErrorDocument to handle the request.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
