<p>I'm developing a rails app where users will be able to upload files. </p>  <p>Currently I have my files on an online IDE called nitrous.io. When I upload a file above 17MB in size (or a combination of files like that). I get an error that says:</p>  <pre><code>413 Request Entity Too Large openresty/1.7.10.1 </code></pre>  <p>I did some reading and found out that this is a result of the  <code>client_max_body_size</code> needing to be set in <code>nginx.conf</code> to an appropriate size. I went on and found that nginx is part of openresty and so the <code>ngnx.conf</code> file was located in <code>/etc/nginx/</code>, added the line </p>  <pre><code>client_max_body_size = 50M; </code></pre>  <p>To the file and now it looks as follows:</p>  <pre><code>user www-data; worker_processes auto; pid /run/nginx.pid; events {         worker_connections 768;         # multi_accept on; } http {         ##         # Basic Settings         ##         sendfile on;         tcp_nopush on;         tcp_nodelay on;         keepalive_timeout 65;         types_hash_max_size 2048;         # server_tokens off;         # server_names_hash_bucket_size 64;         # server_name_in_redirect off; # set client body size to 50MB # client_max_body_size 50M;          include /etc/nginx/mime.types;         default_type application/octet-stream;         ##         # SSL Settings         ##         ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2; # Dropping SSLv3, ref: POODLE         ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;         ##         # Logging Settings         ##         access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log;         error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log;         ##         # Gzip Settings         ##         gzip on;         gzip_disable "msie6";         # gzip_vary on;         # gzip_proxied any;         # gzip_comp_level 6;         # gzip_buffers 16 8k;         # gzip_http_version 1.1;         # gzip_types text/plain text/css application/json application/javascript text/xml application/xml application/xml+rss text/javascript;          ##         # Virtual Host Configs         ##         include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;         include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*; }   #mail { #       # See sample authentication script at: #       # http://wiki.nginx.org/ImapAuthenticateWithApachePhpScript # #       # auth_http localhost/auth.php; #       # pop3_capabilities "TOP" "USER"; #       # imap_capabilities "IMAP4rev1" "UIDPLUS"; # #       server { #               listen     localhost:110; #               protocol   pop3; #               proxy      on; #       } # #       server { #               listen     localhost:143; #               protocol   imap; #               proxy      on; #       } #} </code></pre>  <p>I then reloaded the nginx webserver by typing:</p>  <pre><code>sudo etc/init.d/nginx reload </code></pre>  <p>and got an <code>[OK]</code> status on that.</p>  <p>However, I still can't upload large files through my rails app. I know in PHP apps you need to change the <code>PHP.ini</code> file to allow large uploads in addition to webserver configurations, is there an equivalent in Rails?</p>  <p>EDIT: Put in the entire nginx.conf contents</p>  <p>EDIT#2: This just occurred to me; Since I can upload files between 1MB-17MB in size, does that mean that my <code>client_max_body_size</code> attribute is overridden somehow? according to the documentation, nginx's default max body size is 1MB</p>
