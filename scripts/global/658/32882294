<p>I have an angular application with a asp.net back-end. The site is hosted on site.somedomain.com and the api at api.somedomain.com. We want to post some javascript object to the server and an X amount of files. </p>  <p>Nothing tricky there.. But there's one anoying businessrequirement... It has to work in IE9 too. </p>  <p>We are unable to post the files to our web api using IE9. IE9 doesn't have the file api yet. And we were using the file api to read the image as data url, and then we send that to our back-end. So we need to find an alternative method to either extract the base64 formated dataurl from a fileupload <em>or</em> we need to find another way to post these images to our api.</p>  <p>I've tried to JSON.stringify the object we want to post into a hiddend field and then post the entire form including the selected files to api.domain.com using a hidden iframe. This solution pretty much worked, but it's nasty. I also was unable to detect wether or not the post was succesfull or not because the contents of the iframe are inaccesable due to the cross domain origin policy:</p>  <p>DOMException: Failed to read the 'contentDocument' property from 'HTMLIFrameElement': Blocked a frame with origin "<a href="http://site.somedomain.com" rel="nofollow">http://site.somedomain.com</a>" from accessing a cross-origin frame.  at Error (native)  at HTMLIFrameElement.a.onload (<a href="http://cdn.somedomain.com/app.js:x:xxxx" rel="nofollow">http://cdn.somedomain.com/app.js:x:xxxx</a>)</p>  <p>I made the server send the following headers: Access-Control-Allow-Origin * Access-Control-Allow-Methods GET, POST</p>  <p>I have not found a simple javascript that extracts the data urls from input[type=file] yet.</p>  <p>So my question is:  a.) How would you attack this problem? b.) Is there a simple, free javascript library that's able to extract a dataurl from a fileinput?</p>
