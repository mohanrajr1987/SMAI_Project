<p>I'd like to have my .htaccess set-up so uploads aren't executed and are forced to download if they're not images or videos. However I'm having some difficulty with this as I used to have it working but since changing hosts the htaccess no longer works, it instead creates a 500 error.</p>  <p>Previous .htaccess</p>  <pre><code>ForceType application/octet-stream Header set Content-Disposition attachment &lt;FilesMatch "(?i)\.(gif|jpe?g|png)$"&gt;     ForceType none     Header unset Content-Disposition &lt;/FilesMatch&gt;  Header set X-Content-Type-Options nosniff </code></pre>
