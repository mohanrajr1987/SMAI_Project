<p>I purchased a plugin to install it on my woocommerce website. But it was showing error the moment I was activating it. I contacted the developer of the plugin and he said I need to change the php.ini file in this way: <p>memory_limit to128M  <p>max_file_uploads to 100  <p>max_input_vars to15000  <p>post_max_size to 128M  <p>upload_max_filesize to 128M <p>I followed this tutorial: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojCnNgvWt9E" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojCnNgvWt9E</a> <p>and managed to activate the plugin by changing the WP_MEMORY_LIMIT to 128M. I had to modify the file "Default-constants.php" but I told the developer and he said if I don't change the file "php.ini" I'll face further problem with the plugin. <p>I can't find the php.ini file anywhere in my root directory. As mentioned in the title above, I'm using GoDaddy's Linux cPanel (Economy Plan.) I searched the other folders. Even I created a phpinfo.php to see the version of PHP my hosting account is using and the path of php.ini file. But it says it's located somewhere in a sub-folder of "urs" But where is "usr" I don't know how to contact the support team of GoDaddy. Does anyone have any idea how to find my php.ini file and modify it in the right way?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
