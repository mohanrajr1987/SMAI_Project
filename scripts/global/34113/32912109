<p>I'm new to Cassandra and I'm trying to define a data model that fits my requirements.</p>  <p>I have a sensor that collects one value every millisecond and I have to store those data in Cassandra. The queries that I want to perform are:</p>  <p>1) Give me all the sensor values from - to these timestamp values</p>  <p>2) Tell me when this range of values was recorded</p>  <p>I'm not sure if there exist a common schema that can satisfy both queries because I want to perform range queries on both values. For the first query I should use something like: </p>  <pre><code>CREATE TABLE foo ( value text, timestamp timestamp, PRIMARY KEY (value, timestamp)); </code></pre>  <p>but then for the second query I need the opposite since I can't do range queries on the partition key without using a token that restricts the timestamp:</p>  <pre><code>CREATE TABLE foo ( value text, timestamp timestamp, PRIMARY KEY (timestamp, value)); </code></pre>  <p>So do I need two tables for this? Or there exist another way? Thanks</p>  <p>PS: I need to be as fast as possible while reading</p>
