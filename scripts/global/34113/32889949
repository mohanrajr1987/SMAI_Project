<p>I am a beginner in Tableau. I have successfully connected Tableau with Cassandra. </p>  <p>I am facing an issue now.  I am trying to get the distinct count (unique) value from a given column..  The database which I have is like 17 million. (Cassandra DB) </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/AYADZ.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/AYADZ.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I even tried count (Distinct) as shown above. But it is not working as expected. </p>  <p>Can anyone help me out with this? Thanks in advance. </p>
