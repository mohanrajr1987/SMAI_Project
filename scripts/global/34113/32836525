<p>I'm new to stack overflow and this is my first question, sorry if I made any mistake in presenting.<p> I'm new to big data and Cassandra. I'm given a task to analyse why a Rest call is taking more time to serve a Request. When I checked the code is fine and the time taken is for retrieving the response from the Cassandra Database. As I'm familiar with only RDBMS, can someone help me out how should I proceed to improve the performance, means how can I optimize the query.<p> What all are the things to be followed while querying a Cassandra Database?</p>
