<p>I have 3 Cassandra node cluster with 1 seed node and 1 spark master and 3 slave nodes with 8 GB ram and 2 cores. Here is the input to my spark jobs</p>  <pre><code>spark.cassandra.input.split.size_in_mb 67108864 </code></pre>  <p>When I run with this configuration set I see that there are around 768 partitions created with around 89.1 MB of data roughly 1706765 records. I am not able to understand why so many partitions are created. I am using Cassandra spark connector version 1.4 so the bug is also fixed regarding input split size.</p>  <p>There are only 11 unique partition key. My partition key has appname which is always test and random number which is always from 0-10 so only 11 different unique partition. </p>  <p>Why so many partitions and how come spark decide how much partitions to create</p>
