<p>I have a 6 node cluster and I kept the replication factor as 3 and 3 for the two data centers. I inserted a single row as test and later more rows. As the replication factor is 6 I want to check if the data is written into all nodes. How can I individually check if the data is present in that node. Worst option i got is shutting down the remaining 5 nodes and checking select statement from the 1 node and repeating same on all nodes. Is there any better way to check this? THanks for your time.</p>
