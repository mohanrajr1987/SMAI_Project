<p>I am working with cassandra on odroid-xu4 with its Ubuntu-14 image. (I also tried Ubuntu-15 image. (<a href="http://odroid.com/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=en:xu3_release_linux_ubuntu" rel="nofollow">http://odroid.com/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=en:xu3_release_linux_ubuntu</a>)<br> I installed the latest cassandra and its python driver. However trying to connect to it from the cassandra python-driver gives a serios bus error and makes the python quit. Not even raises an exception.</p>  <pre><code>from cassandra.cluster import Cluster k = Cluster(['127.0.0.1']) k.connect()  #crashes the python. Bus error appears on the command prompt/terminal </code></pre>  <p>Can anybody point me in the right direction? Looks like some incompatibility between things. I confirm that I can successfully cqlsh to the cassandra.</p>
