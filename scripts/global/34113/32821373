<p>My cassandra table structure is as follows:</p>  <pre><code>CREATE TABLE sujata           ... (ID int, roll_number int, age int, PRIMARY KEY (ID,roll_number)); </code></pre>  <p>I had inserted some of the records where ID acts as a partition for a number of rows. I am performing the following query:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT count(*) FROM sujata WHERE ID=1 ORDER BY roll_number ASC and age=24 Allow Filtering; </code></pre>  <p>I am getting the following error:</p>  <pre><code>missing EOF at 'and' (...1 ORDER BY roll_number ASC [and] age...)"&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I don't know if it possible to filter out the results after performing order by. Please suggest where am i missing. Thank you.</p>
