<p>I have been unable to decipher on how to proceed with a use case.... </p>  <p>I want to keep count of some items, and query the data such that </p>  <pre><code>counter_value &lt; threshold value </code></pre>  <p>Now in cassandra, indexes cannot be made on counters, that is something that is a problem, is there a workaround modelling which can be done to accomplish something similar??</p>  <p>thanks</p>
