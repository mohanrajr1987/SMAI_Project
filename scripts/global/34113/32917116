<p>Ive tried a lot of things to get this fixed but it always seems to result in one or the other error.</p>  <p>Below is my code that i am using to execute the INSERT query.</p>  <pre><code>            req.client.execute("INSERT INTO users (id,username,email,password,userFolder) VALUES (now(),'"+newUser.username+"','"+newUser.email+"','"+newUser.password+"',"+newUser.userFolder+");",function(err,result){             if(err){                 console.log(err.message)             }else{                 console.log("New user created")             }         }); </code></pre>  <p>The newUser.userFolder is simply defined in an array as <code>new Date().getTime()</code></p>  <p>ive tried doing <code>parseInt(userFolder: new Date().getTime());</code> but it always seems to result in either this error</p>  <p>Also if you try <code>Number(userFolder :new Data().getTime());</code> it also does not work and results in the second error below;</p>  <p>Another thing i tried was simply typing <code>newUser.userFolder.valueOf()</code> which also results in the second error.</p>  <pre><code>Invalid STRING constant (1443827057269) for "userfolder" of type int </code></pre>  <p>or </p>  <pre><code>Unable to make int from '1443827264655' </code></pre>  <p>I have a feeling because the ' is before the number is causing this. However im not sure how to remove this.</p>  <p>I tried directly typing the number without using the array and it works fine, so the variable must be causing this issue.</p>  <p>Im basically moving from MySQL to cassandra and have a deadline for this project so any help would be appreciated.</p>  <p>By the way im using datastax driver for node-js</p>
