<p>WIth multi data center, do we have a option where the consistency can be tuned to check the latest data in both the data centers before fetching data? like one, quorom or All is specific to data center. Can we do the same to check consistency of the data in both data centers? If we have replication factor 3 and 3 for both data centers. Does each_quorum solve this issue or we have consistency level ALL where it checks consistency in 6 nodes in both dcs'?</p>
