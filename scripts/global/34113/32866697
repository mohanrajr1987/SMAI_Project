<p>I am new to cassandra and was going through the triggers implementation. I wanted to implement triggers so as to update a table with old values of the tables that has been modified. suppose i have a table say test_table in keyspace keyspace1. i also have a table say table_track in the same keyspace with columns columnname and columnvalue. now when a row is updated in test_table, i would like to populate the track_table with row data(in test_table before update query was executed)  in to the columns columnname and columnvalue respectively.</p>  <p>i couldn't find any proper documentation regarding cassandra triggers anywhere. i managed to somehow implement InvertedIndex and some minor examples</p>  <pre><code>public Collection&lt;Mutation&gt; augment(ByteBuffer key, ColumnFamily update) {     List&lt;Mutation&gt; mutations = new ArrayList&lt;Mutation&gt;(update.getColumnCount());      for (Cell cell : update)     {         // Skip the row marker and other empty values, since they lead to an empty key.         if (cell.value().remaining() &gt; 0)         {             Mutation mutation = new Mutation(properties.getProperty("keyspace"), cell.value());             mutation.add(properties.getProperty("columnfamily"), cell.name(), key, System.currentTimeMillis());             mutations.add(mutation);         }     }      return mutations; } </code></pre>  <p>how can i modify the augment method to implement the functionality. Tnx</p>
