<p>I want data to be replicated across 4 machines.</p>  <p>3 of them are servers hosted in datacenter and there is one development machine which can be offline when development is not being done.</p>  <p>The 3 datacenter servers will be the Primary source for all data. the dev machine will not be the primary source for any data. But it will have all data of the other 3 machines. </p>  <p>When the dev machine goes online, it would sync with the other nodes and after that all queries from dev environment will run on Cassandra instance in the dev machine. Or atleast, I think, I'll get the quickest response from the local machine.</p>  <p>If possible, even when the dev machine is not connected to the internet, I want to be able to run queries (read only ones) against Cassandra instance on the dev machine.</p>
