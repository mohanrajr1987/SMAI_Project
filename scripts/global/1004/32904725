<p>as you know Android 5 add a background color to old apps. Newest apps are able to set a background color for their icons. I'm using API Level 19 (Android 4.4.2) and here is how i set the icon for my app:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;application     android:allowBackup="true"     android:icon="@drawable/ic_launcher"     android:label="@string/app_name"     android:theme="@style/AppTheme" &gt;     ... </code></pre>  <p>Does exist any way to set the background color to my application for users that use it on Android 5.x phones?</p>  <p>On my phone (Android 5.1.1) the background color for my app is white (why white?), but today i make some edits and fixes to the code of my app (nothing related to colors) and now the background color of the app icon is orange! What could have changed it?</p>  <p>Anyway do you know a way to set that color?</p>
