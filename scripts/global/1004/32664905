<p>Android has material design icons available now, but I don't want to change all of the icons yet (I think the android studio project I'm working on started BEFORE lollipop). Because of that though, I can't really seem to use Asset Studio to make my icons look like the android studio default icons, since the icons I have aren't really solid color. How can I mimic this? I've experimented with alpha and I at least figured out the size.</p>  <p>Android's icons and my own:</p>  <p><img src="https://github.com/Fire3galaxy/animated-bear/blob/master/android%20VS%20me.PNG?raw=true" alt="Android Studio&#39;s ic_menu_share and my special icon"> <img src="https://github.com/Fire3galaxy/animated-bear/blob/master/scroll_icon.png?raw=true" alt="my raw icon"></p>
