<p>i am completely new to this, but i was not able to find anything about it. In order to make my applications main icon use the native resolution of a specific iOS device, a lot of different image resolutions are required and need to be loaded. This is also applicable for LaunchImages. </p>  <p>What I am missing is:  What about the icons used within the application? How do i handle the resolution of this icons and how are they set properly?</p>  <p>Thank you in advance!</p>
