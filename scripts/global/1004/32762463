<p>Since Windows 10 the Icons in the taskbar seems to have a size of 24x24px. This would be no problem, if Windows would choose the 24px version in an icon file for display. But it choose the 32px version and scales it down. That results in ugly artifacts, especially if you have striaght lines in your icons. Is this a core windows problem or are there any known workarounds? Tested with a plain WinForms (C#) application and a Delphi Application.</p>
