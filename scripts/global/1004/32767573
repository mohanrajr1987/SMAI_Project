<p>TortoiseSVN overlay icons disappeared in FreeCommander after installing latest 1.9.2.26806-x64 version. Works fine in explorer however. Worked fine FreeCommander with 1.8.10. Removing/reinstalling/restarting/repairing/downgrade (now fails to show even with 1.8.10 version) does not help. How to fix this?</p>
