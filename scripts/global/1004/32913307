<p>I made my icons using Inkscape following the size guidelines. They looked normal sizes on couple devices. But I wanted to make the corners rounded and I used Android Studio Assets to accomplish that. Even though, the sizes are still accurate they now look smaller on the phones? What is causing that? Has anyone run into the same problems, if so how did you resolve it? I checked SO questions and answers this morning and none of them gave me solution.</p>
