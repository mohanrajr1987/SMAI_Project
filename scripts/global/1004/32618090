<p>I just added my personal website <a href="http://oatmeeel.com/" rel="nofollow">http://oatmeeel.com/</a> to my Linkedin. It appears that there is no thumbnail/icon showing on my LinkedIn (<a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/pub/oat-wongsajjathiti/63/55b/967" rel="nofollow">https://ca.linkedin.com/pub/oat-wongsajjathiti/63/55b/967</a>)</p>  <p>How do I add some sort of an image (like favicon) to any links to my website from other websites. Sorry if I'm being unclear. Here is an image of my issue.</p>  <p>Thank you <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ysCLJ.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ysCLJ.jpg" alt="Screenshot of my Linkedin"></a></p>
