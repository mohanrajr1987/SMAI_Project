<p>Since the introduction of the Design Support Library by Android, Tabs can be created more easily but when the Tabs uses icons only and not text titles it seems like there is no simple way to customize the icons with using some external library.</p>  <p>How can I customize the new Tab Layout(Not Sliding Tab Layout) icons to make them turn white(highlighted) when that tab is selected? Also how can I change the color of the selector? </p>
