<p>I'm working on an support application for patients with a highly <strong>stigmatized</strong> <strong>chronic illness</strong>, where the risk of <strong>disclosure</strong> is high.</p>  <p>So I was wondering if it's feasible to add a feature that enables the user to change the way the application <strong>icon</strong> looks on a <strong>mobile</strong> desktop. </p>  <p>For example: User downloads the mobile app, during initial application setup they get promoted to upload a png or choose from a predefined set.</p>
