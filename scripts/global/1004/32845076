<p>So I, like all of you have a menubar (header) on top of my website and recently found out how to use icons.</p>  <p>Now What I need is a menu wich at first shows ONLY the Icons and when you hover over the text (e.g. HOME, SHOP, etc.) shows up to the right of the icon.</p>  <p>Any way to to this with css?</p>  <p>Thx!</p>
