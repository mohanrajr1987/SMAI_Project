<p>Bear with me here, as I've just finished building my first little app, and I'm a little fresh to all this.</p>  <p>I use Visual Studio's built-in publishing function to generate a nice <code>.exe</code> file, however, I'm not liking the icon it provides me with for my fresh application. I wish to change this, and after a little googling, it was concluded that double-clicking <code>Properties</code> under my project in the <code>Solution Explorer</code> would bring me to a window where I could specify my used resources.</p>  <p>However, it looked like this:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/658DK.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/658DK.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>As you can see, the <code>Icon</code> selection is grayed out. After a little more googling, I was told it was because I had my own <code>Resources</code> folder, which I had already put resources in. And I do:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/lcjru.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/lcjru.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>However, I do wish to be able to set an icon for my newly published application anyway. One that will add some personal flare and style to my little double-clickable <code>.exe</code> file.</p>  <p>How would I go about doing that now that my <code>Icon</code> selection has been grayed out in my <code>Properties</code> view?</p>
