<p>I'm coding in vb.net on windows 10 (not sure if the OS is important or not). I would like to ask a question about BetterListView Express.</p>  <p>On my list I'm putting an Icon then the filename. Problem is, the filename is way to far to the right. Does anyone know how to get the filename just to the right of the icon?</p>  <p>Here's a snippet:</p>  <pre><code>exeIcon = Drawing.Icon.ExtractAssociatedIcon(exePath)  imgList.ImageSize = New Size(16, 16)  With imgList.Images     .Add(exePath, exeIcon)     .Add(imgList.Images(0)) End With  With blist.Items     .Add(imgList.Images(0))     .Add(p.ProcessName) End With </code></pre>  <p>I can tell from the code that the process name is going to be on separate line. I just don't know how to put them on the same line. Any help appreciated!</p>
