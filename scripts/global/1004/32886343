<p>Please consider the icons bellow.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/iz2Vt.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/iz2Vt.png" alt="Icons"></a></p>  <p>Thats a screeshot of my Android 5.0 phone. On my 4.4.4 phone, the icon to the right (MOVE-ME) has a transparent background. The icon is symply the colorful ring with a transparent hole. Also on my 4.4.4 the WhatsApp icon is symply the "talk baloon", withough the green background around it. My app icon has a symilar style as the "MOVE-ME" one, and the same happens, the system "fills" the transparent parts of the icon so it becomes the same shape of all the others. I'm guessing that is the reason WhatsApp added the green background, to prevent this from happening. And this leads me to my questions. 1) What is the standard shape for Android 5.0 launcher icons? 2) How can I choose icons depending on the Android API of the device? (Like WhatsApp)</p>
