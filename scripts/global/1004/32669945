<p>I have an unknown desktop icon or image that, after a few hours of up time appears on my windows 10 desktop and floats to the top over all video.  It's similar to the caps lock/lock off in formatting but I can't tell where it's from.  The laptop is a Lenovo W520 i7 16GB ram.  Upgraded from Win7 64 bit Pro.  I'd love to have uploaded and shown the icon but this system doesn't allow me to.  It looks like a semi-circle with the curved face pointing down and rays (lines) projecting from the curved face downward also (think of a child's drawing of the sun) with a slash line through it like some feature is shut off.  But what?</p>
