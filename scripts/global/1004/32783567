<p>Just bought a laptop (zenbook ux302lg 1920x1080) and installed windows 8.1 on  it and I came across the problem in android studio and eclipse.</p>  <p>Icons and font got really bad scaling and are very small. Although I manage to do something about font (in settings) I just can't find any good solution for icons... </p>  <p>Any gurus in here that know how to fix it ?</p>
