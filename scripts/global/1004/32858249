<p>I've made an Java app that uses URL based images instead of file based images. My question is, is there a way to get a URL image into an icon image?</p>  <pre><code>frame.setIconImage(new ImageIcon("icon.png").getImage()); </code></pre>  <p>That's how i would usually do an icon image but i tried:</p>  <pre><code>frame.setIconImage(new ImageIcon("i.imgur.com/&lt;whatever&gt;").getImage()); </code></pre>  <p>and it didn't seem to work, so is there a way to to it or is there atleast a way to get rid of the icon altogether without using a blank texture file?</p>
