<p>when trying to change App icon on Foursquare, I'm receiving this message in Chorme console:</p>  <pre><code>POST https://foursquare.com/__uploadappicon 400 (Bad Request)  Uncaught SecurityError: Failed to read the 'contentDocument' property from 'HTMLIFrameElement': Blocked a frame with origin "https://foursquare.com" from accessing a frame with origin "https://foursquare.com". The frame requesting access set "document.domain" to "foursquare.com", but the frame being accessed did not. Both must set "document.domain" to the same value to allow access. </code></pre>  <p>Here's screenshot:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/CV9Kl.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/CV9Kl.png" alt="Foursquare issue"></a></p>  <p>Does anybody got a solution for that? I've already twitted to @4sqSupport. </p>
