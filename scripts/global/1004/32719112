<p>When I set a break point on a row which already has a marker(The value of the local variable is not used) on it, I cannot see the break point marker; because the yellow lamp marker covers the break point marker.</p>  <p>Is it possible to change the priority of the markers so that the break point sits on top of the lamp marker?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/6uSNk.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/6uSNk.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
