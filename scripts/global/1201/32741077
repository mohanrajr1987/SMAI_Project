<p>I am trying to add a Get() function in a MVC 6 (Asp .Net 5) Web Api to pass a configuration option as a query string. Here are the two functions that I already have:</p>  <pre><code>[HttpGet] public IEnumerable&lt;Project&gt; GetAll() {     //This is called by http://localhost:53700/api/Project }  [HttpGet("{id}")] public Project Get(int id) {     //This is called by http://localhost:53700/api/Project/4 }  [HttpGet()] public dynamic Get([FromQuery] string withUser) {     //This doesn't work with http://localhost:53700/api/Project?withUser=true     //Call routes to first function 'public IEnumerable&lt;Project&gt; GetAll() } </code></pre>  <p>I've tried several different ways to configure the routing, but MVC 6 is light on documentation. What I really need is a way to pass some configuration options to the list of Projects for sorting, custom filtering etc.</p>
