<p>I am new to ROR and I am trying to added a new method to my controller but I am not able resolve it. Following is the new method in the controller:</p>  <pre><code>    def bulkItemsUpload     respond_to do |format|       options = { col_sep: ',', converters: :numeric, headers: true }       array = []       CSV.foreach(params[:file].path, options) do |row|         array.push(row.to_hash)       end       logger.debug "Parsed items: #{array.inspect}"       format.html { redirect_to companies_path }       format.js  { render json: JSON.pretty_generate(array) }     end   end </code></pre>  <p>Following is the existing route for the controller:</p>  <pre><code>resources :projects, except: :show do     collection do       get :search       get :look_for_name       # post :bulkItemsUpload     end      member do       patch "/archive/:archive", constraints: {archive: /true|false/}, action: :archive, as: :archive     end     match "/timesheet", to: "timesheets#show", via: [:get, :post], as: :timesheet     match "/items", to: "items#show", via: [:get, :post], as: :items     match "/search_reports", to: "reports#index", via: [:post], as: :search_reports      resources :reports, except: :destroy     resource :email_permissions, only: [:new, :create]      resources :project_workers, only: [:destroy, :update] do             resources :worked_hours, only: [:update]     end     resources :project_items, only: [:destroy, :update] do       resources :used_items, only: [:update]     end   end </code></pre>  <p>I added bulkItemsUpload entry in the route file but still can't resolve it. Any idea what I am doing wrong?</p>
