<p>This question is actually consisted of <strong>2</strong> questions.</p>  <p><strong>One being</strong> how can I create a certain amount of routes, but all other routes call one HTML page (basically, I want Symfony2 to take in certain URL's, but everything else is being left to AngularJS).</p>  <pre><code>get_user:     path:     /api/getuser     defaults: { _controller: AcmeDemoBundle:Api:GetUser } create_user:     path:     /api/createuser     defaults: { _controller: AcmeDemoBundle:Api:CreateUser } ... other:     path      [[ what to put in? ]]     defaults: { _controller: AcmeDemoBundle:Main:GetPage } </code></pre>  <p>Any url afterwards, angular should take in with <code>ngRoute</code>, through the backends <code>other</code> route.</p>  <p>Now the <strong>second question</strong> I have is, is it possible to restrict all routes (<code>get_user</code>, <code>create_user</code>...), except for the <code>other</code> route for any kind of call that isn't AJAX? For those who know ASP.NET, I want the result of naming a file <code>_file.cshtml</code> (you can't access it directly, but only through AJAX calls)</p>
