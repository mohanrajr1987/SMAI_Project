<p>I have two linux VPS servers with one "public" network interface each. I want to route all http traffic going out from Server 1 through the proxy serving on Server 2 (on port 8080). </p>  <p>I don`t want to configure the client applications on Server 1, rather I want to use networking magic to make it work in general for all applications making request with destination port 80.</p>  <p>How do I do this?</p>
