<p>From all ways to create multilingual sites, I have picked 3, that I consider that are the most used.</p>  <p><strong>1) www.example.com/en/about</strong></p>  <p>With this way, you only change the lang prefix, but the slug is the same, so if I change to spanish, the url is: <strong>www.example.com/es/about</strong>.</p>  <p><strong>2) en.example.com/about</strong></p>  <p>If every language is hosted in a subdomain, you have different versions of your app. It means more flexibility, but it has a cost.</p>  <p><strong>3) www.example.com/about -> www.example.com/acerca-de-nosotros</strong></p>  <p>The url changes in every language.</p>  <p><strong>THE QUESTION</strong></p>  <p>Which way is the best standard to use, to have a good SEO and a good user experience?</p>  <p>Thank you very much.</p>
