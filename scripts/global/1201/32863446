<p>I'm currently looking for some good techniques to anonymously send and receive messages and/or files over the internet. Currently I'm only really familiar with tor which is based on Onion routing.</p>  <p>I found another technique called AntsP2P (<a href="http://antsp2p.altervista.org/" rel="nofollow">http://antsp2p.altervista.org/</a>) which is based on Antnet (<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~gianni/antnet.html" rel="nofollow">http://people.idsia.ch/~gianni/antnet.html</a>). I can't really figure out how that technique provides anonimity though.</p>  <p>Anyway.. Are there some good alternatives to onion routing when it comes to anonymously sending messages and/or files over the internet?</p>  <p>Thnx in advance!</p>
