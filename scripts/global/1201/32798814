<p>I don't really know if it's ok to use word 'gate' in this situation, but here is what i want to achieve:</p>  <p>I want to filter all outcoming HTTP requests and extract some data from filtered requests. In order to do this i want to send all traffic through my PC which will act like a proxy. HTTP requests will be filtered and sent further, all non-HTTP requests will be sent further without filtering, to their destination. </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/VQldO.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/VQldO.png" alt="scheme"></a></p>  <p>Is it possible to achieve this with node.js ?</p>
