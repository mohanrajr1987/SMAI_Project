<p>Simple question. </p>  <p>I'm building an Express web application with two views/routes (controlled by Angular): </p>  <p>localhost:3000/#/join</p>  <p>localhost:3000/#/find</p>  <p>I want the initial "localhost:3000" to forward to "localhost:3000/#/join", but currently, the page only loads the generic static content and does not include the unique html partial content associated with the view. </p>  <p>I'm using the following code. </p>  <pre><code>require('./app/routes.js')(app);  app.all('*', function(req, res){     res.redirect('/#/join'); }); </code></pre>  <p>The forwarding works correctly for all url (e.g. localhost:3000/blah, localhost:3000/blah2, etc.) -- except for the initial localhost:3000.</p>  <p>Any suggestions?</p>
