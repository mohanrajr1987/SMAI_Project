<p>I'm trying to add auto start download to my asp.net mvc site. </p>  <p>Physical download file is in domain/content/downloads folder, and Razor view is domain/Downloads/Index.</p>  <p>When i add  <code>&lt;META HTTP-EQUIV="Refresh" CONTENT="10;URL=~/Content/Downloads/setup.rar"&gt;</code> line to my header, server create <code>/Downloads/~/Content/Downloads/setup.rar</code>. </p>  <p>Can someone point me how to solve this? I would like to avoid adding full download links in header if posible.</p>
