<p>I have a situation that I don't know how to resolve. </p>  <p>I have a Mikrotik RB750GL Mini-Router that sits connected to my WAN, and has one LAN port connected to a Netgear wireless router.</p>  <p>The Mikrotik is on the 192.168.88.x subnet, while the Netgear wireless router is on the 192.168.1.1 subnet. </p>  <p>A device that is connected to the Netgear router can ping a device that is connected to the Mikrotik router. </p>  <p>Any device that is connected to the Mikrotik router cannot reach devices on the Netgear router. Using ping, I get a Destination net unreachable. Using traceroute I see that the device on the Mikrotik router gets to the router, but then the next hop is outside in the Internet. </p>  <p>I'm sure that I need to add something to the routing table in the Mikrotik, but I am not familar with the web interface and need help with this. Any suggestions?</p>
