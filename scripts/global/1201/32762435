<p>I'm quite new to OWIN as a technology.  I have a service, and my routing looks something like this:</p>  <pre><code>[Route("myMessage/{message}")] [AcceptVerbs("GET", "POST")] [HttpPost] public void myMessage(string message) </code></pre>  <p>I have installed the service like this:</p>  <pre><code>installutil My.Service.exe </code></pre>  <p>And checked that the service is running under Windows (8).</p>  <p>However, when I try navigating to this URI <code>http://localhost:1010/myMessage/test</code></p>  <p>I get a 404 error.  Is there a way to debug or view whether this is correctly running (for example, in IIS I could select browse)?</p>
