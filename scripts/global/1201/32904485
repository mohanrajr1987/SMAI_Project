<p>I'm writing my first serious MEAN application and have a problem with my routing. The basic setup works, I have a bunch of GET and POST routes that work perfectly. I ran into this problem trying to serve a static html file <code>somepage.html</code>for the route <code>GET /somepage/:uuid</code>.</p>  <p>In <strong>app.js</strong>:</p>  <pre><code>app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public'))); var routes = require('./routes/index'); app.use('/', routes); </code></pre>  <p>In <strong>routes/index.js</strong>:</p>  <pre><code>router.get('/somepage/:uuid', function (req, res) {   res.sendFile('public/somepage.html', {root: __dirname + "/.."}); }); </code></pre>  <p>What happens is that that the html file is loaded, but all loading of static resources take the wrong path. I expect it to load script.js from <code>public/script.js</code> but it tries to fetch it at <code>somepage/script.js</code></p>  <p>What did I miss?</p>  <p>P.S. What I'm really trying to achieve is to pass that <code>uuid</code> between pages. At page one, an angular controller has the <code>uuid</code> and the controller at somepage.html should also be aware of it. Is there a better way than passing it in the url? The server doesn't need to know the uuid.</p>
