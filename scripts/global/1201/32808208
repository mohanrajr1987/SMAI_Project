<p>I am trying to design a bus routes based on 2 objectives:</p>  <ol> <li><p>minimize total distance of the route </p></li> <li><p>minimize total in-vehicle time for passengers</p></li> </ol>  <p>The bus route will involve picking passengers up at a single stop then dropping them off at subsequent bus stops. Hence, the stops where most people are dropping off should be served first in order to meet objective 2. It need not be the shortest route possible but the best choice among the two objectives. </p>  <p>Does anyone knows how can I go about doing it? </p>
