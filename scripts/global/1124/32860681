<p>My application contains an index.html page that looks as follows:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html ng-app="MyExample"&gt;  &lt;head&gt; &lt;meta charset="utf-8" /&gt;  &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt;     &lt;div ng-view&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; </code></pre>  <p>The ng-view div is then filled with different pages I store in another folder. As I am writing for a german speaking audience, I need to include special characters like ä, ö, or ü. However, these characters are only rendered correctly if written somewhere within the index.html page. As soon as they are to be displayed somewhere in a nested page of the ng-view div, they are represented as &lt; ? >. It seems as if the utf-8 encoding is not passed on to the nested html files. I made sure the html files are also utf-8 encoded (I'm using eclipse for development and simply changed the properties of the file to utf-8). Does anybody know anything about this or how to solve it?</p>
