<p>I am supporting a migration from MSSQL to Postgres. I am just the guy in the middle, and don't have actual access to the MSSQL server, which doesn't make things easier. I was able to persuade the MSSQL people to do an SQL export (instead of a .bak file), and already know how to deal with MS-specific weirdness in the file. However, the file also has a whole bunch of junk characters at the end of each line, like so:</p>  <pre><code> INSERT [dbo].[Client_Balances] ([client_id], [Total Invoices], [Total Debits], [Total Payments], [Total Credits], [Balance Forward]) VALUES (N'D0000006492', CAST(0.00 AS Decimal(38, 2)), CAST(0.00 AS Decimal(38, 2)), CAST(0.00 AS Decimal(38, 2)), CAST(0.00 AS Decimal(38, 2)), CAST(0.00 AS Decimal(38, 2)))਍䤀一匀䔀刀吀 嬀搀戀漀崀⸀嬀䌀氀椀攀渀琀开䈀愀氀愀渀挀攀猀崀 ⠀嬀挀氀椀攀渀琀开&gt;椀搀崀Ⰰ 嬀吀漀琀愀氀 䤀渀瘀漀椀挀攀猀崀Ⰰ 嬀吀漀琀愀氀 䐀攀戀椀琀猀崀Ⰰ 嬀吀漀琀愀氀 倀愀礀洀攀渀琀猀崀Ⰰ 嬀吀漀琀愀氀 䌀爀攀搀椀琀猀崀Ⰰ 嬀䈀愀氀愀渀挀攀 䘀漀爀眀愀爀搀崀⤀ 嘀䄀䰀唀䔀匀 ⠀一✀䐀　　     　　　㄀㄀㐀㌀　✀Ⰰ 䌀䄀匀吀⠀㈀㠀　⸀　　 䄀匀 䐀攀挀椀洀愀氀⠀㌀㠀Ⰰ ㈀⤀⤀Ⰰ 䌀䄀匀吀⠀　⸀　　 䄀匀 䐀攀挀椀洀愀氀⠀㌀㠀Ⰰ ㈀⤀⤀Ⰰ 䌀䄀匀吀⠀㌀㄀㐀⸀　　 䄀匀 䐀攀挀椀洀愀氀⠀㌀㠀Ⰰ ㈀⤀⤀Ⰰ 䌀䄀匀吀⠀　⸀　　 䄀匀      䐀攀挀椀洀愀氀⠀㌀㠀Ⰰ ㈀⤀⤀Ⰰ 䌀䄀匀吀⠀ⴀ㌀㐀⸀　　 䄀匀 䐀攀挀椀洀愀氀⠀㌀㠀Ⰰ ㈀⤀⤀⤀ഀ </code></pre>  <p>Any ideas on how to clean this up directly in the text .sql file? Manual is not an option - the file contains 13.1 million lines. The characters aren't all the same, either, so I can't figure it out - can I write a regex that includes all of these? </p>
