<p>This might be a bit beginner question but it's fairly relevant considering debbuging encoding in Java: <strong>At what point is an encoding being relevant to a String object?</strong></p>  <p>Consider I have a String object that I want to save to a file. Is the String object itself using some sort of encoding I should manipulate or this encoding will only be informed by me <strong>when I create a stream of bytes to save</strong>?</p>  <p>The same applies to importing: when I open a file and get it's bytes, I assume there's no encoding at hand, only bytes. When I parse this bytes to a String, I got to use an encoding to understand what characters are they. <strong>After I parse those bytes</strong>, the String (in memory) has some sort of meta information with the encoding or this is only being handled by the JVM?</p>  <p>This is vital considering I'm having file import/export issues and I got to understand at which point I should worry about getting the right encoding.</p>  <p>Hope I explained my doubt well, and thank you in advance!</p>
