<p>Is it possible to specify an encoding like utf-8 instead of us-ascii?</p>  <p>Using HMAC-SHA1 in Paw I'll always get a warning like this:</p>  <p>HMAC Signature cannot encode " /sevices/cdn" using us-ascii encoding</p>  <p>Maybe it's related to the requirement to include newlines within the text to be signed. (I use Ctrl-Enter to get this).</p>  <p>It works, but is there a better way to avoid this warning?</p>  <p>Thanks Stephan</p>
