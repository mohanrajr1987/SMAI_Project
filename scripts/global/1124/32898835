<p>I want to encode a file using <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/uu.html" rel="nofollow">uu.encode()</a> method and use the encoded text in the script. For this I have to write that output to a file, by default uu.encode(input_file, output_file) requires the output file name so that it can write the encoded text to that file, then read the file to store in a variable.</p>  <p>But I don't want to do this and store the encoded text directly into a variable. Is it possible?</p>  <p>Here is the typical usage of uu.encode:</p>  <pre><code>import uu uu.encode("myfile.exe", "encoded_exe.txt") </code></pre>  <p>I tried some stupid moves like this, which took me nowhere.</p>  <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; data = uu.encode("M8510-8681-2015-09-29-220157.flv", sys.stdout.read()) Traceback (most recent call last):   File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; IOError: File not open for reading &gt;&gt;&gt; </code></pre>  <p>This is not a must-requirement for me, but want to learn a thing or two using this opportunity. </p>
