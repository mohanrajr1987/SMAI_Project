<p>So this code works until you decide to hit <code>Cancel</code> or close the inputbox window with the X at which point it gives you:</p>  <p>Run-time error '424':</p>  <p>Object required</p>  <p>and then it highlights this part of the code in debug:</p>  <p><code>Set ranC = Application.InputBox("Select the Cal B table.", Type:=8)</code></p>  <p>I can't seem to use the zero string length string test for canceling with this application.  I need to be able to close the current workbook, show a userform and exit the sub.</p>  <p>Here is my code: (the code works as long as you select something and don't cancel or close)</p>  <pre><code>Sub popCheckVals() Dim ranC As Range, calBC(1 To 39) As Variant, i As Integer, j As Integer, k As Integer, l As Integer dozerCal.Hide  Set ranC = Application.InputBox("Select the Cal B table.", Type:=8)  l = 1 For j = 1 To 13     For i = 1 To 3         calBC(l) = ranC(j, i)         l = l + 1     Next Next  mltn = calBC(1)  mlte = calBC(2)  mltelev = calBC(3)  rltn = calBC(4)  rlte = calBC(5)  rltelev = calBC(6)  mrtn = calBC(10)  mrte = calBC(11)  mrtelev = calBC(12)  rrtn = calBC(13)  rrte = calBC(14)  rrtelev = calBC(15)  smltn = calBC(22)  smlte = calBC(23)  smltelev = calBC(24)  srltn = calBC(25)  srlte = calBC(26)  srltelev = calBC(27)  smrtn = calBC(31)  smrte = calBC(32)  smrtelev = calBC(33)  srrtn = calBC(34)  srrte = calBC(35)  srrtelev = calBC(36)      ActiveWorkbook.Close     dozerCal.Show End If End Sub </code></pre>
