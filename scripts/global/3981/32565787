<p>Sometimes when I open Excel I got a run time 1004 error message. Prompting that my add-in (xlam) file could not be saved because it is read only. That is annoying because I never know when its is going to happen and what is causing the problem. </p>  <p>This is the piece of code executed when the add-in is open:</p>  <pre><code>Private Sub Workbook_Open()  'I initialize some variables configurado = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets("Registro").Range("a1") proxyObrigatorio = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets("Registro").Range("a2") ipProxy = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets("Registro").Range("a3") portaProxy = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets("Registro").Range("a4")    'I insert the xlam's name in the G1 range and save the xlam file fileName = ThisWorkbook.Name ThisWorkbook.Worksheets("Calculos").Range("G1") = fileName      End Sub  </code></pre>  <p>What could be possible causing the problem?</p>
