<p>So I have a sub that gets 3 integer values passed onto it, it creates an array with 3 different formulas which are then used one by one in different cells in excel.</p>  <p>Code:</p>  <pre><code>Private Sub SOB_Measurements_X(ByVal Position As Integer, ByVal RowNumber As Integer, ByVal ColumnNumber As Integer)      Dim i As Integer     Dim Formula1 As Variant      Dim Start     Start = Array("=AVERAGE(IF(Delta (outer)!B1:CZ1=Test_Summary!E8, Delta (outer)!B", "=AVERAGE(IF(height (inner)!B1:CZ1=Test_Summary!E8, height (inner)!B", "=AVERAGE(IF(height (outer)!B1:CZ1=Test_Summary!E8, height (outer) height!B")      Dim Mid As String: Mid = ":CZ"     Dim End1 As String: End1 = "))"      For i = 0 To UBound(Start, 1)         Formula1 = Start(i) &amp; Position &amp; Mid &amp; Position &amp; End1         Cells(RowNumber + i, ColumnNumber).Select         ActiveCell.FormulaArray = Formula1     Next i  End Sub </code></pre>  <p>The array "Start" has 3 different formulas in it, which are stored in the variable Formula1 of type variant. Unfortunately, the above code gives me a run-time error "Unable to set the FormulaArray property of range class".</p>  <p>Thanks for your help!</p>
