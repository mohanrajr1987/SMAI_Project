<p>I have searched but can find no way to read PYZ files. I know they are a type of zip file, but I can not read them by way of a zip program.</p>  <p>This is in reference to another <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32669161/pyinstaller-windowserror-error-126-the-specified-module-could-not-be-found?noredirect=1#comment53189478_32669161">question</a> where I need access to the _init__ file inside a directory structure that is created by pyinstaller when attempting to build an exe. During this process, a out00-PYZ.pyz file is created, and the error references a file inside the PYZ.</p>  <p>The thread <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18303122/how-to-decompile-files-from-pyinstaller-pyz-file">here</a> describes how to decompile from an EXE to obtain PYC files, but doesn't work with PYZ files.</p>  <p>Surely there is someway to crack open this commonly used pythonic file?</p>  <p>Many thanks in advance.</p>
