<p>I recorded this macro to update the date range of 16 charts. But, as you can see I am getting a Run-time error. </p>  <p>I have looked at other threads on stackoverflow that relate to this but none come close. The darn help button on excel doesn't help either.  Can you please advise? Here is the code:</p>  <pre><code>ActiveSheet.ChartObjects("Chart 18").Activate ActiveChart.Axes(xlCategory).Select ActiveSheet.ChartObjects("Chart 18").Activate With ActiveSheet.PivotTables("PivotTable2").PivotFields("Date")     .PivotItems("Sep-15").Visible = False     .PivotItems("Aug-14").Visible = True End With </code></pre>
