<p>I am unable to run my android emulator. When I run the app I get the following in the console:</p>  <pre><code>/home/thom/Programs/android-sdk-linux/tools/emulator -avd Nexus_5_API_23 -netspeed full -netdelay none X Error of failed request:  BadAlloc (insufficient resources for operation)   Major opcode of failed request:  149 ()   Minor opcode of failed request:  2   Serial number of failed request:  35   Current serial number in output stream:  36 </code></pre>  <p>I've found many similar errors but I can't find a solution that applies to my error.</p>
