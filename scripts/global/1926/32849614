<p>I have a type <code>Foo</code> as follow:</p>  <pre><code>[Alias("Boo")] public class Foo {   public int Id { get; set; }   public string Name { get; set; } } </code></pre>  <p>I am saving the history of changes of the objects properties, and for performance reasons I would like to create a second table where to push all history. Unfortunately OrmLite does not support (afaik) multiple tables per type. The alias will simply be used instead of the type name when defined.</p>  <p>Since I am using generic data controllers, I need to <strong>clone the actual type</strong> <code>T</code> (with a different name <code>Boo</code>). I do not need to convert/cast objects between both types, but it would be helpful if that is possible as well.</p>
