<p>I have an array that contains numbers and empty strings, like <code>["", "2", "4", "", "", "1", "2", ""]</code>. I would like to pare this down to a list of numbers, like <code>[2,4,1,2]</code>.</p>  <p>My first effort split this into two steps, first strip out the empty strings, then do the string-to-integer conversion. However, my code for step one isn't working as desired.</p>  <pre><code>for (index,value) in tempArray.enumerate(){     if value == ""  {         tempArray.removeAtIndex(index)     } } </code></pre>  <p>This fails, I believe because it is using the index values from the original, complete array, though after the first deletion they are not longer accurate.</p>  <p>What would be a better way to accomplish my goal, and what is the best way to convert the resulting array of integer strings to an array of integers?</p>
