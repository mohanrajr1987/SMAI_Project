<p>For example; "Console class"  "Acme.Collections.Stack class" </p>  <p>One says, the precise term should be a "class".  Of course, the term "type" can be used because it is a general term.</p>  <p>In my opinion, "class" is not correct. "class" should be used only for user_defined types. Consle, Stack are not custom ones so it should be "types".</p>  <p>The MSDN says like this; A class is a construct that enables you to create your own custom types by grouping together variables of other types, methods and events. </p>  <p>Any good suggestions ?</p>
