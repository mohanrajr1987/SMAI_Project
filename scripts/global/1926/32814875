<p>We are converting a program written for MySQL to use SQLite. Some of the code adapts automatically to the type of fields we get back from the database. SQLite has the "interesting" property of present the SQL SUM(...) function as ftWideString (presumably to handle possible overflow). We need these fields to be integer or float fields. I tried this, which seems to obvious compel the SQL to give you the type you need:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT cast(sum(units) as int) FROM dr02 </code></pre>  <p>but the type is still ftWideString.</p>  <p>How can I make it return an ftInteger or ftLargeInt, or ftFloat, as required?</p>  <p>TIA Mark</p>
