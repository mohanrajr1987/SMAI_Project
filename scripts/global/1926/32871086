<p>I'm trying to learn more about Phantom Types. I'm trying to read through <a href="http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/ralf.hinze/publications/With.pdf">Fun with Phantom Types</a> by Ralf Hinze. He's using a keyword <code>with</code> I haven't seen before and that I can't get to compile. I get a parse error on <code>=</code> when I try this. </p>  <pre><code>data Type t = RInt                    with t = Int             | RChar                   with t = Char             | RList (Type a)          with t = [a ]             | RPair (Type a) (Type b) with t = (a, b) </code></pre>  <p>Earlier in the paper, he says that the "with" statements aren't strictly necessary, that you can set <code>a = t</code> instead, but I can't figure out how to define this data type without them. The following errors with: <code>Not in scope: type variable 'a'</code></p>  <pre><code>data Type t = RInt             | RChar             | RList (Type a)             | RPair (Type a) (Type b) </code></pre>  <p>What am I missing?</p>
