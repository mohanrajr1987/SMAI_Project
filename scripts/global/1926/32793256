<p>So I just had an argument with a friend about efficiently instantiating and declaring variables in Java; that argument ended in a stalemate, as neither of us could make a point that could not be equally fought, all of which summed to a matter of opinion. However, my questions are:</p>  <p>If I declare say 3 variables on the same line: <code>Object x,y,z;</code>, it is the same as declaring them on three separate lines: <code>Object x;</code> <code>Object y;</code> <code>Object z;</code>. However, is it more efficient to declare them all on one line?</p>  <p>If I declare 3 variables on the same line and instantiate them all simultaneously, are they all bound to the same Object/Value?: <code>Object x,y,z = new Object();</code> Or is x equal to a new instance of type <code>Object</code> as well as <code>y</code> and <code>z</code> equal to new instances of <code>Object</code>?</p>  <p>If I declare 3 variables on the same line and instantiate them all individually rather than do so on 3 separate lines, is it more efficient, or just a matter of opinion?: </p>  <pre><code>Object x = new Object(),y = new Object(),z = new Object(); </code></pre>
