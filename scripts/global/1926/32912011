<p>I would like to write a Java method which works for any type of numbers (doubles, int, long, etc.). How do I do that? </p>  <p>So for example if I want to write a method which calculates the average of a list and I want the methode to work for all types of number I would like to do something like:</p>  <pre><code>public static double average(T[] list){      double result = 0; //average will have decimal point       for(int i=0; i &lt; list.length; i++){          result += list[i];      }      return result/ (double) list.length; } </code></pre>  <p>where T can be any numerical type. </p>
