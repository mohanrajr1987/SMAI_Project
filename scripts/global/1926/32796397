<p>I have several classes that implement an <code>IExecutableCommand</code> interface in my assembly and want to group these into a list so I can perform operations on them.</p>  <p>This is my code so far.</p>  <pre><code>private IEnumerable&lt;IExecutableCommand&gt; _executableCommands;      public MainProgram()     {         var types = GetType().Assembly.GetTypes().Where(x =&gt; x.GetInterfaces().Contains(typeof(IExecutableCommand)) &amp;&amp; !x.IsInterface).ToList();     } </code></pre>  <p>The <code>types</code> variable contains the three classes in the assembly that implement the <code>IExecutableCommand</code> interface, as expected, but I don't know how to put these into my <code>_executableCommnds</code> list.</p>
