<p>I’m analyzing some weird program run time behaviour with <code>perf</code>, with some help on IRC. By default <code>perf stat</code> only lists a few counters, and not those of interest, so there is an annoying ping-pong of “include this counter in the output” and me adding it to the list of arguments passed via <code>-e</code> and pasting the result.</p>  <p>Is there a way to make <code>perf stat</code> simply emit all counters, so that one report is all the experts need to help me?</p>
