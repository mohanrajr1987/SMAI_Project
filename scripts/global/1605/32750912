<p>I would like to profile my parallel code (both mpi and omp)</p>  <p>I found out that Callgrind is very easy to use and analyze (using Kcachegrind) for serial code as it can give you the relative time spent on different functions.</p>  <p>What would it give me when running a parallel code?  Would it only monitor the master process or will it sum over all process?</p>  <p>Can it detect deadlocks or place where one process is waiting to another?</p>  <p>Is there a better tool to use when profiling a parallel code?</p>
