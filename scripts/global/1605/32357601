<p>I am developing an Android app which heavily uses NDK and also uses external shared libraries compiled from C++.</p>  <p>Those libraries contain various algorithms and I'd like to use profiling tools to boost performance of the code inside this library. Worth mentioning that I am building my C++ libraries with CMake.</p>  <p>Are there any tools for profiling that can be suitable for my case?</p>  <p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>  <p>Particularly, can I use <a href="https://github.com/richq/android-ndk-profiler" rel="nofollow">android-ndk-profiler</a> with my shared library?</p>
