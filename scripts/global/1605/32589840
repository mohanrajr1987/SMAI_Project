<p>I have a Java process and I start it (as suggested here : <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javacomponents/jmc-5-4/jfr-runtime-guide/run.htm" rel="nofollow">parameters for FR</a>) with the options :</p>  <p>-XX:+UnlockCommercialFeatures -XX:+FlightRecorder -XX:StartFlightRecording=duration=2m,filename=myflightrecord.jfr -XX:FlightRecorderOptions=maxsize=100k,maxage=1m</p>  <p>in order to have Flight Recorder information.</p>  <p>I would expect that the <strong>maxage=1m</strong> would give me only one minute of record, and <strong>maxsize=100k</strong> the file size wouldnt be larger than 100Kb, but none of them does work as expected.</p>  <p>Another problem that I encounter is that I want the file to be stored every amount of time, lets suppose every one minute. But the file "<strong>myflightrecord.jfr</strong>" is empty until the duration is reached (2minutes in the example). </p>  <p>Is there any way to make the Flight recorder flush before the end of the duration? </p>  <p>ps: The version of Java I am using is JDK1.8.0_45</p>
