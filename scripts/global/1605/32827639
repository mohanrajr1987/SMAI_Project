<p>I'm trying to profile a webservice from Visual Studio.  The webservice is VB.Net.  I go to <code>Analyze</code> -> <code>Performance and Diagnostics</code> from Visual Studio, and whether I start up the project or connect it to the already running webservice, it starts up the process, but when I go to the site (even just the .svc page) it returns a 503 and the profiling process ends.  Then the regular site comes back up and is available.</p>
