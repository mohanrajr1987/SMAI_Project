<p>For the same CUDA program, I get non-negligible differences in data transfer time for repeated runs. For example, the Device to Host and Host to Device times are as follows, platform is <strong>Kepler K20c</strong>, and the output is collected using <strong>nvprof</strong>.</p>  <pre><code>Run  1: DtoH: 193.88ms, HtoD: 49.31ms Run  2: DtoH: 168.57ms, HtoD: 49.32ms Run  3: DtoH: 194.38ms, HtoD: 49.30ms Run  4: DtoH: 167.21ms, HtoD: 49.32ms Run  5: DtoH: 166.81ms, HtoD: 49.34ms Run  6: DtoH: 166.63ms, HtoD: 49.31ms Run  7: DtoH: 166.42ms, HtoD: 49.32ms Run  8: DtoH: 166.12ms, HtoD: 62.43ms Run  9: DtoH: 166.20ms, HtoD: 49.33ms Run 10: DtoH: 178.95ms, HtoD: 49.30ms </code></pre>  <p>What is the best statistic to represent this data: mean, median, maximum time or any other?</p>
