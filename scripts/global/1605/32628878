<p>I have tried to profile my wpf application concentrating on non-visual parts that do some calculations and evaluations, I have used Visual Studio 2012 bulit in profiler. </p>  <p>There is quite a lot of code (tens of thousands of lines) in that application, so I was surprised that it showed 46.3% time spent on a single line:</p>  <pre><code>db.Entry(qzv.ZkouskaVzorku).Collection(p =&gt; p.VyhodnoceniZkouskies).Load(); </code></pre>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/2nuaj.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/2nuaj.png" alt="Profiler result"></a></p>  <p>This line should just explicitly load related entities <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/jj574232.aspx" rel="nofollow">as specified here</a>.</p>  <p>I have checked this line using SQL Express profiler and it showed only this SQL command:</p>  <pre><code>exec sp_executesql N'SELECT      [Extent1].[VyhodnoceniZkouskyID] AS [VyhodnoceniZkouskyID],      [Extent1].[Kontext] AS [Kontext],      [Extent1].[NormaVlastnostiID] AS [NormaVlastnostiID],      [Extent1].[ZkouskaVzorkuID] AS [ZkouskaVzorkuID],      [Extent1].[ZkouskaTypuID] AS [ZkouskaTypuID],      [Extent1].[JeShodaITT] AS [JeShodaITT],      [Extent1].[JeITT] AS [JeITT],      [Extent1].[JeStorno] AS [JeStorno]     FROM [dbo].[VyhodnoceniZkousky] AS [Extent1]     WHERE [Extent1].[ZkouskaVzorkuID] = @EntityKeyValue1',N'@EntityKeyValue1 int',@EntityKeyValue1=1816601 go </code></pre>  <p>And this command executes very quickly in 0 ms as it is just selecting several rows using primary clustered index.</p>  <p>Using Entity framework 6.1.0 with SQL Server LocalDB 2014. I have commented this line as it is important only for ViewModels and the calculations really work cca 2x faster.</p>  <p>What could be the issue and is there any workaround to fix it? </p>
