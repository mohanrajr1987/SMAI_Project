<p>I'd like to profile my application using callgrind. Now, since it takes a very long time, <strong>in the meanwhile</strong> I go on with web-browsing, compiling and other intensive tasks on the same machine.</p>  <p><strong>Am I biasing the profiling results?</strong> I'm expecting that, since valgrind uses a <em>simulated CPU</em>, other <em>external</em> processes should not interfere with valgrind execution. Am I right?</p>
