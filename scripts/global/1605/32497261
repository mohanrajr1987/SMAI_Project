<p>I have a performance critical application for OS X built with Delphi and I would like to profile it to see if there are any bottlenecks I can optimize.</p>  <p>However if I use XCode profiler then it cannot load the debug symbols generated by Delphi and therefore not display any useful information about my program.</p>  <p>Is there any other profiler tool for OS X that can read Delphi symbols?</p>  <p>Or is there a way to convert Delphi debug info (perhaps from .map-file) into a format XCode profiler can use? It seems XCode profiler expects DWARF format.</p>
