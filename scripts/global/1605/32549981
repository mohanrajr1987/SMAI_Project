<p>I am considering writing an application-specific sampling based profiler on linux. The ptrace API, if I understand the man page correctly, relies on instrumentation in the kernel that stops the tracee whenever certain events happen in the kernel.</p>  <p>Is there a way to read the instruction pointer of a thread (from another thread on another core) without stopping the process?  </p>
