<p>I understand that inline caching is helpful only when a particular accesses is repeatedly executed at the same location. It does not consider the accesses made seperately. </p>  <p>For example,<br> for(i=0;i&lt;1000;i++) obj.x;</p>  <p>Here Inline caching will be helpful since each access is made independently. But consider following </p>  <p>obj.x; obj.x; .... 1000 times..</p>  <p>In this case, inline caching is not helpful. Is that true?</p>  <p>If this is the case, what is the point of patching inline caching stub at locations/accesses which will not be repeated.</p>
