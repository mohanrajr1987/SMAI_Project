<p>I'm familiar with using nvprof to access the events and metrics of a benchmark, e.g.,     </p>  <pre><code>nvprof --system-profiling on --print-gpu-trace -o (file name) --events inst_issued1 ./benchmarkname </code></pre>  <p>The </p>  <pre><code>system-profiling on --print-gpu-trace -o (filename)     </code></pre>  <p>command gives timestamps for start time, kernel end times, power, temp and saves the info an nvvp files so we can view it in the visual profiler. This allows us to see what's happening in any section of a code, in particular when a specific kernel is running. My question is this--  </p>  <p>Is there a way to isolate the events counted for only a section of the benchmark run, for example during a kernel execution? In the command above, </p>  <pre><code>--events inst_issued1     </code></pre>  <p>just gives the instructions tallied for the whole executable. Thanks!</p>
