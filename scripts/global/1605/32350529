<p>I have multiple instances of same program running ,my situation demands that I should kill a specific instance of a program in case three instances are running I should  kill one of them. How should I achieve this? Is it possible to create profile names for each instance and kill one  by using that? If so How? or is there any other way I did lots of reading about this but could not.</p>
