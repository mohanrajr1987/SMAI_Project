<p>Suppose I am measuring the time it takes to execute a jQuery function such as:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;Start timer here&gt; $("#myImage").hide(); &lt;End timer here&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Within that timer code, does it include any reflows or repaints that occur as a result of calling that method? Or does that happen some time afterwards (i.e. a message gets posted to a queue and then gets executed later)? How can I measure how long the reflow/repaint is taking?</p>
