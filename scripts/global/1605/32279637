<p>I am profiling crucial loop in my app and I see interesting option in time profiler settings: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>"View as value"</p> </blockquote>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/7m4Ez.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/7m4Ez.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>When I select it, I see numbers with 'x' postfix instead of standard percentage values.</p>  <p>As an example, see attached screenshot (assembly code view):  <code>and</code> instruction has <code>442x</code> value. This btw seems heavy for such simple assembly instruction and comparing to others in the loop.</p>  <p>What do those numbers mean? Are those somehow referring to the CPU cycles for given line of code?</p>
