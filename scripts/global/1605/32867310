<p>Is there any way to profile JavaScript program to find out the number of times each function is invoked in the program?</p>  <p>Also, I want to see how much percentage of total execution time is spent on introducing inline cache in the program.  I am aware of v8 profiling tools which gives output similar to <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/MAKoU.png" rel="nofollow">http://i.stack.imgur.com/MAKoU.png</a>. What does the  percentage in brackets refer to? Does IC Miss(24.3%) means that 24.3% of the total execution time is spent on  inline caching? Then why does these percentages do not sum up to 100%.</p>
