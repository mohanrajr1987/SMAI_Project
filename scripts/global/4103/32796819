<p>I have a SQL Server database full of products I want to display on my page(ASP.NET).</p>  <p>I'm thinking about the best way to display the products, getting in consideration that in each page I have minimum 30-40 products (Title, Image, and other info about the product).</p>  <p>I was thinking about a gridview (customize it), what do you guys think?</p>  <p>What would be the best option?</p>  <p>Thank you very much, Peter</p>
