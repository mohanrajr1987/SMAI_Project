<p>I know this question is a lot like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3340192/datagridview-bound-to-bindinglist-does-not-refresh-when-value-changed">this other one</a>, but still I can't figure out the answer.</p>  <p>Thing is, my class <em>does</em> implement INotifyPropertyChanged, and my grid <em>does</em> update... just not right away.  The values kind-of update in "bursts" instead of real time as each one changes.  The bursts are about 3 seconds apart, at which time a whole bunch of values update at the same time.  I'd like the grid cells to reflect the value updates immediately, and not in batches.  It's as if the grid is trying to improve performance by withholding a lot of individual changes in favour of waiting for a bunch of changes to accumulate before reflecting them in the UI.</p>  <p>My specific binding scenario:</p>  <ul> <li>Winforms</li> <li>DataGridView</li> <li>grid DataSource is a BindingSource</li> <li>BindingSource's source is SortableBindingList of MyClass</li> <li>SortableBindingList inherits BindingList of T</li> <li>MyClass implements INotifyPropertyChanged</li> <li>BackgroundWorker threads make changes to individual properties of list items, with 5 threads running at one time</li> </ul>  <p>Update:</p>  <p>The answer is essentially this: <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms171728.aspx" rel="nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms171728.aspx</a></p>  <p>However, as this is a pet project with me as its end user, I don't feel like going to this length right now, so I've just caught the exceptions, and will put up with the slightly inconsistent grid update behaviour.  At least I see why it's happening.</p>
