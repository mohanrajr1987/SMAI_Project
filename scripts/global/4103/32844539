<p>Somehow I managed to read and parse a CSV file and displayed all data in a DataGridView and data will be stored in database.</p>  <p>When the next time I read data, let's suppose in last data first cell contain date and time.</p>  <p>Next time when a new file is received, then it will have a different date and time.  I want to put that in the database, but I don't want duplicates in the dataset.</p>  <p>I want to make sure that if stored data already contains the same data as in the new file, then it won't be stored. I want to differentiate it with first cell that contain date and time.</p>
