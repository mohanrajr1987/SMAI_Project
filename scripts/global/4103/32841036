<p>When I do</p>  <pre><code>BindingSource mySource= (BindingSource)gridview.mySource; gridview.DataSource=null; gridview.DataSource=mySource; </code></pre>  <p>it results in columns being hidden (<code>visible=false</code>) before now showing up in the datagridview.</p>  <p>Ultimately I just want to delete a row from the gridview, but I figured that removing it from the gridview won't work because of the datasource binding.</p>
