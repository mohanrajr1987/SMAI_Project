<p>I'd like to make a copy of DataGridView's <code>dataSource</code> property, modify the currently applied one and restore the original state later on. Modifying is not the problem but restoring the original <code>dataSource</code> is.</p>  <p>I tried storing the initial one in the constructor method like that</p>  <pre><code>originalSource = new BindingSource(((BindingSource)(dataGridView.DataSource)).DataSource, ((BindingSource)(dataGridView.DataSource)).DataMember); </code></pre>  <p>where <code>originalSource</code> is global, and in the method then creating the <code>BindingSource</code> to modify like that</p>  <pre><code>BindingSource toModify= new BindingSource(originalSource.DataSource,originalSource.DataMember); </code></pre>  <p>and later on restoring it like so</p>  <pre><code>dataGridView.DataSource = new BindingSource(originalSource.DataSource,originalSource.DataMember); </code></pre>  <p>but <code>originalSource</code> still gets updated when <code>toModify</code> is changed. Any help would be appreciated.</p>  <p>BTW: I'm trying to filter a gridview, and I know that there is the <code>filter</code> property, but in order to use that the underlying list would have to implement the <code>IBindingListView</code> Interface which it does not, and it can't be changed that easily.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
