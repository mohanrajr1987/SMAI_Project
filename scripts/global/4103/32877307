<p>I have an Entity with three properties:</p>  <pre><code>YearID PersonID JobID </code></pre>  <p>Those properties are actually foreign keys and so have their own properties:</p>  <pre><code>YearString PersonName JobString </code></pre>  <p>What I'm trying to do is bind to a datagridview using the second level properties, but I can't (or I don't know how).</p>  <p>Currently, I do this:</p>  <pre><code>dgv.Datasource = myEntity.ToList(); </code></pre>  <p>That gives me the all the ID's bound, but I want to use the nice strings (second level properties).  What's the best way to do this?</p>  <p>I need to be able to add/remove entries as well, which complicates things a bit.</p>  <p>I can create an anonymous type, which gives me the secondary properties, but then I can't add new entries (because I need to add the entry to the datasource and the underlying entity).</p>  <p>I could create non-databound columns for each of the nice strings and populate them by hand, but that seems like a crappy solution.</p>  <p>Appreciate some help :)</p>
