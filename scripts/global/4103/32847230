<p>I'm trying to update a MySQL database on the basis of changes in the DataGridView.</p>  <p>I'm currently using this code to fill the DGV:</p>  <pre><code>Private Sub Load_in_DGV_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Btn_Load_in_DGV.Click     Dim ds As DataSet '= New DataSet     Dim mTbl As DataTable     Dim sqlQRY$ = "SELECT `FirstName`, `LastName`, `Age` FROM `persons` WHERE `Age` &gt; 25"     ds = MySqlHelper.ExecuteDataset(CnStr, sqlQRY)     mTbl = ds.Tables(0)     DataGridView1.DataSource = mTbl End Sub </code></pre>  <p>But all post and guides I read seem to use a DataAdapter and not to use MySqlHelper, so I'm asking if it's possible to save changes to database using my current code (and what's the way) and, otherwise, what are minimum changes to do in my code.</p>  <p>I know there is the command "mysqlhelper.UpdateDataSet" which has the following syntax:</p>  <pre><code>Public Shared Sub UpdateDataSet (_ ConnectionString ByVal As String, _ CommandText ByVal As String, _ ByVal ds As DataSet, _ ByVal TableName As String _ ) </code></pre>  <p>but I have not found any example of use. I did not understand what to send as "commandText".</p>
