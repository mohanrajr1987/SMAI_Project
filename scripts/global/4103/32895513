I look them from an id that I put in a textbox if the ID exists the datagrid fills with its information. everything good here the problem is that I want to gather all the 4 prices of each product in one combobox inside the datagridview. i have tried a lot but nothing works. I can only make this:</p>  <pre><code>    '*****With this I fill a combobox*****     Dim CBdepartamento As New ComboBox     Dim Dt1 As DataTable     Dim Da1 As New SqlDataAdapter     Dim Cmd1 As New SqlCommand     'Dim dat As New DataGridViewComboBoxColumn      With Cmd1         .CommandType = CommandType.Text         .CommandText = "select precioventa from productos where idproducto =" &amp; txtcodigo.Text + " UNION select pventa1 from productos where idproducto =" &amp; txtcodigo.Text + " UNION select pventa2 from productos where idproducto =" &amp; txtcodigo.Text + " UNION select pventa3 from productos where idproducto =" &amp; txtcodigo.Text + ""         .Connection = cn     End With     Da1.SelectCommand = Cmd1     Dt1 = New DataTable     Da1.Fill(Dt1)     With CBdepartamento         .DataSource = Dt1         .DisplayMember = "precioventa"         .ValueMember = "precioventa"     End With     '*************************************     '****with this I fill the datagridview with the data obtained of the database***             Try         Dim dt As New DataTable           Using adaptador As New SqlDataAdapter("SELECT idproducto, nombre, precioventa FROM productos WHERE idproducto =" &amp; txtcodigo.Text, cn)             adaptador.Fill(dt)         End Using         dt.Columns.Add("cantidad")         Dim cantt As Integer = 1         For Each dr As DataRow In dt.Rows              dr("cantidad") = cantt             DataGridView1.Rows.Add(dr.ItemArray)         Next         '** this "for" add the pricelist in the cbox in the column "cantidad2" with only one product is fine but if I add another, in each cbox load the four prices of the first product plus the four prices of the second one that is 8 prices in each cbox... 3 products are 12 prices in the list         For i = 0 To Dt1.Rows.Count - 1             cantidad2.Items.Add(Dt1.Rows(i).Item("precioventa"))         Next </code></pre>  <p>Please help me, its almost done I just need it to repeat each product's price in each row's combobox</p>  <p>thank you </p>
