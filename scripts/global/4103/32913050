<p>I'm binding to a <code>List&lt;MyCustomType&gt;</code> and when I put a breakpoint on property getters in <code>MyCustomType</code>, they are seemingly being called repeatedly. What causes the <code>DataGridView</code> to automatically re-read the data and can I control this?</p>  <p>Secondly, I note that when I make changes to the data in the grid, these are not immediately replicated to the DataSource. Putting breakpoints on property setters in <code>MyCustomType</code>, they only seem to be called when I click outside the grid control. How can I make sure changes made in the GUI are immediately applied to the data source?</p>
