<p>I have a filled DatagridView and the following code to check time lapses between rows.</p>  <pre><code>For Each dr As DataGridViewRow In Me.DataGridViewHistoric.Rows     If i = 0 Then         TimeA = CUInt(dr.Cells("UNIX_time").Value)     Else         TimeB = CUInt(dr.Cells("UNIX_time").Value)         If TimeB &gt; TimeA + (Offset * 3600) Then             'Found - Change color             dr.DefaultCellStyle.ForeColor = Color.Blue          End If         TimeA = TimeB     End If  i += 1 Next </code></pre>  <p>That works ok, but now I need to change the color of the previous row that was found.</p>  <p>I can't figure out how meet that goal.</p>
