<p>I'm trying to fill a datagridview after the data set has been filled but i get this error:</p>  <pre><code>Cross-thread operation not valid: Control 'dataGridView1' accessed from a thread other than the thread it was created on. </code></pre>  <p>This is the code I have, it seems to work once and then not again. I'm not 100% sure what cross thread means, since I'm new to C#:</p>  <pre><code>private void backgroundWorker1_DoWork(object sender, DoWorkEventArgs e) {     try     {         superset = new DataSet();         string[] lines = BranchTBox.Lines;          for (int i = 0; i &lt; lines.Length; i++)         {             if (lines[i].Length == 7)             {                 if (qachk.Checked == false)                 {                     connectionString = "Database=" + lines[i] + "; Hostname=" + lines[i] + "." + lines[i] + ".xx; Port = xx; Protocol = xx; Uid=xxx; Pwd= xx;Connection Timeout=1";                 }                 else                 {                     foreach (Control child in panel4.Controls)                     {                         if ((child as RadioButton).Checked)                         {                             qaserver = child.Text;                         }                     }                     connectionString = "Database=" + lines[i] + "; Hostname=" + xx+ ".xx.xx; Port = xx; Protocol = TCPIP; Uid=xx; Pwd= xxx;;Connection Timeout=1";                     connection = new OdbcConnection(connectionString);                     adapter = new OdbcDataAdapter(masterquery, connection);                     connection.Open();                     adapter.Fill(superset);                     superset.Merge(superset);                     connection.Close();                 }                 dataGridView1.DataSource = superset;                 dataGridView1.DataSource = superset.Tables[0];             }         }     } } </code></pre>
