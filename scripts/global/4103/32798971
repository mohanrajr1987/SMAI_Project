<p>I am aware that there are already a few threads on this already created and closed(like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4111308/2-dimensional-integer-array-to-datagridview">2-dimensional Integer array to DataGridView</a>)</p>  <p>My problem is that since I have only been working with console applications, I am not aware of what I need to do in order to apply the code.</p>  <p>Up till now I have drag and dropped a new dataGridView and chose program.cs (where my main is) as a source. Now when I apply the code from the aforementioned link in program.cs, visualstudio is saying that dataGridView1 "does not exist in the current context". When I try to declare it beforehand, I get that the type/namespace can't be found. Any ideas?</p>
