<p>I want to get the image from the datagridview then save it to the database. Can anyone help me with this? It will be so much appreciated</p>  <p>Below is my code in saving the image in the database. I don't know why but it doesn't actually save anything. </p>  <pre><code>Try     connectionSync()     Dim a, b As String     Dim Sql = "INSERT INTO SAMPLE (ID, IMG)values(@a,@b)"      For i As Integer = 0 To Me.DataGridView1.Rows.Count - 1         a = Me.DataGridView1.Rows(i).Cells(0).Value.ToString()         Dim cmd As New MySqlCommand(Sql, ConSync)           Dim memorystream1 As New MemoryStream()         Dim filename As String = DataGridView1.Rows(i).Cells(1).Value         Dim bitmaps As New Bitmap(filename)         bitmaps.Save(memorystream1, Imaging.ImageFormat.Jpeg)         Dim pic() As Byte = memorystream1.GetBuffer()          cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@a", a)         cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@b", bitmaps)         cmd.ExecuteNonQuery()         cmd.Parameters.Clear()     Next     ConSync.Close() Catch ex As Exception        MsgBox(ex.Message) End Try </code></pre>
