<p>I'm looking for a possibility in C# in Windows Forms Application to be able to:</p>  <ol> <li>Select multiple, full rows at a time.</li> <li>Include unselected rows between the selected ones.</li> <li>Then copy them to the clipboard without empty spaces (which are left for the unselected rows).</li> </ol>  <p>The <code>DataGridViewSelectionMode.FullRowSelect</code> doesn't cut it as I also need to be able to select independent cells. I need to enable the same behaviour in row copying as the <code>DataGridViewSelectionMode.FullRowSelect</code> has but for the <code>DataGridViewSelectionMode.RowHeaderSelect</code> mode. Would that be possible to do?</p>  <p>Thanks in advanced.</p>
