<p>I am using RazorEngine and Template functionality to prepare some pages as default.cshtml. These default.cshtml are very simple with some HTML/JS/CSS code and 1-2 lines of MVC if/else blocks. I need to deploy these files outside of the MVC project and directly under a blank asp.net website running 4.5.2 framework.</p>  <p>Can you please let me know what should be web.config entries and what assembly files are to be deployed in the bin folder. FYI: This website will not have anything except these default.cshtml and web.config/bin/etc., if required.</p>  <p>FYI: I am generating these default.cshmtl files using MVC 5.2.3.0, RazorEngine 3.7.2.0.</p>
