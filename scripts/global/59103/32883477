<p>I have multi language in my system using resource file. My current resource file setting is as below:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Build Action: Embedded Resource</p>      <p>Copy to Output Directory: Do not copy</p>      <p>Custom Tool: PublicResXFileCodeGenerator</p>      <p>Custom Tool Names: </p> </blockquote>  <p>In my view, this is how I set my value from resource file:</p>  <pre><code>@Project1.App_Global.Resource-en.Title </code></pre>  <p>This work perfectly fine in my local and after deploying the application. </p>  <p>But right now I need to allow user to edit the resources file for all languages without the need of recompiling and deployment, so I need the resources file to be generated as an external file instead of compiling as a DLL in the bin folder. </p>  <p>I'm following some idea to allow the resource file to be generated as an external file by changing each resource file to following setting:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Build Action: Content</p>      <p>Copy to Output Directory: Do not copy</p>      <p>Custom Tool: PublicResXFileCodeGenerator</p>      <p>Custom Tool Names: </p> </blockquote>  <p>But after the changes above, my application is throwing error at the part where I call <code>@Project1.App_Global.Resource-en.XXXX</code>. The exception is as below:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Could not find any resources appropriate for the specified culture or the neutral culture.  Make sure "Project1.App_Global.Resource-en.resources" was correctly embedded or linked into assembly "Project1" at compile time, or that all the satellite assemblies required are loadable and fully signed.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I tried deploying my application, I can see the resource files inside App_Global folder, but couldn't test because of the error.</p>  <p>Any advice on what am I missing? What is the correct way to retrieve the resource value in View?</p>
