<p>I am using the script ('<a href="http://l2.io./ip.js?var=myip" rel="nofollow">http://l2.io./ip.js?var=myip</a>') to get user ip details in my application. This will give the proper details when we load the page (sample.cshtml) initially, but the same page calling via the ajax means throws the Cross-Origin-Request-Blocked issue. Also, i checked the response header details in firebug and found that there is no Access-Control-Allow-Origin value not set in Response Headers as shown in the below screenshot. </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/RCoYC.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/RCoYC.png" alt="Cross-Origin-Request-Blocked"></a></p>  <p>Is this the exact reason for the issue? or there is some other reason for this?If so how to overcome this ?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
