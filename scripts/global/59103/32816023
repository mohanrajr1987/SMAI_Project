<p>I want to build a .NET site with MVC and have some external links on it. These URLs I don't want to show directly, but through customized ones.  </p>  <p>For example: instead of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/69996673/lower-case-urls-in-asp-net-mvc">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/69996673/lower-case-urls-in-asp-net-mvc</a>, just only <a href="http://example.com/link/1234" rel="nofollow">http://example.com/link/1234</a>. </p>  <p>I know in PHP man can do it with .htaccess and a php file but I'm not sure it's possible in ASP.NET. Someone has suggested me to do it with .cshtml but I don't know how.</p>  <p>Can someone please help me to clear this question?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>  <hr>  <p><em>Updated:</em></p>  <p>Thanks for all your tipps. After reading the 2 pages on codeproject.com you suggested, I just think that these are useful only for internal URLs, for external they seem to be complicated. </p>  <p>I would think that for each external one I will have one URL: <a href="http://example.com/link/1234" rel="nofollow">http://example.com/link/1234</a> and then when clicked it will link with one View 1234.cshtml. This cshtml file should then redirect to the actual link (I don't know as it's possible with Razor). </p>  <p>So I believe there must be a simpler way to get the job done. So anyone else  has other ideas, please share! Thanks!</p>
