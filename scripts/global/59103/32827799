<p>I have a SQL Server database and ASP.NET web site on which I use Razor. I have the tables <code>people</code>, <code>teams</code>, and <code>link_people_teams</code> (consisting of 2 foreign keys: <code>people.people_ID</code> and <code>teams.team_ID</code>). </p>  <p>On the web page I want to display a list of all team names, and under each one display the names of people in the team. I have a Razor code block at the top of the page.</p>  <pre><code>@{     var db = Database.Open("dbName");     var team = "SELECT team_ID,team_name FROM teams";     var people = "SELECT people_ID,First_Name,Last_Name FROM people"; } </code></pre>  <p>I know I need to declare more variables, but I don't know where to go from here.</p>  <p>On the page where I want to show the list of teams and people in the team, I only know how to generate a list of teams:</p>  <pre><code>@foreach (var row in db.Query(team))     {       &lt;p&gt;@row.team_name&lt;/p&gt;       &lt;!-- Person(s) on the team should appear next --&gt;       &lt;p&gt;Person Name&lt;/p&gt; } </code></pre>  <p>How can this be done?</p>
