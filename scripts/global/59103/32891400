<p>I have 2 dropdowns for month (which store values 1 - 12) and for year:</p>  <pre><code>@Html.DropDownList("Month",ViewData["MonthList"] as SelectList) @Html.DropDownList("Year", ViewData["YearList"] as SelectList) </code></pre>  <p>And I have an HTML.ActionLink that forwards to controller action which requires Date as input:</p>  <pre><code>@Html.ActionLink("Show for This Month", "EntriesInMonth", "Entries"     , new { date = DateTime.Now }, null) </code></pre>  <p>The question is how can I make a date object from selected values and pass it to the ActionLink when I clicking on it?</p>
