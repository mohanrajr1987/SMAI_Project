<p>I use Visual Studio Enterprise 2015. I started a new "ASP.NET Web Application" project and from "ASP.NET 4.6 Templates" I chose "MVC" (MVC4).</p>  <p>In my Index.cshtml View I added the following "divs" in order to create a  navigation menu for my web application:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div class="NavigationItem" onclick="@{Html.ActionLink("HOME", "Index", "home");}"&gt;    HOME &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="NavigationItem" onclick="@{Html.ActionLink("ABOUT", "About", "Home");}"&gt;    ABOUT &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="NavigationItem" onclick="@{Html.ActionLink("CONTACT", "Contact", "Home");}"&gt;    CONTACT &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>The CSS class "NavigationItem" which I use has the following code:</p>  <pre><code>.NavigationItem{     font-size: 13.5pt;     color: #3A3A3A;     font-family: Arial;     margin: 33px 10px 4px 10px; }  .NavigationItem:hover {     color: #CC0000;     border-bottom: 4px #CDCDCD solid; }   [![Mouse_Hover][1]][1] </code></pre>  <p>The code is executed, but the "onClick" event of the div does not fire when I click on a div. Consequently, the "ActionLink" is never executed. The question is: how can I invoke the execution of the "ActionLink" if the div is clicked?</p>  <p>In case you know how could such think be implemented, or if you have an idea, please let me know. It is going to be a great help to me.</p>  <p>Thank you in advanced.</p>
