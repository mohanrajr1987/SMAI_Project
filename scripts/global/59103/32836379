<p>I have read some theory based on Partial View, leaving me out with a few doubts. As I have read in some of the posts about Partial View in SO, I understand Partial View is a View that contains no Layout. Or a simplified version of a View that can be reused. For instance for a sidebar I could use Partial Views. </p>  <p>But I would like to know if I would like to render another View inside a View can Partial View be used? For instance I have a table with a list of items, I would like to display another table when one of the row in the parent table is clicked. Can the child table be represented using Partial View? Or do I need to look for something else to achieve the same?</p>
