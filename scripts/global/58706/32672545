<p>I am starting with a new application and I have updated my version of Sencha CMD, now I have latest version, I am working with Mac OSX and the mapping of the web-server (sencha app watch) is not correct, always I am booting in the next path <code>Users/&lt;myname&gt;</code>but normally, I was working with Sencha CMD 4 and when I generated an app and I wrote in the terminal the command, web server was boot in the correct folder of my application.</p>  <p>My steps:</p>  <p>1ยบ I downloaded the latest version of Sencha CMD and I followed the standard steps.</p>  <p>2ยบ I create a folder for a new app and I write <code>Sencha generate app ...</code> command.</p>  <p>3ยบ Last step, to see the result I write the <code>sencha app watch</code>command </p>  <p>I see in the terminal is <strong>mapping to incorrect folder</strong> instead of this folder where I created a new app, and if I want to see the app I must navigate to the correct folder. </p>  <p>What is doing wrong now?</p>
