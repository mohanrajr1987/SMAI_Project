<p>Sencha Touch will complain about files it can't find a lot. Usually you just include the file. But sometimes the problem is a faulty include. So then you need to find where the file is being requested. Since it won't tell you where the require is located, that can be a problem.</p>  <p>Currently I have another such file. Tried something, it didn't work, now I want the files out of my project. But somehow Sencha Touch keeps looking for it. I've tried:</p>  <ul> <li>Find specifically in the locations it was included</li> <li>Find in bootstrap.js</li> <li>Find All for the file name</li> <li>Rebuild of the project with Sencha CMD (complains about the same problem)</li> <li>Empty cache and hard reload in Chrome</li> <li>Other browsers, they crash even worse</li> </ul>  <p>Anyone have a trick to find remaining requires in Sencha Touch?</p>
