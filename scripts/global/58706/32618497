<p>I`m using the community Calendar component <a href="http://www.swarmonline.com/products/extensions/ext-ux-touchcalendar/" rel="nofollow">Ext.ux.TouchCalendarView</a></p>  <p>I`m trying to LOAD my calendar on DAY mode, setting or loading a array of hours that I get from server-side. </p>  <p>For example, I need to load in my calendar only hour 1 and 2 pm from 17th September. The final result is a DAY MODE calendar with 2 elements (hour 1 and 2 pm, 17th september).</p>  <p>I couldn't figure out how to make it reading docs.</p>
