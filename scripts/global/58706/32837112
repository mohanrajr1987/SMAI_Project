<p>Hi I have a store with name and values, I want to change/update the values of the store based on the user selection in settings screen. suppose I have data like this</p>  <pre><code>data: [                     {firstName: 'Tom',value:1},                     {firstName: 'Ed',value:2},                     {firstName: 'Jam',value:3},                     {firstName: 'Aar',value:4},                     {firstName: 'Dav',value:5},                     {firstName: 'Mic',value:6}                 ]  </code></pre>  <p>When user changes settings (I am storing this change of settings in global variable), all values should change to multiples of 2 as below and update my view with these new values. </p>  <pre><code>data: [                     {firstName: 'Tom',value:2},                     {firstName: 'Ed',value:4},                     {firstName: 'Jam',value:6},                     {firstName: 'Aar',value:8},                     {firstName: 'Dav',value:10},                     {firstName: 'Mic',value:12}                 ] </code></pre>  <p>I need some idea how to implement this and best way to do it.</p>
