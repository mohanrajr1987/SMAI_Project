<p>Our application has been working in off-line mode for a long period of time. During latest version it stopped. We identified that it is connected with the size of the application due the size of all new controllers and the way Sencha copy the files to the local store for the upgrade process. Copying all files to the local store is exhausting the space so at the end some files are not copied there but the device  has a copy locally based on the manifest. We are not using the mechanism of delta upgrade, we always update the application entirely. </p>  <p>Is there anyway we can bypass this process of copying files to the local store or do not verify against the local store and trust entirely in the manifest mechanism using the standards of HTML 5?</p>
