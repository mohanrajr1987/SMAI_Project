<p>I'm using a filter on a store to find entries with a specific number but when I filter only a single digit, the filter finds other numbers as well, if the specific digit occurs within that number.</p>  <pre><code>store.filter('shiftNum', 1); </code></pre>  <p>In this case the filter may find entries such as 10, 11, 12 as well, and so on.</p>  <p>As there are only 21 possible numbers in my store, a problem arises only when filtering numbers 1 or 2. A quick fix may be to input only double digits eg .01, 02. But theoretically the filter should search for only the number and nothing else. I tried changing the fields in the model to specify a number field, as apposed to "auto" or "string" but it doesn't help. </p>  <pre><code>Ext.define('Sidur.model.Opt', {         extend: 'Ext.data.Model',         config: {             fields: [                 {name: 'shiftNum', type: 'number'},                 {name: 'name', type: 'string'}             ],             proxy: {                 type: 'sqlitestorage',                 dbConfig: {                     tablename: 'sidur'                 }             }         }     } ); </code></pre>  <p>(By the way the data is stored locally on WebSQL)</p>
