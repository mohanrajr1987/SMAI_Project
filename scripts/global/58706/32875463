<p>I am trying to add a custom spinner logic to a spinner field I have. I have been able to customize the spinner in the "view" by using onSpinUp:.</p>  <p>I am looking to refer to the spin up step in the controller but I am not having success. I am unable to reach the debugger I have in the "spinner" function. </p>  <p>This is what I have so far, I am not sure what I am missing. Could someone shed light on this? Thanks in advance.</p>  <pre><code>`control:{      currentTime:{ //currenTime is the itemId      spinup: 'spinner' // spinner is the function name    }, }` ` spinner: function (){      debugger; } ` </code></pre>
