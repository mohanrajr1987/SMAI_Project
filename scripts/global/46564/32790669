<p>I have over 10,000 downloads of my android app. I have google admob setup. For the iPhone version, it is working fine. We are generating revenue. For the android version, no revenue is being generated at all. People aren't seeing the ads.</p>  <p>Also, we have complaints that many people can't login to the android app. We use an API to our separate server to login people, we don't use the meteor accounts system.</p>  <p>Our HTTP calls to the remote server don't seem to be working. Also, admob isn't displaying the ads. So it seems that there are general connectivity issues with the android version of our app.</p>  <p>I have in mobile-config.js this line:</p>  <p>App.accessRule('*');</p>  <p>Shouldn't that line allow for any connection to any server? I can't figure out why the HTTP calls and the admob ads aren't working.</p>
