<p>It is to my understanding that the way to do what I am describing above is to add the following lines of code into the gradle </p>  <pre><code>project(":ios") {     apply plugin: "java"     apply plugin: "robovm"      dependencies {         compile project(":core")         //...         compile "org.robovm:robopods-google-mobile-ads-ios:1.6.0"     } } </code></pre>  <p>However after doing this, Im lost as to what the next step is.. Im expecting something similar to what I have done to make it work with the android devices. However I cant seem to find the right information for this, any help would be very much appreciated on what the next step for me should be</p>
