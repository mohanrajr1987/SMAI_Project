<p>I recently received an email for an app update that I had submitted stating that they are rejecting my app due a 'ad policy' violation!</p>  <p>Also read this <a href="http://googleadsdeveloper.blogspot.com/2014/04/how-to-create-google-mobile-ads-splash.html" rel="nofollow">blog</a>: Update (March 24, 2015): Per recent policy updates, interstitial ads on app-load are not recommended. See the AdMob help center for the latest interstitial policy guidance.</p>  <p>I had used this ad only in one place in the entire app and yet it seems to have violated their policy. The worst part is the ambiguity on Google's part.</p>  <p>Is the best solution now to remove the ad? Are interstitial ads now banned by Google on Android apps?</p>
