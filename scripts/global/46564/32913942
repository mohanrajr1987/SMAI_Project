<p>I have a problem with the interstitial fill rates. I know this questions is almost off topic, but as it has to have something to do with my code, I hope you guys won't close it and if someone has an idea, its highly appreciated.</p>  <p>For example in one app, i put this code in onCreate():</p>  <pre><code>    private static InterstitialAd interstitialAd;      ...      interstitialAd = new InterstitialAd(this);     interstitialAd.setAdUnitId(ADMOBID_INTERSTITIAL);     interstitialAd.setAdListener(new AdListener() {         @Override         public void onAdLoaded() {      ...      AdRequest.Builder requestBuilder = new AdRequest.Builder();     interstitialLoading = true;     interstitialAd.loadAd(requestBuilder.build()); </code></pre>  <p>then the user has some input to do, which should take him at least 30-45 seconds. Then before the next activity is started, I do this:</p>  <pre><code> if (interstitialAd.isLoaded() &amp;&amp; showAds) {         interstitialAd.show();  }  </code></pre>  <p>I mean there is no magic involved in this. I do not use any keywords for the requests. Normal ad banners are filled with 99%. My Interstitial only 30%-40%</p>  <p>Where can I improve this?</p>
