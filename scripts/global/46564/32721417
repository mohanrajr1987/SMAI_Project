<p>This is not a programming but the best practice question. I have been looking for answer on internet but no success so far. </p>  <p>Question is very simple.  Do you guys keep only one banner per app or one banner per view.  I have app which is 4 tabs and having 2 navigation drill down. Its pretty basic app and things are already out of in my admob dashboard.  So I am here. seeking advice from people who have multiple apps on appstore.  How you manage ? If I am keeping only one admob signature per app. would it affect my impression.  I am thinking to have one banner and one interstitial per app.  Don't know if that right thing to do.  Please suggestion. </p>  <p>PS: I know its not programming question, but its not useless question. I am sure there are people like me out there. </p>
