<p>I am using admob and to do this I have installed the Google required SDKs via Android Studio. I am using LibGDX so on my android manifest I put in:</p>  <pre><code> &lt;meta-data android:name="com.google.android.gms.version"         android:value="@integer/google_play_services_version" /&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I may have done more steps but anyways, my point is that the ads are fully working, I can see the sample ads from google. However, on my code, whenever I reference the Google Ads service it shows errors - red code. So there it does not finish the code for me when I am typing .AdsRequest etc... but it still works. What could be the problem. Maybe I did not import the library properly? Please help. Thanks</p>
