<p>I use <code>Admob</code> Mediation with Facebook Audience Network in our unity game to display interstitials.</p>  <p>On Android : all works fine On iOS : - If I don't add this, no facebook ads are shown. I got lots of request (with 82% of fillrate) but 0 impressions. - If I add <code>[FBAdSettings addTestDevice:@"xxxx"];</code> in <code>GADUInterstitial</code> : all works fine but I see, of course, only test ads et only on my device.</p>  <p>Have you any suggestion?</p>
