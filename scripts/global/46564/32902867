<p>What is the threshold to get paid after closing an AdMob account?</p>  <p>On <a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/2772208" rel="nofollow">AdMob help</a> it says: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>The table below lists the different thresholds for each reporting currency.</p> </blockquote>  <p>but there is no table below.</p>  <p>Then I found <a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/1709871#c" rel="nofollow">this overview</a>, but it is for AdSense. Can I assume the threshold is the same for AdMob?</p>  <p><strong>Edit: I didn't see the table using Firefox or Chrome, but Microsoft Edge displayed it.</strong></p>
