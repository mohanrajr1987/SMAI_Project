<p>I have a project with Cordova on Android Studio and all was working fine. I have added the Cordova Plugin Admob (pro), from <a href="https://github.com/floatinghotpot/cordova-admob-pro" rel="nofollow">Github office site</a>. When I add the plugin and try to debug on my device, I have an error (build project works fine). If I remove the plugin and create again the project with the command "<em>cordova create platform android</em>" all work fine.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Error:Execution failed for task ':dexDebug'.   com.android.ide.common.process.ProcessException: org.gradle.process.internal.ExecException: Process 'command '/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_79.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java'' finished with non-zero exit value 2</p> </blockquote>  <p>In the console, I can see that:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>AGPBI: {"kind":"simple","text":"UNEXPECTED TOP-LEVEL EXCEPTION:","sources":[{}]}   AGPBI: {"kind":"simple","text":"com.android.dex.DexException: Multiple dex files define Landroid/support/annotation/AnimRes;","sources":[{}]}</p> </blockquote>  <p>My project "android" has these dependencies:</p>  <pre><code>dependencies { compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: '*.jar') // SUB-PROJECT DEPENDENCIES START debugCompile project(path: "CordovaLib", configuration: "debug") releaseCompile project(path: "CordovaLib", configuration: "release") compile "com.google.android.gms:play-services-ads:+" // SUB-PROJECT DEPENDENCIES END </code></pre>  <p>}</p>  <p>I have added the Google Play Services in the SDK Manager, but I think that I have a conflict with the Google Play Services library or something... </p>  <p>Can someone tell me how can I fix it? I have read some similar questions, but I have no idea where to start...</p>  <p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Information from the official plugin:</p>  <ol start="3"> <li>Build error with message "Multiple dex files define Lcom/google/..."</li> </ol>  <p>Caused by duplicated google-play-services.jar.</p>  <p>This plugin properly referenced to the google-play-services.jar in your android sdk with tag framework , which is recommended by Google team.</p>  <p>While some other plugins contains the jar, or depends on a plugin named com.google.playservices which is already deprecated.</p>  <p>Please list all plugins and check which plugin use it improperly, then report a bug to that plugin.</p>
