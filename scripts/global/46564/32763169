<p>I need to display a few banners with <code>PublisherAdView</code> inside a list built with the <code>RecyclerView</code> widget and I'm not sure how to map <code>PublisherAdView</code> lifecycle with the <code>ViewHolder</code> one. </p>  <p><code>PublisherAdView</code> documentation mentions three lifecycle methods:</p>  <ul> <li><code>resume()</code>: Resume a PublisherAdView after a previous call to pause(). This method should be called in the parent Activity's onResume() method.</li> <li><code>pause()</code>: Pause any extra processing associated with this PublisherAdView. This method should be called in the parent Activity's onPause() method.</li> <li><code>destroy()</code>: Destroy the PublisherAdView. This method should be called in the parent Activity's onDestroy() method. No other methods should be called on the PublisherAdView after destroy() is called.</li> </ul>  <p>The problem is that the <code>ViewHolder</code> could be created and destroyed at any time and its lifecycle is not tied to the Activity one. Plus, my <code>RecyclerView</code> is inside a <code>Fragment</code> and the latter has a its own lifecycle.</p>  <p>My idea is:</p>  <ul> <li>Call <code>resume()</code> within <code>RecyclerView.Adapter.onViewAttachedToWindow()</code></li> <li>Call <code>pause()</code> within <code>RecyclerView.Adapter.onViewDetachedFromWindow()</code></li> </ul>  <p>But I'm not sure about how to properly call <code>.destroy()</code>.</p>  <p>Any experience with that? Any best practice?</p>
