<p>When i check the Monetize app, select clicks and then let the data present in the world map I see several countries that have a light orange color. When I hover over them it tells me that there where no clicks in this country. Is this intentional? Does it mean that those are removed misclicks or is it just random?</p>  <p>I'm thinking its because in those countries other data informations are available (like impressions) but I can't find a place to confirm it.</p>
