<p>The current version of GoogleMobileAds.framework is v7.4.1 which was created with bitcode enabled.  The current version of GoogleCast.framework is v2.7.1 which was created without bitcode enabled.</p>  <p>In Xcode 7, if I set Enable Bitcode to NO, then the ads framework will generate error.  But if I set Enable Bitcode to YES, then the cast framework will generate the error. </p>  <p>So, how to go about use these two frameworks in a project?</p>
