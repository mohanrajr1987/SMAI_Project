<p>So my AdMob account has been disabled and I published many apps via the corresponding e-mail address. I don't see why I couldn't monetize those apps from my other google developer account (it is legit to have multiple accounts), since I just have to create a new campaign in my active AdMob account and use the ad ids generated there in the app. I would ask it from AdMob support, but there is no contact form at all regarding these kind of questions.. Obviously if anyone knows how to contact them (I just found the appeal form) would be even better. </p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
