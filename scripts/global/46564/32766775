<p>The default message for <a href="http://www.cookiechoices.org/" rel="nofollow">EU-user consent</a>  is</p>  <blockquote>   <p>"We use device identifiers to personalise content and ads, to provide   social media features and to analyse our traffic. We also share such   identifiers and other information from your device with our social   media, advertising and analytics partners."</p> </blockquote>  <p>My app uses Admob, Google Analytics and Google Play Games (leaderboards). In the code I neither collect advertisingId nor read device identifiers. </p>  <p>Which parts of the user consent message are relevant for my setup?</p>  <p>Does Admob by default:</p>  <ul> <li>personalise ads </li> <li>collect advertisingId</li> <li>share identifiers with Google or other partners?</li> </ul>
