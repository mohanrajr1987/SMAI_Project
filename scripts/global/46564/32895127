<p>Device BACK button in my as3 is prevented from default action and does other stuff instead (exits the app if main menu is currently displayed and returns to main menu if main menu is not displayed).</p>  <pre><code>NativeApplication.nativeApplication.addEventListener(KeyboardEvent.KEY_UP, keyUp); function keyUp(e:KeyboardEvent) { if (e.keyCode == Keyboard.BACK) { e.preventDefault(); // do stuff } } </code></pre>  <p>It works fine except in one case - when I click the AdMob banner (implemented through native extension) and then return from browser to app. Then the back button doesn't return to menu, instead it closes the app.</p>  <p>Weird thing is, back button stops working properly only when I return to app after clicking AdMob banner. If I click any other buttons that open the browser and then return to app, the back button works fine. It even works fine after I return to app after clicking the AdMob interstitial ad! So only AdMob banner breaks the back button.</p>  <p>I have tried to add back button listener again on Event.ACTIVATE (when user returns to app), but it didn't help.</p>  <p>What is happening and how can i prevent this? I wrote the admob native extension myself, so i can try to fix this issue both in as3 or android java. Thanks!</p>
