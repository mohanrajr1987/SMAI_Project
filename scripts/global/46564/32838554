<p>I am writing an Android game and will be implementing Admob ads. My question is this - can I write code to switch an Admob ad off after it has been loaded, or do I have to have multiple activities in the app and attach the ad to one of these? (it would be much simpler to just have 1 activity in this particular app)</p>  <p>If I cannot shut it off, is there any necessary shut-down operation I should be performing when traversing from the activity with the ad to another activity, in order to ensure that the 2nd activity does not show an ad?</p>  <p>Note;</p>  <p><a href="https://developers.google.com/admob/android/quick-start" rel="nofollow">https://developers.google.com/admob/android/quick-start</a> <a href="https://developers.google.com/admob/android/ad-events" rel="nofollow">https://developers.google.com/admob/android/ad-events</a></p>
