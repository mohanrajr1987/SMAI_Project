<p>I am currently adding admob banner to my IOS app. I have already used aduinitID for my bannerView. But I haven't distributed the app yet .When I was testing on real device and simulator, without any doubt, Admob didn't count my request for these banner. </p>  <p>But How can I make sure that when I release the app they would count it for me .  How will admob detect when my app gets online . Or is there any step that I have to do in advance, or when my app is confirmed that it was approved by apple to notify admob that my app is on store?</p>  <p>By the way, how much money in dollars do I get when displaying banner and Interstitial when using admob? And how much when user touch on the banner .</p>  <p>In addition, can I create several bannerViews but just only lay them on the same position on my Viewcontroller? The point is to increase request in the case displaying banner to make profit.</p>
