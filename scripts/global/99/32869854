<p>I need to rename a video after i capture it with media-capture plugin. After some reading i understood that it should be done via moveTo method. Here is some code: </p>  <pre><code>   window.resolveLocalFileSystemURL('cdvfile://localhost/root/storage/ext_sd/DCIM/100MEDIA/VIDEO0045.mp4', function(file){     console.log(file);       file.getParent(function(dir) {       console.log(dir);       file.moveTo(dir, "bla.mp4", function(e){         console.log(e);         debugger;       }, function(e){         console.log(e)         debugger;       });     }, function(e){       console.log(e)       debugger;     })   }, function(e){     console.log(e);     debugger;   }); </code></pre>  <p>So, file is found, dir is found too (both resolveLocalFileSystemURL calls are resolved with FileEnrty and DirectoryEntry). But file.moveTo invocation fails with error code 1 ('file not found' as far as i remember).</p>  <p>In my manifest file there is a permission WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</p>  <p>What can be wrong?</p>  <p>Added: I've tried to use the function on a file located in internal memory - it worked. Also it was ok moving file FROM sd card. But still breaks on when the destination folder located on a card.</p>
