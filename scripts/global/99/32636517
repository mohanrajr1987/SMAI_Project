<p>Im trying to understand the reasoning behind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Format" rel="nofollow">AF</a>'s new standard?</p>  <ul> <li>I understand the reasoning for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-block_architecture" rel="nofollow">fixed block architecture</a> and why IBM made it 1979</li> <li>I understand processors, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_(computer_memory)#Page_size_trade-off" rel="nofollow">paging sizes</a></li> <li>I understand  <a href="http://www.seagate.com/tech-insights/advanced-format-4k-sector-hard-drives-master-ti/" rel="nofollow">sector layout</a></li> </ul>  <hr>  <p>The only reasoning Ive seen is:</p>  <p>The Long Data Sector Committee (now AF comittee) selected the 4K block length for the first generation AF standard for several reasons, including:</p>  <ol> <li>its correspondence to the paging size used by processors and some operating systems</li> <li>as well as its correlation to the size of standard transactions in relational database systems.</li> </ol>  <hr>  <p>But... even in back in the day (1970's) IBM declared some fixed sizes of :</p>  <ul> <li>100 -Bytes</li> <li>200 -Bytes</li> <li>270 -Bytes</li> <li>366 -Bytes</li> <li>512 -Bytes</li> <li>1024 -Bytes</li> <li>2048 -Bytes</li> <li>4096 -Bytes (AF Standard)</li> </ul>  <p>Regardless to these two reason the AF Committee gave and which I listed above, which seem very system dependent.... my only guess of reasoning is that the AF Committee defines the average file size on a computer as of the year 2010 (when the standard was ratified/finalized) the size of (4KB).</p>  <p>But who the hell are they to say the average sector size (block-size)? </p>  <p>Wouldn't it be way more efficient to partition your disc based on file format and declare sector size based on the file format being stored, so that your page sizes correlate to the average size of that specific format? </p>  <p>Example: You create a partition on a disc for only storing .txt files and you declare the sector size based on a calculation of the average .txt file size based from all the .txt file stored inside that partition.</p>  <hr>  <p>Summary:</p>  <ol> <li>Is the AF Comittee's standard, what they define the average file size on computers?</li> <li>Is this standard size defining a non-specific file type?</li> <li>Wouldn't it be better to partition a disk based on a specific file format, so that you will have less paging operations?</li> </ol>
