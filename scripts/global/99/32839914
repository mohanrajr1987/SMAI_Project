<p>I have a local GIT repo with commits but so far unsynced. I created it as per <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/20004092/586754">http://stackoverflow.com/a/20004092/586754</a> which basically results in the local part of the repo with no remote/origin.</p>  <p>I don't have a (company) GIT server but a Onedrive for Business account that seems perfect to at least backup the repo in case the dog eats the machine. (Plan for later is to migrate to comany VCS, which is SVN, once things have stabilized.)</p>  <p>I know that GIT can sync to a file system, but.. how to do it?</p>  <ol> <li><p>Since I already entered some wrong data as a remote repo in Visual Studio (it asked when I went for the "Sync" option, complained, and now all options are greyed out under "Sync"), how do I change this? Only via the command line like</p>  <pre><code>git remote set-url origin "C:\Users\Test\OneDrive for Business\Andreas\code\project1" </code></pre></li> <li><p>What is the correct  GIT URL for a network share and also for a local share? (In my case, I am most interested in the local Windows share, since I expect Onedrive to be responsible for the backup.)</p></li> </ol>  <p>I have an empty folder as a remote right now (I created full path including "project1") and also am getting errors via command line:</p>  <pre><code>git push --set-upstream origin master fatal: 'C:\Users\Test\OneDrive for Business\Andreas\code\project1' does not appear to be a git repository fatal: Could not read from remote repository. </code></pre>  <p>Is anything else needed for initial push? Sor far, I have only used bitbucket/github, where I explicitly created a repo beforehand via web interface.</p>
