<p>I recently came across quite a useful load balancing/reverse proxy tool called Nginx. I know that it equally sends out the incoming requests to my four servers, and that is great, but it gives me a different issue.</p>  <p>Suppose I was running a blog of some sort, and a new user created his account and was redirected by Nginx to go to one of servers, let's say Server #1 of 4. Now he's working. He sets up his page, posts a couple posts about cats, and now he's ready to pack it in for the night, and he logs out.</p>  <p>The next morning he logs back in, but this time Nginx redirects him to Server #2 of 4. He goes to his blog page, but nothing is there because all of the .html files were stored on Server #1 of 4.</p>  <p>Basically, my question is how is one of the servers on the network supposed to access, or even know, where a file is on another server?</p>  <p>Right now, I have a couple of ideas. I'll list them below, and you guys tell me if they are even possible.</p>  <ol> <li><p>Have one central server for storing all files. This server doesn't take any requests. It just provides all of the .html, .css, and .js files for the server that needs them. (I still don't know how to access these files though)</p></li> <li><p>Synchronize all files on all servers. When one file updates, all of the duplicate files update. (This seems like kind of a waste of server space, though)</p></li> </ol>  <p>Once again, I'm sorry if this is a really dumb question. I'm not too experienced in these things. I'm using Ubuntu Linux Server edition by the way. Thanks guys.</p>
