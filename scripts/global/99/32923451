<p>I'm trying to use <a href="https://github.com/gorakhargosh/watchdog" rel="nofollow">watchdog</a> to run a sync script whenever anything changes in a dir (except for one specific file). I simply copied the code from the readme (pasted below), which does what it says; log which file has changed.</p>  <pre><code>import sys import time import logging from watchdog.observers import Observer from watchdog.events import LoggingEventHandler  if __name__ == "__main__":     logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO,                         format='%(asctime)s - %(message)s',                         datefmt='%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')     path = sys.argv[1] if len(sys.argv) &gt; 1 else '.'     event_handler = LoggingEventHandler()     observer = Observer()     observer.schedule(event_handler, path, recursive=True)     observer.start()     try:         while True:             time.sleep(1)     except KeyboardInterrupt:         observer.stop()     observer.join() </code></pre>  <p>I now want to run a function (which syncs the whole folder to a remote machine) whenever anything changes. So I just replaced <code>event_handler</code> with my own function. But that gives me the following error:</p>  <pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):   File "/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/threading.py", line 810, in __bootstrap_inner     self.run()   File "/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/watchdog/observers/api.py", line 199, in run     self.dispatch_events(self.event_queue, self.timeout)   File "/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/watchdog/observers/api.py", line 368, in dispatch_events     handler.dispatch(event) AttributeError: 'function' object has no attribute 'dispatch' </code></pre>  <p>Does anybody know what I'm doing wrong here? All tips are welcome!</p>  <p>ps. I also want to exclude one file in the folder from being watched. Any ideas how I should do that?</p>
