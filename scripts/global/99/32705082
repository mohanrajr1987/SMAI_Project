<p>I'm trying to write something to parse the used cluster bitmap data on an NTFS partition. There's lots of reference that mostly says the same thing, but concepts that one bit of reference is not clear on, none of them are clear on. I've read that there's the MFT zone which gets preallocated to cover a bunch of the known mft records (including $BitMap) and it takes up 12.5% of the disk. Since the size of the used cluster bitmap is known at format time, it makes sense to assume that it will always live in one contiguous unchanging spot on the disk. But I can't find anything that confirms this. Is it possible to resize a partition so that the $BitMap has to grow and thus might become a fragmented file?</p>  <p>I read this: <a href="https://flatcap.org/linux-ntfs/ntfs/files/bitmap.html" rel="nofollow">https://flatcap.org/linux-ntfs/ntfs/files/bitmap.html</a> which kind of hints at the idea that the mft zone completely covers the $BitMap, but it doesn't actually SAY it.</p>  <p>Anybody have any ideas, or other reference that might give details about this kind of thing?</p>  <p>I also find that the term "bitmap" is ambiguous, because it refers both to the used cluster bitmap and the bitmap of data in an mft attribute that is "Used to implement the B-tree structure for large folders and other large indexes". Am I reading all that correctly?</p>
