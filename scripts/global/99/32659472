<p>This seems like it should be a common problem, but finding an answer isn't trivial.  Active Directory users I work have difficulty understanding that moving a folder between locations with different access privileges is not the same as copying it.  I sometimes wish for a 'allow/deny move' privilege along with read, write, execute, etc., but haven't had time or motivation to ponder the problems that would introduce. What are the best practices for keeping folders and inherited rights where I want them?</p>
