<p>There is file named "<strong>status.html</strong>" which is used as a loadbalancer between WFE's on SharePoint servers. My query, is I want to come up with a script or a mechanism that will trigger a mail, as soon as this file is edited by someone. Is it possible?? In my research I have found this script:</p>  <pre><code>$ACL = new-object System.Security.AccessControl.DirectorySecurity $AccessRule = new-object System.Security.AccessControl.FileSystemAuditRule("domain\seitconsult","Modify","success") $ACL.SetAuditRule($AccessRule) $ACL | Set-Acl "C:\windows\system32\cmd.exe" </code></pre>  <p>But I'm not sure if that will work. Also, how can trigger an email using this script. Kindly help.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
