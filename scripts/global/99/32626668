<p>I need to compare two folder trees, but as there are 300,000 files in each, WinMerge cannot do the job in less than ~ 100 hours. The trees are different only by 10-15%, that is, mostly the files and folder structure is the same with the minor difference (some new folders in A tree, some new files in B tree).</p>  <p>What is needed is, for example, comparing by size and same name only, not byte-to-byte as WinMerge does.</p>  <p>What is a way or tool to do the job?</p>  <p>[edit] In WinMerge there's a folder compare method 'Quick' and 'Size', but </p>  <p>I ran the analysis with the Size compare method, and still the analysis seems to be taking long,long time.</p>  <p>So WinMerge does not seem to be fast enough to solve the task.</p>
