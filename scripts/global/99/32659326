<p>I'm currently using a piece of software (let's call it ThirdPartyApp) that reads files from a certain directory on my PC. I want to make my own software (call it MyApp) that generates files for ThirdPartyApp. When ThirdPartyApp tries to load <code>/path/to/somefile</code>, instead of <code>somefile</code> getting read from the hard drive, I want MyApp to get called and generate bytes in real time. This is similar to how reading from, say, <code>/dev/urandom</code> doesn't actually load a file called <code>urandom</code>, but instead loads the output of a random generator.</p>  <p>So, my question is, is this even possible to do in userspace? If so, what is this called? I'm not asking for a recommendation of a specific library or anything like that; I just need to know what to google to find info about doing something like this. Oh, and I only care about making this work on Linux, if that's a limiting factor. Thanks!</p>
