<p>I'm working with IOPS, then understand that any disk/drive always has sequential access and random access. I have a question that those accesses depend on the application we used. So, if I'm watching movie what kind of access is being used or I'm typing some piece of text what kind of access is being used there. Thank you so much!</p>
