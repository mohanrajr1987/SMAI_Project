<p>As a school project I am creating an encryption program in c#. I am using the AES 256 encryption algorithm. I want to store all the encrypted data for multiple files in one file. This file would include: The encrypted paths (for reading into the GUI) and the encrypted bytes (for when the user requests the path in the GUI for the file to decrypt) What is the most efficient way to store all this information in one file? (The file will at most times be too big to read it all into memory)</p>
