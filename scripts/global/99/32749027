<p>Same question as this except for HFS+</p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32705082/is-it-possible-for-the-ntfs-bitmap-to-be-fragmented">Is it possible for the NTFS $BitMap to be fragmented?</a></p>  <p>There are 8 possible extents where the bitmap is mapped, as with all file entries, but there's nothing saying it can't use the extent overflow file if the amount of fragments exceeds 8. So is there any way of knowing without question that that will never happen.</p>
