<p>I am using a rockchip 3188 based system on board which has 8 gb NAND flash. I want to test the reliability of the NAND flash.  At least , I want to identify boards with bad NAND flashes shipping from factory.</p>  <p>I am using Ubuntu 14.04. The NAND flash is partitioned into two parts : 1. mtd0: contains bootloader, kernel and initrd 2. mtd1: contains RFS</p>  <p>I tried running mtd_stresstest by "modprobe mtd_stresstest dev=1" and it never says a word. If I run it for too long, my system is getting corrupted. The corruption is expected as it is playing with the same device / is mounted on. But the command is not returning even if I use count=1. Please let me know what is going wrong.</p>  <p>I tried the following too:</p>  <ol> <li>Flashed a USB stick with ubuntu rfs meant for arm and plugged it to SOB.</li> <li>bind mounted /proc to /media//proc</li> <li>bind mounted /sys to /media/ <li>cd /media/</li> <li>chroot .</li> <li>init 1</li> <li>modprobe mtd_stresstest dev=1 count=1 ----> never says a word</li> </ol>  <p>Could you please also suggest if there is any other way test the NAND flash device reliability.</p>
