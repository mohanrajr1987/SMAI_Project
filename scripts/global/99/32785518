<p>Here is what I am trying to acheive. I have a FUSE filesystem that is running on my server. I want to be able to mount this filesystem on my client. I implemented my filesystem using python(fusepy). I have read a little about xmlrpclib which can be used for communication between the client and server. But I am quite confused if I should move around the whole filesystem from the server to the client when it is mounted or, I should just retrieve it on the go while traversing the directories. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.</p>
