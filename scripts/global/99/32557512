<p>I have a requirement where I need to copy some exe files from one machine which is in network of company A to another machine which is in network of company B. The issue I have is both the companies resources are not shared as they are very strict when it comes to Network saftey and also they are not willing to open any ports to outside access. </p>  <p>Is there a way to copy/transfer the files to company B from company A</p>  <p>PS. I am using citrix to access machines of company B from company A. Is there any library available from Citrix to accomplish this task. </p>  <p>Thanks a lot for your help on this. </p>
