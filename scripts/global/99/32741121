<p>I would like to know if there is a way in Qt to obtain the filenames of files in a folder ordered according to the current Windows Explorer Settings for this folder. In Windows Explorer the user can sort files by many different criteria (e.g. name, capture date etc.) and I would like to be able to maintain maintain that order in my application.</p>  <p>UPDATE:</p>  <p>Perfect would be a cross-platform solution which also works in Finder on Macintosh and in Nautilus on Ubuntu.</p>
