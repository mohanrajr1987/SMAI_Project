<p>i know how to read/write a from/to a file in c using FILE pointer.But i want to go one step ahead and learn how to directly read/write to the disk partition.Also what is the difference between writing to a file and to a disk.Also can i manipulate the content already present on disk such as videos,images etc.</p>  <p>I am using C language on Linux 14.04 with gcc as my compiler.</p>  <p>TIA. </p>
