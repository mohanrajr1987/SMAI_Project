<p>I used to work under Linux and one of my hard drive is formated as btrfs.</p>  <p>Recently I installed Windows 10, and couldn't find that btrfs disk any more.</p>  <p>It seems there is no software available like ext2fs(access ext fs in windows), I only find <a href="https://github.com/jgottula/WinBtrfs" rel="nofollow">WinBtrfs</a> in github and it doesn't work and is not actively developed.</p>  <p>Somebody figure that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/32d6wr/is_there_a_windows_tool_that_allows_access_to/" rel="nofollow">running Virtualbox on the PC and having the drives shared via Samba</a>. But I don't get it, since the btrfs volume is invisible in Windows, how to share it with the VM?</p>  <p>And I don't want to use samba...</p>  <p>Which way can I try now, or just wait and hope someone or MS solve it?</p>
