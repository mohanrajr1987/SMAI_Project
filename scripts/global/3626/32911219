<p>I have a table user_settings which references the user table to save some settings. But I decided to use the settings in a column in the user table.. All good, but now all my settings are in a separate table, and I'm trying to find a query to "import" the user_settings fields into the "setting" column in the user table.</p>  <p>Something like this:</p>  <pre><code>UPDATE USER  SET setting=settings.value JOIN USER_SETTINGS    ON USER_SETTINGS.USER_ID = USER.ID  </code></pre>  <p>Having a hard time figuring this out, could someone give me a hand?</p>
