<p>My first query...</p>  <pre><code>SELECT     t1.a, t1.b, t1.c,     t2.a, t2.b, t2.c  FROM t1  LEFT JOIN t2 ON t1.a = t2.a  WHERE t1.b = '000000'  AND LENGTH(t1.a) &gt; '5'  AND t1.c &lt;&gt; 'Y'; </code></pre>  <p>My second query...</p>  <pre><code>SELECT     t1.a,     t3.b as testMe  FROM t1  LEFT JOIN t3 ON t1.a = '0' + LEFT(t3.a, 5)  WHERE t1.a = '017941'; </code></pre>  <p>Both of these queries work fine by themselves, but I need them combined into one result set. Worth noting is that the <code>where</code> clause in the second query is there for testing purposes, but when I remove it the whole thing crashes. Not sure if that means I need something to filter by, or it's timing out? The database I'm using is Pervasive.</p>  <p>My failed query...</p>  <pre><code>SELECT     t1.a, t1.b, t1.c,     t2.a, t2.b, t2.c,     t3.b as testMe  FROM t1  LEFT JOIN t2 ON t1.a = t2.a  LEFT JOIN t3 ON t1.a = '0' + LEFT(t3.a, 5)  WHERE t1.b = '000000'  AND LENGTH(t1.a) &gt; '5'  AND t1.c &lt;&gt; 'Y'; </code></pre>  <p>I've shorted my code to better show what I have going on, but the actual code can be found here: <a href="http://codeshare.io/A2aB9" rel="nofollow">http://codeshare.io/A2aB9</a></p>
