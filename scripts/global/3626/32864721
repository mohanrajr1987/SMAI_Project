<p>I am struggling to get this answer for some reason.</p>  <p>I have two tables, table1 and table2 which look like this:</p>  <p>Table1:</p>  <pre><code>ID   Location  Warehouse 1    London    Narnia 2    Cyprus    Metro 3    Norway    Neck 4    Paris     Triumph </code></pre>  <p>Table2:</p>  <pre><code>ID   Area      Code 1    London    Narnia 2    Cyprus    Metro 3    Norway    Triumph 4    Paris     Neck </code></pre>  <p>I need to first select everything from table1 where <code>table1.Location</code> is in <code>table2.Area</code> <strong>AND</strong> <code>table1.Warehouse</code> is in <code>table2.Code</code> <strong>GIVEN THAT</strong> <code>table1.Location</code> is in <code>table2.Area</code>. I.e. I want:</p>  <pre><code>ID   Location  Warehouse 1    London    Narnia 2    Cyprus    Metro </code></pre>  <p>I have got to:</p>  <pre><code>select   1.location , 1.warehouse from table1 1 where 1.location in (select area from table2) and 1.warehouse in (select code from table2) </code></pre>  <p>But this won't work because I need the second where clause to be executed based on the first where clause holding true.</p>  <p>I have also tried similar queries with joins to no avail.</p>  <p>Is there a simple way to do this?</p>
