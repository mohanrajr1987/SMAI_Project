<p>I have 3 sql tables </p>  <p>1) a table with headers of a coupon - id of this equals the id of the second table </p>  <p>2) a tables with details of the coupon - user_id on this tables equals user id of the third table</p>  <p>3) a table with details of user  </p>  <p>So far I have this query </p>  <pre><code>"SELECT kpn_processed_deals.kpn_id, kpn_processed_deals.purchased_date, kpn_processed_deals.claim,  kpn_processed_deals.uid,kpn_deal_headers.kpn_type, kpn_deal_headers.title,kpn_deal_headers.created_by  FROM kpn_processed_deals INNER JOIN kpn_deal_headers ON  kpn_processed_deals.kpn_id = kpn_deal_headers.kpn_id AND  kpn_deal_headers.created_by = '$var'"; </code></pre>  <p>This works just fine but I want to get the value of the users email on the third table using a join but I have been unsuccessful so far. Sorry if my formatting is messy. I'm horrible at these things.</p>
