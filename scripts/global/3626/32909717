<p>I created a table 'One' on mySQL where I import data from file111 (csv). It imports <strong>dates</strong> and <strong>names</strong>.</p>  <p>I created a table 'Two' where I import data from file222 (csv). It imports <strong>old names</strong> and <strong>new names</strong>. </p>  <p>Keep in mind that:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>One.names = Two.old_names</p> </blockquote>  <p>I want a final table will show the data from table 'One' but it will replace the <strong>old names</strong> with the <strong>new names</strong>.</p>  <p>Here is my code regarding the creation of the tables:</p>  <pre><code>    -- Table creation : 'One'     create table One(     report_start date,     name varchar(500)     );      -- Import of Data in the table 'One'     LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'C:/file111.csv'     INTO TABLE One     FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','     ENCLOSED BY '"'     LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'     IGNORE 1 ROWS     ;      -- Table creation with one column for the "old names" and one for the "new names" for "name" field.     create table Two(     old_name varchar(500),     new_name varchar(500)     );      -- Import the OLD names and NEW names in the table 'Two'     LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'C:/file222.csv'     INTO TABLE Two     FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','     ENCLOSED BY '"'     LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'     IGNORE 1 ROWS     ; </code></pre>  <p>Now I have two options. One is <strong>INSERT INTO</strong> a third table after creating it. Exactly as shown below:</p>  <pre><code>create table Three( report_start date, name varchar(500) );  -- Our new table has all the data from 'One' except for the "name". The data will be imported in this column fields from the table "Two" INSERT INTO Three (report_start, name) SELECT report_start, Two.new_name  FROM One INNER JOIN Two ON Two.old_name = One.name ; </code></pre>  <p>The other option is to UPDATE the first table and using JOIN :</p>  <pre><code>update One  join Two t on ( One.name = t.old_name ) set One.name=t.new_name; </code></pre>  <p>They both work the same but which one is more efficient? I have started dealing with large amounts of data so I need get the most efficient and safe. </p>
