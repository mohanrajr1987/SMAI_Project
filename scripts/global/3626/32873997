<p>I have a query that finds rows with duplicate street names:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT a.id, a.street1, a.postal_code, a.fk_countryID FROM address a INNER JOIN (   SELECT b.street1, b.postal_code, b.fk_countryID   FROM address b   GROUP BY b.street1, b.postal_code   HAVING count(b.id) &gt; 1 ) duplicate ON a.street1 = duplicate.street1  AND a.postal_code = duplicate.postal_code AND a.fk_countryID = duplicate.fk_countryID ORDER BY a.street1, a.postal_code  </code></pre>  <p>The result is (ignore NumStores column): </p>  <pre><code>+-------+-----------------+------------+------+-----+-----------+ | id    | street          | postalCode | city | CC  | NumStores | +-------+-----------------+------------+------+-----+-----------+ | 11101 | Bogstadveien 36 | 0366       | Oslo | NO  |     ?     | | 11102 | Bogstadveien 36 | 0366       | Oslo | NO  |     ?     | | 11103 | Bogstadveien 36 | 0366       | Oslo | NO  |     ?     | +---------------------------------------------------+-----------+ </code></pre>  <p>The goal is to delete duplicate rows. In order to do this job, I need to see how many stores is actually using each address. The ones with 0 count I can delete right away. The ones with 1 or more I have to "move" to the address I want to use before deletion. This is all done manually through GUI (JS/PHP).</p>  <p>So the question is; How can I add the number of stores for each row?</p>
