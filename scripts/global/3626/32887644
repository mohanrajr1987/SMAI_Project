<p>I'm learning SQL and happen to hang on a point that confuses me:</p>  <p>I got 1 table with 1 column (boys.boy) while boy is a varchar.</p>  <pre><code>SELECT boys.boy, boys.boy  FROM boys  LEFT JOIN boys    ON length(boy) &gt; length(boy) </code></pre>  <p>Why am I unable to do this? Would this break some invariant, or why did the inventors explicitly bring in "self-joins"?</p>  <p>In other words, this works ("self join"):</p>  <pre><code>SELECT b1.boy, b2.boy  FROM boys AS b1  INNER JOIN boys AS b2    ON length(b1.boy) &gt; length(b2.boy) </code></pre>  <p>The magic lies in the aliases (AS ...).</p>
