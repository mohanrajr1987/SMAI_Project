<p>I have a table Table A that has a one-to-many relation with Table B. This Table B has a many-to-many relation with Table C and another many-to-many relation with Table D using a join table. Now I have an id for Table A that I want to use to fetch Table B with all its joins. Is this a subquery of a simple select would be sufficient?</p>  <pre><code>SELECT    tableB.id,    tableC.id,    tableD.id  from    TableB tableB LEFT JOIN TableC tableC ON tableB.id = tableC.id LEFT JOIN TableD tableD ON tableB.id = tableD.id  where   tableB.tableAId = :id </code></pre>  <p>Is this correct?</p>
