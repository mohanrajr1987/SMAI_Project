<p>I'm developing an android app and <strong>it works in android 4.x version perfectly but in android 2.2 it stops working and does nothing without any error</strong>. From the debug I found that this problem is because of a join sql statement and when it comes to while statement it stops with no error.</p>  <pre><code>selectedHospitalId = 3;         cursor = G.dbHelper.myDataBase.rawQuery("Select Distinct HospitalDosageForm.DrugID, DrugsName.DrugName,"                     + " HospitalDosageForm.IRC from HospitalDosageForm Join DrugsName On HospitalDosageForm.DrugID = "                     + "DrugsName.DrugID Where DrugsName.DrugNameType = 'A' "                     + "and HospitalDosageForm.DosageFormID = -1 and HospitalDosageForm.HospitalID = "                     + selectedHospitalId + " order by DrugsName.DrugName", null);                 G.drugs.clear();                 while (cursor.moveToNext()) {                     drug = new Drug() {};                     drug.DrugID = cursor.getInt(cursor.getColumnIndex("DrugID"));                     drug.DrugName = cursor.getString(cursor.getColumnIndex("DrugName"));                     drug.BrandID = cursor.getInt(cursor.getColumnIndex("IRC"));                     drug.HospitalID = selectedHospitalId;                     G.drugs.add(drug);                 } </code></pre>  <p>It should return about 600 rows from my sqlite db.  I tested table view,thread,async and ... but I didn't find any solution.  I do appreciate for any help</p>
