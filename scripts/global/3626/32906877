<p>I have two tables, lets call it table A and table B. They looks like:</p>  <pre><code>A.col1        A.colX            B.colY 1             123               123 2             234, 123          234      3             2, 52352          2                                 52352 </code></pre>  <p>What I have to do is to JOIN them, most probably using WHERE, because non-equi join is not supported in my environment. I have the problem with table A, where numbers are as string. I tried solution with:</p>  <pre><code>    select ... from A, B     where A.colX LIKE concat('%', B.colY, '%') </code></pre>  <p>but it doesn't work correctly as for example value '2' from B.colY appears in every string from table A.colX.</p>  <p>At the end example what i want to achive:</p>  <pre><code>          output 1         123 -------&gt; 123 2         234, 123 --&gt; 234 1         234, 123 --&gt; 123 3         2, 52352 --&gt; 2 3         2, 52352 --&gt; 52352 </code></pre>  <p>Do you have any ideas for that ?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance ! :)</p>
