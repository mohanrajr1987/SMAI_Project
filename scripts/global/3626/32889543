<p>Need some help with this query, I just want to know if what I am doing is fine or do I need JOIN to get it better. Sorry if this a silly question but I am little worried as I query the same table thrice. Thanks in advance</p>  <pre><code>Select *  from TableA  where (A_id in (1, 2, 3, 4)         and flag = 'Y') or        (A_id in              (select A_id from TableB               where A_id in                          (Select A_id from TableA                           where (A_id in (1, 2, 3, 4)                             and flag = 'N')               group by A_id               having sum(qty) &gt; 0)     ) </code></pre>  <p>Relation between TableA and TableB is one-to-many</p>  <p>Condition or Logic:</p>  <ul> <li>if the flag is true, the data can be selected without further checks </li> <li>if the flag is false, we have to refer TableB to see if sum of the qty column is greater than 0</li> </ul>
