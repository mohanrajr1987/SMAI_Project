<p>In my MySQL db i have these 3 tables:</p>  <pre><code>ACCOUNT (primary key is name)  name  directory  birthdate  sex  FILES (primary key is id)  id (autoincrement)  name (account foreign key)  filename  uploaded_date  CHECKED (primary key is the couple name - filename)  name (account foreign key)  filename (files foreign key) </code></pre>  <p>I want to make a query that shows a resulting table like this:</p>  <pre><code>RESULT  name - directory - birthdate - sex - filename uploaded_date - checkedCount </code></pre>  <p>Where in checkedCount column i want to have the existing row's count number in CHECKED table for every unique filename.</p>  <p>I tried with this but i had no success:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM account NATURAL JOIN files) AS table_alias LEFT JOIN (SELECT *, count(*) AS checkedCount FROM checked) AS checked_alias ON table_alias.filename = checked_alias.filename </code></pre>  <p>Currently in ACCOUNT table there are only 2 row, in FILES table 6 rows and in CHECKED tables there are 6 rows with the same name from ACCOUNT and all others 6 unique filenames from FILES.</p>  <p>I can't understand why in my resulting table in checkedCount columns i have all values setted to null, except one that is setted to 6. My goal should be to have all six rows with checkedCount = 1 since every FILE in FILES table is used one times in CHECK table.</p>
