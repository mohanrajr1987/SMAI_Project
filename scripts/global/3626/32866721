<p>I have three mySQL-tables like this:</p>  <pre><code>client                   network                   activities \_id                     \_id                      \_id \_name                   \_name                    \_client_id \_[...]                  \[...]                    \_[...] \_network_id </code></pre>  <p>Now I want to have the following result:</p>  <pre><code>client.*, network.name, number_of_activities_for_each_client </code></pre>  <p>Actually I have this select-statement:</p>  <pre><code>select client.*, network.name  from client  left join network  on client.network_id = network.id </code></pre>  <p>How do I extend the statement? I would also like to see all clients.</p>
