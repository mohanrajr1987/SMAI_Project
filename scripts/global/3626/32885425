<p>I've got 2 table which have file paths in then.</p>  <pre><code>the first table has 2 column: P_ID Path-Snip  the second table also has 2 column: Path_def Value </code></pre>  <p>The Path_Snip is a reduced path which is related to an area of the program.</p>  <p>What I'd like to do is Join the two table to have a table with 4 column:</p>  <pre><code>P_ID Path_Snip Path_def Value </code></pre>  <p>I'd like to match the paths together so that the similar Path_Snips are joined with the similar Path_def:</p>  <p>Example of what I'd like the table to look like:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>P_ID   = 1 </p>      <p>Path_Snip  = branches/Projects/Enhancements2015Q1/Encryption</p>      <p>Path_def   = branches/Projects/Enhancements2015Q1/Encryption/Encryption.csproj</p>      <p>Value      =  12</p> </blockquote>  <p>As the 2 paths match I'd like to keep them together </p>
