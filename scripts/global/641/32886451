<p>I was wondering if there's a way to generate a new SSL certificate for XAMPP. I get a lot of SHA-1 warnings in the firebug console and I think it's because of using SSL which has sha1 as algorithm.</p>  <p>However, I can't seem to find how to generate a new certificate with a better hash. If I'm saying things that makes no sense, please don't hate on me as I've never worked with SSL certificates before.</p>  <p>Also, I cannot suppress the warnings as I use firebug and the warnings just makes my POST files harder to find.</p>
