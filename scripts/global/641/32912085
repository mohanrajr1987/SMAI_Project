<p>I'm getting ready to roll out a PHP application hosted on Google App Engine. It needs to have SSL support and I'm trying to decide between SNI and VIP. There may be a chance some Windows XP users access the site, but probably not. My thought was to start out using VIP, check the Analytics to see if there are any Windows XP users, then switch to SNI if possible. </p>  <p>Can a switch like this be made? If so, do you have any thoughts on the process of doing it?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
