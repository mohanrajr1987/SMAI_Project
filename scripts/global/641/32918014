<p>My app engine app is doing well, but I want to toggle the "only allow secure connections" option in the Cloud SQL configuration. When i do so, I can still connect remotely and in local development. However, my deployed app stops working with a 1045 error "access denied" </p>  <p>I cannot figure out where to store/upload the ssl certificates on the deployed app or how to call them from settings.py</p>  <p>Can someone please help?</p>  <p>Here is the relevant section of settings.py (redacted)</p>  <pre><code>if os.getenv('SERVER_SOFTWARE', '').startswith('Google App Engine'):     # Running on production App Engine, so use a Google Cloud SQL database.        DATABASES = {     'default': {     'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',     'HOST': '/cloudsql/&lt;myappengineapp&gt;:&lt;mycloudsqlinstance&gt;',     'NAME': 'test',     'USER': 'root',     'PASSWORD': '&lt;mypassword&gt;',     'OPTIONS':           &lt;ssl goes in here?&gt;      } } </code></pre>  <p>else:     # Running in development, but want to access the Google Cloud SQL instance</p>
