<p>Our intranet website has to communicate with a client .NET app. We're using a HttpListener (on <a href="http://localhost:[port]" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:[port]</a>) on the client app and an iframe that refers to this url in the page. Its working like a charm when the page is HTTP.</p>  <p>Problem: When the site is HTTPS a 'Mixed content' Javascript error is displayed in newer browsers and the request doesnt arrive at the client.</p>  <p>I believe this error would also occur when using an Ajax request instead of an iframe.</p>  <p>I also tried to bind a self-signed certificate to the listener and listening on <a href="https://localhost:[port]" rel="nofollow">https://localhost:[port]</a> (which works for IE), but since the Firefox has its own certificate store its really tough to install it there automatically (IE uses Windows certificate store which is easy to install there).</p>  <p>So, does anyone know any possibility to make a request to <a href="http://localhost:[port]" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:[port]</a> when the site itself is HTTPS that works for both FF and IE?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
