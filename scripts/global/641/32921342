<p>I followed <a href="http://www.napcsweb.com/blog/2013/07/21/rails_ssl_simple_wa/" rel="nofollow">this tutorial</a> "Rails with SSL in Development The Simple Way" and successfully set up SSL for a Rails app. Now I created a second Rails app and it is trying to use SSL even though I didn't configure it to. </p>  <p>I am wondering why this is happening and what I can do to stop it. </p>  <p>I did manage to get the second app working by following the steps in the tutorial, but I didn't intend to make it use SSL. Before doing that, it was throwing errors about <code>invalid HTTP format, parsing fails</code> and my browser said <code>SSL connection error - ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR</code>. I even made sure that <code>config.force_ssl</code> was set to <code>false</code> in in <code>application.rb</code></p>  <p>The command to start the thin SSL server is <code>thin start --ssl  --ssl-key-file server.key --ssl-cert-file server.crt </code> which is slightly different than the deprecated command in the tutorial. </p>  <p>I'm on Linux Mint by the way. </p>
