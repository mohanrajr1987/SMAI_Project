<p>I develop the rest api and need auth on each request.  I want to make server do basic auth via ssl. I've found topic  <a href="http://www.avajava.com/tutorials/lessons/how-do-i-set-up-ssl-on-tomcat.html?page=1" rel="nofollow">how configure ssl on tomcat</a> but all topics about organization of basic auth for Java EE. </p>  <p>I use Spring and know about Spring Security but not a lot.  How can I set up basic auth via spring-security?</p>  <p>Or how convert this <a href="http://www.avajava.com/tutorials/tomcat/how-do-i-use-basic-authentication-with-tomcat/web.xml" rel="nofollow">web.xml</a> to Java based type for class that implements WebApplicationInitializer.</p>  <p>Also I'll be happy if hear about best practice for secure REST API and technologies for it. </p>
