<p>I bought a ssl certificate generated with SHA-2 algorithm. It was successfully installed in apache2 server. I also test it with online tool like <a href="https://www.sslshopper.com" rel="nofollow">https://www.sslshopper.com</a> and the result is completely ok, however in firefox console I got something like this</p>  <blockquote>   <p>This site makes use of a SHA-1 Certificate; it's recommended you use certificates with signature algorithms that use hash functions stronger than SHA-1.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I also double checked with Chrome and other browser. It seems ok. </p>  <p>is there any gotchas related to my certificate ?</p>  <p>please help and thanks in advance.</p>
