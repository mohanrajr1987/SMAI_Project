<p>I'm building a small ReactNative iOS application. In it, I use the fetch API to make a simple get request to a server I control that has a valid - but self-signed - SSL cert. Understandably, this causes an error.</p>  <p>Between iOS/JSC, I'm unsure how (or what!) I can configure for my app to ignore this error - all the answers I've found so far are related to Objective-C solutions, I'm looking for something I can use with a JSC environment.</p>
