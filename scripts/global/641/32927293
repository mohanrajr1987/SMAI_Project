<p>I have a linux server hosting multiple websites. I'm server admin and there will at no point be anyone besides me having authorized access. At the moment port 22, 80 and 443 is accessible. Only saved keys are allowed access to a limited user by SSH.</p>  <p>At the moment all logfiles are parsed by fail2ban.</p>  <p>Would it be a security risc to host a web based terminal behind a HTTPS encrypted connection protected with an .htpasswd file based to just having plain SSH access? The connection will be proxyed through nginx, so no additional ports will be open to the outside.</p>  <p>Until recently i would have said yes, but discussion have got me wodering.</p>
