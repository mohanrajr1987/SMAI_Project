<p>I have set up my MongoDB to only accept connections over SSL. Mongo has a handle to a certificate that I generated with the following commands</p>  <pre><code>openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -new -x509 -days 365 -nodes -out server-cert.crt -keyout server-private.key cat server-cert.crt server-private.key &gt; /etc/ssl/mongoSSL.pem </code></pre>  <p>I added the following to my /etc/mongod.cnf...</p>  <pre><code>sslMode=requireSSL sslPEMKeyFile=/etc/ssl/mongo/mongoSSL.pem </code></pre>  <p>Whenever Tomcat attempts to talk to Mongo, it fails due to not presenting the SSL certificate. I set up my /opt/tomcat/conf/server.xml to have the following</p>  <pre><code>&lt;Connector port="27017" protocol="org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol"     SSLEnabled="true" scheme="https" secure="true"     clientAuth="false" sslProtocol="TLS" keystoreFile="/etc/ssl/mongo/mongoSSL.pem"/&gt; </code></pre>  <p>This, however does not work. Does anyone have a link to a tutorial that can further my knowledge on how this is done? I found a tutorial to configure SSL with <a href="http://crunchify.com/step-by-step-guide-to-enable-https-or-ssl-correct-way-on-apache-tomcat-server-port-8443/" rel="nofollow">Apache</a> and I found the <a href="https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/config/http.html#SSL_Support" rel="nofollow">Apache Docs on SSL Support</a> however neither seem to be for my use case. Thanks.</p>
