<p>I'm using:</p>  <ul> <li>CentOS 6.7</li> <li>Zend.1.2.15 using oci8, using instantclient 11.2 x64</li> <li>PHP 5.4.45</li> </ul>  <p>Trying to connect to an Oracle:</p>  <ul> <li>Oracle Database 10g Release 10.2.0.4.0</li> </ul>  <p>Already checked credentials, already tried to connet to other Oracle server but the error still the same:</p>  <pre><code>12546 ORA-12546: TNS:permission denied * </code></pre>  <p>Already gave 0777 permission to <code>/usr/local/oracle/11.2/client64/</code> following some answer around but none of them solved.</p>  <p>Server does not have the IP in any sort of blacklist.</p>  <p>The same code runs in any other Windows PC with OracleInstantClient and no further configuration was needed on the server about giving an IP permissions to access or any permission at all.</p>  <p>Is there something more that I can check to solve this? </p>
