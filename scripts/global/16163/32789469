<p>I have a database on 10g, which is running fine without any issues. I want to restore it to some another server. My current log sequence is 169. One day while taking RMAN full backup i deleted some archived log files i.e. <strong>"DELETE NOPROMPT ARCHIVELOG uNTIL TIME 'SYSDATE-1/24';</strong>". Later on this backup piece got deleted somehow. Now i have a database running fine but without old archive logs. Now my problem is</p>  <p>How to restore and recover database if old archive logs are lost. Because while recovery it will ask for archive log with older sequences like 14,15 or so.</p>  <p>Thanks,</p>
