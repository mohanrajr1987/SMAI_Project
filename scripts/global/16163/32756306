<p>In my Oracle <code>10G</code> database, I have a table with contents as shown below:</p>  <pre><code>category  |   items ------------------- 1         |   A,B 2         |   C,D,E ..        |   ... </code></pre>  <p>The <code>items</code> column contains a comma-separated list of values. I need a query to split the values in this column, and return them as a set of rows while also displaying the corresponding value of the <code>category</code> column in the containing row. That is, the result set should look something like the below:</p>  <pre><code>category | item ------------------ 1        |  A 1        |  B 2        |  C 2        |  D 2        |  E ..       | .... </code></pre>  <p>How this can be achieved?</p>  <p>Please note, I have already developed a query, using recursive SQL, which works fine in a <code>11G</code> database; However, I need something that can work in <code>10G</code> as well.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
