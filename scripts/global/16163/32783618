<p>If I have</p>  <pre><code>function(col) new_col </code></pre>  <p>in a view, and I need a list (SELECT column FROM tbl), big and always the same, for this fuction, should I pass a collection </p>  <pre><code>function(col, CAST(MULTISET(SELECT column_name1 FROM table_name) AS T_TEXT)) new_col </code></pre>  <p>Or just make a select inside this function? Or are there any better solutions?</p>  <p><strong>Edit:</strong> The result of the function is just a VARCHAR2, in fact, it's multiple_replace function and the input collection for this function is all the strings_to_replace. Those strings_to_replace are always the same for each view row and are selected from a table.</p>
