<p>Currently I am working on a problem where I have to log data in a Oracle10g database. I want to store data from up to 40 devices (but not necessarily always 40) as one data point, these share a bit of information and the rest is device specific. </p>  <p>So I could either create arrays for every device-specific column and if the device is in use the according array field is getting populated.</p>  <pre><code>ID TIMESTAMP BOARD DEVICE_ID[40] ERROR_CNT[40] TEMP[40] MORE_DATA[40]... </code></pre>  <p>But I think I would be wasting a lot of database space by doing it like that, because the arrays would be hardly populated</p>  <p>The other method I can think of would be to just use the same ID for a multi-line entry and then I put as many rows into the table as I have used devices.</p>  <pre><code>ID TIMESTAMP BOARD DEVICE_ID ERROR_CNT TEMP MORE_DATA 1  437892    1     1         100       25   xxx 1  437892    1     2         50        28   yyy </code></pre>  <p>Now the shared information is multiple times in the database and the data is shattered among multiple lines.</p>  <p>Another issue is that there might be columns used by a part of the devices and some do not carry that information, so there might be even more unused fields. So maybe it would be best to create multiple tables and split the devices into groups according to the information they have and log their data in the corresponding tables.</p>  <p>I appreciate any help, maybe I am even paranoid about wasted db space and should not worry about that and simply follow the 'easiest' approach, which I think would be the one with arrays.</p>
