<p>I have some table and trying load data into it by selecting row from another table like below.</p>  <pre><code>insert into emp2(eid,ename,sal,my_seq_num) select eid,ename,sal from emp1; </code></pre>  <p>When I executed the   above query I am getting the error 'not enough values' because I selected only three rows but insert contains 4 columns .So my question is how can Insert a sequence number automatically (like we write SYSDATE to write into date column)  .</p>
