<p>problem with Oracle AQ in 10G when register a new record, in DELAY field add 5 hours this add refer to my Oracle DB 10G config time zone that is -5 'America/Bogota'. add new register at 6:00 and register in queue table at 11:00. I was do it a trigger to change DELAY field but not execute this register, AQ not change the STATE field to 0, cero value meaning the ready state or available register to dequeue.</p>  <p>Thanks for advance.</p>
