<p>Jdev version 11.1.1.7.1</p>  <p>I am using Oracle Database 10g XE &amp; I am able to connect to the DB and retrieve all tables in HR schema. But when I am trying to create "Business components from Table" I am getting the above mentioned error. I have uninstalled Jdeveloper and once again reinstalled it. Still I am getting the same error.</p>  <p>Here is the description of the error :-</p>  <pre><code>The following SQL statement failed :  SELECT /*OracleDictionaryQueries.ALL_ORACLE_OBJECT_QUERY(3)*/    O.OBJECT_NAME, O.OBJECT_TYPE, O.OBJECT_ID FROM   ALL_OBJECTS O WHERE  O.OWNER = ?
