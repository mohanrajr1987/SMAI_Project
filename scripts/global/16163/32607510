<p>I have a C# application running in Visual Studio 2010. When running it from Visual Studio (debug and release) it connects to an Oracle DB with no problems. When I attempt to run it outside of VS, I get an exception when it tries to connect.</p>  <p>The message is </p>  <p>"ORA-01019: unable to allocate memory in the user side."</p>  <p>I thought this may be something missing from the deployment project but I still get it when running the exe from the bin\release folder.</p>  <p>I've read that this error code can be caused by not having local admin privileges, but I am an admin. I have also seen that it can be caused by having multiple oracle clients but I only have Oracle 10g.</p>  <p>I'm running on Windows 7 x64 and have asked a co-worker with a similar machine (less VS2010) to try it and it connects fine on his machine (and also on an XP x86 machine). </p>  <p>The only other potentially relevant factor I can think of is that both my co-worker and myself have to work under the jackboot of Avecto Privilege Guard.</p>  <p>Please let me know if you'd like further information.</p>  <p>edit: If possible, I'm looking for a solution that doesn't require majorly tweaking my PC, but can be self-contained in the application so that other users don't experience the same problem.</p>
