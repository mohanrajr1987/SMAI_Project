<p>I moved my Database from local development (Oracle 11) to a development server (10g). Then I tried to update my EF6 model (DB first), since 2 rows got added (regular <code>number(1,0)</code> rows). Opening the Model Browser, I do see the updates in the table, but the Entity is not updated accordingly. Removing the whole table and re-importing it, or creating a new model and re-importing the whole DB yields the same result. I am using VS2012, EF6, Oracle ODP.Net in its latest version (12.1.0.2.1). Any ideas? Do I need additional privileges? Is there any way to have a "verbose" output from the model generation script? Any ideas and help are appreciated! Thank you</p>  <p>Edit: Let me add that creating the property manually and then mapping it works.</p>
