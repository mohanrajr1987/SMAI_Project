<p>I have a PL/SQL application which has a log out button with following code being executed when log out button is clicked:</p>  <pre><code>-- Open the HTTP header owa_util.mime_header('text/html', FALSE, NULL);  -- Send a cookie to logout owa_cookie.send('WDB_GATEWAY_LOGOUT', 'YES', path=&gt;'/');  -- Close the HTTP header owa_util.http_header_close;  -- Generate the page htp.p('You have been logged off from the WEBSITE'); htp.p('&lt;a href="http://myApp/pls" target="_blank"&gt;click here to log in&lt;/a&gt;'); htp.p('&lt;BR&gt;bye'); </code></pre>  <p>It works perfect when using internet explorer, however when I use mozzila when I log back in I am still logged in as previous user. Has anyone else been in this situation? How can I make this work for mozilla as well? </p>  <p>I got this code from oracle documentation page:  <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B13789_01/server.101/b12303/secure.htm" rel="nofollow">https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B13789_01/server.101/b12303/secure.htm</a></p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
