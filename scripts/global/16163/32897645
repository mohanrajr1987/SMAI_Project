<p>I have cobbled together the code below that loops through some featureclasses and outputs the total by fc and also a sum of the number of feature classes. The final piece to my puzzle that I cant get right is how to now sum the totals of each feature class so I dont need to add them up in my head. I have read numerous similar posts but they all seem to be focused on returning the sum of a feature class, not sum of multiple feature classes. (Im on Win 7, Oracle 10g, Python 2.7.5, ArcGIS 10.2.1) My working code so far .....</p>  <pre><code>    FCS = arcpy.ListFeatureClasses()     FCS.sort()     for fc in FCS:             if fc.startswith("Book"):                     DM1 = arcpy.GetCount_management(fc)                     print "\t" + fc +" Record Count = "+  str(DM1)                     # total = sum(str(DM1)) ####  my effort to return sum                     # print "Book_** Record Count = " +total     # and the number of feature classes (In case there were hundreds)     fcCount = len(FCS)     print '\n' '\t' "FeatureClasses found = " + str(fcCount) </code></pre>  <p>Produces this result ....</p>  <pre><code>15_Books_Base_count.py starts here......  Book_10 Record Count = 841 Book_20 Record Count = 209 Book_30 Record Count = 56 Book_40 Record Count = 32182 Book_50 Record Count = 40178 Book_60 Record Count = 8562 Book_70 Record Count = 2118 Book_80 Record Count = 6413 Book_90 Record Count = 645  FeatureClasses found = 11 </code></pre>  <p>I am after a returned line that has "Book_** Record Count = 91204".</p>
