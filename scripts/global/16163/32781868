<p>So I have a type:</p>  <pre><code>create or replace TYPE t_text IS TABLE OF VARCHAR2(200) </code></pre>  <p>And a function, that uses t_text type for a  input value, but this</p>  <pre><code>function( (SELECT CAST(MULTISET(SELECT column_name FROM table_name) AS T_TEXT)  FROM DUAL) ) </code></pre>  <p>is not working properly. I can't create the collection before, because this function is used in a view. Is there any workaround?</p>  <p><strong>Edit:</strong> Actually, the precise problem is that in</p>  <pre><code>select multiple_replace(    'text',    CAST(MULTISET(SELECT column_name1 FROM table_name) AS T_TEXT),    CAST(MULTISET(SELECT column_name2 FROM table_name) AS T_TEXT)  ) A from dual;  </code></pre>  <p>the elements in two colletions are not in the same order as they were in the table. So the results are different from creating collections with <strong>bulk collect</strong>, that I can't use for the view.</p>
