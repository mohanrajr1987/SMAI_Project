<p>I'm kinda new in oracle forms, I've created a dynamic list item as the textbook says exactly between two tables (patients and doctors), dr_id is foreign key in the patients table and I want to show the  dr's name instead of the dr id in the patients table form, and that is done but when I insert, the dr_id is not inserted in the patients table instead it it is null.</p>  <pre><code>patients table (patient_id,dr_id(foreign key),etc.) doctors table (dr_id(primary key)   type =&gt; number,dr_name type =&gt; varhar2,etc..). </code></pre>  <p>If there is any thing vague please tell me. </p>
