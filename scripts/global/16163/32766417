<p>This is my 2nd day working with XML and I have run in to an error message question.</p>  <p>I have a file that is creating an error in Oracle 10g BPEL.  When the file is processed I am getting the following error: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/gIBWV.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/gIBWV.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>My question is the @146b11e4 some kind of location?</p>  <p>If it is, is that location someplace I can access or will I need to parse the file and determine what value is returning the 'zero node' and go from there?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>  <p>EDIT: I did some more looking and the next summary has some more information: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/IruPg.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/IruPg.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>If I understand this and the Spec correct there is a [null] somewhere in the incoming file that shouldn't be there.</p>
