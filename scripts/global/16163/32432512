<p>We are using Oracle 10g for project.</p>  <p>Given -</p>  <ol> <li>one model(for example - Foo).</li> <li>Columns for table - 'id'(sys_generated), 'name'.</li> <li>No index declared on 'name' column.</li> </ol>  <p>We are using Like operator for searching on name column of Foo.</p>  <p>Method on Foo model -</p>  <pre><code>def autocomplete(term)          where("LOWER(name) LIKE '%#{ term.downcase }%'") end </code></pre>  <p>Problem - There are nearly 300 records. It takes 3-4 secs to get result from query. And it varies for each string. For example - 'Bath' takes 4 secs &amp; 'sal' takes 7secs </p>  <p>Please let us know how we can optimize the search result as I am new to Oracle? At least, it should be consistent? </p>
