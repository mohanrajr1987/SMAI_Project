<p>Is it possible to downgrade oracle 11.1.0.6.0 to 10.2.0.4.0? The Compatible parameter need to be changed to "10.2.0"? Today I have Compatible set to 10.2.0.4.0.</p>  <p>It's not clear on support.oracle if I need to change or not. This document  <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/upgrade/upgrade11gr2-downgrade-methods-179029.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/upgrade/upgrade11gr2-downgrade-methods-179029.pdf</a></p>  <p>state:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The major restriction on the downgrade script is that it cannot be run   if the COMPATIBLE parameter has been raised as part of, or after, the   upgrade. This is because raising the COMPATIBLE parameter will allow   on-disk changes that cannot be understood by the earlier version of   Oracle Database. For this reason, downgrades from Oracle Database 11g   Release 2 to Oracle Database 9i are not supported. Downgrades from   Oracle Database 11g Release 2 to the following versions are supported:    10.1.0.5  10.2.0.2, 10.2.0.3, 10.2.0.4, 10.2.0.5  11.1.0.6,   11.1.0.7</p> </blockquote>  <p>but this one  <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/server.112/e17222/downgrade.htm#UPGRD12554" rel="nofollow">http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/server.112/e17222/downgrade.htm#UPGRD12554</a></p>  <p>says:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>If you are downgrading to Oracle Database 10g Release 2 (10.2), then   the COMPATIBLE initialization parameter must be set to 10.2.0 or   lower.</p> </blockquote>  <p>thx</p>
