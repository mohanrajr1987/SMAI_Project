<p>I am required to make a form which will contain important keywords and their description, with the possibility to search between the words. It is loaded from the <code>Help</code> menu and it is designed to give the users detailed help informations about other components. (Just like every application's Help menu)</p>  <p>I only used forms to query tables, and I was wondering, what is the correct way to achieve this? Does Oracle support any feature that would auto-generate a help-form based on my 'Help' inputs from Property Palettes? or do I have to manually write data into a canvas? if so, how can I search through it?</p>  <p>I considered creating a table and writing help informations in it, but I don't think that is the correct way.</p>
