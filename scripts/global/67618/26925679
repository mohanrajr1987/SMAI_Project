<p>I am working on asp.net mvc2 application. Problem is that when i am displaying date in format <code>MM/dd/yyyy</code> application work, but i must display the date in format <code>dd/MM/yyyy</code> to user. I set date in this format, but then i have problem with web service because it expect date format in <code>MM/dd/yyyy</code>, and i always get an error.</p>  <p>First i thought to write simple method that would convert date from one format to another ,and display in <code>dd/MM/yyyy</code> . But i have to match methods that use date, and i will have to make changes at many places.</p>  <p>I tried to use globalization in web config file like </p>  <pre><code>​    &lt;system.web&gt; ​​        &lt;globalization               requestEncoding="utf-8"              responseEncoding="utf-8"              culture="en-GB"              uiCulture="en-GB"          /&gt;     &lt;/system.web&gt; </code></pre>  <p>But that did not work for me. Is there some way to change date format when i display to the user, and then web service can accept it? </p>  <p>Thanks</p>
