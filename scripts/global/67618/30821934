<p>Im developing a project where Im using Ext.Net along with Asp.Net MVC2. It works fine running it on a development environment, but when I publish it on a remote server every javascript file is empty. I dont have any problem with aspx files, CSS or images... Just Javascript. If I write the javascript code in the .aspx file it works, but not on a detached .JS file. Any idea? Thanks in avance.</p>
