<p>I am trying to create partial view for editing configurable list of fields. This list will be created based on configuration and some input parameters as an ajax call. What I want to achieve is to have regex validation for these fields where rules will be stored in configuration. If this was not the case, I would just iterate through a list of field names and create inputs for them all, but since validation is requirement I'd like to somehow use MVC validation engine. Any suggestions how to achieve this using .net 3.5 and MVC2?</p>
