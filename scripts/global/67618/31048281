<p>I got a MVC2 project that I would like to upgrade to MVC5.  I would like to use the new asp.net owin and asp.net identity.  How ever if I would go ahead and make a new asp.net MVC5 project I would probably need to redo my database. And my database is rather big and complex, would it be possible somehow to generate new controllers from my existing database ? </p>  <p>Or would it just be easier to stick with the current login system I already use ? (asp.net mvc2) </p>
