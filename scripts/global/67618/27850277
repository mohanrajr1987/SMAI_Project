<p>I currently have Visual Studio 2010 on Windows Server Standard with SP2, 32-bit OS in the company where I work.</p>  <p>Projects are developed under Visual Studio .NET 2003, Visual Studio 2005, 2008 and 2010. The oldest version of ASP.NET MVC I have is 2.</p>  <p>If I install ASP.NET MVC 4 Web Application from asp.net website, would it change any existing settings on my PC that might break working projects?</p>  <p>Thank you </p>
