<p><strong>PLAN 1 and PLAN 2</strong> are pricing plans in our site.</p>  <p><strong>PLAN 1</strong>--> can view  / open the contact details as per the plan <strong>(min 25)</strong></p>  <p><strong>PLAN 2</strong>-->  New register resumes will send automatically to the User <strong>(min 25)</strong></p>  <p>So i am maintaining two fields in table , <strong>ValidityCount (25)</strong>, <strong>RemainingCount (25)</strong> -->every time open details, remaining count will reduce. once come 0 it will stop open. This is the logic now working.</p>  <p>Now <strong>PLAN 3</strong> is the new plan. --> combination of <strong>PLAN 1 AND PLAN 2</strong>.. Total - <strong>50 counts..</strong></p>  <p>How will i split this total <strong>50 counts</strong> to each plans... Each plans are decreasing in a same field which means 25 count should go to PLAN 1 and 25 count should go to PLAN 2. </p>  <p>Please give me ideas or suggestions.. Is this possible to do this?</p>
