<p>I am using ADFS 2.0 as authentication process for the application which is developed using asp.net mvc2 and SQL Server 2012. In order to resolve the issue: Clickjacking (aka Cross-Site Framing or XSF), we have set  the X-Frame-Options with value DENY in the web.config file.</p>  <p>Steps to reproduce: 1. Logged into the application using valid credentials using Chrome browser. 2. System displayed me the application landing page. 3. Clicked F12 to open the Developer Tools options. 4. Now clicked on Signout option and navigated to the Console window. 5. System displayed the ADFS Signout page, but still I am getting an error in the Console window as mentioned below:</p>  <p>Refused to display '<a href="https://mytestwebsite.com/?wa=wsignoutcleanup1.0" rel="nofollow">https://mytestwebsite.com/?wa=wsignoutcleanup1.0</a>' in a frame because it set 'X-Frame-Options' to 'DENY'.</p>  <p>On checking the ViewSource of the ADFS Sognout page I came to see the following:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;iframe class="Test" src="https://mytestwebsite.com/?wa=wsignoutcleanup1.0"&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Can anyone suggest me the best possible ways to resolve the above issue?</p>
