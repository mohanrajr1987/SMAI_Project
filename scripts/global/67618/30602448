<p>I'm using <strong>MVC 2.0</strong> project - this project is being supported but there are no current plans to upgrade to 4.0 and beyond at this point. So there are several enhancements that I'm tweaking.</p>  <p>Is it possible to render HTML elements via the displayname attribute of my model with a helper?</p>  <p>For example:</p>  <pre><code>[DataMember] [ValidateIntNotNegative] [DisplayName("How many students have &lt;b&gt;no&lt;/b&gt; immunization record or valid exemption 0-17 months of age?")] public int PartOne_Enroll_HaveNoImmune { get; set; } </code></pre>  <p>Look at the word "no" - it should be in bold. Thus it should read on the screen:</p>  <p>How many students have <b>no</b> immunization record or valid exemption 0-17 months of age?"</p>
