<p>Hello fellow programmers!</p>  <p>I am currently stuck in a school assignment.  I am working with ASP.NET, MVC2 (I know, it's old :( )  Here is the situation:  I have a controller who will decide with an if statement what view to return.  For example:</p>  <p>Here is a method within my controller:</p>  <pre><code>public ActionResult Verification() {     String lastName = Request["lastName"];     String name = Request["name"];     String dob = Request["dob"];     String phone = Request["phone"];     String selection = Request["selection"];      Verification verifying = new Verification(lastName, name, dob, phone, selection);      String other = verifying.returnIfGood();      if (!(other == ""))     {         return RedirectToAction("probleme1");     }     else     {         return RedirectToAction("probleme2");     } } </code></pre>  <p>RedirectToAction seem to point directly at a view, but I also need to pass the view a string to work with.  I also noticed if I call a method within my controller, no view gets returned, which I am a little confused about.  I am trying to stay away from ajax and jquery since I haven't seen those yet.  Is there any way to do this using only c#?</p>
