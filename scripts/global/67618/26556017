<p>I have a model that looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>[Serializable] public class Question : RatingItem, IQuestion, IXmlSerializable { // ...     public int TextRows { get; set; } </code></pre>  <p>And when I send it back to the controller via a post, Fiddler captured it like this:</p>  <pre><code>...Question.TextRows=44... </code></pre>  <p>But then on the very first line in my controller my break point says this value is 0.</p>  <pre><code>    [HttpPost]     [RequiresResource(SecurityConstants.IndividualOverview_Configuration, eActions.AddNew | eActions.Update)]     public ActionResult Save(int documentId, string evaluationVariableName, Question question)     { </code></pre>  <p>// question.TextRows is 0 here ...</p>  <p>Any guesses about what is going on?</p>  <p>I inherited this code, but I don't see any custom model binders that could be adjusting things.</p>  <p>What's even weirder is all the other properties percolate to the controller just fine.</p>
