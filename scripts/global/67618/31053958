<p>I have one MVC2 site that does not display the images and css or allow a user to login. All the other MVC 2 sites are working fine and have the exact same settings for the application pool. I'm using IIS8.5 and windows server 2012 R2.</p>  <p><strong>Application Pool Settings</strong></p>  <ul> <li><p>Managed Pipeline Mode: Integrated</p></li> <li><p>Identity: Application Pool Identity</p></li> </ul>  <p>The website works correctly on my own PC.</p>  <p>Does anyone know how to fix this?</p>
