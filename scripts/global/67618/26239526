<p>I am creating a MVC 2 website. I'm a beginner. I created a Model to use EF. The relationship is between a user table and a product table (one to many relationship). I am able to create new users and save them on the DB using linq to entities. My question is how do I add a product to an existing user. I was starting with the code below but it does not work. Intellisense doesn't see the querryuser.Product whats wrong with my code or what is the right way to do it. If someone can help me it would be great </p>  <pre><code> public void Insert(Product obj)     {         if (HttpContext.Current.Session["userid"] != null)         {             string userid2 = HttpContext.Current.Session["userid"].ToString();              var queryuser = from p in entities.Users                             where p.UserID == userid2                             select p;              queryuser.Product.Add(obj);             entities.Users.Add(queryuser);             entities.SaveChanges();          }                                                              } </code></pre>  <p>I am calling this method from my controller. </p>
