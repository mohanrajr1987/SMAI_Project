<p>So i have given an old project from my manager to upgrade it to new version on .net and MVC. So i checked the project file and refrerence of my system.web.mvc and found that the project is in .Net 4 and MVC 2.0. Now we need to upgrade it to .net4 MVC 4.5. I looked at bunch of documents but kind of skeptic which to follow and whats the best practice. </p>  <p>Can anyone tell me whats the best way to do it seamlessly.</p>
