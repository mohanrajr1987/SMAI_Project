<p>I have many text strings in source code. I want to move them to resources (may be separated, but in one place for whole project). But, I want group them by text group. In my program are many different types of string: for financial part, for admin management, for Welcome page and so on. And I want to have possibility use them in appropriate way. For example (hypothetical): </p>  <pre><code>var message = string.Empty; if (user.IsAdmin) {     message = Resources.Financial.AdminWelcome; } else {     message = Resources.Financial.UserWelcome; } </code></pre>  <p>So, how can I create grouped resources? I want to use them like: <code>Resources.</code><strong>MainMessagesGroup</strong>.<strong>MessegesGroup</strong>.<strong>Text</strong>. And I want to save auto localization.</p>  <p><strong>P.S.</strong> Please, if the question was asked early (but, I didn't found it) - do not minus this one, but write the comments and I will delete this one. And sorry for mistakes if I made ​​them. Maybe, someone can help me to fix them.</p>
