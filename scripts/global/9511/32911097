<p>This is quite odd. I'm not at all sure why I'm getting this error. I deleted the derived data already and I'm not else quite sure where this error is coming from.</p>  <p>This is the first time I've seen it. It used to show up when running my simulator and now it's showing up when running on my phone.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Idlrn.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Idlrn.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/dUn8G.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/dUn8G.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
