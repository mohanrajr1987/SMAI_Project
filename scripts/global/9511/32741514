<p>I'm getting the wellknown "Bitmap too large to be uploaded into a texture".</p>  <pre><code>Bitmap too large to be uploaded into a texture (3069x4320, max=4096x4096) </code></pre>  <p>While debugging I was commenting out parts, until I found everything relevant commented out. No images were used in the stripped-down code.</p>  <p>I still got the same error, so.. how can I know which bitmap the LogCat is talking about? Is there some kind of library which can leave me clues?</p>
