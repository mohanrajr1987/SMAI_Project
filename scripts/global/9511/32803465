<p>I am trying to output a list of every possible 6 length combination of with the alphabet and numbers.</p>  <p>I have tried MANY different types of codes to this, and this one seems to be the best but it doesn't work for the long length I am using it for.</p>  <pre><code>import itertools import pprint letters = ["A","B","C","D","E","F","G","H","I","J","K","L","M",           "N","O","P","Q","R","S","T","U","V","W","X","Y","Z",           "0","1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9"] pprint.pprint(list(itertools.product(letters, repeat=6))) </code></pre>  <p>When I run this, I get this error:</p>  <pre><code>MemoryError </code></pre>  <p>It does work with repeat set as anything less than 5.</p>  <p>How can I fix this? Is there an easier or better way to get the same result? Would it be possible to just output this to a text file instead of having to print it? I don't care if there are repeats or not, but it would be preferred if there aren't any.</p>  <p>This site: textmechanic.com/Combination-Generator.html also does the same thing I want, but it doesn't work with the large amount of objects I am using and the length of the combinations. If there is already a list like this, that would do.</p>  <p>Or is it just impossible to get this done?</p>
