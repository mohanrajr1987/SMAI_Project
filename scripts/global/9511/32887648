<p>I have an application built on Framework 2.0. currently on production, it is running on 32 bit register. However 3 days ago, on my local machine, using VS 2012 I changed the target platforms of every project in solution from Any CPU to x64. I have even changed the Platform in Configuration Manager of solution from Any CPU to x64. Now after doing that, I started to get this runtime error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>"Could not load file or assembly 'XXX.Common, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null' or one of its dependencies. An attempt was made to load a program with an incorrect format."</p> </blockquote>  <p>I have checked many threads from stackoverflow and some other forums, but all the suggestion went in vain. </p>  <p>Note*: The reason to change it from Any CPU to x64 is: on production server, on after 2,3 days the application starts to destroy and the following exception starts to occur:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>OutOfMemory Exception.</p> </blockquote>  <p>On some forums, it was suggested to build it on x64 because .Net framework allocates only 2 GB on x86 for .Net application, while in x64, 4 GB is allocated. (correct me if I am wrong).</p>  <p>Please give me any suggestion about any of the above issue, so that I can avoid these exceptions.</p>  <p>Regards</p>
