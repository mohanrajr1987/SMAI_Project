<p>My app runs fine in versions older or newer than 5.0.X. In that version I always get out of memory error, I double checked and I know my app it's not the problem but the memory leak bug.</p>  <p>I will not provide code because it happens in any moment, in any activity so it's pointless to provide hundreds of lines for nothing.</p>  <p>The only I can say is that always happens when loading images (setImageResource).</p>  <p>It's there something we can do to remove or at least reduce this problem?</p>  <p>Thanks a lot.</p>
