<p>I'm not from Java background, but I need to work with an application that gives this very common out of memory error. I followed the steps in this link <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Increase-Java-Memory-in-Windows-7" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Increase-Java-Memory-in-Windows-7</a> but instead of <code>-Xms</code>, I've used <code>-Xmx</code> to set only the max allocation rather than the initial allocation.</p>  <p>However, this affected other Java apps <strong>negatively</strong>. They simply don't start for no obvious reason. </p>  <p>I say <strong><em>other apps</em></strong> shouldn't be affected as long as they don't reach the limit and I know they can <strong>never</strong> reach the limit I set.</p>  <p>So, why are they affected?</p>
