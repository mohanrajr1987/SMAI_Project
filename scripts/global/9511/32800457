<p>I am trying to use <code>keytool</code> on a Windows System which is a part of my JDK1.8 install. I got an <code>OutOfMemoryError</code>. I was wondering if there is an option to increase the heap size like <code>-Xmx</code> used with the JVM. I tried that but the -X option was not recognized.</p>  <p>Here is the command I used:</p>  <pre><code>keytool -list -keystore c:\myfolder\myp12file.p12 -storetype PKCS12 </code></pre>  <p>Just a note, I was able to use the windows "certutil -dump" to dump the contents of the keystore, which is similar to <code>keytool -list</code>.</p>
