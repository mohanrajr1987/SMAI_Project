<p>I have developed a java program which i have deployed on remote machine and it has latest jre1.8.0_60 installed. I have developed the program using jdk1.8.0_60. I have tested the program on my machine (memory 6GB-64bit) and on my colleagues computer (memory 8GB-64bit) and the program executed without any problem but when i execute the same program on remote machine(memory 4GB-64BIT) it throws this error:</p>  <pre><code>   java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space    Dumping heap to java_pid3696.hprof ...    Heap dump file created [217326007 bytes in 2.721 secs]     Exception in thread "main" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space     at java.util.Arrays.copyOfRange(Unknown Source)     at java.lang.String.&lt;init&gt;(Unknown Source)     at java.lang.StringBuilder.toString(Unknown Source)     at Invoice.GetInvoicesByStatusAndDate(Invoice.java:66)     at ClientSAAJ.GetInvoicesByStatusAndDate(ClientSAAJ.java:75)     at ClientSAAJ.main(ClientSAAJ.java:10) </code></pre>  <p>Could it be that there is not enough ram or do i have carry out some sort of java configuration?</p>
