<p>Ok i'm confused. What is the difference between the two? I've been working with a pre-made database imported in the assets folders and been using images in my listview and been getting errors about outofmemory while scrolling down. I read different ways to handle it, but can really understand some tutorials, then i read something about cursorloader and loadermanager something and that it can solve my problem on the outofmemory error. Is that how it really work? I saw alot of tutorials but mostly points out to data insertion so i got confused. </p>
