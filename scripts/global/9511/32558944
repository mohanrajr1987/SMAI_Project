<p>I have an <a href="https://github.com/k3b/AndroFotoFinder/" rel="nofollow">app</a> that can among others zoom  images using <a href="https://github.com/chrisbanes/PhotoView" rel="nofollow">chris bane's PhotoView</a>.</p>  <p>When i load large images i get "OutOfMemoryError"</p>  <p>When i add this </p>  <pre><code>     &lt;application ... android:largeHeap="true"&gt; </code></pre>  <p>to AndroidManifest.xml</p>  <p>I get a more specific error message with my android-4.4 device </p>  <pre><code>    Bitmap too large to be uploaded into a texture (7087x1022, max=4096x4096) </code></pre>  <p>My question: is there an api (or something else) that tells me that my current android device has a limit of 4096x4096 ?</p>
