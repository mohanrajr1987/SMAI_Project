<p>I am looking for a way to render a high resolution screenshot for print. The goal is to let the user arrange different pictures on a full resolution background image and save this. Saving to JPEG is easy, but to show the big view makes trouble.</p>  <p>At the moment I have a Layout with fixed Pixel-Size 2000x1500px and scale it down to the visible Screen. Then I get a Bitmap out of this View like this:</p>  <pre><code>public static Bitmap loadBitmapFromView(View v) {     Bitmap b = Bitmap.createBitmap( v.getLayoutParams().width,             v.getLayoutParams().height, Bitmap.Config.ARGB_8888);     v.layout(0, 0, v.getLayoutParams().width, v.getLayoutParams().height);     v.draw(new Canvas(b));     return b; } </code></pre>  <p>This works perfect on new devices, but on some older with small memory I run into OOM on showing the background with full resolution or if I add many small ImageViews to my Layout.</p>  <p>I tried it with BitmapOptions.inSampleSize of 2 or 4, but quality is too poor for print.</p>  <p>Maybe there is some better way or a native library to achieve this? </p>
