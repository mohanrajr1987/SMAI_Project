<p>Numerous answers and comments on SO claim that using <code>std::stack</code> is pretty much useless, but don't really give a reason other than "Use a <code>std::vector</code> or <code>std::deque</code> instead."</p>  <p>Why? What's wrong with it?</p>  <p>Evidence of Claims:</p>  <ul> <li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/32805305/421178">Answer claiming using vector or deque is better.</a></li> <li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/525377/421178">Answer claiming just use straight deque for iteration (see also comments).</a></li> <li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/20038796/421178">Answer directly claiming stack is useless.</a></li> <li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/13428635/421178">Answer claims vector is just as usable in addition to accessing inner elements</a></li> </ul>
