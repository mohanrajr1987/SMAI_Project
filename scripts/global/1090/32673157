<p>I have written a balanced symbol checker with stacks. Everything else works and I have fully tested all functions like pop push destroy isempty. The problem is my fgets usage.</p>  <pre><code>//fgets char input[10]; printf("Enter a 10 character input for balance: "); fgets(input, 10, stdin); </code></pre>  <p>the part that is "not working" is the following code</p>  <pre><code>int i = 0; for (i &lt; 10; i++;){     if (input[i] == '{' || input[i] == '[' || input[i] == '(' || input[i] == '&lt;'){         push(&amp;st2, input[i]);      } } </code></pre>  <p>I know my push function is working, because i have tested it as a standalone. something like:</p>  <pre><code>push(&amp;st2, '{'); </code></pre>  <p>works perfectly fine when i try to display my stack and correctly pushes the value.  At this point I am thinking that either the initial char array with fgets is just not initializing correctly, or I have somehow managed to screw up the if/for loop. </p>  <p>When I run the program the if statement conditional is never met even if i type a { [ ( or &lt; into stdin. When I try to print our the input[10] char array my program just crashes aswell.</p>
