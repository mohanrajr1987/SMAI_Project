<p>I've noticed that, in ubuntu 12.04 x64, all programs map stack segment to virtual address range like:</p>  <pre><code>7fff0f59b000-7fff0f5bc000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0      [stack] </code></pre>  <p>Since 0xbc000 - 0x9b000 = 0x21000 = 135168, the size  is much smaller than the value given by ulimit -s (8192KB)</p>  <p>Could you tell me why? Will stack segment grow automatically up to 8MB limit? Thank you in advance.</p>
