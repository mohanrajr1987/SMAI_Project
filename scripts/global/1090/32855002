<p>I am beginning in C programming(<strong>using C,not C++</strong>)and im wondering how I could save data from a stack to a txt file.The stack contains integers only.Heres what I did so far:</p>  <pre><code>void saving() {  FILE *thefile = fopen("thestack.txt", "w"); while (attop != NULL)   //top element     {     fwrite(attop, sizeof(char), sizeof(attop), thefile);     fclose(thefile);      } } </code></pre>  <p>However this just enter the error case of my program and display error.Im not sure quite how to do that</p>  <p>thank you</p>
