<p>I have to implement a program using the Stack class which allows a user to enter a positive integer,<code>n</code>, followed by <code>n</code> integers. Then the program should allow the user to enter another integer, <code>val</code> after which the program should display the last value which is greater than <code>val</code>. From my understanding of the program, I figured out that it should compare each element from the top of the stack to the <code>val</code>. Therefore to compare each element to <code>val</code>, it should iterate through the values in the stack starting from the top. I don't really know how to make this work so would be pleased if I could get any help. Here is my program:</p>  <pre><code>import java.util.*; public class MyClass{  public static void main(String[] args) {      Scanner sc= new Scanner(System.in);      Stack&lt;Integer&gt; NumsInStack= new Stack&lt;Integer&gt;();      int n, num, val;     System.out.println("Please enter n.");     n=sc.nextInt();      for(int i=0; i&lt;n;i++){          num=sc.nextInt();         NumsInStack.push(num);      }      System.out.println("Enter a value.");     val=sc.nextInt();      for(int i=0; i&lt;NumsInStack.size();i++){           if(NumsInStack.peek()&gt;val)             System.out.println("The number greater than "+val+" is "+NumsInStack.peek());      }     } }         </code></pre>
