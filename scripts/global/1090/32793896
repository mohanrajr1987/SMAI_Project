<p>I'm currently following the erratas for the <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/047008023X" rel="nofollow">Shellcoder's Handbook (2nd edition)</a>.  The book is a little outdated but pretty good still. My problem right now is that I can't guess how long my payload needs to be I tried to follow every step (and run gdb with the same arguments) and I tried to guess where the buffer starts, but I don't know exactly. I'm kind of new to this too so it makes sense.</p>  <p>I have a vulnerable program with <code>strcpy()</code> and a <code>buffer[512]</code>. I want to make the stack overflow, so I run some A's with the program (as the Erratas for the Shellcoders Handbook). I want to find how long the payload needs to be (no ASLR) so in theory I just need to find where the buffer is.</p>  <p>Since I'm new I can't post an image, but the preferred output from the book has a full 4 row of 'A's (0x41414141), and mine is like this:</p>  <pre><code>(gdb) x/20xw $esp - 532          0xbffff968 : 0x0000000  0xbfffffa0e 0x41414141 0x41414141 0xbffff968   0x41414141 0x41414141  0x00004141 0x0804834 </code></pre>  <p>What address is that? How I know where this buffer starts? I want to do this so I can keep working with the book. I realize that the buffer is somewhere in there because of the A's that I ran. But if I want to find how long the payload needs to be I need the point where it starts.</p>
