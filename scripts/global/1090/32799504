<p>I am writing a program that generates a maze and then finds a path. I store all my moves into a stack called <code>visitStack</code> (if I move north, I store "N" into it, if Northeast then "NE", on and on). For part of my backtracking I need to be able to take the data from the stack and reverse my steps if I hit a dead end, but I've hit a snag here.</p>  <p>I need to assign a value popped from a stack to a <code>String</code> variable, but I always get a compiler error. I've tried using <code>toString</code>, instantiating the String as an object with the popped stack value as the parameter, and still can't get it. I've been on this for about an hour. Here is the code and error message.</p>  <pre><code>String direction = visitStack.pop(); </code></pre>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/SMURT.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/SMURT.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
