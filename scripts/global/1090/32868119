<p>I appreciate that this is a moving target, however. I have attempted to manage my VSO backlog using both the Drag and Drop functionality and the Stack Rank Approach. On 2015 09 25 i noted along with a coworker that either manner resulted in sparcification which did not leave the backlog in the same order in which i had placed it.</p>  <p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudioalm/archive/2014/05/14/behind-the-scenes-the-backlog-priority-or-stack-rank-field.aspx?wa=wsignin1.0" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudioalm/archive/2014/05/14/behind-the-scenes-the-backlog-priority-or-stack-rank-field.aspx?wa=wsignin1.0</a></p>  <p>The issue from MSDN does not indicate that this is designed behavior however when my backlog is consistently 300 items having a random order applied to my backlog causes havoc on a daily basis. In fact i was fairly certain it was sabotage.</p>  <ol> <li>Has anyone else noted this.</li> <li>is there a way to over come this issue. Links or other guidance will be truly appreciated</li> </ol>  <p>I have used both Excel and the "edit work item" feature to change the stack  rank.</p>  <p>what i have observed is this</p>  <p>Lets say i have only 5 items in my backlog ( i actually have 300)+</p>  <p>I set the stack rank of the first 3 items to be equal so thay clump together</p>  <h3>work item |stackrank| Order</h3>  <ol> <li>| 1 | 1</li> <li>| 1 | 2</li> <li>| 1 | 3</li> <li>| 2 | 4</li> <li>| 9 | 5</li> </ol>  <p>For 5 minutes that is the order i see on the webpage ( if i was not clear my VSO is hosted on Azure)</p>  <p>After a certain time ( it happens almost immediately) the sparcification does this ( NOTE order as well as stackrank) *keeping number sane on purpose althougt i know that MS uses much larger ordination</p>  <h3>work item |stackrank| Order</h3>  <ol start="3"> <li>| 1 | 1</li> <li>| 3 | 2</li> <li>| 5 | 3</li> <li>| 7 | 4</li> <li>| 9 | 5</li> </ol>  <p>So why does it not respect my clumping strategy?</p>  <p>I have been watching the backlog with a skeptical eye for the last week and it is appears to be reordering items without human intervention.I cannot be completely certain , however i am the backlog owner and 99% of the time ppl fess up when they add items without prior conversation. ( it happens in my organization and wont be stopped <em>shrug</em>)</p>
