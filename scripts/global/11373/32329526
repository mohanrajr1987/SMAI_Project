<p>I have a ScrollView (containing a NSTextEditor) whose top, left and right constraints I've correctly set to 0 relative to its container (the main window).</p>  <p>I can't get its height to be half of the main container. Any help?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/m22GK.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/m22GK.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
