<p>I have a single view App. very basic not much going on right now besides networking code. </p>  <p>Earlier in the day I committed changes to the main view (added buttons, text fields, styling). I did this by copy+paste -ing from an old project. Everything worked as I expected.</p>  <p>Now, I am on a different machine and pulled the changes in. The App is building with the "old" view (just a single button). Why is it not showing the changes that I made, and were working, earlier?</p>  <p>EDIT: its not just the view that isnt updating. Its running all of the old code from my previous commit. Again, the problem is that I have all up to date files. </p>  <p>this is a Swift app, if it matters.</p>
