<p>I'm a little bit confused what is a <strong>proper</strong> way to create custom view in xib. I've made some research and there are two ways to achieve it.</p>  <p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>  <p>I create view, let's name it CustomView. I set the class of view in xib to CustomView and in the implementation file I create helper function to create this view, for example:</p>  <pre><code>- (instancetype)customView {   NSArray *views = [NSBundle mainBundle] loadNibNamed:@"CustomView" owner:nil options:nil];   CustomView *customView = views.firstObject;   return customView; } </code></pre>  <p>customization code goes to awakeFromNib.</p>  <p><strong>Method 2:</strong> I create view the same way as in the first method. But I set the class to the xib files owner, not to the view. The code:</p>  <pre><code>- (instancetype)initWithCoder:(NSCoder *)aDecoder {     self = [super initWithCoder:aDecoder];     if (self) {         [self loadView];     }     return self; }  - (void)loadView {     NSArray *views = [[NSBundle bundleForClass:[self class]] loadNibNamed:@"CustomView" owner:self options:nil];     UIView *view = views.firstObject;     view.frame = self.bounds;     [self addSubview:view]; } </code></pre>  <p>What is the proper way? What are the difference? Why in second method do we have to set the frame of view to the self.bounds? Is it safe? What about rotation? Shouldn't we use autolayout? </p>
