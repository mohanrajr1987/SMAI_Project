<p>I have a view-based <code>NSOutlineView</code> that I am providing a custom view (a subclass of <code>NSTableCellView</code>) for one of the columns.  I am registering this subview using:</p>  <pre><code>let nib = NSNib(nibNamed: "MyMatcherView", bundle: NSBundle.mainBundle()) outlineView.registerNib(nib, forIdentifier: "matcher") </code></pre>  <p>When I call <code>outline.makeViewWithIdentifier("matcher")</code>, it successfully returns me an instance of my custom view. Yay!</p>  <p>In Interface Builder, though, I've noticed that I can totally delete the <code>NSTableCellView</code> control from the <code>matcher</code> column (see below).  </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/WgiVt.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/WgiVt.png" alt="Table view in Interface Builder"></a></p>  <p>Two questions arise:</p>  <ul> <li>I assume that it works at runtime because the call to <code>registerNib()</code> tells the table to use that nib, instead of the one that would have been defined by Interface Builder. Is this correct?</li> <li>In the context of me providing a custom view, what is the <code>Text Cell</code> control that you can see in the screenshot below. I can't delete it, and I am not really sure what it is representing.</li> </ul>
