<p>I don't understand how having together left and right orizontal constraints together.. I still don't understand the exact mechanism beyond interface builder, its constraints and the effective results on the simulator: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZT8DJ.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZT8DJ.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I expected the label "ingredienti" in the center of my view (like my input text above with same type of constraints).. Why does it go outside my "screen" in simulation preview? </p>
