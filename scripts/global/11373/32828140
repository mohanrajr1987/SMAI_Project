<p>There are a myriad of settings for <code>NSAttributedParagraphStyle</code> that I can see in Interface Builder:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/vw2Pp.png" width="250"> <img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/UZjrZ.png" width="250"></p>  <p>But none of these are for text kerning. Is there a way to adjust the text kerning in Xcode 7's Interface Builder for attributed text? </p>  <p><sub>(Please don't answer with how to do this in code - I already know how to do that!)</sub></p>
