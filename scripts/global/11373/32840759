<p>I create a XIB in Xcode and add a simple view as a subview: </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/wuQFY.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/wuQFY.png" alt="XIB with rootview and subview"></a></p>  <p>What I want to achieve is that the subview has a fixed size and the rootview automatically resizes to the size of that subview, leaving a margin of 20.0 around it:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/csEVH.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/csEVH.png" alt="Resized XIB"></a></p>  <p>So I add a fixed width and a fixed height constraint to the subview. Then I add the four constraints for the 20.0 margin:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/thMPp.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/thMPp.png" alt="Constraints"></a> <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/UecCg.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/UecCg.png" alt="View showing constraints"></a></p>  <p>As the superview does not have any constraints there should be neither ambiguity nor conflicting constraints: I would expect the superview to shrink down in order to match the constraints. However, Xcode complains:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/a9sHR.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/a9sHR.png" alt="Warnings"></a></p>  <p>These constraints would only be conflicting if the rootview had a fixed size and that appears to be the case. So my question is: <strong>How can I make the rootview of a XIB flexible so that it dynamically adjusts its size to match its contents?</strong> </p>  <p>(Is that even possible with Interface Builder?)</p>
