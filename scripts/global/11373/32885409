<p>Let's say, in my code, I have adjusted many many IBOutlet (like, frame, border, color, text, etc...), depend on user interaction. Then when things get so messed up, I'd like to let user reset all of them to its base designed from interface-builder (storyboard, xib, nib). </p>  <p>Is it possible to write a few code to reset all subviews (or IBOutlet, as both are fine) in one partical view or I'll have to rewrite everything? (Note that I just want to reset a view's subviews, not the whole view itself).</p>
