<p>I use xib to build the UI for my project. I add many views in a viewcontroller, and each view has subview and contraints. One day I found the views is too much and I want add a scrollview as their parentview. When I do this ,I found I should rebuild all the contraints of the subviews . Does their any quickly method to complete this. the sub element is too much, rebuild the contraints cost too much. </p>
