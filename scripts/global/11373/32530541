<p>I'm using a LaunchScreen.xib file that shows a UIToolbar with a few BarButtonItems. This toolbar and its items are exactly analogous to an equivalent toolbar in the actual app. Theoretically the use of a LaunchScreen.xib file allows iOS to dynamically position screen elements based on the device itself so that there's no need to make mock-ups and screenshots of interfaces on various devices.</p>  <p>The UIToolbar in my LaunchScreen.xib, however, has the buttons positioned wrongly. Here's the resulting launch screen on an iPhone (left) and the app after it has launched (right).</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/EKYwe.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/EKYwe.png" alt="Image during launch"></a><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/iVwds.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/iVwds.png" alt="Image immediately after launch"></a></p>  <p>You can see that the buttons on the outer edge of the first image are touching the sides of the window whereas in the second image they are inset slightly.</p>  <p>How do I make the button positioning on a UIToolbar in a LaunchScreen.xib file match that in a UIToolbar in the main .xib file?</p>
