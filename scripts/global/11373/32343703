<p>Here is an example of the font in the Navigation Bar</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Yz39e.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Yz39e.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>The exact phrase should be "ONDE VOCÊ ESTÁ"</p>  <p>The it is cutting the "Ê" and "Á".</p>  <p>The font I am using is Intro Condensed Light and a free version can be found here: <a href="http://www.fontfabric.com/intro-condensed-free/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fontfabric.com/intro-condensed-free/</a></p>  <p>Any idea how to solve this? Other fonts works just fine.</p>
