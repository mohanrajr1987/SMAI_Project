<p>I am building an FAQ view for our app. I would like to have a single textView containing all of the questions and answers. I have built that up and added a few lines of text for testing. I'd like the questions to be bold and the responses to be normal weight. In IB I was able to do that using attributed text. It even looks correct in IB but when I run the app in the simulator or on device it changes to a system default font.</p>  <p>Screen shot link - <a href="http://i.imgur.com/iDKj6uo.png" rel="nofollow">http://i.imgur.com/iDKj6uo.png</a></p>  <p>This is the debug output --</p>  <pre><code>(lldb) po self.faqTextView.attributedText Test 1:{     NSFont = "&lt;UICTFont: 0x7f91b94bdee0&gt; font-family:     \".HelveticaNeueInterface-Regular\"; font-weight: normal; font-style:     normal; font-size: 14.00pt";     NSParagraphStyle = "Alignment 4, LineSpacing 0, ParagraphSpacing 0,   ParagraphSpacingBefore 0, HeadIndent 0, TailIndent 0, FirstLineHeadIndent 0, LineHeight 0/0, LineHeightMultiple 0, LineBreakMode 0, Tabs (\n    28L,\n    56L,\n    84L,\n    112L,\n    140L,\n    168L,\n    196L,\n    224L,\n    252L,\n    280L,\n    308L,\n    336L\n), DefaultTabInterval 0, Blocks (null), Lists (null), BaseWritingDirection -1, HyphenationFactor 0, TighteningFactor 0, HeaderLevel 0"; } </code></pre>  <p>I also noticed that if I print out all the fonts in the app the one I am trying to use is not listed the same as the others --</p>  <pre><code>2015-09-03 09:23:30.633 [19665:3068968] Font family name = Open Sans 2015-09-03 09:23:30.633 [19665:3068968] Font names = (     "OpenSans-ExtraboldItalic",     "OpenSans-SemiboldItalic",     "OpenSans-Extrabold",     "OpenSans-BoldItalic",     "OpenSans-Italic",     "OpenSans-Semibold",     "OpenSans-Light",     OpenSans,     "OpenSansLight-Italic",     "OpenSans-Bold" ) </code></pre>  <p>I have tried re-adding the font, as well as re-naming the font and adding a second instance of it to the project. That one did not work either.</p>  <p>I followed the instructions on <a href="http://codewithchris.com/common-mistakes-with-adding-custom-fonts-to-your-ios-app/" rel="nofollow">codewithchris</a> (multiple times) to make sure that I added the fonts in correctly but still unable to get this to work. </p>  <p>If I change the font to a built-in font like helvetica neue bold and regular everything appears correctly in IB and the simulator. </p>  <p>I know there is an open radar for a similar bug but from what I have been able to find it was fixed in the Xcode 7 betas but from my testing I am still having the same issue. Also because of the strange output in the font list I think it may have to do with the font itself.</p>
