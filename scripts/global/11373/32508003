<p>When I touch on a cell in a table view, I collapse the cell. But when it collapses, I just want the title to show (the first line of text in bold). </p>  <p>Right now when it collapses, it's cutting off the top and bottom of the label. Does anyone know how I can use auto layout constraints to ensure this label keeps its form and the rest just either collapse to nothing, or stay off view?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/PdSRW.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/PdSRW.png" alt="table view"></a></p>
