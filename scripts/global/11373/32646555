<p>I want to have my InterfaceController halt all its' ongoing activity (like running timers etc.) when the user backgrounds the app, and resume once it comes back to the foreground. But I'm not sure how I'm supposed to communicate between ExtensionDelegate (which has those functions), and InterfaceController. I don't use Storyboard or Interface Builder for my iOS apps so this is sort of new to me.</p>
