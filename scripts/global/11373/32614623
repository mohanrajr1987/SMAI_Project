<p>I come from an Objective-C background and I'm currently in the process of getting into Swift a bit more. All seems to be going well at the moment but I've hit a slight annoyance. In Objective-C, I used to be able to assign multiple IBOutlets on one line like so: </p>  <pre><code>@property (nonatomic, weak) IBOutlet UITextField *emailField, *passwordField; </code></pre>  <p>So I'd like to do the same in Swift, rather than having a line for every single view. I've tried: </p>  <pre><code>@IBOutlet weak var emailField, passwordField : UITextField? </code></pre>  <p>Which seems like legal Swift code, the app compiles, but in Interface Builder I can only see the emailField outlet. </p>  <p>My question is, can this be done in Swift? If so how?</p>
