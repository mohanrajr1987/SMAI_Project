<p>I have a scroll view that contains different options for logging into an application.</p>  <p>There are two buttons that I would like to anchor to the bottom of the view, unless the view becomes too small, then the view should scroll.</p>  <p>Having no constraint between "Login" and "Facebook" expectedly results in the infamous "ambiguous content height". Including a "top space to view" constraint means the buttons aren't anchored to the bottom.</p>  <p>Is there a way to include this "flexible space" using Auto layout alone? What can be done if not?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/qeXb2.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/qeXb2.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
