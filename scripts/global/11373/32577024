<p>I know we can change UIView layer's properties in IB with keyPath, but can we make the changes be reflected in IB?</p>  <p>For example, I change the cornerRadius of the following UIImageView. I can see the changes in after building the project, but not in the IB itself.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/E082a.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/E082a.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
