<p>I was having trouble assigning a custom class to a UIViewController in Interface Builder, despite it being the correct sub-class etc. </p>  <p>I came across the following answer to a similar question: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/31335628/909446">http://stackoverflow.com/a/31335628/909446</a> where the user suggested moving the project to the Desktop. I did this and I was now able to assign the custom class to the controller. </p>  <p>I have been able to assign custom classes before this and as far as I know I haven't changed any settings in Xcode. So what is the reason for this? This problem seems to appear in both Xcode 6 and the latest beta of Xcode 7.</p>
