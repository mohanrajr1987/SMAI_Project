<p>I am trying to make a GradientView that is adjustable in Interface Builder. I've been able to get it so I can specify vertical vs horizontal, as well as start/stop colors:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/IOVVa.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/IOVVa.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I would like to be able to be able to include intermediate colors as well. Is this possible with the hooks <code>@IBInspectable</code>/<code>@IBDesignable</code> provide?</p>  <p>I could envision a <code>+</code> button which would insert a row there and allow it to accommodate more colors.</p>  <p><em>(aside: I do wish I would have done this a long time ago, designers seem to throw lots of gradients at me, and I've always open coded them)</em></p>
