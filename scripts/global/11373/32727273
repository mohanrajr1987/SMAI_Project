<p>In the latest Xcode, some NSTextfields have started automatically visually compressing values that are too long to be displayed.  This is happening in xibs that have not been converted to autolayout.  I understand that if I convert the design to use autolayout, the "compression resistance" setting would control this, but I am hoping not to have to convert to autolayout at this time.  Is there some way to simply return to the old, default behavior? </p>
