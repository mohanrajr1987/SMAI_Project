<p>On a Watch app, all my <code>@IBOutlet</code> variables are nil during the <code>willActivate</code> in my main scene.</p>  <p>I have a page-based application, and the other scenes are working fine, but my main scene finds all <code>@IBOutlet</code> to be nil. The weirdest part is that it was working fine until at some point, I don't know why, everything started to be nil.</p>  <p>I tried setting them to either <code>weak</code> or not, but this didn't change anything. They are not custom elements, only <code>WKInterfaceLabel</code>, <code>WKIntefaceGroup</code> and things like that.</p>  <p>The declarations are like this:</p>  <pre><code>@IBOutlet weak var gamesTable: WKInterfaceTable! @IBOutlet weak var livesGroup: WKInterfaceGroup! @IBOutlet weak var livesLabel: WKInterfaceLabel! @IBOutlet weak var coinsLabel: WKInterfaceLabel! @IBOutlet weak var livesTimer: WKInterfaceTimer! </code></pre>  <p>They seem correctly linked in Xcode, and I tried cleaning/restarting Xcode:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/DJTs2.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/DJTs2.png" alt="Xcode outlet links screenshot"></a></p>
