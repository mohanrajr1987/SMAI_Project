<p>I have a tableView on my view, when the user taps on a certain cell I am showing a view that has a date picker on it, it partially covers the tableView.</p>  <p>The issue that i'm having is that the tableView is hijacking the touch for the button that closes the view containing the date picker. I have tried resizing the tableView to test this theory, it works perfectly then the tableView isn't underneath the button.</p>  <p>Does anyone know how I can prioritise the touches on the button over the tableView?</p>  <p>I have tried bringing the view to the front: <code>self.view.bringSubviewToFront(self.datePickerView)</code></p>  <p>And the views are in the correct order in the storyboard:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/CEYa6.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/CEYa6.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
