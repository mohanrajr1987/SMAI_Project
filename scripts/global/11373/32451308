<p>i am trying to include a custom font into my project but i just cannot appear to do that. I was able to do it in my pervious projects without a problem. </p>  <p>First of all, when i include a font in to xCode project it appears like this: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Djwfx.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Djwfx.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I have tried alots of things, and I know the guidelines when adding a new font,I have read a lot of articles like this (<a href="http://codewithchris.com/common-mistakes-with-adding-custom-fonts-to-your-ios-app/" rel="nofollow">Common Mistakes With Adding Custom Fonts to Your iOS App</a>) and done that several times with success, but now it just wont work.</p>  <p>Fonts are included in the project, they are in copy bundle resources and in the .plist file.</p>  <p>Also I have tried cleaning the project, deleting derivated data, I actually created the whole project from scratch, with no success... </p>  <p>xCode version is 6.4  Font in question is Roboto but i couldn't include any other.  Font type is .ttf but i have tried with .otf also.</p>  <p>Any help here?</p>
