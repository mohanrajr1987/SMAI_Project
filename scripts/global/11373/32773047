<p>I've been transitioning  my programmatically-created user interface over to interface builder, but I'm still fairly new to IB. I have a custom view inside of my main view (in the IB .xib file), which I want to link to its own view class, and, more importantly, its own view controller.</p>  <p>I know that traditionally, one references the custom view class from the IB property, and then uses -awakeFromNib in the custom view class to set up the view programatically.</p>  <p>However, I can't figure out how to reference the custom view <em>controller</em> class. How to I tell my custom view what it's controller should be? And is there a way to instantiate a view controller from IB, or should I be doing it from -awakeFromNib?</p>  <p>Advice would be appreciated :) Obj-C please!</p>
