<p>Trying to use IB to design a custom control which can then be re-used within my IB screens themselves I have come up against this issue.  Is there a better way to do this?  </p>  <p>Work around was from: <a href="http://blog.boxuanzhang.me/custom-reusable-uiview-with-xib/" rel="nofollow">http://blog.boxuanzhang.me/custom-reusable-uiview-with-xib/</a></p>  <p>My initial problem was described here: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32876386/swift-custom-control-is-not-showing-when-being-used-in-view-controller-code-att">Swift custom control is not showing when being used in view controller (code attached)</a></p>  <p>Work around for which I'm wondering if there is a better way is noted in code below: </p>  <pre><code>var view:UIView!     // override initializers override init(frame: CGRect) {     super.init(frame: frame)     xibSetup() }  required init?(coder aDecoder: NSCoder) {     super.init(coder: aDecoder)     xibSetup() }   // methods to load interface from nib  func xibSetup() {     if self.subview.count == 0 {        // *** WORK AROUND ***          view = loadViewFromNib()         view.frame = bounds          view.autoresizingMask = UIViewAutoresizing.FlexibleWidth | UIViewAutoresizing.FlexibleHeight          addSubview(view)     } }  func loadViewFromNib() -&gt; UIView {      let bundle = NSBundle(forClass: self.dynamicType)     let nib = UINib(nibName: nibName, bundle: bundle)     let view = nib.instantiateWithOwner(self, options: nil)[0] as! UIView      return view } </code></pre>
