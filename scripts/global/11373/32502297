<p>This seems like such a simple question, but I can't get it working for the life of me.</p>  <p>If I manually add a <code>UIBarButtonItem</code> to the <code>UINavigationItem</code> via Storyboard, and set its 'System Item' attribute to 'Edit', it does <em>not</em> seem to trigger <code>setEditing:animated:</code> when pressed.</p>  <p>However, if I add the right bar button item manually in code, like so:</p>  <pre><code>override func viewDidLoad() {     super.viewDidLoad()      navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem = editButtonItem() } </code></pre>  <p>then the button does correctly trigger that method.  Importantly, it also automatically changes to 'Done' for the duration of editing (which a manual call to <code>setEditing:animated:</code> from an <code>IBAction</code> won't do).</p>  <p>Is there a way to set up that automatic connection from storyboard?</p>
