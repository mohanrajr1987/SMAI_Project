<p>I created some retina-quality icons for my tab bar, because when I create them small enough to fit in the tab bar they look like crap on the iPhone 6+.  Anyway, that's fine, because I just use the image edge insets for each UITabBarItem in interface builder to get them the right size in the app.  When I do, my retina icons look great.  However, whenever you tap a button, the edge insets are just completely thrown out the window and the icon expands to its normal large size, never to return again.  Not to mention, if I keep clicking on an already selected tab bar item, the icon just starts to appear in weird stretched states.  I am not changing the insets in some viewDidLoad or anything like that.  What gives?</p>  <h2>Edit</h2>  <p>I'm reading that this may be a bug.  In that case - is there some way around this issue?</p>
