<p>I work with GIT, and after pull/pushing the project repository, I went to run the application to test I pushed a working version. However, after running the app, I am struck with this error immediately upon compile:</p>  <p>"The document "Setstory.storyboard" could not be opened. The operation couldnâ€™t be completed. (com.apple.InterfaceBuilder error -1.)" </p>  <p>I am running the latest version of XCode(7.0.0) and OSX 10.10.5.</p>  <p>I have tried googling this for an entire day, and still have not been able to figure it out. Has anybody else seen this? </p>
