<p>I want to explain cause the title could be not so clear. We have a jsp form with a submit button which call an action.  In this active we go to a service which executes some methods to do some calculus. One of this calculus (value above or under a threshold) must change/execute a javascript function. In other words, after the action calculus in need to be able to execute a javascript function in the same jsp page.</p>  <p><strong><em>What i've done without success :</em></strong></p>  <p>I create a hidden property in JSP and 2 conditionals for true or false states. False state is given by default (in the Form in Java) to the property and works fine. But when i change the value of the property in the form nothing change in JSP and the property still have a false value. We can't go to another page, we stay at the same jsp page.</p>  <p>JSP is not evaluating in real time the value of this property ?</p>  <p>Any other option to communicate between action and jsp ?</p>  <p><strong>JSP property</strong></p>  <pre><code>&lt;nested:hidden property="quitProgressBar"&gt;&lt;/nested:hidden&gt;             &lt;nested:equal value="true" property="quitProgressBar"&gt;                 &lt;script&gt;             alert('Prueba JVE');       &lt;/script&gt;             &lt;/nested:equal&gt;             &lt;nested:equal value="false" property="quitProgressBar"&gt;                 &lt;script&gt;         alert('Recien cargado');       &lt;/script&gt;             &lt;/nested:equal&gt; </code></pre>
