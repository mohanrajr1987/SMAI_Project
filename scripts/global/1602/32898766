<p>I am currently having an issue measuring the time an sql query takes in JAVA code. In the code below, <code>stmt.executeQuery(query.getQuery());</code> will do a SQL query and I am using <code>System.currentTimeMillis()</code> to see how long the query takes. The issues is that in the below jsp page where I view the results of <code>queryTime</code> , I am getting results such as <code>The query took 18:00:00:055 time.</code> for an extremely simple database (2 very small tables) and an extremely simple query. 18 hours obviously isn't a realistic time as the query runs on my computer in a matter of milliseconds. What am I doing wrong?</p>  <p>EDIT: In response to the submitted answers, I am outputting <code>queryDuration</code> to console along with the sql query that was submitted for testing and getting results such as (where the milliseconds are output after the SQL query that was entered):</p>  <pre><code>query (from controller): select * from service_request milliseconds: 1 query (from controller): select * from data_file where service_request_id =     '2' milliseconds: 0 path: www.foobar.com/custom/bin/lib/ path: www.foobar.com/images/resources/ query (from controller): select FN_Contact from service_request where Notes   IS NOT NULL milliseconds: 10 query (from controller): select FN_Contact from service_request where Notes IS NULL milliseconds: 0 query (from controller): select Notes, LN_Contact from service_request where   FN_Contact = 'Amanda' milliseconds: 0  </code></pre>  <p>how does this make sense when some of the queries that are seemingly more complicated are completed in less time? (these tables are very small, 4-5 columns in each and 4-5 entries in each)</p>  <p>java calculating query time:</p>  <pre><code>long queryStart = System.currentTimeMillis(); ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(query.getQuery()); long queryEnd = System.currentTimeMillis(); long queryDuration = queryEnd-queryStart; Date queryDurationTime = new Date(queryDuration); DateFormat formatter = new SimpleDateFormat("HH:mm:ss:SSS"); String dateFormatted = formatter.format(queryDurationTime); queryTime = dateFormatted; </code></pre>  <p>displaying queryTime on jsp page:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;c:choose&gt;     &lt;c:when test="${empty queryTime}"&gt;     &lt;/c:when&gt;     &lt;c:otherwise&gt;         &lt;h3&gt;Results:&lt;/h3&gt;         The query took ${queryTime} time.     &lt;/c:otherwise&gt; &lt;/c:choose&gt; </code></pre>
