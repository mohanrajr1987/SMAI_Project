<p>I have created one network using jung module. I want to incorporate into my JSP file. I have tried following commands</p>  <pre><code>&lt;%@page import="Sample.Basic.trail.*" %&gt;  &lt;%@page import="Sample.Basic.JDBC.*" %&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Here, <code>Sample.Basic</code> is my package name. <code>trail</code> is my class name. But when i run my jsp file, this network is not showing in the webpage. Can anyone please help me with this.</p>
