<p>I am new to netty. I have my application where i am using JSP/Servlet and Netty separately to download my reports. now i want to to use jsp as a client which interact with Netty which hit my application to generate the report and take it from my application and again pass it to jsp, where client can download that report. as netty is working on TCP and JSP/Servlet are working on HTTP, so i am little confuse that this is possible or not, and if possible then please provide some solution tip for this. thanks </p>
