<p>We have a Struts application that shows validation errors at the top after the form is submitted (we're using Struts 1.3 but this is a general question).</p>  <pre><code>  &lt;logic:messagesPresent message="false"&gt;         &lt;html:messages id="eachMsg" message="false"&gt;             &lt;logic:present name="eachMsg"&gt;                 &lt;!-- Add each error message --&gt;                 &lt;div class="errors"&gt;                     &lt;bean:write name="eachMsg" filter="false" /&gt;                 &lt;/div&gt;             &lt;/logic:present&gt;         &lt;/html:messages&gt;     &lt;/logic:messagesPresent&gt; </code></pre>  <p>The ResourceBundle looks as follows, with placeholders to be replaced by descriptive labels, e.g.,</p>  <pre><code>error.required={0} is required </code></pre>  <p>and from the code side, errors are added in the standard Struts manner,</p>  <pre><code>errors.add(key, new ActionMessage("error.required", new String[] { fieldLabel })); </code></pre>  <p>The resulting ActionErrors map looks as follows, e.g.,</p>  <pre><code>{AddressZipCode=[error.required[The ZIP Code]], ..} </code></pre>  <p>We now have to create hyperlinks from the error lines directly to each corresponding error field (e.g. "#fieldName"). In the above, "The ZIP Code" would be a scroll-link to the AddressZipCode field.</p>  <p>I see 2 ways of doing it:</p>  <ol> <li>Dynamically manipulate the ResourceBundle on the fly, by modifying each string with the <code>&lt;a href&gt;</code> and re-saving into the ResourceBundle. (I suppose we could change the original ResourceBundle Properties file to include URLs with #field refs but that doesn't sound right.) </li> <li>Somehow change our Error-Displaying JSP such that we don't just write the resource line, but get the individual tokens (field name, field label, and all other text) and concatenate them our own custom way to get the right error line with the URL.</li> </ol>  <p>Any suggestions?</p>
