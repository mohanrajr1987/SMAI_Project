<p>I'm trying to create the custom spring security page but when I submit I get the following error: "Expected CSRF token not found. Has your session expired?"</p>  <p>I know if we were using plan JSPs we could just add </p>  <pre><code>&lt;input type="hidden" th:name="${_csrf.parameterName}" th:value="${_csrf.token}" /&gt; </code></pre>  <p>or alternatively the tags/form tag to the JSP. I'm new to moustache and since we don't have access to the EL I can't see a workaround for this. I obviously do not want to disable CSRF protection </p>  <p>Thanks</p>
