<p>I try compiling single JSP file outside of the <code>WEB-INF/view</code> directory at the same level of <code>index.jsp</code> for testing purpose but I get this error code:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Error: Could not find or load main class org.netbeans.modules.web.project.ant.JspCSingle</p> </blockquote>  <p>It used to work fine, I could create single JSP files outside the WEB-INF but I have no clue what happened that keeps me from doing it now...</p>  <p>I use Netbeans 8.0.2 and Glassfish 4.1</p>
