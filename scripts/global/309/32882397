<p>What i need to do: I need to load a 3D model of an image into the viewcontroller. The image must rotate according to the users touch. Also if the user selects a part of the image, a function for that part must open.</p>  <p>I am assuming that i will have to load a 3d graphics kit. I have started looking into openGLES and Nineveh GL. </p>  <p>This is for a native app and not a game using sprite kit. How do i go about implementing this into my app? Could somebody also tell me what documentation i need to refer to? </p>
