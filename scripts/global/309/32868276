<p>I'm working on a little funny project, that draw a planet based on fractal generation. My project works under standard PyOpenGL call, but in order to make it more interactive, I wanted to export it on IPython Notebook.</p>  <p>I only work with some triangles, in cartesian coordinate system. Is there a way, as three.js purpose, to draw a really basic 3D scene based on some polygons in IPython notebooks ? I saw a lot of static plot library but nothing that looks like what I'm looking for.</p>  <p>PS: by interactive, I meen you can rotate the scene for example.</p>
