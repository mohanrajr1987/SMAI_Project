<p>I'm a physics student and my field of interest is fluid simulations. In the research group where I belong, the main method we use is the Lattice Bolztmann method for solving the Navier-Stokes equations. It is based in the discretization of space and time, dividing the space into a lattice. </p>  <p>One important thing in this model is the properties of the simulation space, I mean, whether at certain point there is an obstacle, a fan or other thing.</p>  <p>So far, we can define our simulation space in a traditional C++ array and "by hand" assigning properties to certain points (something like <code>L[ix][iy][iz] = fan;</code> and the simulation well take this into account while doing the calculations). This is really limited because we can use only simple shapes as obstacles or sources. I would like to implement some method to load complex arrays and see what happens in the fluid.</p>  <p>PD: I'm kind of asking for a way to convert a 3d model into a 3d C++ array where if there is an object you put a 1 and if there is no object a 0, something like that... </p>
