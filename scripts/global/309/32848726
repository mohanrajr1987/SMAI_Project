<p>I need to be able to interact with a <strong>representation</strong> of a cilinder that has many different parts in it. When the users taps over on of the small rectangles, I need to display a popover related to the specific piece (form).</p>  <p>The next image demonstrates a realistic 3d approach. But, I repeat, I need to solve the problem, the <strong>3d is NOT</strong> required (would be really cool though). A representation that complies the functional needs will suffice.</p>  <p>The info about the parts to make the drawing comes from an API (size, position, etc)</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/cjYK2.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/cjYK2.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I dont need it to be realistic really. The simplest aproximation would be to show a cilinder in a 2d representation, like a rectangle made out of interactable small rectangles.</p>  <p>So, as I mentioned, I think there are (as I see it) two opposite approaches: <strong>Realistic or Simplified</strong></p>  <p>Is there a way to achieve a nice solution in the middle? What libraries, components, frameworks that I should look into? </p>  <p>My research has led me to SceneKit, but I still dont know if I will be able to interact with it. <strong>Interaction is a very important part</strong> as I need to display a popover when the user taps on any small rectangle over the cylinder.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
