<p>I need some helping rendering in 3D some scans I did of a piece of tissue. One scan was from right to left and the second scan was from top to bottom. In a sense I have 1 set of slices that i call 0 degrees and a second set i call 90 degrees. I was hoping to combine these sets in imagej to create a more detailed rendering compared to using just 1 set.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>  <p>-Frozen</p>
