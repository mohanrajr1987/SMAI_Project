<p>I am working on a 3D scanner using a laser and camera and some other stuff needed,  the idea is that the camera captures an image to the target when the laser is on, then use the image to gain the laser line as <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> coordinates. <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/bg7Yd.png" rel="nofollow">Image</a> for explanation.</p>  <p>My question here is: how could i use these coordinates to generate the <code>Z</code> point in order to plot the 3D surface?</p>  <p>for better understanding link for an image. <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/YLhMu.png" rel="nofollow">Image</a></p>  <p>The target is on a circular disk "it is not shown in the image" with a known radius </p>
