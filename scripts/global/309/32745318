<p>This is a problem that I meet on Unity3D, but it's actually a request for help for a general graphical algorithm. I have a set of 3D objects/meshes that form a map. To generalize let's say that they are arrays of 6 numbers: position and size.</p>  <p>I need to create a box that contains all these objects. The box must have the minimum possible volume. To generalize, we can say that also the box will end to be an array of 9 numbers: position, size and rotation.</p>  <p>So at the end I'm talking about a function that takes a set of array[6] and returns an array[9].</p>  <p>The box can be obviously rotated in 3 directions as needed, so it's not just "take the smallest and the biggest x, y and z values".</p>  <p>Probably this question can some how easily resolved with a few trigonometrical functions, but i don't have any idea of how to do it! I only could create something that does that iteratively, but that's not what I want.</p>  <p>A particular case of this problem could be to find the minimum box containing a set of points. Probably this question is easier and some how can be extended to the main problem. Anyway... I can't solve neither this one! :)</p>  <p>Thanks for the help.</p>
