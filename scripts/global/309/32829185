<p>I have created a  surface graph in MATLAB which I have projected on to X-Y axis.  I want to find the equation of a line that follows the yellow region in the following graph. That is I want to find the equation of a curved line like the one displayed from the black curve.<br> Is there a way for me to draw a curved line on this surface graph and then obtain the equation of that curve.<br> If it is a line in MATLAB I think I can do it by <code>Insert-&gt; Line</code>.  Is there a similar way for me to draw a curve on the surface graph? </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/sCE8l.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/sCE8l.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
