<p>I found there is a way to easily do the lineplot in 2d by using <code>vtkXYPlotActor</code>. However, my data is 3d and I would like to plot the same lineplot, but in 3D. So far, I found a solution by adding each point of my data to <code>points</code> and <code>lines</code>, but dealing with axes, etc, is a pain in the neck. Is there already a nice solution for that? </p>  <p>p.s. <code>Mayavi</code> is not an option.</p>
