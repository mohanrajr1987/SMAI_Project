<p>Q.) I have canvas element and i'm drawing with 2D javascript(papaer js) and  3D javascript(babylon js) on canvas. Now, i want to add/draw image on that canvas in 2D and 3D. I can draw image on canvas using 2D JS(Paper js).</p>  <p>like this, </p>  <pre><code>var canvas = document.getElementById('canvsID'); var context = canvas.getContext('2d'); </code></pre>  <p>and i get the result with that. </p>  <p>i want to do same thing with 3D JS. But it wont, work with 3D JS. it is just because my 3D js is continuously rendering. </p>  <p>So, is there any way for that.</p>  <p>I read that you can use getContext() with 3D like this..</p>  <pre><code> var context = canvas.getContext('webgl'); </code></pre>  <p>But, still it wont work..! It says "WebGL not supported"</p>
