<p>What is the best way to create 3D graphic images for websites? I want to create different 3D characters for my website from which user can select one. On moving the mouse, the user should be able to view the character in 3 dimensions. From the little I know, I understand it is not possible using HTML5 Canvas. Is there any option to do this?</p>
