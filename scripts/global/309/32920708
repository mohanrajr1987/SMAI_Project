<p>I have a 3D spatial envelope (or 3D shape), which I can describe by an indicator function theta(<strong>r</strong>), that is one inside of the envelope and zero outside. </p>  <p>I am trying to find an efficient way to compute the distance distribution <strong>within</strong> this general three-dimensional shape. In other words: what is the probabiliy that the point R+deltaR is inside the envelope given that R is inside? You could write this as an integral</p>  <p>P(<strong>deltaR</strong>) = \int d<strong>R</strong> theta(<strong>R</strong>) theta(<strong>R</strong>+<strong>deltaR</strong>)</p>  <p>This seems like a very generic problem, but I don't find the right keywords to search for the solution.</p>  <p>Many thanks!</p>
