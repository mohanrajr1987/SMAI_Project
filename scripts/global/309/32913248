<p>I'm trying to create a 3D game in Java, but I've got the following problem: I can't create 3D objects from 2D images, because I don't know how to scale them. I thought you have to have 4 points (8 integers) to scale the image, like you set the point of the top left corner, the top right, the bottom right and the bottom left. Does anyone know how to do this? And no, I don't realy like using other peoples libraries like LWJGL or something else :P. By the way, I'm dutch so sorry for (maybe) grammar mistakes.</p>
