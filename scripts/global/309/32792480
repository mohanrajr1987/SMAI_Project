<p>I used the jsc3d viewer to import a group parts of a 3d object in .obj format with texture defined. And i would like to be able to assign new textures to each separate part.  For example, i have my .obj file loaded, with 10 differents parts. All the parts are completely white. I have 3 textures in .png format (red, blue and green). i want to assign the texture "red" to some parts, the textures "blue" and "green" to the others. And i want to be able to modify them. How to do that?</p>  <p>Thanks for your help</p>
