<p>I'm currently using a Microsoft Kinect for Windows in a project. I use the Kinect for 3D scanning an object and then I want to reconstruct it to get a .stl file which can be 3D printed. I tried using Kinect Fusion (Kinect Fusion Explorer-WPF which is in C#) to do this, but I noticed that the reconstruction is taking too long, and I have to rotate the Kinect very slowly around the object to get a good 3D reconstruction. Also, the program loses track of the reconstruction after capturing about 30 frames, so I'm not able to get a full 360 degree view of the object. Is there any other software or library I can use to solve this problem?</p>
