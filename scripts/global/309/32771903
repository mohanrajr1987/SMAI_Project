<p>Is there a Matlab helper function that unrectifies pixels? I'm trying to project 3D points from a point cloud into raw 2D image pixels. While going from 3D to rectified 2D pixel coordinates is relatively simple, going from these rectified coordinates to raw image coordinates is much more difficult (see: <a href="http://docs.ros.org/diamondback/api/image_geometry/html/c++/pinhole__camera__model_8cpp_source.html#l00330" rel="nofollow">http://docs.ros.org/diamondback/api/image_geometry/html/c++/pinhole__camera__model_8cpp_source.html#l00330</a>).</p>
