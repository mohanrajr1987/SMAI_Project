<p>So i'm making a one page scroll-down website and i've found this demo example of a template : <a href="http://volar.makwan.net/index02.html" rel="nofollow">http://volar.makwan.net/index02.html</a></p>  <p>I really liked the animation on the top of the page that follows your mouse and i would like to put it in my website. Unfortunately i have no clue how to do it and what part of the code is responsible for it.</p>  <p>Can you help me pls?</p>
