<p>I want to draw graphs that are embedded on 3D square grid of points (so basically I connect various grid points to form edges). I've tried perspective drawing but I'm horrible at it, so I'm wondering what kind of software might allow me to (easily) do this? Mostly as a visualisation tool. I know Blender is used for 3D modelling but I was wondering if there are simpler solutions that don't require as much learning overhead?</p>
