<p>we have a ZMap (aka depth-map) picture obtained from 3D triangulation with laser and camera. We know the depth value of each pixel and the resolution of camera (each pixel is associated to a 3d coordinate in mm). Our goal is to visualize the Zmap as a 2d Surface, so we thought of creating a point cloud, generate a mesh and display it with some 3D library We thought vtk could be the right choice, but we encountered some problem.</p>  <p>First we tried unorganized structure (vtkPolyData), generating meshes by 3dDalaunay triangulation. But the code is properly working when number of points is &lt; 50k. Our 3D reconstruction is composed by 480k points and the computation time is really too much high.</p>  <p>Then we switched to organized (point with connections). IMHO this additional information should reduce computation time to create mesh, but we are not able to understand how to create a "vtkStructuredGrid" and to feed it with our Z values to get a 2D meshed surface.</p>  <p>Is it the proper way to do? Has anyone never tried this?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
