<p>I am looking to build a voice based interactive automation system. To make the experience more realistic I am looking for 3D avatars that could read a given text(response) in real time.</p>  <p>The closest I found something on the net is Ultra HAL for windows (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEtgfXbpCqI" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEtgfXbpCqI</a>). I need something similar, expressive, programmable through an API and preferable for a MAC or Linux. TTS is not that mandatory.</p>  <p>Thanks for the help.</p>
