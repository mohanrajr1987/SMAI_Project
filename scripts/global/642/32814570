<p>I have an SSL client certificate. It was working with my app up until one of the Java updates happened at some point in the recent past (maybe as far back as a year). It works with web browsers. It works with curl.</p>  <p>For example, I can do this and it is fine:</p>  <p><code>curl --cert example.pem https://example.net</code></p>  <p>Now I cannot get this cert to work with Java. I've gone as far as trying a very minimal app, like SSLPoke from <a href="https://gist.github.com/4ndrej/4547029" rel="nofollow">https://gist.github.com/4ndrej/4547029</a></p>  <p>Putting the cert into the client certs from ControlPanel doesn't do it.</p>  <p>Importing the .pem into a keystore and then pointing at that keystore with <code>-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore</code> or <code>.keystore</code> doesn't do it.</p>  <p>All I get out of Java is: </p>  <p><code>javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Received fatal alert: handshake_failure</code></p>  <p>So I can't figure out what is wrong - the way I'm invoking Java? The place I'm putting the certificate? The way I've imported the certificate?</p>  <p>The debug output using <code>-Djava.security.debug=all</code> does not show it using the trustStore/keyStore I specify. It doesn't even show anything about the URL I'm trying to reach.</p>  <p>I'm out of ideas.</p>
