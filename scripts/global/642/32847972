<p>This is a bit unorthodox of an approach, but I need to post query values into a form handler. What I'm doing  is taking a query from a separate database and I need to post those query values into the action page that processes form values to submit to a different database table. </p>  <p>In this case, I don't have a form; I just need to post the values of the query into the form action page which will post those values and additional generated values to a dozen different tables. The reason I'm trying to do it this way because the form handler page that processes the form values has over 2,700 lines of code that takes those values and operates on them, running numerous <code>IF ELSE</code> operations to decide which table those values should go in based on other values; so simply querying the tables and directly inserting them is not an option. </p>  <p>How can I get the query values into form handler page without using a form?</p>
