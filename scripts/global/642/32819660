<p>I'm developing an Android app with PhoneGap Build and I experienced an annoying problem: </p>  <p>I make ajax GET calls to our HTTPS server, and it works without any problems if I just package a debug version of the app.</p>  <p>As soon as I sign the application with my key, and try out the app on my phone or an emulator, it fails with the following error: </p>  <pre><code>NetworkError: A Network error occured. </code></pre>  <p>If I change all the https addresses, to http, package it and sign it the same way, it suddenly starts working again.</p>  <p>To sum up:</p>  <p>UNSIGNED apk : - https &amp; http both work</p>  <p>SIGNED apk : only http works.</p>  <p>I want to clarify, that the android permissions are unchanged, only the http<strong>s</strong> is the difference.</p>
