<p>Let's say I send someone by email a link to a section of my web which requires the user to be logged in. For ex:</p>  <pre><code>https://www.web.com/serverroute/angularapp#/clientrouteone </code></pre>  <p>When the user that has not logged in clicks on the link, the client site only knows about "web.com/serverroute/" and redirects to login form.</p>  <p>Now on successful login how to go around it if I want redirecting to the original full url requested?</p>
