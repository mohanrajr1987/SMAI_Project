<p>I use HttpURLConnection to browse to a HTTPS image link. I try to compare the total bytes i read from input stream VS the size of the total Application Data size in the TLS packet (capture with Wireshark). Apparently the size i read from input stream are bigger than the total size of the Application Data in the TLS packet. So, i was wondering whether data was compressed in the TLS packet. I've tried to do some read up but still not quite sure.</p>
