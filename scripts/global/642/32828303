<p>Trying out PAW and liking it very much. The only thing I don't manage to get working is using HTTPS mutual auth. Some of the APIs I need to interact with require mutually authenticated https.</p>  <p>How do I tell PAW to use a cert to authenticate? The cert is already in OSX Keychain and Safari can do GETs to that API without problems, so I (hope) it should be doable...</p>  <p>Not being able to do this might be the make/or break for PAW for me.</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
