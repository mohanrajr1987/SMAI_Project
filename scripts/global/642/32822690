<p>I'm writing a packed app for Firefox OS. I want to communicate with an external server via https. If I execute the app as normal website it is running but in Firefox OS or the simulator I receive </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at <a href="https://mozilla.goip.de/Webradio%20V2/php/download_streams.php" rel="nofollow">https://mozilla.goip.de/Webradio%20V2/php/download_streams.php</a>. This can be fixed by moving the resource to the same domain or enabling CORS.</p> </blockquote>  <p>without <code>"systemXHR" : {}</code> and <code>"type": "privileged"</code> in the manifest and <code>{ mozSystem: true }</code> in <code>req = new XMLHttpRequest({ mozSystem: true });</code>. Using this my server still only receives an request only using http. With https the server receives no request and the status of the request is 0. The server already allows access by <code>header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *');</code> (PHP).</p>  <p>Is there any way to use https for the connection?</p>
