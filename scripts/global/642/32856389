<p>My http server is based on BaseHTTPServer with Python 2.7.6. Now I want it to support ssl transportation, so called https.</p>  <p>I have installed pyOpenSSL and recompiled python source code with ssl support. And it does work when I try <code>import ssl</code> in my python interpreter, but it doesn't work when I run the code on my server. The error log is like this:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>import _ssl # if we can't import it, let the error propagate</p> </blockquote>  <p>It looks quite strange, doesn't it? My operating system is Debian Linux distribution. I have tried all kinds of ways which I can find on the Internet for days, anyone can help me get out of this trouble?</p>  <hr>  <p>I tried to "import _ssl" in server code directly, but it reminds me this: </p>  <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;callstack Traceback (most recent call last):   File "./script/main.py", line 85, in process     net_flag = net_api_process()   File "./script/core/netbase/interface.py", line 96, in net_api_process     flag1 = network.instance().process()   File "./script/core/netbase/network.py", line 271, in process     if network.process(max_events):   File "./script/core/netbase/network.py", line 75, in on_incomin_stream     self.on_package(buf)   File "./script/core/netbase/network.py", line 78, in on_package     self.f_on_package(self, buf)   File "./script/client/behavior.py", line 68, in on_package     handler.OnPackage(pack, cmd, conn.m_uid, conn)   File "./script/client/handler.py", line 288, in OnPackage     func(uid, conn, pack)   File "./script/logic/user_info/modify.py", line 365, in OnModBaseInfo     ModBaseInfo(uid, conn, seq, json_str)   File "./script/logic/user_info/modify.py", line 385, in ModBaseInfo     modify_pub.Start()   File "./script/logic/user_info/modify.py", line 253, in Start     import _ssl ImportError: No module named _ssl </code></pre>
