<p>I have a <a href="https://www.xplorocity.ca" rel="nofollow">website</a> that loads fine in a browser, but when i put it in GTMetrix or Google page speed they both timeout. GTMetrix says one problem could be with my SSL certificate, but both Chrome and Firefox say it is a secure connection. </p>  <p>Not sure what to do? </p>
