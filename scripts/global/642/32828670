<p>I am trying to implement mutual authentication for the communication between aws api gateway and my server.  I want to use the client side certificates that amazon offers for authentication.  I know that my server is configured correctly because previously I was using a lambda function and mutual authentication was working. </p>  <p>I have exported the (.PEM) certificate and added it into a truststore.  I have configured my Jetty server to use that truststore for authentication.  I have set client-auth to :need.  I know my server is set up correctly because it was working with with my self-implemented mutual SSL.  All I did was change the truststore.  When I test my method gateway returns a 200:  { "message": "Unknown endpoint error."}</p>  <p>Here is an excerpt from the server log files.  It appears that the server side handshake completes, but there is an error with the client certificate.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>pConnection@3a0a2e84{FILLING} server-side handshake completed   2015-09-28 13:04:29,856 DEBUG [qtp1980278840-19]   o.e.j.i.ChannelEndPoint - flushed 45   SelectChannelEndPoint@2c05eeb2{ec2-xx-xxx-xxx-x.compute-1.amazonaws.com/5x.xxx.xxx.x:43942&lt;->4000,Open,in,out,-,-,0/200000,SslConnection}{io=0,kio=0,kro=1}   2015-09-28 13:04:29,856 DEBUG [qtp1980278840-19]   o.e.j.i.s.SslConnection -   SslConnection@50e2de43{NOT_HANDSHAKING,eio=0/0,di=-1} ->   HttpConnection@3a0a2e84{FILLING} flush exit, consumed 0 2015-09-28   13:04:29,856 DEBUG [qtp1980278840-19] o.e.j.i.s.SslConnection -   SslConnection@50e2de43{NOT_HANDSHAKING,eio=0/-1,di=-1} ->   HttpConnection@3a0a2e84{FILLING} unwrap Status = BUFFER_UNDERFLOW   HandshakeStatus = NOT_HANDSHAKING</p> </blockquote>
