<p>I'm upgrading an app to Swift 2 (Xcode 7). </p>  <p>When I'm loading a URL in a Webview a strange problem occurs: some HTTPS URLs won't load. Other URLs (also HTTPS) are working fine. </p>  <p>I already tried setting the NSAppTransportSecurity - NSAllowsArbitraryLoads to YES, but this doesn't fix the problem. Does anybody have any idea what may cause this issue? </p>  <p>Also tried to log via</p>  <pre><code>setenv("CFNETWORK_DIAGNOSTICS", "3", 1); </code></pre>  <p>but actually I don't know what to search for in the log file in order to track down the cause of this problem.</p>
