<p>I am trying Https webservice call from android client with SocketFactory unfortunately Android client always looks for SSL3 protocol on server certificate,my server is using Trust certificate issued from CA with TLS v1.0,v1.1,v1.2 is enabled. It always throws exception </p>  <blockquote>   <p>"javax.net.ssl.SSLException: SSL handshake aborted: ssl=0x6684af68:   I/O error during system call, Connection reset by peer".</p> </blockquote>  <p>If I try on device browser, it works. It always looks for TLS v1.2 protocol, but from android app which always looks for SSL 3.</p>  <p>please help me on this.</p>  <p>I have tried forcing to use protocol by </p>  <pre><code>SSLEngine engine = context.createSSLEngine(); engine.setEnabledProtocols(new String[]{"TLSv1"}); </code></pre>  <p>also tried with some library <code>http://www.jordanrejaud.com/android/2015/09/19/android-tls-ssl-engine.html</code> but throws runtime exceptions.</p>  <p>Testing on Android version 4.4.2.</p>  <p>Thanks in Advance.
