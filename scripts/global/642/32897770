<p>I set up Apache2 to host multiple websites on the same server following these instructions:  <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-apache-virtual-hosts-on-ubuntu-14-04-lts" rel="nofollow">https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-apache-virtual-hosts-on-ubuntu-14-04-lts</a></p>  <p>It works great, except that https doesn't work. Instead https just sends users to the <code>/var/www/html</code> folder of the server machine rather than the folder to which they should be redirected. How can I modify the Apache2 config to account for https?</p>
