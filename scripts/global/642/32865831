<p>How to get authorization through the Skype Web SDK (UCWA) on the basis of official examples?</p>  <p>I have a purchased account to use Skype for Business and entrance to the admin panel of Office 365. There were examples Download the official Skype Web SDK and <a href="https://ucwa.skype.com/code" rel="nofollow">UCWA</a> samples, which are deployed on the local machine (Apache server with directory localhost). I used to enter the account art@shockw4ves.onmicrosoft.com that I created when buying Skype for Business. As a result, I get a response in the form of pop-up messages <code>Service does not allow a cross domain request from this origin</code></p>  <p>At the request header to <code>https://lyncdiscover.shockw4ves.onmicrosoft.com/xframe</code> is an attribute <code>X-Ms-Origin: http://localhost</code>, can this problem? Long enough debugging process led me to the idea to connect the frame by hand and communicate with him through the post message, is this possible?</p>
