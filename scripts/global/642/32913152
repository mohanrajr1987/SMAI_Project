<p>I have tried googling before posting it here so i am not sure if i am using the right words to search or the answer isn't there (thats impossible)</p>  <p>Anyways, before i start, this is first time I am touching python, so please be gentle. </p>  <p>I am trying to learn python and the best way to do it is by working on my own project. The project i chose, is to automate some internal websites. These websites use cookies, authentication, sessions and chained calls (302). </p>  <p>I wrote this code</p>  <pre><code>import urllib, urllib2, cookielib  cj = cookielib.CookieJar() my_url = 'https://test.company.com/' opener = urllib2.build_response (urllib2.HTTPCookieProcessor(cj)) resp = opener.open(my_url)  print resp.read() </code></pre>  <p>Now its doing what it is suppose to do but since i am learning there are few things that i need to get conrol of</p>  <ol> <li>I don't want to do the chain redirects if its 302. I want to do it manually</li> <li>I want to extract the sessions so that with every request which i will be doing (with 302 location header), I can add that session/cookie</li> <li>any tutorial which helps me understand python and http will be appreciated. I am already taking course at codecademy.com</li> </ol>
