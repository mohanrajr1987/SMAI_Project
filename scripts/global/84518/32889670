<p>Apart from the obvious type system, I have read that there are features in TypeScript that are not available in ES6. The article did not mention what these features were or why they should be avoided.</p>  <p>I am already aware that TypeScript implements ES7 async/await syntax and this post (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22260978/which-es6-features-are-implemented-in-typescript">Which ES6 Features are Implemented in Typescript</a>) gives us the inverse relationship.</p>
