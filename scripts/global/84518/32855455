<p>I am currently building an angularJS/typescript web app with a Netbeans RESTful backend. I have my typescript interface set up for a vendor as follows:</p>  <pre><code>interface Vendor {     vendorno: number,     name: string,     address1: string,     city: string,     province: string,     postalcode: string,     phone: string,     vendortype: string,     email: string; } </code></pre>  <p>When I call my rest service to pull back all of the vendors from my JavaDB it is pulling back JSON named under a completely different scheme than my interface, and in order to get my angular directives to work, I have to reference the naming scheme of this JSON instead and it causing things to break:</p>  <pre><code>[{"vendorAddress":"543 Sycamore Ave","vendorCity":"Toronto","vendorEmail":"bb@depot.ca","vendorName":"Big Bills Depot","vendorNo":1,"vendorPhone":"(999) 555-5555","vendorPostalcode":"N1P1N5","vendorProvince":"ON","vendorType":"Trusted"}, {"vendorAddress":"628 Richmond Street","vendorCity":"London","vendorEmail":"abc@supply.ca","vendorName":"ABC Supply Co.","vendorNo":2,"vendorPhone":"(519) 123-4567","vendorPostalcode":"N6C1L7","vendorProvince":"ON","vendorType":"Trusted"}, {"vendorAddress":"123 Main Boulevard","vendorCity":"Burlington","vendorEmail":"gs@shack.net","vendorName":"Gadget Shack","vendorNo":3,"vendorPhone":"(613) 444-3423","vendorPostalcode":"N3X5S2","vendorProvince":"ON","vendorType":"Unknown"}] </code></pre>  <p>In order to display this vendor data in a table on my partial I would have to use the following angular bindings:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div class="col-lg-1 col-sm-1 col-xs-1 text-left"&gt;{{vend.vendorNo}}&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="col-lg-4 col-sm-4 col-xs-4 text-center"&gt;{{vend.vendorName}}&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="col-lg-3 col-sm-3 col-xs-3 text-center"&gt;{{vend.vendorCity}}&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="col-lg-3 col-sm-3 col-xs-3 text-center"&gt;{{vend.vendorType}}&lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Is there any reason for either angularJS or my Java REST service to be auto renaming my returned JSON to have these property names?</p>
