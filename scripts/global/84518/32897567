<p>I'm new to TypeScript and I'm facing a problem while trying to load lodash.</p>  <p>Here is my code :</p>  <pre><code>///&lt;reference path="../../typings/lodash/lodash.d.ts"/&gt;     ///&lt;reference path="../interfaces/IScheduler.ts"/&gt;  import _ = require('lodash');  module MyModule {    export class LeastUsedScheduler implements IScheduler {      /// CODE HERE   } } </code></pre>  <p>I tried replacing the import line by :</p>  <pre><code>import * as _ from lodash; </code></pre>  <p>In the two cases I get : </p>  <pre><code>"error| Cannot find name 'IScheduler'." </code></pre>  <p>When I remove the import directive it compiles perfectly but _ is undefined at runtime.</p>  <p>I also tried to put the import inside the module without success.</p>  <p>I'm sorry It must be a very dumb question but I can't figure it out.</p>  <p>Thank you</p>  <p><strong>EDIT :</strong></p>  <p>I understood the problem. Referencing the typing for lodash created the variable <code>_</code> in the scope. That's why it compiles fine without the import line. The problem is referencing the typing does not really import lodash. That's why it fails at runtime. </p>  <p>When I import lodash the compilation fails because lodash is already in the scope.</p>  <p>Thank you for your support.</p>
