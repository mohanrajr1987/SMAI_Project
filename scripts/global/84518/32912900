<p>I want to contribute to <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/TouchDevelop" rel="nofollow">TouchDevelop</a>, a TypeScript app that is compiled and run using jake. On my Windows machine, when I run <code>jake local</code> to run TouchDevelop (from Git Bash), the command line output looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>$ jake local [B] build/addCssPrefixes.js [B] build/jsonapi.js [B] build/officemix.js [B] build/ace-main.js [B] build/blockly-main.js [B] build/browser.js [B] build/genmeta.js [B] build/shell.js [B] build/client.js [B] build/rt.js [P] modifying in-place all css files *** START CSS *** END CSS [B] build/package.js [P] generating build/pkgshell.js and packaging create library cache file; 167546 bytes *** pkgshell.js written [P] generating build/api.js, localization.json and topiclist.json *** Start *** Stop; 366 files npm pack: touchdevelop-0.39.0.tgz [B] build/ast.js [B] build/libnode.js [B] build/storage.js [B] build/libwab.js [B] build/libcordova.js [B] build/runner.js [C] build/noderuntime.js [C] build/runtime.js [B] build/nrunner.js [B] build/embedded.js [B] build/editor.js [C] build/noderunner.js [C] build/main.js [I] build completed. cp -r build/shell.js build/local/tdserver.js starting shell watch... starting shell watch... starting shell watch... starting shell watch... starting shell watch... starting shell watch... starting shell watch... starting shell watch... starting shell watch... starting shell watch... </code></pre>  <p>After this, the line <code>starting shell watch...</code> is repeated every second or so indefinitely. Unfortunately, the TouchDevelop site never starts running, and as you can see, the line that normally shows which link would let me open the site isn't output either.</p>  <p>What could be causing this problem? Did I do something to misconfigure my machine?</p>
