<p>I've got a browserify javascript project, where I include modules with the <code>require</code> statement. I'm now adding in some typescript, and it's working fine when I simply <code>require</code> the compiled javascript. </p>  <p>But typescript also has its own <code>module</code> statement. How does this relate to browserify/node's modules? Should I be using both? That seems redundant. Which type of modules should be used, and under what circumstances? Thanks.</p>
