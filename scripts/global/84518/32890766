<p>I have a function declaration in an <code>Interface</code> like this:</p>  <pre><code>mixin(desc: MixinDescriptor): any; </code></pre>  <p>The <code>MixinDescriptor</code> is defined like this:</p>  <pre><code>interface MixinDescriptor { [id: string]: () =&gt; any; } </code></pre>  <p>However, if I use the <code>mixin</code> function like this:</p>  <pre><code>chance.mixin({   test: function(arg1, arg2) {   } } </code></pre>  <p>VSCode will indicate that it's not the right definition. It works, because its implementation works like that, but its interface declaration has to be wrong.</p>  <p>I've tried changing the <code>MixinDescriptor</code> to this:</p>  <pre><code>interface MixinDescriptor { [id: string]: (args: any[]) =&gt; any; } </code></pre>  <p>But that didn't work either.</p>  <p>How might I change that so it properly identifies the functions as able to accept named parameters, any number of them?</p>
