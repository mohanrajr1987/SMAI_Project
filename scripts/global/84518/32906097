<p>In c#, you can do #if DEBUG... to do something special when debugging. I would like to do a similar thing in Typescript so that I can set form values when testing. </p>  <p>Anyone have any suggestions on how to implement this in Typescript?</p>  <p>The best I have come up with is a settings class:</p>  <pre><code>export class Settings {     static isDebugging = false; }; </code></pre>  <p>Then when starting the app, I set it to true.</p>  <p>Then in code, I import the class and check to see if it is true or not.</p>  <pre><code>if (Settings.isDebugging)... </code></pre>  <p>Seems to work ok. </p>
