<p>I'm having problem with <code>systemJS</code> loading external modules.  I created a small sample project for VS2015.  You can download the code here <a href="https://github.com/dbiele/TypeScript-Cordova-SystemJS" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/dbiele/TypeScript-Cordova-SystemJS</a></p>  <p>When I build the project and view in Ripple or BrowserSync I get the following error: <code>xhr_proxy</code>.  It looks like <code>System</code> is looking for the external file <code>animate.js</code> on registry.jspm.io when it should be finding it on the <code>localhost</code>.  </p>  <p>Any thoughts? The code in GitHub is really basic. Note: I don't think this is a Cordova issue because I'm running in a browser and ripple.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/9MOVP.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/9MOVP.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
