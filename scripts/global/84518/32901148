<p>I'm using jspm and have installed a package. I have checked that the package.json defines 'main' and 'typings' since i have installed typescript 1.6 i expected to be able to import the typings at design time and the javascript at runtime per <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Typings-for-npm-packages" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Typings-for-npm-packages</a></p>  <p>what is strange is this does not work. I get cannot find the module 'theModule'</p>  <pre><code>import {x,y,z} from 'theModule'; </code></pre>  <p>but if i do a relative path it works fine</p>  <pre><code>import {x,y,z} from '../jspm_packages/github/blah/blah/dist/theModule'; </code></pre>  <p>I have tried everything i can think of but i just cant seem to get this to work. Any idea what I might be doing wrong?</p>
