<p>There is an API (<code>d3.map</code> to be specific), which implements a method <code>size</code>. However I would like to extend it so that it remains backwards compatible, but it can also be used as a value accessor/getter (because that is how it's specified in <code>ES6</code> now):</p>  <pre><code>var map = d3.map(); map.set(0, 1); console.log(map.size()); // Old code, should still work xhr.send(JSON.stringify(map.size)); // Should also work (as a getter) </code></pre>  <p>Is this possible?</p>
