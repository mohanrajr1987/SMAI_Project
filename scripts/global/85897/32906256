<p>I have the following entities defined in a legacy system where I cannot touch the database.</p>  <p>There are two tables: 1. CAR, with PK defined as Scenario and LicencePlate 2. CAR_EVENT with PK defined as LicencePlate and EventType</p>  <p>I am trying to populate the Events collection in Car with all records from CarEvent which has the same licence plate. </p>  <p>I have tried both declarative syntax and fluent, and I end up with errors like "VIEW OR TABLE NOT FOUND", since EF expects there to be a CarEventCar table", "Unable to determine the principal end of an association between the types" etc.</p>  <p>What is the correct way of setting up an association like this, in fluent or declarative syntax?</p>  <pre><code>public class Car {     [Key]     public string Scenario {get;set;}     [Key]     public string LicencePlate {get;set;}       public virtual ICollection&lt;CarEvent&gt; Events {get;set;}  }  public class CarEvent {     [Key]     public string LicencePlate {get;set;}     [Key]     public string EventType {get;set;} } </code></pre>
