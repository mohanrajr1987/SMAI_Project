<p>i tried to use the DatePart function of entity framework (version 6.1.3) with this code :</p>  <pre><code> from action in context.ActionEntetes  where action.Id_User == Id_User   select System.Data.Objects.SqlClient.SqlFunctions.DatePart("week", action.Date_Action) </code></pre>  <p>I have the following error : </p>  <pre><code>LINQ to Entities does not recognize the method 'System.Nullable`1[System.Int32] DatePart(System.String, System.Nullable`1[System.DateTime])' method, and this method cannot be translated into a store expression. </code></pre>  <p>I searched on the web and found that the namespace of the SqlFunction class could not be correct and should be System.Data.Entity.SqlServer but there is no SqlServer class in the System.Data.Entity namespace in my project...</p>  <p>I found that reinstalling EF by nuget would solve the problem but it didn't help. I also have a reference to EntityFramework.SqlServer in my project but it doesn't help either.</p>  <p>What namespace should I use for SqlFunctions? How can I get it available in my project?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
