<p>In my Project MVC Razor C# Entity Framework Code First. There are 3 languages. I am using resource file to fetch the value. This is working perfectly. </p>  <p>Now, I have another requirement to do the management of language Key's value. So in this way there will be a screen where Admin can do the changes by selecting the language from Dropdown and then selecting the key from dropdown. Then there will be an option to update the value for the selected Key.</p>  <p>Question: Should I continue using resource file for this requirement ? </p>  <p>or Kindly suggest</p>
