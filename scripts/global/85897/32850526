<p>I am using entity framework power tools beta 4 to create my POCO entities, but I want that power tools does not modify the names of the tables and columns that is set on my data base.</p>  <p>In the Context.tt I have this code:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;#     foreach (var set in efHost.EntityContainer.BaseEntitySets.OfType&lt;EntitySet&gt;())     { #&gt;         public DbSet&lt;&lt;#= set.Name #&gt;&gt; &lt;#= set.Name #&gt; { get; set; } &lt;#     } #&gt; </code></pre>  <p>The problem is that set.Name in some cases respect the name of the tablem when the table name ends with "s" but in otheres cases pluralize the name.</p>  <p>I would like to know where I have to modify the code to avoid that the TT modify the name of the tables and columns.</p>  <p>Thank you so much.</p>
