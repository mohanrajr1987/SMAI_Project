<p>I have a model class named <code>Foo</code> that has, among others, these properties.</p>  <pre><code>public string StripeRecipientId { get; set; }  public override bool HasProvidedBillingInformation {     get     {         // return !string.IsNullOrEmpty(this.StripeRecipientId);          return false;     } } </code></pre>  <p>I have enabled migrations and am using Code First. When I run the <code>update-database</code> commandlet, whether with <code>-Force</code> option is specified or not, I get this error:</p>  <p><code>Column names in each table must be unique.  Column name 'StripeRecipientId' in table  'dbo.Foos' is specified more than once.</code></p>  <p>I double-checked and triple checked and there's only one column of that name in my model as well as in the table. This column was created already by a previous run of the <code>update-database</code> commandlet just a while ago.</p>  <p>I am tempted to delete my database and then apply the migrations, but that will mean me having to create a lot of test data just to be able to test the feature I am working on just now.</p>  <p>I am using Entity Framework v6.1.2.</p>  <p>How do I get rid of this error?</p>
