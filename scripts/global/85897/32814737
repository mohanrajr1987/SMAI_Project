<p>C# Winforms, SQL Server, Entity Framework 6.</p>  <p>So I have two tables, <code>Employee</code> and <code>BusinessGroup</code>.  <code>Employee</code> is a foreign key in <code>BusinessGroup</code>.</p>  <p>As part of my testing, I'm trying to delete two employees and then calling <code>SaveChanges()</code>.</p>  <p>Naturally, it throws a <code>DbUpdateException</code> which I catch and am attempting to handle.</p>  <p><strong>Here's my issue:</strong>  The exception seems to get thrown as soon as the first delete (attempt) takes place.  What I'd like to do for my users is list ALL the records that cause a conflict (two in this case).</p>  <p>How can I do this?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
