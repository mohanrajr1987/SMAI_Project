<p>I have an instance of class loaded by db.MyclassSet.AsNoTracking(). So the entity is not tracked on the context. I need to know if the OneToMany property of MyClass is loaded. </p>  <p>If I try to access by reflections I get an exception:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>When an object is returned with a NoTracking merge option, Load can only be called when the EntityCollection or EntityReference does not contain objects.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Any idea?</p>
