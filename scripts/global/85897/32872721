<p><strong>Background</strong></p>  <p>We work in a geographically distributed team.  Every so often, a team on the other side of the world creates a build for the integration server that fails due to</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Unable to update database to match the current model because there are pending changes and automatic migration is disabled. Either write the pending model changes to a code-based migration or enable automatic migration. Set DbMigrationsConfiguration.AutomaticMigrationsEnabled to true to enable automatic migration.</p> </blockquote>  <p>We use code based migrations.</p>  <p>To simplify trouble shooting, I'm looking for a method to display what automatic automatic migration would have been applied, were automatic migrations allowed, from code.  The environment to script new migrations does not exist on the integration server, where the problem manifests.</p>  <p><strong>Attempted Solution</strong></p>  <p>I attempted to use DbMigrator <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/17940439/141172">as outlined here</a>, but that seems to only display code based migrations that have not yet been applied.</p>  <p><strong>Question</strong></p>  <p>Is there a code-based method that will display the changes that would be applied, were automatic migrations enabled?</p>
