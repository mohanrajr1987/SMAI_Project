<p>I'm seeing this really strange issue and for which not getting any search hits.</p>  <p>My simple code is adding entities to the DBContext's DBSet, very standard stuff. </p>  <p>But interestingly fails to add any new entities after 3035 adds. </p>  <p>I find this out because SaveChanges() fails with a primary key violation. Using SQL Profiler I see that the same entity in the 3035th iteration is attempted to be inserted into the table on the 3036th iteration. </p>  <p>I've verified that items 3035 and 3036 (and beyond) in the original list are indeed unique (ie no dupe entries in the original list).</p>  <p>Anybody know what could be going on?</p>  <p>My code is as follows (note: not focusing on perf right now):</p>  <pre><code>using (var db = new MyDBContext()) {     // Count of pocos is &gt; 5000     foreach (var poco in myListOfPOCOs)     {         db.MyDBSet.Add(poco);         db.MyDBset.SaveChanges(); // &lt;== This always fails on the 3036'th item        } } </code></pre>
