<p>I'm trying to add an ADO.NET Entity Data Model to my solution which uses an Oracle database (ODP.NET), but I get the following error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>"Your project references the latest version of Entity Framework;   however, an Entity Framework database provider compatible with this   version could not be found for your data connection.  If you have   already installed a compatible provider, ensure you have rebuilt your   project before performing this action.  Otherwise, exit this wizard,   install a compatible provider, and rebuild your project before   performing this action."</p> </blockquote>  <p>The dialog also says it is trying to use Entity Framework 6.x.</p>  <p>I'm using Visual Studio 2013, and it's an ASP.NET MVC 5 web application.  I have installed 64-bit ODAC 12c Release 3 (12.1.0.2.1) for Windows x64.</p>
