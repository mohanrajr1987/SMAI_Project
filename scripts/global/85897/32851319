<p>When I use power tools, for example, in a table that has few self relationships, the name of the properties of the mapped entities es a bad name, for example MyTablename1, MytableName11... and so on. So when I have to use this POCO entity in my code it's very hard to use this entity.</p>  <p>I would like to know to create the entities with other more descriptive names and easy to use. Or how is the way to go when I use reverse engineer? Because the name use to be very undescriptive and hard to use.</p>  <p>Thank you so much.</p>
