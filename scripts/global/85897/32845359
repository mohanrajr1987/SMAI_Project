<p>We are using this <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/dn481501.aspx" rel="nofollow">great guide</a> to manage migrations merge conflicts in our team environment.</p>  <p>We use the Option 1: Add a blank ‘merge’ migration, which basically adds an empty migration using the switch –IgnoreChanges. This effectively sync back the snapshot of the current model.</p>  <p>Let say that we added a 'merge' migration and all is well. Then we start new development and we add a 'real' migration following the 'merge' one. My question is, is it safe to delete the 'merge' migration after the 'real' has been applied ?</p>  <p>Ex:</p>  <ul> <li>M1</li> <li>M2</li> <li>M-Merge</li> <li>M3</li> </ul>  <p>Once 'M3' is applied, can we delete 'M-Merge' ?</p>  <p>I successfully did it without any problems. I can re-create the database from scratch. I can downgrade migration to M2. I just want to be sure I'm not overlooking some potential issues.</p>  <p>My goal is to cleanup those empty migrations.</p>
