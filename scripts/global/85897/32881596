<p>I have a WPF application build using SQL Server and Entity Framework 6.0. I have some predefined RDLC reports setup but now I want to provide users flexible querying system using which user can generate a report by specifying different criteria (Exactly like we do using TFS (Sample image below)). What is a good approach to achieve this?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5k6xM.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5k6xM.png" alt="enter image description here"></a> Tables in my database are structured like this Test Pack (this is the master table containing most of the information - 30 Fields) Documentation (5 Fields) LineWalks (5 Fields) Flushing (5 Fields) Testing (5 Fields) Reinstatement (5 Fields) PunchItems (12 Fields)</p>  <p><strong>Each TestPack may have 1-N Documentations, LineWalks, Flushing, Testing, Reinstatements, PunchItems. Fields inside the Documentation, LineWalks, Flushings, Testing, Reinstatement are all same</strong></p>  <p>I dont want to put a lot of hard coded conditions like <code>if else</code>. So what is a good approach to achieve this?</p>
