<p>We have a report which is available to many users.</p>  <p>We would like to save for each one his preferences ie report parameters in order to make it easier for them by having these parameters already filled every time  they run the report while leaving the possibility to modify these parameters if they wish.</p>  <p>The report parameters are:</p>  <ul> <li>A list which allow multiple values selection</li> <li>An input text</li> <li>Two date fields</li> </ul>  <p>As a solution, we may save the parameters values in a database. So each time the user runs the report, we get the parameters from the database and we set them as default values.</p>  <p>So how we can do that (in more details)? if there is a better solution feel free to suggest it.</p>  <p>Thanks for your help</p>
