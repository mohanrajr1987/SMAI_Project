<p>I'd like to pass parameters (values and functions) to an Angular directive. </p>  <p>I feel like this something like this exists in Angular, however I can't find it. Maybe I'm not using the correct search terms or terminology... </p>  <p>Example</p>  <pre><code>&lt;my-directive my-param="55" some-title="My title" click-callback="myOnClickCallback"&gt; &lt;/my-directive&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Is this doable? </p>
