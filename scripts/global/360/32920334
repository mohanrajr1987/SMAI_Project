<p>I'm trying to complete an assignment in BlueJ for uni and I've hit a snag at the first hurdle.</p>  <p>In the assignment, we are given a class, as well as the names of the constructor, methods, and parameters of that class. We're not allowed to change these because the assignments are partially marked by a test unit (or something to that effect).</p>  <p>One of the constructors for this class is given as</p>  <pre><code> public class PlayList  {     public PlayList(String name, ArrayList&lt;Track&gt; tracks) {     } </code></pre>  <p>And I have (partially) completed it as</p>  <pre><code>public class PlayList {    private String listName;    private ArrayList&lt;Track&gt; listTracks = new ArrayList&lt;Track&gt;();     /**     * Constructs a playlist with a title and an ArrayList of tracks     *      * @param name The name of the playlist     * @param tracks An ArrayList of tracks in the playlist     */    public PlayList(String name, ArrayList&lt;Track&gt; tracks) {        listName = name;        //I really don't know what to do with the tracks parameter yet    } </code></pre>  <p>Okay, so, I know from this question (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16018998/how-do-i-enter-parameters-for-an-arraylist-in-bluej">How do I enter parameters for an ArrayList in BlueJ?</a>) that I have to create an instance of an ArrayList in order to pass it as a parameter in BlueJ.</p>  <p>What I don't understand is <em>why</em> - why have they used <code>ArrayList&lt;Track&gt;</code> as a parameter for the constructor? What is the benefit of doing this?</p>  <p>(I figure there must be a benefit to doing it like this (if there wasn't the functionality wouldn't exist in the first place), but I don't understand <em>what</em> it is, and if someone could explain it to me, I'd be greatly appreciative.)</p>
