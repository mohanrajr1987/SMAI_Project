<p>I am attempting to use a parameter passed by an application to determine the WHERE clause in a query.  Based on the value in the parameter, it will determine the WHERE.  2 of the 3 WHERE options result in an evaluation of NULL.  The 3 potential WHERE statements are below and each work when applied independently.</p>  <pre><code>WHERE sSC.Description IS NOT NULL WHERE sSC.Description IS NULL WHERE sSC.Description = @Signature </code></pre>  <p>I attempted to execute this multiple variants but all have incorrect syntax.  Here is the most recent.</p>  <pre><code>DECLARE @Signature AS VARCHAR (max) SET @Signature = 'XXXPARAMETER1XXX'  Select *  FROM Operations.dbo.sSignatureClassification AS sSC WHERE      CASE @Signature         WHEN 'Without' THEN (sSC.Description IS NOT NULL)         WHEN 'With' THEN (sSC.Description IS NULL)         ELSE (sSC.Description = @Signature)     END </code></pre>
