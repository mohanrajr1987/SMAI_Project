<p>My googling of the question didn't return helpful results and the documentation for <code>?switch</code> doesn't tell me how so I'm hoping I can get this answered here.</p>  <p>Say I have a vector:</p>  <pre><code>cases&lt;- c("one","two","three") </code></pre>  <p>and I want to use a switch statement with those elements as the parameters for the switch statement:</p>  <pre><code>switch(input,cases) </code></pre>  <p>The above will only output anything if <code>input=1</code> in which case it will output:</p>  <pre><code>switch(1,cases) # [1] "one" "two" "three" </code></pre>  <p>Any other parameter will not return anything. The only way I can get the desired behavior is if I explicitly type the cases in the switch statement as such:</p>  <pre><code>switch(2,"one","two","three") # [1] "two" </code></pre>  <p>I want the behavior where I can pass a list/vector/whatever as a parameter in switch() and achieve the following behavior:</p>  <pre><code>switch(2,cases) # [1] "two" </code></pre>
