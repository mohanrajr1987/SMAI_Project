<p>I have the following code:</p>  <pre><code>var myObj = {apples:"five", pears:"two"};  function myFunction(x) {     alert(myObj.x); }; </code></pre>  <p>When I run <code>myFunction(apples)</code> I don't get an alert saying <code>five</code>, but I get an alert saying <code>undefined</code>.</p>  <p>How do I get the result I want by using the function parameter <code>x</code> with the object <code>myObj</code></p>  <p>The result I want is it to say 'five' instead of 'undefined'.</p>  <p>I'm sorry I have to ask such a dumb question, but I just started learning Javascript and I couldn't find this anywhere, hence I ask it here. I hope you can help me out :)</p>  <p>====== SOLVED =====</p>  <p>Thanks to everyone who posted and provided an answer :D Glad you guys could help me out so fast!</p>
