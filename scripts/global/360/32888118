<p>I have a servlet load_plan, which its doPost method loads a plan with this code:</p>  <pre><code>int id = Integer.parseInt(request.getParameter("id")); </code></pre>  <p>I have another servlet hire_new_plan, which its doGet method sends the id to the load_plan servlet.</p>  <pre><code>hire_new_plan doPost() --&gt; load_plan doGet(). </code></pre>  <p>How can I send the id from the doGet method so that I can capture it with the <code>request.getParameter()</code> in the doPost method of the receiver servlet?</p>  <p>There are two problems as I have read. </p>  <p>First of all, I can't call the doPost method from another servlet's doGet method.</p>  <p>Secondly, it seems as if the <code>request.setAttribute("id", id)</code> doesn't match with the <code>int id = Integer.parseInt(request.getParameter("id"));</code>. I execute in the receiver servlet.</p>  <p>What can I do to fix this?</p>
