<p>I'm working on spagobi 5.0 where I want to create a chart from two parameters: "idusuario" and "idnrc". Both are a list of values (LOV) from a query selectable for the user. The point is "idnrc" query need the "idusuario" parameter to show the list. I have been searching on the web but I don't find how to set spagobi for do that. </p>  <p>There is a "correlation analitical driver manager" option on the right corner with a "c" icon. Have I to use it? Somebody can tell me how to use it.</p>
