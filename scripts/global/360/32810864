<p>I have a immutable class F1:</p>  <pre><code>public class F1 {     public readonly int field1;     public readonly int field2;     public readonly int field3;     public readonly int field4;     public readonly int field5;      ......      public F1 SetField1(int f)     {         return new F1(f, field2, field3, field4, field5);     }     ......  } </code></pre>  <p>If i need to change one field, field1 for example, i need to return new instance of class from the method. All five field pass to constructor, even if four of them haven't been changed.</p>  <p>It's ok, if i use 5 fields. But if i use 40 fields and i can't pass 40 parametrs to constructor. What i need to do? How can I save values of other fields and create new instance without passes parameters to constructor?</p>  <blockquote>   <p>There is I really need immutable class. It's important condition of my work.</p> </blockquote>
