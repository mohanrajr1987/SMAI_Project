<p>How do I add Url parameters to my Affiliate links dynamically? For example, <a href="http://tracking.vcommission/aff_c?offer_id=110&amp;aff_id=42661" rel="nofollow">http://tracking.vcommission/aff_c?offer_id=110&amp;aff_id=42661</a> is my link and I want to add 'aff_sub' as a parameter and 'Himanshu' as a value, latter being dynamically generated. </p>
