<p>I am developing several plugin methods that generate a string, and pass it back to my main method. From here, I can then come up with a sequence number. However, I want to avoid integrating the plugin into my main program - basically anything that forces me to change my main program in any way to recognise this plugin is off-limits.</p>  <p>So - in my main program, I generate a string, then match it with other matching strings to figure out the sequence number. The trouble is that I need to know the format of this string so I know where to input this number.</p>  <p>I was thinking about possibly passing in a method that knows the matching functions for this string, but I'm not sure how I can pass a method from one program to another.</p>  <p>I have found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4015451/pass-a-method-as-a-parameter">this</a> question, but this only appears to be within the same program.</p>
