<p>I am wanting to open a recordset based on a query.  The query has 10 parameters that it matches to a form.  The parameters are a bit complex because they are searching for a partial string match.  </p>  <p>I have run into multiple issues and it appears access won't let me open a recordset based on a query that pulls parameters from a form.  Instead I am now trying to open a querydef and pass that to a recordset.  I am getting a run time error 13 type mismatch when I try to run the function now.  Is there a better way to do what I am trying to do?  Does anyone have any insight into fixing this error?  The error is highlighting the first parameter (export country) but if that one is a problem I am sure they all are.  Thanks! </p>  <p>*modified to try to pass conditional parameters through recordset instead</p>  <pre><code>Function StatementUpdate()  Dim dbs As DAO.Database Dim rstStatements As DAO.Recordset Dim rstCBG As DAO.Recordset Dim concStatement As String Dim strSQL As Variant   Set dbs = CurrentDb() strSQL = "SELECT [Statement] FROM [St_Gen_Qry] WHERE" _      &amp; " (([Statement Category]='General Information')" _      &amp; " And ([Export Country] Like '*" &amp; Forms!New_Shipment_Home_frm.[Export Country] &amp; "*'" _      &amp; " Or [Export Country]='All')" _      &amp; " And ([Export State] Like '*" &amp; Forms!New_Shipment_Home_frm.[Export State] &amp; "*'" _      &amp; " Or [Export State]='All')" _      &amp; " And ([Import Country] Like '*" &amp; Forms!New_Shipment_Home_frm.[Import Country] &amp; "*'" _      &amp; " Or [Import Country]='All')" _      &amp; " And ([Import State] Like '*" &amp; Forms!New_Shipment_Home_frm.[Import State] &amp; "*'" _      &amp; " Or [Import State]='All')" _      &amp; " And ([Shipment Type] Like '*" &amp; Forms!New_Shipment_Home_frm.[Shipment Type] &amp; "*'" _      &amp; " Or [Shipment Type]='All')" _      &amp; " And ([Material Category] Like '*" &amp; Forms!New_Shipment_Home_frm.[Material Category] &amp; "*'" _      &amp; " Or [Material Category]='All')" _      &amp; " And ([Sub Category] Like '*" &amp; Forms!New_Shipment_Home_frm.[Sub Category] &amp; "*'" _      &amp; " Or [Sub Category]='All')" _      &amp; " And ([Transgenic/ Conventional] Like '*" &amp; Forms!New_Shipment_Home_frm.RegCode &amp; "*'" _      &amp; " Or [Transgenic/ Conventional]='All')" _      &amp; " And ([Intended Use] Like '*" &amp; Forms!New_Shipment_Home_frm.[Intended Use] &amp; "*'" _      &amp; " Or [Intended Use]='All')" _      &amp; " And ([Permit] Like '*" &amp; Forms!New_Shipment_Home_frm.[Permit Required] &amp; "*'" _      &amp; " Or [Permit]='All')" _      &amp; " And ([Active]='Yes'));"  Set rstStatements = dbs.OpenRecordset(strSQL, dbOpenDynaset) Set rstCBG = dbs.OpenRecordset("SELECT Cross_Border_Grid_Table.ID,    Cross_Border_Grid_Table.St_General FROM Cross_Border_Grid_Table WHERE   (Cross_Border_Grid_Table.ID)= " &amp; [Forms]![New_Shipment_Home_frm]![Text105])   rstCBG.MoveFirst  'loop through each record in the CBG that matches select query Do Until rstCBG.EOF     concStatement = ""     rstStatements.MoveFirst     Do Until rstStatements.EOF         concStatement = concStatement &amp; vbCrLf &amp; rstStatements(0) &amp; vbCrLf         rstStatements.MoveNext     Loop         rstCBG.Edit         rstCBG![St_General] = concStatement         rstCBG.Update         rstCBG.MoveNext         Loop  rstCBG.Close rstStatements.Close  Set rstStatements = Nothing Set rstCBG = Nothing Set dbs = Nothing  Debug.Print "Done"  End Function </code></pre>
