<p>I am trying to create a map which will help freshers or blind people navigate through our college campus, and I want the map to show only our college campus. I am a total newbie ....</p>  <p>This is my process:</p>  <pre><code>1. User chooses the location 2. Map should identify current location 3. Map should draw route from current location to destination. 4. Map should start a voice navigation and should update as the user walks to their destination </code></pre>  <p>If someone could tell me how it would be great.... I have no idea on how to do this.</p>
