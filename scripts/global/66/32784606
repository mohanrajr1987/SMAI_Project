<p>I'm using modernUI with WPF in my desktop application. I use the code below to navigate to my usercontrol (acts like a page).</p>  <pre><code>NavigationCommands.GoToPage.Execute("/Pages/MyPage.xaml?Id=" + id, this); </code></pre>  <p>The navigation works well but the problem is that I don't know how I can get the Id passed as parameter. How can I fetch a parameter from MyPage.xaml?</p>
