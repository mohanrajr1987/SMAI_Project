<p>I'm new to Android development and I'm trying to create a similar UI to Snapchat. Where you have two or three activities beside each other and you can swipe between them or press a button to switch activity. How would I go about doing this?</p>  <p>I would appreciate any help.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
