<p>i am using navigation view for navigation drawer...and there are certain menu items int he drawer and when i clicked on a particular a new activity opens and i want to open navigation drawer from that activity too.. i tried one way in which i had to extends my main activity(the one having drawer) to the activity (or the second activity)...and add this in my second activity instead of setcontentview.. but the thing is my second activity xml is just above the mainactivity.xml.. i see both the activity one above the other(secondactivity above mainactivity.xml) how to just show only secondactivity with the drawer.</p>  <pre><code>LayoutInflater layoutInflater = (LayoutInflater)getSystemService(Context.LAYOUT_INFLATER_SERVICE);         View activityView = layoutInflater.inflate(R.layout.activity_credits, null,false);         // add the custom layout of this activity to frame layout.         drawerLayout.addView(activityView); </code></pre>
