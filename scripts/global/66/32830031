<p>I am having problems with my WordPress sub-menu, on a desktop computer it appears fine but on a mobile device it does not show? Is their anyway I can change this?</p>  <p>Also what file does the navigation code sit within? Hopefully I can have a look for myself and see if I can change some code to get it to show on mobile devices?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
