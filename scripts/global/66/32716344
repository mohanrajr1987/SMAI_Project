<p>I don't manage to add a navigation arrow to my portfolio. I would like to get next and prev id based on current id. The issue is when the <code>$current_id</code> is the last of array, I don't know how to go to the first one to create a kind of loop. And the same if the <code>$current_id</code> is the first element, how to have the last element as prev ? I'm stuck, can you please help me ? </p>  <p>Here is my code:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php       $current_id = "10";      $array = array(         "1" =&gt; "aa",         "2" =&gt; "bb",         "3" =&gt; "cc",         "4" =&gt; "dd",         "5" =&gt; "ee",         "6" =&gt; "ff",         "7" =&gt; "gg",         "8" =&gt; "hh",         "9" =&gt; "ii",         "10" =&gt; "jj",     );       $current_index = array_search($current_id, $array);      $next = $current_index + 1;     $prev = $current_index - 1;  ?&gt; </code></pre>
