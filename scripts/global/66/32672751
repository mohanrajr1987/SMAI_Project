<p>I'm programming a Simple navigation app and have a MapView with a MKDirections calculation displayed as a polyline in a overlay.</p>  <p>I'm really struggling to find any help online to allow the route to be recalculated automatically when the used deviates form the navigation route (polyline). </p>  <p>Does anyone know if there is a way of doing this? I guess you could calculate the distance from the route (polyline) and if that deviates by a certain amount trigger a recalculation but that seems really complex for what should be quite straight forward?</p>  <p>I'm using swift and only really have experience with swift.</p>  <p>Thanks for your help.</p>
