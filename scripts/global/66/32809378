<p>I am developing basic navigation for my app, and am trying to implement a tab bar controller for the navigation.</p>  <p>I added a Tab Bar Controller and linked it to Navigation Controllers, but for some reason the items and icons don't show up. The Tab Bar works though, so when I run simulator I can switch between the views correctly, but it displays as completely blank.</p>  <p>What should I do to add the items and icons to it?</p>
