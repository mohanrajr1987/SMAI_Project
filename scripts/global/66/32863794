<p>I'm trying to develop a <strong>PHP</strong> live streaming website. Im trying for a player that automatically moves to corner of a page and plays video without interrupting even while navigating within site. I know we can achieve this with Ajax and jQuery. I'm little confused from where to start.. </p>  <p>I have individual pages and passing URL to player through ajax but when I click on link video starts from beginning </p>  <p>I found it in <a href="http://www.dadabhagwan.tv" rel="nofollow">this</a> website.  Thanks in Advance...</p>
