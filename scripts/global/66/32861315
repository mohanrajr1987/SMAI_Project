<p>In my gallery I set the hash into the URL for every different Image which is displayed, so I can navigate to this directly via URL later.</p>  <p>But the problem is: If the user navigates back, he will get through every image he viewed. I want to navigate back to "real" URL without the hash. Is this possible?</p>  <p><strong>Referrer</strong></p>  <pre><code>http://mydomain.de/othersite </code></pre>  <p><strong>Current URL</strong></p>  <pre><code>http://mydomain.de/gallery#image-5 </code></pre>  <p>I want to navigate to back to referrer via </p>  <pre><code>history.back() </code></pre>  <p>or something like this.</p>
