<p>I'm trying to create a Website for school that's an anatomy atlas of the brain. Because there are so many structures and views I want to have the visitor select from several options and hit Go to take them to the right place in the brain. The First option: MRI or Photo. The Second option: The viewing plane (axial, coronal, sagittal) and finally a structure in that particular view plane where they would like studying. I'm coding it in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Thanks.</p>
