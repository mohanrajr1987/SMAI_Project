<p>I am using ViewPager inside my Navigation Drawer and am encountering an issue when I want to swipe to next tab in ViewPager. Swiping works in direction which opens Navigation Drawer but doesn't work in direction which closes Navigation drawer.</p>  <p>That means I can normally swipe to ViewPager pages to "right" direction but when I want to swipe to the "left", NavigationDrawer intercepts touch events and closes itself.</p>  <p>I would still like to have ability for navigation drawer to close if user swipes on content which doesn't have horizontal scroll. How can I accomplish something like this? Thank you.</p>
