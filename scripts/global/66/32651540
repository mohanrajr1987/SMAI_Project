<p>Hi I'm new to this and have searched but couldnt quite find the solution. I believe SP Sercices will be the tool, but no examples satisfied my requirement,  hope you can help.</p>  <p>What I have</p>  <p>-Custom Publishing site with main nav and sub nav (store related)</p>  <p>-Main nav is global and all users across sites can access</p>  <p>-Sub navs are store related meaning each of our stores sub nav is proprietary to each stores content.</p>  <p>-Sub nav links are the same for all store sub navs</p>  <p>-example sub nav links: our staff, store news, store calendar.</p>  <p>-Sub nav is using managed terms. *Please inform if using simple links are better approach although id perfer to do this programaticaly rather than manual. </p>  <p>What im trying to do</p>  <p>-Have store sub nav URL links coorelate only to store specific group members. Ex: Florida store users click "our staff" and are taken to Florida store staff page.  When California store users click "our staff" they are taken to California store staff page. This should hold true for all links in sub nav. </p>  <p>Let me know if im lacking information.</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
