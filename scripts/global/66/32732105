<p>So I've been scratching my head for the last two hours over this little issue. I can see the HTML code in inspect element. </p>  <p>But cannot find it anywhere. I've looked at all the files including the css, javascript and also sass files. Is there a method on the inspect elements that can accurately show me the code file? So far is seems to think it's in the index.html file.. </p>  <p>Looking forward to your responses </p>
