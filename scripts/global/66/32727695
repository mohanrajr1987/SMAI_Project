<p>i have a little problem, i want to add a line that separates other tabs from last one, but i dunno how to do it, if you dont understand what im talking here is few pictures.</p>  <p>So, my page is responsive and i want that straight line to be visible only on desktop version of site(but that is not problem) so i added the background-image on whole nav div, and on my screen it looks like this : <a href="http://i.imgur.com/BOX3RiT.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i.imgur.com/BOX3RiT.jpg</a> .</p>  <p>but on some smaller or bigger desktop screens that line moves left or right depending on screen size so this is how it looks when the screen is little bit smaller : <a href="http://i.imgur.com/R1U1xqq.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i.imgur.com/R1U1xqq.jpg</a> , so what i want? i want that one line to stay always the same in between of these nav bars!! so i get it that bg-image is not gonna work cause div is responsive but how can i stuck that line so it doesnt move nowhere? any help i would be verry grateful. Thanks :)</p>
