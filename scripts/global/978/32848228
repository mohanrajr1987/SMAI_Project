<p>I have outlook version 14.4.6, outlook 2011, on my MacBook Pro.  I'm having trouble exporting all the email addresses from a specific folder.  With outlook on my PC the process is simple, I just go to file>export>folder and I can export the folder as a .csv the email addresses are all in the "from" column.  But when I try to do something similar with my mac outlook all I get is a tab delimited file with only one email address in it.  When I check contacts in my mac outlook it also only shows one email address.  There are over 14K emails in the folder.</p>  <p>Any tips are greatly appreciated.</p>
