<p>In my VB.NET application (Framework 3.5) I'm currently looking for the users signature in Outlook 2013.  Then either reading the .HTM or .TXT file.</p>  <pre><code>Dim Signature_Dir As String = Environ("APPDATA") &amp; "\Microsoft\Signatures\" </code></pre>  <p>This is great assuming the <strong>New Messages</strong> signature is titled "Default.htm" or "Default.txt".</p>  <p>However, many of our users have multiple signatures.  I want to use the signature listed in the "New Messages" section of Outlook (shown below, highlighted in yellow).</p>  <p>Is there any way to read the "New Messages" property to determine which signature to read?  I do know the active users email address to determine which account to look at.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/432CE.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/432CE.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <hr>  <p><strong>Edit</strong> -- could I maybe create a new MailMessage (which would auto-populate their signature) and then somehow read the text (which should only contain the signature) from that MailMessage object?</p>
