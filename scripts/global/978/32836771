<p>I am trying to merge mails by extracting the last message in the a conversation thread. I want to keep the formatting intact so i am trying to get the last message along with the html. I am referencing Microsoft HTML Object Library like this</p>  <pre><code>Dim mi As MailItem Set mi = ActiveExplorer.Selection.Item(1) Dim bhtml As HTMLBody Set bhtml = mi.HTMLBody </code></pre>  <p>This is giving a type mismatch error. </p>
