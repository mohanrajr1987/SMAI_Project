<p>I've created a custom add in for Outlook 2010.  When I hover over the button, there's a help section with a cog image that says <strong>Press F1 for Add-in Help</strong>.  I would like to remove this so it's not visible when the user hovers over the button but can't find where/how to do so.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Hz7aO.gif" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Hz7aO.gif" alt="Outlook Add In Hover Help"></a></p>
