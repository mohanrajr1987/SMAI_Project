<p>I have a VBA macro in an Excel workbook that creates Outlook appointments with a special tag in the users calendar. Before it adds new appointments, it first deletes all appointments that have this tag in the items body. Unfortunately, the Outlook.AppointmentItem.Delete function sometimes does not work. When I have my Outlook calendar opened I can see that the item is deleted for a very short amount of time and instantly reappears. This happens only occasionally.</p>  <p>I can force that behavior by duplicating an AppointmentItem with the specific tag two times. Then, only two of the appointments are going to be deleted and one stays in the calendar.</p>  <p>Can anyone explain what might cause this behavior?</p>  <pre><code>Public Sub DeleteAppointment(Starttime As Date, Endtime As Date)      Dim myStart As Date     Dim myEnd As Date     Dim olApp As Outlook.Application     Dim oCalendar As Outlook.Folder     Dim oItems As Outlook.Items     Dim oItemsInDateRange As Outlook.Items     Dim oAppt As Outlook.AppointmentItem     Dim strRestriction As String     Dim olNs As Outlook.Namespace     Dim blnCreated As Boolean      On Error Resume Next     Set olApp = Outlook.Application      If olApp Is Nothing Then         Set olApp = Outlook.Application         blnCreated = True         Err.Clear     Else         blnCreated = False     End If      On Error GoTo 0      myStart = Starttime     myEnd = DateAdd("h", 24, Starttime)      'MsgBox ("Searching from " &amp; Format(myStart, "mm.dd.yyyy hh:mm") &amp; " to " &amp; Format(myEnd, "mm.dd.yyyy hh:mm"))      'Construct filter for the range     strRestriction = "[Start] &lt;= '" &amp; myEnd &amp; "' AND [End] &gt;= '" &amp; myStart &amp; "'"      ' Set Outlook Objects     Set olNs = olApp.GetNamespace("MAPI")     Set oCalendar = olNs.GetDefaultFolder(olFolderCalendar)     Set oItems = oCalendar.Items      oItems.IncludeRecurrences = True     oItems.Sort "[Start]"     'Restrict the Items collection for the range     Set oItemsInDateRange = oItems.Restrict(strRestriction)     oItemsInDateRange.Sort "[Start]"      For Each oAppt In oItemsInDateRange         'MsgBox ("Found item " &amp; oAppt.Subject &amp; " from " &amp; oAppt.Start &amp; " to " &amp; oAppt.End)         If (InStr(oAppt.Body, OutlookTag) &lt;&gt; 0) Then             'MsgBox ("Found an appointment that I generated. Going to delete it." &amp; oAppt.Subject)             oAppt.Delete             Set oAppt = Nothing         End If     Next End Sub </code></pre>
