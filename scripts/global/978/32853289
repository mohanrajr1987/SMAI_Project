<p>I'm trying to link To a specific PDF page from MsOutlook'10 or MsWord'10, the #page=... anchor is particularly useful and works fine elsewhere. Unfortunately when I click [ctr-K] in Outlook or Winword, my links are re-formatted assuming a UNC path. The PDF file is located on a shared drive.</p>  <p>Using the "file:" prefix links will open a PDF in Adobe Reader (outside of the browser), and "http:" will open inside a browser. The issue is that I seem to need to open in a browser with the "file:" prefix in order for an anchor to work. I know the anchors work inside a browser. Outlook uses the Windows/Explorer Default Program (based on file extension) which always seems to open in Adobe Reader neglecting my anchor.</p>  <p>Common references:</p>  <ul> <li><a href="http://blog.mailermailer.com/tips-resources/anchor-tags-html-emails" rel="nofollow">mailermailer.com/...anchor-tags-html-emails</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/email-marketing/2010/11/the-trouble-with-anchor-links-in-email-newsletters/" rel="nofollow">campaignmonitor.com/...anchor-links-in-email-newsletters/</a></li> <li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13427302/linking-from-a-web-page-to-a-specific-section-anchor-in-pdf-document">stackoverflow.com/...anchor-in-pdf-document</a></li> </ul>
