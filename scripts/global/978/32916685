<p>I am trying to get the text value(s) of the conditions for a rule that I have set up in MS Outlook.  </p>  <p>I have created a rule named "TestRule" with a condition based on text in the message Body (it must have the text "zzz" in it) and also a condition based on text in the Message Header (it must have the text "aaa" in it).  (Of course, this rule will probably never run, this is just to test for whether I can read the conditions in the rule.)  The rule and the conditions are enabled.</p>  <p>Here is the code that I am using</p>  <pre><code>Dim olRules As Outlook.Rules Dim olRule As Outlook.Rule  Set olRules = Application.Session.DefaultStore.GetRules Set olRule = olRules.Item("TestRule")  Debug.Print olRule.Conditions.Body.Text Debug.Print olRule.Conditions.MessageHeader.Text </code></pre>  <p>However, both debug.print lines give an error of "Type mismatch".</p>  <p>How can I read the current value of the conditions?</p>  <p>(I <em>have</em> checked and double-checked:  there <em>is</em> a rule named "TestRule".)</p>
