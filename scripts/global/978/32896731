However, the extracted data(subject of e-mail, etc) aren't populated in my worksheet. From what I can gather I've set the worksheet variable correctly, don't really know what's going on. </p>  <p>Thanks for all the help</p>  <hr>  <p>Update:</p>  <p>Worksheet is populating now. I am trying to get the code to go through a column of e-mail addresses, and extract "time received" from the emails if the addresses match with those in my folders.</p>
