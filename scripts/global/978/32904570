<p>I've tried to port over some code that worked in Visual Studio 2013 and adapt it for a new project in Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition with the Office developer addin.</p>  <p>I'm not quite sure what I've done differently, but this time round Outlook 2013 isn't displaying the ribbon tab that I created. It's not disabled, and it's not available in the "Customize Ribbon" dialogue either.</p>  <p>Sorry to be so vague, but I'm at a loss as to what to check and where to start to resolve this. I've attached a quick screengrab showing the tab I was hoping for and the debugger attached to the right outlook instance.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/HWoVp.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/HWoVp.jpg" alt="in debug, attached to the correct pid, nothing showing"></a>.</p>
