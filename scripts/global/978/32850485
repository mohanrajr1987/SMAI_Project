<p>I want to write some VBA code that will automatically create a new email from an RTF document. I'm using the following programs: 1. Microsoft Word 2013 2. Microsoft Outlook 2013</p>  <p>I have managed to do everything I want except how to paste the content that I copied into the body of the email.</p>  <p>I have searched all over the web for how to do this however I have not found any simple way of doing this. In addition, all of the examples that I have found were related to Microsoft Excel. I have noticed that there is a difference when using Microsoft Word.</p>  <p>Below is the code that I have written:</p>  <pre><code>Sub SendDocAsMail()  Dim oOutlookApp As Outlook.Application Dim oItem As Outlook.MailItem Dim TheUser As String Dim Subject As String Dim ClientRef As String Dim Body As String Dim Signature As String Dim SigString As String Dim i As Integer Dim Pos As Integer Dim myAttachments As Outlook.Attachments  TheUser = Environ("UserName")  On Error Resume Next  'Start Outlook if it isn't running Set oOutlookApp = GetObject(, "Outlook.Application") If Err &lt;&gt; 0 Then     Set oOutlookApp = CreateObject("Outlook.Application") End If  'Create a new message Set oItem = oOutlookApp.CreateItem(olMailItem)  'Copy the open document to subject and body  'Change only Mysig.htm to the name of your signature     SigString = Environ("appdata") &amp; _                 "\Microsoft\Signatures\" &amp; TheUser &amp; ".htm"  Selection.MoveDown Unit:=wdLine, Count:=1, Extend:=wdExtend Subject = Selection.Text Subject = Left(Subject, Len(Subject) - 1) ClientRef = Subject ClientRef = Right(ClientRef, Len(ClientRef) - 1) For i = 1 To Len(ClientRef)     If Mid(ClientRef, i, 1) = "|" Then         Pos = i     End If Next i ClientRef = Left(ClientRef, Pos - 1)  Selection.Delete Unit:=wdCharacter, Count:=1 Selection.Delete Unit:=wdCharacter, Count:=1 Selection.EndKey Unit:=wdStory Selection.TypeParagraph Selection.TypeParagraph Selection.InsertFile (SigString)  Selection.WholeStory Selection.Copy  oItem.To = "xxxx@xxxx.co.il; xxxx@xxxx.co.il" oItem.BCC = "xxxx@xxxx.co.uk" oItem.Subject = Subject 'oItem.Body = 'NEED HELP 'Selection.PasteAndFormat (wdFormatOriginalFormatting)  oItem.Display  Set myAttachments = oItem.Attachments 'myAttachments.Add.PathName = "C:\Users\" &amp; TheUser &amp; "\Dropbox\PATENT\Bressler\" &amp; ClientRef &amp; "\" 'Clean up '    Word.ActiveDocument.Close SaveChanges:=wdDoNotSaveChanges '    Word.Application.Quit SaveChanges:=wdDoNotSaveChanges   End Sub </code></pre>  <p>All help in pasting the copy text with the original formatting would be greatly appreciated.</p>
