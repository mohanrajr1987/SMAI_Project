<p>When I try and create an HTML email signature and choosing it as my signature in Outlook the resulting display is horrendous. It literally ignores all the inline styles I specify on my text (eg, font-size:13px) and appears to enlarge things by about 66%. Even when I use the signature editor, my images end up enlarged. All the content lives inside a table layout.</p>  <p>I've tried many fixes from around the web, including opening the HTML in a browser and selecting all, then copying and pasting into the editor window. Even when I insert the image via the editor, it still comes out at that bigger size on the receiver's end. I've tried adding additional headers too.</p>  <p>I'd appreciate any input to help me solve this. The signature works fine in Thunderbird.</p>
