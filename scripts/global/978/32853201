<p>good afternoon all,  i am new to outlook vba so i don't even know if the following task is possible. I have a folder where i drag and drop emails from certain clients, these emails have 1 -2 attachments (excel files) and i want to auto save them in a desktop folder.</p>  <p>The difficult part is that the attachment needs to be saved like this:</p>  <ul> <li>sender's email is anthony@example.com then save the attachment as 101</li> <li>sender's email is george@example.com then save the attachment as 102</li> <li>sender's email is john@example.com then save the attachment as 123</li> <li>etc. is that possible?</li> </ul>  <p>thanks in advance</p>
