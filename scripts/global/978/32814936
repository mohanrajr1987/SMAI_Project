<p>I am trying to find a way to create Outlook .OFT files with Excel VBA.</p>  <p><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/aa220081(v=office.11).aspx" rel="nofollow">THIS</a> seems to nearly accomplish what I want but it's not an Excel VBA, its for Outlook and will give you an error if you run it in Excel.</p>  <p>I've been googling around for quite a while now, any help is appreciated.</p>  <p>Due to the conditions of what I'm trying to accomplish I actually do need to create OFT files. The Replace command to change existing OFT files doesn't seem useful.</p>
