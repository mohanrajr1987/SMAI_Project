<p>I have created a custom contact form (TestForm) on Outlook 2010. When I right click an email address within an email (eg. Sender email) I can get the context menu to appear (Add to TestForm).</p>  <p>I have the following code that opens a generic form when I click the context menu.</p>  <pre><code> Public Sub button2_Click(control As Office.IRibbonControl)      ' Create an Outlook application.     Dim oApp As Outlook.Application = New Outlook.Application()      ' Get the namespace and the logon.     Dim oNS As Outlook.NameSpace = oApp.GetNamespace("MAPI")      ' Create a new contact item.     Dim oCt As Outlook.ContactItem = oApp.CreateItem(Outlook.OlItemType.olContactItem)     oCt.Display(True)  'Modal         ' Set some common properties.     oCt.FullName = "John Smith"     oCt.Title = "Engineer"     oCt.CompanyName = "Client 1 "     oCt.Email1Address = "johnsmith@company.com"   End Sub </code></pre>  <p>My question is, how do I modify the VB code so that firstly: 1. My custom for (TestForm) opens instead of the default outlook contact form. 2. Automatically populate the email address field with the email that I right clicked in the first place.</p>  <p>Thanks for your help.</p>
