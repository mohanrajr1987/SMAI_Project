<p>How can I copy a recurring appointment in outlook 2013 with VBA? I've tried copying the RecurrencePattern Object from the source item to the destination item (cAppt), but this sets the start date to the next immediate calendar interval (e.g. if it is 4:12 now, the recurring series is set to start at today at 4:30) instead of the actual start date of the original item. Any hints on how to do this?</p>  <pre><code>Private Sub curCal_ItemAdd(ByVal Item As Object) Dim cAppt As AppointmentItem Dim oPatt As RecurrencePattern Dim cPatt As RecurrencePattern Dim moveCal As AppointmentItem  ' On Error Resume Next  'only copy items not marked as private If Item.Sensitivity &lt;&gt; olPrivate Then     Item.Body = Item.Body &amp; "[" &amp; GetGUID &amp; "]"    Item.Save  Set cAppt = Application.CreateItem(olAppointmentItem) If Item.IsRecurring Then     Set cPatt = cAppt.GetRecurrencePattern     cPatt = Item.GetRecurrencePattern End If  With cAppt     .Subject = Item.Subject     .Start = Item.Start     .Duration = Item.Duration     .Location = Item.Location     .Body = Item.Body End With  ' set the category after it's moved to force EAS to sync changes  Set moveCal = cAppt.Move(newCalFolder)  moveCal.Categories = "moved"  moveCal.Save  End If End Sub </code></pre>
