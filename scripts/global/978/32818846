<p>I have a C# Outlook add-in that has a FormRegion in it. Add-in checks if the message contains certain header and shows its value in the form region. It works properly, but sometimes (every 1-2 days), it throws the warning message:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The form region "FormRegionName" cannot be opened. An add-in returned an invalid value while loading the form region storage.</p> </blockquote>  <p>It is need to restart the Outlook to continue the work after that message.</p>  <p>The COM objects are releasing properly in the add-in. I found in the Web the suggestion that this can be resolved with clearing the Outlook form cache, but i found no way to make it programmatically. </p>
