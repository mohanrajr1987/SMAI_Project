<p>I'm trying to move a mail item form 1 store to another, using Outlook 2010 and C#</p>  <p>I'm gotten quite far, but not sure how I perform the 'move'. I'm assuming it's saveas and then delete</p>  <p>My attempt (code greatly reduced)</p>  <pre><code>         foreach (var mail in folder.Items)            {             //I am in the correct folder, and all I want to do is move all items to the 'inbox' of the store. I have already gotten the destination store and saved it as a variable called store                Microsoft.Office.Interop.Outlook.MailItem mailItem = (Microsoft.Office.Interop.Outlook.MailItem)mail; //got the item               mailItem.SaveAs(store.FilePath, Microsoft.Office.Interop.Outlook.OlSaveAsType.olMSG); // throws exception              mailItem.Delete();            } </code></pre>  <p>I'm not sure if this is the best approach, but the line <code>mailItem.SaveAs(store.FilePath, Microsoft.Office.Interop.Outlook.OlSaveAsType.olMSG);</code> throws an exception:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The operation failed</p> </blockquote>  <p>I see no more detail other than that</p>
