<p>I am looking for a macro coding which will give pop up/block email when entering restricted email address in TO/CC/BCC field.</p>  <p>For example: I want to restrict an email address as (<a href="http://abc@domain.com" rel="nofollow">abc@domain.com</a>) and while a user using Outlook 2010, and drafting a mail with TO/CC/BCC with email address (abc@domain.com) and pressing send email key, a pop up will ask if you really want to send this email to (abc@domain.com)</p>  <p>If anyone can help me in writing the macro.</p>
