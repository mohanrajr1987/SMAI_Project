<p>I have written a macro that automatically creates a new email message. I would like the macro to open up the "attach file" dialog. Within the dialogue I would like to browse to a predefined location on my computer.</p>  <p>Any ideas of how to do that?</p>  <p>I'm utilizing the following programs: 1. Microsoft Word 2013 2. Microsoft Outlook 2013</p>  <p>Here is the code that I have already written:</p>  <pre><code>Sub SendDocAsMail()  Dim oOutlookApp As Outlook.Application Dim oItem As Outlook.MailItem Dim TheUser As String Dim Subject As String Dim ClientRef As String Dim Body As String Dim Signature As String Dim SigString As String Dim i As Integer Dim Pos As Integer Dim myAttachments As Outlook.Attachments Dim mailWord As Object 'WordEditor  TheUser = Environ("UserName")  On Error Resume Next  'Start Outlook if it isn't running Set oOutlookApp = GetObject(, "Outlook.Application") If Err &lt;&gt; 0 Then     Set oOutlookApp = CreateObject("Outlook.Application") End If  'Create a new message Set oItem = oOutlookApp.CreateItem(olMailItem)  'Copy the open document to subject and body  'Change only Mysig.htm to the name of your signature     SigString = Environ("appdata") &amp; _                 "\Microsoft\Signatures\" &amp; TheUser &amp; ".htm"  Selection.MoveDown Unit:=wdLine, Count:=1, Extend:=wdExtend Subject = Selection.Text Subject = Left(Subject, Len(Subject) - 1) ClientRef = Subject ClientRef = Right(ClientRef, Len(ClientRef) - 1) For i = 1 To Len(ClientRef)     If Mid(ClientRef, i, 1) = "|" Then         Pos = i     End If Next i ClientRef = Left(ClientRef, Pos - 1)  Selection.Delete Unit:=wdCharacter, Count:=1 Selection.Delete Unit:=wdCharacter, Count:=1 Selection.EndKey Unit:=wdStory Selection.TypeParagraph Selection.TypeParagraph Selection.InsertFile (SigString)  Selection.WholeStory Selection.Copy  oItem.To = "XXX@XXX.com; XXX@XXX.com" oItem.BCC = "XXX@dXXX.com" oItem.Subject = Subject     oItem.Display Set mailWord = oItem.GetInspector.WordEditor mailWord.Range(0).PasteAndFormat (wdFormatOriginalFormatting)  Set myAttachments = oItem.Attachments 'myAttachments.Add.PathName = "C:\Users\" &amp; TheUser &amp; "\Dropbox\PATENT\Bressler\" &amp; ClientRef &amp; "\" 'Clean up '    Word.ActiveDocument.Close SaveChanges:=wdDoNotSaveChanges '    Word.Application.Quit SaveChanges:=wdDoNotSaveChanges   End Sub </code></pre>
