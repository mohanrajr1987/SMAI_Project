<p>I have created a Outlook add-ins in Visual Studio 2013 which takes 1.719 seconds to load in Outlook. Is there any way to minimize this loading time? </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/JIpL3.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/JIpL3.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
