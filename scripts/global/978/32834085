<p>I am having a image quality issue from one of my OSX users.</p>  <p>When this users send emails from his MS Outlook from his Mac computer, the image from signature shows in low quality on PC computers (MS Outlook/IE/Chrome).</p>  <p>Example:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>User send me an email;</p>      <p>If I open the email from my Windows Outlook/IE/Chrome, the image is on low quality;</p>      <p>If I copy the image from the email and paste on Word, the image looks fine;</p>      <p>If I open the email from the webmail using an iPhone or Mac computer, the image looks fine;</p> </blockquote>  <p>I understand that the problem is something related with the browser engine. However I have another users using Mac's with the same signature and they don't have this problem.</p>  <p>Thanks for the help!</p>
