<p>I am trying to extract attachments from a mail and attach those files to another mail Item.</p>  <p>Everything works fine but if I try to add an attachment wich has a blocked extension, the attachment won't get added to the mail item. Following is what I have done:</p>  <pre><code>private void addAttachments( Redemption.RDOMail sourceMail , ref Redemption.RDOMail targetMail )                 {     foreach (Redemption.RDOAttachment attachment in sourceMail.Attachments)     {         // Saving attachment files from source mail on local disk          attachment.SaveAsFile(/*File Path*/);          // adding attachment to target mail from saved location         //At this point, target mail has the attachment count incremented         targetMail.Attachments.Add(/*File PAth*/ + attachment.DisplayName);          // deleting file, saved on local disk         File.Delete(/*File Path + attachment.DisplayName*/);                        }      targetMail.Save();      // when the mail item is being displayed, the added attachment with the *.EXE,     //or all the other attachment extentions which are blocked from viewing by outlook is gone.     // This does not happen for other attachment files     targetMail.Display(); } </code></pre>  <p>Why these particular attachment types won't get displayed?</p>
