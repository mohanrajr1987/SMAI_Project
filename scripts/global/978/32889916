<p>I know this question has been sort of asked, but I have a specific issue which I haven't found the answer for. I am trying to open a shared calendar from another user and his/her calendar is NOT their default calendar. </p>  <p>I have tried the following:</p>  <pre><code>    var ns = Globals.ThisAddIn.Application.Session;      var recip = ns.CreateRecipient("me@me.com");     if (recip.Resolve())     {       var sharedCal = ns.GetSharedDefaultFolder(recip, Outlook.OlDefaultFolders.olFolderCalendar);     } </code></pre>  <p>This just does not work.</p>  <p>I can see the shared calendar by doing the following</p>  <pre><code>private void GetCalendars()         {              Outlook.CalendarModule calModule = (Outlook.CalendarModule)this.Application.ActiveExplorer().NavigationPane.Modules.GetNavigationModule(Outlook.OlNavigationModuleType.olModuleCalendar);               foreach (Outlook.NavigationGroup group in calModule.NavigationGroups)              {                 Debug.WriteLine("Calandar Folders Group  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;" + group.Name);                   foreach (Outlook.NavigationFolder folder in group.NavigationFolders)                 {                      Debug.WriteLine("Calandar Folders:  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;" + folder.DisplayName);                  }             }         } </code></pre>  <p>I just don't know how to open the calendar once I have the name. There is no way to get the ID using the steps above</p>  <p>In outlook, the calendar exists in the "Shared Calendars" navigation tree.</p>  <p>I am looking for a way to get the names of the Shared Calendars and then having the user select the shared calendar (E.g. From a dropdown box) and then opening that calendar. </p>  <p>I have found code on how to do everything else but not that specifically!</p>  <p>Can someone point me in the right direction??</p>  <p>Thanks!!</p>
