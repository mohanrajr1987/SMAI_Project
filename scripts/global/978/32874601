<p>I receive emails on a daily basis. The email has a secured pdf attachment. When I double click it I have to enter a password to open it. After it is open I double click a link and it will open a txt document.</p>  <p>I want to be able to automatically open the attachments and save the txt file in a central location.</p>  <p>Right now I am having trouble opening or saving the attachment. Does anyone have an idea how to use Python to open it?</p>  <p>Here is my code as of now:</p>  <pre><code>import win32com.client  outlook = win32com.client.Dispatch("Outlook.Application").GetNamespace("MAPI") inbox = outlook.GetDefaultFolder(6).Folders('Homebanking')  messages = inbox.Items message = messages.GetLast() attachments = message.Attachments attachment = attachments.Item(1) attachment.SaveASFile(path) </code></pre>  <p>error message:</p>  <pre><code>com_error: (-2147352567, 'Exception occurred.', (4096, u'Microsoft Outlook', u"Cannot save the attachment. You don't have appropriate permission to perform this operation.", None, 0, -2147024891), None) </code></pre>
