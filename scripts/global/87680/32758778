<p>I want to know why when using the same name for a dynamic kendo grid and its div, it is not a problem, the grid works well but it will be placed in the from of the div as the scroll will not function properly or so.  But when adding a kendo grid with the same name as its div for a Model type grid the grid does not show off and it is not working !</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div id="testgrid"&gt; @(Html.Kendo().Grid&lt;WEB02.ConfigurationModel.TestGrid&gt;() .Name("testgrid")   &lt;div id="Browsegrid"&gt;  @(Html.Kendo().Grid&lt;dynamic&gt;() .Name("BrowseGrid") </code></pre>
