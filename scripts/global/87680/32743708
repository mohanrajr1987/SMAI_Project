<p>I have a kendo grid and the Edit event opens a popup using the below piece of code.</p>  <pre><code>            editable: { mode: "popup",             template: kendo.template($("#popup_editor").html()),             update: true,             destroy: true,             confirmation: "Are you sure you want to remove this employee? Click OK to delete record."         } </code></pre>  <p>The popup again has (popup_editor template) grid in it. The subgrid's edit is set to 'inline'. So my question here is ....</p>  <p>I want the subrid's Edit do the inine edit. But I want the 'Add new' (toolbar: [{ name: "create", text: "Add New Employee" }]) functionality to popup a template. Is this possible?</p>
