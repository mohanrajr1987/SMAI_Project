<p>I have an AngularJS app and am currently trying to insert a Kendo Grid.  I have a couple of questions about how to make this work.</p>  <ol> <li><p>I have a dropdown on the page that based on the selected value in that list, the grid should be updated for the information retrieved from the server for the selection.  I have tried to make my dataSource: data (i.e. data: $scope.model.waivers) be an object in my model but do not get any results for that.  I have been able to use the following code to get my initial results but nothing when the selection changes.</p>  <pre><code>transport: {             read: function(e) {                 waiverService.getCustomers($scope.model.customer.CustomerID)                     .success(function(data, status, headers, config) {                     e.success(data);                 });             }         } </code></pre></li> <li><p>My second issue is I have several dropdown boxes on each row of the grid.  I have tried to use the information found in this <a href="http://jsbin.com/obufum/5/edit?html,js,output" rel="nofollow">example</a> but I am getting a ReferenceError: getCategoryName is not defined.</p>  <p>Can anyone provide help with either of these issues?</p></li> </ol>
