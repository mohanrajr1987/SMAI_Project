<p>I am using a Kendo Grid with AngularJs and TypeScript. I am able to get the selected row but I cannot assign the result to a local variable as it seems to run in a different scope.</p>  <p>My grid has the following properties:</p>  <pre><code>this.gridOptions = {     dataSource: {       data: this.items,       pageSize: 10     },     selectable: 'row',     filterable: {       mode: 'row'     },     change: this.onItemSelect, ... } </code></pre>  <p>The typescript function is as follows:<br/></p>  <pre><code>onItemSelect(kendoEvent : any) {   var grid = kendoEvent.sender;   this.selectedItem = grid.dataItem(grid.select()); } </code></pre>  <p>selectedItem is defined in my Controller class:</p>  <pre><code>export class ServicePackageModalController { private selectedItem : any;  ... } </code></pre>  <p>The problem is the this.selectedItem is undefined when I check it in another button event later on. I assume this is because the scope is different when the function gets called in the Kendo Grid, so 'this' means something else and not my controller class:</p>  <pre><code>handleNext() {  console.debug(this.selectedItem) //this is undefined here? } </code></pre>  <p>So my question is how do I assign this result to my controller class so I can access it later on?</p>
