<p>Here is the scenario I'm trying to achieve with the Kendo UI grid:</p>  <ol> <li>Retrieve some persisted data via jquery, restangular, or whatever.</li> <li>Bind the grid to the data.</li> <li>Edit the data in the grid.</li> <li>Add a new row to the grid.</li> <li>Click some "Save" button and send the updated data back to the server.</li> </ol>  <p>Based on what I've read, when using the Kendo UI grid you have to wrap the array you supply for the data source in order for the grid to update the original model.  The grid's built-in commands, however, don't seem to operate correctly when you do this.  As shown in the following example, upon clicking 'Edit' on a row, you can't then click 'Update' or 'Cancel'.  It just gets stuck.  If you don't wrap it with an array, the existing records are updated fine, but then you don't get new records added to the origin array.</p>  <p><a href="http://dojo.telerik.com/aTIba" rel="nofollow">http://dojo.telerik.com/aTIba</a></p>  <p>The faulty behavior seems to have something to do with the fact that a uid is placed on the records by wrapping them with an ObservableArray.  Oddly, passing in an empty array (as you might do for an Add vs and Edit dialog), the buttons work correctly and the underlying datasource is modified.</p>  <p>So, what's wrong with this configuration?</p>  <p><strong>Update</strong></p>  <p>The original example displayed the id field as one of the columns which was proving to be a distraction from the real issue for several people I've received feedback from, so I've removed it.  I also add the ability to add a new row and added output to see the contents of the original data source.</p>
