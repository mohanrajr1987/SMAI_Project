<p>i am very new to posting questions so i apologize for any mistakes i make.</p>  <p>Anyway, i was wondering if there is a way to make it so that when data is added to a cell in a kendo grid it is hidden until the user clicks a span that says "view more". additionally if there is nothing in the cell i do not want "view more" to appear.</p>  <p>Currently i have a page containing two kendo grids in a tab strip and a function that applies formatting after the table is filled in but i am running into a problem where formatting will be applied correctly on the first grid that loads only to be reapplied incorrectly(inserts additional View more) after the second grid loads. </p>
