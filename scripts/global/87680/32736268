<p>I have my data coming inside a data variable "data" which contains the array of all the data that I want to feed to Multi Select. I know there is a thing called schema which specifies he field in json which contains the data. I have already tried</p>  <p>.Schema(schema => schema.Data((object data) => { return data; }))</p>  <p>and also tried without the helper. Can somebody please tell the syntax for defining the schema with the helper. This is the error I get</p>  <p>Kendo is not defined</p>  <p>I know this is same question as <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29832460/how-do-you-set-the-data-function-for-a-kendo-datasource-using-the-razor-html-hel">How do you set the data function for a Kendo DataSource using the Razor HTML Helpers?</a></p>  <p>but that question is also still unanswered</p>
