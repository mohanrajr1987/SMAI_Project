<p>I have a bound column that can be either a % or a $ I know how to format for one or the other. My question is how do I format a column based on what the user selects?</p>  <pre><code>columns.Bound(p =&gt; p.Rate) .Title(FieldTranslation.GetLabel("Rate", GlobalVariables.LanguageID)) .HeaderHtmlAttributes(new       { title = FieldTranslation.GetLabel("Rate", GlobalVariables.LanguageID)       }); </code></pre>  <p>That is my column. I have tried to use a script and nothing happens. I'm either doing it wrong or that will not work.</p>  <p>Any help is appreciated.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
