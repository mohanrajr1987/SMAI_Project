<p>We have selections persisting, maybe just a bit too much. :D</p>  <p>For example, if you have a multipage kendo grid with client side data, do this with a client side kendo grid:</p>  <ul> <li><p>Select a row on Page 1</p></li> <li><p>Go to Page 2</p></li> <li><p>Select a row on Page 2 THEN deselect it and select another row</p></li> <li><p>Go back to Page 1 (row selection persists)</p></li> <li><p>Go back to Page 2</p></li> </ul>  <p>Row selection persists, but also the row that was previously deselected is also selected.</p>  <p>Is there a solution to this? Something we can use in the change event:</p>  <p><a href="http://dojo.telerik.com/@crunchfactory/uhEZe" rel="nofollow">http://dojo.telerik.com/@crunchfactory/uhEZe/7</a></p>  <p>Thank you,</p>  <p>j</p>
