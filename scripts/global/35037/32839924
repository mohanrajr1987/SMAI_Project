<p>Recently I was trying to setup a development cluster on my local machine in ArangoDB.</p>  <p>I tried to create a cluster through the web interface, I got this error stating:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>"<strong>Error while starting the cluster: Unauthorized</strong>".</p> </blockquote>  <p>The first time I tried doing it, it doesn't show any error, but kept asking for username and password again and again, and shows:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><strong>Coordinator User invalid</strong>.</p> </blockquote>  <p>My ArangoDB version is <strong>2.6.8</strong></p>  <p>Where have I gone wrong?</p>
