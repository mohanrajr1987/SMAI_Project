<p>We are using RavenDb as our NoSql datastore. We will store a huge amount of data that needs high performance on the queries.</p>  <p>Our current relational model is translated to a document structure, i will use non relevant Class names because i cannot disclose the real business case:</p>  <ul> <li>Company</li> </ul>  <p>Has it's own properties and contains a list of stores (around 50)</p>  <ul> <li>Store</li> </ul>  <p>Has it's own properties and contains a list of Product (around 150)</p>  <ul> <li>Product</li> </ul>  <p>Has it's own properties</p>  <p>We have stored this as Json:</p>  <pre><code>{   "Id": 1,   "CompanyName": "first company",   "Location": "Not so far",   "Stores": [       {         "Id": 125,         "CompanyId": 1,         "StoreName": "sweets",         "Products": [             {               "Id": 1289,               "StoreId": 125,               "Name": "Candy",               "Price" : 10             }         ]       }     ] } </code></pre>  <p>We want to expose each sublist of the document with an OData service.</p>  <p>We added an index map to the selected level but then we got a RavenDb error that we are only allowed 15 mapped outputs per document.</p>  <p>We could alternatively store the lowest level (Product) and duplicate all Store and Company data. But this seems a bad design.</p>
