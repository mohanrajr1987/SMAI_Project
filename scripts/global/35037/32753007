<p>So I'm still learning how to access relationship parameters, I've found several ways to access different aspects of what I'm looking for but can't seem to piece it together.</p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21092163/neo4j-cypher-how-to-find-all-nodes-that-have-a-relationship-to-list-of-nodes">neo4j cypher - how to find all nodes that have a relationship to list of nodes</a></p>  <p>I am getting closer, but can't figure out how to sum a collection and check for length.</p>  <pre><code>MATCH (album:Album)-[r]-&gt;(tags:Word) WHERE tags.name IN ['alpha', 'bravo'] WITH album, COLLECT(tags) as tags, COLLECT(r.weight) as weight RETURN album, tags, weight </code></pre>  <p>Thank you in advance.</p>
