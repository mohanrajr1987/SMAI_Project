<p>I went through all the resources (almost) on google and I dont get something.</p>  <p>Let's imagine I have a lot of data to store. I use Hadoop and his native HD File System BUT I also want to get real-time informations, so I need NoSQL. Where do my database gonna be install ? On the datanode itself ? On the namenode ? Both ?</p>  <p>Let's imagine (once again) that I have data coming in my system, the namenode gonna cut it into several pieces and replicate them on different datanode. With NoSQL, will it work the same way ? Does HDFS take a part in this process ?</p>  <p>The metadatas stored in the NameNode give the adress, so how is it questionned ? </p>  <p>I think I understand the concept of Hadoop and HBase basically but I misunderstand when I go further..</p>
