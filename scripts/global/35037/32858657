<p>I am trying to write the index and search using date and time in that index in Cloudant NoSql database.  When I pass only the date in the query string, it works fine</p>  <pre><code>created_date:[2015-08-16 TO 2015-08-27] </code></pre>  <p>This returns the correct results but when I include time in the parameter:</p>  <pre><code>created_date:[2015-08-16 07:38:00 TO 2015-08-27 07:38:02] </code></pre>  <p>I get an error:</p>  <pre><code>Cannot parse 'created_date:[2015-08-16 07:38:00 TO 2015-08-27 07:38:02]': Encountered " "TO" "TO "" at line 1, column 50. Was expecting one of: "]" ... "}" </code></pre>  <p>I have some more query parameters before this but the above is the gist of the error.</p>  <p>This is an Apache Lucene query string. What is causing this to happen?</p>
