<p>I have been doing some research on data mining algorithms and now I would like to do some tests to verify my conception. The purpose of the experiment is to gather some data in "slave" nodes, process it and then send the data to a central node which would merge data from all nodes. The central node would process data again and send results to the "slave" nodes (different for each node). I have already implemented the algorithms which will be used for processing and now I am looking for a software (DB, framework etc) which suits my needs.</p>  <p>I would be grateful for any help.</p>
