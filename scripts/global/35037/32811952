<p>I'm building a crowdsourcing platform with the goal of increasing creativity of writers. The platform is suppose to store texts and images in the form of cards. I've been trying to decide what's the best database to use (relational or noSql). After my search i've found out that noSql databases might be the way to go, but i'm still not sure what to do here. As it looks noSql provides best support for large quantities of simultaneous request, but i'm not sure if that's true. Can you give me any oppinions on what to do?</p>
