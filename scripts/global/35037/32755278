<p>We are in process of deciding of Technology stack for an E-commerce based solution. </p>  <p>There will be different modules like </p>  <ul> <li>Catalogs</li> <li>Order management</li> <li>Shopping cart</li> <li>Inventory computation</li> <li>Analytical Reports for Admin</li> <li>Full Text Search</li> </ul>  <p>Obviously, choosing a single NoSQL product for above modules will not be a perfect choice given their own read/write/update operations and requirement of ACID property.</p>  <p>What would be the ideal choice of NoSQL product for each of the different modules considering the use case of modules matches with NoSQL product features/specialty.</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
