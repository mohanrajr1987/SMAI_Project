<p>I have an index where each documents has 4 integer fields and about 400 double fields. Here's what a sample 'put' looks like:</p>  <pre><code>curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/my_index/products/2' -d '{     "id" : "2",     "category" : 1,     "price" : 200.5,      "prop_0": 0.05,     "prop_1": 0.08,     .     .     .     "prop_400": 0.08, }' </code></pre>  <p>I have about 0.3 million products. All the fields are indexed. However, when I run a basic query to get products from a given category, the response time is over 100ms. This seems to be quite strange</p>  <pre><code>curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/my_index/products/_search?pretty=true' -d '{  "filter" : {     "bool" : {         "must" : {             "term" : { "category" : "1" }         }     } } }' </code></pre>
