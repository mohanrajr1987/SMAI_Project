<p>I am working with AWS Lambda/DynamoDb  in Java and want to store an HTML template to the dynamo db for mailing purpose. My problem statement :  I have to use a HTML template to send mails to end users.</p>  <p><strong>Solution i implemented:</strong> </p>  <p><strong>Solution 1 :</strong>  Store the template in s3 download the template, change the place holders and mail it. issue with solution -> When i test this in my local system, everything works fine but after i upload this to lamda and then execute the function then it doesn't work. </p>  <p>I get the following error message:-</p>  <pre><code>java.io.FileNotFoundException: 1.html (Permission denied) java.io.FileNotFoundException: 1.html (Permission denied) </code></pre>  <p><strong>My code is -</strong> </p>  <pre><code> String bucketName = "abc";         String key = "xyz/1.html";         String fileName = "1.html";          ObjectMetadata s3object = s3Client.getObject(new GetObjectRequest(                 bucketName, key), new File(fileName)); </code></pre>  <p>The catch is that this exact script works in my local machine so i am sure that the key and the bucketname matches to the correct file.</p>  <p><strong>Solution 2 :</strong>  Store the html template in Dynamodb and when needed replace the place holders and then send the mail.  The issue that as Dynamo db is a key value db so double quotes are not allowed. So i need to escape them. I can save the template by escaping the template's double quotes but then what about the time when i need to take them back from the db and then remove all the escape sequences again. ? Is this a correct process, if yes then how to achieve this ?</p>  <p>so my questions are : </p>  <ol> <li>how to implement solution 1.</li> <li>Is there any api or some other way to first escape and then remove the escapes in HTML template ? </li> <li>Is there some better way to solve my problem case.</li> </ol>
