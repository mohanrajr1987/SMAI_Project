<p>We are planning the next project and thinking about to store transactions into a NoSQL Database. Basically it is an application where the user can collect some points (like payback) and later pay with points.</p>  <p>The main idea was to store the transactions itself into the noSQL Database and mysql server only stores the current balance.</p>  <p>So my question is this a good approach to handle that or should I just use a mysql database?</p>  <p>The problem why I was thinking about using noSQL is, that we assume there are a lot of queries in a short time.</p>
