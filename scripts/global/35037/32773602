<p>I need to list on my blog homepage one quite recent comment, the top author and 10 last articles (resume and authors list).</p>  <p>I think, instead of make multiple request in mongo database to get all the documents, I can just have a document containing all that data. Something like that :</p>  <pre><code>{     topAuthor: "",     lastArticles: [{resume: "", authors: ["", ""]}...],     lastComment: { user:"", content:"" } } </code></pre>  <p>I can update this document each time somebody post an article or when a user post a new comment if last comment is here since at least 1 hour. So there is no update intensive.</p>  <p>But the problem is that I only need one document like that. So, is it stupid to create a collection with just 1 document store inside ?</p>  <p>And sorry for my bad english, I'm french.<br> Thanks.</p>
