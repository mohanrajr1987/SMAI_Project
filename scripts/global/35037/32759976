<p>I'm using <strong>parse.com</strong> with a <em>cordova</em> based mobile app and I ran into an issue dealing with a list page that has different type of items. For the sake of the example, imgine three types of items- <strong>text, image and event</strong>. </p>  <p>My solution for this problem was to create three different types of parse classes: <code>Image</code>, <code>Text</code> and <code>Event</code>, Each with it's own special fields, and a <code>Message</code> class that has a <em>pointer</em> <em>data</em> field from type <code>Parse.Object</code> that will contain anyone of the three type of classes.</p>  <p>The problem is I'm not compleley sure on how to make the <em>data</em> field point to an <code>Parse.Object</code>. There's no option for this in <em>Data Browser</em> and, as I understand, in the <em>JS SDK</em> this happens autoamtically the first time you set a value from some type for the field. (e.g If I save <code>Image</code> on <em>data</em>, it'll lock me to use only <code>Image</code> from here on out).</p>  <p>Would love to hear if anyone know how to achive this or, if enyone has different idea for making a list with differetn types of items.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
