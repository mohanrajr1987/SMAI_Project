<p>Right now I am working on creating a web service with the following requirements:</p>  <ol> <li>Accept a JSON document</li> <li>Take a look at the JSON document (I.e. code interpreting the JSON, though can initially be a no-op)</li> <li>Store the JSON document, say, in a NoSQL database.</li> <li>Return a JSON response</li> </ol>  <p>The client will know the required format of the JSON document, so I do not need to expose that information.</p>  <p>I have Linux servers (Ubuntu 14.04 LTS) for hosting the web services. What is the terminology in this area? My background is in Windows application development, so my knowledge how Linux servers work is very limited.</p>  <p>When trying to search for JSON and web services both on stackoverflow and google I get many old answer. Particularly from google where many results are from before 2009. I have found Docker which is a very interesting prospect. I have not found how to write a program for Docker which accepts JSON inputs. For a NoSQL database my current findings is MongoDB since it supports storing JSON documents. Even with this I feel like I ask the wrong questions.</p>  <p>How can I glue these together? What development environments can I use? Most importantly: How can I search for the information I need? What keywords do you typically use in this area?</p>  <p>Thank you for any hints and answers</p>
