<p>I'm starting a new project (a survey application) and I chose RethinkDB as my database; however, I have some questions about data modelling. I'm going to have questions that can be answered only once by each user. Moreover I'll have reports that will tell the percentage of users that chose each option. At first I thought of the following modelling: </p>  <p><code>{   title: String,   total_answers: Number,   options: [{     value: Number,     label: String,     respondents: [User IDs]   }] } </code></p>  <p>The problem is that RethinkDB suggests embedding only a few hundred items on an Array and I'll probably have 500+ respondents per survey.  The other option is to create an <code>answers</code> table and link to the question id and option but reports queries may be a problem as I'll have many questions per survey.</p>  <p>Which path should I follow?  Thanks!</p>
