<p>I am removing the first character of the string and I am using substr(); function for that. <br> For example : <br></p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php $amount =  'â‚¬300'; echo substr($amount ,1); ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>This code is doing its work fine but it have some bug. When I display the substr() function applied string then it display something other symbol at the beginning of the string. Below image has output.<a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/DNZdN.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/DNZdN.png" alt="enter image description here"></a> </p>  <p>In above image you can see its displaying unwanted symbol. But when I apply substr() function again it works successfull. <br> I just want to know why this function having that symbol? what does this symbol mean? Why its coming in the output? </p>
