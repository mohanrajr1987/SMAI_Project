<p>The problem is that in my code (which there is a loop getting alphabets of a string) it can not save the current string input into another variable:</p>  <p>Here is the code:</p>  <pre><code>if(isalpha(Str[i])){          while (isalpha(Str[i])){             i++;         }         Str.erase( 0, i);         return 0;     } </code></pre>  <p>I want to have another string (like <em>temp</em> ) to save each alphabet into the while loop. something like this:</p>  <pre><code>if(isalpha(Str[i])){         string temp;         while (isalpha(Str[i])){             temp[i]=Str[i];             i++;         }         Str.erase( 0, i);         return 0;     } </code></pre>  <p>can anyone help that what is the problem here?</p>
