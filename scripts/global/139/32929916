<p>I am trying to convert long numbers to a string vector in rust. Example <code>17562</code> would become <code>["1", "7", "5", "6", "2"]</code>. I have seen a lot of converting ints to strings, but no ints to string vectors.</p>  <p>Here is what I have so far, but it isn't working. </p>  <p><code>let values: Vec&lt;&amp;str&gt; = x.to_string().split(|c: char| c.is_alphabetic()).collect();</code></p>  <p>Later on in the code I am parsing that string back to a u8.</p>
