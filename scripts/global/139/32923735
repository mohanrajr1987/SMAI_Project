<p>I'm using a for loop as a form of validation check to make sure the input for the variable stScore is a number over 0 and under or equal to 100, example shown here, if the input isn't correct, the score parameter will be shown as 0:</p>  <pre><code>for(int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++)     if ((stScore[i] &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; stScore[i] &lt;= 100))         score[i] = stScore[i];     else         score[i] = 0; </code></pre>  <p>My question is if there is any way to display a string (to say something like error!) in place of that 0 instead? Of course at the base of things you can't have an int array include a string, but I was wondering if there is a workaround for this. Thanks</p>
