<p>I'm trying to extract data from a text file in bash so I can know what's the Uid on the status file in a proc folder. The excercise consists of printing all the processes' Pid that have their Uid different from 0 0 0 0 The Uid is in the 8th line and I'd like to take the numbers the line show but dont know how. Is there anyway to take off characters from a specific line and from a specific column? In this case, i'd just like to save the numbers to have a new string so I can compare it with the one I created at the beginning, which only has 0's. Then I just have to compare them and if they are different, I should print the process' Pid. It should be like this:</p>  <pre><code>  New_String:0   4   5   1  #example   Old_string:0   0   0   0  #the one I created to be compared </code></pre>
