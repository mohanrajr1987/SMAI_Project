<p>I have a bit tricky question. E.g. I have a start_date: 15/01/2015 and an end date: 17/03/2015 for given record and I would like to generalize that to know,  if the record with those exact start and end date belongs to January (by my definition even if it is 31/01/2015, then it belongs to January).</p>  <p>I did the following:</p>  <pre><code>sum(case when to_date('2015/01/01','yyyy/mm/dd') between ROUND(dtime_method_start,'MONTH') and ROUND(dtime_method_end,'MONTH') then 1 else 0 end) as flag_jan </code></pre>  <p>But the problem with Round function is, that it takes everything from 16-31 as next month, which is no good for me. How can I fix it or rewrite it to make it comply with my definition?</p>  <p>I want to know if a record with certain dtime_method_start and dtime_method_end belongs to January. I have many records with many different start and end dates and want to know how many of them belong to January.</p>
