<p>I have a Bash script which uses:</p>  <pre><code>THE_DATE=`date +"%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S"` </code></pre>  <p>To get the current date and time in a format which can be used to <code>mkdir</code> new directory.</p>  <p>But, for report generation, I use something like:</p>  <pre><code>REPORT_DATE=`date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"` </code></pre>  <p>Which is the same, but different, if you see what I mean.</p>  <p>This means running <code>date</code> twice, and I understand that it's possible (although unlikely) for the seconds component to different between the two.</p>  <p>How, do I get the date in two different formats at the same time?</p>
