<p>I have a problem which seems to be very simple to solve but I can't. In my Fact table I have a Timestamp field which is a smalldatetime Type. This fact is linked to a Time dimension via its fulldate_Fk (also SmallDatetime). So What I would like to have is to compare the timestamp with the FullDate_FK from the fact to create a calculation like this:</p>  <pre><code>iif([Dim Time].[Date].CurrentMember.MemberValue &lt;=      [Fact].[Timestamp].CurrentMember.MemberValue    ,[measures].[YTD Actuals]      ,[measures].[YTD Actuals]+[measures].[YTD Com]) </code></pre>  <p>But it is not working at all. All [Dim Time].[Date] seem to be evaluated as &lt; than the Timestamp. P.S: The Timestamp is the last date when the data have been loaded in the DB (in my case 31/08)</p>  <p>Here the result I got:</p>  <pre><code> MONTH   |  YTD Actuals  |  YTD Com   |  Calculation;  JAN  ,        10      ,        10   ,        10;  FEB  ,        20      ,        10   ,        20;  MAR  ,        40      ,        20   ,        40;  MAY  ,        60      ,        30   ,        60;  JUN  ,        70      ,        50   ,        70;  JUL  ,        85      ,        50   ,        85;  AUG  ,       120      ,        55   ,       120;  SEP  ,       120      ,        60   ,       120;  OCT  ,       120      ,        70   ,       120;  NOV  ,       120      ,        80   ,       120;  DEC  ,       120      ,        90   ,       120; </code></pre>  <p>From August, I should have the sum of Actuals YTD and Com YTD in the calculation, but I still have the Actuals YTD only?</p>
