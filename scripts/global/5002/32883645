<p>In my table, I have a column that contains date in millisecond like this:</p>  <pre><code>table a        dateinmili       1440301846096 //first six month date        1443589721039 //second six month date </code></pre>  <p>I use that for my Android device and it works fine. When I want to use this time in a PROCEDURE in SQL Server and convert this time to human time (understandable for human) and date I have a problem.</p>  <p>I'm in Iran which uses UTC time in first six <strong>Persian date</strong> month 4.30 and 3.30 in second six month.</p>  <p>For convert date in PROCEDURE I use this code:</p>  <pre><code>CONVERT(nVARCHAR(10),DATEADD(mi, DATEDIFF(mi, GETUTCDATE(), GETDATE()), DATEADD(ss,dateinmili/1000,'1970-01-01')),8) as date  DATEADD(mi, DATEDIFF(mi, GETUTCDATE(), GETDATE()), DATEADD(ss,dateinmili/1000,'1970-01-01')) as time </code></pre>  <p><strong>and here is my problem:</strong></p>  <p>When I convert date in second six month and date registered in first six month of year, I get 1 hour difference between real time and converted time. I know that is because      </p>  <pre><code> DATEDIFF(mi, GETUTCDATE(), GETDATE())     </code></pre>  <p>method which return different between UTC time and local time when ever its called (in my example return 3:30 not 4:30 ) but I don't know how can I fix that?     </p>  <p>I can add column which contain current UTC time but I am looking for another way.</p>  <p><strong>update</strong>     </p>  <p>I see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14507649/convert-unix-epoch-timestamp-to-tsql-timestamp">this question</a> and it's not my problem convert long to date.<br> My problem is in my country UTC time is not constant in whole year and change between 3.30 and 4.30, for example I have date registered in first six month (Persian six month) like 1440271800000 and convert it now which we are in second six month (Persian six month) and use this code for convert.    </p>  <pre><code>declare @unixTS bigint set @unixTS = 1440271800000  select dateadd(ms, @unixTS%(3600*24*1000),      dateadd(day, @unixTS/(3600*24*1000), '1970-01-01 03:30:00.0') ) </code></pre>  <p>I get this    </p>  <pre><code> 2015-08-22 23:00:00.000      </code></pre>  <p>but it's not right date; the right date is:    </p>  <pre><code>2015-08-23 00:00:00.000 </code></pre>  <p>because when time registered UTC was 4.30 and not 3.30 but know when I convert  it UTC is 3.30.</p>  <p>I wish if there was a method in SQL which return past UTC time different; I mean put a date to that and return that time different between local time and gmt time my problem solved.</p>  <p>I hope you understand my problem.</p>
