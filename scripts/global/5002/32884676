<p>I have a <code>SELECT</code> statement that I am trying to convert from Netezza SQL to Impala SQL. The output looks something like <code>140612</code>, which is a date that is obtained by subtracting <code>7</code> from the current date and then pulling out the monday of that week. </p>  <p>I need to have this readable for Impala, then format it, then turn it into a string.</p>  <p>The query is :</p>  <pre><code>TO_CHAR(next_day(DATE(a.date)-7, 'Monday'), 'YYMMDD') AS START_DATE </code></pre>
