<p>I studied that Tomcat is a web server and a servlet container which ofcourse could not support the applications of full JEE i.e for example applications with EJB and so.</p>  <pre><code>   But I heard that Tomcat 8 has new features that support EJB applications also. I would like to know if it is true or not. Is it possible to deploy EJB applications in tomcat version 8?     If so, from which version of tomcat, are EJB applications being supported? And if tomcat also supports EJB applications then what advantages does JBoss (or WildFly) have over Tomcat versions that support EJB?     Could anyone please suggest with proper reply? Thanks in advance. </code></pre>
