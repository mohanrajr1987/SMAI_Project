<p>I'm trying to run an <a href="https://github.com/nazerke/wildflydevelopmentbycmilandmatloka" rel="nofollow">example</a> from "Java EE 7 Development with Wildfly". First I've deployed ticket-agency-ejb itself via <code>mvn wildfly:deploy</code>, but it didn't install the jar into local repo, so I did <code>mvn install</code> even though it isn't mentioned in the book.I can see the jar in the local repo as expected. But then I tried to run ticket-agency-ejb-client via <code>mvn package install exec:exec</code> but getting this error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Failed to execute goal on project ticket-agency-ejb-client: Could not   resolve dependencies for project   com.packtpub.wflydevelopment.chapter3:ticket-agency-ejb-client:jar:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT:   Failed to collect dependencies at   com.packtpub.wflydevelopment.chapter3:ticket-agency-ejb:jar:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT:   Failed to read artifact descriptor for   com.packtpub.wflydevelopment.chapter3:ticket-agency-ejb:jar:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT:   Could not find artifact   com.packtpub.wflydevelopment.chapter3:ticket-agency:pom:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT   -> [Help 1]</p> </blockquote>  <p>Then I did <code>mvn deploy</code> in parent project(ticket-agency) and tried to run the client again, it now works as intended. Now I'm confused</p>  <p>1) why <code>mvn wildfly:deploy</code> didn't put jar into local repo?</p>  <p>2) why deploying the parent was necessary?</p>
