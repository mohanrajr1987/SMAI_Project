<p>I'm trying to inject two EJBs of same type with different annotation. But the instances injected are same.</p>  <pre><code>@Path("/some") public class SomeResource {      @Inject     @SomePostConstructionAnnotationForSomeService("this")     private SomeService s1;      @Inject     @SomePostConstructionAnnotationForSomeService("that")     private SomeService s2; } </code></pre>  <p>SomeService class looks like this.</p>  <pre><code>public SomeService {      @PostConstruct     private void constructed() {         // find the annotation and do something else.     }      @Inject     private InjectionPoint injectionPoint; } </code></pre>  <p>The problem is that only <code>s1</code> is invoked and <code>s2</code> is equals <code>s1</code>.</p>
