<p>I am using Weblogic 12c Application Server for running our business application.  The application needs to integrate in real-time with an external system that provides Publish/Subscribe MOM API. </p>  <p>My approach is to have a Singleton bean, initiated at start up and after a few seconds calls a @Timeout method, which connects to the external system and gets into its infinite event loop as below.</p>  <pre><code>    while(true) {         event= externalSystem.nextEvent();    // This is a blocking call by the way         // process received event     } </code></pre>  <p>This works fine but after 600 seconds, Weblogic container throws the 600 seconds StuckThreadMaxTime exception because it assumes the thread is stuck in Running state where in fact it is blocked by design and should never finish.</p>  <p>Apart from implementing a full JCA adapter, what other options can I have in  making a blocking API call inside my session method without causing a timeout exception?</p>  <p>Please help!</p>  <p>Many Thanks, Salam</p>
