<p>I’ve tried CDI injection and @EJB injection of Stateless EJBs in a Rivr dialog. They don’t work. I’ve also tried JNDI lookup of the EJBs through the Global JNDI name but I get following error (note I am using java:global but I get this message):</p>  <p><em>A JNDI operation on a java:comp/env name cannot be completed because the current thread is not associated with a Java Enterprise Edition application component. This condition can occur when the JNDI client using the java:comp/env name does not occur on the thread of a server application request. Make sure that a Java EE application does not run JNDI operations on java:comp/env names within static code blocks or in threads created by that application. Such code does not necessarily run on the thread of a server application request and therefore is not supported by JNDI operations on java:comp/env names.</em></p>  <p>Is there anyway I can inject or locate CDI @Named or EJBs in a Rivr dialog?</p>  <p>thanks Ignacio</p>
