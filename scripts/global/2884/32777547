<p>I have installed Seam facet on my eclipse. The wizard prompted me to provide database info in order to be able to install seam facet. I configured DB to be HSQLDB, and found the appropriate jar in JBOSS (which I am using). </p>  <p>I have actually two questions.</p>  <ol> <li><p>For my web project, I'm using oracle DB. What are the consequences of mismatch between my web project DB and the DB I've configured in seam facet? I am working on maven web project with different modules (ear, core, web, web-ejb, etc.) and after doing this I haven't seen any changes. I was able to build my application, deploy it and it worked just fine. So did I make a mistake, and can I fix it somehow? I cannot uninstall seam facet anymore. </p></li> <li><p>Could you please explain to me what does seam facet do. I've had seam working via maven, so what is the benefit of facet? </p></li> </ol>
