<p>If Enterprise Java Beans implement business logic, then why some people say they are controllers in MVC pattern?</p>  <p>Model in MVC is responsible for business logic, accessing the database, etc. Services belong to model layer in MVC as well. So isn't it exactly what EJB do? I'd classify them to the model.</p>
