<p>I built a project using wildfly-9.0.1, the network topological graph is shown below:</p>  <pre><code>Client(public network) --&gt; load balancer (iptable redirecting) --&gt; EJB (private network) </code></pre>  <p>A long latency has been found in this case, then: </p>  <ol> <li>I tried to run a client in the same network with EJB server (private network), the problem gone; </li> <li>I tried to change the version of wildfly to 6.X and connect from public network, the latency gone either. (It shows the latency was not caused by network status.)</li> <li>I tried to use wildfly 7.x - 8.x, the lantency appears again. I was confused with the construction of wildfly (version over 7.0). Is there any solutions to avoid the lantency in jboss over version 8.x?</li> </ol>
