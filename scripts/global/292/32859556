<p>I have my app 1's login posted in an iframe in app2. So user goes to app2, logs in using app1 and then the user goes to app1 home page.</p>  <p>This flow works by setting the <code>window.top.location</code> and works fine in Chrome and Firefox. However in <code>IE</code>, after change in the location after login, the app redirects to the login page which is bizzare.</p>  <p>Have anyone faced similar issue and if so how can we solve this. </p>
