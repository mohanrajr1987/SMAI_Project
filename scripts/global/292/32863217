<p>I am working on websockets, i am using <a href="http://socketo.me/" rel="nofollow">Rachet</a>. Whenever a user tries to establish a connection, i need to authenticate. My backend uses laravel 5 for all http authentification.</p>  <p>My server code is like this :</p>  <pre><code>    public function onOpen(ConnectionInterface $conn, RequestInterface $request = null) {        if (null === $request) {             throw new \UnexpectedValueException('$request can not be null');        }        $cookie = $request-&gt;getCookie('laravel_session');  //do authentification with cookie if possible </code></pre>  <p>I tried to use laravel </p>  <pre><code>Auth::user() </code></pre>  <p>I got following error :</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Call to member function user() on null</p> </blockquote>  <p>Whenever i try to connect to websockets from browser, it will use ws protcol and rachets server, so laravel routes are never getting called. Is that the reason i am getting an error when i try to use <code>Auth::user()</code> ?</p>  <p>Can i use that cookie to verify if user is logged in? Is there any other solutions? What will be the security risks involved?</p>
