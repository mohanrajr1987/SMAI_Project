<p>Though this question has been asked thousand times but still I couldn't find an exact answer. We know sessions are more secure than cookies but sessions expire on browser exit which I want to prevent. Now from you guys I learned two ways to prevent session expire on browser exit and I got some confusion over both concepts.</p>  <ol> <li><p>Use <code>session.cookie_lifetime</code> so how to exactly use it. Is the code below enough to set session for lifetime except when user logs out. </p>  <p><code>session.cookie_lifetime</code></p>  <p><code>session_start()</code>  </p></li> <li>Using sessions in conjunction with cookies like facebook and many other websites do. Is this the same method as mentioned above or it's different from using <code>session.cookie_lifetime</code>. </li> </ol>
