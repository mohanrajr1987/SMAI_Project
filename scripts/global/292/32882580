<p>I'm using <strong>document.cookie</strong> to get the cookies of the current site and it works fine - to some degree. It outputs two of the cookies but there's four in total. The other two have a dot in front of the domain name and that might be why it doesn't output,</p>  <p>I've done some research, and apparently a dot in front of the cookies domain, means that it's avaliable on all subdomains, so why shouldn't you be able to output it?</p>  <ul> <li>Cookie 1: Domain <strong>example.com</strong></li> <li>Cookie 2: Domain <strong>example.com</strong></li> <li>Cookie 3: Domain <strong>.example.com</strong></li> <li>Cookie 4: Domain <strong>.example.com</strong></li> </ul>  <p>Is there any way to get coookie 3 and 4 through Javascript (or any other clientside way)?</p>
