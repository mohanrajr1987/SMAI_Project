<p>I do something like this:</p>  <p>JS:</p>  <pre><code>Cookies.set(post_id + '_' + user_ip, post_id + "_" + user_ip, { expires: 1 }); </code></pre>  <p>PHP:</p>  <pre><code>$cookie_str = $post_id.'_'.get_client_ip(); if (isset($_COOKIE[$cookie_str_]) ){     print_r('ok exist'); } </code></pre>  <p>But it doesn't work ... cookie exist I check in network in chrome developer tools. Is there some different between cookies in JS and PHP ? or I do some stupid mistake? IP is always that same ... console.log() form JS shows that same IP like PHP</p>  <p><b>ANSWER:</b></p>  <p>Ok I remove IP from cookie name and value and it start working: Cookie like : 54_23.23.211.2 was not visible by $_COOKIE[ ];</p>  <p>Now cookie is only a simple number of $post_id;</p>  <p>But why "54_23.23.211.2" doesn't work, I don't know... cookie like cookie = dots are not permitted ?</p>  <p>YES - <a href="http://harrybailey.com/2009/04/dots-arent-allowed-in-php-cookie-names/" rel="nofollow">http://harrybailey.com/2009/04/dots-arent-allowed-in-php-cookie-names/</a> </p>  <p><b>Dots are not permitted in PHP cookies</b> :)</p>
