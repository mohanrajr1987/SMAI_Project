<p>How can I set cookie for each tab of browser separately? I have application in MVC 5 with logging users. Problem: I logged e.g. in FireFox to app in first tab, then in second tab I logged as other user. After that I refresh first tab and I see information from second user. But I want to have two tab with two logged different users. How can I do that? Thanks. Here is part of code to set cookie:</p>  <pre><code> FormsAuthenticationTicket authTicket = new FormsAuthenticationTicket(1, model.UserName, DateTime.Now, DateTime.Now.AddMinutes(60), false, userData);                  string encTicket = FormsAuthentication.Encrypt(authTicket);                 HttpCookie faCookie = new HttpCookie(FormsAuthentication.FormsCookieName, encTicket);                 Response.Cookies.Add(faCookie); </code></pre>
