<p>I have a website which won't let me navigate past the first page unless I have cookies enabled. I have tried this in Safari and it works with fine without javascript but as soon as I turn off cookies it returns to the first page.</p>  <p>My requests are simple post and get requests made like so</p>  <pre><code>[request setTimeoutInterval: 15]; [request setHTTPMethod:@"GET"]; [request setValue:_userAgent forHTTPHeaderField:@"User-Agent"]; [request setValue:_ref forHTTPHeaderField:@"Referer"]; _originalRequest = request; _currentSearch = 1; _urlConnection = [[NSURLConnection alloc] initWithRequest:request delegate:self];     [_urlConnection start]; </code></pre>  <p>I have tried calling the following to check for cookies</p>  <pre><code>NSLog(@"Cookies: %@",[[NSHTTPCookieStorage sharedHTTPCookieStorage] cookiesForURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://www.mywebsite.com"]]); </code></pre>  <p>But I get an empty dictionary</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Cookies: ()</p> </blockquote>  <p>How can I allow my application to use cookies? </p>  <p>Are cookies handeld differently when developing my application and running from xcode?</p>  <p>I am developing and application for OSX.</p>
