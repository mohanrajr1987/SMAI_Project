<p>I'm in the process of creating a JavaScript app for people to embed on their sites that I would like to have retain its login state between each embedding site.</p>  <p>The script itself runs in the context of the whole page and is not hosted in an iframe.  Despite that, I will need the login state of users using the functionality across domains to have their session travel with them.</p>  <p>My main site issues an <code>http_only</code> cookie.</p>  <p>The only technique I've been able to determine at this point is to have a proxy iframe running a script hosted on the domain the <code>http_only</code> cookie is issued for and proxy calls through it via <code>postMessage</code> from the scripts running on embedding sites.</p>  <p>This appears to be a technique that has been in use for quite some while.  Have there been any new developments or improvements to allow for similar scenarios without compromising the user's token?</p>  <hr>  <p>For the over-zealous moderators: The answer to this question could be as simple as a single sentence like "The proxy script technique is still your best option."  or "Try using [technique I don't know about] which has some interesting documentation/blog post/examples here."</p>
