<p>I am trying to know what is the name of the Amazon Affiliate cookie that is loaded in your browser once you click on an affiliate link.</p>  <p>I am working with Amazon.es and I have 3 possible options:</p>  <ul> <li>session-token</li> <li>ubic-acbes</li> <li>x-wl-uid</li> </ul>  <p>The content of each of these cookies varies and it is somehow encrypted I guess. Is there a way to know the ID related with the cookie that is loaded?</p>
