<p>How do I get the set-cookie header from a webpage?</p>  <p>I tried using below code:</p>  <pre><code>        var req = new XMLHttpRequest();         req.open('GET', document.location, false);         req.send(null);         var headers = req.getAllResponseHeaders().toLowerCase();         alert(headers); </code></pre>  <p>But this does not give the set-cookie header. </p>  <p>So how do I get it?( I actually can see the set-cookie value in browser's inspect element network tab).</p>  <p>If its not possible to get the set-cookie, then is there a way I could set something via server end that will allow me to get that value?</p>
