<p>I have an OAuth2 server and client. I want to keep the token life short (15 minutes) for security reasons. So what the client does is before requesting, it checks if the token is expired and refreshes it then does the request. It's pretty seamless. The user doesn't see any of this. My problem now is I can't implement ajax page loading because the cookies which saves the access token isn't refreshed without a page refresh. Is there a way around this? One thing I'm doing now is have some actions (saving) use page refresh while others don't.</p>
