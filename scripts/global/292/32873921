<p>I'm trying to delete WIF STS token cookie on server side, but could not get it to delete. It works only on the client browser side not on the server. I have been searching the web for the last few days but have not found a solution.   </p>  <p><strong>Some of the things i found and tried with no luck are:</strong> FederatedAuthentication.SessionAuthenticationModule.SignOut();              -FederatedAuthentication.SessionAuthenticationModule.DeleteSessionTokenCookie();           FederatedAuthentication.SessionAuthenticationModule.CookieHandler.Delete();</p>  <p>var test = HttpContext.Current.ApplicationInstance.Modules.Get("WSFederationAuthenticationModule") as Microsoft.IdentityModel.Web.WSFederationAuthenticationModule; test.SignOut(true); //throws a null error</p>  <p>The above lines of code get called in my STS web handling the logout. If anyone has any suggestion i would greatly appreciate it. Thanks</p>
