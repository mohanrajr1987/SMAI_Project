<p>I am implementing a SPA wherein I have a html element that calls an angularjs controller.</p>  <p>Here is my requirement:</p>  <p>I wish to check in the controller whether there is a specific cookie available:      - if yes, then call a service      - if not, then return a modal (with some questions that I wish to store in cookies when the user clicks "save" in modal)</p>  <p>Till now I am able to check the cookie in the controller but I am not able to show a modal to the user. </p>  <p>I have already created a html template (partials/question.html) which is using twitter bootstrap modal, but I am not able to return this modal (html) back to the user.</p>  <p>I tried modal service of angularjs but I hit the bottom of it as I am not able to create the same html template using the same (it works but its not as a cool ui).</p>  <p>Any suggestion or code snippet that I use for reference would be a great help.</p>  <p>Thanks!
