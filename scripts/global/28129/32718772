<p>I try to submit my app to the app store, but I have a problem that I can not fix. I can't archive the project beacuse this error: "no matching provisioning profiles found". I create manually a provisioning profile in the member center, I download it and I double clicked to open in xcode.</p>  <p>The big problem is that in my build setting I can't select that. Xcode show me only a blank text area.</p>  <p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ktxkacv2phlz8g6/Schermata%202015-09-22%20alle%2015.42.26.png?dl=0" rel="nofollow">screen 1</a></p>  <p>in the preferences the provisioning profiles is show !</p>  <p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/hiuah4srvn06be2/Schermata%202015-09-22%20alle%2015.46.16.png?dl=0" rel="nofollow">screen 2</a></p>  <p>Thank in advance for the helps !</p>
