<p>I am using the Store Kit SKPaymentQueue to download 100 megabyte file to my app.  For some reason that I cannot seem to understand the download is interrupted when either applicationWillEnterForeground or applicationDidBecomeActive (can't tell which), but there is nothing in those AppDelegates.  I'm sure someone who has been doing this longer than me might have a hint as to what is happening? </p>  <p>The Store Observer is being called within my ViewController.  I have tried calling it from the App Delegate as it's own singleton class also, but the same problem seems to persist.  Downloads complete if the view does not change.  Downloads also silently complete if the user presses the home button and minimizes the app.  However that download will be interrupted if the user returns to the app before the download is completed.  Any ideas?</p>  <pre><code>- (void)applicationWillEnterForeground:(UIApplication *)application {     NSLog(@"willenterforeground"); }  - (void)applicationDidBecomeActive:(UIApplication *)application {     NSLog(@"didbecomeactive");     // Restart any tasks that were paused (or not yet started) while the application was inactive. If the application was previously in the background, optionally refresh the user interface. } </code></pre>
