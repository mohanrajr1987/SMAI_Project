<p>2 weeks ago I had version 1.0.0 in "pending developer release". I gave out promo codes and I had 39 left. I received great feedback and decided to completely take down version 1.0.0 from iTunes Connect. Then I uploaded new Xcode binary version 1.1. Today version 1.1 is in "pending developer release". Yet, I still have 39 promo codes with a new version. I thought I was supposed to get 100 promo codes because any unused promo codes get expired if they were not used?</p>  <p>Or does it mean those unused promo codes can now still get used but they'll be automatically updated to version 1.1?</p>
