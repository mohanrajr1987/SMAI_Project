<p>I'm a new developer, and I'm trying to promote my app using Google Adwords &amp; a few other tools. </p>  <p>We finally have a lot of good reviews (almost 5 stars) but I want to drop the in-app price as well as make a few other changes (like to the keywords). </p>  <p>BUT as soon as we do this all of our great reviews disappear so it's like we are starting from scratch. Is there any way around this? It is so frustrating! It's almost like Apple is working against us?...</p>  <p>Also, our app doesn't show up as high in the store results as we were hoping...but any change to the keywords also seems to drop our reviews back to zero. Am I missing something?</p>
