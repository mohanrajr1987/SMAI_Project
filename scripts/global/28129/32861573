<p>I have created a app long time ago on my iTunes account and now i would like transfer it on different iTunes account. After googling i found transfer app is available at under <strong>App information > Additional information > Transfer App</strong>  <a href="http://cl.ly/image/0S1s3B3J2Z1F" rel="nofollow">like here</a>  But i am unable to find Transfer app option on my account <a href="http://cl.ly/image/0S1s3B3J2Z1F" rel="nofollow">like here</a>. I have already read Criteria for Transferring an App. Please let me know what can i do.</p>
