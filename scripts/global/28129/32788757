<p>I am still in the process of upgrading my app for iOS 9. In the meantime, I have been closely monitering my current app on the AppStore and haven't noticed too many crashes or in general iOS 9 effecting my current app on the AppStore. Before the last release, I had updated all the links/server calls,etc in my app to https.</p>  <p>I was just wondering how come, the iOS 9 update hasn't been very bad on my app? The Facebook SDK still works (it is on pre-v4.6) and all web links seem to be working.</p>  <p>If someone could a put a thought in about why this, it'll be really helpful.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance! </p>
