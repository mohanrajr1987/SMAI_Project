<p>I can't upload a new build using Xcode7 or Application Loader. It gets stuck on "Verifying assest with Itunes Store", and after a couple of minutes i get the error "Client unable to connect to server (check UDP port and firewall) (15)".</p>  <p>I tried uploading a new build with the Xcode6.4, and it worked. Did they change some port? Any way to fix it? My Mac have the firewall disabled.</p>  <p>Yesterday somehow i could upload a build, i was messing around with the router and other things, but i'm not sure what did the trick.</p>
