<p>I currently have a problem publishing my app. Some days ago I upgraded to XCode 7, then I made some change in the code of the app. I tested it, then I successfully archived and uploaded to App Store. Then I opened MyApps panel, I started a New version for the app, but near "Build" label the blue "Plus" icon is not present as usual. I cannot going on submitting the app for review. This is not the first time I do a new version for this app, the only difference is the upgrade to XCode 7.0 Do anyone has some tips for this issue? I'm quite a newbie about XCode and iOS.. Thanks in advance</p>
