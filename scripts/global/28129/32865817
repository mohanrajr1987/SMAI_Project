<p>I have a question about the App Store Review Guidelines concerning publishing white label apps.</p>  <p>The situation is the following: my company developed an app that is targeted at specific companies where only the employees of the company have login credentials to access the app. What we plan on doing is having multiple versions of this app but each version customized for each company (with their logos and colors) and again only the employees of each company are able to log into their company's apps.</p>  <p>My question is: does this concept violate any of the Apple Review Guidelines? More specifically, are the following items of the Apple Review Guidelines a problem?</p>  <p>2.11 - Apps that duplicate Apps already in the App Store may be rejected, particularly if there are many of them, such as fart, burp, flashlight, and Kama Sutra Apps</p>  <p>2.20 - Developers "spamming" the App Store with many versions of similar Apps will be removed from the iOS Developer Program</p>  <p>What do they mean by "similar apps"? Does our app fall into this category if only the employees of each company are able to log into each app? Has anyone had any experiences with this?</p>  <p>Any help will be much appreciated</p>
