<p>First off, I've uploaded the build to AppStore using Xcode 7 beta and only after pressing the "Submit for review" it has shown me the following error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Invalid Toolchain. New apps and app updates must be built with the   public (GM) versions of Xcode 6 or later, and iOS 8 SDK or later.   Don't submit apps built with beta software.</p> </blockquote>  <p>So I've updated to recent 7.0.1 version, archived the build, uploaded it to App Store.</p>  <p>And guess what? It shows the same error.</p>  <p>Browsed the forum, tried opening the <code>plist file</code> of the archived build, but the  "BuildMachineOSBuild" line already contains "14F27" (that worked for other guys on the forum).</p>  <p>Apple forums are filled with cases of this error and nobody has a clue.</p>  <p>NB: The issue was <strong>solved</strong> by Apple about an hour ago. They reacted pretty fast.</p>
