To process your delivery, the following issues must be   corrected:</p>      <p>Invalid Swift Support - The SwiftSupport folder is missing. Rebuild   your app using the current public (GM) version of Xcode and resubmit   it.</p>      <p>Once these issues have been corrected, you can then redeliver the   corrected binary.</p>      <p>Regards,</p>      <p>The App Store team</p> </blockquote>  <p>I read the following thread oh stackoverflow (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28011095/invalid-binary-or-invalid-swift-support">Invalid Binary Or Invalid Swift Support</a> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26163856/invalid-swift-support-invalid-implementation-of-swift">Invalid Swift Support / invalid implementation of swift</a>) but I don't find any solution.</p>  <p>I Have a project that has multiple target and uses Cocoa pods.</p>  <p>This is a screenshot of the project navigator:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/7a0k6.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/7a0k6.png" alt="enter image description here"></a> </p>  <p>Ideas?</p>
