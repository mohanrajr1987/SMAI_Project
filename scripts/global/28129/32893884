<p>I would like to open Appstore if app is not installed on iPhone. E.g. I want to open facebook from my app. I'm doing it like that</p>  <pre><code>UIApplication *ourApplication = [UIApplication sharedApplication]; NSString *ourPath = @"fb://profile/1234"; NSURL *ourURL = [NSURL URLWithString:ourPath]; [ourApplication openURL:ourURL]; </code></pre>  <p>But if facebook app is not installed on device I get such error:</p>  <pre><code>LaunchServices: ERROR: There is no registered handler for URL scheme fb </code></pre>  <p>in such case I would like to take user to facebook app on AppStore. I know I can do it like that:</p>  <pre><code>NSString *stringURL = @"http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=294409923&amp;mt=8"; NSURL *url = [NSURL URLWithString:stringURL]; [[UIApplication sharedApplication] openURL:url]; </code></pre>  <p>but how I will know what is Facebook AppStore id?</p>
