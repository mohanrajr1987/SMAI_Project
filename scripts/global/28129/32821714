<p>I am a developer and i am making an app for my client.<br> I have indie developer account so During testing period i am using client's UDID to build ipa file so they can test on their iOS devices.  </p>  <p>Now client will distribute final ipa file into itunes connect.<br> so What are the different legal solutions for this?  </p>  <p>Assume that they have indie developer account too and client is non-technical so they dont want to mess with xcode or source code.  </p>  <p>and in future i will do the same for other clients too.</p>
