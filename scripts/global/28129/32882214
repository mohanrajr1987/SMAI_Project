<p>I've just had an In-App purchase approved and hit the App Store. To check the app, I've deleted my test copy and downloaded fresh from the App Store - but now I can't get the In-App purchase without paying for it. Is there a way around this? Sandbox user isn't working in the real App Store, and I don't want to make the In-App purchase free, even for a short while, during the first few days of update. Promo codes are available for the app, but not the IAP.</p>
