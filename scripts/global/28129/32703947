<p>I know it sounds like kind of the wrong workflow but we need to make that work. </p>  <ul> <li>We have external Beta-Testers actively testing Version 0.3 of our App. </li> <li>we have NO Version in the AppStore until now </li> <li>we Need to publish a Version to the AppStore for sale WITHOUT killing the Beta-testing for our testers on Version 0.3</li> </ul>  <p>Is it correct that if we publish Version 0.2 to the AppStore for sale and the review process will be Succesful, testing in 0.3 will not be disturbed and testers can keep on testing 0.3 as nothing happened?</p>  <p>Apple-docs at least state that ONLY earlier Versions of the App will be affected and will be removed (and therefore testing will stop on this Versions) </p>  <blockquote>   <p>When builds become unavailable</p>      <p>Before your app becomes Ready for Sale, the Prerelease pane lists all   builds for all prerelease versions you have uploaded. After the app   becomes Ready for Sale, some of the builds will be removed from the   pane:</p>  <pre><code>The build USED IN THE APP is removed from Prerelease, as are all other builds in the SAME PRERELEASE  version </code></pre>      <p>All builds in EARLIER prerelease versions are also removed from   Prerelease.</p> </blockquote>  <p>The for your help</p>
