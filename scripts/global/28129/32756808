<p>Let's assume following scenario:</p>  <ul> <li>we are providing web pages for our customers (say CMS).  </li> <li>customers themselves have mobile apps which they want to get promoted on phones accessing pages we generate for them (HTML5, JS). </li> <li>we want to avoid redundancy and thus we would like to use <em>only</em> apps IDs to retrieve apps' titles, descriptions, icons directly from app stores.</li> <li><strong>However, we do not want to implement any authentication/authorization logic since we assume all the data mentioned are publicly available.</strong></li> </ul>  <p>To sum up, "input" is a mobile app ID (targeted platform is known), and the "output" is app's title, description, icons gathered via JS/HTML.</p>
