<p>My current version is "Pending Developer Release". Promo codes will expire October 10th, the ones I've used. So the users who i've given the promo codes to gave me good feedback for app. I want to take down the current app from iTunes connect and upload a new build and get that build approved with App review. So if I get that same app approved would I get 100 new promo codes or would I still continue with the 39 codes I currently have left? </p>  <p>Also, do the current codes that people have now, automatically expire for the users who used it if I upload the new build and request promo codes and I'd have to give them new codes OR do the codes automatically update the app by itself if I updated the app and it's passed app review?</p>
