<p>I am trying to submit an App that only supports arm64, which was developed in Xcode 7.  However, having uploaded the binary to iTunes Connect, it shows the following error message when I try to Submit:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>You must upload screenshots for 3.5-inch and 4-inch Retina displays., Your binary indicates support for iPhone/iPod touch. You must provide an iPhone/iPod touch screenshot.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I changed the Requirements in the Info.plist files, as well as the Architectures and Valid Architectures.  Is there something I am missing?  I only want to support 4+ inch displays and I believe you cannot have armv7s without armv7, so I only stipulated arm64.</p>
