<p>The app was uploaded to itunes connect but when adding and selecting a build, the build has a warning sign. However, tapping on the warning sign doesn't show any info. Any idea what could be the cause for this issue? Re uploading will not change anything.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/UTu3K.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/UTu3K.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
