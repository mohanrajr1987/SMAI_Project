<blockquote>   <p>EDIT: why voting down a legal question, written correctly, for which I   do need a solution? Would somebody please raise it up again please?</p> </blockquote>  <p>I was developing an educational app <strong>which I was targeting specifically for iPad-1 devices</strong>, because I think schools can take advantage on these 'old' devices.</p>  <p>However I'm afraid that nowadays it is not possible to upload apps which support iPad-1 (which is stuck with iOS 5.1).</p>  <p>What happens when I try using Xcode 6.4 to submit, is one of the two:</p>  <ul> <li>If I include the standard architectures (both 32 and 64 bits), I'm getting an error saying that apps with 64-bits can't set their target to iOS 5.1.</li> <li>If I remove the 64-bits support, I'm getting an error saying that Apple do not allow apps without 64-bits binary.</li> </ul>  <p>I was trying to search the internet but didn't find much info. Any idea please?</p>  <p>EDIT</p>  <p>I was trying to use the standalone app loader but it didn't change anything because the validate is done by the remote server. For the second option above, I was getting this:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>ERROR ITMS-90086: "Missing 64-bit support. Beginning on February 1,   2015 new iOS apps submitted to the App Store must include 64-bit   support and be built with the iOS 8 SDK. Beginning June 1, 2015 app   updates will also need to follow the same requirements. To enable   64-bit in your project, we recommend using the default Xcode build   setting of “Standard architectures” to build a single binary with both   32-bit and 64-bit code."</p> </blockquote>
