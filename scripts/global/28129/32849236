<h2>Scenario:</h2>  <p>Our company wants to develop a mobile application.</p>  <p>Our customers use a web application, which for the most part is hosted at their own servers. </p>  <p>This mobile application will be shipped at the same time as our web application, to make sure that they are compatible with each other at all times without careful mainteanance.</p>  <p>Thus i have to ensure that mobile applications can be distributed in a versioned manner (which is not that easy on every platform).</p>  <h2>My question: Is it possible to build, host and distribute(install) mobile applications for windows phone, ios and android?</h2>  <h2>Research results so far:</h2>  <h3>1 VERSIONED INSTALL</h3>  <ul> <li>Windows phone : probably*</li> <li>IOS : probably*</li> <li>Android : yes*</li> </ul>  <h3>Notes:</h3>  <ul> <li>IOS: Possible from special app store (along the lines of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/enterprise/" rel="nofollow">this</a>)? Either they get build products from us and deploy it in their version of the store or we host it for them.</li> <li>WP: I <strong>GUESS</strong> similar option to ios?</li> <li>Android: Allow unsafe sources + install url. (see <a href="http://developer.android.com/distribute/tools/open-distribution.html" rel="nofollow">this</a>)</li> </ul>  <h3>2 BUILD:</h3>  <ul> <li>Windows phone : probably</li> <li>IOS : probably</li> <li>Android : probably</li> </ul>  <h3>Notes:</h3>  <ul> <li>I'm guessing here, since i didn't start a trial yet, but i suppose depending on platform i can execute a build and receive executables (exe, apk, whateveriosextensionis) which can then be distributed</li> </ul>  <h3>3 VERSIONED HOSTING</h3>  <ul> <li>Windows phone : yes*</li> <li>IOS : yes*</li> <li>Android : yes*</li> </ul>  <h3>Notes:</h3>  <ul> <li>WP: According to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13144069/in-house-deployment-of-windows-phone-8-applications">this</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/jj206943%28v=vs.105%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">this</a> - possible</li> <li>IOS: According to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/enterprise/" rel="nofollow">this</a> - possible</li> <li>Android: Host version at url of choice - should be simple enough? (like <a href="http://developer.android.com/distribute/tools/open-distribution.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> link indicates)</li> </ul>  <h3>Is my research on this topic correct? Does anyone have experience with the subject and would be kind enough to confirm? Right now my conclusion would be that it <em>looks like</em> it is possible for all 3 platforms.</h3>
