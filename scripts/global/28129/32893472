<p>A few quick questions.</p>  <p>We have an application that is "pending developer release" on itunesconnect. the app was never released.</p>  <ol> <li>If I click "Release this version" - how long will it actually take until the app will appear on the appstore?</li> </ol>  <p>We managed to fix some minor UI issues and would like to upload a new build <strong>before</strong> releasing this version that is pending release.</p>  <ol start="2"> <li>Can we submit the new build we have that is better than the version that is pending release ? </li> <li>What is the timeframe for approving the new build ? i mean, is it the same like the initial review ?</li> <li>in general, how long does it takes until an update is approved ?</li> </ol>  <p>Thanks !</p>
