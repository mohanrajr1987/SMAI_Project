<p>In one of my application I need to allow clients to deploy their own code to extend site functionality. I would like to go with appstore model, where client can add their functionality in the form of app.</p>  <p>I am not able to judge a best way to implement this, I am thinking if my app supports something like plain HTML &amp; JS that will reach to more users. Even if support only ASP.net MVC no problem with that.</p>  <p>Can you please guide me a way / reference to start implementing app store concept in the website.</p>  <p>Thank you, -nm</p>
