<p>As apple has changed the itunesconnect interface recently ,I am having problem with submitting the app for review which was previously rejected by Apple.I am unable to find the build which was submitted from Xcode successfully.so I can not submit the app for review again. Can anyone enlighten me in this regard.</p>
