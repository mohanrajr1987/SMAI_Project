<p>Sorry about the obviously stupid question, but has anyone able to find where the customer reviews section been moved to in newly revamped (in Sep 2015) iTunes connect UI.</p>  <p>On previous iteration of the interface, there was a 'reviews' tab when you select your app in iTunes connect. But it's not there anymore.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
