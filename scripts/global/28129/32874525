<p>I'm about to submit my iOS game for review but I noticed after adding my Game Center achievements to the current version under the Versions tab of iTunes Connect that the Achievement IDs listed there are different to the IDs I originally created under the Game Center tab. Instead of the ones that I created (eg: ach_01), it's listing 8-digit IDs under the Version tab.</p>  <p>I tested the game in sandbox using the ID's that I created under the Game Center tab and it all works... but I'm worried that once published, the release version will need to look for those 8-digit IDs instead.</p>  <p>Does anyone know the answer to this? Can I leave it as is or do I need to change the IDs in my scripts to use those 8-digit IDs?</p>  <p>Regards</p>
