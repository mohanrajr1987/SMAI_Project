<p>I am trying to set a new App Description in TestFlight (Apple) however it just ignores my input and I cannot save any changes. Any idea on how I can achieve this?</p>  <p>Also when it used to work you could only set this after all testers are notified. Is there a place I can amend the description before testers are notified without changing the version?</p>  <p>See screenshot below, note the disabled 'Save' button: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/LjZiV.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/LjZiV.png" alt="Save button disabled even through new text &#39;Test&#39; is added to text field "></a></p>
