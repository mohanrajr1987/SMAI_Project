<p>Is it possible to send extra data with an App Store link so that this data is passed along to the app after download? I'm wanting to create an invite only system, and right now I have two links: one for the App Store and one for the app with the invite code embedded. Right now users have to tap the first link in order to download the app, then they have to tap the second link in order to open the app with the invite code. Is there a way to combine the two into one link that will go to the App Store and pass along the invite code after they open the app when it finishes downloading?</p>  <p>Also, is there a way to do this with the Play Store as well?</p>
