<p>I archive a binary with Xcode 7, then I validate the binary and when I try to submit to the iOS Appstore, I get the following errors:</p>  <ul> <li><p>Could not make parent directory for: /Users/DEC/.itmstransporter/softwaresupport/bin/Frameworks/MZXMLMarshalling.framework/Resources/Info.plist</p></li> <li><p>Could not configure software support.</p></li> <li><p>An exception has occurred: /Users/DEC/.itmstransporter/softwaresupport/bin/Frameworks/MZXMLMarshalling.framework/Resources/Info.plist (No such file or directory)</p></li> <li><p>The session's status is FAILED and the error description is 'failed to open ssh session. (16)'</p></li> </ul>  <p>The app runs perfectly in the iOS simulator and on the iPhone 5(iOS 8.3) and it doest seems like there is an error in the code.</p>  <p>I also try the uploading with the application loader but the same happens.</p>  <p>I think it could be something about xcode 7 or ios 9 because i didnt have this problems before.</p>  <p>Thanks for your help.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/cDPCG.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/cDPCG.png" alt="screenshot of the errors"></a></p>
