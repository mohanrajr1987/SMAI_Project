<p>When I try it, compilation fails with this error: -bundle and -bitcode_bundle cannot be used together...</p>  <p>I get the error when I try to compile my iOS app with ENABLE_BITCODE=YES. I know that settings ENABLE_BITCODE=NO would work, but this also means that I cannot submit my app to the AppStore.</p>  <p>I wonder how anyone has been able to submit iOS9 apps to the AppStore when this issue pretty much makes it impossible for any decent app using CocoaPods.</p>
