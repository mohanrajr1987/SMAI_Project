<p>I uploaded my application to App Store yesterday. I was waiting for a long time as I couldn't find my binary file in Pre-Release option. I thought it may take some time. But on the sudden the UI of iTunes Connect has been changed today and there is no Build still in the app store. Still the status is Prepare for Submission. What am I supposed to do. Kindly suggest me guys. </p>
