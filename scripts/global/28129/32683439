<p>Is it possible to have an App reviewed by Apple and keep on Beta-Testing? </p>  <p>In the iTunes Connect Developer Guide it says: "When the app becomes "Ready for Sale" in the App Store, testing automatically stops on earlier builds, and you will be unable to view or test them."</p>  <p>But  what happens If we would  choose "Manual release" while submitting an App for App Store Review so the App-status after successful review will be "Pending Developer Release".</p>  <p>1) Is it correct that the status "Pending Developer Release" won't stop testing automatically and our Beta-Tester still can test with Testflight?</p>  <p>2) Is it correct, that if we press "Release now" while the app status is "Pending Developer Release" it changes to "Ready for Sale" and Beta-Testing will stop?</p>  <p>Thanx for your help </p>
