<p>I would like to know if putting the exact same build of my app in beta app release review process on ITunes Connect while it already is waiting for expedited review for release on the app store would cause any problem. Any personal experiences regarding this situation? I need to release my application quick and was thinking about having a backup beta version available in case the main application is not ready for the event it is intended to be used at. I don't want the review team to refuse my application because it has the same build as the beta version. Any input is appreciated. Thanks! </p>
