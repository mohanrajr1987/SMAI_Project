<p>Before I uploaded the Xcode binary to iTunes Connect, I could only use the following link for app store to my app store page for game.</p>  <p><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/id123456789" rel="nofollow">http://itunes.apple.com/app/id123456789</a></p>  <p>Now my app status is "pending developer release" and when I click on "view in app store" in iTunes Connect I now have another link...</p>  <p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/App-Name/id123456789?gs=2&amp;bh=3" rel="nofollow">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/App-Name/id123456789?gs=2&amp;bh=3</a></p>  <p>Which link do I use now, does it make a difference even?</p>
