<p>I want to do some program analysis project on C program. So far, I want to get one C program as the input for clang, and then I use LLVM to make some analysis.</p>  <p>I want to do some experiment on gnu unix utility. For example:  diff (<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/" rel="nofollow">https://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/</a>).</p>  <p>For example, when I want to do analysis on <code>src/diff.c</code>:</p>  <p>My command is: <code>clang -emit-llvm -O0 -c diff.c -o test.bc</code></p>  <p>However I will get the below error:</p>  <pre><code>./system.h:21:10: fatal error: 'config.h' file not found </code></pre>  <p>which seems that clang cannot find <code>config.h</code>.</p>  <p>So my question is how to parse single program in a GNU utility? Do I need to write a Makefile or where can I find something like config.h?</p>
