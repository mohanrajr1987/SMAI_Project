<p>I'm learning OpenGL and trying to make my code as portable as possible. For now I managed to compile a project on Ubuntu Linux 14.04, Windows 7 and MacOS. But I having some problems with FreeBSD (PC-BSD 10.2 if that matters). Here is a code example:</p>  <ul> <li><a href="https://github.com/afiskon/cpp-opengl-model-view-projection" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/afiskon/cpp-opengl-model-view-projection</a></li> </ul>  <p>After running <code>make</code> (see all build steps in README.md) clang complains that it can't find <code>&lt;GL/gl.h&gt;</code> which is used in <code>./glfw/include/GLFW/glfw3.h</code>. But <code>GL/gl.h</code> is present in /usr/local/include directory.</p>  <p>According to Google this is a well known issue. I tried to manualy edit <code>CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS</code> in <code>CMakeLists.txt</code>, modify environment varibales, etc. Nothing works.</p>  <p>Could you help me, please?</p>
