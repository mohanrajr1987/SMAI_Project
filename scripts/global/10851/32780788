<p><strong>Background:</strong> I have quite a few dynamic frameworks that are built with bitcode support. Because of a couple of other dependencies I am unable to support bitcode on my main application, and since I'm working on an iOS application, builds get rejected when I send them to iTunes Connect for distribution because they contain frameworks with bitcode in them. So regardless of the reasons why they are doing this, I need to remove bitcode from the frameworks in order to distrubute my application.</p>  <p><strong>Question:</strong>  Is there a way to convert bitcode binaries to native binaries via one of the llvm, clang or any other tool?</p>
