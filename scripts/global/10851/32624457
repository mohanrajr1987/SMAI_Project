<p>I wonder if currently there is support for clang static analysis with various flows checking. I mean there is a checker to check for zero division, but can clang find a flow which a divider can evaluate to zero ? simple example: in the bellow example i will get to 0. do I get warning here ?</p>  <pre><code>for(int i = 10; i&gt;=0; i--){    int a = div(i);    ... }  foo(int b){    return 100000 / b; } </code></pre>  <p>if not, is there a plan to support this ?</p>
