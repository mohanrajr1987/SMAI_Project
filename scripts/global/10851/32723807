<p>I have a custom <code>clang/llvm</code> installation which I build and compiled. This installation is used by another tool which I also need to compile. During compilation of this tool there was an error saying that <code>Version.inc</code> file is missing. I found <code>Version.inc.in</code> in the clang sources and now wonder if <code>Version.inc.in</code> and <code>Version.inc</code> are the same file (i.e. same contents). If it is then I can just copy <code>Version.inc.in</code> into the correct directory and rename it to <code>Version.inc</code>. Does anybody know if my assumption is correct? And if it isn't, then what do I need to do to convert <code>Version.inc.in</code> to <code>Version.inc</code>?</p>  <p>Any help is appreciated.</p>
