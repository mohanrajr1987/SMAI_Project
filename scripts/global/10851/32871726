<p>I'am developing an Android static library with Visual Studio 2015.</p>  <p>I'am using C++ Rest SDK (<a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/cpprestsdk.android/" rel="nofollow">https://www.nuget.org/packages/cpprestsdk.android/</a>). It works with Visual Studio 2015 RC but not with Visual Studio 2015.</p>  <p>The reason is that Visual Studio 2015 uses the compiler clang 3.6 and the SDK is compiled with clang 3.4.</p>  <p>Is there a way to use C++ Rest SDK with Visual Studio 2015? Is there a way to install clang 3.4 into Visual Studio 2015?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
