<p>I want to find simple loops in LLVM bytecode, and extract the basic  information of the loop.</p>  <p>For example:  </p>  <pre><code> for (i=0; i&lt;1000; i++)     sum += i; </code></pre>  <p>I want to extract the bound [0, 1000), the loop variable "i" and the  loop body (sum += i).<br> What should I do?</p>  <p>I read the LLVM API document, and find some useful classes like "Loop",  "LoopInfo".<br> But I do not know how to use them in detail.</p>  <p>Could you please give me some help? A detailed usage may be more helpful.</p>
