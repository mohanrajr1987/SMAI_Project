<p>I came across <a href="http://cocoa-dom.tumblr.com/post/56517731293/new-thing-i-do-in-code" rel="nofollow">this</a> interesting article about an obscure (to me, at least) Clang GCC extension.</p>  <p>They say that a block enclosed in parentheses returns a value, like...</p>  <pre><code>UIButton *button = ({      UIButton *button = [UIButton buttonWithType:UIButtonTypeCustom];   [button addTarget:self action:@selector(someSelector:)     forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchUpInside];    button; }); </code></pre>  <p>It's very hard to find documentation for this (there's very little on the net and on the Clang website).</p>  <p>Does anyone know if it safe to use? If not, why?</p>  <p>Also, does it cause retain cycles like Objective-C blocks?</p>
