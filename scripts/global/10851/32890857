<p>I am pretty new to LLVM. I need to do a transformation pass where before every basic block, I need to insert this instruction 'mov $0, r15'. Assume I know how to iterate across Basic Blocks, my struggle is inserting this assembly code.</p>  <p>Can anyone write some sample code? or point me to some examples?</p>
