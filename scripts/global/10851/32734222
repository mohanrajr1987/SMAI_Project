<p>I'm on Ubuntu 12.04 with gdb 7.4 and gcc-4.6 and gcc-4.8</p>  <p>When building this simple program </p>  <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;  int main(void) {     printf("hello world\n");     return 0; } </code></pre>  <p>with gcc-4.6 and then extracting debug-sections with <code>objdump -W</code> I see a section called <code>.debug_loc</code>. Not so with gcc-4.8 or later. Not luck either with clang-3.6 or later.</p>  <p>The version of gdb on my system (7.4) seems to require this section to be able to associate source and execution.</p>  <p>The same problem appears when using the thread-sanitizer with clang. It is not able to associate source-lines with callstacks.</p>  <p>Why is there no more debug_loc-section and/or why is gdb 7.4 incapable of handling binaries missing this section? (GDB 7.7 works fine on the same binary) Is there a way to fix this with compiler flags?</p>
