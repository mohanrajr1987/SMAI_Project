<p>I updated xcode to 7 today. After the update the project I am working on has the warning "overrides a member function but is not marked 'override'". Since our project set "treade warning as error" to true. I got lots of errors.</p>  <p>I double checked "Other Linker Flags" and pretty sure the flag "-Wsuggest-override" is not included.</p>  <p>Since it is a big project I prefer to suppress the warning instead add the keyword "override" everywhere.</p>  <p>Any suggestion for disabling the warning?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
