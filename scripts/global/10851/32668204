<p>I have a C++ function call, such as:</p>  <pre><code>hello(a-&gt;p, a-&gt;p, a-&gt;p); </code></pre>  <p>I need to get the <strong>SourceLocation</strong> for the <strong>end</strong> of the first argument, so I can insert some code there, to transform it in:</p>  <pre><code>hello(a-&gt;p1, a-&gt;p2, a-&gt;p3); </code></pre>  <p>So far I have a <em>clang::CallExpr</em> representing the call, I then iterate through all args, via <em>arg_begin()</em> iterator, however, when printing the <em>SourceRange</em> for each argument both begin and end point to the same location, the start of the argument.</p>  <p>How can I get the end location of the whole expression for each argument ? In the example above I would like to get column 11, instead of column 7.</p>  <p>I think I should use the <em>Lexer</em> instead, to get the location of the comma, but couldn't figure it out yet.</p>
