<p>I have a situation where I am fading out divs with a certain class when a button is clicked. For example, if someone were to click "Hide Red," I use jQuery to hide all of the divs with a class of "red." These divs float left and have a width of 33%. When the reds are hidden, the other divs with the class "blue" that fill in the space for the "red" divs that were just faded out. This is what I am wanting to happen, but I would like to have the remaining divs smoothly transition into the missing space instead of "jumping" in to fill the missing space. Is there a way to do this using jQuery?</p>  <p>Below is all I am doing to fade the div out:</p>  <p><strong>JAVASCRIPT</strong></p>  <pre><code>$(".hide_red").click(function(){   $(".red").fadeOut(); }) </code></pre>  <p>And here is how the boxes are formatted:</p>  <p><strong>CSS</strong></p>  <pre><code>.box {   float:left;   width: 33%;   height: 80px; } </code></pre>  <p><a href="http://codepen.io/georgiaboy02/pen/Yyqwjy" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is a link to an example.</p>
