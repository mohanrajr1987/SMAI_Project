<p>I'm having troubles with an open/close tab using jquery. The purpose is for the tab to be clicked to reveal a fullscreen image of a slider sitting below. Technically, the slider itself doesn't change, it just simply alters the marginTop of the panel positioned below it to reveal the fullscreen image of the slider. There is a test link live at: <a href="http://www.the3rdobject.com/test-site/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.the3rdobject.com/test-site/index.html</a> - the top tab works perfectly though it is performing a similar function, but cannot get the lower tab to return to it's original position. Any help would be greatly appreciated. </p>  <p>To start, simply click on the lower tab 'Show fullscreen image' - this opens up to reveal the slider below. Just need to get it to close. </p>  <p>Any jquery experts, please help! I'm a jquery newb and going out my mind!</p>
