<p>I am tyring to get a svg with a clip-path animated on hover event, using only svg.</p>  <p>I am successful triggering the animation with <code>begin="1s"</code> (<a href="http://codepen.io/i2c2/pen/jbVqRK" rel="nofollow">see codepen</a>) , but not on <code>begin="click"</code> or <code>begin="mouseover"</code></p>  <p>I am doing something wrong, what I wonder what. I have looked for that issue, but got no clue</p>  <p>thanks</p>
