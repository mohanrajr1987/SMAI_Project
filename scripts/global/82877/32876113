<p>When you land on a page I'd like the background image to be focused on the bottom of the image and then pan up to the top of the image and then go back down and continuously repeat. I have the following code:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;body&gt;     &lt;div id="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/body&gt;  body {     height: 100%;     background-image: url(http://smmcnyc.com/work/apf/wp2/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/front-img2.jpg);     background-repeat: no-repeat;     background-position: 50% 100%;     background-attachment: fixed; } #container {     height: 100vh; }  $(document).ready(function () {     $('body').animate({         'background-position-x': '50%',         'background-position-y': '0'     }, {         duration: 500,     }); });     </code></pre>  <p>Why isn't this working? How do I get the process to cycle up and down continuously? Can I even use this code since Firefox does not support "background-position-x" but jQuery does not support "background-position" with .animate()?</p>  <p>JSFiddle is here: <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/bqc8o2hn/2/" rel="nofollow">https://jsfiddle.net/bqc8o2hn/2/</a></p>
