<p>I want to add page animations to a website - so on every page load it would fade the whole page in gently. But I'm worried about two things: firstly, seo - I'm not sure if using js or css could potentially hide content from search engines. Secondly, I'm also worried that if the js fails for whatever reason, or the person's browser doesn't support css3 then the page won't display at all (if the content is set to opacity 0 or display:none)</p>  <p>Aside from the whole page load effect, I will also be looking to do some simple animations on other page elements when they're scrolled into view. </p>  <p>I've seen a few libraries such as <a href="https://github.com/daneden/animate.css" rel="nofollow">animate.css</a>, <a href="https://github.com/blivesta/animsition" rel="nofollow">Animsition</a> and <a href="http://greensock.com/tweenlite" rel="nofollow">Tween Lite</a> that Google recommends. But not sure which to go for. What is the preferred, best practice method for this? </p>  <p>Thanks for any help</p>
