<p>I am using a jquery animate with the html5 drag and drop and I wanted to make the same animation that google drive do.</p>  <p>I manage to do that :</p>  <pre><code>element.bind('drag', function(e) {       _.each(draggedFiles, function(id) { //draggedFiles is an array of id         id = 'fs-row-' + id;         var newRow = angular.element('body').find('div#'+ id); // Element being animated          newRow.animate({           width: 190,           height: 50,           top: e.originalEvent.pageY,           left: e.originalEvent.pageX,         }, 'medium', function() {            // When the animation is over the tag element are being removed from the DOM           _.each(draggedFiles, function(id) {             id = 'fs-row-' + id;             angular.element('body').find('div#'+ id).remove();           });         });       });     }); </code></pre>  <p>The animation is working fine and go to the mouse position. But if I move the mouse during the animation, the animate will not update the top and left on the fly but instead just continue to move to where I clicked instead of following the mouse.</p>  <p>The drag event allow my to know the position of the mouse in the window. Is it possible to trigger the animate again until it reach the mouse position ?</p>  <p>[edit] I am looking at the jQuery doc and found that I can use progress or step, but I can't find if its possible to update the top and left from those two event. Anyone know?</p>
