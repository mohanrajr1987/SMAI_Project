<p>So this question has been answered a few times and I've tried the solutions and while they work, sort of, it's not the way I would like. What I am trying to achieve is to have a container scroll its width when an arrow is hovered, pause and then repeat if it is still being hovered.</p>  <p>I currently have it working except that you have to move your mouse off the button and back on to get it to scroll again, and the animation seems to be adding up each time. If you hover for a split second, then again it will do the full animation twice, or, if you scroll the opposite direction it scrolls the distance of the total number of times the button has been hovered over. Is there a way to clear the cache or something? Or am I making this more complicated than it could be?</p>  <p>I have the working example in <a href="http://codepen.io/de-fine-art/pen/EVypmN" rel="nofollow">CodePen</a> and here is the relevant Javascript:</p>  <pre><code>$(function() { var $container = $('#marker-list'); var scrollLeft = 0; var scrollRight = 0;  function $menuScrollLeft() { scrollLeft = scrollLeft + $container.width(); $container.animate({   'scrollLeft': scrollLeft }, {   duration: 1400,   queue: false }, 'linear'); }  function $menuScrollRight() { scrollRight = scrollRight - $container.width(); $container.animate({   'scrollLeft': scrollRight }, {   duration: 1400,   queue: false }, 'linear'); }  function $scrollStop() { $container.stop(); }  $('#after').hover($menuScrollLeft, $scrollStop); $('#before').hover($menuScrollRight, $scrollStop);  }); </code></pre>  <p>I have already tried simply completing the .animate with a callback to itself like this:</p>  <pre><code>function $menuScrollLeft() {     $container.animate({         'scrollLeft': $container.width();     },{duration: 1400, queue: false}, 'linear', $menuScrollLeft); } </code></pre>  <p>But that didn't work, it would scroll once and stop and then not work after that. The only other option I've tried was to make scrollLeft a huge number like 100000 with a duration of 60000 and it would continuously scroll but that seemed impractical, and the #marker-list can be longer or shorter depending on how many things are on the map.</p>  <p>Any help would be appreciated!</p>
