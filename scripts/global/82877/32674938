<p>It's been days that I am trying to figure out how I can animate a text previously typed (and converted into a Path) as a SVG file in Illustrator.</p>  <p>I've followed some tutorials (<a href="https://medium.com/@gordonnl/stylised-line-animations-ded23320ffe5" rel="nofollow">this one</a> and tried to reproduce <a href="http://bit.ly/1KqvYtP" rel="nofollow">that one</a>) without success. I don't know where to start. I know I will have to make a mask in Illustrator to do it (because I want to use a font), but I really don't get it.</p>  <p>Do you guys have any idea how I can do this? Thanks.</p>
