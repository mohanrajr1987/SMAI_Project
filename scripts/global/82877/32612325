<p>I have a svg line chart that I'm trying to mimic the ability to make a selection in it. I already have the path node for the selection, but I'd like to make its width be 0 and when the user clicks over it that the width would scale to the width the user moved along x. </p>  <pre><code>&lt;path fill="#D8F2FC" d="M 497.5 1 L 497.5 274 699.5 274 699.5 1"&gt;&lt;/path&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I'd like to stick with javascript as when I use jQuery's mousedown it interferes with the click events that I have set for the parent svg element.</p>
