<p>I have directive in angular and it simply changing images and I would like to animate when img is changing. But I have no idea how to do it. My directive is: </p>  <pre><code>'user strict'; angular.module('app')     .directive('card', function ($timeout) {         return {             restrict: 'E',             replace: true,             template: '&lt;img class="animated {{anim}}" ng-src="./img/cards/{{cardid}}.png"/&gt;',             scope: {                 cardid: '@'             },             link: function (scope, elm, attrs) {                 scope.$watch('cardid', function (value) {                     scope.anim = 'cardAnim';                     $timeout(function () {                         scope.anim = '';                     }, 1000);                 });             }         };     }); </code></pre>  <p>I'm 100% sure my class .cardAnim is working properly. Because when I add this class by browser manually everything is working just fine. And I also see that this class is added to the element but nothing is happening :(</p>
