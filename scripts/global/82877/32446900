<p>I have a really strange problem: I am using jQuery v11 on the latest Chrome on localhost. While I manage to use jQuery.animate() on my website with any elements and features (including opacity), I have one element that I just can't.</p>  <p>I tried to trigger the animation within and outside the $(document).ready() function and they both resulted in the same thing. I tried with fadeTo, fadeIn/fadeOut, animate opacity, all of them the same thing. The animation starts but after a certain percentage it just doesn't continue and jumps right to the end. <em>I also tried it with e.g. padding and it works perfectly.</em></p>  <p>I am using the callback too but removing or adding it did not affect performance on either cases. Also, I have browsed through dozens or even more questions already, so I feel I did my research.</p>  <p>Thank you for your help!</p>  <p>JavaScript:</p>  <pre><code>$("#nb_copy").stop().animate({ opacity: 0 }, 300, function() { $(this).css("background-position", "-16px").stop().animate({ opacity: 1 }, 300); }); </code></pre>  <p>HTML:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div id='notes_buttons'&gt; &lt;a id='nb_copy' data-info=''&gt;C&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>CSS:</p>  <pre><code>div#notes_buttons {     width: 18px;     position: absolute;     top: 180px;     right: -24px;     opacity: 0;     filter: alpha(opacity=0); }  div#notes_buttons a {     cursor: pointer;     display: block;     width: 18px;     height: 18px;     margin-bottom: 1px;      background: red url("/db/sprite.png") no-repeat;     background-position: 0px 0px; } </code></pre>  <p>Note: I would like to use this animation in the following situation: I am animating the opacity (see, here it works...) of the parent div, then when the nb_copy button is pressed, it fades out, changes the bg position and fades back.</p>  <p>If I use really long animations (3000) and add a delay, the first animation interrupts after about 40%, then after the 3000 ms are over, it counts the delay and then the new animation. This way I have no problem with the animation. Also, if I do not use the callback, it is working. But the two interrupt each other somehow...</p>  <p>if I only use the .css in the callback, it applies instantly (the background position) but the animation runs smoothly.</p>  <p>I already spent about 1.5 hours on such a small thing... Well, if I reproduce the code above in JSfiddle, it is working: <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/g6z4xx16/" rel="nofollow">https://jsfiddle.net/g6z4xx16/</a>. I am also using Zeroclipboard with the same button, may it be the problem?</p>  <p>In case I get it out of the Zeroclipboard nest, and put it into a simple click trigger, the same result.</p>
