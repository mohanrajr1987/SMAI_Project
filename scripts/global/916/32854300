<p>I am using <code>sjPlot</code> - a package that builds off <code>ggplot2</code> which I am new to - and I am trying to change the font family to Times New Roman. Using the example code: </p>  <pre><code>require(sjPlot); require(effects) fit &lt;- lm(weight ~ Diet * Time, data = ChickWeight) sjp.int(fit, type = "eff") </code></pre>  <p>However, when I try to add an argument such as:</p>  <pre><code>theme(text = element_text(size = 14, family = "Times New Roman"))  </code></pre>  <p>It doesn't work; nor does it when I try to enter similar code in <code>sjp.setTheme()</code>. Any thoughts? Thanks.   </p>
