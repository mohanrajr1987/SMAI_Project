<p>I'm designing a webpage for a project  I'm working on, but I'm frustrated with one problem. I'm using a transparent webfont and I've been trying to fill it with text-shadows, but I still haven't come to satisfying result. What I want is a simple white background under the letters.</p>  <p>Any ideas?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
