<p>I am having issues with a C# WinForms application displaying the correct font.</p>  <p>The font I am using is <em>Moire</em>, a standard true type font with Windows.</p>  <p>The application itself is trival. A simple form with a few labels displaying the font. <em>(Regular, bold, italic etc)</em></p>  <p>According to this link, it should be a simple case of installing the font on the Mac, or adding to the Wine bottled package.</p>  <p><a href="http://winebottler.kronenberg.org/wp/faqs/category/programs/" rel="nofollow">http://winebottler.kronenberg.org/wp/faqs/category/programs/</a></p>  <p>But despite following the above, when running the application, a different font is displayed.</p>  <p>I installed the font on the Mac by double clicking the file and "<em>Install Font"</em> and all went as expected.</p>  <p>The font has also been copied to locations:</p>  <p>/Library/Fonts/Moire-Regular.ttf</p>  <p>/Macintosh HD/System/Library/Fonts/Moire-Regular.ttf</p>  <p>/User/Library/Application Support/~~appid~~/drive_c/windows/Fonts/Moire-Regular.ttf</p>  <p>~~app~~/Contents/Resources/wineprefix/drive_c/windows/Fonts/Moire-Regular.ttf</p>  <p>But still no joy.</p>  <p>Can anyone tell me the correct process to having a Winebottled WinForms app use the font as expected?</p>
