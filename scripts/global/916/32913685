<p>I saw a work flow on a different question for using automator to set font and size of text in any application. The shell script is below. The "Run Shell Script" portion is below.  I would like to add the ability to set text color to blue but cannot figure out the syntax.  I tried to just add something like "-textcolor 0,0,242" but no go."  Any help is appreciated. </p>  <p>pbpaste -Prefer rtf | textutil -stdin -convert rtf -font 'Myriad Set Pro text' -fontsize 24 -stdout | pbcopy</p>  <p>Sorry if this is posted incorrectly.</p>  <p>Original question: <a href="http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/63335/in-keynote-is-there-any-way-to-assign-shortcut-keys-to-select-specific-fonts/63362#63362">http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/63335/in-keynote-is-there-any-way-to-assign-shortcut-keys-to-select-specific-fonts/63362#63362</a></p>
