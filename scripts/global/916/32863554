<p>I am working with vector images in Android and I need access to the actual glyph data. Like the Bezier curves that make up the font. Is there any way to access this data? I've debated converting fonts to SVG and reading those because I already have that ability. Or coding up a custom TTF parser. But, these solutions would also require a download or adding a bunch of extra TTF or SVG assets. And a perhaps a lot of work that might not be needed.</p>  <p>Is there some way to get access to the glyph data of a given font?</p>  <p>That failing, is there some way to get access to the actual ttf (or whatever font type Android uses) files?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Peetl.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Peetl.png" alt="letter H"></a></p>
