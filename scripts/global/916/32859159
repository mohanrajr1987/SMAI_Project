<p>I've been using Font Awesome for a while and I wonder one thing which tag should I use for it.</p>  <p><a href="https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/examples/" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is said that they like the <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> tag for brevity, but using a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> is more semantically correct.</p>  <p>I read <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html" rel="nofollow">specification</a> for <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#the-i-element" rel="nofollow"><code>&lt;i&gt;</code></a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#the-span-element" rel="nofollow"><code>&lt;span&gt;</code></a>. Unfortunately, I can't find the difference, they're both have the same context in which they can be used.</p>
