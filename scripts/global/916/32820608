<p>I wanted to make my site secure (Redirect from http to https). So I used <code>.htaccess</code> for that. The following is my code:</p>  <pre><code>RewriteEngine On RewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on RewriteRule ^.*$ https://%{SERVER_NAME}%{REQUEST_URI} [R,L] </code></pre>  <p>What I just noticed is that after I use <code>.htaccess</code>, the whole site gets messed up and most of the css works except fonts.</p>
