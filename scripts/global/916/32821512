<p>We are developing a responsive website with WordPress and introduced sliders with Revslider. But, as we have tested it with iPhone6+ using safari after loading in 2-3 slides font get pixelated and shows blur text title and description. </p>  <p>Can anyone suggest Slider setting / CSS patch to make font consistent in all the medium? Surprisingly, iPad and iPhone5 shows appropriate fonts in slider only iPhone6 has font pixelation issue. </p>
