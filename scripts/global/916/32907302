<p>I would like to get Tamil words which are entered in Textview and convert it to Unicode format so that I can send it to server then get it back for displaying the same in the Textview whenever needed.</p>  <p>I am able to enter and see the Tamil words using the external Tamil keyboard app got from the playstore.</p>  <p>The problem is I searched a lot and didn't find any solution to convert it to the unicode format to store it into server database.</p>  <p>Thanks for looking into this issue</p>
