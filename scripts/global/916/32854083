<p>I know you can get the <code>font-family</code> value by <code>window.getComputedStyle()</code> but that's not always exactly the font that is used by a browser to render. For example, if the given text contains the (multi-lingual) text the font family does not carry, the browser renders the text partially with the system font.</p>  <p>If you take a look at the built-in web developer tool, either in Chrome or Firefox, they both have a little area to display (<code>Rendered Fonts</code> pane on Chrome or <code>Fonts</code> tab on Firefox) the exact fonts that are used. For the Firefox, I guess <a href="https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/devtools/client/fontinspector/font-inspector.js" rel="nofollow">this code</a> is used and it seems to be calling the internal API.</p>  <p>I'm looking for any DOM-compliant (or vendor-specific) way to get the exact font from the JavaScript land or else. If that means writing a browser extension/add-on to provide API/inject info/whatever for the in-page code to access, that's the worst case, but acceptable.</p>
