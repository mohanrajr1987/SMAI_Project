<p>Recently I noticed that in my Windows 8.1 laptop rendering of the fonts is not optimal.</p>  <p>For example, Arial font, Notepad, 100pt (see it in full size) <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/jaXbz.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/jaXbz.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>The rendering on the curves (in e, o and c noticeably) is somehow "broken".</p>  <p>This happens with every font. Another example, a webpage header in 65pt in firefox and chrome: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/pWMnr.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/pWMnr.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>But on Internet Explorer the font renders perfectly smooth <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/FV0hl.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/FV0hl.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>So does in Word 2013: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/VWp3J.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/VWp3J.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <hr>  <p>ClearType is On and configured, monitor is in it's native resolution, a virtual machine on the same PC running Fedora doesn't have this issue, the infamous issue with the windows update package that affected font-rendering doesn't apply to me as my OS is windows 8.1 (and the update is not installed anyway), some other win 8.1 users don't have the same issue and finally I'm running on a dual GPU laptop (Intel HD4600 and ATI Radeon 8650M with both drivers up-to-date).</p>  <p>Any idea where should I look to fix this problem?</p>
