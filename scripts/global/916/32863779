<p>I have a quick question about WCAG 2.0 AA accessibility. </p>  <p>We know that heading should be something like H1 - H2 - H3 etc. When stepping down through headings, skipping levels should be avoided. That means that an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> is followed by an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, an <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> is followed by a <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> etc. </p>  <p>However, what happens when we use css styles on this headings. </p>  <p>For example, let us assume we have several H3 s on a page. Now let us assume some of these H3 have style font-weight bold. Some of these h3 have style font-weight normal. Some of these h3 have style font-family: Arial. Some have font-family: Helvetica etc. Some have these h3 have style font-size: 24px. Some of these h3 have font-size: 20px. Does this sort of styling making H3 looks different slightly on the same page violating the WCAG 2.0 AA accessibility?</p>  <p>What about usability? Does it not violate good practice for usability?</p>
