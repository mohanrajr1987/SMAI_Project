<p>I want to use Archer font family on one of my sites. When I try to find the the font I see following two options:</p>  <ol> <li><a href="http://www.typography.com/fonts/archer/webfonts/" rel="nofollow">http://www.typography.com/fonts/archer/webfonts/</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.cufonfonts.com/en/font/13323/archer-book" rel="nofollow">http://www.cufonfonts.com/en/font/13323/archer-book</a></li> </ol>  <p>Typography has pay per use plan under which I can directly use the font.</p>  <p>On the other hand cufonfonts.com lets me download the webfonts for the Archer font family and I can use them directly on my site using @font-face. It is also free.</p>  <p>So can any one tell me if there is something that I may have missed out with the CufonFonts. Is there any downside to using the CufonFonts or if it is not legal. I have tried to use the CufonFonts and it works fine. So can someone please suggest the right way.</p>  <p>Note: I cannot use any substitute font for the Archer. That is a hard requirement. So either I use the free Cufonfonts or I'll have to purchase the typography plan. </p>
