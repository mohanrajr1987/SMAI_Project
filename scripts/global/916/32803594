<p>I'm 99.9% certain I have this right, but for some reason it isn't working.</p>  <p>I'm making a chrome extension that injects CSS onto a page, and my CSS has been working fine right up until I wanted to change the fonts.</p>  <p>So my manifest has this...</p>  <pre><code>"css": ["css/my-custom.css"], "js": [ "js/jquery.js", "js/my-custom.js", "js/jquery.cookie.js"], "web_accessible_resources": ["css/my-custom.css", "fonts/Roboto-Regular.ttf", "images/*.*"] </code></pre>  <p>...and my CSS has this...</p>  <pre><code>@font-face {     font-family: 'RobotoLtRegular';     src: url('chrome-extension://__MSG_@@extension_id__/fonts/Roboto-Regular.ttf');     font-weight: normal;     font-style: normal; }  body {     background: #f1f1f1 !important;     font-size: 1.2em !important;     font-family: RobotoLtRegular !important; }  p {     font-family: RobotoLtRegular !important; } </code></pre>  <p>...and yet when I reload my extension I don't see the new font. The chrome element inspector also shows that this font should be the one shown on body and p (there are no other fonts overriding RobotoLtRegular.</p>  <p>FYI my fonts are stored in the css directory of the extension, so the path is correct.</p>  <p>I'm at a complete loss.</p>  <p>Any suggestions would be helpful.</p>  <p>UPDATE: If it helps to know, I am loading it as an unpacked extension.</p>
