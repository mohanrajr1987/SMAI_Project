<p>I am using the following command to draw legend on my plot. Since I have more than 30 labels, some of my labels are outside of my plot. I need to know how to decrease the size of my plot.</p>  <pre><code>grid_legend(0.9, 0.6, pch, col, labels, title="Bacterial Phyla") </code></pre>  <p>I tried using <code>cex=1</code> command and <code>text.width=0.5</code> comment. But it didn't work. I get an error stating:</p>  <pre><code>"Error in grid_legend(0.9, 0.5, pch, col, labels, text.width = 0.5, title = "Bacterial Class") :    unused argument (text.width = 0.5)" </code></pre>
