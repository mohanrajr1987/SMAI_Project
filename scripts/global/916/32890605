<p>I've updated OSX some hours ago to El Capitan and the font of my Xcode c++ project started to create some problem. </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/U7Y8P.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/U7Y8P.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>As you can see the margin of the font are ok and you can barely read the text, but It should be white-filled; also I haven't changed nothing before the update. I know that one of the El Capitan's new features is the new San Francisco font, but It shouldn't be used as a system font? Is there some fix I should do?</p>  <p>Thanks.  </p>
