<p>I am building print products for an EFI Digital Storefront using DirectSmile, a variable data program that plugs in to InDesign and the Digital Storefront. Complex formatting of variable data fields can be done within DirectSmile with javascript.</p>  <p>I can add javascript for formatting, but there is no css or html I can work with in conjunction with the js. I just add the snippet of js to the variable data field, save and export the file, and upload to Digital Storefront.</p>  <p>javascript > variable data field > Directsmile document > zipped product > Digital Storefront</p>  <p>Right now I am working on a business card. It displays its phone numbers like this:</p>  <p>Office 123.456.7890<br> Cell 123.456.7890<br> Fax 123.456.7890</p>  <p>where the words Office, Cell, and Fax are supposed to be in one font (8pt Archer bold) and the numbers are supposed to be in another (8pt Graphik Light). This needs to be defined in javascript but I don't know how. I'm very new to this, and research isn't panning out- every method I've found seems to require access to html/css, which I don't have.</p>  <p>This is the javascript I've used in the past to format phone numbers so the preceding labels ("Office" "Cell" "Fax") only appear if the associated phone number is used by the customer, and to format the phone number itself:</p>  <p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false"> <div class="snippet-code"> <pre class="snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>function numbers(){     out = ""     num = VAR.GetS("Office_Phone", "")       if(num.length&gt;0) out += "OFFICE" + phone(num) + "\n";  else out = "" + out;     num = VAR.GetS("Cell_Phone", "")         if(num.length&gt;0) out += "CELL" + phone(num) + "\n";  else out = "" + out;     num = VAR.GetS("Fax", "")                if(num.length&gt;0) out += "FAX" + phone(num) + "\n";  else out = "" + out;     return out; }  function phone(number){     tmp = ""; div = ".";     if( number.length&gt;0 ){         tmp = number.replace(/\D/g, "");         var len = tmp.length;         tmp = tmp.split("");         tmp.splice(len-7,0, div);         tmp.splice(len-3,0, div);         tmp = tmp.join("");     }     return tmp; }</code></pre> </div> </div> </p>  <p>What can I add/change to have the preceding label ("Office" "Cell" "Fax") appear as 8pt Archer bold and the phone numbers as 8pt Graphik Light?</p>  <p>All help greatly appreciated. Thank you</p>
