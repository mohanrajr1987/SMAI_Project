<p>I am using asp.net mvc-5 with EF-6, and I am not sure if using await + <code>ToListAsync</code> is valid . For example I have the following repository method which return an IQurable :-</p>  <pre><code>public IQueryable&lt;TSet&gt; getAllScanEmailTo() {     return t.TSets.Where(a=&gt;a.Name.StartsWith("ScanEmail"));     } </code></pre>  <p>And I am calling it as follow:-</p>  <pre><code>var emailsTo = await repository.getAllScanEmailTo().ToListAsync(); </code></pre>  <p>At the beginning I though I will get an error because I am using "await" a method which is not defined as a task,, but the above worked well ,, so can anyone advice on this please ?</p>
