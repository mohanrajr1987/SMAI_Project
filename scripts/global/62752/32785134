<p>Lets say you have a service API call. The callee is somewhat performance critical, so in order not to hold up the API call any longer than necessary, there's an <code>SaveAsync()</code> method that is used. I can't <code>await</code> it, however, because that would hold up the API call just as long (or perhaps even longer) than the non-async version.</p>  <p>The reason I'm asking is this: If you <strong>don't</strong> <code>await</code> the call, is there a chance the <code>Task</code> object returned gets garbage collected? And if so, would that interrupt the running task?</p>
