<p>I have the following code (<code>_ns</code> is a NetworkStream)</p>  <pre><code>await GetResponse(_ns); btnSend.Enabled = true;  private async Task GetResponse(NetworkStream stream) {     while (true)     {         var readBuffer = new byte[4096];         var asyncReader = await stream.ReadAsync(readBuffer, 0, readBuffer.Length);         txtBoxMessagesIn.Text += Encoding.ASCII.GetString(readBuffer.ToArray()) + Environment.NewLine;         if (asyncReader &lt;= 0) break;     } } </code></pre>  <p>I seem to fill the entire buffer with what I expect, but btnSend is never enabled.</p>  <p>When I run it in debug mode, my while loop runs a couple of times, I see <code>asyncReader</code> get set to different values but it never equals 0 to break the loop as I expect, it justs exits at the line:</p>  <pre><code>var asyncReader = await stream.ReadAsync(readBuffer, 0, readBuffer.Length); </code></pre>  <p>without generating any errors. What is causing this? Do I need to set something in Visual Studio to break on this type of error?</p>
