<p>There are a bunch of rather convenient methods in <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.file%28v=vs.110%29.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>File</code></a> class, like <code>ReadAll***</code>/<code>WriteAll***</code>/<code>AppendAll***</code>.</p>  <p>I'm faced with a number of cases, when I need their asynchronous counterparts, but they just don't exist.</p>  <p>Why? Are there any pitfalls?<br> I know, that these methods could be easily implemented, but is there any reason to not implement them in the framework out-of-the-box?</p>
