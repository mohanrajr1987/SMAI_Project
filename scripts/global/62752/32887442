<p>I am using Async await with Task.Factory method.</p>  <pre><code>public async Task&lt;JobDto&gt; ProcessJob(JobDto jobTask) {     try     {         var T = Task.Factory.StartNew(() =&gt;         {             JobWorker jobWorker = new JobWorker();             jobWorker.Execute(jobTask);         });          await T;     } </code></pre>  <p>This method I am calling inside a loop like this</p>  <pre><code>for(int i=0; i &lt; jobList.Count(); i++) {     tasks[i] = ProcessJob(jobList[i]); } </code></pre>  <p>What I notice is that new tasks opens up inside Process explorer and they also start working (based on log file). however out of 10 sometimes 8 or sometimes 7 finishes. Rest of them just never come back.</p>  <ol> <li>why would that be happening ? </li> <li>Are they timing out ? Where can I set timeout for my tasks ?</li> </ol>  <p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>  <p>Basically above, I would like each Task to start running as soon as they are called and wait for the response on AWAIT T keyword. I am assuming here that once they finish each of them will come back at Await T and do the next action. I am alraedy seeing this result for 7 out of 10 tasks but 3 of them are not coming back.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
