<p>I know this question has been asked a bunch of times on StackOverflow, but none of the answers seem to fit my situation, or they just tell them to allow NULL fields in their DateTime (which I don't want to do).</p>  <p>Here is the code:</p>  <pre><code>public async Task&lt;int&gt; CreateJobAsync(JobViewModel jvm)     {         Job j = new Job();         j.Name = jvm.Name;         j.UserId = jvm.UserId;         j.ClassDefinition = jvm.ClassDefinition;         j.DaysToRun = jvm.DaysToRun;         j.ToEmail = jvm.ToEmail;         j.Active = true;         j.CreatedDate = DateTime.Now;         j.ModifiedDate = DateTime.Now;          context.Jobs.Add(j);         var result = await context.SaveChangesAsync();          return result;     } </code></pre>  <p>All my fields in the <code>Job</code> class are <code>DateTime</code> as are the object in the database.  The date values are not <code>NULL</code>.  When I run <strong>Sql Profiler</strong>, it doesn't even show that a database call was made.</p>  <p>The Error occurs on the <code>await</code> call and it is:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>conversion of a datetime2 data type to a datetime data type resulted in an out-of-range value</p> </blockquote>  <p>This seems like a fairly easy example and I do need these values to be <code>not null</code>.   Any other ideas???</p>
