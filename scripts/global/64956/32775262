<p>I just started working on android and facing a problem, I've created a layout which consist of two edittext and a FrameLayout. I'm opening a Listview(Fragment) inside that frame layout. Now i want this frame layout to appear below first edittext when user clicks the first edittext and same for the other edittext I've coded for the first editText but don't know how to do it for the second one. So please tell me how can i move it below the second editText.  Thank you guys.</p>
