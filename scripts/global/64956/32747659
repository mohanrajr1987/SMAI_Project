<p>Since I'm using scanner, after scanning the barcode into edittext I need to get text from the edittext automatically and check the record for that barcode from the local database.</p>  <p>I know that there is <code>addTextChangedListener</code> for getting the text from the edittext automatically. But there are issues with that like it is checking each character of barcode when scanned instead of checking the barcode string in the local database.</p>
