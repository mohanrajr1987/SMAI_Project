<p>Here is the scenario. </p>  <p>I have an EditText. This EditText should be able to limit text input to a set of certain words (a custom "dictionary").  Words may be added by clicking the respective button (no keyboard input!).</p>  <p>Words in the EditText can be deleted by positioning the cursor behind a word and hitting a "backspace button". On a delete action, the whole word should be deleted (instead of a single character). </p>  <p>Cursor positioning in between characters of a word shouldn't be possible.</p>  <p>Example: </p>  <p>Button 1: "Car" Button 2: "drives"  Button 3: "slowly"</p>  <p>Clicking Button 1,2,3 adds the respective word to the EditText.</p>  <p>Content EditText: "Car drives slowly"</p>  <p>Positioning of cursor only able before or after every word. Deletion of word only possible as a whole.</p>  <p>Is that possible at all? Thanks in advance.</p>
