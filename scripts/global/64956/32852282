<p>Before marking my question as <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12387492/how-do-i-convert-a-string-to-title-case-in-android">duplicate</a>, notice that there is a fundamental misunderstanding in that thread as to what "title case" means. In the english language, <em>Title Case</em> is not the same as having each word capitalized. In a title, we should</p>  <ul> <li>Capitalize nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs, and subordinate conjunctions.</li> <li>Lowercase articles (a, an, the), coordinating conjunctions, and prepositions.</li> </ul>  <p>Since the similar question I am pointing to is also a bit dated, I was wondering if anyone is aware of any facility in android to <strong>convert a string to a title case</strong>? Or is the only option to roll out my own class?</p>  <p>For some background if you care, I am building an app that has some user generated contents, in addition to expert generated contents. I want my app to look intelligent and professional. So for the EditText I enable <code>textAutoComplete|textAutoCorrect</code>. But in addition, I want the title to look like titles, not just strings that have been typed by random users.</p>
