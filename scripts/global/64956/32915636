<p>so i have an activity with some editTexts inside and outside a listView, and the context menu was fine since i realy dont need to do anything to get the context menu working...</p>  <p>so yesterday, i implemented a custom toolbar for that activity since i need a custom layout for my action bar, and all is working fine but Edittexts inside the listView wont open the context menu on longclick. (EditText outside lisview work correctly).</p>  <p>the listview edittexts context menu opens and close inmediatly and when it shows i can see it is empty... this is very strange....</p>  <p>dont have a clue on this...</p>  <p>oh and the edittexs is losing focus when longclick...</p>  <p>Any ideas on whats happening?</p>
