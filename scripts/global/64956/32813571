<p>I am making an android app, everything works really well, except if freezes (does not respond) when I input text Anywhere in the Activity.</p>  <p>I am not getting a crash (so i don't have a logcat error), but rather an unresponsive app as soon as I try to input text in any field (EditText or SearchView) in my entire application even if it is an AlertBuilder Dialog. </p>  <p>UPDATE (SOLVED!!!!)</p>  <p>After quite a while and searching every thread on the internet, I finally figured it out. If you have problems with this check your theme. I changed mine from Holo.Light to Material.Light and it resolved the issue, no idea why, but it worked.</p>
