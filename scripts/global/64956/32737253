<p>Weird issue just started happening to me, and I haven't touched that file in months. </p>  <p>The past two days or so I've been working on the new version of Android (6.0) API 23. Today I noticed when trying to login to my app, the password field was completely visible. I've been working on runtime permissions, removing permissions that I don't think I need and adding it code to ask for permissions at runtime. The <code>Activity</code> this <code>EditText</code> field is in, has not been touched in months. Yet somehow when I type inside it, I can see all the characters. Here is the EditText just to be sure I'm not missed anything obvious:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;EditText     android:id="@+id/password"     android:layout_width="match_parent"     android:layout_height="wrap_content"     android:background="@android:color/white"     android:hint="@string/password"     android:textColorHint="@color/light_grey"     android:imeOptions="actionDone"     android:inputType="textPassword"     android:paddingBottom="20dp"     android:paddingLeft="20dp"     android:paddingTop="20dp"     android:layout_marginLeft="15dp"     android:layout_marginRight="15dp"             android:textColor="@color/text_gray"/&gt; </code></pre>  <p>The app now points to API 23, buildTools 23.0.1 and all support libraries updated to v23.0.1. I tested my app on two phones, one Lollipop 5.1.1, the other on 6.0 M Preview 3. Both have a visible password. In fact there are two Activitesin my app that have a password field, when you register, and when you login, both have <code>textPassword</code> as the <code>inputType</code> but all characters are visible in both.</p>  <p>I checked the M preview issue tracker and did not find anything so I'm turning here.</p>  <p>One thing that makes be believe this is Android 6.0 related is that I just downloaded our live app from the Google Play Store, which is pointing to API 22 and the <code>EditText</code> field works just fine.</p>  <p>Something very peculiar is going on and I can't figure it out. Would really appreciate some input, thanks in advance for any comments you have.</p>  <p><strong>Edit:</strong> Found out that setting textAllCaps to false in my styles.xml was causing this, no idea why. Something to do with v23.0.1 of AppCompat?</p>
