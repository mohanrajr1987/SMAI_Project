<p>I'm working on messaging app. On Conversation activity i need to put Banner on the bottom of the screen under <code>EditText</code> as shown in the picture</p>  <p><img src="http://i1375.photobucket.com/albums/ag456/deplacer/device-2015-09-22-151944_zpszshp3lts.png" /></p>  <p>But I want when the softkeyboard is visible the Banner ad whel move under the softkeyboard. On this problem i used <code>AdjustPan</code>. And it works! It hides the banner ad when the softkeyboard is visible. But the <code>ActionBar/Toolbar</code> hides.  <img src="http://i1375.photobucket.com/albums/ag456/deplacer/device-2015-09-22-114833_zpsoe0bweer.png"/></p>  <p>I already tried using <code>AjustResize</code>. This will prevent <code>Actionbar/Toolbar</code> from hiding when softkeyboard is visible. But this will also cause the banner ad to show above the softkeyboard. That is what i don't like.</p>  <p>I show an app that used banner ad under <code>EditText</code> but when softkeyboard is visible the banner ads disappear. </p>
