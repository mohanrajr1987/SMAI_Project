<p>I can't figure out how to not pass any options to the <code>option:</code> parameter in <code>UIView.animateWithDuration</code> In obj-C would simply pass <code>0</code>, but the compiler won't allow that. I've tried passing <code>nil</code>, <code>0</code>, <code>()</code>, and <code>_</code>. This is using the latest version of Swift with Xcode beta 7.1  Thanks </p>  <pre><code>override func viewDidAppear(animated: Bool) {      UIView.animateWithDuration(3,          delay: 0,          usingSpringWithDamping: 1,          initialSpringVelocity: 0,          options: //what goes here??? ,          animations: { () -&gt; Void in              let transform = CGAffineTransformMakeRotation(360)             self.titleLabel.transform = transform          },          completion: { (finished) -&gt; Void in          })  } </code></pre>
