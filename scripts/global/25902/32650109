<p>In my app I have lots of VCs with scrollviews of all kinds (table, collection, etc.). All of them appear inside NavigationController and I used <code>.automaticallyadjustsscrollviewinsets</code> property of VC to prevent content from going under the NavigationBar. It works fine prior to iOS9.</p>  <p>I've updated my test iPhone to iOS9 yesterday and noticed that all scrollviews now does not have proper insets. I've updated XCode to latest version (7.0) and rebuilt the app - no effect. I've checked on the other device, which is still running iOS8.x - insets work correctly. I looked through iOS9 sdk changelogs and didn't find anything related to my problem. Is this a bug or a new behaviour? Anyone else having this problem? Possible solutions?</p>  <p>UPDATE:</p>  <p>I've came up with quick fix:</p>  <pre><code>if (__iOS_9_OR_GREATER_) {      CGFloat topInset = 20;      if (self.navigationController) {         topInset += self.navigationController.navigationBar.bounds.size.height;     }      UIEdgeInsets insets = UIEdgeInsetsMake(topInset, 0, 0, 0);      self.collectionView.contentInset = insets;     self.collectionView.scrollIndicatorInsets = insets;  } </code></pre>  <p>It works. But question is still relevant, is this a bug in iOS9?</p>
