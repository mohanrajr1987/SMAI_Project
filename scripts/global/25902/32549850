<p>I'm working in a demo for tvOS, I found that you can build your app either with UIKit or with TVML markup language with Javascript. I have checked the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/tvos/samplecode/UICatalogFortvOS/" rel="nofollow">UIKit Catalog</a> and the <a href="http://TVML%20Catalog:%20Using%20TVML%20Templates" rel="nofollow">TVML Catalog</a> and they look great. I have two question:</p>  <ol> <li>How can we handle logic of javascript while using TVML? will be in JS also in JS files or we will write Swift code to handle logic?</li> <li>Is this possible to combine TVML screens with UIKit screen from storyboard?</li> </ol>
