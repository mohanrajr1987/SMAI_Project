<p>On my iPhone app I have it restricted to portrait only under the project targets deployment info</p>  <p>There is one page that I want only in landscape and I use the supportedInterfaceOrientations method to obtain that. </p>  <p>Standard implementation:</p>  <pre><code>override func supportedInterfaceOrientations() -&gt; UIInterfaceOrientationMask {         return UIInterfaceOrientationMask.Landscape     } </code></pre>  <p>It works perfectly on all iPhone devices and iOS version except for iPhone 6+. The supportedInterfaceOrientations method is never called.</p>  <p>I cant find any reason why this might be affecting just the iPhone 6+, any tips would be greatly apreciated.</p>
