<p>On top of my <code>UICollectionViewCell</code>s in my <code>UICollectionView</code> I've overlaid a <code>UIButton</code> that intercepts touches so I can respond to touch events more granularly. The issue is that now the collection view no longer gets <code>didSelectItemAtIndexPath</code> messages. (For obvious reasons... the button has absorbed the touch and isn't signaling to the collection view that the item was selected.)</p>  <p>Is there a way to signal to the collection view that the cell was selected? I've seen similar questions but none seem to give a convincing answer. </p>
