<p>In the method <code>collectionView:numberOfItemsInSection:</code> I have the following code:</p>  <pre><code>collectionView.hidden = (currentSection.numberOfObjects &lt; 1) </code></pre>  <p>I am expecting the entire collection-view to hide, but I get the background color where the collection-view would be visible.  I also have an IBOutlet that is the collection-view which I tried and I get the same results (e.g., <code>self.collectionView.hidden = (etc.)</code></p>  <p>Is there more that needs to be hidden??</p>  <p>NB. I am able to successfully do this with a <code>UITableView</code>.</p>
