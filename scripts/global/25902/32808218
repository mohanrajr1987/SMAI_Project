<p>I'm building custom UIView that takes in initialization array of input fields <code>UITextField</code> or <code>UITextView</code>. I need this custom view to be notified when input field begin editing <strong>without setting the delegate</strong>.</p>  <ol> <li>In <code>UITextField</code> I came up with an idea by adding observer for the <code>editing</code> property. Do you have other Ideas?</li> <li>I can't find <code>editing</code> in <code>UITextView</code> so what should I do.</li> </ol>  <p>The idea is that I need this custom view as a standalone and let users free to set the delegate in their <code>UIViewControllers</code></p>
