<p>I'm quite new to iOS drawing and I have some difficulties to see the different strategies (only one view that draws everything, a view that use other subviews, ...).</p>  <p>I would like to draw a graph like this : <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/kfUhy.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/kfUhy.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I'm confused about how to draw this :</p>  <p><strong>1st solution</strong></p>  <p>1) draw what I call a "unit bar" (for example the first red bar below) in a UnitBarView file.</p>  <p>2) creating a second view "FourUnitBarsView" which would be an addition of 4 UnitBarView.</p>  <p>3) drawing the graph in a new view using "FourUnitBarsView"</p>  <p><strong>2nd solution</strong></p>  <p>1) drawing a unit of four bars "FourUnitBarsView" passing an array of colors and an array of values.</p>  <p>3) drawing the graph in a new view using as many subviews ("FourUnitBarsView") as necessary</p>  <p><strong>3rd solution</strong></p>  <p>using just one view and drawing everything in it</p>
