<p>iOS 9 <a href="https://twitter.com/silvandaehn/status/609042671798263808" rel="nofollow">changed the corner radius</a> used for things like modal form sheets and action sheets. What is the new dimension, and what was the old from iOS 8 and previous?</p>  <p>My specific reason for asking is that I have a need to do a form sheet presentation on iPhone, so I'm doing my own custom modal transition animator. But I want to match the rounded corners of the system.</p>
