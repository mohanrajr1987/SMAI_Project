<p>I have two UIPageViewControllers ("Overview", "Active") as child view controllers to one main View Controller called "Log". I switch between them using the hidden property and a segmented control. </p>  <p>Illustration: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/ebuqpr5.png" rel="nofollow">http://i.imgur.com/ebuqpr5.png</a></p>  <p>For some reason, only the page view controller that is at the top of the hierarchy in Interface Builder receives touch events. If I switch to the other page view controller, then the touch event is consumed by "Log" before it reaches it, even though the underlying page view controller is not hidden. Why is this happening and how do I fix it?</p>
