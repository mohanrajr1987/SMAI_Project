<p>I'm using Uikit/angularjs and i would create a general function to close the modals. Actually this is method:</p>  <pre><code>$scope.closeDialog = function() {             var modal = UIkit.modal("#myModalId");             if ( modal.isActive() ) {                 modal.hide();             }         }; </code></pre>  <p>and inside the modal i've got </p>  <pre><code>&lt;button type="button" class="uk-button uk-button-primary" data-ng-click="closeDialog()"&gt;Close&lt;/button&gt; </code></pre>  <p>It works, but in this way i need create always a new function for every single Modal.. Is there a way to generalize this function maybe pass to the function the id of the dialog? I created a jsfiddle and strangly seems not working even if i get the exaclty id: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/8y48q/62/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/8y48q/62/</a></p>
