<p>I want to reset (set progress to 0) my UIProgressView after the following code:</p>  <pre><code>// uploadProgress: UIProgressView!  uploadProgress.progress = 0 uploadProgress.setProgress(1.0, animated: true) </code></pre>  <p>I can't set uploadProgress.progress to 0 right after this block because then no animation will appear. </p>  <p>I don't want to edit the animation duration either. </p>  <p>I just want the progress to go back to 0 <strong>AFTER</strong> the animation is <strong>fully complete</strong>.</p>  <p>I would greatly appreciate your help. Thank you in advance!</p>
