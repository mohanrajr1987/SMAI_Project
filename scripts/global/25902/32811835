<p>I want to make something like iOS9 split view in my app.  If you are not familiar with what I'm talking about here is what it looks like: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/iHRNi.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/iHRNi.png" alt="enter image description here"></a> Basically I want a ability to finger-adjust the width of two view-controllers. Is there any drop-in solutions for that? If not, how do I implement thing like that?</p>
