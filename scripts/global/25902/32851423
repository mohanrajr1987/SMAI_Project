<p>I'm working on an universal app with the last UISplitViewController instance (post iOS8, working on both iPhone and iPad)</p>  <p>Apple bests practices says that on a simple table view, opening a new details view, you should show a disclosure indicator BUT that when your splitview is shown on an iPad, you should show no accessory to the master's tableview.</p>  <p>So i came up with this code in my cellForRowAtIndexPath function :</p>  <pre><code>cell.accessoryType = self.splitViewController!.collapsed ? .DisclosureIndicator : .None; </code></pre>  <p>This works well, but some time, the splitviewcontroller changes, for example on iPhone 6 plus, when you rotate your device, or on iPad, when you use multitasking split-screen feature, the masters table view should hide or show again the accessory view, (and it does for new loaded cells like it should), but I would need to reload the whole tableview.</p>  <p>For now, I haven't found a function that trigger after the view changed his layout, to trigger my <code>tableview.reloadData()</code>.</p>  <p>Can someone tell me was is the best practice to reload my tableview and make sure the accessory changes like it should for all cells when my splitview layout changes ?</p>
