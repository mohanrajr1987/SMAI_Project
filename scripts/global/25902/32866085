<p>I want to create circular animation in Apple watch using Core Graphics. I want to create an animation like Earth is revolving around the sun continuously. I have tried the method below but it crashes the application on watch after some time. Please share your suggestions and ideas on this.</p>  <p>Attempt:</p>  <pre><code>UIGraphicsBeginImageContext(contextSize); CGContextRef context    = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext(); CGContextSetStrokeColorWithColor(context, [UIColor whiteColor].CGColor);  [sprite.image drawAtPoint:sprite.position];  // Convert to UIImage CGImageRef imgRef       = CGBitmapContextCreateImage(context); self.lastImage          = [UIImage imageWithCGImage:imgRef];  // End the graphics context UIGraphicsEndImageContext();  [self.container setImage:self.lastImage]; </code></pre>  <ol> <li><code>TGESprite</code> is my own custom class having an two objects <strong>1. UIImage</strong> and <strong>2. CGPoint</strong> its position.</li> <li>In above code I find the point of a circular path of a specified radius and draw image on that series of position after a regular interval of time.</li> <li>When I try to smooth the animation and reduce the interval time to 25 times in a second. It only runs for two iterations and then crashes.</li> <li>In nutshell, I want to create a circular animation in which I have a complete control of object that is revolving.</li> </ol>
