<p>Before presenting a view controller I set the <code>modalPresentationStyle</code> property to <code>UIModalPresentationPopover</code>. This will present the view controller as a popover when running on devices with a regular horizontal size class (iPad and iPhone 6+ in landscape) and as modal/fullscreen on other devices. It's also possible to override this behaviour by overriding <code>adaptivePresentationStyleForPresentationController</code> so that the view controller is presented as a popover on all devices.</p>  <p>I wonder if it's possible, after a view controller is presented, to know if it's presented as a popover or not? Just looking at the size class won't do it as it's possible that the view controller overrides <code>adaptivePresentationStyleForPresentationController</code>.</p>  <p>The obvious answer would be that I, as the programmer, should know if I override <code>adaptivePresentationStyleForPresentationController</code> or not but I want to write a function that can determine this in runtime for any view controller by passing in the view controller or maybe the <code>UIPopoverPresentationController</code> (or any other object needed) as an argument.</p>  <p>Here's some code to present the view controller:</p>  <pre><code>navigationController = (UINavigationController *)[MVSStore sharedInstance].addViewController; navigationController.modalPresentationStyle = UIModalPresentationPopover; [self presentViewController:navigationController animated:YES completion:^{}];  UIPopoverPresentationController *popoverController = navigationController.popoverPresentationController; popoverController.sourceView = self.view; popoverController.sourceRect = CGRectMake(20, 20, 20, 20); // Just a dummy popoverController.permittedArrowDirections = UIPopoverArrowDirectionAny; </code></pre>  <p>Here's the current code to detect if the view controller is presented as a popover or not. But as mentioned above it just looks at the size class which doesn't work for all cases.</p>  <pre><code>+ (BOOL)willPresentTruePopover:(id&lt;UITraitEnvironment&gt;)vc {     return ([vc traitCollection].horizontalSizeClass == UIUserInterfaceSizeClassRegular); } </code></pre>  <p>I cannot find any property or function in <code>UIViewController</code> or <code>UIPopoverPresentationController</code> (or anywhere else) that gives me this information right away but maybe I'm missing something?</p>
