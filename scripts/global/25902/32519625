<p>I'm trying to handle </p>  <pre><code>- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application openURL:(NSURL *)url sourceApplication:(NSString *)sourceApplication annotation:(id)annotation </code></pre>  <p>with SDL2 on iOS. It sends me SDL_DROP_FILE event and everything fine, when my app is running already. But if i'm trying to START my app with "Open with" dialog from Dropbox or whatever, i never get this event. I've tried to watch arguments in </p>  <pre><code>int SDL_main(int argc, char *argv[]) </code></pre>  <p>before i start handling SDL events, but no luck.</p>  <p>I'm not very familiar witch UIKit, so if i missing some kind of (UIApplication*) startAppWithUrl, please tell me.</p>
