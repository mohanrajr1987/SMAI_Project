<p>I have subclassed UIWebView to add custom UIMenuController functionality in and it was working pretty well up until iOS 9. I am not sure what has changed, but now I am running into a situation where when I tap on a link, that should present the menu, the menu shows up briefly, but is dismissed (with no more tapping from me).</p>  <p>I am having a hard time figuring out where that dismissal is originating from. I am observing the <code>UIMenuControllerDidHideMenuNotification</code> notification, and that is indeed being called right after the menu disappears, but I am having a hard time finding the cause of the dismissal.</p>  <p>I recognize that there are many different issues that could be lurking, but I am wondering if anyone has experienced something like this before? Is there a way to track somehow the cause of the dismissal?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/GDf8o.gif" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/GDf8o.gif" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
