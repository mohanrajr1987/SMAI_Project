<p>I want to display images on an arc between two points. I have a starting CGPoint and an ending CGPoint. I've seen answers for something like this using SceneKit and other answers that produce entire arches and graphs. I'm just working within a regular view.</p>  <p>My end goal is to end up with something like this (where letters represent images):</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/XZpXf.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/XZpXf.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>And I need to know where to set the center for B &amp; C.</p>  <pre><code>let firstLabel = UILabel(frame: CGRectMake(12, 200, 50, 50)) let lastLabel = UILabel(frame: CGRectMake(250, 360, 50, 50)) </code></pre>
