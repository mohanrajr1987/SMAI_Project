<p>Navigation controllers have a stack of view controllers. So, let us say the stack looks like this:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>[Home, friends, highScores, Add, fullList]</p> </blockquote>  <p>Therefore I am currently on fullList, the top view Controller in the stack. Now if I do: </p>  <pre><code>var stack = navigationController!.viewControllers navigationController?.popToViewController(stack[1] as! UIViewController, animated: true) </code></pre>  <p>i.e I pop to the view Controller called friends, does it also pop the view Controllers called highScores and add aswell or leave those and skip down into the stack?</p>
