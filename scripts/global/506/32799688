It is discrete value (age is whole number) so I use scale_x_discrete to separate between bar. However, it look like that <img src="https://i.imgur.com/yFwxxDz.png" alt="discrete"><br> which have the space on left side.</p>  <p>If I use scale_x_continuous(), the left space will gone, but the separate between bar also gone too. <img src="https://i.imgur.com/xYWB9xF.png" alt="continue"> <br></p>  <p>I would like to get rid of the space on left side, from 0 to 13, but keep the separate between bar. Please show me how.</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>  <p><strong>My solution</strong>: <br> Thanked to @Gregor, this is my solution: <br></p>  <pre><code>raw_data$Age = factor(raw_data$Age) #convert Age column to factor qplot(x = Age, data = raw_data, geom = "histogram") + scale_x_discrete() </code></pre>  <p>Result: <br> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/5kS1v5r.png" alt="age_hist"></p>
