<p>Is there something like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3PISvNTeB0" rel="nofollow">PIX</a> for Android?</p>  <p>I'm using GameMaker Studio and I've got some texture swaps that only show up on Android.  As far as I know there's no reason why that should happen.  I'd like to analyze it and understand what's happening.  </p>
