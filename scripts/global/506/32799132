<p>I have three screens but non of my screens take DisplayPort, so i got a converter (niceEshop DisplayPort to HDMI - amazon) but im still to buy another hdmi. I know about the lack of support from 3 DVI protocol and I know that some converts work. So I wanted to test if the converter actually worked. So I plugged in my current HDMI TV into the converter and plugged the converter into the display port (only 2 monitors were used in this test, VGA and the converted displayport. Only the VGA monitor turned on. After clicking "Detect" on Windows it found the HDMI monitor but nothing was being displayed. I have never used DisplayPort and I would like to have 3 monitors up and running.</p>  <p>Graphics card: AMD R9 Radeon 270x (2GB version - MSI) Processor: AMD FX 4100 (getting a upgrade soon) RAM: 16GB</p>
