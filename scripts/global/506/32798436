<p>I'm making my own text editing component in java (for practice) and I stumbled upon a problem while implementing text selection.</p>  <p>After a while of debugging rectangle coloring for text selection I decided to just draw a simple rectangle somewhere random in my component, just to see a rectangle and I got this.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/RZZtX.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/RZZtX.png" alt="Checkout bottom corners"></a></p>  <p>Notice bottom corners. Left and bottom sides are crossing them by about a pixel. This rectangle was rendered with Graphics#drawRect(50, 50, 50, 50).</p>  <p>I'm probably missing something obvious. The code in question can be found here <a href="https://github.com/linaran/TextEditor/blob/master/src/main/TextEditor.java" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/linaran/TextEditor/blob/master/src/main/TextEditor.java</a> in the method paintCursor(Graphics g). Again this rectangle is rendered by one simple command drawRect(50, 50, 50, 50). How come the bottom corners are rendered incorrect?</p>
