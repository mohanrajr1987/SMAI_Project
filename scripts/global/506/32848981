<p>My field of study is Mathematics and I’m trying to understand the fundamentals of computer graphics, My teacher advised me to read <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1558604006" rel="nofollow">this</a> Book though he said that this book is old and may not contain the new results in computer graphics. So I’m asking for a new book that contains the fundamentals and maybe some practical examples too.</p>
