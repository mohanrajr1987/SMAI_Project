<p>I'm using graphics to recreate a state machine (like I'm showing <a href="http://i809.photobucket.com/albums/zz12/laura_bruges1/ej_zpsihdkfwiq.png" rel="nofollow">here</a>). What I'm trying to do is that if the user moves a state (A) and it overlaps another one (B), then A might not change its position.</p>  <p>At first I thought that I had to validate if the distance between the new location of A and the center of any other state doesn't exceed a certain value, then it could be moved. I use a HashMap to store the states and used Iterator to validate the position of each state. It worked, but the states started to move slower than before when I dragged the mouse.</p>  <p>Do you know any better way for doing that? Thanks for your help  </p>
