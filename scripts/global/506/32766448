<p>Can I create a virtually infinite number of instances of a class? Or can you tell me a better way to do this?</p>  <p>Here's my problem, I want to make a program that lets you create circles by clicking on the screen, they have to be displayed and to interact with one another. I'm pretty newbie, so I divided my project in some phases:</p>  <p>1 Display the form<br> 2 Display circles on click with diameter and color chosen by the user<br> 3 Make a separate class for single circles<br> 4 Make them move<br> 5 Make them interact with one another<br> 6 Check for bugs etc.</p>  <p>I'm stuck between point 2 and 3. I'm not sure that making a <code>Circle</code> class and creating various instances is the smartest way to do this, but it's the only way I came up with that gave me the possibility to make infinite circles displayed. I could use an array, since I think no one will ever use more than 20 circles at a time. What's more, I don't even think I'll ever publish this, since I'm making this just to learn something of graphics. so, sooner or later, I'll need help with point 4.</p>
