<p>I'm working on trying to create a key for a heatmap, but as far as I know, I cannot use the existing tools for adding a legend since I've generated the colors myself (I manually turn a scaled variable into rgb values for a short rainbow ( [255,0,0] to [0,0,255] ).</p>  <p>Basically, all I want to do is use the rightmost 10th of the screen to create a rectangle with these 10 colors: "#0000FF", "#0072FF", "#00E3FF", "#00FFAA", "#00FF38", "#39FF00", "#AAFF00", "#FFE200", "#FF7100", "#FF0000"</p>  <p>with three numerical labels - at 0, max/2, and max </p>  <p>In essence, I want to manually produce an object that looks like a rudimentary heatmap color key.</p>  <p>As far as I know, split.screen can only split the screen in half, which isn't what I'm looking for. I want the graphic I already know how to produce to take up the leftmost 90% of the screen, and I want this colored rectangle to take up the other 10%. </p>  <p>Thanks.</p>  <p>EDIT: I greatly appreciate the advice about the best way to the the plot - that said, I still would like to know the best way to do the task originally asked - creating the legend by hand; I already am able to produce the exact heatmap graphic that I'm looking for - the false coloring wasn't the only problem with ggplot that I was having - it was just the final factor convincing me to switch. I need a non ggplot solution.</p>  <p>EDIT #2: This is close to the solution I am looking for, except this only goes up to 10 instead of accepting a maximum value as a parameter (I will be running this code on multiple data-sets, all with different maximum values - I want the legend to reflect this). Additionally, if I change the size of the graph, the key falls apart into disconnected squares. </p>
