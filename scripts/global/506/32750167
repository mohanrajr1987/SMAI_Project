<p>I have an image that load a .PNG file and then combines it with other graphics I create. The thing is that I need to rotate only the .PNG file, not the whole thing. Picture a speedometer, you have a background image that goes from 0 to 200. That image remains static all the time. Now, on top of it, you have an arrow pointing to your current speed. That's the one I want to rotate.</p>  <p>This is what I have so far. It does display the graphics, but doesn't rotate the .PNG (the arrow)</p>  <pre><code>        Bitmap bitmap = new Bitmap(500, 280, PixelFormat.Format24bppRgb);         Graphics g = Graphics.FromImage(bitmap);         g.Clear(Color.White);          //this.Arrow = path to the .PNG         Image i = Image.FromFile(this.Arrow);         Bitmap a = new Bitmap(i.Width, i.Height);         Graphics ga = Graphics.FromImage(a);         a.SetResolution(ga.DpiX, ga.DpiY);          //It shouldn't rotate having the pivot at the (centre, centre)         //coordinates, but at the bottom of the image.          //The (21, 110) coordinates are right relative to the .PNG file         ga.TranslateTransform(21, 110);         ga.RotateTransform(45);   //&lt;--- Not rotating         ga.DrawImage(i, 0, 0);          g.DrawImage(i, new Rectangle(new Point(229, 120), new Size(i.Width, i.Height)));          g.DrawLine(new Pen(new SolidBrush(Color.Aquamarine), 1), 250, 0, 250, 280);         g.DrawLine(new Pen(new SolidBrush(Color.Aquamarine), 1), 0, 230, 500, 230); </code></pre>  <p>Any ideas?</p>
