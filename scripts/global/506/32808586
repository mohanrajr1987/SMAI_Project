<p>I am new to Android Studio so I need a little bit of help. I want to create a custom progress bar something like the gauge on the left side of this image: <a href="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/WDCUakUkVvY/maxresdefault.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i.ytimg.com/vi/WDCUakUkVvY/maxresdefault.jpg</a>. I've found this thread: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23237564/android-start-the-circular-progress-bar-from-top-270">Android: Start the circular progress bar from top (270&#176;)</a> but it's not quite what I am looking for. Is there something like creating my own shape or maybe it's doable by images? I can't figure that out. Thanks!</p>  <p>@EDIT I want to create a gauge like this one <a href="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/WDCUakUkVvY/maxresdefault.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i.ytimg.com/vi/WDCUakUkVvY/maxresdefault.jpg</a> . I've created a background with this white circle line and with the numbers next to it. Then in android studio I am trying create 2 progress bars. One as a circle and second as a line so I will be able to connect them so I will get this gauge shape. But the problem is I can't place it accurately to the background. On diffrent devices the progress bar is in diffrent position. What should I do ? </p>
