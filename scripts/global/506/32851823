<p>I'm currently creating a 2D game on Unity and I have a problem with images with gradients or transparency. Here for example, the beginning of one of my levels before importing it in Unity (PNG-8): <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/kFH47.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/kFH47.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Here when the image is imported into Unity: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/qI3Qr.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/qI3Qr.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>We can see that the gradation is very poorly managed by Unity. What are the ways to fix this problem?</p>
