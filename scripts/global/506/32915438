<p>I'm wondering what's the most efficient way of repainting in my case, and how to go about it.</p>  <p>I've got a <code>JFrame</code>, containing a <code>JPanel</code>. This <code>JPanel</code> contains a some AWT graphics. Some of these graphics are fixed, they don't move. Some other graphics (on top of the fixed graphics) in this panel do move. The layout is updated every 3 seconds. The fixed graphics require quite a bit of math to draw, so I probably don't want to repaint all graphics, but only the moving ones. </p>  <p>This is the possibilities I came up with:</p>  <ol> <li>To put the fixed graphics and the moving graphics in two separate panels and only repaint one panel, which are layed over each other.</li> <li>To add two different <code>Graphics</code> objects to the panel (one for fixed graphics and one for the moving) and only repaint one graphics object. (is this even possible?)</li> <li>Perhaps some other way I don't know?</li> </ol>
