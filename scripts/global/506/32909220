<p>I'm trying to use the glut framework to handle keypresses for a game I'm writing in c++. When a specific key is pressed, I want to start drawing a new curve and so I create a new curve and add it to my container of curves. However, when I use onKeyboard and debug I see that this function is called over and over when a key is pressed, not just on the initial press. Therefore, it's creating about 12 curves every time a key is pressed. My code for onKeyboard is below. Any help would be appreciated greatly!</p>  <pre><code>void onKeyboard(unsigned char key,int x, int y) {     keysPressed[key] = true;     switch (key) {             case 'l':                 curvesContainer.addCurve(new lCurve());                 break;             case 'p':                 curvesContainer.addCurve(new pCurve());      }     glutPostRedisplay(); } </code></pre>
