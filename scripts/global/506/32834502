<p>I'm new to programming and I'm teaching myself Java. </p>  <p>Currently I'm studying Ggraphics. Here is what I want to accomplish. I want to make 5 rows of 10 bricks lined up horizontally. I want to assign a different color for each row. (So there is a sequence of color--RED, YELLOW, GREEN) I am wondering if I could use setColor(nextColor()) and setSeed() to assign the particular sequence of color.</p>  <p><code>setColor()</code> and <code>nextColor()</code> are methods from <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/jtf/javadoc/student/acm/graphics/GOval.html" rel="nofollow">this package</a>. <code>setSeed</code> is a method from <a href="http://nifty.stanford.edu/2005/GridPlotter/GridPkgClassDocumentation/edu/kzoo/util/RandNumGenerator.html#setSeed%28long%29" rel="nofollow">this package</a>.</p>  <p>I want to know if anyone has an idea on how I can use <code>setSeed()</code> to help me create a sequence which could do something like this: <code> Red Red Red Red Yel Yel Yel Yel Grn Grn Grn Grn Red Red Red Red &lt;- sequence restarts here Yel Yel Yel Yel </code></p>
