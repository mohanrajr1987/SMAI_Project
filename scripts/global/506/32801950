<p>I'm trying to triangulate a non convex uniform point grid in 2D. I would need triangles only in the 8-neighborhood of each point. The problem is that when using vtkDelaunay2D I obtain triangles that violate this condition, resulting (in some configurations) in convex planar figures triangulations even if there exists a non convex triangulation.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/9hS94.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/9hS94.png" alt="The delaunay triangulation usually generates more triangles than necessary in this case, turning a non convex figure into a convex figure in many situations."></a>  </p>  <p>I can implement this kind of triangulation, but I do not want to reinvent the wheel. Which algorithm could I use to achieve this?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
