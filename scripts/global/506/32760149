<p>I'm giving a example that mirrors my usecase:  </p>  <p>I have a histogram say in the range <code>[0, 10000]</code>. I want to efficiently support queries of the type:  </p>  <pre><code>int j = maxYInXRange(20, 70); </code></pre>  <p>Which should return maximum <code>Y</code> value in the given <code>X</code> Range.</p>  <p>I've come across a Data structure called "Priority Search Tree" used in Computer Graphics but there are no easily understandable resources on this topic.</p>
