<p>So, I have written my first application in C# using VS 2008. It is a  winforms UI that launches a Fortran program to do a lot of number  crunching. </p>  <p>The Fortran program requires iteration and attempts to converge  to a solution. Convergence is not guaranteed, and the user can observe the  progress of the iteration via graphical presentations in the UI, developed  from data passed from the Fortran program in the form of text files. </p>  <p>After each iteration, the data in the files are inspected, the graphical  representation is updated, and each of the affected controls on the form is  individually updated with a call to, for example, thisControl.Refresh(). If  progress is not acceptable, the UI provides controls for interacting with  or terminating the Fortran code. </p>  <p>This all works well except for one annoying problem. The border of the form  showing the graphics flickers (i.e., temporarily changes from theme color to white and back to theme  color) with each iteration, which occurs very 1-2 seconds (can be longer or  shorter depending on the problem being solved). Furthermore, if you change  focus to another form, the border of that form begins to flicker in the  same manner. </p>  <p>If you minimize the original form, no flickering is observed,  but that defeats the purpose of that form. I have implemented double  buffering for the form, the form is not resizable, and no dragging of  graphics is performed. </p>  <p>I have checked several forums for a solution to my problem, but could not find anything related to my problem. Any ideas of how to eliminate the flickering would  be greatly appreciated.</p>
