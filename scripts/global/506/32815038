<p>Using <a href="http://zedgraph.sourceforge.net/documentation/html/N_ZedGraph.htm" rel="nofollow">Zedgraph</a> to plot values on two vertically stacked panes. On the upper pane, for relatively larger Y-axis values the axis gets shifted to the right as shown in figure. For smaller values Y-axis of both panes are aligned. How can the Y-axis of the lower pane also be shifted in tandem with the one above. Tried <strong>IsSynchronizeYAxes</strong> &amp; <strong>IsCommonScaleFactor</strong> property without success. Any sample code is greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8gI1Y.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8gI1Y.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
