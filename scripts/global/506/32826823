<p>Is there a way in three.js to project an object (in my case, a line geometry ellipse which shows the orbit of a spacecraft) onto another 3D object (the earth)? </p>  <p>I would assume there is, because this is how shadows are done in most graphics libraries, but most of what I've found is only projecting onto a flat surface like in this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32153295/how-to-project-a-3-d-object-onto-a-2-d-plane-in-three-js">post</a>. </p>
