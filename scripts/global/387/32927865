<p>Hoping someone can help. I have a list of hosts in a file, what I want to do is grab the hostname and insert that into a template using a here document in BASH.</p>  <p>The hosts file looks like this:</p>  <p><em>hosts.txt</em></p>  <pre><code>1.2.3.4 host1 5.6.7.8 host2 </code></pre>  <p>I then read this document with the following BASH:</p>  <pre><code>while read LINE; do   vmhost=$(echo "$LINE" | awk '{print $2}') done &lt; ./hosts.txt </code></pre>  <p>What I am looking to do with this is take each host (host1, host2) and insert that into a document, as follows:</p>  <pre><code>cat &gt; ./file &lt;&lt; EOF [master1] host1  [master2] host2  EOF </code></pre>  <p>If I put the here document into the while loop, it will write the last host in the loop under both master1 &amp; master2. </p>  <pre><code>cat &gt; ./file &lt;&lt; EOF  [master1] host2  [master2] host2  EOF </code></pre>  <p>How can I ensure that when I'm writing the variables in the while loop I get a unique entry under each heading?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
