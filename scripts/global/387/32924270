<p>I have a file that looks like this;</p>  <pre><code>"id","string" "10","john smith" "20","smith, john" </code></pre>  <p>On this I run <code>cut -d , -f 2</code>, which returns</p>  <pre><code>"john smith" "smith" </code></pre>  <p>In the second row, I want to return <code>"smith, john"</code>. Is there a solution to this using <code>cut</code> that ensures the specified delimiter is not treated as one when contained within a pair of double quotation marks?</p>
