<p>Here's what I'm trying to do:  I have a URL that displays a list of packages with version numbers at the end. I have three more URLs which each display a small portion of the same list of packages.  The goal is to be able to compare ONLY the packages that are in the latter three locations with the complete list in the first location, and check to see if the versions are the same.  If they're not, I'd like to return those lines that are different so we can see which packages we need to update.  In concept, I'm thinking something like </p>  <pre><code>diff *url1* (*url2, url3, url4*) </code></pre>  <p><strong>Output</strong></p>  <pre><code>package1-1.01 (&lt;-- returns package name that needs updating) </code></pre>  <p>Obviously, the syntax is wrong but I haven't found anything on diff that deals with URLs. Any ideas? </p>
