<p><strong><em>A SCRIPING/PROGRAMMING SOLUTION PLEASE!!! THE KEYBOARD ISSUE MAY AS WELL BE IRRELEVANT TO WHAT I WANT TO ACCOMPLISH.  I WANT TO ACTIVELY SEARCH FOR TYPED TEXT,AND REPLACE IT,THIS IS SIMPLE ENGLISH PEOPLE!!!</em></strong></p>  <p>Can someone please provide me with a simple programming/scripting solution to help fix my keyboard. (WITH EXAMPLES)</p>  <p>This is what happens if i type the ABC's and press enter after each letter.</p>  <pre><code>a b c3e d c3e f g h ,8i j k l m7u n .9o /0p z1q v4r s t m7u v4r x2w x2w y z1q </code></pre>  <p><strong><em>PLEASE DO NOT TRY TO HELP TROUBLESHOOT THE ISSUE,I HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING AND AM CONVINCED IT IS A HARDWARE PROBLEM.(keyboard got wet,or shorted somehow.)</em></strong></p>  <p>I tried a software solution called TyperTask: <a href="http://www.vtaskstudio.com/vista.pl?action=download&amp;link=typertask.exe" rel="nofollow">http://www.vtaskstudio.com/vista.pl?action=download&amp;link=typertask.exe</a> </p>  <p>Which seemed promising and does what i want it to do(or at least is supposed to) but half the time it doesnt work. Im thinking because the broken keys on my keyboard type them too fast,or all at once or something.IDK.</p>  <p>anyways,the way i was going to use that software was for example:</p>  <p>I press the "c" key and the keyboard types "c3e" , typer task was supposed to change it to "c" (but doesnt work half the time) A 2nd issue arises, both "c" and "e" type the same crap. So For "e" i set it "cc3e" to = "e" ((i would have to press "e" twice)) But it doesnt work for some reason.</p>  <p><strong><em>ANYWAYS...</em></strong></p>  <p>Is there a simple coding solution to actively search for all typed text in real time on any form or application for the above glitched texts and replace them with the correct letters?</p>
