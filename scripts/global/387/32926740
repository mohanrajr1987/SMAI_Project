<p>I'm new in linux and i'm building a program that receives the name of a process, gets its PID (i have no problem with that part) and then pass the PID to the kill command but its not working. It goes something like this: </p>  <pre><code>read -p "Process to kill: " proceso proid= pidof $proceso echo "$proid" kill $proid </code></pre>  <p>Can someone tell me why it isnt killing it ? I know that there are some otherways to do it, even with the PID, but none of them seems to work for me. I believe it's some kind of problem with the bash language (which I just started learning).</p>
