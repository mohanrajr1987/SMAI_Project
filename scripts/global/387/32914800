<p>I'm trying to set up a bash script that scans its root directory for new folders while also incrementing an int assigned to each folder by one daily. So that when the increment reaches 7 (after a week) it sends an email out (using Mutt) to notify someone of the folders that are over 7 days old in the root directory.</p>  <p>Here's what I have so far:</p>  <pre><code>#!/bin/bash  shopt -s extglob nullglob INPUT="file.csv" INPUT2="file2.csv" basedir="/Users/.../DeleteErrorTest"  # Omit any subdirectories, leave empty: omitdir= omitdir=  # Create array of all folders if [[ -z $omitdir ]]; then    cdarray=( "$basedir"/*/ ) else    cdarray=( "$basedir"/!($omitdir)/ ) fi  # Add directory to first column in csv file for ((i = 0; i &lt; ${#cdarray[@]}; i++)) do     printf '%s\n' "${cdarray[i]}"  done &gt; "$INPUT"  # add a daily incremented value awk -F "," '{$2=((numberOfDays++)) OFS $6; print}' "$INPUT" &gt; "$INPUT2"   # Checking for at least one directory: if ((${#cdarray[@]}&lt;=1)); then     printf 'No subdirectories found. Exiting.\n'     exit 0 fi </code></pre>  <p>I'm able to put folders into an array then write out to a .csv file. But I'm having trouble associating each element in the array with an int that increments everyday and then writing something that scans the directory for new folders without losing/copying over previous days folders. Hopefully that makes sense.</p>  <p>Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>
