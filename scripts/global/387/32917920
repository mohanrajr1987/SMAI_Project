<p>I am trying to read a file line by line and find the average of the numbers in each line.  I am getting the error: <code>expr: non-numeric argument</code></p>  <p>I have narrowed the problem down to sum=<code>expr $sum + $i</code>, but I'm not sure why the code doesn't work.</p>  <pre><code>while read -a rows do     for i in "${rows[@]}"     do         sum=`expr $sum + $i`         total=`expr $total + 1`     done     average=`expr $sum / $total` done &lt; $fileName </code></pre>  <p>The file looks like this (the numbers are separated by tabs):</p>  <pre><code>1       1       1       1       1 9       3       4       5       5 6       7       8       9       7 3       6       8       9       1 3       4       2       1       4 6       4       4       7       7 </code></pre>
