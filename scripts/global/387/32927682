<p>So I don't know scripting languages at all bare with me. I have a homework assignment where my professor provided the code for a script to execute.<br> I copy pasted it and when executing I'm getting this error:</p>  <pre><code> ./script2-57: line 9: 0  1+1: syntax error in expression (error token is "1+1") ./script2-57: line 9: 0  1+1: syntax error in expression (error token is "1+1") </code></pre>  <p>Here is the code for the script. Can anyone tell me how to fix it?  I know this is a quick fix that I could email my teacher about but it's due at midnight and he won't respond for days.</p>  <pre><code>#!/bin/bash if [ ! -f numbers ]; then     echo 0 &gt; numbers; fi count=0 while [ $count -ne 4000 ]; do     count=$((count+1)) n=$(tail -l numbers) echo "$(($n+1))"&gt;&gt;numbers done </code></pre>  <p>The run2 file is just  ./script2-57 &amp; ./script2-57</p>
