<p>This is a simple school project.  The console keeps stating [5:command not found</p>  <pre><code>#!/bin/bash  num=28 echo "Guess a number a number between 1 and 100" read guess  while [$guess -ne $num] do   if [$guess -lt $num]  then      echo "number is higher"  elif [$guess -gt $num]  then      echo "number is lower"   else      echo "Correct! The number is $number"   fi  done </code></pre>
