<p>I'm a new user that is trying to learn bash, so I'm sorry if my code really bad or "stupid" because I learn bash from free pdf only. My question is: I have a file called "number" that's simply contains</p>  <p>1     3     4     2     9</p>  <p>I want to read it and sum them all together, however my code doesn't work. What I have so far is:</p>  <pre><code>line=$(head -n 1 number) echo "line" while read $line do   sum=`expr $sum + $line`   echo sum done </code></pre>  <p>Can someone help me to show the correct code? Also, when I call $line is it "1 3 4 2 9" or they split already become "1" "3" "4" "2" "9"?</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
