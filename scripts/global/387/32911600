<p>I am working on monitoring scripts for linux (ubuntu) hosts, I currently have 2 check CPU usage scripts and I want to know if there is a way to run a script (.sh or .rb file) and capture how much CPU/mem it required so that I can compare them and decide which one to run on my machines... How can I do this?!  I know you can get the stats based on PID but the script is processed so fast that I cant get accurate stats with that method..  Thanks!!! </p>
