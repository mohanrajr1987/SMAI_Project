<p>Issue: Start the Adaptec Utility in terminal and blink the second hard drive light. Sleep and submit a keystroke to end the blink.</p>  <pre><code>&gt; arcconf identify 1 device 0 1 Controllers found: 1 The specified device is blinking. Press any key to stop the blinking. </code></pre>  <p>Command: arcconf identify 1 device 0 1</p>  <p>Here are some commands I have tried.</p>  <p>1.) <code>echo -ne '\n' | arcconf identify 1 device 0 1</code></p>  <p>Result: Starts the program and immediately submits an 'enter'. The utility is stopped before the drive can blink; I'm not sure how to add sleep here.</p>  <p>2.) <code>kill -9 8309</code></p>  <p>Result: Kills the arcconf process, however, even with the process terminated the drive will forever blink.</p>  <p>3.) <code>echo -ne '\n' &gt; /proc/8309/fd/0</code></p>  <p>Result: Sends an 'enter' to the process, however, this only prints new lines to the terminal running arcconf and doesn't actually submit a keystroke. Same result with echo "abcd".</p>  <p>How can I start this utility in bash, sleep, and send a keystroke to stop the utility?</p>
