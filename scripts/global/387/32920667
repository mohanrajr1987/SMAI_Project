<p>Suppose we have a log file like marks.log and the content looks something like this:</p>  <pre><code>Fname   Lname   Net Algo     Jack    Miller  15  20   John    Compton 12  20   Susan   Wilson  13  19   </code></pre>  <p>I want to add a new column that contains average for each person, and a new row that contains average for each course. The result has to look like this:</p>  <pre><code>Fname   Lname   Net  Algo  Avg Jack    Miller  15   20    17.5 John    Compton 12   20    16 Susan   Wilson  13   19    16 Average         13.3 19.6  - </code></pre>
