<p>Supposed I have directory structure like </p>  <pre><code>src/ src/a/ src/a/1.ocf   src/a/1.pdf   src/a/1.txt src/b/ src/b/2.ocf src/b/2.pdf src/b/2.xls src/c/ src/c/3.doc src/c/3.ocf src/c/3.txt src/d/ </code></pre>  <p>Then, I just want to synchronize only files with extension *.txt.  So, I tried to use command like:</p>  <pre><code>#rsync -avvH --include="*/" --include="*.txt" --exclude="*" src/ dst/ sending incremental file list ./ a/ a/1.txt b/ c/ c/3.txt d/ </code></pre>  <p>Unfortunately, this command not only synchronize *.txt file but also all directory. I don't want directory 'b' and 'd' be synchronized because it not contain file *.txt</p>  <p>Is there simple way to do that?  </p>
