<p>I'm trying to draw 2D filled circles using OpenGL shaders with "#version 120" in C++.</p>  <p>I saw many tutorials to do that, but they all for versions of shaders greater then 120 (which isn't work on my laptop) and i have no expierence to modify them correctly.</p>  <p>My goal is set up buffer(s) with circles coords, their radiuses and colors and call shader program to draw all of that.</p>  <p>Maybe somebody have pieces of code of these old shaders that can help me.</p>  <p>Thank you in advance!</p>
