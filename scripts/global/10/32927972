<p>I have a conceptual question to help me as a fairly novice C++ programmer. What is the advantage, if any, of C++ allowing mixing, or "co-mingling", of declarations and executables? As I beginner, all I can think of is that this is not a feature available in C. And obviously, you can combine some lines of code by not having to declare variables at the beginning of a particular scope, but rather you could declare in the instruction itself. Wish I had more to tell you all but I really do not know. Maybe a push in the right direction would help! Thanks!</p>
