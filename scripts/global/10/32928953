<p>I understand I'm not looking for someone to build the program for me but unfortunately I have not had experience coding in awhile and this type of program is a little daunting for me. If someone is willing to take the time and help me explain whats required for it, I appreciate it. I have found similar programs here but it's not what I need it to do.  For this program to begins it has two requirements, taking the input as a command on a single line beginning with <strong>cmd></strong> or using a supplied CSV file that will be very similar to this. </p>  <pre><code>node,add,A, node,add,B, node,add,C, node,add,D, node,add,B, edge,add,A,B edge,add,A,E edge,add,A,D edge,add,A,B edge,add,B,C print,matrix,, print,list,, edge,add,A,A edge,delete,C,B node,delete,A, node,search,D, node,search,A, print,matrix,, print,list,, </code></pre>  <p>In the CSV file usage I would need to ignore commas when applying it to the graph. I am also wanting to use an adjacency matrix for this program. As listen above I need to be able to add nodes &amp; edges, delete them, and search for them.</p>  <p>The final graph should also have this format.</p>  <pre><code> A B C D E A0 1 0 1 1 B1 0 1 1 0 C0 1 0 0 0 D1 0 0 0 0 E1 0 0 0 0 </code></pre>  <p>the program similar that I found is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19200003/adjacency-matrix-in-c">Here</a></p>
