<p>I'm probably going to confuse myself while writing this, sorry in advance:</p>  <p>Is there a way I can access a location in a dynamic array(increment an array pointer) of pointers using the <code>sizeof()</code> the object that is in the array?</p>  <p>For example: I have an dynamic array of type base class Student populated with derived class objects(Graduate, Undergraduate).</p>  <p>Due to this I can't just step through my array in the normal fashion to display information because the actual objects Graduate and Undergraduate are different sizes than Student. Each array step will move <code>sizeof(Student)</code> when the actual objects are larger. </p>  <p>Depending on the type of student I am doing(this is for Graduate):</p>  <pre><code>Student *student = new Graduate(undergrad, fName, lName, major, idNum, arr2, cSize,          degreeType, thesis); arr[i] = student; </code></pre>  <p>Where <code>arr</code> was declared: <code>Student *arr = new Student[size];</code></p>  <p>Using my array I had created this in a for loop:</p>  <pre><code>if (!students[i].getGradStatus()){     handleGraduate(&amp;students[i], i);     step = step + sizeof(Graduate); } else if (students[i].getGradStatus()){     handleUndergraduate(&amp;students[i], i);     step = step + sizeof(Undergraduate); } </code></pre>  <p>I was trying to come up with a way to change the step size. I don't think this will work with a for loop but a while loop may be different. Pretty much I'm trying to go something similar to a file <code>seekg()</code> but manually on an array. </p>  <p>And as I've noticed everyone likes to question the use of dynamic arrays over vectors so let me just say I cannot use vectors on this project(No STL is allowed :( ). And I have to use Polymorphism, thus why I have an array pointer of type Student holding derived class objects.</p>
