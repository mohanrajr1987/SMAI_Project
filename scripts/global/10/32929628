<p>I have a pretty standard .l file for <code>flex</code> to to process.</p>  <p><strong>scanner.l</strong></p>  <pre><code>%{ #include "sFile.h" %}  %% "BEGIN"         return BG; "END"           return END; "And so on...." %%  int yywrap() {      return 1 } </code></pre>  <p>So I hit this with a <code>flex -+ scanner.l</code> and like magic a <code>lex.yy.cc</code> file shows up.</p>  <p>I turn to my trusty c++ compiler and <code>g++ lex.yy.cc</code> just to give it a go and I get </p>  <pre><code>lex.yy.cc: In member function 'virtual int yyFlexLexer::yylex()': lex.yy.cc:868: error: 'yywrap' was not declared in this scope lex.yy.cc: In member function 'int yyFlexLexer::yyinput()': lex.yy.cc:1271: error: 'yywrap' was not declared in this scope </code></pre>  <p>I've also tried modifying the <code>scanner.l</code> to use <code>%option c++</code> and a few other things but I can't for the life of me figure out how to get this thing to compile.</p>  <p>The end result is is using this with an external .cpp file to do some other work for the assignment.</p>  <p>edit: Versions g++ 4.1.1 flex 2.5.33</p>
