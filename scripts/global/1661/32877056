<p>I have an object to run all my database queries and in that object I have a method called <code>runQuery()</code> that is called for any type of query.  </p>  <p>This is just an illustration code:</p>  <pre><code>public function runQuery($query){     $stmt-&gt;prepare($query);     $stmt-&gt;execute();      return $stmt-&gt;fetchAll(); } </code></pre>  <p>My problem is that when I run <code>$stmt-&gt;errorCode();</code> to see if everything went fine I receive the error code: HY000</p>  <p>After some search I discovered that this error is triggered everytime I do a <code>fetchAll()</code> on queries that have nothing to fetch like <code>INSERT INTO</code>, <code>UPDATE</code> or <code>DELETE</code>.  </p>  <p>My question is, how can I verify if the executed query has content to fetch or not without exploding the query to see if the first word is not one of those three?</p>
