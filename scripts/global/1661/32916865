<p>I’m getting a fatal error that references <code>SQLSTATE[HY000] [2002] No such file or directory</code> when activating a WordPress plugin that I’m currently developing. The error occurs when a PHP script in the plugin (<code>import_data.php</code>) attempts to connect to a database (not the WordPress DB) using PDO.</p>  <p>However, if I run the script in Terminal, like this:</p>  <p><code>/usr/bin/php /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/mysite/wp-content/plugins/data_import/import_data.php</code></p>  <p>it runs exactly as it should. Because of this, I'm not thinking this is not a problem with code but rather configuration.</p>  <p>I’d like to know in general how to troubleshoot this. I’m wondering if PHP is connecting to MySQL via a different socket (or something?) when run from Terminal vs. when run from WordPress (and that’s why it can’t connect)? I have tried increasing <code>WP_MEMORY_LIMIT</code> and <code>WP_MAX_MEMORY_LIMIT</code> in <code>wp-config.php</code> but not luck. I also thought it could be an issue with my localhost settings so I did a complete re-install. Didn’t work either. I’m not an expert on PDO or MySQL/PHP server configuration. But any tips on how to get this resolved are appreciated!</p>  <p>Note: <code>import_data.php</code> does pull in a lot of data, so in order to get the script to work on localhost, I had to increase MySQL <code>max_allowed_packet</code> to <code>32M</code>. I’m running my localhost on MAMP for OSX.</p>
