<p>I have a PG database containing multiple schemas.</p>  <p>I have a symfony2 application which need to connect to only one of them.</p>  <p>If I don't configure anything, by default Doctrine2 searches in all the schemas so it try to make <code>SELECT</code> on table where it haven't the right.</p>  <p>I followed this answer : <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10654651/symfony2-doctrine2postgresql-setting-a-schema">symfony2 + doctrine2@postgresql setting a schema</a></p>  <p>Now it seems to go only in the shema I specified but it is still looking for some tables no present in my schema but in other ones.</p>  <p>When I execute something ldoctrine:migrations:diff</p>  <pre><code>[Doctrine\DBAL\DBALException]                                                                        An exception occurred while executing 'SELECT min_value, increment_by FROM "pgstatspacknameid"':     SQLSTATE[42P01]: Undefined table: 7 ERROR:  relation "pgstatspacknameid" does not exist              LINE 1: SELECT min_value, increment_by FROM "pgstatspacknameid"                                                                                  ^                                                         [PDOException]                                                                              SQLSTATE[42P01]: Undefined table: 7 ERROR:  relation "pgstatspacknameid" does not exist     LINE 1: SELECT min_value, increment_by FROM "pgstatspacknameid"                                                                         ^       </code></pre>  <p>So following the doctrine migration documentation, I added this line in the connection configuration : </p>  <pre><code>        schema_filter: ~^(?!pgstats)~ </code></pre>  <p>It still always try to make <code>SELECT</code> in those tables...</p>
