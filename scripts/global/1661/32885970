<p>As you probably all know, not connecting to mysql on localhost or 127.0.0.1 is slow when connecting to another servers ip, because of network configuration and other things. I posted this question to ask how I can spee dup connecting to mysql on a different server faster, it currently takes more than a whole second to connect to mysql using my pdo in php shown below</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php $config = require_once $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . '/include/config.php';  // PDO Connection try {     $dns = "mysql:host=".$config['database']['host'].";dbname=".$config['database']['name']."";     $pdo = new PDO($dns, $config['database']['username'], $config['database']['password']);     $pdo-&gt;setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION); } catch (PDOException $ex) {     exit('Unable to connect to the master database!'); } ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>When using 127.0.0.1 it took not even 100 milleseconds, is there a way to get it back to that state, when connecting to mysql on another server? I use mysql on another server due to ddos attacks on my main server and the risk of data loss.</p>
