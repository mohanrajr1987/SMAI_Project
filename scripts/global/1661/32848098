<p>I have a table of customer orders: inside are zero cost orders (things I have given away to customers) as well as paid orders. I want to find out how many customers who have received a free order have also purchased an order.</p>  <pre><code>    SELECT customer_id         FROM orders         WHERE total = 0         GROUP BY customer_id      SELECT customer_id         FROM orders         WHERE total != 0         GROUP BY customer_id </code></pre>  <p>These two queries give me a list of customers who received a free order and a list of customers who paid for an order. I want to count the overlapping instances, for example:</p>  <pre><code>//free orders 1,5,2,9,3,11,7 //paid orders 1,5,4,8,7,9,3,12,10,13 </code></pre>  <p>The intersect between these two sets is <code>{1,5,9,3,7}</code>, which is five element. I need a way to do this strictly using SQL preferred.</p>
