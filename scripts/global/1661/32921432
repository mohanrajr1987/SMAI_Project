<p>There is a lot of confusion while learning programming. You spend days understanding one way and then learn actually it is being deprecated or unsafe, so I want to find the right way and currently in PDO prepared statements. I have got few codes below for inserting data into database, all of them are PDO prepared statements but slightly different, So I want to know which is the best way and give at least one reason to support your way. </p>  <p>First method.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php $stmt = $dbh-&gt;prepare("insert into registered(name, email, password) values (?,?,?)");  $stmt-&gt;bindParam(1, $name); $stmt-&gt;bindParam(2, $email); $stmt-&gt;bindParam(3, $pwd);  $name = $_POST["fname"]; $email = $_POST["email"]; $pwd = $_POST["pwd"];  $stmt-&gt;execute(); echo "&lt;p&gt;Thank you for registering!&lt;/p&gt;"; ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Second method.</p>  <pre><code> $sql = "INSERT INTO users ( username, password, first_name, surname, address, email ) VALUES   ( :username, :password, :first_name, :surname, :address, :email )";  $query = $db-&gt;prepare( $sql );  $query-&gt;execute( array( ':username'=&gt;$username, ':password'=&gt;$password, ':first_name'=&gt;$first_name, ':surname'=&gt;$surname, ':address'=&gt;$address, ':email'=&gt;$email ) ); </code></pre>  <p>Third method.</p>  <pre><code>$sql = "INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES (:username, :password)"; $stmt = $pdo-&gt;prepare($sql);  //Bind our variables. $stmt-&gt;bindValue(':username', $username); $stmt-&gt;bindValue(':password', $passwordHash);  //Execute the statement and insert the new account. $result = $stmt-&gt;execute(); </code></pre>  <p>No doubt these codes entirely seem the same like <code>bindValue</code> and <code>bindParam</code> is used in method one and two, also in method two and three values are added on the same insert line whereas method one uses placeholders, so what is the best way, using placeholders seems to be tricky for beginners.</p>
