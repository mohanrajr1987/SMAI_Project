<p>I have recently moved a large php application from using <code>mssql_</code> functions to the PDO function using the mssql driver.</p>  <p>I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/tobya/pdo_sql_functions" rel="nofollow">simple library</a> that allows drop in replacement.  It all seems to work pretty well considering.</p>  <p>However one  thing that is a bit annoying is default format of numbers and  particularly numbers defined as money in the database.</p>  <p>Most of my smarty template pages previous simply output the number as it came from the database so someones balance might be show as</p>  <pre><code>125.00 </code></pre>  <p>however since changing to PDO this is returned as</p>  <pre><code>125.0000 </code></pre>  <p>This is a little annoying and off putting, but obviously not the end of the world.</p>  <p>My Question.  Is there a workaround / trick / formatting Constant or method that I can use to get PDO to format values differently, or do I need to go an manually set the format for every number in every template throughout my app?</p>
