<p>I've been staring at code for hours trying to see what I'm missing.  Maybe someone can point me in the right direction.</p>  <p>First I have a database with multiple tables.  One for images that stores the location and details of products.  I've built pages that let me view, edit and add products.  This all works great.</p>  <p>I'm now trying to do something simple and its not working.  I created a table "Contacts" in the database and added the rows "name, street, city, zip, phone, email".  I have populated this table with test data.</p>  <p>I'm trying to get my page to read the data and display it on the screen. I had wrote a complete page of html and screwed around with it trying to get it to work.  after getting frustrated I resorted to a very simple php script below.  I keep getting SQL error "Notice: Undefined index: name in C:\wamp\www\woody\Admin\index.php on line 38"   I know the first index is called "name" I have also attempted to replace "$results['name']" with "$results['0']" and "$results['1']".  Nothing seems to work. Anyone see what my tired eyes are missing?</p>  <pre><code>&lt;body&gt;  &lt;?php     require_once("../includes/db.php");  $sql = "SELECT * FROM contact"; $query = $conn-&gt;prepare( $sql ); $query-&gt;execute(); $results = $query-&gt;fetchAll( PDO::FETCH_ASSOC );           echo htmlentities($results['name']);   ?&gt;         &lt;!-- jQuery (necessary for Bootstrap's JavaScript plugins) --&gt; &lt;script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.3/jquery.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;!-- Include all compiled plugins (below), or include individual files as needed --&gt; &lt;script src="js/bootstrap.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;   </code></pre>  <p></p>
