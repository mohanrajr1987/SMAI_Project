<p>I am trying to migrate code from PEAR::MDB2 to the more standard PDO.  MDB2 has a specific Manager feature for accessing the database schema which PDO does not.  All of the posts that I have found about this all give solutions only for MySQL.  But the primary reason to use PDO is to avoid a database server specific implementation.  I appreciate that there is an enormous amount of variability between implementations and that some implementations may not provide any useful information.</p>
