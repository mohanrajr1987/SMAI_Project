<p>I am trying to connect MS SQL Server 2012 with php. My OS is Linux Red Hat and I am using PHP 5.5.7 version. This is my connection function:</p>  <pre><code>    function connect_ms_sql() {     try {         $hostname = "xxx";         $port = 111;         $dbname = "xxx";         $username = "xxx";         $pw = "xxx";         $dbh = new PDO ("dblib:host=$hostname:$port;dbname=$dbname", "$username", "$pw");     } catch (PDOException $e) {         echo "Failed to get DB handle: " . $e-&gt;getMessage() . "\n";         exit;     }     unset($dbh); } </code></pre>  <p>When I run this function, it shows me error: <code>Failed to get DB handle: could not find driver</code>. How I can fix it? I tried with FreeTDS, same error. Please help me!</p>
