<p>I have a simple example query:</p>  <pre><code>$prepare = $this-&gt;pdo-&gt;prepare('SELECT user, pass FROM user_table WHERE id = ?'); </code></pre>  <p>Ok. I need execute this:</p>  <pre><code>if(count($prepare-&gt;fetchAll()) &gt; 0){    $user = $prepare-&gt;fetch(); } </code></pre>  <p>I need to run two fetch. But when running <code>count</code>, <code>fetch</code> in the  <code>if-condition</code> is empty. Something like i could not perform two fetch in the same time ...<br> Has anyone had this issue and found a solution?</p>  <p>Hugs!</p>
