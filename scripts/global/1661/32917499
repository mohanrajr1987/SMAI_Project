<p>I am using PDO to access my data base and am looping using two while loops with fetch at the same time, seen below:</p>  <pre><code>$DBH = new PDO('mysql:host=localhost;dbname=database;charset=utf8',$dblogin,$dbpass); $sql = 'SELECT * FROM table'; $STH = $DBH-&gt;prepare($sql); $STH-&gt;execute();  while ($bm_table = $STH-&gt;fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC)) {  //SQL Query $sql1 = 'QUERY HERE'; $STH1 = $DBH-&gt;prepare($sql1); $STH1-&gt;execute();  //Loops through using different handle, but what if I used STH again? while ($row = $STH1-&gt;fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC)) {     SomeFunction($bm_table,$row);  } } </code></pre>  <p>As you can see above I am using a different statement handle (STH, STH1 etc.) Is this necessary? Or can I use just one statement handle for everything. The reason I have used multiple handles is as the $bm_table value that uses STH, will still be in use while I am fetching $row wouldn't that change the value of $bm_table or stop the fetch from working? How does the handles with PDO work? Especially when in this case I have two simultaneous fetch loops running at the same time using the same PDO connection. </p>  <p>So the main thing I am looking for here is if I have two statements that are running simultaneously is it important that I used different handles? But I can continue to use the same connection? </p>  <p>Thanks,</p>
