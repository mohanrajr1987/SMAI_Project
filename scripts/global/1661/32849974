<p>I have a MySQL database with a table called product. Columns are id, product_name, price, category. I use PDO with fetchAll and sort by category. I would like to create HTML tables for each category grouping. In the past I've always done something like this:</p>  <pre><code>$category = ""; $html = ""; foreach($results as $row){     if ($row['category'] != $category){         if ($category != "")             $html .= "&lt;/table&gt;";         $category = $row['category'];         $html .= "&lt;table&gt;";      }      //code for table row here } $html .= "&lt;/table&gt;"; </code></pre>  <p>However, I am wondering if there is a different way to do this such as splitting an array by categories and running a foreach on each sub-array. Is this possible?</p>  <p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>  <p>To explain further, I am looking for something that is not as cumbersome. I prefer not having to check what the previous category was (or if it was empty). I prefer not having to specify a closing <code>&lt;/table&gt;</code> tag twice. If an array can be split by category then this would get around these issues by just running a nested loop on each of the categories.</p>  <p><strong>Edit 2:</strong></p>  <p>For some reason this question was listed as opinion based. Can someone inform me as to what is opinion based about my question? I will then try to improve it.</p>
