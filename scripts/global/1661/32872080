<p>I request your support as I'm honestly trying to properly create an inventory of computer equipment . Table "devices" serial number , mark, model . Table "users" : name, email , area. It requires the CRUD , as well as all the history . Likewise who generates the change through login and password . also I have a small room where the devices will go in when user left and take for new users, I need to report en every moment what is in the small room. The language I use is PHP and MySQL, but what I require is to understand the problem fully because I don’t know how to make it  properly, what pages to create, as how I will relate the tables. I do not require language but a guide to the whole problem because is easy to learn the language  but I don’t have the idea clearfully, in special when I attack the problem it grows insanely.</p>
