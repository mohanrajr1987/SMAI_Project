<ol> <li><p>First problem: I'm getting an error when I'm using route without index.php:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The requested URL /auth/login was not found on this server. </p> </blockquote>  <p>I found that this error may appear when <code>mod_rewrite</code> isn't set, but it is.</p></li> <li><p>Second problem is PDO error: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>PDOException in Connector.php line 50:   SQLSTATE[HY000] [2005] Unknown MySQL server host 'localhost:3306' (2)</p> </blockquote>  <p>I found that this may appear because <code>DB_HOST</code> is set to 'localhost:3306' on PHP 5.5 and higher, but it's set 'localhost'</p></li> </ol>
