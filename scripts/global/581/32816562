<p>I am trying to write a program that will group all anagrams in a list together, and the output has to be sorted alphabetically. I already have a program to sort the input alphabetically which does it in O(nlog(n)) time using heapsort. My program also groups the anagrams, however it is too slow. I believe using hashing will give an efficient algorithm but not quite sure how to implement it. Does anyone have any suggestions for an efficient algorithm to complete this task?</p>  <p>eg. </p>  <p>Input:</p>  <pre><code>eat tea tan ate nat bat </code></pre>  <p>Output:</p>  <pre><code>ate eat tea  bat  nat tan </code></pre>
