<p>I started to use Codeigniter framework and in their new release doc's they say</p>  <p>DO NOT use this or any other encryption library for user password storage! Passwords must be hashed instead, and you should do that via PHPâ€™s own Password Hashing extension.</p>  <p>The problem is that I use PHP 5.3 and that extension requires 5.5</p>  <p>What should i use for hashing in PHP 5.3?</p>
