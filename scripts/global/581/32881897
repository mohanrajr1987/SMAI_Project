<pre><code>h1 = { "a" =&gt; 100, "b" =&gt; 200 } h2 = { "b" =&gt; 254, "c" =&gt; 300 } h1.merge(h2) do |key, old, new|   new - old end </code></pre>  <p>How does this code work? Why are there three variables (<code>key, old, new</code>), and where are they pointing to? How can <code>old</code> be subtracted from <code>new</code> when <code>new</code> and <code>old</code> were not defined?</p>
