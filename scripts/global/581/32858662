<p>i have stored a key in the database and encrypted with md5 + salt. Now i want to add it to a string witch has to be hashed.</p>  <p>if i try it like this it works of course:</p>  <pre><code>$key = "1111"; $string = sha1($string.$key); </code></pre>  <p>but is it possible to do something like?</p>  <pre><code>$key = crypt($keyFromDatabase, $salt); $string = sha1($string.$key); </code></pre>  <p>i know that md5 can't be decrypted in a string and i read that it makes no sense to encrypted twice.</p>  <p>thanks!</p>
