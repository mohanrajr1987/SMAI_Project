<p>I want to modify an array which is located inside a hash in perl. However, I can't seem to pass by reference here. <strike>If the array is not inside a hash, it works fine.</strike> Here is my code:</p>  <pre><code>%hash = (     array1 =&gt; ['foo', 2, 'bar']  ); print @{$hash{array1}}, "\n"; changeArray($hash{array1}); print @{$hash{array1}}, "\n";   sub changeArray {     @array = @{$_[0]};     $array[0] = "not foo"; } </code></pre>  <p>Output:</p>  <pre><code>$ ./scrap.pl foo2bar foo2bar </code></pre>  <p>Isn't <code>$hash{array1}</code> the reference to the anonymous array ['foo',2,'bar']? </p>
