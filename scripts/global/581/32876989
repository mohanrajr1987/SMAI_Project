<p>I need to process real customer data but due to obvious privacy reasons, I would need to convert the real data to fake data but of same type. i.e. a real phone number to a random phone number,  real SSN to random SSN. </p>  <p>I plan to use the python library faker to generate the fake data and maintain a map of real data to fake data to make sure I don't generate two different fake values for one real user value in a given run. The problem is that I will have to persist this map to make sure that future runs of my tool would produce same hash data for the same user data. I have a problem with that. Is there a better way where the hash algorithm provides a fake ssn for a real ssn and always returns the same output for a given input ?</p>
