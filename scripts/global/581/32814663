<pre><code>    my %seen;     @seen{@sender} = ();     my @merged = (@sender, grep{!exists $seen{$_}} @receiver);       my $c1 = @merged;     print $c1, "\n";       @hash{@merged} = ();     my @email = keys %hash;      my $c2 = @email;      print $c2, "\n"; </code></pre>  <p>This is the part of code that I wrote for the purpose in the title.</p>  <p>c1 prints 1409 while c2 prints only 493. I want to know where went wrong that almost 1000 elements are missing (not in the key for the hash)?</p>  <p>Alternatively, if I do this:</p>  <pre><code>    foreach (@merged) {         $hash{$_} = ();     }     # @hash{@merged} = ();     my @email = keys %hash; </code></pre>  <p>to assign keys, it still only gives me 493 keys, missing almost 1000 others.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
