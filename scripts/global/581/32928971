<p>I know that PHP 5.5's new hashing function doesn't have to use a user-specified salt, but would it increase security? I've been doing a bit of reading and from what I understand, the hashing function uses a random salt each time which it can retrieve from the hash value when it comes time to verify a hash. But would there be any advantage at all to generating your own salts and using them? Any detriment?</p>
