<p>I am not very experienced and am trying to handle collisions in my hash table. However, it just skips over it and doesn't write it at all. I figured the while loop with the conditional if would take care of it... I have been playing around with it for a while now and feel like I am mixing everything up or losing my mind. </p>  <pre><code>    File file = new File("info.txt");     try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file))) {         String line;           while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {              temp = nhash.hashing(line,maxSize);             System.out.println(line + " " + " Hash key: " + temp);              int loc = (int)temp;             if(arr[loc] != null)       // I FIGURED THIS WOULD SOLVE it             {                          // THE ISSUE... But IT DOESN'T                 while(arr[loc] != null) {               //  System.out.println("Collision at [" + loc + "] with Data Item : [" + arr[loc] + "]");                     loc++;                     if(loc == maxSize)                         loc = 0;                 }             }else {                 arr[loc] = line;              //   System.out.println("Data Item[" + line + "] Stored in index [" + loc + "] of array.");                 key[j] = loc;                 j++;             }         } </code></pre>
