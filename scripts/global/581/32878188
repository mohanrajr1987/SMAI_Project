<p>If I have a very simple 8-letter password scheme that can contains a-z, A-Z, and 0-9, I can have a possible combination of 62^8 passwords. </p>  <p>Assuming that each password is 8 bytes, the total amount of space I need to store 62^8 passwords would be 8 * 62^8 bytes.</p>  <p>However, I decided to encrypt the password, I can use a simple SHA-256 algorithm on all the passwords, and encrypt them to 32 bytes passwords. Now the space of all the encrypted passwords is 32 * 62^8 bytes.</p>  <p>If I were to make a hash table mapping each encrypted password to the plaintext password, how should I go about figuring out the size?</p>  <p>Since the Hash Table contains both encrypted(key) and plaintext(value), I'm thinking that the size is something like <strong>62^8 * (8 + 32)</strong>, but I'm not sure if my reasoning is correct or not. </p>
