<p>This is the hash I have:</p>  <pre><code>color_hash = { sky: "blue", curtain: "blue", pavement: "black" } </code></pre>  <p>Is there a way to change it to make two keys map to the same result, something like this:</p>  <pre><code>color_hash = { sky or curtain: "blue", pavement: "black" } </code></pre>  <p>I want to be able to use <code>color_hash[:sky]</code> and it would print <code>blue</code>, and I could use <code>color_hash[:curtain]</code> and it would print <code>blue</code>.</p>
