<p>Does the HTTP/WebDav spec allow this client-server dialog?</p>  <ol> <li>client: I want to PUT data to /user1/foo.mkv which has this hash sum: HASH</li> <li>server: OK, PUT was successful, you don't need to send the data since I already know the data with this hash sum.</li> </ol>  <p>Note: This PUT is an initial upload. It is not an update.</p>  <p>If this is possible, a way faster file syncing could be implemented.</p>  <p>Use case: The WebDAV server hosts a directory for each user. The favorite video foo.mkv gets uploaded by several users. In this example the favorite video is already stored at this location: /user2/myfoo.mkv. The second and following uploads don't need to send any data, since the server already knows the content. This would reduce a lot of network load.</p>  <p>Preconditions:</p>  <ul> <li>Client and server would need to agree on the hash algorithm beforehand.</li> <li>The server needs to store the hash-value of already known files.</li> </ul>  <p>It would be very easy to implement this in a custom client and server. But that's not what I want.</p>  <p>My question: Is there an RFC or other standard that allows such a dialog?</p>  <p>If there is no standard yet, then how to proceed to get this dream come true? </p>  <p><strong>Security consideration</strong></p>  <p>With the above dialog it would be able to access the content of know hashes. Example an evil client knows that there is a file with the hash sum of <code>1234567...</code>. He could do the above two steps and after that the client could use a GET to download the data.  </p>  <p>A way around this to extend the dialog:</p>  <ol> <li>client: I want to PUT data which has this hash sum: HASH</li> <li>server: OK, PUT would be successful, but to be sure that you have the data, please send me the bytes N up to M. I need this to be sure you have the hash-sum <strong>and</strong> the data.</li> <li>client: Bytes N up to M of the data are <code>abcde...</code></li> <li>server: OK, your bytes match mine. I trust you. Upload successful, you don't need to send the data any more.</li> </ol>
