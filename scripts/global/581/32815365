<p>For example, first, I have identified several key words. Then, in another file, I want to find lines that matches these key words exactly.</p>  <p>Using loop, I would loop through the file for each key word. So if there are 10 key words, I would loop the file 10 times. But if the file is huge, this method would be very time inefficient. </p>  <p>I heard proper use of hash could ease such a situation but never saw an example. So exactly how to use hash to achieve the same goal while using loop only once? Could you provide an example?</p>
