<p>I need to regularly check many (100.000's) rows and check if their current state is the same as the latest stored version in another database. Is there a way to get some sort of unique value for a row to match them, or would I have to manually check the rows column by column?</p>  <p>The source database is a SQL Server 2005 database and the table doesn't have a timestamp mechanism for create, update and/or delete action. I've looked around to check if there is row information available but the only thing available is a pseudo column <code>%%lockres%%</code> and the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182776.aspx" rel="nofollow">row information</a>, but that doesn't provide date and or time information.</p>  <p>I'm limited in my tools, but I have a webserver running Apache and PHP and direct access to the source and destination databases. I only have read permissions on the source database.</p>  <p>What would be the most efficient way to compare the data and maintain performance on the source database.</p>
