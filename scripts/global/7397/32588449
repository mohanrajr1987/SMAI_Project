<p>I would need an immediate help here!.. I am trying to add a user to a permission set then i get this error. User has salesforce platform license with default profile.Permission set is created with no User license so that it accepts any licensed user.There is already one salesforce platform user added in permission set, is this restricting me to add other user? if so i can add more user in test sandbox but why not in production?is there any limitation for salesforce platform license? I have also google for help, it show me to disable Auth Apex access.. but my permission set don't have this at all.</p>  <p>Error Message:: "Can't assign permission set xxxx to user xxxx. The user License doesn't allow the permission : view all" and other error "Can't assign permission set xxxx to user xxxx. The user License doesn't allow the permission : Reset User Password and Unlock User"</p>
