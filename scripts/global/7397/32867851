<p>We have had an issue with a <strong>Salesforce</strong> connection on one of our servers, perhaps you can help…</p>  <p>We first noticed the issue as all of our users were unable to login to the web site (where previously it all worked ok). Login to the site works correctly when the site is run from code on a local machine, and when the site is deployed to a different server.</p>  <p>(At the point of login on the website, the code creates a query to Salesforce to find a user. The user exists and the query completes when run from the developer console within Salesforce, and when the code is run locally)</p>  <p>The query returns null when it runs within the website on the server.</p>  <p>The problem sever is: Microsoft Windows Server 2003 R2 (standard edition – with service pack 2) The working server is: Microsoft Windows 2012 R2 (no service pack)</p>  <p>I noticed in Event Viewer on the server, the following message appears when the attempted login/query fails:</p>  <pre><code>Description:  Event code: 4005 Event message: Forms authentication failed for the request.   Reason:   The ticket supplied has expired. </code></pre>  <p>As far as we are aware no change was made to the website or Salesforce... could this be some Windows update issue?</p>
