<p>I need help on the following:</p>  <ul> <li>I downloaded the DocuSign app for Salesforce and started with the configuration (following the instructions in the DocuSign for Salesforce administrator guide).</li> <li>I’ve installed the app in our Salesforce sandbox environment</li> <li>Following the instructions, I’ve signed up for a free 30 day trial and created and activated my account</li> <li>Then, again following the instructions, I logged in to my DocuSign account and connected my DocuSign account with my Salesforce account, the Admin Home view appeared, so the connection was successful and the IP ranges were also added. So far so good…</li> <li>But when I checked the connect setting I got the view as added below…? o   I even clicked on the + sign and tried to add the Salesforce configuration, but it still was not possible to connect.</li> <li>Next I started with adding the DocuSign Button to a custom object (page 37). Also successful.</li> <li>And I started adding the DocuSign status to the custom object we want to use. And I succeeded in adding the lookup relation to DocuSign status.</li> <li>But I could not finish the next step… because there is no connection to the dsfs_DocuSign_Status_c object</li> </ul>
