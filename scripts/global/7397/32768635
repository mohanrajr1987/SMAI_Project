<p>Very new to SOQL. Looking to write a query (to be used in Apex Data Loader) that pulls records with a CreatedDate &lt;= 14 days ago. None of the predefined date options (LAST_N_DAYS, etc.) seem to cover what I'm looking for. I'm guessing/hoping there is something similar to DATEADD(D, -14, DATE()) that can dynamically calculate 14 days ago, so that the criteria would ultimately look like CreatedDate &lt;= DATEADD(D, -14, DATE()).</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
