<p>[SELECT i.Name,(SELECT Name FROM Line_items__r ORDER BY Name) FROM Invoice__c i WHERE i.Name = :invoiceName LIMIT 1];</p>  <p>Why does there need to be an i variable and the parenthesis? For instance, why not just do:</p>  <p>SELECT Name FROM Invoice__c WHERE Name =: invoiceName LIMIT 1? Is the parenthesis like a way to just specifically get the line items? </p>  <p>A walk through of the code would be extremely helpful, thank you!</p>
