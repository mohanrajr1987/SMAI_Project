<p>Looking for help from either SFDC Support or other community member with some experience with this.</p>  <p>We are trying to test using Azure AD as an IdP to SSO into Salesforce, but seem to be running into issues with the Assertion Signature or Certificate.</p>  <p>We followed the following steps from Azure MSDN site:: <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-saas-salesforce-tutorial/" rel="nofollow">https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-saas-salesforce-tutorial/</a></p>  <p>But we are getting the following error in the browser trying to access SFDC:</p>  <pre> Login Error Your login attempt using single sign-on with an identity provider certificate has failed. Please contact your salesforce.com administrator for more information. </pre>  <p>In the SAML Validator in SFDC I am seeing the following error in step 11:</p>  <pre> 11. Validating the Signature Is the response signed? false Is the assertion signed? true The reference in the assertion signature is valid Signature or certificate problems The signature in the assertion is not valid Is the correct certificate supplied in the keyinfo? false </pre>  <p>My concern is that the certificate that we have been told by Azure to upload to SFDC may be incorrect or uploaded to the wrong place or there is some other setting in SFDC that we missed, but I have no idea how to verify this and we simply uploaded the certificate from Azure based on the instructions provided.</p>  <p>The consultant we are working with on the Azure side did mention something about Azure AD using "Signing Key Rollover" and that it may be possible that SFDC does not trust the certificate that Azure is sending since the key in the certificate may be changed every so often.</p>  <p>Is anyone able to shed some light on this for me?</p>  <p>Thanks Miguel =) </p>
