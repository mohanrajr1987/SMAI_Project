<p>I am using Send Grid Apex package for sending out bulk email from salesforce. It's possible to send text files as an attachment with the help of Send Grid API, but it fails for every other type of files (like PDF etc). </p>  <p>Is there any workaround for this problem? I have tried calling web API of sendgrid for attachments from Apex code with the help of callouts. Its not working for PDF and other files.</p>  <p>API doc: <a href="https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-apex" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-apex</a></p>
