<p>So, I'm attempting to create an easier way for my clients to create a new patient record if there is no existing patient based on the Opportunity Creation.  If there is no existing patient, the users can enter the patient's first &amp; last names into separate fields and save the record. A Process then runs to create the patient record simultaneously with the Opportunity record that was just created.</p>  <p><strong>My question is.... Is there any work around to have that newly created patient record update the Patient field (lookup record) on that opportunity without me having to go in and do it manually????</strong></p>  <p>I have tried work flows, validation rules, process builder, etc... and can't find any solution to this since SalesForce doesn't allow for updates of Lookup Fields.</p>
