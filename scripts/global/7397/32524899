<p>We're new to Salesforce and Docusign. I recently installed DocuSign on our Salesforce org, and everything is working great EXCEPT the Salesforce 1 App. Every time you open the app and attempt to look at any record, it immediately looks for a document for DocuSign. If it doesn't find an attachment, it gives an error message: </p>  <p>"The DocuSign Action is designed to work with files from Notes and Attachments and Chatter Documents." This record has no documents attached so the DocuSign action will not work. Add a document to this object and try again." </p>
