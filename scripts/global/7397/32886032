<p>I tried to create a Salesforce community remote hybrid app using the forceios. I have set all the configuration for the same.<br> I am now able to login to the app.<br> But when I hit logout and exit the app; then again run the app, The app directly logs me in, and the old login session seems like it has not been cleared.<br> The control of the app here seems to be inside the cordova and I am not able to do anything.<br> Is there a way to logout the user, when the user hits logout inside the remote hybrid app?</p>  <p>I am able to access the cordova library and fetch the action when the logout is pressed by using the following in the <code>CVViewcontroller</code></p>  <pre><code>- (BOOL)webView:(UIWebView*)theWebView shouldStartLoadWithRequest:(NSURLRequest*)request navigationType:(UIWebViewNavigationType)navigationType {     NSURL* url = [request URL];     NSLog(@"Request : %@",request);     if ([[NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@",url] containsString:@"logout.jsp"])     {     //    Logout Pressed     } } </code></pre>  <p>I wanted to know if it is possible to logout the sessions of the app from within the cordova library code.</p>  <p>The issue has been addressed <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/forums/?id=906F00000009AKeIAM" rel="nofollow">here</a>. This is about editing the salesforce apex code. Is there a different way to do this without editing the apex code?</p>
