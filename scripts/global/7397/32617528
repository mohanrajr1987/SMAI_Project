<p>I'm using the Databasedotcom gem, v1.3.2.</p>  <p>One of the jobs requires lookup and modifying every account in SalesForce. To speed up the entire task, I query SalesForce for all the accounts and store it in a local variable. Because of API limits, I basically loop through and unpaginate the query results. It looks something like this:</p>  <p><code>all_accounts = SFDC.unpaginate(sfdc.accounts.all)</code></p>  <p>Where <code>#unpaginate</code> looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>class SFDC ...     def unpaginate paginated_results         #SFDC api results are paginated. Loop through results and return whole collection.         whole_collection = []         while paginated_results.any? do             whole_collection += paginated_results.to_a             paginated_results = (paginated_results.next_page? ? paginated_results.next_page : []) # if there is no next page, set the variable to an empty array to stop the while loop         end          whole_collection     end end </code></pre>  <p>Is there a better way of getting the whole collection?</p>
