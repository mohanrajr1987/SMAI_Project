<p>Couple of weeks back,started Using nginx as reverse proxy.We have salesforce pages on internet and want to capture the ip of the person viewing the page. before this implementation Was using:</p>  <pre><code>ApexPages.currentPage().getHeaders().get('X-Salesforce-SIP') </code></pre>  <p>But now, with reverse proxy implementation, the IP coming back is the one from nginx and not actual userip.</p>  <p>How can I read the IP of the customer accessing the page?</p>
