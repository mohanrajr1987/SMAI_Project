<p>The <a href="https://developer.linkedin.com/plugins/share" rel="nofollow">LinkedIn social sharing feature</a> pops open a screen where you can set up an email (it knows all your LinkedIn contacts and stuff) and send a link to a page. I have been asked to create a feature like this that sends email from Salesforce. I've searched Salesforce's public docs and found no such feature. And I can't ask on their help forums without having a paid salesforce account (what's up with that?). So I'm hoping maybe someone can help me here!</p>
