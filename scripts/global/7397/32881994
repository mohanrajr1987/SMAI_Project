<p>I have the following exception with my trigger:  System.QueryException: Non-selective query against large object type (more than 100000 rows).  The query used in the trigger is:</p>  <p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false"> <div class="snippet-code"> <pre class="snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override"><code>SELECT Id, Type__c, Assembled__c, Production_Center__c,Transport_to__c, Quality_Control_Result__c, Quality_Control_Date__c    FROM OLI_Core__c    WHERE Production_Center__c = :centerId    ORDER BY Quality_Control_Date__c DESC LIMIT 8000</code></pre> </div> </div> </p>  <p><strong>Production_Center__c</strong> field cannot be null and is a lookup, so it is indexed.  Then, I tried to run the query in the developer consol (replacing <strong>:centerId</strong> with a value) and the query plan give a <strong>cost</strong> around 6.5 at <strong>Index as Leading Operation Type</strong>.</p>  <p>The query plan note this: "<em>Not considering filter for optimization because unindexed. Table: OLI_Core__c Fields: ["IsDeleted"]</em>".  <strong>IsDeleted</strong> is a standard and boolean field, I think it cannot be custom indexed and I also think this is not a good idea even if that is possible.</p>  <p>So, is there any solution to get a cost <strong>bellow 1</strong> at Index Leading Operation Type according to the IsDeleted field problem.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance for any kind of help.</p>
