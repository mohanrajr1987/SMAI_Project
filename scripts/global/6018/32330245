<p>I am making my JFrame transparent by:</p>  <pre><code>myFrame.setUndecorated(true); myFrame.setBackground(new Color(1.0f,1.0f,1.0f,0.0f));  </code></pre>  <p>It makes JFrame transparent but also lost window strip and close button. To make window appear visible I used</p>  <pre><code>AWTUtilities.setOpacity(this, 0.5f); </code></pre>  <p>but I found that this method is only available for java 6 and packaged in AWT package which is restricted in java 7. and the method is also changed in java 7 which is now </p>  <pre><code>Window.setOpacity(float opacity); </code></pre>  <p>but it does not working, Can anyone tell me how to make transparent window and buttons visible along with transparent frame.    </p>
