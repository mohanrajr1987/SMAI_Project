<p>as the title says what I want to achieve is to pop up an option message using JOptionPane such that the question and the buttons be placed on the same line. I'm reading the following tutorials but it seems to be quite difficult:</p>  <ul> <li><a href="http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~jtbauer/cis3931/tutorial/ui/swing/dialog.html" rel="nofollow">How to Make Dialogs</a></li> <li><a href="http://da2i.univ-lille1.fr/doc/tutorial-java/uiswing/components/dialog.html" rel="nofollow">How to Make Dialogs Java</a></li> <li>The definitive guide to Java Swing</li> </ul>  <p>In a sense the idea is to have the following confirmation message layout:</p>  <hr>  <p>The products are going to be removed from the database.</p>  <p>Are you sure you want to perform it?    |YES|   |NO|</p>  <hr>  <p>where YES and NO should be buttons. (The text is not the real one, it's only to give the flavor of the message).</p>  <p>Any comments or hints will be welcomed.</p>  <p>Thanks a lot in advance.</p>
