<p>So I am still quite a newbie when it comes to creating <code>JFrame</code> apps. I have decided to learn a bit more about it by creating a hobby of a project, all has been going pretty well, and I have learnt a lot, but now I'm trying to learn how to use <code>setIconImage()</code> for, ya know, the icon in the top left hand corner of the window (in Windows, not sure in which corner it is shown on Mac OSX and Linux). I have Googled far and wide, however could not really find anything that worked 100%, either it worked in Eclipse, or I got <code>NullPointerExceptions</code>. From what I understand is that when running the <code>.jar</code> file from your desktop, it would do a search for the icon image by starting at your PC's root directory, and not the <code>.jar</code>'s root directory. Anyone got some tips on this that might help? I have pasted my source code for the class that handles the <code>main</code> method for me below, the other classes deal with creating the <code>JFrame</code>, and in this case do the password generation (this is part of the tiny password generator app I made for my office)</p>  <p>Source Code:</p>  <pre><code>    public class ShowWindowDemo()     {         private static final String ICON_PATH = "src\\images\\p_gen.png";          public static void main(String[] args)         {             WindowDemo() gui = new WindowDemo();             gui.setVisible(true);             gui.setResizable(false);             gui.setIconImage(Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getImage(                 ShowWindowDemo.class.getResource(ICON_PATH)));             gui.setLocationRelativeTo(null);             gui.setTitle("PassGen v1.0.6");         }     } </code></pre>  <p>My folder structure for getting to the <code>.png</code> images is <code>src/images/</code>. Whenever I try to run my app in Eclipse using the above mentioned source code, it opens fine, but in my console I get a <code>NullPointerException</code>. I have run the app by using</p>  <pre><code>    gui.setIconImage(Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getImage(ICON_PATH)); </code></pre>  <p>and it works 100% fine.</p>  <p>Any assistance on this would be GREATLY appreciated, I am a bit stuck on this one it seems.</p>
