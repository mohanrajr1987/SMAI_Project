<p>i've got some problem with my Mouse Cursor. I set it inside my MouseMotion Event of a JPanel with this.setCursor(), but it dosen't changed.  After getting out ouf the Window for example on my Desktop and go back inside , the cursor will be changed by any motion. </p>  <p>The Code of the mouse Event of the JPanel is this:</p>  <pre><code>public void mouseMoved(MouseEvent e) {     this.requestFocusInWindow();     this.requestFocus();       this.cL.doMouseMoved(e); } </code></pre>  <p>The Code of the Method doMouseMoved is this:</p>  <pre><code>public void doMouseMoved(MouseEvent e) {     this.lastMouseEvent = e;     this.sList.setCurrentElements(e.getPoint());     this.setMovedCursor(e);  } </code></pre>  <p>An finally this is the code of the method setMovedCursor:</p>  <pre><code>public void setMovedCursor(MouseEvent e) {  java.awt.Cursor cu = new java.awt.Cursor(java.awt.Cursor.SW_RESIZE_CURSOR);  view.setCursor(cu); } </code></pre>  <p>(I know that this isn't the best way) </p>  <p>I hope everyone can help me.  Sorry for any mistakes, it's my first post at stackoverflow.</p>
