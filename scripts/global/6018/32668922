<p>I have this sample code:</p>  <pre><code>@Override protected void paintComponent(Graphics g) {     Graphics2D g2d = (Graphics2D) g;      QuadCurve2D.Double qc = new QuadCurve2D.Double(10, 10, 10, 100, 100, 100);     g2d.setStroke(new BasicStroke(25.4f));     g2d.setPaint(new Color(255, 0, 9));     g2d.draw(qc); } </code></pre>  <p>Now, this draws the follwing curve:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/0HwF3.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/0HwF3.png" alt="Screenshot of rendered window"></a></p>  <p>The problem is: I want to draw a subset of this graph only, e.g. 50%, 25%, 75%, 32%, etc.:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/H6qEl.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/H6qEl.png" alt="Edited image with description of what is expected to be drawn"></a></p>  <p>The above is a image edit of the first and also not accurate. I expect the amount of the curve to be draw to betermined by the distance made my the curve, not the Y amount.</p>
