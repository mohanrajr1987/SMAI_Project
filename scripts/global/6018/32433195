<p>I am trying to make something like the above, a frame that consists of many <code>JButton</code> components (gray rectangles). These buttons are of the exact shape but their positioning looks like the picture. I am new to <code>AWT</code>, Swing and such and don't know what layout should I use, I know a bit of <code>GridLayout</code> and <code>BorderLayout</code> which are obviously not suitable in this case. </p>  <p>Any ideas? </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/mko4A.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/mko4A.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
