<p>I am coding in Java for sometime now. But many a times, in graphics and user interface part, the awt section is skipped or omitted and swing is placed instead and said that awt is of no use or less important. I wish to make android applications in studio.....so is learning and studying awt important in respect to android app development or should i jump over to swing and advance java section?</p>
