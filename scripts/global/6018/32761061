<p>I wrote this code in my Java application:</p>  <pre><code>URL url = new URL("file://c:\\tmp\\test.wmv"); java.awt.Desktop.getDesktop().browse(url.toURI()); </code></pre>  <p>If I execute it, Java throws an "access denied" IOException. Permissions are OK on that file. I renamed that file to "test.txt" so it just has another extension. The result: Notepad opens and shows me the bytes of the file. So it is a problem in executing the media player. I configured the extension settings, so the media player opens when I click on the file in Windows Explorer. But it's not possible for Java to use this Defaultprogram for the wmv-extension. What can I do?</p>
