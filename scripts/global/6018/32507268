<p>I'm very new to the Java playing field. I was doing this tutorial exercise, and I'm unable to figure out how to run the class.</p>  <pre><code>import java.awt.*; import java.awt.event.*;  class Party {     public void buildInvite(){      }     public static void main(String[] args){         Frame f = new Frame();         Label l = new Label("Party at Tim's");         Button b = new Button("You bet");         Button c = new Button("Shoot me");         Panel p = new Panel();         p.add(l);     } } </code></pre>  <p>It compiles without any errors. I just run <code>java Party</code> but nothing happens. I'm assuming it is supposed to pop up with a window that has text that says "Party at Tim's" and two buttons with "You bet" and "Shoot me." Unless I misinterpreted what I wrote. Will someone inform me with what I'm missing. Any help will be appreciated (Please make it nooby so I can understand), Thank you.</p>
