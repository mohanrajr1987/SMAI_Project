<p>I have very little experience with Java, and I am an amateur programmer. So mind my vocabulary.  </p>  <p>I want to be able to stick a static rectangle on top of a rotating rectangle. So far when I try to add another object it spins with the other image. I have tried setting the rotation to zero but that doesn't seem to work. I have also tried to create another class that draws components separately and added them to the frame using frame.add. I have also tried creating another part to the Draw class that has no effect on the GUI. Here is my current Draw class. Any help is appreciated.</p>  <pre><code>class DrawRectangle extends JPanel {      @Override     public void paintComponent(Graphics g) {         int h = this.getHeight();         int w = this.getWidth();         Graphics2D g2 = (Graphics2D) g;          //draw background         g2.setColor(Color.WHITE);         g2.fillRect(0, 0, w, h);          //draw roatiing rectangle         g2.setColor(Color.CYAN);         Rectangle rRec = new Rectangle(w / 4, h / 4, 2 * w / 4, 2 * h / 4);         double wr = rRec.getX() + rRec.getWidth() / 2;         double hr = rRec.getY() + rRec.getHeight() / 2;         g2.rotate(Math.toRadians(count), wr, hr);         g2.fill(rRec);         g2.fillRect(w / 3, h / 3, 2 * w / 3, 2 * h / 3);     }      public void paintComponent2(Graphics g) {         int h = this.getHeight();         int w = this.getWidth();         Graphics2D g2 = (Graphics2D) g;      } }  </code></pre>
