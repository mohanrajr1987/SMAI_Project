<p>I have a JLabel with some text and I would like as soon as the mouse is entered on it, a JTextField to be appeared on the place of the text so that the user can enter some text. If the mouse is not on it, it just displays its text as normal. I use:</p>  <pre><code>JLabel jl = new JLabel("Enter mouse to make a search!") jl.addMouseListener(new MouseAdapter() {      public void mouseEntered(MouseEvent evt)      {          JTextField textField = new JTextField(20);          //????      }       public void mouseExited(MouseEvent evt)      {                  jl.setText("Enter mouse to make a search!");      } }); </code></pre>  <p>However, I am having some troubles on how to replace the jlabel with a jtextfield. How could I do that?</p>
