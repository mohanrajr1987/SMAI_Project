<p>I use a <code>GridBagLayout</code> and place a <code>JLabel</code> on it as the picture shows. I managed to set the size of the <code>JLabel</code> to the desired one via <code>ipadx</code> and <code>ipady</code> but I don't seem to work with the position of it. It seems it is always centered on the middle while I'd like to start from the red dot and don't reposition itself as I resize the window. What should I do?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/FB6I6.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/FB6I6.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Thanks. The code I use is also:</p>  <pre><code>GridBagLayout gbl = new GridBagLayout(); setLayout(gbl); GridBagConstraints gbc = new GridBagConstraints();  JLabel jl = new JLabel("This is a jlabel!", SwingConstants.CENTER); jl.setBorder(BorderFactory.createLineBorder(Color.black)); gbc.fill = GridBagConstraints.HORIZONTAL; gbc.ipadx = 87; gbc.ipady = 220; add(jl, gbc); </code></pre>
