<p>currently I have two Checkboxes, one displays the text: " Numerical Grades", and the other one displays: "Letter grade". I also have a JComboBox with two strings(one are numbers, the other letters). So, my goal here is that when I select numeric grades the JComoBox shows me the numbers string, and viceversa. I'm new at java, although I been trying to figure out how to do this for about two days, it didn't work so I hope you can help me.</p>  <p>English isn't my native language, so if I wrote something wrong I would be pleased that you correct it. </p>  <pre><code>public void dropdownlist () {     JComboBox list;     boolean checked = rb1.getState();     String[] numbers = {"1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10"};     String[] letters = {"F", "D-", "D", "D+", "C-", "C", "C+", "B-", "B", "B+", "A-", "A"};      if(rb1.getState()) {         list = new JComboBox(numbers);         panel.add(list);         System.out.println("rb1 selected");     } else {         list = new JComboBox(letters);         panel.add(list);         System.out.println("rb2 selected");     }      list.addActionListener((ActionEvent e) -&gt; {               });      } </code></pre>  <p>This is what I have so far.</p>
