<p>Here's my code:</p>  <pre><code>import java.applet.*; import java.awt.*;  public class Face extends Applet {     public void paint(Graphics frame) {          // bits of code here     }      public static void main(String[] args) {         String printedOut;         printedOut = printedOut.paint();         System.out.println(printedOut);     } } </code></pre>  <p>I've looked for different solutions to this, but so far, my search has yielded no results. I ran the code two months ago in school and it worked fine, but now any code I write using the paint method, it just doesn't recognize it. I'm using Netbeans, any solution is greatly appreciated. (I'm trying to make a face.) Also, I know my method of printing it out to the applet is pretty remedial but it works, I'd love to see a different way of doing that, thanks in advance.</p>
