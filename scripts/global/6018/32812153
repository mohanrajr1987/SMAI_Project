<p>So the comment for the method below is basically what I need to accomplish. </p>  <p>I have a class called ResearchSite, which represents a research site I create(it's a simple red rectangle that can be created with a mouse press, and changed to blue on a mouse click. This method gives me a variable next, which is null. I'm confused on how to use this variable. The for loop is something I created, and I'm not sure if it will function. </p>  <p>How would I go about using the variable next? </p>  <p>Please note that the ArrayList named _research is something I created. It may not need to be used. The variable next will end up needing to be used.</p>  <pre><code>private ResearchSite getNextSite() {     ResearchSite next = null;     ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////     // get next site from list of sites or from someone who has the     //    list of sites.     ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////      for( int i = 0; i &lt; _research.size( ); i++ )     {         _research.indexOf( 0 );         i++;     }      return next;  } </code></pre>
