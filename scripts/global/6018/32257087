<p>I want to save not only Red, Green, Blue and Alpha in my Image. Every pixel also needs Z-Depth information, like, how far it was away from the camera. Furthermore, I need to display the Image in a JFrame,  so I can't use my custom Image class, but instead I need a BufferedImage or a subclass of it. The Z-Depth shouldn't be visible in the JFrame. I just want to store it.</p>  <p>I've read much about the BufferedImage class.  I assume that I will have to extend classes like SampleModel or ColorModel, but I can't figure out how that should be done. A nice solution would be to instantiate a new BufferedImage but with a custom Pixelclass that also stores depth, without actually extending the BufferedImage. But any solution and any idea will be appreciated!</p>  <p><strong>Does anybody know, which classes I have to extend, in order to save more information in every Pixel?</strong></p>
