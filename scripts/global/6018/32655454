<p>I'm working in an application based on Applets, with Swing and awt. My current task is to replace the call to an applet by a given web site, let say instead of opening an old applet I have to open the address <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">http://stackoverflow.com/</a>. After a short discussion with my technical supervisor he advised me to enbed the web site into the applet. </p>  <p>The issue is the following:</p>  <ul> <li>Can We embed a web site into an applet?</li> <li>If yes, how? May be embedding the site into a JPanel, isn't it?</li> </ul>  <p>I did found plenty of ways of embedding an applet into a html page but not the other way around.</p>  <p>Thanks a lot in advance!</p>  <p>EDIT: As a matter of completing the question I finally found some links on Stackoverflow that may help someonelse:</p>  <ul> <li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/145863/best-java-swing-browser-component?lq=1">Best Java/Swing browser component?</a></li> <li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2020854/embed-firefox-browser-in-java-swing?lq=1">Embed Firefox browser in Java Swing</a></li> <li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10601676/display-a-webpage-inside-a-swing-application">Display a webpage inside a swing application</a></li> </ul>
