<p>My app has connected to remote push notification service. In server side they want to keep a unique ID for the device and it should not change even the app has deleted and re installed. Can we get Device UDID and send to the server? And If I did it will Apple reject my app from the store? And I think that is the best ID to keep permanantly in the server side even the app deleted.?</p>  <p>I need your suggestions. Please help me. Thanks</p>
