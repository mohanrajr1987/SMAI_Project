<p>I want to <code>presentViewController</code> when an <code>alertController</code> is presented.</p>  <p>I want such as if user presses the Ok button now i want to show the <code>ViewController</code> from AppDelegate on PushNotification.</p>  <p>I came to know on SO that <code>UIAlertController</code> is presented on different thread so want to present the <code>ViewController</code> after user presses Ok Button and moves on to main thread as below:</p>  <pre><code>func presentRScreenFromRootViewController() {      let storyboard: UIStoryboard = UIStoryboard(name: "Main", bundle: nil)     let rViewController = storyboard.instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier("rsh") as! R_SVC     dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(),{          self.window?.rootViewController?.presentViewController(rViewController, animated: true, completion: nil)       });  } </code></pre>  <p>But I get warning as:</p>  <blockquote> <pre><code> Attempt to present &lt;BB.R_SVC: 0x15b983600&gt;  on  &lt;SWRevealViewController: 0x15652df00&gt; which is already presenting  &lt;UIAlertController: 0x15b4f2dd0&gt; </code></pre> </blockquote>  <p>This is because the viewcontroller is presenting alertcontroller.Other times its working well..My rootViewController changes and moves to next screen..But when there is UIAlertController i get warning as attempt to present viewcontroller which is not in the view hierarchy</p>  <p><strong>What am i doing wrong?</strong></p>
