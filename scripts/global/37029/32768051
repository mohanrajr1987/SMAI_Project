<p>I want to send push notifications using the Javascript SDK with content-available = 1</p>  <p>According to Parse.com documentation I should do it this way :</p>  <pre><code>Parse.Push.send({   channels: [ "Mets" ],   data: {     alert: "The Mets scored! The game is now tied 1-1.",     badge: "Increment",     sound: "cheering.caf",     title: "Mets Score!"   } }, {   success: function() {     // Push was successful   },   error: function(error) {     // Handle error   } }); </code></pre>  <p>The problem is Javascript does not accept <code>content-available</code> as a key because of the "-".</p>  <p>I tried to put <code>"content-availabe"</code> between quotes. But then It is not recognized by iOS.</p>  <p>To make sure the quotes are not a solution, I tried it with the <code>sound</code> field.</p>  <pre><code>sound : "ring.wav" // works very well  "sound" : "ring.wav" // no sound is played !!! </code></pre>  <p>So how do I set <code>content-available</code> to <code>1</code> ?</p>
