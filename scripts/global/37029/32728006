<p>I'm trying to send a basic APNS push notification to a specific APNS token using AWS SNS. All the examples I'm finding are how to store the token in SNS, subscribe to channels, and publish to channels. </p>  <p>I don't need that kind of usage with the application I'm building. The golang application decides which users a push needs to be sent to for which actions. Then it looks up the tokens for those users in the DB. All I need is a basic request to send a push notification to that token (preferably asynchronously).</p>  <p>Here is one of the examples I've looked at: <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/service/sns/SNS.html#Publish-instance_method" rel="nofollow">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/service/sns/SNS.html#Publish-instance_method</a></p>
