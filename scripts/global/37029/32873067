<p>I have 2 development devices. I have push set up and both devices get the notifications my server sends. </p>  <p>I added a third device. I registered it in the dev center and deployed the app to it. Also, when I look in the provisioning profiles, I can clearly see all three devices there.</p>  <p>App works but the 3rd device does not get the notifications managed via APN cert I hold in Parse which I generated before I added the 3rd device. </p>  <p>So the first action I took was to create a new APN cert and upload it to Parse. Unfortunately, the 3rd device still does not get the push notification.</p>  <p>Do I need to delete all profiles, certs, app ids and start from scratch? I'm at a loss.</p>  <p>Thoughts?</p>
