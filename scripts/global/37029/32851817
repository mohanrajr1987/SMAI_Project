<p>I'm trying to make GKTurnBasedMatch's <strong>sendReminderToParticipants</strong> work correctly in conjunction with <strong>Localisable.strings</strong> so as to implement 'poke' functionality whereby you poke another player to have their turn.  </p>  <ol> <li>Here is what my Localisable.strings file looks like:</li> </ol>  <p>"POKE" = "%@ has poked you!";</p>  <ol start="2"> <li>It's set to UTF-16 encoding as per below:</li> </ol>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/4hvNy.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/4hvNy.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <ol start="3"> <li><p>And here is my function call:</p>  <pre><code>let messageKey = "POKE" if opponent?.player?.alias != nil {     match.sendReminderToParticipants([opponent!], localizableMessageKey: messageKey, arguments: [localPlayer.alias!]) { (error) in         if error != nil {             NSLog("Problem poking player: \(error!.description)")         }     }      NSLog("You have poked the opponent for match \(match.matchID).  resetting poke date")     APPDELEGATE.pokeMgr.update(match.matchID!) } </code></pre></li> <li><p>Localisable.strings is included in the "Copy Bundle Resources" of my build phases for my build target</p></li> <li><p>I deleted the app from my device and rebuilt it cleanly.</p></li> </ol>  <p>Issue:  It doesn't work! The push notification that is received simply is the default one saying "Your Turn".  I must have missed something.  Can someone please advise if there is something else I need to have done to make this work?</p>
