<p>I've upgraded my devices to iOS 9 and my Xcode environment to 7.0 (7A220).  My app registers for notifications via:</p>  <pre><code>[[UIApplication sharedApplication] registerForRemoteNotifications]; </code></pre>  <p>However, neither "didRegisterForRemoteNotificationWithDeviceToken" or "didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError" are called.  Furthermore, my app does not appear in the Settings->Notifications section (which tells me its not even trying to register for remote/push notifications)</p>  <p>My App ID has the following Application Services enabled:</p>  <ul> <li>Game Center</li> <li>In-App Purchase</li> <li>Push Notifications</li> </ul>  <p>In Xcode, the following capabilities enabled:</p>  <ul> <li><p>Push Notifications</p></li> <li><p>Background Modes (Remote Notifications)</p></li> </ul>  <p>This worked fine with iOS 8, with app built with Xcode 6. Also, it no longer works with an iOS 8 device when built with Xcode 7.</p>
