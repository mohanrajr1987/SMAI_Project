<p>A couple of weeks it was working fine, even when we set a proxy (host,port,proxyauthentication). There was no change in the proxy settings itself, but suddenly the push notifications stopped to reach the device.</p>  <p>The used library is Javapns-2.3.336</p>  <p>For testing purpose, we created a simple code to check if it is working without a proxy. If we test on a system where we do not need a proxy, it is working fine. If we test the same code on the system with the proxy, it is not working. javapsn logs show in both "message has been streamed out successfully" in debug log.</p>  <p><strong>EDIT 1:</strong> Here is the little test code I used(removed critical data with "SOME..."):</p>  <pre><code> List&lt;PushedNotification&gt; notifications = new ArrayList&lt;PushedNotification&gt;();        List&lt;String&gt; devices = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();         devices.add("SOMEDEVICE");         List&lt;Device&gt; appleDevices = Devices.asDevices(devices);          AppleNotificationServer server = new AppleNotificationServerBasicImpl(                 "SOMECERT", "SOMEPW", false); //      String encodeProxyAuthorization = encodeProxyAuthorization(userName, //              userPassword); //      server.setProxy("SOMEPROXY", SOMEPORT); //      server.setProxyAuthorization(encodeProxyAuthorization);          PushNotificationManager pushNotificationManager = new PushNotificationManager();         pushNotificationManager.initializeConnection(server);          Payload payload = NewsstandNotificationPayload.contentAvailable();          pushNotificationManager.sendNotification(appleDevices.get(0), payload,                 false);          System.out.println("DONE"); </code></pre>  <p>Then we created a tcpdump and checked if there is a problem with the connection between the proxy and apple server. But looking into the tcpdump you can see that the handshake is fine and everything is sent to Apple, even the content.available() was sent and we receive the acknowledgement and finish flag.</p>  <p>Inbound and outbound TCP packets are allowed over port 2195 and 2196.</p>  <p>Certificate is the same (created when it worked before). We used it also on the test without the proxy and it worked fine.</p>  <p>The next step would be to test the feedback service with the workaround of having 2 sandbox apps on your device so that we can check the tcpdump again when we receive something from the feedback service.</p>  <p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong> <em>Created just a skeleton app which does nothing and only connects to the APNS. Then we deleted the original App and we where able to receive a response from the Feedback Service. After this initial test (without proxy), i triggered the same code with proxy settings on the other environment. We also received the invalid token id from the Feedback Service. This basically means, that our Push Notifications where sent to Apple APNS but never arrived on the devices. So we tried something else, we re-installed the app and tested it on both systems. Now it seems to work on both systems. There where no changes in the proxy settings and no changes in the infrastructure. I do not think that this test scenario is solving this issue, but from now on it seems to work.</em></p>  <p>Is there something I am missing? I have the feeling it is a tiny thing I am missing to make it work again...</p>
