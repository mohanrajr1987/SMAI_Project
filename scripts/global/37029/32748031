<p>For the user to allow badge / sound / alert and to get the notification token, I use the simple and classic code (for iOS >= 8) in the <code>application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:</code></p>  <pre><code>UIUserNotificationType types = UIUserNotificationTypeBadge | UIUserNotificationTypeSound | UIUserNotificationTypeAlert; UIUserNotificationSettings *settings = [UIUserNotificationSettings settingsForTypes:types categories:nil]; [application registerUserNotificationSettings:settings]; [application registerForRemoteNotifications]; </code></pre>  <p>After calling this code on an iOS9 device, the <code>didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:</code> callback is called and I get my token.</p>  <p>But running the exact same code, same bundleId, on an iOS8 device gives me an error (through the <code>didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:</code> callback).</p>  <p>The error is the "no valid 'aps-environment' entitlement string found for application", which doesn't make sense in this case because it's working fine on iOS9!</p>
