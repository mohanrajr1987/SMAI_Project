<p>Question Does anyone know where the vulnerabilities are in Apple's apns push notification services? </p>  <p>We can ensure that our notifications are sent securely to apple, so we just need to know whether they can be intercepted from that point?</p>  <p>Motiviation We have built an iOS messaging app that we are making as a 100% secure solution, with some features that have never been exploited before in security. </p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
