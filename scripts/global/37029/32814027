<p>I am working on a chat app that has several different groups. </p>  <p><strong>As soon as an user post a new message in a given chat group, all the users that are in that same chat group get a notification that will reload/update that given view to reveal/load the new messages.</strong></p>  <p><strong>The following code uploads a notification to parse:</strong></p>  <pre><code>var push: PFPush = PFPush() push.setChannel("Reload")  var data: NSDictionary = ["alert":"","badge":"1","content-available":"1","sound":""]  push.setData(data as [NSObject : AnyObject]) push.sendPushInBackground() </code></pre>  <p><strong>This part gets the code and fires the notification to reload the tableview</strong></p>  <pre><code> func application(application: UIApplication, didReceiveRemoteNotification userInfo: [NSObject : AnyObject]) {          println("didReceiveRemoteNotification \(userInfo)")         PFPush.handlePush(userInfo)         var notification = userInfo["aps"] as? NSDictionary         println("NOTIFICATION \(notification)")         var teste: AnyObject? = notification?.objectForKey("badge")         println("TESTE \(notification)")          if let aps: AnyObject = userInfo["aps"] {             if let apsDict = aps as? [String : AnyObject]{                 if let notification: AnyObject = apsDict["content-available"] {                     if notification.isEqualToNumber(1) {                         println("BADGE \(notification)")                         NSNotificationCenter.defaultCenter().postNotificationName("reloadTimeline", object: nil)                     }                 }             }         } </code></pre>  <p>I am not sure if using push notifications is the correct way of doing it. As as soon as the user turn of push notifications the whole approach stops working. </p>  <p>Is there a way around that with push or I should do it completely different?</p>
