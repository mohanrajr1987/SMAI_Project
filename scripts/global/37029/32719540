<p>In the Quality of Service section in the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/Chapters/ApplePushService.html" rel="nofollow">Apple Documentation</a>, it states:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>If APNs attempts to deliver a notification but the device is offline,   the notification is stored for a limited period of time, and delivered   to the device when it becomes available.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Does anyone know how long "a limited period of time" is, and whether they are then deleted from APNS once they are sent?</p>
