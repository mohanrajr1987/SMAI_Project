<p>I'm trying to have my app automatically navigate to a notifications view that will display the notification that was sent to the user. </p>  <p>To put it briefly, I have a series of <code>UIViewController</code> objects defining the login process, which links to a <code>UITabViewController</code> if login was successful. Within the <code>UITabViewController</code> are 5 attached <code>UIViewControllers</code>. </p>  <p>When a user taps a notification banner, I'd like the screen to display the <strong>fourth</strong> <code>UIViewController</code>. I've been tinkering with this method for a while, trying to display the VC upon a user tapping the notification:</p>  <pre><code>func application(application: UIApplication, didReceiveRemoteNotification userInfo: [NSObject : AnyObject]) {   let rootViewController = window!.rootViewController as! UINavigationController //the rootVC in the storyboard   let welcomeVC = rootViewController.topViewController as! WelcomeVC //welcome page   let loginVC = welcomeVC... //welcomeVC has a segue to this     //after loginVC is the UITabViewController   //I want to show the 4th VC of the UITabViewController when user taps the notification } </code></pre>  <p>I'm afraid this approach isn't going to work. In particular, I also have the problem of dealing with 2 different scenarios:</p>  <ol> <li>User taps the notification while the app is not in memory</li> <li>User taps the notification while the app is in memory</li> </ol>  <p>Thanks in advance for the advice!</p>
