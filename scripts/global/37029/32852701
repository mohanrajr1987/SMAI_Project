<p>When I try and send a message with pyapns I get this traceback:</p>  <pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):   File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;   File "build/bdist.linux-x86_64/egg/pyapns/client.py", line 75, in wrapper   File "build/bdist.linux-x86_64/egg/pyapns/client.py", line 67, in wrapper   File "build/bdist.linux-x86_64/egg/pyapns/client.py", line 97, in notify   File "build/bdist.linux-x86_64/egg/pyapns/client.py", line 127, in _xmlrpc_thread   File "build/bdist.linux-x86_64/egg/pyapns/client.py", line 65, in errback_wrapper   File "build/bdist.linux-x86_64/egg/pyapns/client.py", line 55, in errback xmlrpclib.Fault: &lt;Fault 8002: 'error'&gt; </code></pre>  <p>How can I debug this further? Is this an issue with my app communicating with the pyapns service or an issue with pyapns communicating with Apple? </p>
