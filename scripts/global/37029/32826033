<p>a simple question: is it possible to get a message, notification or similar when the internet connection is available when app is killed or not running?</p>  <p>For my purpose, I need a way to synchronize all my notifications because APNs can send only the last message.</p>  <p>EDIT: I'm wondering how some apps (e.g. whatsapp) are able to sync their notifications when the internet connection is up. If I kill whatsapp, I can receive multiple notification when internet connection is reachable, but the APNS server provides only last message and, for this case, I'm not able to send silent notification. If I should develop a chat application, what are the best practices to work with Apple notifications?</p>
