<p>On my server (Debian 3.2.54-2 x86_64 GNU/Linux), I use this command to check the connection with APNS (Apple Push Notification Server):</p>  <pre> telnet gateway.sandbox.push.apple.com 2195 Trying 17.172.232.46... Trying 17.172.232.45... Trying 17.172.232.18... telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection timed out </pre>  <pre> ping gateway.sandbox.push.apple.com PING gateway.sandbox.push-apple.com.akadns.net (17.172.232.46) 56(84) bytes of data.  </pre>  <p>The telnet failed to help me connect. What is the reason for that?</p>  <p>1) Do I need to ask the admin to configure the firewall to let the telnet go through the port 2195?</p>  <p>2) When we use a telnet to a server with a given port, what port on our side will be open? <pre> telnet gateway.sandbox.push.apple.com 2195 </pre> means the port 2195 on APNS will be opened, so which port on our computer will be open to establish the connection?</p>
