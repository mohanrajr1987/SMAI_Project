<p>I don't understand how such a thing can happen: I have created an Xcode project (Xcode 6) and I imported some files from a previous project (a Storyboard, the Images.xcassets file and some .h and .m files)</p>  <p>Now when I import some of those headers in my code, each line using a NSString reports the error "Reference to NSString is ambiguous".</p>  <p>Is this a known issue, how to solve that?</p>
