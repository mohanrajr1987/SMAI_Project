<p>I'd like to draw a specific character number in a font  using NSString's drawAtPoint() routine. </p>  <p>To do this I've been casting the integer value of the specific character into an NSString: </p>  <pre><code>int characterNumber = 150; //character 150 in a particular font  NSString* myString = [NSString stringWithCharacters:(const unichar*)&amp;characterNumber length:1]; </code></pre>  <p>This works if the character number is less than 128. If the characterNumber is greater than that (my font contains 200+ characters) then no character prints. If the character number is 150, and I change the string length to 2, then the wrong character from the font prints. </p>  <p>Is this an encoding issue? </p>
