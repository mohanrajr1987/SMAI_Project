<p>When I parse an article with Readability's Parse API, it spits the article content back to me as an <code>NSString</code> looking like this:</p>  <p><a href="http://pastebin.com/8QiZc4E4" rel="nofollow">http://pastebin.com/8QiZc4E4</a></p>  <p>For my purposes I only need the main paragraphs in the article. I have no experience with HTML, so how would I be able to manipulate the <code>NSString</code> to only give me the main paragraphs (each block of text between the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code> tags)?</p>
