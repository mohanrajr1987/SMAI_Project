<p>My Case:</p>  <p>I've 2 variables that are becoming zombies. They are declared like this:</p>  <pre><code>@interface SyncPoolController : NSObject {     NSString *lastUploadQueryTime;     NSString *lastDownloadQueryTime;     NSString *pendingPkId;     NSDate *pendingTimeStamp;     MediaQueue *currentQueue; } </code></pre>  <p>This call sync data between web server and local database. If a user signs out and then sign in only this 2 variables are becoming zombies. Other variables are okay.</p>  <p>I don't have any idea why this is happening. Thanks in advance. Please let me know if any further informations are needed.</p>
