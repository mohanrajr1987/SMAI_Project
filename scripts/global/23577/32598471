<p>I have run into a definite issue with NSString and boundingRectWithSize.</p>  <p>On an iOS 8 iPhone, everything is sound and well. It calculates the correct size of a string when rendered with a font at a certain size. With a iOS 9 GM seed iPhone, the width is always maxed out at 320, consistently. If the string is short, below 320 points, that will be correctly and consistently reported as on an iOS 8 device, but when an iOS 8 device reports a width beyond 320, the iOS 9 device always reports a width of 320.</p>  <p>The app is compiled using Xcode 6.4, ie using iOS 8 SDK. The OS I use is OS X El Capitan GM seed. I have <em>heard</em>, that using Xcode 6 on El Capitan is not really recommended. The recommended version of Xcode for El Capitan is Xcode 7. I cannot use Xcode 7 yet (but will try it shortly, just to try...) because of business reasons. <strong>UPDATE: I just tried compiling using Xcode 7 and SDK 9.0 - the widths are still maxed out at 320. The Xcode and/or SDK version is not the issue. iOS 9.0 is either bugged here or just behaves differently ;-)</strong></p>  <p>Anyone ran into the issue? If I find no one else, I guess I will report this bug (I suspect it is a bug. Or just inconsistent behaviour which I really don't think Apple meant without giving some kind of deprecation warning) to Apple.</p>
