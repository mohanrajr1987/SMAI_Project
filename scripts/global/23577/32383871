<p>I have a string containing date in a short date format, which i would like to convert to NSDate. What I tried is as follows </p>  <pre><code>NSDateFormatter *dateFormat = [[NSDateFormatter alloc] init]; [dateFormat setDateFormat:@"MM/dd/yyyy h:mm a"]; NSDate *date = [dateFormat dateFromString:text]; </code></pre>  <p>The date object is nil always, not sure if i am specifying the date format wrong , or is it not at all possible to convert such string to date ? The string is in following format</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Fri Sep 4, 2015 10am</p> </blockquote>  <p>Please suggest a solution.</p>
