<p>I want to call to a number which comes from JSON. But in one scenario "," is coming in this data and in another scenario "/" is coming. How can I give the condition to seperate that data? </p>  <p>Here is my code</p>  <pre><code>if ([strNumbers containsString:@"/"]) {         arrOfNumber = [strNumbers componentsSeparatedByString:@"/"];  } else if([strNumbers containsString:@","]) { arrOfNumber = [strNumbers componentsSeparatedByString:@","]; } </code></pre>  <p>When it goes to <code>if</code> condition app gets crash.</p>
