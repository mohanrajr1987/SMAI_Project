<p><a href="https://arashnorouzi.wordpress.com/2011/08/31/adding-graphics-and-emoji-characters-to-apple-push-notifications/" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is a pretty good article that references iOS emoticons and their code. For example <code>\ue008</code> for the small camera.</p>  <p>I tried this in my code :</p>  <pre><code>var myText: String = "\ue008" </code></pre>  <p>This is not accepted by xCode. How to include it ?</p>
