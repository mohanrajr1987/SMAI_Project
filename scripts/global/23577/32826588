<p>I'm grabbing an element from an NSMutableDictionary, which was created by getting the data back from an NSURLSessionDataTask and using NSJSONSerialization to deserialize it like so:</p>  <pre><code>NSDictionary* json = [NSJSONSerialization JSONObjectWithData:data                                                       options:kNilOptions                                                         error:&amp;error]; </code></pre>  <p>So after returning the JSON, I cache it in an NSCache and then when I pick it up again to use, I try to get an element that seems to show up as an NSNumber:</p>  <pre><code>NSString *hopefullyAString = [[NSNumber numberWithLong:settings[@"hopefullyAString"] stringValue]];  </code></pre>  <p>Now I set my breakpoint and this is what I plug into the console:</p>  <pre><code>(lldb) po labs(hopefullyAString.longValue) error: property 'longValue' not found on object of type 'NSString *' error: 1 errors parsing expression  (lldb) po [hopefullyAString isKindOfClass:[NSString class]] false </code></pre>  <p>Which is weird because on one hand I can't get the longValue of an NSString, but apparently, the so called string is not an NSString. What is going on?</p>  <p>Ultimately, this is what I want: </p>  <pre><code>anotherString = [anotherString stringByAppendingString:hopefullyAString]; </code></pre>  <p>But when I plug it in, I get an error:</p>  <pre><code>(lldb) po queryParams = [anotherString stringByAppendingString:hopefullyAString] 2015-09-28 11:22:09.946 SomeApp[826:265400] -[__NSCFNumber length]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0xb0000000004cfa73 error: Execution was interrupted, reason: internal ObjC exception breakpoint(-3)..

I'm using Xcode 7, not sure if that's related, but the same code was working a few weeks ago when I was back on Xcode 6.</p>
