<p>This can be considered a follow-up question to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3990792/delete-a-sub-string-given-a-nsrange">this question about how to 'Delete a substring given an NSRange'. </a></p>  <p>Let's say I have a long string, and I would like to delete a few characters from location 'a', a few from location 'b', a few from location 'c' and so on. </p>  <p>If it were a single location and range, I would have used something like:</p>  <pre><code>NSString *result = [baseString stringByReplacingCharactersInRange:range withString:@""]; </code></pre>  <p>In this case of several locations and ranges, I can always use a for loop. But that would be inconvenient because I will have to change every other range as well as the string size at every iteration of deleting something. </p>  <p>Is there a simpler way to do this in a single iteration? </p>
