<p>I have imported 2 font files to my resources group in my project, and also added them to my plist file:</p>  <p>pt-sans.narrow-bold.ttf and PT_Sans-Narrow-Web-Bold.ttf</p>  <p>I want to set bold font to attributed string, but it can't find my fonts, i am getting this error: </p>  <pre><code>(UIFont*) nil </code></pre>  <p>This is how i am setting the font:</p>  <pre><code>UIFont *font_bold=[UIFont fontWithName:@"PT Sans Narrow Bold" size:14.0f]; </code></pre>  <p>It needs to be font from this family. Any idea, what am i doing wrong?</p>
