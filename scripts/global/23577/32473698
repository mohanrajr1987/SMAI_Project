<p>When my Xcode Project compiles with .mm file am getting multiple errors and all the errors are same <code>"Default initialization of an object of const type 'NSString *const __strong'"</code> and it's suggesting to put <code>=nil</code>. Some .cpp files also included and .mm not making the problem when I put C++ code in .mm the errors are appearing. We all know that if we put .mm it will compile both Objective-C and C++. The errors are mostly with <code>NSString *const object;</code> kind of initialization. I don't want put extern before that or to do some other modification on it because those classes written by someone else in client onshore team, so I should not touch those. </p>
