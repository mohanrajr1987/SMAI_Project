<p>I have an iOS app which downloads and parses a JSON file. The JSON file returns the following data which I am storing in a NSString:</p>  <pre><code>{     jacknode = "The Lite - Mon, Sep, 14, 2015 - 12:00 GMT"; } </code></pre>  <p>Is there a way of using Regex to delete the curly brackets and preferebly the "jacknode =" part of the string?</p>  <p>I tried creating a NSString and even resorted to using the <code>[string description]</code> method to see if the brackets would get deleted but they didn't. This tells me that the curly brackets are actually <strong>PART OF THE STRING</strong>. I don't mind that, but how can I manually delete them.</p>  <p>Note: If you are wandering why the JSON file returns such weirdly formatted data... well its a long story and I don't have time to change it right now.</p>  <p>Thanks for your time, Dan.</p>
