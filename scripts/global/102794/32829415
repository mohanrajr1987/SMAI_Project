<p>I'm using Visual Studio 2015 Community on Windows 10. The Windows Phone 8.1 Emulator used to work just fine, until I tried to shut Hyper-V down (unsuccessfully). </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/6jyPu.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/6jyPu.png" alt="Hyper-V"></a></p>  <p>When rebooting, Windows displayed that there is a problem and that it won't be able to complete the task and that it will revert to its original state. </p>  <p>When it started again Hyper-V was still activated, but a problem started showing up when I started the emulator from Visual Studio.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ti4KF.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ti4KF.png" alt="Emulator View"></a></p>  <p>And after a few minutes it prompts this error:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/3zuwW.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/3zuwW.png" alt="UDP Port"></a></p>  <p>I know that the virtual machine is running because I can access it from the Hyper-V Manager:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/2Rr56.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/2Rr56.png" alt="Hyper-V Manager"></a></p>  <hr>  <p>I tried all solutions available online:</p>  <ol> <li>Deleting the virtual machine, and restarting Visual Studio as administrator.</li> <li>Deleting the internal Switch and re-creating it (manually and by running the emulator from Visual Studio) <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/app8M.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/app8M.png" alt="Switch"></a></li> <li>Shutting down the FireWall.</li> <li>Sharing the WIFI internet access to the virtual network.</li> </ol>  <p>Nothing worked. Anyone has seen this before? </p>
