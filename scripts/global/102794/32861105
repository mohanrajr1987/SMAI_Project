<p>So, this is the problem that I'm trying to solve using background agents: I need to continue on logging the user location when he goes offline in background even after device reset (thing of a running app for context).</p>  <p>To try and solve this I've used a Periodic task from <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh202941(v=vs.105).aspx" rel="nofollow">this approach</a> word-for-word, which did work in debug mode. But, as I left the phone unattended overnight I've had only one log for the user after half an hour of leaving the phone. No further entries have been recorded (have in mind that I've used test log entry and not real GPS signal, which means I only triggered simple log writing for test purposes).</p>  <p>Am I missing something? Is this not a valid solution for this problem. If so, could you please provide a reason for this, as I was unable to find any documentation that speaks of that sort of limitation.</p>
