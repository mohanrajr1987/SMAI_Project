<p>I want to add in app purchase and trial mode for my app. In my app, some features are disabled and you have to buy app to enable them.<br> I search a little, I found some example just for Windows Phone or Windows 8.1 store app. also they use simulation for purchase.<br> I have some questions:<br> 1) How can I do that for Windows 8.1 Universal app.<br> 2) How can I test it. (I have to publish that But how can Hide my app in store and test it myself in my phone or PC. Is it possible to show how to do that in my Dev center too?. Is it possible to test it without publish?)<br> 3) Person buy app just for one time.</p>  <p>I'm sorry for bad English.<br> Is it possible to help me and give me some codes for this?<br> Thanks. </p>
