<p>I develop a map application allowing among others to establish routes and directions, under Windows Phone 8.1 RT.</p>  <p>I got a valid Application Id and Authentication Token from my dashboard and I set them for my MapControl and and my MapService.</p>  <p>When I test my application under my mobile with a debug build or release from the Visual Studio 2015 environment, it works perfectly on all routes and direction that I create. So my Application ID and  Authentication Token are correct.</p>  <p>Recently I created a package that I downloaded on the store. When I download my app from the store to my mobile and I use my application, all routes that exceed a distance of about 300 km from my position returns me the Invalid Credentials error like that i do not have a valid Application ID and Authentification Token !</p>  <p>I do not understand why ? Any ideas?</p>
