<p>I am using <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/reference" rel="nofollow">Google Sign-in</a> to authenticate users on my website and then as a separate step asking for offline permissions.</p>  <p>According to the documentation, the GoogleUser object should have a method "grantOfflineAccess" which prompts for additional permissions <strong>without</strong> prompting the user to confirm their account. However inspecting the object in Firebug, I find all the other methods described but not grantOfflineAccess.</p>  <p>I have a workaround using the GoogleAuth object's grantOfflineAccess method but that forces the user to confirm their account (which I would like to avoid, as they have <strong>just</strong> performed that step during login). I would like to keep the login and authorize offline access prompts separate so I can do some validation between them.</p>  <p>Is the documentation wrong/outdated? Is there another way to get my desired behaviour? </p>
