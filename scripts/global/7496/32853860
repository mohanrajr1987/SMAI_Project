<p>Is there any way to automate the Import Function from Google Sheets in Javascript?</p>  <p>Something like:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt;      &lt;head&gt;         &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="https://www.google.com/jsapi"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;         &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;                 var dataDestinationUrl = 'https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s3Pu-Sr4BwaBTqKYX2BDLZICf8sNko5D6v6O-ysot7g';                var dataSource = 'c:\MyExcel.xlsx'                  function importData() {                     dataDestinationUrl.import (DataSource)                }           &lt;/script&gt;       &lt;/head&gt;      &lt;body&gt;            &lt;input type="button" onclick="importData" value="Submit" /&gt;      &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; </code></pre>  <p>What I'm looking to do is something like this: </p>  <p><a href="https://www.dataeverywhere.com/use-excel-sheets" rel="nofollow">https://www.dataeverywhere.com/use-excel-sheets</a>  </p>  <p>but because corporation restrictions I cannot have adds-on.  However, I can program an script in Javascript to do it and use the script.</p>  <p>Further explanation: </p>  <ul> <li><p>Most reports are done in Excel because are connected to a database in IBM Cognos TM1 through a plug-in or add-in, The data sits in IBM Cognos TM1 and through the plug-in is push to Excel.</p></li> <li><p>However, Google Sheets doesn't have (as far as I know) any way to connect to IBM Cognos TM1.</p></li> <li><p>Reports are extensive, several tabs, many rows and columns so copying and pasting all that information from many reports to Google Sheets won't be a solution.</p></li> <li><p>There is also the import solution, but this is not only for 1 file 1 time. There are multiple files that are update daily, weekly, biweekly and monthly, so the import option is not a solution either. Anything that would need human intervention won't be really a solution. I need to find out how to automatically synchronize Google Sheets with Excel Files.</p></li> <li><p>I was trying to think on a way to "Import", Transfer, Synchronize or anything similar so I could indicate where is the location of my Excel file (C;\MyExcel.xlsx) and automatically have the information replicated into a Google Sheets.</p></li> </ul>  <p>Can I maybe to this with the Google Sheets API? If so, do you know how?</p>  <p>Thank you very much</p>
