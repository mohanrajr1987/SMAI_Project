<p>We are working on implementing a store locator in a commercial application.</p>  <p>For ex:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.walmart.com/store/finder?location=94108&amp;distance=50" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/store/finder?location=94108&amp;distance=50</a></p>  <p>The application should be able to detect current location or detect location based on zip code or address.</p>  <p>It should return the first 10 to 50 closest stores (Along with the distance from location selected). Address of stores will be maintained in database.</p>  <p>We are using AngularJS. So is there a component available on AngularJs or jQuery?</p>  <p>We know that using Google API will cost money for us. So what are the best practices to be considered when building such application in terms of money? </p>  <p>Money is the huge factor for us. We like to spend as little as possible. Is it possible to achieve the same without spending money? Are there any free services other than Google?</p>  <p>Once we built this, the application will be used by 1000s of users per day (Not in million at least for few months)</p>
