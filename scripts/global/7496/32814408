<p>I have a ruby on rails <strong>background process</strong> that needs to pull data from the Google AdSense API <code>("INDIVIDUAL_AD_IMPRESSIONS","CLICKS","INDIVIDUAL_AD_IMPRESSIONS_CTR","COST_PER_CLICK","INDIVIDUAL_AD_IMPRESSIONS_RPM","EARNINGS")</code> and save it to my local database.</p>  <p>I need to access the AdSense API without any user interaction.  This app is deployed on Heroku so it must be able to successfully authenticate from various different hosts without any errors.</p>  <p>I want to do this using the google-api-client and googleauth gems.</p>  <p>This AdSense account is owned by a GoogleApps domain.</p>
