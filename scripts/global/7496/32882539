<p>I want to restrict address suggestions for list of postal codes. I know-  how to restrict for the country.          how to set biasing for location and radius.          how to add filtration for place type and all. but, I want to restrict search for a set of postal codes. Is it feasible to do through google autocomplete?</p>
