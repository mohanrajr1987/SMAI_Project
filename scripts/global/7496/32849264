<p>My web app uses <code>Meteor.loginWithGoogle</code> with <code>requestPermissions: ['email']</code> to login users.</p>  <p>I would like to connect to Google Drive of some users on their request and create some Google Docs.</p>  <h2>1. Getting permission</h2>  <p>How can I get the permission to access the Google Drive of the user?</p>  <p>Should I call the function <code>Meteor.loginWithGoogle</code> with more permissions? Maybe with something like : </p>  <p><code>requestPermissions: ['email https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file']</code> ?</p>  <p>Should I do this every time I want to access the Google Drive of the user ?</p>  <h2>2. Listing Google Docs and creating new</h2>  <p>How can I list and create new Google Docs?</p>  <p>Thanks a lot for your help !</p>
