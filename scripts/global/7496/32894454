<p>I am trying to programmatically create events with the Google Calendar API (<a href="https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/v3/reference/events" rel="nofollow">https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/v3/reference/events</a>) that are tied to calendar resources (<a href="https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/calendar-resource" rel="nofollow">https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/calendar-resource</a>), but I cannot find any documentation on how to do so.</p>
