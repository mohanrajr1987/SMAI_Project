<p>what am trying to do is check if the video entered by the users really exists or not , I have searched a lot and found this : <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/2.0/developers_guide_php?csw=1#Retrieving_Video_Entry" rel="nofollow">ReRetrieving_Video_Entry</a> , but it looks like it deprecated, so how is it possible using <code>Google APIs Client Library for PHP</code> to check if video exists or not?</p>
