<p>I'm having an issue not getting through to the authentication window for the Google Drive api. My code works in my testfile(index.html) on my local http-server(localhost:8080) but when i try to implement the same code in the "official" testfile cv.php that is running on an IIS.</p>  <p>Whenever i try to iniate the apiload function(by pressing the GoogleBtn div) while browsing the cv.php file im presented with an error saying that it can't read authorized of undefined(undefined being gapi.auth).</p>  <p>The only difference between my index.html file and the other testfile is that mine is html and the other one is php. Is this why I'm returned with this error-message? Would I need to use the php way of authing to google-drive-api?</p>  <p>When console.logging the gapi object in my index.html file(Google-Drive picker works in here) I get these properties(auth:, loader_0:, loader_1:, widget:, platform:)</p>  <p>If I console.log the gapi object in my php file(Google Drive picker doesn't work here, uses same html as index) it's missing a couple of properties(auth, widget, platform)</p>  <p>One thing to note is that the gapi-object in the php file is missing a couple of properties after being loaded(which is the reason I'm returned with that error-message)</p>  <p><strong>Link to error-message after trying to auth in the cv.php file:</strong>  </p>  <pre><code>Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'authorize' of undefined onAuthApiLoad @ googledrive.js:9 (anonymous function) @ api.js:7G @  api.js:1r.(anonymous function).b @ api.js:7r.(anonymous function) @  api.js:7D.(anonymous function) @ api.js:7(anonymous function) @ cb=gapi.loaded_0:1 api.js:8 Uncaught TypeError: _.Rp is not a function(anonymous function) @ cb=gapi.loaded_2:8(anonymous function) @ api.js:5X @ api.js:8oa @ api.js:5T @ api.js:7r.(anonymous function).b @ api.js:7r.(anonymous function) @ api.js:7D.(anonymous function) @ api.js:7(anonymous function) @ cb=gapi.loaded_2:1 </code></pre>  <p><strong>Link to Javascript-Code:</strong> <a href="https://gyazo.com/98e70b1fc282ab97caaf7230547724c3" rel="nofollow">https://gyazo.com/98e70b1fc282ab97caaf7230547724c3</a></p>  <p><strong>Link to index/php-Code:</strong> <a href="https://gyazo.com/96a6704e05ced988e6c44a55a5aabce0" rel="nofollow">https://gyazo.com/96a6704e05ced988e6c44a55a5aabce0</a> (The script is loaded in the end of the  tag)</p>  <p>Very grateful if someone could help me spot what I'm doing wrong.</p>
