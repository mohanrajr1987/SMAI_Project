<p>I used to have in my <code>Podfile</code> following line:</p>  <pre><code>pod 'Google-API-Client', '~&gt; 1.0' </code></pre>  <p>However I've noticed we're using only few of the libraries, so I've decided to download only selected modules. That's why I've changed this line with:</p>  <pre><code>pod 'Google-API-Client/YouTube', '~&gt; 1.0' </code></pre>  <p>However, even if I delete <code>Pods</code> folder and <code>Podfile.lock</code>, still whole library installs. I've tried both with <code>pod update</code> and <code>pod install</code>. I've thought I've filled the name of the <code>subspec</code> wrongly, and tried with the following (instead of the above):</p>  <pre><code>pod 'Google-API-Client/Calendar', '~&gt; 1.0' </code></pre>  <p>But this also fetches the whole Google API.</p>  <p>Here are the subspecs: <a href="https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs/blob/master/Specs/Google-API-Client/1.0.422/Google-API-Client.podspec.json" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs/blob/master/Specs/Google-API-Client/1.0.422/Google-API-Client.podspec.json</a></p>  <p>The console outputs (I'm using <code>CocoaPods 0.38.2</code>):</p>  <pre><code>Update all pods Updating local specs repositories  Analyzing dependencies Downloading dependencies Using Google-API-Client (1.0.422) Using gtm-http-fetcher (1.0.141) Using gtm-oauth2 (1.0.126) Generating Pods project Integrating client project Sending stats </code></pre>  <p>The <code>Podfile</code>:</p>  <pre><code>source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git' source 'ssh://.../PrivateCocoapods'  inhibit_all_warnings!  link_with 'MyProject', 'MyProject Tests'  #pod 'Google-API-Client', '~&gt; 1.0' #pod 'Google-API-Client/YouTube', '~&gt; 1.0' pod 'Google-API-Client/Calendar', '~&gt; 1.0' </code></pre>  <p>If that matters, I'm using <code>Xcode 7.1 Beta</code> and the project is for iOS only. Both the project and <code>Google-API-Client</code> are Objective-C, not Swift. The workspace doesn't contain even single line in Swift.</p>
