<p>How can one create/import a calendar by its url with the <a href="https://developers.google.com/googleapps/calendar/v3/reference" rel="nofollow">Google Calendar API</a>? You can absolutely do it manually in the browser. Where/Which is that method? Is it even possible with v3? Google searches have not brought light into the dark.</p>
