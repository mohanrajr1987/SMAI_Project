<p>So I created a google maps API key so I can make more requests a day. My php file works perfectly without key, i just added billing and got a key so i can make more requests.</p>  <p>But once i add the key to my php file, it all stops working.</p>  <p>I also added my web-servers IP addresses to the google maps settings, but no luck. Here is what my php file looks like:</p>  <pre><code>// given two addresses, work out the driving time in meters function getDistanceForAddresses ($address1, $address2){     // format the URL to the Google Directions API      // https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions     $url = "https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/directions/json?key=MY_KEY_HERE&amp;origin=".urlencode($address1)."&amp;destination=".urlencode($address2);     $c = curl_init( $url );     curl_setopt( $c, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true );     // make the HTTP request to get the directions     $page = curl_exec( $c );     curl_close( $c );      // got some data, parse out the bits we need     $parsed = json_decode( $page, true );      // just take the first route and leg in the response     // because this is PHP we can just do this without checking     // the response      $route = $parsed ['routes'][0];     $leg = $route ['legs'][0];     $distance = $leg['distance'];     $value = $distance['value'];      // we hopefully have a value, if not, we return zero     return sizeof($value) &gt; 0 ? $value : 0; }  // work out how far we are from the two addresses $distance = getDistanceForAddresses("407 9th ave sw calgary, AB, Canada", $location_GUEST); </code></pre>
