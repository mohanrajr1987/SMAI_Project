<p>I am using Debian 7 and Chromium browser.</p>  <p>I'm setting up OAuth authentication via google developer console, but for some reason when I enter <a href="https://console.developers.google.com" rel="nofollow">https://console.developers.google.com</a>, browser starts loading the page, saying "Waiting for console.developers.google.com" and is stuck forever.</p>  <p>Once in ~7 times it eventually loads the page, but then when I click on any tab, it freezes again.</p>  <p>Anyone experienced something like that?</p>
