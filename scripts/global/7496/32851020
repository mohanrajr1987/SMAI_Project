<p>everyone. I'm working with the Search Console API. I'm authenticated and getting data -- but not all that I'm hoping for.</p>  <p>The docs say that I can request 5,000 rows at a time. But when I set the setrowLimit parameter like this:</p>  <pre><code>$request-&gt;setRowLimit(5000); </code></pre>  <p>I get 127 rows returned, with text at the very bottom of the result set that says 'more elements...' -- almost as if it's a paginated result set.</p>  <p>How do I get to those 'more elements'?</p>  <p>Edit: At the top of my result set, I see this response;</p>  <pre><code>array (size=5000) </code></pre>  <p>So it definitely appears there are 5,000 results in the array, I just don't know how to get them all.</p>
