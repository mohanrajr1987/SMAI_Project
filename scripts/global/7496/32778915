<p>I have a tool (written in Python - Tkinter) which is used to create blogs with Tumblr, Wordpress and Google-Blogger API. But if I want to submit a blog to the google index I have to do it manually using this site:  <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/submit-url" rel="nofollow">https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/submit-url</a></p>  <p>I haven`t found something yet which I can use in my Python Tkinter GUI. I need something like a Button. If I click this button it grabs a given URL and submits it to the google index.</p>  <p>Does google offer such a function?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>  <p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>  <p>Or is there maybe a way to parse the google-new-content website with python, find the input field and fill in the URL there and submit it this way? </p>
