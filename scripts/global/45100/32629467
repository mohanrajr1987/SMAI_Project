<p>I am using Retrofit 2.0 to consume web APIs. I am able to send request as Object Body and parse response as Object as well But In may login API I have cookie and some other important headers used to maintain user session.</p>  <p>What I want is  Just want to  pass request object and get response object with HTTP status code and all required headers set to response object.</p>  <p>I don't want to get header values from response body on main thread.</p>  <p>I think I have to use OkHttp interceptors or make custom Gson converter but not able to get idea to get started.</p>
