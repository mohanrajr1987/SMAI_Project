<p>Please consider an abstract class named <code>AbstractClass</code> as well as classes <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> that inherit from it. I'm storing data in a <code>HashMap&lt;String, AbstractClass&gt;</code>, where the String is the class name (in this case, "A" or "B"):</p>  <pre><code>hashmap.put("A", new A()); hashmap.put("B", new B()); </code></pre>  <p>The HashMap is subject to serialization. When deserializing, how can I tell GSON to infer the type of the classes based on the String key? </p>
