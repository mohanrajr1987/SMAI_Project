<p>I'm new on Retrofit and I have some doubts about how to use it in Android. I have a model with four fields (id, password, firstName and lastName), and I want to do two different POST calls from the same object but with different fields. On the one hand, I want to create a login call with the id and password. And, on the other hand, I want to create another call with the firstName and lastName. I'm using the @Expose annotation with the serialized=true, but then the 4 fields are being always sent. Is there a way to send different fields depending on the call? I've seen that I could use a type adapter but I don't know how I does it work.  I'm using the version 2.0.0 from Retrofit.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
