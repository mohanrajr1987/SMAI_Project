<p>is it advisable to use gson.fromJson or gson.toJson in the main UI thread instead of using asyncTask?</p>  <p>Every now and then I will convert an array of java objects or a single java object into Json string, store it in the SharedPreferences, retrieve this Json string from the SharedPreferences, and convert it back to an array of java objects or a single java object.</p>  <p>As of current, most of my conversions are done on the main UI thread. Will it causes ANR or Crash at times?</p>  <p>Any advice helps and greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.</p>
