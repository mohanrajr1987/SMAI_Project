<p>I'm new in Swift and even in object oriented programming languages itself. So my question is, how to use this very extensive language Swift the right way? I give an example to verify my problem:</p>  <p>Let's say I have got two classes: </p>  <ol> <li><p>Class ScanForBluetoth{} //Handles all parts to scan for BT devices</p>  <pre><code>class ScanForDevices: UIViewController, CBCentralManagerDelegate , CBPeripheralDelegate, UITableViewDelegate,UITableViewDataSource{} </code></pre></li> <li><p>Class Bluetooth{} //Handles only the Bluetooth parts with it's delegates</p>  <pre><code>class Bluetooth: ScanForDevices{} </code></pre></li> </ol>  <p>Now, I would like to implement all my used delegates and other Bluetooth specific functions into the Bluetooth class. BUT I need some objects (for example of the CBCentralManagerDelegate) in my ScanForDevices class, too. So, I have to implement all my delegates in my "mother" class ScanForDevices although I only need some properties. SO if I implement the delegates, I have to be conform with the protocol and must implement ALL my needed delegate functions... At the end I have implemented all my delegate functions in ScanForDevices and then override them in Bluetooth. But I don't think that my way is the best way to realize this problem... Thanks for reading!</p>
