<p>I read about delegates and lambda expressions, but this code is still magic for me.</p>  <pre><code>    OnFailure FailureCallback(string failedFunction){         return failureResponse =&gt; Console.Error.WriteLine("Failed to " + failedFunction + " due to: " + failureResponse.Message);     } </code></pre>  <p>Where <em>OnFailure</em> is delegate with signature:</p>  <pre><code>public delegate void OnFailure(FailureResponse failureResponse); </code></pre>  <p>And <em>FailureResponse</em> is class that preforms actions with failure response.</p>  <p>What makes "failureResponse" appear from nowhere at callback? This is not parameter and is not declared anywhere, but yet it's used as a parameter for lambda expression.</p>
