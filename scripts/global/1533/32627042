<p>Even if similar questions are already posted, I still haven't found a solution. In XAML I have this kind of "binding" that works good:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;Controls:MyCustomControl MyCustomAction="{x:Static staticTest:TestDelegate.myConverterAction}" [...]&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Now, I need to set the <code>MyCustomAction</code> property (that is a delegate property) in this way but via code. Is there a way to make a <code>x:Static</code> bind in XAML using C#?</p>
