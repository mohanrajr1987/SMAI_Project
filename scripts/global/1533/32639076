<p>Navigation starts, all the delegate methods are set and everything works as intended.</p>  <p>But if a user switches to another ViewController, while navigation is still on, and returns to the navigation view controller, something happens with the navigation delegate, and all navigation delegate methods are unresponsive.</p>  <p>I of course tried setting them again</p>  <pre><code>[SKRoutingService sharedInstance].navigationDelegate = self; </code></pre>  <p>even tried setting them first to nil and then setting them to self again</p>  <pre><code>[SKRoutingService sharedInstance].navigationDelegate = nil; [SKRoutingService sharedInstance].navigationDelegate = self; </code></pre>  <p>But it doesn't work.</p>  <p>So my questions are: </p>  <p>Can I even set the navigation delegate, after the navigation has started?</p>  <p>What could be the general cause of the ViewController "loosing" delegate?</p>  <p>P.S. I tried not setting delegates to another view controller, when I switch between them (even though I have a map on that other one as well, but didn't work out). As soon as I change my NavigationView controller by segueing to another one, navigationDelegate methods become unresponsive.</p>
