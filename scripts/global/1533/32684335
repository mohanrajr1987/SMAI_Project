<p>I am using a custom cell class with a button in it.  </p>  <pre><code>import UIKit  protocol TouchDelegateForShotsCell {     func touchedTwitterButton() }  class ShotsCell : UITableViewCell {      let touchDelegateForShotsCell: TouchDelegateForShotsCell = MasterViewController()      @IBAction func twitterButtonPressed(sender: AnyObject) {          touchDelegateForShotsCell.touchedTwitterButton()     } } </code></pre>  <p>When the button is pressed I call a delegate function in the MasterViewController which contains the following standard code for sharing on Twitter:  </p>  <pre><code>func touchedTwitterButton() {     var shareToTwitter :SLComposeViewController = SLComposeViewController(forServiceType: SLServiceTypeTwitter)     self.presentViewController(shareToTwitter, animated: true, completion: nil) } </code></pre>  <p>I receive the error :</p>  <blockquote>   <p>"Attempt to present ViewController whose view is not in the window hierarchy!".</p> </blockquote>  <p>I've tried several workarounds. For example, creating a separate view controller and performing a segue from the button. That works in part, however, when I try to pass data I get another error : </p>  <blockquote>   <p>"'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: Receiver ViewController has no segue with identifier 'segueToTwitterShare'".  </p> </blockquote>  <p>Which isn't true.  For this I tried deleting my app and restarting xcode which worked for some people.  However, the problem persists.</p>
