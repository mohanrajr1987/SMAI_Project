<p>I have an app that uses pushkit (voip push). Most of the time the pushes get through. But when there is a lot of traffic, the pushes don't get through to the app.  I am in a state where I can somehow reproduce the error. </p>  <p>I used the extended logging from here:  <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/technotes/tn2265/_index.html" rel="nofollow">https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/technotes/tn2265/_index.html</a></p>  <p>And I found this to examine the logging:  <a href="http://iosdevelopertips.com/core-services/debug-failed-push-messages-by-logging-apsd-process.html" rel="nofollow">http://iosdevelopertips.com/core-services/debug-failed-push-messages-by-logging-apsd-process.html</a></p>  <p>Still, I got two different cases, where I just don't get further:  - In the apsd-log I get</p>  <pre><code>Received message for enabled topic ... </code></pre>  <p>and in the app the didReceiveIncomingPushWithPayload is not called. I produce a log entry right at the start of the function and do nothing special that could prevent the function from finishing.  - In the apsd-log I get</p>  <pre><code>Stream error occurred ... </code></pre>  <p>but do not find any other error messages, why this error occurs.  The Port seems ok</p>  <p>After restarting the app the pushes get through again. </p>  <p>EDIT: </p>  <p>The relevant error in the log file seems to be: </p>  <pre><code>apsd[82]: Failed sending message to client: com.apple.telephonyutilities.callservicesdaemon.voip.push.development </code></pre>  <p>There seems to be two types of cases: In some cases, which are reproducable with large traffic, reregistering the pushkit seems to help. </p>  <p>In other cases, which occur random, it simply does not. Restarting the app does not help here either.  All helps so far, is restarting the iphone. </p>  <p>Does anybody know anything else on this? </p>
