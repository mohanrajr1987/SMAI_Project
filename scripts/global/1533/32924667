<p>I am developing an application using Xcode 7 and Swift 2. I recently discovered an error in my code. In the debugger log (I think that is what it is called) , it printed this: </p>  <pre><code>[AppDeveloper] ADBannerView: Unhandled error (no delegate or delegate does not implement didFailToReceiveAdWithError:): Error Domain=ADErrorDomain Code=7 "Ad was unloaded from this banner" UserInfo={ADInternalErrorCode=7, NSLocalizedFailureReason=Ad was unloaded from this banner, ADInternalErrorDomain=ADErrorDomain} </code></pre>  <p>I did some research and found out that I needed this code:</p>  <pre><code>iAdBannerView.delegate = self </code></pre>  <p>In my <code>viewDidLoad</code> method. I tried it, and I no longer recieved the error. However, I have two viewControllers. Both contain iAds. In the original view controller, ViewController.swift, the code workds. In the view controller that I later added, AboutViewContoller, I get this error:</p>  <pre><code>Cannot assign a value of type 'AboutViewController' to a value of type 'ADBannerViewDelegate?" </code></pre>  <p>Could someone please show me my error in my code?</p>
