<p>While using timers, stopwatches and threads is the standard way, I was wondering if there was a way to create a Winform Application in c# which had a label with initial value as 0 and which automatically kept on incrementing once a button is clicked and when the same button is clicked again it should pause. Personally, I feel that the trick is to use multicast delegates. But I am stuck as to how to proceed.</p>  <p>NOTE: Possible use of method callback and InvokeRequired().</p>
