<p>I am making an app that use Core Dropbox SDK and make sync of all file and folders from document directory. Now I want to make that thing global so any one can integrate that in their app but problem is when I call method of global Viewcontroller it run that method but didn't run Dropbox delegate method so how can make that work.</p>  <pre><code>///This is method that i am calling from another viewcontroller     -(void)startsync{     self.restClient = [[DBRestClient alloc] initWithSession:[DBSession sharedSession]]; self.restClient.delegate = self; [self.restClient loadMetadata:@"/"]; } </code></pre>  <p>but this doesn't work dropbox delegate method when I call this method from another viewcontroller</p>  <pre><code>/// call this method from another viewcontroller ListVC *list = [[ListVC alloc]init]; [list startsync]; </code></pre>
