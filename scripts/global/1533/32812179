<p>Beginner here. I'm trying to call a method in c# depending on the user input: For instance;</p>  <pre><code>    Console.WriteLine("Enter input:");     string cmd = Console.ReadLine(); </code></pre>  <p>user types in: Method1 or Method2 and then that method is called.</p>  <p>I do not what to use  conditional statements or case switching; I'm trying to do this with delegates.</p>  <p>This is what I started with:</p>  <pre><code>public delegate void RunComm(string arg1, string arg2);   Console.WriteLine("Enter input:"); string cmd = Console.ReadLine();  RunComm runthis = RunComm(cmd);  public static void Method1(){  //Run Code }  public static void Method2(){  //Run Code } </code></pre>  <p>I am trying to do the above and I need it to work in a similar fashion as above, but after reading and watching tutorials online I am finding that the above doesn't work.</p>  <p>Does anyone know why? If delegates are not the answer here, does anyone know what is? Any sample code you can share?</p>
