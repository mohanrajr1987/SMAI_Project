<p>I have a Menu which is the shown by <code>revealViewController.rearViewController</code>.  One of the options on the menu is to go to a LeaderBoard.  If the user is logged in the user should be directed to <code>loginViewController</code>.  However, the <code>rearViewController</code> needs to be dismissed and then the <code>LoginViewController</code> needs to be displayed <code>modallyOverCurrentContext</code>.  The problem is once the <code>revealToggleViewController</code> has been toggled I need the <code>frontViewController</code> to know to present the LoginViewController modally.</p>  <p>If I do the following: </p>  <pre><code>[self.revealViewController revealToggleAnimated:YES]; [self performSegueWithIdentifier:@"loginView" sender:self]; </code></pre>  <p>the second line self will be nil by the time it tries to execute.  How can I find out what the frontViewController is and ask that ViewController to present the loginViewController modally. </p>
