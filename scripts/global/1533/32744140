<p>I have some C# code that I am converting to VB.NET.</p>  <p>In a class I have the following:</p>  <pre class="lang-cs prettyprint-override"><code>public class ServiceCapServerLib : ICapServerLib {     private readonly dynamic _lib;      public void AddMessageReceivedHandler(ICapServerLib.MessageReceivedEventHandler action)     {         _lib.MessageReceived += action;     } } </code></pre>  <p>My VB Equivalent of this should be:</p>  <pre class="lang-vb prettyprint-override"><code>Option Strict Off  Public Class ServerCapServerLib     Implements ICapServerLib      Private ReadOnly _lib As Object      Public Sub AddMessageReceivedHandler(ByVal action As ICapServerLib.MessageReceivedEventHandler) Implements ICapServerLib.AddMessageReceivedHandler         AddHandler _lib.MessageReceived, action     End Sub End Class </code></pre>  <p>But it fails to compile with "MessageReceived is not a member of Object". This is obviously the case but the C# code works, so am I missing something?</p>  <p>EDIT: I also tried <code>AddHandler _lib.MessageReceived, AddressOf action</code> but this gives the error "'AddressOf' operand must be the name of a method (without parentheses)"</p>
