<p>I've developed a social media app.</p>  <p>After iOS 9 launched, I've got a message </p>  <p><code>BSXPCMessage received error for message: Connection interrupted  XPC connection interrupted Terminating since there is no system app.</code> </p>  <p>and the simulator reboots by itself. and a real iPhone too.</p>  <p>when I touched <code>UITextView</code> on <code>UIToolbar</code> in CommentViewController. it's like text input UI of Message App, the base iOS app.</p>  <p><code>SIGKILL</code> always occurs at any of lines in <code>textViewDidBeginEditing:</code> of <code>UITextView</code>'s delegate methods, but not happen in textViewShouldBeginEditing:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/lSsUA.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/lSsUA.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>But still works well in iOS 8.</p>  <p><a href="https://github.com/skela/THChatInput" rel="nofollow">THChatInput</a>, <a href="https://github.com/slackhq/SlackTextViewController" rel="nofollow">SlackTextViewController</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jessesquires/JSQMessagesViewController" rel="nofollow">JSQMessagesViewController</a> , etc, I used many libraries, but all of those show me same crash.</p>  <p>I've already read a few of articles about this bug here, but their problem were caused by using CoreImage. unfortunately, I don't use anything about CoreImage</p>  <p>I appreciate in advance for helping me.
