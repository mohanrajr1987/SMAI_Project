<p>I’m aware of the reiterative kind of questions about this topic, but I still can’t find a proper answer anywhere.</p>  <p>The view controller that receives data implements the delegate method and sets the delegate to self. The sending view controller fires the method, so the receiver gets the data. So far so good. But when I jump back to my receiving view controller, a new instance of this view controller is created and I’ve lost my data again. How do you avoid this problem? What am I missing? Thanks a lot.</p>
