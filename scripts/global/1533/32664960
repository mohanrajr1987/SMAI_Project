<p>I understand <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/31934786/3681880">how to send data to a <strong>child</strong> View Controller</a> when calling it with a segue. I think I also understand <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LHDsSWc680" rel="nofollow">how to send data to a <strong>parent</strong> View Controller</a> through the use of protocols and delegates. But how do I send data to a <strong>grandparent</strong> View Controller?</p>  <p>Options that I've considered:</p>  <ul> <li>Send the data to the parent and have the parent send it to the grandparent. But this seems like a lot of extra work when then parent doesn't need to know.</li> <li>Use <code>NSNotificationCenter</code>. But (1) it is only the grandparent that needs to know, not the whole world, and (2) from the scant Swift documentation that I've found, <code>NSNotificationCenter</code> seems very unSwiftlike.</li> </ul>
