<p>I think I'm using protocols in a way that shouldn't work... but it does. Can someone tell me if what I'm doing is okay?</p>  <p><strong>Example</strong></p>  <p>Let's say my app has three view controllers: MainView, SecondaryView, EditorView. The EditorView has buttons that should run code in the other views. I have a protocol which allows me to trigger functions remotely. </p>  <p>Here's the weird thing, the thing I'm doing that maybe I shouldn't... but it's working: Both MainView and SecondaryView conform to the same protocol. I don't understand why it works, but it does.</p>  <p>When I am in MainView and I load the EditorView and, for example, click "Add", the code in the MainView runs and works. </p>  <p>When I am in SecondaryView and I load the EditorView and click "Add", the code in the SecondaryView runs and works.</p>  <p><strong>Question</strong></p>  <p>If this is okay, how is it figuring out which (Main vs Secondary) to delegate to? If it's not okay, why is it working? </p>
