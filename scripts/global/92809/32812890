<p>I am trying to create an PFobject in parse called userFriendRelationships. The object is meant to store two User pointers and another field called status.  I don't want to use the relationship method in parse because I need the additional field status.  Unfortunately, I am getting the following error when I try to save the object. It works when I make an object when both User pointers belong to [PFUser currentUser], but it will crash when I set one of the objects to a different user.  The code throws the error:</p>  <p>Caught "NSInternalInconsistencyException" with reason "User cannot be saved unless they have been authenticated via logIn or signUp":</p>  <p>My Code is as follows:</p>  <pre><code>PFObject *userFriendRequest = [PFObject objectWithClassName:@"userFriendRequests"];                 [userFriendRequest setObject:myUserContact forKey:@"invited"];                 [userFriendRequest setObject:[PFUser currentUser] forKey:@"inviter"];                 [userFriendRequest setObject:@"pending" forKey:@"status"];                 [userFriendRequest saveInBackgroundWithBlock:^(BOOL succeeded, NSError *error){                     if (succeeded) {                         UILabel *disclosureLabel = [[UILabel alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, 65, 21)];                         disclosureLabel.backgroundColor = [UIColor whiteColor];                         disclosureLabel.textColor = [UIColor greenColor];                         [disclosureLabel setText:@"Invited"];                         [cell setAccessoryView:disclosureLabel];                         [[self.allKnownUsers objectAtIndex:indexPath.row] setObject:@"pending" forKey:@"status"];                         [self.tableView reloadData];                      }                     else {                         //NSLog(@"Error %@",error);                         [cell setAccessoryView:nil];                      }                  }]; </code></pre>  <p>I have tried variations where, I first query for a PFUser myUserContact as follows:</p>  <pre><code>PFUser *myUserContact = objects[0]; </code></pre>  <p>as well as trying:</p>  <pre><code>PFUser *myUserContact = [PFObject objectWithoutDataWithClassName:@"_User" objectId:@"GI7CEb2TH6"]; </code></pre>  <p>and:</p>  <pre><code>PFUser *myUserContact = [PFUser objectWithoutDataWithObjectId:@"GI7CEb2TH6"]; </code></pre>  <p>Same error each time.  There are no ACLs or CLPs set on the userFriendRequests table.</p>
