<p>I don't know is SO is the best place to ask this, but this is related to iOS development so here it goes :</p>  <p>For development purposes, I have kept an iPhone under iOS 7. With the official release of iOS 9 coming soon, I will probably drop support for iOS 7 and need to upgrade this iPhone to iOS 8 (again, for development purposes).</p>  <p>My question : Will it be possible to upgrade to iOS 8 (from iOS 7) once iOS 9 is out, or will the iPhone only let me upgrade directly to iOS 9 ?</p>  <p>Thanks (and please don't make any guesses, I'd like a definite answer, maybe from someone who experienced this situation last year)</p>
