<p>I have read on the Delphi forums that xcode 6.4 / ios 8.4 sdk works with Delphi Seattle when targeting ios7 (Iphone4), ios8 and ios9 ... But not if I am using xcode 7</p>  <p>However, assuming I aleady have xcode 7 installed, what is the best way to have Delphi use xcode 6.4? Can I somehow point Delphi to use that instead? </p>  <p>What about commandline tools which I have downloaded for xcode 7?</p>  <p>The next question then is if apps will continue to be accepted in app submissions if using xcode 6.4?</p>
