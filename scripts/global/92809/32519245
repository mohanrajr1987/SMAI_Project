<p>I am creating a chat app where user can send my custom smilies or emoticons along with the default smilies as a chat message. In the app, there is also a provision to change the text size (between 14,16,18 font size).The problem is that when I add both my custom smilies and the default smilies. the size mismatches.I have also attached the screen shot for the same. Could anybody let me know what would be the approach to achieve the following? The rectangle which is empty contains my system emoji and is bigger in size. Please suggest.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ntlE9.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ntlE9.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
