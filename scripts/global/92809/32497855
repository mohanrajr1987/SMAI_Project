<p>My application deployment target is iOS 7.0 I want to use method <code>systemFontOfSize(fontSize: weight:)</code> on devices with iOS 8+. iOS 7 doesn't support this method (with <code>weight:</code> parameter) and my application crashes. Specially for iOS 7 I want to set Helvetica Light font instead of SystemFont Light.</p>  <p>What is the best way to check it? Do I need to check iOS version or I can check the method? how?</p>  <p>I use swift and tried </p>  <pre><code>if let font = UIFont.systemFontOfSize(12, weight: UIFontWeightLight)  </code></pre>  <p>or</p>  <p><code>respondsToSelector</code> method. It didn't work for me.</p>
