<p>Wondering if anyone has found a way to run Xcuitests in parallel. Pretty sure this functionality isn't built in but it may be possible to write a script that can spread it over multiple machines if you can run a specific Xcuitest from the command line. </p>  <p>So sub question, how do you run a specific Xcuitest from the command line?</p>  <p>I'd appreciate it if anyone's played around with this and can share what they've learned or if they have any resources they could point me to. Thanks!</p>
