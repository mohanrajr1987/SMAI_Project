<p>I want to create an app with one of the screens being a 3D rotating object (let's say a box with a texture applied to it). Since Metal and SceneKit are not available in iOS7 and OpenGL doesn't seem to be fully supported in swift (the starter project has a lot of "Not working..." stuff in it), what are my options for creating such app without using any 3rd party frameworks like cocos2d?</p>
