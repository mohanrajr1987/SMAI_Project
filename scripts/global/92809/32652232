<p>I have in my application a UIWebView that is it used often to display informatin to the user.</p>  <p>I have a requirement that is that the user should be able to change the font size of that web view to display the text bigger or smaller.</p>  <p>What I've done is to hook up two buttons in my ViewController that calls a JS script in my web view that changes the HTML body font size.</p>  <p>It is working nice, but if the user changes in the iPhone Settings the text size it doesn't affect my web view fonts.</p>  <p>Is it possible to use something like the methods preferredFontForTextStyle in a UIWebView natively?</p>
