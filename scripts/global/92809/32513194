<p>I've upgraded my Xcode 7 beta version to Xcode 7 GM but I am missing iOS 7.1 simulators. I still have Xcode 6 and I can use 7.1 simulators there. I tried to look in <code>Preferences -&gt; Downloads</code> but there are only 8.x simulators.</p>  <p>I have <code>Deployment Target</code> set to 7.0. I can get app working with 7.1 simulator in Xcode 7 beta 6. </p>  <p>So where is the problem? Before final release Apple remove 7.x simulators but I'll find them with production release? Is it possible to enable these simulators now? Thanks</p>  <p><strong>Edit:</strong> I was looking at directory with Xcode 6 </p>  <pre><code>/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs </code></pre>  <p>and I have there only <code>iPhoneSimulator.sdk</code> and <code>iPhoneSimulator8.4.sdk</code> which reference to first one. In Xcode 7 I have same situation with two folders <code>iPhoneSimulator.sdk</code> and <code>iPhoneSimulator9.0.sdk</code>. So where is 7.1 Simulator folder? Is it possible that it is somewhere else? Because as I wrote I have 7.1 as options for simulators and when I go to <code>Preferences -&gt; Downloads</code> in Xcode 6 I have 7.1 simulators downloaded.</p>  <p>If Xcode 7 don't get 7.x simulators then how can I test my apps to 7.x iOS when I want to use Xcode 7 Swift 2.0 for development? And when I don't have any device with iOS 7.x</p>
