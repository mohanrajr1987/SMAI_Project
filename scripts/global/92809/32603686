<p>How do I distinguish, while the app is in the UIApplicationStateInactive state, between, the receiving vs the clicking of a push notification? In this state, the app is launched and not in the background, and occurs when the user is on a phone call, looking at the notification centre (swipe down from the top), etc.</p>  <p>I am using didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler: and require "content_available=true".</p>  <p>It was mentioned <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22085234/didreceiveremotenotification-fetchcompletionhandler-open-from-icon-vs-push-not/22085855#comment49008641_22085855">here</a> that <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/22085855/1670794">this</a> solution is insufficient, but there is no other mention of any solutions to this issue.</p>  <p>It is true that most of the time, the app would get 2 calls from the push notification. However, if the app is terminated while the push notification is sent, there would only be 1 call which occurs when the user presses the notification. (Which means I cannot rely on this)</p>  <pre><code>- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary *)userInfo fetchCompletionHandler:(void (^)(UIBackgroundFetchResult))completionHandler {  if(application.applicationState == UIApplicationStateInactive) {      NSLog(@"Inactive");      //Show the view with the content of the push      //This triggers for both cases      completionHandler(UIBackgroundFetchResultNewData);  } else if (application.applicationState == UIApplicationStateBackground) {      NSLog(@"Background");      //Refresh the local model      completionHandler(UIBackgroundFetchResultNewData);  } else {      NSLog(@"Active");      //Show an in-app banner      completionHandler(UIBackgroundFetchResultNewData);  } </code></pre>
