<p>This has happened with Xcode Beta (7.0) and Xcode (6.4).</p>  <p>I'm trying to debug my app with my iPhone 4 (iOS 7.1.2) and I set my Deployment Target under iOS 7.0. When I run my app, I can't see the LaunchScreen but instead it's a black blank screen and then it crashes.</p>  <p>I'm not giving any piece of code, because when I create <strong>a new default project</strong>, setting the Deployment Target right, <strong>I get the same crash</strong>.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>2015-09-13 16:06:07.026 GafasApp2[243:60b] -[MasterViewController topViewController]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x14d83420   2015-09-13 16:06:07.033 GafasApp2[243:60b] <strong>* Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: '-[MasterViewController topViewController]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x14d83420'   *</strong> First throw call stack:   (0x30a57f83 0x3b208ccf 0x30a5b917 0x30a5a203 0x309a9768 0x85cc3 0x332e4587 0x332e3edb 0x332de56b 0x3327a6e9 0x33279851 0x332ddca9 0x35892aed 0x358926d7 0x30a22a67 0x30a22a03 0x30a211d7 0x3098bebf 0x3098bca3 0x332dced1 0x332d814d 0x86fbd 0x3b715ab7)   libc++abi.dylib: terminating with uncaught exception of type NSException   (lldb) </p> </blockquote>  <p>I've been always developing with iPad air 2 but now I need my iPhone 4 to test some things, but I can't use it as I mentioned.</p>  <p>Do you have any clue?</p>  <p>Thank you very much.</p>
