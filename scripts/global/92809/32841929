<p>I realized passcode detection as described here -  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6191592/programatically-checking-if-a-passcode-lock-is-set">Programatically Checking if a Passcode Lock is Set</a> , but it only works on iOS 8 and higher.</p>  <p>App crash on this line<code>secRecord.AccessControl = new SecAccessControl (SecAccessible.WhenPasscodeSetThisDeviceOnly);</code> Is it possible programmatically check passcode status on iOS 7 ? I didn't found any information about this.</p>
