<p>So, in my app, I utilize Background Fetch. I also use the Keychain with this for authenticating sessions and requesting data from my backend.</p>  <p>It seems as though Background Fetch is never called when the phone is locked. Is this the case?</p>  <p>Further, I was under the impression that when using Keychain, that whenever my app is in the background, I'd be able to access values stored there as long as I use <code>.AccessibleAfterFirstUnlock</code>.</p>  <p>I'm using that, but whenever the phone is locked and I Simulate Background Fetch via Xcode, my values I get back from the Keychain are <code>nil</code>.</p>  <p>Is this expected? I haven't found any answers about these situations exactly. It seems like when the phone is unlocked that I successfully get values from the Keychain every time.</p>
