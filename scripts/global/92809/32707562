<p>I try to make my physic body become nice with polygon from path .There is no any error when i build on simulation .when i test with my iPhone 5 ( iOS 7.0), my game crash .But with iPhone6 (iOS8.0) everything is fine .I don't get it </p>  <ol start="2"> <li><p>In GameScene</p>  <p>var tree2 = SKSpriteNode()</p>  <p>override func didMoveToView(view: SKView) {</p>  <pre><code>//let between = balloon.size.width*2 // random var movementAmount = arc4random() % UInt32(self.frame.size.width/4) var treeoffset = CGFloat(movementAmount) - self.frame.size.width/8 // move tree  var treemove = SKAction.moveByX(0, y: -self.frame.size.width*2, duration: NSTimeInterval(self.frame.size.height/50)) var treeremove = SKAction.removeFromParent() var treemoveandremove = SKAction.sequence([treemove, treeremove])  // add tree1  var tree2texture = SKTexture(imageNamed: "C1.png") tree2 = SKSpriteNode(texture: tree2texture) tree2.position = CGPointMake(CGRectGetMidX(self.frame) + tree2texture.size().width/2 + treeoffset, CGRectGetMidY(self.frame) + self.frame.size.height) tree2.zPosition = 1 tree2.runAction(treemoveandremove) //tree2.physicsBody = SKPhysicsBody(rectangleOfSize: tree2.size)  let path: CGMutablePathRef = CGPathCreateMutable()   MoveToPoint(path,    x: 215, y: 33, node: tree2) AddLineToPoint(path, x: 62, y: 29, node: tree2) AddLineToPoint(path, x: 57, y: 34, node: tree2) AddLineToPoint(path, x: 52, y: 49, node: tree2) AddLineToPoint(path, x: 55, y: 37, node: tree2) AddLineToPoint(path, x: 36, y: 52, node: tree2) AddLineToPoint(path, x: 46, y: 41, node: tree2) AddLineToPoint(path, x: 38, y: 43, node: tree2) AddLineToPoint(path, x: 48, y: 38, node: tree2) AddLineToPoint(path, x: 56, y: 29, node: tree2) AddLineToPoint(path, x: 44, y: 29, node: tree2) AddLineToPoint(path, x: 21, y: 50, node: tree2) AddLineToPoint(path, x: 38, y: 29, node: tree2) AddLineToPoint(path, x: 18, y: 29, node: tree2) AddLineToPoint(path, x: 14, y: 30, node: tree2) AddLineToPoint(path, x: 12, y: 35, node: tree2) AddLineToPoint(path, x: 13, y: 30, node: tree2) AddLineToPoint(path, x: 9, y: 31, node: tree2) AddLineToPoint(path, x: 16, y: 28, node: tree2) AddLineToPoint(path, x: 0, y: 27, node: tree2) AddLineToPoint(path, x: 8, y: 26, node: tree2) AddLineToPoint(path, x: 5, y: 23, node: tree2) AddLineToPoint(path, x: 12, y: 26, node: tree2) AddLineToPoint(path, x: 25, y: 25, node: tree2) AddLineToPoint(path, x: 20, y: 23, node: tree2) AddLineToPoint(path, x: 14, y: 21, node: tree2) AddLineToPoint(path, x: 19, y: 21, node: tree2) AddLineToPoint(path, x: 10, y: 16, node: tree2) AddLineToPoint(path, x: 29, y: 24, node: tree2) AddLineToPoint(path, x: 39, y: 23, node: tree2) AddLineToPoint(path, x: 30, y: 18, node: tree2) AddLineToPoint(path, x: 43, y: 24, node: tree2) AddLineToPoint(path, x: 50, y: 24, node: tree2) AddLineToPoint(path, x: 43, y: 17, node: tree2) AddLineToPoint(path, x: 34, y: 16, node: tree2) AddLineToPoint(path, x: 42, y: 15, node: tree2) AddLineToPoint(path, x: 30, y: 0, node: tree2) AddLineToPoint(path, x: 45, y: 14, node: tree2) AddLineToPoint(path, x: 46, y: 6, node: tree2) AddLineToPoint(path, x: 48, y: 16, node: tree2) AddLineToPoint(path, x: 55, y: 23, node: tree2) AddLineToPoint(path, x: 251, y: 21, node: tree2)  CGPathCloseSubpath(path);  tree2.physicsBody = SKPhysicsBody(polygonFromPath: path)  tree2.physicsBody?.dynamic = false //tree2.physicsBody?.categoryBitMask = objectgroup //tree2.physicsBody?.categoryBitMask = object.TR.rawValue //tree2.physicsBody?.contactTestBitMask = object.BB.rawValue  self.addChild(tree2)      } </code></pre></li> </ol>  <p>The Error is  "CoreFoundation = 847.260000 Assertion failed: (area > 1.19209290e-7F), function ComputeCentroid, file /SourceCache/PhysicsKit/PhysicsKit-6.5.4/PhysicsKit/Box2D/Collision/Shapes/b2PolygonShape.cpp, line 122."</p>  <p>Line 122 :tree2.physicsBody = SKPhysicsBody(polygonFromPath: path)</p>  <p>How can i fix that </p>  <p>Please help me to fix that . </p>  <p>Thanks for advance </p>
