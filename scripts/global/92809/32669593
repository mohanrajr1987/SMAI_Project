<p>My project worked fine with XCode 6 targeting iOS 7.0. Now I upgraded to XCode 7 targeting iOS 8.0 and I get the following error repeatedly:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>2015-09-19 16:40:14.794 MyProject[624:138018]   NSURLSession/NSURLConnection HTTP load failed   (kCFStreamErrorDomainSSL, -9802)</p> </blockquote>  <p>The app doesn't start anymore and I am just facing a black screen.</p>  <p>To my knowledge I don't initiate any HTTP connections, except for the Facebook integration for which I had to set up an URL type (but I already uncommented all related code and removed the URL scheme, still the same problem).</p>  <p>Any ideas how to solve this issue ?</p>
