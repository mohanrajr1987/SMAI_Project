<p>I am an iOS Developer working an application in which I want to list the bluetooth devices names (iPod, iPad, Macbook etc ), for which O am using the MultiPeerConnectivity Framework.</p>  <p>MultiPeerConnectivity  Framework uses <code>MCBrowserViewController</code> which is responsible for browsing nearby devices and <code>MCAdvertiserAssistant</code> which advertise the devices for the connectivity. Using MultiPeerConnectivity Framework you have two devices, one should advertise itself and the second one should browse for the devices, than its working fine.</p>  <p>But My Problem is:<br> How to search for the devices which are not able to use the app (I mean how to search for my Macbook or other bluetooth devices like bluetooth keyboard etc, am not talking about the Android devices). Is it possible through MultiPeerConnectivity Framework ? or any other solution ?</p>  <p>Here is my code</p>  <pre><code>-(void)setupPeerAndSessionWithDisplayName:(NSString *)_displayName {     self.peerID = [[MCPeerID alloc] initWithDisplayName:_displayName];     self.session = [[MCSession alloc] initWithPeer:self.peerID];     self.session.delegate = self; }    -(void)setupMCBrowser{      self.browser = [[MCBrowserViewController alloc] initWithServiceType:@"chat-files" session:self.session]; }    -(void)advertiseSelf:(BOOL)shouldAdvertise{      if (shouldAdvertise) {         self.advertiser = [[MCAdvertiserAssistant alloc] initWithServiceType:@"chat-files" discoveryInfo:nil session:self.session];          [self.advertiser start];     }     else{         [self.advertiser stop];         self.advertiser = nil;     } } </code></pre>
