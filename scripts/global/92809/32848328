<p>I am attempting to use Autolayout with UITableView prototype cells. Anytime I try to constrain something I get a lot of errors. Even something as simple as getting a label to tick on the top left of a cell like this:</p>  <p><a href="http://imgur.com/kMHM2lY" rel="nofollow">http://imgur.com/kMHM2lY</a> (sorry not enough rep points)</p>  <p>Returns the following errors in the log:</p>  <pre><code>2015-09-29 23:33:32.935 AccordionExample[21221:607] Unable to simultaneously satisfy constraints. Probably at least one of the constraints in the following list is one you don't want. Try this: (1) look at each constraint and try to figure out which you don't expect; (2) find the code that added the unwanted constraint or constraints and fix it. (Note: If you're seeing NSAutoresizingMaskLayoutConstraints that you don't understand, refer to the documentation for the UIView property translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints)   ( "&lt;NSLayoutConstraint:0x78946a00 H:|-(8)-[UILabel:0x789464a0]   (Names: '|':UITableViewCellContentView:0x78946380 )&gt;", "&lt;NSLayoutConstraint:0x78946a30 H:[UILabel:0x789464a0]-(84)-|   (Names: '|':UITableViewCellContentView:0x78946380 )&gt;", "&lt;NSAutoresizingMaskLayoutConstraint:0x78949210 h=--&amp; v=--&amp; H:[UITableViewCellContentView:0x78946380(0)]&gt;" )  Will attempt to recover by breaking constraint  </code></pre>  <p></p>  <pre><code>Break on objc_exception_throw to catch this in the debugger. The methods in the UIConstraintBasedLayoutDebugging category on UIView listed in &lt;UIKit/UIView.h&gt; may also be helpful. 2015-09-29 23:33:32.936 AccordionExample[21221:607] Unable to simultaneously satisfy constraints.

If that makes any difference.</p>
