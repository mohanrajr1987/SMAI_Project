<p>In the past when I've used Xcode 6.4, I have been able to adjust things like font sizes, etc. based on device sizes.  This was for my apps that were targeted at iOS 7. Now for Xcode 7 and Swift 2 it only allows for this with iOS 8 and newer. It prompts me to fix it with 3 different option. I can't get any of the choices to work.  Is there a way to adjust things for different devices in Xcode 7 using Swift 2 for older iOS 7 devices?</p>  <p>In Xcode 6.4, It would look like this in my <code>viewDidLoad()</code>:</p>  <pre><code>if UIScreen.mainScreen().nativeBounds.height == 1334.0 {     //Name Details         redLabel.font = UIFont (name: "Arial", size: 13)         yellowLabel.font = UIFont (name: "Arial", size: 13)         greenLabel.font = UIFont (name: "Arial", size: 13)         blueLabel.font = UIFont (name: "Arial", size: 13) } </code></pre>  <p>In Xcode 7 and Swift 2, it gives me an alert <code>'nativeBounds' is only available on iOS 8.0 or newer</code>.  It then prompts to fix it with 3 different possible fixes:</p>  <p>1) If I choose <code>Fix-it Add 'if available' version check</code> it does this:</p>  <pre><code>if #available(iOS 8.0, *) {         if UIScreen.mainScreen().nativeBounds.height == 1136.0 {             //Name Details             redKid.font = UIFont (name: "Arial", size: 13)             yellowKid.font = UIFont (name: "Arial", size: 13)             greenKid.font = UIFont (name: "Arial", size: 13)             blueKid.font = UIFont (name: "Arial", size: 13)         }     } else {         // Fallback on earlier versions     }  </code></pre>  <p>2) If I choose <code>Fix-it Add @available attribute to enclosing instance method</code> it does this:</p>  <pre><code>@available(iOS 8.0, *) override func viewDidLoad() </code></pre>  <p>3) If I choose <code>Fix-it Add @available attribute to enclosing class</code> it does this:</p>  <pre><code>@available(iOS 8.0, *) class ViewController: UIViewController { </code></pre>  <p>How can I fix this and have it run a target of iOS7 and adjust for different device screen sizes? Thank you.</p>
