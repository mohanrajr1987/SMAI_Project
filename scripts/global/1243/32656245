<p>I have this so far:</p>  <pre><code>    tell application "Finder" set number_of_items to (count (every item of the desktop)) set correct_grammar to "" as text  if number_of_items is 1 then     set number_of_items to "one" as text end if  if number_of_items is greater than 1 then     set s_letter to "s" as text end if  set correct_grammar to "are" as text  if number_of_items is 1 then     set correct_grammar to "is" as text end if  if number_of_items is greater than 1 then     set correct_grammar to "are" end if  set s_letter to "s" as text if number_of_items is 1 then     set s_letter to "" as text end if  tell application "System Events"     display dialog "There " &amp; correct_grammar &amp; " " &amp; number_of_items &amp; " file" &amp; s_letter &amp; " in this folder." buttons {"Yes", "Exit"} with title "Test" end tell end tell </code></pre>  <p>I am trying to make a dialog appear showing the text "one" instead of the number value of "1" Once I do this, the script makes it so it stops fixing the grammar. The portion of code below is what makes the issue occur but this is the whole intention of the correct grammar thing.</p>  <pre><code>if number_of_items is 1 then set number_of_items to "one" as text end if </code></pre>
