<p>I've created a macro in Excel that creates a CSV file which is named test[date/time].csv the macro then passes the data/time to an applescript.</p>  <p>What I want that applescript to do is to copy the contents of the CSV file and paste it into a webform. I can copy the CSV contents (i've tried it through keystrokes and copying to clipboard too) but I cannot get it copy the file contents into the web form UNLESS it is only one line - in which case it works fine. I know it must have something to do with the carriage returns or something, but I can't figure it out. Please help!</p>  <p>Here's my code</p>  <pre><code>on run argv     set fileNameTime to (item 1 of argv)     set fileName to "Test" &amp; fileNameTime &amp; ".csv"      tell application "Finder"         set myFolder to container of (path to me) as text     end tell      set srcFileString to (myFolder &amp; fileName)     set theFileReference to open for access srcFileString     set CSVText to read theFileReference     close access theFileReference      tell application "Safari"          open location "https://www.internalbusinesswebsite.com"         delay 2         do JavaScript "document.getElementById('issue-import-csv').value = '" &amp; CSVText &amp; "';" in document 1      end tell end run </code></pre>
