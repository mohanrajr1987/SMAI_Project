<p>There already <em>are</em> web search plugins for Quicksilver but I've got lots of keyword searches in Chrome &amp; so think I've got a more elegant solution:  an AppleScript that simply takes the 1st-pane text - e.g. "google StackExchange" and puts it through the Chrome URL bar. </p>  <p>I'm working on learning AppleScript and modifying existing example but haven't had any luck so far so help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks. This is what I've got so far (unsuccessful):</p>  <pre><code>using terms from application "Quicksilver" on process text _text_  end process text _text_ end using terms   tell application "Google Chrome"             activate             open location "_text_" </code></pre>
