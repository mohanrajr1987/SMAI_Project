<p>Is the process for embedding a custom font different with Cocoa-AppleScript apps?</p>  <p>I have a label that would display a string in this custom font, but it is still defaulting to the system font when packaged and run on a mac that doesn't already have the font installed.</p>  <p>I've dragged the font (ConnectCode39.ttf) to the sidebar in Xcode, and ensured that the app is ticked under target membership.</p>  <p>I've even added <code>Fonts provided by application</code> - <code>CCode39.ttf</code> (The true name of the font, not the file) to the info.plist, although I'm not sure if I still need to do that with the latest Xcode?</p>  <p>I've confirmed that the .ttf file is in the 'Copy Bundled Resources' as well.</p>  <p>The label is currently set to use 'CCode39', although is this picking it up from my Mac's font library?  If so, how do I change it to use the bundled copy of the font?  Or is this part ok and there's something else I'm missing?</p>  <p>Thank you!</p>
