<p>I'm trying to set up an Indesign script that copies the link information of a selected image and appends it to a text file to the desktop, if the text file does not exist it creates one. The link information is copied to the clipboard using a custom key command in inDesign. The problem is if I copy some text or an image beforehand, that text remains on the clipboard. Even though I copy new link info and set that clipboard to a variable.</p>  <p>I know this is an ugly script, I'm just good enough to get by, but barely.  Any suggestions on how to clear out the clipboard?</p>  <p>Thanks, ~David</p>  <hr>  <pre><code>--dialog box  display dialog "What do you need done" default answer "Remove Background" set theAnswer to (text returned of result)    set this_story to "  ------------------- " &amp; theAnswer &amp; " -------------------  " set this_file to (((path to desktop folder) as string) &amp; "Corrections.txt") my write_to_file(this_story, this_file, false)   on write_to_file(this_data, target_file, append_data)     try         set the target_file to the target_file as string         set the open_target_file to open for access file target_file with write permission         if append_data is true then set eof of the open_target_file to 0         write this_data to the open_target_file starting at eof         close access the open_target_file         return true     on error         try             close access file target_file         end try         return false     end try end write_to_file   --copy link information using keyboard short  activate application "Adobe InDesign CC 2015"  tell application "System Events" to keystroke "l" using {shift down, control down}  end  ---  set myVar to the clipboard my write_clip_file(myVar, this_file, false)  on write_clip_file(myVar, target_file, append_data)     try         set the target_file to the target_file as string         set the open_target_file to open for access file target_file with write permission         if append_data is true then set eof of the open_target_file to 0         write myVar to the open_target_file starting at eof         close access the open_target_file         return true     on error         try             close access file target_file         end try         return false     end try end write_clip_file </code></pre>
