<p>I'm using the following AppleScript to determine when the user clicks the stop recording button in the task bar: </p>  <pre><code>tell application "QuickTime Player"     tell document 1         activate         new screen recording         delay 1         tell application "System Events" to key code 49         delay 2         repeat until (new screen recording) is false         end repeat     end tell end tell </code></pre>  <p>Though instead the script keeps relaunching QuickTime. </p>
