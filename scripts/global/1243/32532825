<p>I'm trying to create a script to delete multiple files in the same folder without having to authenticate twice. I've tried a bunch of things but I'm super new to AppleScript and I keep striking out. Any assistance is greatly appreciated.</p>  <pre><code>set colorProfiles to (POSIX file "/Library/ColorSync/Profiles") set coatedToDelete to "Pantone+ Solid Coated.csv" set uncoatedToDelete to "Pantone+ Solid Uncoated.csv"  try     --Notification window with info     display dialog ("This script will automagically delete your outdated Pantone color books. Please make sure an admin is nearby to authenticate (twice) if prompted.") with icon note      --Deletes both Pantone+ .csv files     tell application "Finder"         delete file (coatedToDelete of folder colorProfiles)         delete file (uncoatedToDelete of folder colorProfiles)      end tell     --Successful deletion notification     display dialog ("The outdated color book deletion was successful!") buttons {"Great!"} with icon note   on error     --Error message notification     display dialog ("This script was unable to delete your legacy Pantone color books.") buttons {"OK"} with icon caution end try </code></pre>
