<p>I'm using this AppleScript to cycle through the tabs in Safari for a "dashboard" at work:</p>  <pre><code>tell application "Safari" repeat     repeat with i from (count of tabs of window 1) to 1 by -1         set thisTab to tab i of window 1         set current tab of window 1 to thisTab         delay 10     end repeat end repeat end tell </code></pre>  <p>The problem I am having is that when I put Safari into full screen, I get this error:</p>  <pre><code>error "The variable thisTab is not defined." number -2753 from "thisTab" </code></pre>  <p>Why is this happening and how do I fix it?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
