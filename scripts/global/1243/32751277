<p>I'm trying to automate part of my workflow that involves uploading a series of images through a web page with an AppleScript that calls JavaScript in the already-loaded page.</p>  <p>I've done this sort of automation before, but am hitting a major roadblock when it comes to actually picking the files for upload. I can't set the <code>input.value</code> property (it's not allowed, for security reasons), and I can't even figure out how to get the page to put up the file picker, which I could then hopefully populate. The page uses Angular, in case that helps to come up with a solution.</p>  <p>This is what the page's HTML looks like (the relevant section):</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div class="..."&gt;     &lt;div class="..." ng-class="..."&gt;         &lt;span class="... ng-binding" ng-bind-html="..."&gt;Choose File&lt;/span&gt;         &lt;div class="..."&gt;             &lt;input id="..." type="file" ng-file-select="onFileSelect($files)" multiple=""&gt;         &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>How can I simulate clicking "Choose File" using JavaScript loaded into the page's DOM?</p>
