<p>I'm trying to create an ApplesScript function to automatically save a file every 5 minutes in a program called Tableau. </p>  <p>Here's what I have so far, but I'm stuck at what function to use for "Save" </p>  <pre><code>tell application "Tableau"      if it is running then         &lt;&lt; This is where I want to check if the filename is generic, i.e. starts with "Book" &gt;&gt;         &lt;&lt; If it is generic, this is where I'd want to instruct it to prompt for Save As &gt;&gt;         &lt;&lt; If it is not generic, this is where I'd like to automatically Save the file in its current name and location &gt;&gt; delay 300000 repeat </code></pre>
