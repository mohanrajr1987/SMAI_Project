<p>I'm building a service to create a new file in finder.  The first step runs the following bash script</p>  <pre><code>for f in "$@" do     touch ${f}/untitled.txt done </code></pre>  <p>This creates a file called untitled.txt What I would like to have happen next is to have that file selected and if possible have it be selected to rename, exactly as if I selected the file and pressed rename. Just like it would happen on a windows machine. Then end result would ideally be my finder window looks like this</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/9M8L8.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/9M8L8.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I've tried </p>  <pre><code>tell application "Finder"     set selection to "untitled.txt" end tell </code></pre>  <p>But that produced an error. I am sure this is possible using applescript, but I can't find a good example for it. </p>
