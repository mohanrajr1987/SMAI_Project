<p>I've looked almost everywhere, and I am currently trying to figure out how to change the icon of an application through applescript. As in the actual code to change an icon on my desktop. </p>  <p>I have no idea how I would do this but here is where it would be used.</p>  <pre><code>    set number_of_items to count (items of desktop)  tell application "Finder"      if number_of_items is 1 then             #*Code here*#         end if     end tell </code></pre>  <p>Thanks.</p>
