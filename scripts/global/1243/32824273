<p>To get search results quicker, I'd like to automate my Google searching process with a Shell (BASH) script. Alternatively, I could work with AppleScriptâ€”if that's handier, as I'm on a Mac.</p>  <p>The script should do, in a separate tab, a Google search per value (cell) in a specific column in an Excel file.</p>  <p>Furthermore, it should be able to add a (standard) string to the value in each cell.</p>  <p>For example, in the Excel file, in column A, I'd have a list of first names: "Peter", "Paul", "Jason", "James", "Frank", etc. The script would add the string "Amsterdam" to each value, making "Peter Amsterdam", "Paul Amsterdam", "Jason Amsterdam", etc. The script would, finally, perform a Google search using these latter, concatenated strings as the query, using a separate tab per query.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance for any help!</p>
