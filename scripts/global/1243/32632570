<p>I am trying to run an applescript. The content of the script is not important but I would like to run it at timed intervals until a certain condition is met. For example, I want to click on a menu item in Safari browser if it's available:</p>  <p>The applescript that I want to run:</p>  <pre><code>on menuClick()   tell application "System Events"     tell process "Safari"       click menu item "Simulator" of menu 1 of menu bar item "Develop" of menu bar 1     end tell   end tell end menuClick </code></pre>  <p>The pseudocode of how I would like the script to run (Sorry, my knowledge of applescript is limited):</p>  <pre><code>try   menuClick() catch   run menuClick after 1s </code></pre>  <p>How would the pseudocode look like in Applescript?</p>
