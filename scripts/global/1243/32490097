<p>Forgive me, I'm a bit of an amature.</p>  <p>I'm working to comply with a records request for hundreds of students. All files are named with the first 5 digits of the name being the student's ID number. I created the script below and it runs but with no results.</p>  <p>I would welcome any help that you guys can provide. </p>  <pre><code>with timeout of 3600 seconds tell application "Finder"     set myFiles to files of folder POSIX file "/Volumes/Storage/Records" as alias list end tell repeat with aFile in myFiles     tell application "System Events"         set myvalues to {"11111", "22222", "33333", "44444", "55555", "66666", "77777", "88888", "99999", "00000", "11112", "22223", "33334", "44445", "55556", "66667", "77778", "88889", "99990"}          if name of aFile contains myvalues then             copy aFile to folder POSIX file "/Volumes/Storage/Records"         end if     end tell   end repeat  end timeout </code></pre>
