<p>I need track files being sent out to various vendors.  I store them in a Filemaker database, but have been trying to develop more efficient ways to fill my database.  I created an automator app to create this list for me, but since the "Filter Finder items" relies on Spotlight, it doesn't work on networked drives.</p>  <p>mcgrailm made a slick Applescript that helps me populate a list of the files themselves.  This is sufficient for about 90% of my needs as usually I just need to keep a record that a file has been sent, but sometimes I need to also track the POSIX filepath to tell a recipient where on the drive the files are located.</p>  <p>mcgrailm's script was</p>  <p>tell application "Finder"     set file_list to name of every file of entire contents of (choose folder with prompt "Please select directory.")    end tell</p>  <p>Does anybody know how I can modify this script to give me the full POSIX filepath along with the filename?  I tried modifying but my Applescript skills are pretty lacking.  Thank you</p>
