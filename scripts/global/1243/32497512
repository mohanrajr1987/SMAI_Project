<p>Is there any way to get the last sent e-mail from Mail?  It can only access the top level sent mailbox. </p>  <pre><code>tell application "Mail"     set mabo to the sent mailbox     set selected to messages of mabo     return properties of item 1 of selected end tell </code></pre>  <p>The reason I need this is that I want to get information about the e-mail that is beeing written. My thought was to get the frontmost window.</p>  <pre><code>tell application "Mail"     set the win to windows     set theMessage to item 1 of win     get name of theMessage end tell </code></pre>  <p>It is working for the name but I do not get the sender or receipient. Any ideas?</p>
