<p>Here's what I'm trying to accomplish:</p>  <p><strong>Item 1. Drop folder that contains multiple image sequences onto applet</strong>.</p>  <pre><code>firstImageSeq0001.png firstImageSeq0002.png firstImageSeq0003.png secondImageSeq0001.png secondImageSeq0002.png secondImageSeq0003.png thirdImageSeq0001.png thirdImageSeq0002.png thirdImageSeq0001.png </code></pre>  <p><strong>Item 2. Get each group of sequences in the folder and make into a quicktime mov</strong></p>  <p>The script I have currently allows me to drop a the folder on the applet and then creates a movie with the first set of images. How do I get it to continue to the next set of images?</p>  <pre><code>on open collection      tell application "Finder" to set theSequence to first item of folder collection as alias      tell application "QuickTime Player 7"         activate         open image sequence theSequence frames per second 30          set nameSequence to (theSequence as string) &amp; ".mov"          tell document 1             with timeout of 500 seconds                 save self contained in nameSequence             end timeout          end tell     end tell  end open </code></pre>
