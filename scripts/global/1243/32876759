<p>I'm after a lightweight automator process (applescript) to detect filenames like "file_v01", "document_v03" all ending in "_vXX" to be incremented (to "file_v02" and there is suprisingly little content out there on this.</p>  <p>I have attempted simply detecting and removing the last two characters from the filename to no avail, and any thoughts would be great. Doesnt need to be anything fancy, just _v02 becomes _v03.</p>  <p>Any help would be great!!</p>
