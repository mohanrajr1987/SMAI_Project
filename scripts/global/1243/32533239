<pre><code>   script AppDelegate            property theWindow : missing value         property displayLabel : missing value              on applicationWillFinishLaunching:aNotification                      display dialog "Are you ready?" buttons {"Yes", "No"} default button "Yes"              end applicationWillFinishLaunching:              if result = {button returned:"No"} then                  display alert "That's a shame."                  tell application "This Application"                     quit                 end tell              else if result = {button returned:"Yes"} then                  set testVariable to "this is a test"              end if      end script </code></pre>  <p>So, this is an example of an app I'm working on in AppleScriptObjC.  I've taken a lot out and replaced things with different strings, but this is the basic layout.</p>  <p>How can I get the value of 'testVariable' into the 'displayLabel' property, which is linked to a label in the interface builder?  The label is empty initially, but I want the value of 'testVariable' to populate it once the script has been run.</p>  <p>Thanks!!!</p>
