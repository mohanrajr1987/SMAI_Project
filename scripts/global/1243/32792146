<p>I'll be distributing a folder that contains a bash script to multiple people. I'd like for this script to be an app that people can simply launch. For this reason and for the ability to create dialog boxes I'd like to call the bash script from applescript. </p>  <p>The problem I'm running in to is that I cannot figure out how to call the bash script because I'm not sure how to define the parent folder since it moves and can be placed anywhere. </p>  <p>I'm familiar with "path to me" in applescript but I just can't get it working. </p>  <p>Any help is greatly appreciated. </p>  <p><code>-- applescript to call bash script tell application "Finder"     set scriptParent to POSIX path of container of (path to me) as string     display dialog scriptParent end tell tell application "Terminal"     activate     do script "sudo bash " &amp; scriptParent &amp; "requirementSetup.sh" end tell</code></p>
