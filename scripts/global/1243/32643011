<p>I would like to be able to get a list of all the hyperlinked URLs in any formatted text that I select on the Mac (formatted text such as a web page or a word processor document).</p>  <p>Preferably I'd like use Applescript or Automator to extract this list of hyperlinks from the text (so that I can then use Applescript to perform further processing on these URLs).</p>  <p>Note that I am talking about <em>hyperlinks</em> being extracted from formatted text, not just extracting URLs from text containing plaintext URLs.</p>  <p>This hyperlink extraction from formatted text seems like it should be a simple programming task, but I have been struggling to find a way to do this in either Applescript or Automator. </p>  <p>Automator can be set to accept rich text input from a text selection, or can input rich text from the clipboard, but I cannot find any way to access this rich text as a string within Automator or Applescript, such that I can then extract the hyperlinked URLs from the string of rich text data.</p>  <p>Once I get access to the rich text data as a string, there will be no problem in extracting the URLs.</p>  <p>Any suggestions on how I might solve this issue are gratefully received. </p>
