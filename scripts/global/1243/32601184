<p>I am trying to write an <code>Apple Script</code> for <strong>Sketch.app</strong> <code>(com.bohemiancoding.sketch3)</code>. What i want to do is, create some image file that can be rendered in browser from Sketch document.</p>  <p>And when i open <strong>Sketch.app</strong> dictionary in <code>Script Editior</code> i see</p>  <pre><code>saveable file format enum     Sketch : The native Sketch 2 file format     PDF : Portable Document Format     TIFF : Tagged Image File Format </code></pre>  <p>So i thought about generating <code>TIFF</code> using following script, but it did not work</p>  <pre><code>tell application "Sketch"   set curdoc to document 0       save curdoc in "/Users/mirza/Downloads/mew2" as TIFF end tell </code></pre>  <p>I can create sketch copies in <code>.sketch</code> format with save command but not PDF or TIFF. Does sketch supports PDF and TIFF using apple script?</p>  <p>Or is there any other way around for that.</p>  <p><strong>Update</strong></p>  <p>I change the path to apple script format and set document index to 1. Now script looks like this</p>  <pre><code>set thisFilePath to (POSIX file "/Users/mirza/Downloads/mew2") log thisFilePath tell application "Sketch"     curdoc to document 1     save curdoc in thisFilePath as TIFF -- Tried with quotes as well, gives same error end tell </code></pre>  <p>But when i run the script i got the following error</p>  <pre><code>Result: error "Sketch got an error: Can’t continue curdoc." number -1708 </code></pre>  <p><strong>Update 2</strong></p>  <p>Fixed typo</p>  <pre><code>set thisFilePath to (POSIX file "/Users/mirza/Downloads/mew2") log thisFilePath tell application "Sketch"     set curdoc to document 1     log (path of curdoc)     save curdoc in thisFilePath as "TIFF" end tell </code></pre>  <p>But when i run the script i got the following error</p>  <pre><code>Result: error "Sketch got an error: The document cannot be exported to the \"TIFF\" format." number -50 </code></pre>
