<p>I have perhaps 1% <code>Objective C</code> knowledge, and am more comfortable using <code>AppleScript</code> for small tasks.</p>  <p>I'm developing an app that requires a more attractive alert window though, so I have started to learn more about <code>AppleScriptObjC</code>.</p>  <p><strong>My question is</strong>, how do I get my AppleScript variable '<em>serialNumber</em>', which is set to a string from the clipboard that will be something like "* 1234567890 *", into the Objective C side of things so that I can display the string through the label object?</p>  <p>I've already got my label set up as </p>  <p>'<em>property serialNumberLabel: missing value</em>' </p>  <p>I just don't know how to transfer the variable between the two languages, so that I can set the serialNumberLabel value to the string currently stored in the serialNumber variable.</p>  <p>Thanks!!!</p>
