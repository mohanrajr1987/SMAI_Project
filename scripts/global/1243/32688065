<p>I've a AppleScript that opens a <strong>Pages</strong> document.</p>  <pre><code>tell application "Pages"             activate             with transaction                 try (* This try block is to handle errors, occuring during the export process*)                     set dstfile to (parentpath &amp; aFile)(*Path to the file*)                     open (parentpath &amp; aFile)                  on error errorMessage number errorNumber                     display dialog "Failed to open. Reason: " &amp; errorMessage                 end try             end transaction         end tell </code></pre>  <p>But for some of documents, it throws an error saying the document can't be opened. <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/VvasG.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/VvasG.png" alt="Document open error"></a></p>  <p>The reason is that the document was of different format, which was later renamed as a ".pages" document.</p>  <p>I'm trying to write a code to ignore such documents, so that such alerts won't be shown. Also I would like to know how to disable such alerts from showing.</p>
