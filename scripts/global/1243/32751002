<p>I am having trouble with what I think is a pretty straightforward task, but cannot seem to get my script to work correctly. I have found a lot of help through the forums with regards to the individual routines used, but it still seems to fail.</p>  <p>In short, what I would like to do is monitor a folder for new files being added. Once a batch of files are added (every other day or so), it will create a folder in another directory with the new folder name being the current date, move those files to the new directory, and then execute a simple bash script which uses the new directory name as an argument.</p>  <p>My script compiles ok, but once files are added it only creates the new folder and nothing else. I appreciate any help. </p>  <pre><code>property the_sep : "-"  on adding folder items to my_folder after receiving the_files  tell application "Finder"     (* First create a new folder with name of folder = current date *)     set the_path to (folder "qa" of folder "Documents" of folder "ehmlab" of folder "Users" of disk "Macintosh HD")     set the_name to (item 1 of my myDate())     set the_name to (the_name &amp; the_sep &amp; item 2 of my myDate())     set the_name to (the_name &amp; the_sep &amp; item 3 of my myDate())     make folder at the_path with properties {name:the_name}     set newDir to the_path &amp; the_name end tell  (* Next, move the newly added files to the source into the newly created date folder *) repeat with i from 1 to number of items in the_files     tell application "Finder"         try             set this_file to (item i of the_files)             move file this_file to folder newDir         end try     end tell end repeat  do shell script "qc.sh " &amp; newDir  end adding folder items to  on myDate() set myYear to "" &amp; year of (current date) set myMth to text -2 thru -1 of ("0" &amp; (month of (current date)) * 1) set myDay to text -2 thru -1 of ("0" &amp; day of (current date)) return {myYear, myMth, myDay} end myDate </code></pre>
