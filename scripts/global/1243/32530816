<p>On Mac OS 10.10, I'm trying to create an alias of a mounted volume and put the alias in the user's home folder so this can later be put into the dock. The volume is an SMB share called satffdata$ (it's a hidden Windows share, hence the $ at the end). I've tried different variants of the paths, such as explicitly defining it and using the built in alias's but to no avail.</p>  <p>Please see code below and then output. The error code I'm getting and what I've read suggest that the problem could be it's seeing the paths as strings, however I can't explicitly define the startup disk name or the user profile as these may be different at the time the script is automatically run by our Casper Suite system.</p>  <pre><code>tell application "Finder"     activate      try         display dialog "Setting your StaffData$ (P Drive) Shortcut. Press OK to continue."         mount volume "smb://servername/staffdata$"         set staffData to POSIX path of "/Volumes/staffdata$"         set homeDir to POSIX path of (path to home folder)         display dialog staffData         display dialog homeDir         make new alias to staffData at homeDir         set name of result to "staffdata$"      end try end tell </code></pre>  <p>Output is as follows:</p>  <pre><code>tell application "Finder"     activate     display dialog "Setting your StaffData$ (P Drive) Shortcut. Press OK to continue."         --&gt; {button returned:"OK"}     mount volume "smb://servername/staffdata$"         --&gt; error number -10004 end tell tell application "Script Editor"     mount volume "smb://servername/staffdata$"         --&gt; file "staffdata$:" end tell tell application "Finder"     display dialog "/Volumes/staffdata$"         --&gt; {button returned:"OK"}     display dialog "/"         --&gt; {button returned:"OK"}     make new alias to "/Volumes/staffdata$" at "/"         --&gt; error number -10000 end tell </code></pre>  <p>If you've got any questions, I'll respond as soon as I can. Thanks!</p>
