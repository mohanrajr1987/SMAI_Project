<p>I have an appleScript code that controls the play/pause of Spotify on the mac and I have a iOS app (c-programming). Can I send data from the iOS app to my script that receives this data and make an action? I am trying a lot of things but nothing seems to work. Give me some ideas please...</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
