<p>So I'm working on a script that will be launched on a site, the site contains a chatbox with an option to like each message sent.</p>  <p>The tool/script that I create, should click on the like button for every message posted. (Probably a loop to like that element if it finds a new one? Not sure on this and could use some guidance)</p>  <p>I was wondering if I should use javascript to make it or applescript (I use a mac) and what resources would help me out with either and if there is another language I could do it in, I'm fairly new to automation and have experience with C, C#, Java and Php. (No, I don't know how to use cURL, unfortunately.)</p>  <p>Any insight or guidance would be much appreciated!</p>
