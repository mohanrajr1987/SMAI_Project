<p>I'm sure it is a question with an easy answer, but I've been trying to get something done for the last 4 hours now and I'm stuck at the very beginning.</p>  <p><strong>What I'm looking for</strong> I have 1500 word documents all in 1 map. I want this: 1. Select Finder 2. Open one word document that is CURRENTLY SELECTED (not based on name but on selection) 3. Select all content with "CMD + A" 4. Close the Word document 4. Open Excel 5. Perform a keystroke "ALT + CMD + P" to perform a certain macro 6. Go back to Finder 7. Go ONE document down with the keystroke "down" so it will select the next word document</p>  <p>And I want to repeat this action about 50 times so I can control if it goes well.</p>  <p>Now I have never worked with Apple Script before (and I'm bad at programmin in general).</p>  <p>Can anyone help me? Would be awesome! Thank you for your time.</p>
