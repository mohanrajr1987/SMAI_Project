<p>I am trying to create a script for importing directories as albums in Yosemite's Photos.</p>  <pre><code>activate application "SystemUIServer" tell application "Finder"     activate     repeat with flder in (get selection as alias list)         set albumName to name of flder         tell application "Photos"             make new album named albumName              set imageList to {}             repeat with i from 1 to number of items in flder                 set this_item to item i of flder as alias                 set the end of imageList to this_item             end repeat              import imageList into album albumName         end tell     end repeat end tell </code></pre>  <p>According to what I've found, this should work – it doesn't:</p>  <pre><code>error "Photos got an error:       Can’t make alias \"Macintosh HD:Users:knyttl:Pictures:archive:2014:01_prom:\" into type specifier." number -1700       from alias "Macintosh HD:Users:knyttl:Pictures:archive:2014:01_prom:" to specifier </code></pre>  <p>It compains on <code>number</code> in the <code>repeat</code> section. I am not even sure whether the syntax is correct – on some places I saw <code>number</code> on some other <code>count</code>, on some other places the iteration over files was done in completely different manner. I will be happy for any help.</p>
