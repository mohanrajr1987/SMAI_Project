<p>I am bumping up against what is probably an easy-fix problem as a relative Applescript noob. I have three lists of data which I want to re-organise. The first of the original lists contains ID numbers, the second names and the third a status. Example:</p>  <pre><code>set listNumbers to {} set listNumbers to {} &amp; {4456, 3232, 6545, 789} set listStatuses to {} set listStatuses to {} &amp; {"Eaten", "Beheaded", "Shot", "Lost"} set listNames to {} set listNames to {} &amp; {"Jim", "Joe", "Steve", "Mike"} </code></pre>  <p>I want to automatically extract / create x number of new lists, each with three items and following the pattern of item 1 from each list, item 2 from each list, etc. So I would get something like list1 = {4456, "Eaten", "Jim"}, list2 = {3232, "Beheaded", "Joe"}, etc. The original lists will actually be much longer, with several hundred items, and will be generated dynamically so I don't want to have manually code for every list.</p>  <p>I'm struggling to find useful examples to apply to this, but it seems like it should be straightforward! Any help much appreciated.</p>
