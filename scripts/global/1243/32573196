<p>I am trying to write an applescript application that logs into a website upon launching. So far I can successfully open Chrome, load the web page into the active tab, select and input the password, but I cannot click the submit button.</p>  <p>Below is the element on the page:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;button type="submit" class="btn  btn--ac" alt="Login"     title="Login" tabindex="6"&gt;&lt;i aria-hidden="true"     class="lush  lush-locked"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Login&lt;/button&gt; </code></pre>  <p>My skill level in javascript is little to none, yet I cannot find a way to successfully select this item and click it. I have tried already using the TagName and ClassName but it does not work, perhaps my syntax is incorrect. Is there a way to do this without a ID type?</p>  <p>I have tried:</p>  <pre><code>execute front window's active tab javascript  "document.getElementByClassName('btn, btn--ac').click()"  execute front window's active tab javascript  "document.getElementByTagName('button').click()" </code></pre>  <p>I should note this script runs in Google Chrome.</p>  <p>Thanks for any help in advance.</p>
