<p>Hi I am using osascript <code>tell process "Terminal"</code> in a bash script.</p>  <p>It obviously need permission for doing this. It asks me for sudo, but I would like to signe go give this script access to run without interacting. Can you do that?</p>  <p>Full osascript  call<br></p>  <pre><code>osascript &lt;&lt;END tell application "Terminal"     activate     tell application "System Events"         tell process "Terminal"             click menu item "Merge All Windows" of menu "Window" of menu bar 1         end tell     end tell end tell END </code></pre>  <p>Note: this is within a shell script.</p>
