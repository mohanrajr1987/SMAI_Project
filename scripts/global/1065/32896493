<p>I want to create an android app where I will have an avatar (happy to reuse an existing one) that will talk (animation with face expressions) based on the audio speech I will give it as input. Needs to look nice, nothing fancy. </p>  <p>I couldn't find any packages/SDK's that I can just reuse and integrate with my app.</p>  <p>Is there anything simple I can reuse? I really prefer not to create my own graphic and implement animation. </p>  <p>Thanks for the help!</p>
