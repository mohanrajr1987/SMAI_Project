<p>I am referring a library <a href="https://github.com/oguzbilgener/CircularFloatingActionMenu" rel="nofollow">Circular Floating Action Menu</a> which is fine for limited menu options like 4 or 5 menu items. I have a requirement where menu options can be any number. so I want to place a scroll view which will contain all menu options but the problem is that scroll view is appearing on top of the activity. Please help to put the scrollview to this library so that It can have n number of items.</p>  <p>Thanks for your help in advance.</p>  <p>Picture shows the floating menu option with limited menu items.   </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5Iqob.gif" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5Iqob.gif" alt="Limited menu options picture"></a></p>
