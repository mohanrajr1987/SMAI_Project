<p>I'm trying to figure out how to make my javascript find every img tag on a page and then animate it to make it continuously spin? So far I've only created a variable to find every img tag:</p>  <pre><code>var DI= document.getElementsByTagName("img"); </code></pre>  <p>Any help would be appreciated!</p>  <p><strong>edit</strong>: Just to clarify, this is for a chrome extension I'm making, so it would have to inject itself into preexisting websites.</p>  <p><strong>edit 2</strong>: Ok, so I understand CSS animations would be the easiest way to do this. But, how do I make the connection between finding all the image tags on a web page via Javascript to the actual CSS animation itself (so that it will find all images then make aforementioned images spin)?</p>
