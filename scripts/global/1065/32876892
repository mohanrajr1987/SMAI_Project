<p>Is it possible to animate RecyclerView height, or otherwise change it programmatically? For example, if I have a large header view that is sometimes visible, and other times not - I would want to animate the RecyclerView height to fill the screen when the header is animated out. </p>  <p>Changing LayoutParams.height does not seem to work. LinearLayout animateLayoutChanges causes a crash. </p>  <pre><code>&lt;LinearLayout&gt;    &lt;RelativeLayout (header)&gt;    &lt;RecyclerView&gt; &lt;/LinearLayout&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I want to make the RelativeLayout animate out the top (translationY) and then at the same time make the recyclerview animate to be taller to fit.</p>
