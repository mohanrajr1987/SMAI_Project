<p>I prepared some PowerPoint presentation and would like to present it in a different way. I have an idea of using special software bot with animations which will read slides. It can be something like Talking  Tom or even something more simple.</p>  <p>Please can you help me - is it possible? Can you share soft name/web links?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
