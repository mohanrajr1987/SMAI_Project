<p>I am working on animating a fractal (Triangle fractal) frame-by-frame. I know I need to use a call-back method to do this, but I am not sure how to implement it. I wish to get it working via a left-mouse click so I have this code:</p>  <pre><code>void mouse(int button, int state, int x, int y){   if(button == GLUT_RIGHT_BUTTON &amp;&amp; state == GLUT_DOWN){      glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);     divide_triangle(v[0], v[1], v[2], n);   }   //Closes the window on right button   if(button == GLUT_RIGHT_BUTTON &amp;&amp; state == GLUT_DOWN){   exit(0);   } } </code></pre>  <p>This is my mouse click call back, but this doesn't re-animate the triangle each time the triangle is drawn. How can show the process of the drawing each time I recurse through the triangle drawing?</p>  <pre><code>void divide_triangle(point2 a, point2 b, point2 c, int m) {   /* triangle subdivision using vertex coordinates */   point2 v0, v1, v2;   int j;   if(m&gt;0){     for(j=0; j&lt;2; j++) v0[j]=(a[j]+b[j])/2;     for(j=0; j&lt;2; j++) v1[j]=(a[j]+c[j])/2;     for(j=0; j&lt;2; j++) v2[j]=(b[j]+c[j])/2;     divide_triangle(a, v0, v1, m-1);     divide_triangle(c, v1, v2, m-1);     divide_triangle(b, v2, v0, m-1);   }   else(triangle(a,b,c));   glutPostRedisplay(); /* draw triangle at end of recursion */ } </code></pre>  <p>I want to redisplay once I draw the new triangle here, and make it appear to be an animation, so I guess I would need a delay between the redisplays. How can I set that up? But I also want to make it where I can draw this without animating everytime, I.e. I click a specific mouse key: say 'F1' or some unreserved key and it would just display the final recursive triangle. </p>  <p><a href="https://gist.github.com/TrivialPants/88969b6b14fa4ff2b5ec" rel="nofollow">Here is my full code for your viewing</a>.</p>  <p>Thank you everyone!</p>
