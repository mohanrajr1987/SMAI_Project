<p>In Android Studio 1.4 using the Nexus5 emulator, every time there is a 3D animation (x, y, rotationX, rotationY, rotationZ) using <a href="http://greensock.com/gsap" rel="nofollow">GSAP</a> in the webview, the logcat spits out a ton of this message:</p>  <pre><code>Attempt to remove non-JNI local reference, dumping thread </code></pre>  <p>This doesn't appear to affect my webapp's behavior other than a bit of stuttering when the message is produced, which is multiple times a second for animations that take a few seconds to complete.</p>  <p>Any ideas on how to stop, or is this even a problem?</p>  <p>UPDATE: The error does not occur on my test device, Samsung Galaxy S4. So it is likely only an emulator problem. </p>
