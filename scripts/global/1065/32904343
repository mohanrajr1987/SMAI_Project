<p>Check out this simple <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/VpDUG/4952/" rel="nofollow">JSFiddle</a> (ignore all the javascript code, this question here is only about the animated loading GIF).</p>  <p>I want to show the animated loading GIF before a form gets submitted.</p>  <p>I tried this:</p>  <pre><code>setTimeout(function(){  $('form[name="checkout-form"]').submit(); },1000); </code></pre>  <p>And this works fine, the animated loading GIF appears for 1 second, however, it stops the animation as soon as the submit request has been sent.</p>  <p>What do I have to do in order to let the GIF animated until the page loads again (or until the response comes back from the page?)</p>
