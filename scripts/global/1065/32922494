<p>I have an issue with an animated baloon. I would like to have the whole baloon clickable as the mouse pointer is over the baloon. Currently only the bottom portion of the ballon is clickable and turn into a pointer cursor as the mouse is hovering over the ballon. Could anybody see what I am doing wrong in the code below?</p>  <p>Baloon on the index page:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;a href="contactus.html"&gt;&lt;div style="cursor: pointer;" class="baloon"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; </code></pre>  <p>CSS file:</p>  <pre><code>.baloon {   width:375px;   height:490px;   background:url('../images/balloon.png');   background-repeat: no-repeat;   margin-left: 435px;   position: absolute;   top: 180px;   z-index: 90; } </code></pre>  <p>The baloon is animated with jQuery up and down. (can post more of the animation code is required)</p>
