<p>Is it possible to do a javascript animation ontop of a image? IF so, how?</p>  <p>This is my image, I want to add multiple stickmen walking around the departments in the map. I tried using CSS and javascript but failed, I was not able to add the stickmen ontop of the picture.</p>  <p>The approach I tried was creating div elements with stickmen pictures inside of them in IMG tags. Then tried using javascript to animate the specific divs. It did not work.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/egt7S.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/egt7S.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
