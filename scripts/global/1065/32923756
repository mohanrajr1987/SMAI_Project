<p>For a project a site is needed where when first loaded an animation appears that fades away and reveals the content of the site. I am fine with creating the animation and all. What I am not sure about is where to place it.</p>  <p>From a site ia point of view I see it like this. Either have the animation on the index page and once done remove that element with js or $ and reveal the index page. This means a reload will always show the animation again. This also means a click on the main logo that leads to the index page will also play the animation again. Something not really wanted or needed.</p>  <p>The only other option I see is having the animation on the index page and once done redirect to the home page where the site content is located. Like this a click on the logo can be set to either the home page or the index page. The info on the home page is also visible without watching the animation again since the home page has a separate nav link in the menu. Only if desired can the animation be watched again by clicking on the main logo.</p>  <p>From my perspective it will be the later. Though I ask you is this good practise? Is it OK to just have an animation on the index page and everything else on the home page?</p>  <p>I was thinking to either post this in <a href="https://ux.stackexchange.com/">https://ux.stackexchange.com/</a> or <a href="https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/">https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/</a> but I think this more concerns code architecture rather than design or ux because as mentioned the animation could also be loaded dynamically on the index page and once gone the content is shown on the index page. So you see I am not asking for opinion but rather for the right logic to tackle this task.</p>  <p>What method is best applied for this scenario? Would you consider having the animation on the index page and then redirect to the home page?</p>  <pre><code>Linked https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22090313/show-an-animation-before-show-my-index-html https://stackoverflow.com/questions/503093/how-can-i-make-a-redirect-page-using-jquery http://www.submittoday.com/splash_pages_and_search_engine_optimization.html http://stackoverflow.com/a/22090389/1010918 https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30573395/page-loading-animation-method https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1964839/jquery-please-wait-loading-animation </code></pre>
