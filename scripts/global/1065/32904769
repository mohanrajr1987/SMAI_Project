<p>There <em>RecyclerList</em> (as tested and <em>ListView</em>) it points <strong>ItemList</strong>(<em>RelativeLayout</em>). Inside <strong>ItemList</strong> contained <strong>frontView</strong>(<em>RelativeLayout</em>).</p>  <p>In <strong>frontView</strong> there is an icon that you can click on.  When you run <em>AnimatorSet</em>, that's how it looks:</p>  <pre><code>moveUpAnimatorSet = new AnimatorSet(); moveUpAnimatorSet.playTogether(     ObjectAnimator.ofFloat(nameT, "translationY", transY),     ObjectAnimator.ofFloat(descT, "translationY", transY));  moveUpAnimatorSet.setDuration(250); moveUpAnimatorSet.setInterpolator(new AccelerateDecelerateInterpolator()); moveUpAnimatorSet.addListener(animationTopChangeListener); moveUpAnimatorSet.start(); </code></pre>  <p>After this animation is a call sheet, and updates run reverse animation, like this:</p>  <pre><code>moveDownAnimatorSet = new AnimatorSet(); moveDownAnimatorSet.playTogether(         ObjectAnimator.ofFloat(nameT, "translationY", 0),         ObjectAnimator.ofFloat(descT, "translationY", 0));  moveDownAnimatorSet.setDuration(250); moveDownAnimatorSet.setInterpolator(new AccelerateDecelerateInterpolator()); moveDownAnimatorSet.addListener(animationBottomChangeListener); moveDownAnimatorSet.start();  dispatchTapIconUpdate(); //it's adapter.notifyDataSetChanged(); </code></pre>  <p>The problem is that often there is a bug that looks like this:</p>  <p><strong>1)</strong> we tap on the icon and it went upstairs; </p>  <p><strong>2)</strong> hereinafter called <strong>notifyDataSetChanged()</strong>;</p>  <p>And in the next step may occur two options:</p>  <p><strong>3.1)</strong> all is well and that the icon will return to animation down;</p>  <p><strong>3.2)</strong> that animated icon, no animation will be back down. And ItemList, which is above or below the icon unexpected bounce up and go down with the animation!</p>  <p>The bug manifests when before you tap the icon, scroll through the list.</p>  <p><em>Trace and breakpoints failed.</em> According to him, everything happens at one point on which clicked.</p>  <p>Help me please!</p>
