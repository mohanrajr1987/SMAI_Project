<p>In Glassfish Admin GUI -> Configurations -> server-config -> Virtual Servers -> server, I can add key/value entries to "Additional Properties".</p>  <p>How can I access them from within my web app?</p>  <p>They seem neither to be in System.getProperties() nor in InitialContext.lookup() with "mykey" or "java:comp/env/mykey".</p>  <p>I'd like to access them as JNDI java:comp/env/... variable, is that possible?</p>
