<p>I am trying to use the automatic wsimport feature for GlassFish Web Services, but it is not working.</p>  <p>The Web Service works, I am able to test it though SoapUI and it responds properly. However using the <code>?Tester</code> URL it loads up an error that wsimport failed. Looking into the logs I can see these messages;</p>  <pre><code>[2015-10-01T11:10:27.785+0100] [glassfish 4.1] [INFO] [AS-WSJSR109IMPL-00111] [javax.enterprise.webservices] [tid: _ThreadID=31 _ThreadName=http-listener-1(2)] [timeMillis: 1443694227785] [levelValue: 800] [[Invoking wsimport with http://localhost:8080/Project/WebServiceImplService?WSDL]] [2015-10-01T11:10:27.863+0100] [glassfish 4.1] [INFO] [] [] [tid: _ThreadID=31 _ThreadName=Thread-8] [timeMillis: 1443694227863] [levelValue: 800] [[parsing WSDL...]] [2015-10-01T11:10:28.799+0100] [glassfish 4.1] [INFO] [] [] [tid: _ThreadID=31 _ThreadName=Thread-8] [timeMillis: 1443694228799] [levelValue: 800] [[Generating code...]] [2015-10-01T11:10:29.078+0100] [glassfish 4.1] [INFO] [] [] [tid: _ThreadID=31 _ThreadName=Thread-8] [timeMillis: 1443694229078] [levelValue: 800] [[Compiling code...]] [2015-10-01T11:10:29.152+0100] [glassfish 4.1] [INFO] [] [] [tid: _ThreadID=31 _ThreadName=Thread-8] [timeMillis: 1443694229152] [levelValue: 800] [[[ERROR] com.sun.tools.javac.Main is not available in the classpath, requires Suns JDK version 5.0 or latter.]] [2015-10-01T11:10:29.153+0100] [glassfish 4.1] [INFO] [] [] [tid: _ThreadID=31 _ThreadName=Thread-8] [timeMillis: 1443694229153] [levelValue: 800] [[compilation failed, errors should have been reported]] [2015-10-01T11:10:29.153+0100] [glassfish 4.1] [SEVERE] [AS-WSJSR109IMPL-00113] [javax.enterprise.webservices] [tid: _ThreadID=31 _ThreadName=http-listener-1(2)] [timeMillis: 1443694229153] [levelValue: 1000] [[wsimport failed]] </code></pre>  <p>I have googled the issue and found that it is related to <code>tools.jar</code> not being included into the class path of the war package. </p>  <p>Using eclipse I have included a <code>tools.jar</code> file as an external library from my <code>jdk1.8.0_31\lib</code> folder and there is no apparent change. The error is still present. What am I missing here? What else can i try?</p>  <p>Additionally, when using GlassFish through Eclipse <code>?Tester</code> works as expected. This error only occurs when I move the project onto another server.</p>  <p>EDIT: Looking at the markers in eclipse it appears <code>tools.jar</code> was never included because eclipse tells me it may result in <code>ClassNotFoundExceptions</code> exceptions. Can I tell Eclipse to ignore the warning and do it anyway? Is that wise? How else can I get <code>tools.jar</code> into my classpath?</p>
