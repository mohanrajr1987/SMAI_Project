<p>I am using Java Web Start Application with sun-glassfish 3.1 and Java7 and self signed certificate. I upgraded chrome browser to version 45 and started getting ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID errors. </p>  <p>Before upgrade I had "Not Trusted...proceed?" click-through once and it was not asked later. Now I get ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID error again and again. Strange thing is sometimes it is working and I don't get any. </p>  <p>I thought it might be related with Glassfish because it mostly occurs when load is high. I have seen some bug reports similar to my case but could not be sure if I'm having the same problem. I'm a novice at this area so please forgive any mistakes. Should I wait for a fix in chrome or is there  anything I could do to understand and fix the error?</p>
