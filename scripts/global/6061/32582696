<p>I have a web application that originally was a JSF app, but has been migrated to pure HTML/JavaScript. We are now in the progress of eliminating JSF completely.</p>  <p>We had the physical file main.xhtml, which was requested by "main.jsf", where the FacesServlet was declared in web.xml with url-mapping *.jsf.</p>  <p>We have moved the content to main.html, and put a meta-tag REFRESH in main.xhtml to redirect to main.html.</p>  <p>Now the problem is that even if I remove FacesServlet from web.xml, it still redirects the request for main.jsf to main.xhtml. If I rename the file main.xhtml to main.jsf, requesting main.jsf gives a 404, and the server log says it cannot find a file "main.jsp".</p>  <p>Now the question is: If it redirects *.jsf to *.jsp or *.xhtml even when there is no FacesServlet in web.xml, what is responsible for this redirections?</p>  <p>I'm using GlassFish 3.1.2.2.</p>
