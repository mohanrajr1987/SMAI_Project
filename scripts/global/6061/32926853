<p>Some time ago, I upgraded my Windows 8.1 to Windows 10. <strong>After</strong> that I started using the Glassfish application server. Now, when I went to: <code>[AdminTool] -&gt; Server -&gt; General -&gt; JVM Report</code>, I saw:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Operating System Information:</p>      <p>Name of the Operating System: Windows 8.1</p> </blockquote>  <p>That seemed strange, so I checked my OS version with <code>ver</code> command, and it's obviously like 10.0.*</p>  <p>I am curious by nature, and I can't seem to explain it. I believe this report is generated every time the JVM starts, and therefore it's not a remainder from the previous OS version.</p>  <p>Could someone elaborate?</p>
