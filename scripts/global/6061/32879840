<p>I have a <code>Lucene</code> search implemented on multiple tables and multiple fields over Hibernate. The following works:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Search query: "ABCDEFGH"</p>      <p>Table1.Column1: "IJKL"</p>      <p>Table2.Column3: "MNOP"</p>      <p>Table3.Column2: "ABCDEFGH"</p> </blockquote>  <p>The result of the lucene search will result in giving me the Table3.Column2.</p>  <p>Now my database has some Foreign Keys, and I want to do a search over those Foreign Keys. </p>  <p><em>Table 3 has a FK to Table 2</em></p>  <p><em>Table 2 has a FK to Table 1</em></p>  <blockquote>   <p>Search query: "ABCDEFGH"</p>      <p>Table1.Column1: "ABCD"</p>      <p>Table2.Column3: "EF"</p>      <p>Table3.Column2: "GH"</p> </blockquote>  <p>I want to get the row of Table 3 that has the FK's just right, so that <code>Table1.Column1 + Table2.Column3 + Table3.Column2 is "ABCDEFGH"</code>. I'm not able to find anything like this.</p>
