<p>I'd like to build Jave EE .war files with the current GIT revision in their names. I managed to setup org.codehaus.mojo/buildnumber-maven-plugin and use the following in my Maven pom.xml to generate proper target/*.war files:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;finalName&gt;${project.artifactId}-${project.version}-${buildNumber}&lt;/finalName&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Problem is: Netbeans 8.0.2 won't deploy the result in my local Glassfish 4.1, on "run" it just days:</p>  <pre><code>NetBeans: Deploying on GlassFish Server 4.1     profile mode: false     debug mode: false     force redeploy: true </code></pre>  <p>There is no error or warning nor anything in Glassfish's sever.log. The following line is missing in the Netbeans output though until I remove the ${buildNumber} again:</p>  <pre><code>In-place deployment at /home/chammers/workspace/foo/target/Foo </code></pre>  <p>I guess NetBeans does not read  but computes it itself and then does not find the proper directory in target/ and silently exists.</p>  <p>Any ideas?</p>
