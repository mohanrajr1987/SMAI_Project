<p>I'm new to JavaEE and GlassFish and all, but I was put on a team (at school) to update a glassfish based server we use to host programming competitions. I was given the eclipse project that worked last year, but many of the dependencies are missing (they had absolute paths set to the previous host's local drive) and I am out of contact with the person who hosted the server last year. I have most of the errors fixed and dependencies re-added but I am unable to launch due to one last error,</p>  <p>"Target runtime GlassFish 4.0 is not defined."</p>  <p>A number of google searches has gotten me almost nowhere and I cannot find anything about re-associating a glassfish project with the runtime.</p>  <p>Here are images of my current configuration (comment if you want to see more)</p>  <p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/MdeS0Uc.png" alt="GlassFish Tools Server Tab"> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/bEu8Fxx.png" alt="Package Explorer"> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/9OZKi7c.png" alt="Properties -&gt; Server"> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/wp1Gu6i.png" alt="Properties -&gt; Targeted Runtimes"> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/Y9fLJvW.png" alt="Properties -&gt; Project Facets"> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/ORvf3B3.png" alt="Properties -&gt; Project Build Path"> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/Ku2VVYE.png" alt="Error Message"></p>  <p><strong>So, the big question, how do I fix this and re-associate this project with the runtime?</strong></p>
