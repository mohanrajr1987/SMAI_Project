<p>I've created simple HelloWorld-like servlet (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0y-6On2qeg" rel="nofollow">just like this</a>), but I can't use it with GlassFish. There is always 404 error. Tried Tomcat and everything works fine.</p>  <p>In the Idea output there is message "Server is not connected. Deploy is not available.". But on localhost url I see message "Your server is now running".</p>  <p>So what is wrong with my glassfish server? What is the strange output?</p>
