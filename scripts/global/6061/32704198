<p>So I got ssl working with apache server, the certificate is installed and when I type my domain <a href="https://chatbuilding.co.uk" rel="nofollow">https://chatbuilding.co.uk</a> I get the ssl padlock. However my web applications connect to a glassfish server, which does not have a certificate yet.</p>  <p>Am I correct that when the page connects to the glassfish server, it checks it for its own certificate? For example, <a href="https://chatbuilding.co.uk:8181/FreeChat/ServletMain" rel="nofollow">https://chatbuilding.co.uk:8181/FreeChat/ServletMain</a> will be the glassfish server on port 8080 and 8181, so does this require the glassfish server to have own copy of the certificate?</p>  <p>I think I'm understanding this correctly? Not sure..</p>
