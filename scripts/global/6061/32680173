<p>I am a bit confused with Application Server and deploying my web application on it. Say I have my own server at workplace. I understand how a web server works, I could simply install WAMP or XAMP and start my own web server, SQL server as well.</p>  <p>How do I start an application server? Say I want to start a glassfish server. How do I deploy my application on this web server / application server? This confusion has been a nightmare for me. Please help me bring some clarity around this subject.  </p>
