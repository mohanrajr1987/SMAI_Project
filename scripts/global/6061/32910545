<p>I have an application(Application-1) running on Glassfish and using a non xa datasource. The DB is on SQL server which does not have xa enabled(it need not have to be). I have a different application(Application-2) that will need the SQL server to have the xa enabled. So if I enable the xa transactions for the SQL server and the machine, would there be any issues for Application-1 to access the DB? In short, can an application use a non xa datasource that will access a DB on an SQL server that is xa enabled?</p>
