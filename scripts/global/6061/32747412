<p>So I have been creating a web application, I use apache php server on port 80 and apache tomcat on port 8181. But anyway, the problem was for ages I couldn't get the certificate or ssl to work and I eventually tried disabling port 8080 and all other ports for http in the server file and the https started working. If I re-enable http again it stops working. Does anyone know why? I do not need anything on the server to be http anyway, but I am very interested why this is. I spent three days messing around with glassfish for two and then tomcat all day and finally found out why tomcat was not working? From the way it behaves, its like when http is not disabled there is no reply when trying to access a https port?</p>
