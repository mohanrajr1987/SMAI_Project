<p>is Soundcloud having some bugs? after taking some hours to develop the API so that users can copy paste the share URL of their song into the scrapper, now the info only shows an image and the text/title of song....a few months ago we tested and we could play the song directly from our test...also in facebook and linkedin also not possible to play any songs when copy pasting the URL...please when are you fixing this? thisis really very annoying and forcing us to find an alternative site like Pandora or spotify to enable users to paste music...thanks...</p>  <p>G</p>
