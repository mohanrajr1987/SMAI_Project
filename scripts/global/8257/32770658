<p>Guten Tag! The problem is: I have some code which prints some text messages via <code>Console</code> class on terminal (command line window). I need this info to be placed in two 'containers' - terminal and text file. Is there a way of adding output stream to <code>Console</code> class in order to make it output data not only on terminal? It'd be grate if I wont need to change existing code too much (there are a lot of places where <code>Console.Write()</code> and <code>Console.WriteLine()</code> are used).</p>
