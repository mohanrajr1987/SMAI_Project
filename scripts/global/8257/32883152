<p>I have a Java application and I have a user manual, that is available for the users, which is a ressource of my program.</p>  <p>My project is build with Maven, I have several project. In my GUI project I have the userManual.pdf in the following path : src\main\resources\userManual\userManual.pdf</p>  <p>Under Eclipse IDE, I run my main project and when I click on the user manual button the PDF file is going to be opened. But when I build my project I have an Internal Runtime Error in a option pane : An internal error occured (The file:.\userManual\userManual.pdf doesn't exist.). The application is most likely in an inappropriate state, thus will nox exit.</p>  <p>My code :</p>  <pre><code>File manual = new File(ManualBar.class.getClassLoader().getResource("./userManual/userManual.pdf").getPath());  try {    Desktop.getDesktop().open(manual); } catch (IOException e1) {    JOptionPane.showInputDialog(null,                                "The user manual is not available",                                 "User manual is missing",                                JOptionPane.INFORMATION_MESSAGE); } </code></pre>  <p>I think I don't call correctly my ressource or it's not to the correct place.</p>
