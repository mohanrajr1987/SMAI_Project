<p>I am writing a javafx application which actually reads a file from a clients machine and stream it to a nodejs api, I have completed this task using php and nodejs and it is working fine, no problems over there, I know how to read a file and and stream a file locally but I am really not sure, how to stream the contents of that file to a REST Api? your help is much much appreciated :(</p>
