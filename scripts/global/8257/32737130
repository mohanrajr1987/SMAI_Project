<p>I have a radio player app, which streams audio from online radio stations. I have background modes enabled, like so: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/6ugC9.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/6ugC9.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>When I built the app with Xcode 6, it worked on all devices and all iOS versions up to iOS 8. It even worked on an iPhone 6 that was later updated to iOS 9. Since then, I have updated to Xcode 7 and now when I build and run it on any device with any iOS version the background audio does not work, it just stops when the app goes to background. </p>  <p>Any ideas?</p>
