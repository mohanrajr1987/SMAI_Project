<p>I have video buffered from livestream.com on firefox, however broadcasting has ended few hours ago but I can still go to any time in video and play it back. I'm trying to find a way to save it but If i refresh the page or restart firefox it will be gone for good. Do you have any ideas how to get it? Where can it be cached, this video is 6 hours of full HD so file must be huge and my FF cache is relatively tiny, like few hundred mbs.</p>
