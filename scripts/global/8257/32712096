<p>I need to access a <strong>RTSP</strong> stream from a <strong>Samsung SNB-5000</strong> video camera. The  <strong>RTSP</strong> link has this pattern:</p>  <p><strong><em>rtsp://xx.xx.xx.x:yyy/onvif/profile/media.smp</em></strong>, yyy being the port.</p>  <p>I have tried:</p>  <p><strong>Ozeki SDK</strong>: The link requested is just rtsp://xx.xx.xx.x:yyy, my link format renders it unusable;</p>  <p><strong>VlcdotNet</strong>: It is great, hoewever, all tutorials refer to an old version and I could only find the new version of the library which has no tutorials;</p>  <p>Vlc C# plugin(<strong>AXVLC</strong>): deprecated;</p>  <p><strong>ispy SDK</strong>: could not find any tutorial;</p>  <p>The video format I can obtain is either <strong>H.264</strong> or <strong>MJPEG</strong>.  As you can see, I am not a PROgrammer, I am rather newb.</p>  <p>Help would be really appreciated. </p>  <p>BTW: I saw a similar question on StackOverflow, to which a foo bar guy replied something as: don't do it yourself if you are newb</p>
