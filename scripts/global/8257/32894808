<p>I use this code snippet to read text from a webpage aand save it to a string? </p>  <p>I would like the readline() function to start from the beggining. So it would read content of the webpage again. How Can I do that </p>  <pre><code>if (response == httpURLConnection.HTTP_OK) {                  in = httpURLConnection.getInputStream();                 isr = new InputStreamReader(in);                 br = new BufferedReader(isr);                  while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {                     fullText += line;                  }                  // I want to go through a webpage source again, but                 // I can't because br.readLine() = null. How can I                   put                  // put a marker on the beginning of the page?                  while ((line1 = br.readLine()) != null) {                     fullText1 += line1;                 // It will not go into this loop                 } </code></pre>
