<p>I'm building an application on Node.js meant to serve image compositions (overlays of multiple images served as one image).  The user can select up to ten images and combine them.  We want to serve a final composition of the selected images quickly and without saving it onto the server.  We think using streams is the best way to do this, because reading all the images would eat up our memory.  Is it possible to combine the image streams on the fly and serve the final composition?</p>  <p>For example, is this pipeline possible:</p>  <ul> <li>Create readable stream for the multiple individual images from the database into the server.</li> <li>Combine the image streams </li> <li>Pipe the composition to the user</li> </ul>
