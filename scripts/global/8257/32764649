<p>i'm using ffmpeg with ffserver to read a video stream, add a text overlay and re-stream the video in mpjpeg format. The text overlay is stored in a file, reloaded every frame with the drawtext ffmpeg filter and all is working properly.</p>  <p>Now I want to make more awesome the overlayed infos, I googled something like "ffmpeg drawtext rtf" and "ffmpeg drawtext html" but I dind't found any solution...</p>  <p>Is this possible?  Can I use any kind of Rich Text format file as an overlay in ffmpeg drawtext filter?</p>  <p>Thanks for reading (and maybe help me). R.</p>
