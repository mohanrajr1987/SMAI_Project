<p>I have about 30 IP cameras that will have to connect to a server. And i was just wondering how powerful does the server have to be to manage the 60mbit connection(2 mbit per camera) and to save all of that streaming stuff to a hard drive. Any kind of advice would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you</p>
