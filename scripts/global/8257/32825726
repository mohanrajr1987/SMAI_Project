<p>I'm trying to add ping results (<code>isAlive</code>) to the stream below so that later I can pipe to http response but I received the following error  </p>  <pre><code>events.js:85 throw er; // Unhandled 'error' event </code></pre>  <p>I don't understand what it means and would be grateful for any help afforded to me?</p>  <pre><code>var Readable = require('stream').Readable; var s = new Readable; var ping = require('ping');  var hosts = ['192.168.1.1', 'google.com', 'yahoo.com']; hosts.forEach(function(host){     ping.sys.probe(host, function(isAlive){         var msg = isAlive ? 'host ' + host + ' is alive' : 'host ' + host + ' is dead';         //console.log(msg);         s.push(msg)     }); }); //s.push(null) ; //s.pipe(process.stdout); </code></pre>
