<p>I already know the coding part of actionscript worker. Recently I switched my IDE to FlashDevelop. I can't figure out how to compile actionscript worker swf in FlashDevelop.</p>  <p>I try to use Tools - Flash Tools - Build current file. But it throws error saying  <code>Error: Type was not found or was not a compile-time constant: File.</code> Maybe it is because my project is a AIR project and I use AIR API in my worker. </p>  <p>I also try to compile worker swf using <code>amxmlc</code> via command line. It compiles successfully. But AIR Debug Launcher crashes when executing worker swf part. The swf which I compiled manually is nearly half size of the former one that Flash Builder generated for me. I guess I compiled a release version swf so that ADL can't debug and then crashed.</p>  <p>So how do I compile a worker swf in FlashDevelop to debug or to publish a release of project?</p>  <hr>  <p><strong>Update</strong>:</p>  <p>I find that the "Build current file" command in menu is a feature in FlashDevelop called quick build. By default, it will compile current file output to project root directory without arguments. We can add compiler arguments using <code>@mxmlc</code> ASDoc tag (see the links below for detail) to make it compile a worker swf for us. But currently in FD 5.0.1 it seems to be a bug that <code>@mxmlc +configname=air</code> doesn't compile air swfs. I find a workaround using <code>@mxmlc -noplay -library-path=[Flex_SDK]\frameworks\libs\air\airglobal.swc -library-path=[Flex_SDK]\frameworks\libs\air\airframework.swc</code>, but the path can't be surrounded with quote otherwise FD will show an error. I may look into the source and try to fix it.</p>  <p>links:</p>  <ul> <li><a href="http://www.flashdevelop.org/community/viewtopic.php?t=1070" rel="nofollow">AS3 Quick Build documentation</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.flashdevelop.org/wikidocs/index.php?title=QuickBuild" rel="nofollow">Quick Build</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.4inloop.de/blog/flashdevelop-compiling-multiple-swf-in-one-project/" rel="nofollow">FlashDevelop: Compiling Multiple SWF In One Project</a></li> </ul>
