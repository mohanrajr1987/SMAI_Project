<p>I'm looking for a api that allow me make changes in a video at runtime without reprocessing that everytime and generating a video output to see the results.</p>  <p>The kind of changes are like:</p>  <ul> <li>insert/remove images/texts</li> <li>apply effects in texts like colors, size, fonts.</li> <li>effects like rotate, fade, slide in texts and images</li> <li>cut and change positions of frame rates</li> <li>insert audio</li> </ul>  <p>Anyone know if actionScript flash api allow me to do something like that, and if yes, from where can I start?</p>
