<p>I would like my timeline to advance to a certain labeled frame after a sound completes.  Here is the code that I have so far:</p>  <pre><code>var n1Channel:SoundChannel = new narratorAlphabetSounds(); n1Channel.addEventListener(Event.SOUND_COMPLETE, audioComplete); function audioComplete(e:Event):void { gotoAndPlay("step2");   } </code></pre>  <p>The sound fails to load and errors occure when trying to test. Any suggestions? Thanks!</p>
