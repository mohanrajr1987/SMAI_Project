<p>Using Flash CC</p>  <p>I have the following array. The first key retrieves the string "Fish" from another array.</p>  <pre><code>static public var comboType_1:Array =  [Constants.level_Data_Edible[Constants.currentLevel],"Frog"]; </code></pre>  <p>When I try to iterate over this array with</p>  <pre><code>for(var i:String in hint)     trace(hint[i]); </code></pre>  <p>I get this result:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Fish,    Frog,    function Function() {}</p> </blockquote>  <p>I debug it, it shows the array length is 2.  I googled the function Function() {} and it produces zero hits on Google.</p>  <p>No one has ever heard of this function Function() {} error. </p>  <p>There is no third index, you can see in the array. This error prevents me from iterating over the array. #1065. Variable Function function () {} is not defined.</p>  <p>I'm pretty sure this is yet another Flash bug, but I just want to know the workaround.</p>
