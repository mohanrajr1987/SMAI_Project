<p>I'm trying to get the reply from the address specified in var url:String, which is either 0 or 1. If the reply is 1 then it must set currentState = CallFailed (as seen below). The client compiles without error (using Adobe Flash Builder 4.6) and seems to successfully reach var url:String, but doesn't seem to be getting the response\and or my if statement is incorrect.  </p>  <p><strong>Actionscript:</strong></p>  <pre><code>            // check to see if block.php replies 0 or 1              var url:String = "https://domain.com/block.php?postid=" + calleeInput.text + "";             var request:URLRequest = new URLRequest(url);             var variables:URLVariables = new URLVariables();             request.data = variables;             request.method = URLRequestMethod.POST;              navigateToURL(request);              if (request.data == 1)             {                 // if reply is 1 then cancel the call                currentState = CallFailed;             return;             } </code></pre>  <p><strong>PHP:</strong></p>  <p>PHP will echo 0 or 1 when block.php is loaded. It's not encoded in any format such as JSON\AJAX.</p>
