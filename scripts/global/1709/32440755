<p>I am trying to send a live stream from FMLE to a CDN, but passing through our FMS (installed locally); so the chain I have is:</p>  <p>FMLE => FMS => CDN</p>  <p>Now, publishing to the <strong>CDN is username/password protected</strong>. If I try to connect directly <strong>from FMLE to the CDN</strong>, FMLE opens a layer asking for credentials to "Connect to FMS" - I fill the form with username and password provided by the CDN, click on OK, and <strong>everithing works fine</strong>.</p>  <p><strong>The problem</strong> comes when <strong>introducing the FMS</strong>: I created a simple application in FMS to republish the stream (<em>simplified code below</em>), and it works fine for CDN that don't ask for username/password, but <strong>I'm not able to figure out how to send credentials</strong> from the FMS application to the CDN.</p>  <p>Here the code I'm using (it's simplified, I'm putting here only the core code):</p>  <pre><code>application.onPublish = function (oClient, oStream) {     application.nc = new NetConnection ();  // Creating new NetConnection     application.nc.connect (FMS_url);  // Connecting to CDN      application.ns = new NetStream (application.nc);  // Creating new NetStream     application.ns.setBufferTime (1);  // Setting buffer time     application.ns.attach (oStream);  // Attaching incoming streaming     application.ns.publish ("stream_name", "live");  // Publishing } </code></pre>  <p>More info:</p>  <ul> <li>We do need to pass through FMS, so "why don't you stream directly to the CDN ?" is not an option :-)</li> <li>FMS URL and credentials are correct, it's not any typing error :-(</li> <li>After application.nc.connect(), the onStatus event is fired with NetConnection.Connect.Success, but inmediately after that it is fired again with NetConnection.Connect.Closed (without any other info).</li> </ul>  <p>Following suggestions found on the web, I tryed things like</p>  <pre><code>application.nc.connect (FMS_url); </code></pre>  <p>or</p>  <pre><code>application.nc.connect (FMS_url + "?username&amp;password"); </code></pre>  <p>or adding </p>  <pre><code>application.nc.addHeader ("Credentials", false, { userid: "username", password: "password" }); </code></pre>  <p>... but nothing seems to work, the result is always the same.</p>  <p>Any suggestion ? :-) Thank you in advance, best regards</p>
