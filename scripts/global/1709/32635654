<p>I have ball converted to symbol (movie clip) with 2 frames (blue and red ball). I want when left arrow is pressed, frame inside ball change to frame 1 and if i press right arrow, frame inside ball change to 2. Ball symbol name is "ball". I am really new with flash and AS2, so sorry if i look like noob :)</p>  <p>Here is what i've tried:</p>  <pre><code>on(keyPress "37"){     ball.gotoAndStop(1); } on(keyPress "39"){     ball.gotoAndStop(2); } </code></pre>  <p>I placed it in actionscript panel of ball.</p>  <p>key for Left Arrow is 37 key for Right Arrow is 39</p>
