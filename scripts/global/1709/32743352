<p>So being new to AS3 but not development in general, during a recent project that I just started I hit an immediate snag where my normal method of OOD is causing errors in AS3.</p>  <p>I created a layer in Adobe Flash called code just to keep everything separate and in frame one under actions I used the following code to get started:</p>  <pre><code>var GameContainerSize:int = 400;  class GameInfo {     var GameID:int;     var HomeTeam:String;     var VisitingTeam:String;     function GameInfo()     {      } } </code></pre>  <p>This simple code immediately causes an error though</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Scene 1, Layer 'Code', Frame 1, Line 4    1131: Classes must not be nested.</p> </blockquote>  <p>And my best guess is this is because the timeline and all code on it exists within a class already. So what should I be doing if I want to develop this program using class objects, or is this even possible in flash?</p>
