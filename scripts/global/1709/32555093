<p>I do have a very specific project here with the following:</p>  <ul> <li><ol> <li>read an JSON file with a bunch of names and some relative data;</li> </ol></li> <li><ol start="2"> <li>create, dynamically, an animation with some pictures, including data from JSON to DynamicText;</li> </ol></li> <li><ol start="3"> <li>in this animation some elements will have transitions (tween);</li> </ol></li> <li><ol start="4"> <li>The code also have to call an External JavaScript that generate the sound of  text-to-speech of some JSON information (like: "Hello, Mike!");</li> </ol></li> <li><ol start="5"> <li>The total length of the originated mp4 file will be 90s at least.</li> </ol></li> <li><ol start="6"> <li>Since this code will run on everyday basis it must be capable to be called from a python or System Center;</li> </ol></li> </ul>  <p>Some portion of this (items 1 to 3) are done. But from item 4 to the end, including the automatically mp4 result file generation still are a big question mark ... How can I handle those?</p>  <p>Some help please ?</p>
