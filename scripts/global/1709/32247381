<p>I want to tween a curved arrow from one point to another in as3. I mean this line,with a  arrow head, gets drawn from one point to another. this is to show the movement of say a nerve impulse from brain to another body part. I have tried shape tween but its not clean. I have tried using mask ,that again is tedious. I know how to draw by curveTo method. Is there a way that it can be tweened.</p>
