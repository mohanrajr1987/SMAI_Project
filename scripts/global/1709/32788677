<p>I am having a lot of headache trying to make a game loop in Actionscript. Searched a lot and could not to find the answer. My idea is:</p>  <p>When de game starts, it defined the units sequence of attack, based in their speed (each player can have until 8 units, of any kind). I store this sequence into an Array. I did create the engine in Javascript returning the values in console.log... and works fine... but transporting it to AS3, the things aren't working as I thought.</p>  <p>So... I have the sequence... and now I do the loop This is my logic (not using any specific language):</p>  <pre><code>for (i = 0; i &lt; sequence.length; i++) {      isHitting = sequence[i]; // first unit from list is the hitter     isDefending = mostPowerfulEnemy(); // method to check who will be attacked      // here is the problem!!!!     isHitting.moveTo(isDefending); // method to move the MC near the target      var kills = isHitting.hit(isDefending); // calc the damage and return the kills      if (isDefending.amount &lt;= 0) {         // remove the MC from Stage and the sequence list        continue; //to move to the next hitter in sequence      } else {         isDefending.amount -= kills;        continue; //to move to the next hitter in sequence     } } </code></pre>  <p>The problem is: all units are moving at same time! I've learning about Events and the method addEventListener() sounds like the best option, but i have to call a function, right? I do it... so the unit move to the point... hit... and stop... I need a way to say: "hey, this unit already did his move, did stop and did hit the target, you can now continue the loop" (since I cant return a continue, ofc)</p>  <p>This is what I want:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/MWvlp.gif" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/MWvlp.gif" alt="animation"></a></p>  <p>Some suggestion?
