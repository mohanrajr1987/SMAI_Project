<p>How can I call setTimeout without class properties and other variables loosing scope and becoming undefined? The answer to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32270228/class-property-looses-scope-and-cant-be-set-after-settimeout">this question regarding variable scope with setTimeout</a> was to use a function closure so a 'snapshot' of the in-scope variables was taken and maintained during the setTimeout. This does not seem to work within a class however. For example</p>  <pre><code>class MyClass  public var MyVar:Number;  Function A_Closure(){      FunctionC(); };  Function B(){      MyVar = 10;      setTimeout(A_Closure, 1000); };  Function C(){      trace("MyVar = " + MyVar); // returns Undefined };  }; // End class </code></pre>  <p>This returns Undefined for MyVar. If I move Function A_Closure to a non-class .as file everything works OK and MyVar = 10, but this seems like a very hacky approach. Is there a recognised way to use setTimeout within a class? </p>  <p>I'm restricted to AS2 for this project (Scaleform within CryEngine).</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
