<p>I want to make a scoring system that shows star based on points like angry birds.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>if you get:  3 points = 3 stars,   1-2 points = 2 stars, 0 = 1 star</p> </blockquote>  <p>The stars will be an image. The points will save after answering all of the three questions. The points will appear in the form of star like above. I desperately need this.</p>
