<p>I'm using the HTML control in my application and when I close the application the complete event is getting dispatched right before close. Is there an onunload or some other event causing this to be dispatched? </p>  <p>Here is my code:  </p>  <pre><code>html.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, completeHandler); </code></pre>  <p>It just occurred to me the page that I'm loading might have an unload event and that is loading another page in the time it's taking the application to close. </p>
