<p>I have been looking for a way to install the debug version of flashplayer for ie11 or the newer microsoft edge browser under Windows 10. AS far as I understand, the flash plugin is now embedded with both browsers, so there is no way to update it to a debug version. Using the debug version installer from adobe site (active x version), gives me a pop-up stating that I already have the latest verion which is true, but there seems to be no way to change my version with the debug one. AS anyone succeed in using the debug version of flash undex one of these browser on Windows 10 (64bits)?</p>  <p>Thanks,</p>
