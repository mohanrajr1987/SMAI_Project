<p>-For as long as I can remember, I always thought that interfaces in Java and C# would only allow the following in an interface --constants --method signatures</p>  <p>1) How can C# allow interface's to have member variables with getters/setters?</p>  <pre><code>public interface IEntityBase {     ObjectId _id { get; set; } } </code></pre>  <p>2) Would Java allow for something similar to the aforementioned C# code?</p>
