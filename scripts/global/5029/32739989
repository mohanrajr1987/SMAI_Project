<p>Please help me out a little bit. I've inherited a firewall made of CentOS 6 and I'm a bit affraid to modify the iptables at all, but I have to do it for a task.</p>  <p>The tanks is to make one client in the office accessable from the internet but only on one port. Internet comes on the interface ppp0, clients are being serverd on the eth1. And I have to forward the port 80 to 3000. And our public IP to the clients IP. :D Sounds secure and easy right?</p>  <p>I've come up with a sollution, but I'm affraid to give it a go until I'm sure. Please make me sure of it. :D</p>  <pre><code>iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i ppp0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.1.2.3:3000 </code></pre>
