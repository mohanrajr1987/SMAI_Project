<p>I have for example an Interface A and B. A has an (abstract) method called foo. B extends A.</p>  <p>It is possible to override foo in the interface B even with @Override, but is there any situation where that makes sense? There is nothing to override, because both methods have to be abstract and have no body. So I guess there is no situation where this makes sense, right?</p>  <p>So why is it possible to override in an interface?</p>
