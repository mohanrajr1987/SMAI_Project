<p>I'm looking to build an interface that would be able to read data (speed, attitude, etc) that is located on an actual unmanned vehicle and display the data in a virtual speedometer interface perhaps like Microsoft flight sim.</p>  <p>Im also looking to be show the information with a video feed of a webcam attached to the vehicle, hence making it look as if you are in the vehicle itself, however controlling it remotely. Kinda like how in flight simulators, you have the different interfaces on the screen, with the outdoor view in the background.</p>  <p>Any tips on where i could get started?  Would attaching a virtual speedometer and attitude indicator with a live video feed background be possible?  Any help would greatly be appreciated! </p>
