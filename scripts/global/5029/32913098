<p>I have three assemblies. A main executable, a common library and an extension. In the extension, I need to implement a certain interface coming from the common assembly in order to register the class as a service in a static <code>Kernel</code> class. </p>  <p>The only problem, I don't have access to some types needed to implement the interface. For instance, the interface <code>A</code> has a method <code>DoWork()</code> that has a return type <code>B</code>. The extension assembly doesn't have the <code>B</code> type in its references and it cannot be added. </p>  <p>Is there a way to implement the interface, make the method throw a <code>NotImplementedException</code> and have the extension assembly compile?</p>  <p>Note, the main assembly needs to reference the extension in order to register it, so I can't reference the main assembly in the extension and declare the type in the main one.</p>
