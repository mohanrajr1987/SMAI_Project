<p>I'm an 18 year old apprentice in c# programming (specificly in OOP 'structure')</p>  <p>I'm currently trying to learn the use/usefullness of Interfaces, but.. I have a VERY hard time trying to actually use Interfaces, I've decided to start working on problems from <a href="https://projecteuler.net/archives" rel="nofollow">Project Euler</a>. What I want to do with these problems is to try and implement Interfaces or anything I need to learn so that I get some experience with it.</p>  <p>I'm currently at <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=2" rel="nofollow">Problem 2</a> but I can't think of a way to implement Interfaces.</p>  <p>So in general what I would like to ask is, what and how can I do this (please don't give me the final result, I am only looking for an idea or help to get started)</p>  <p>I feel like I'm stuck in a hole, unable to continue, so I would love some inspiration, examples or litteraly anything where I can get good and concise information! :)</p>  <p>In advance, thank you very much for your help/constructive criticism.</p>  <p>-Kindest Regards, Niklas</p>
