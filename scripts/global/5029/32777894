<p>I know that there are some basic implementation of interface in java everywhere in the net, but i am just curious, is there any other implementation of it for me to understand it better?</p>  <p>I've seen some complex example of interface in some button case, like when we do the addEventListener or onClick(), it has some kind of interfacing process in it. The problem is, I need another case of example for me to understand it better.</p>  <p>Can someone help? I think interface can be used to report something or to retrieve some algorithm from outside of the class.</p>
