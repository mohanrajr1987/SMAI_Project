<p>If we see the definitions like Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler or Map.Entry in oracle docs, they are defined as public static interface. Wanted to know how is that achieved or written internally by Java? Because when we try to create some customize interface of similar pattern, the compiler throws exception at the dot(.)!</p>  <pre><code>public static interface Dot.Intf{ void disp(); } </code></pre>
