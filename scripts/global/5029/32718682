<p>I have created a CustomViewController and layed it out in interface builder. Then I am all set to use the CustomViewController's view as a subview in another viewcontroller but when I add it to the other viewcontroller the layout of the custom uivewcontroller becomes wrong.</p>  <p>What can cause this? What is the propper way to do this?</p>  <p>The whole project can be found here <a href="https://github.com/agustr/STHLMPubCrawl" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/agustr/STHLMPubCrawl</a> just download and run (in an iphone 5 simulator). If there is any question about how it should look you can just move the initial view pointer to the 'place view controller cene'</p>  <p>this is the code:</p>  <pre><code>    let storyboard = UIStoryboard(name: "Main", bundle: nil)     let vc = storyboard.instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier("GPPlaceViewController") as? GPPlaceViewController     if vc != nil{          vc?.view.layer.borderWidth = 4         vc?.view.layer.borderColor = UIColor.redColor().CGColor          self.GPPlaceView.layer.borderColor = UIColor.yellowColor().CGColor         self.GPPlaceView.layer.borderWidth = 2          vc?.view.frame.size =  self.GPPlaceView.frame.size          self.GPPlaceView.addSubview(vc!.view)     }     else {         print("could not load GPPlacePageViewController from storyboard")     } </code></pre>  <p>Any help is welcome.</p>
