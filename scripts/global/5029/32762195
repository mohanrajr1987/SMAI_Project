<p>While working with a PHP project and updating an interface while the implementing class is open in a different tab, I often encounter that the implementation is <em>invalidated</em> due to changes in the signature of the method (e.g parameter type is changed). The implementation gets an annoying red underline also even if the method is renamed.</p>  <p>If I restart the editor then the method is no longer marked as invalid. This leads me to believe that the resolution of the contract is stale or outdated. Actually, I just discovered that if I wait for a while (e.g while writing this question and going back to make a screen shot), then the interface is resolved correctly. Thus I think that some indexing process in PhpStorm is running in the background.</p>  <p>My question is: How can I trigger the interface &lt;-> implementation resolution at whim or increase the frequency of those periodic re-scans.</p>  <p>The filesystem is ext4, mounted locally:</p>  <pre><code>/dev/mapper/balmora-root on / type ext4 (rw,noatime,data=ordered) </code></pre>  <p>PhpStorm is 9.0.2</p>
