<p>I have a Component in a component diagram that provides several interfaces. Now i'd like a class in a class diagram that describes this component to implement this interface. </p>  <p>What i tried:</p>  <ul> <li>Drag the interface into the class model --> results in the message 'When dropping embedded elements to a diagram, you must drop them on theit correct owner.'</li> <li>Creating the interface in the class model, then trying to link it with the interface in the component model --> I didn't find a way to accomplish that.</li> <li>Adding the class to the component model and add a realization to the exposed interface. This results in pretty arrows, but the class is in the component model. If I remove it from the model, the interfaces are still in the linked element list of the class, but i have found no way to add the interfaces to the model then, neither show in another way that this class implements those interfaces.</li> </ul>  <p>Any proposals how to accomplish that?</p>
