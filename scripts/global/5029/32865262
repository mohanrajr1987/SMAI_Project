<p>I'm very new to pfSense, but got requested to configure one for the company.</p>  <p>I've almost got everything configured, but am stuck at how to let all our WANs go through one uplink address. From what I am hearing, this should be possible to accomplish. I've tried looking it up on both the pfSense Guide as well as the forums, but since I can't find a related situation to mine, I hereby ask you guys for some help.</p>  <p>What it looks like now (with example WAN IP's):</p>  <p>WAN1: 000.000.000.58 with internal IP addresses on LAN1: 192.168.1.1 - 192.168.1.245 WAN2: 000.000.000.61 with internal IP addresses on LAN2: 192.168.2.1 - 192.168.2.245 WAN3: 000.000.000.59 with internal IP addresses on LAN3: 192.168.3.1 - 192.168.3.245</p>  <p>The way I have it set up now is as follows:</p>  <p>-First I configured all the interfaces, whereas I now have 3 WAN interfaces with Static IPv4 addresses configured. Example: WAN1 interace has a static IP of 000.000.000.59 and an IPv4 Upstream Gateway: 000.000.000.57 (which would be the broadcast address for all WANs).</p>  <p>The problems start right here, because I can't add this address to anymore interfaces, because "it already exists", but isn't selectable from the drop-down menu. This is one of the reasons why we want one WAN interface to handle all three of our WAN addresses with one uplink address.</p>  <p>So the question in short: is there a way to have one uplink/upstream address for all WANs. And if so, is there also a way to have just one WAN interface and three LAN interfaces in the following way:</p>  <p>WAN interface must have an uplink/upstream gateway of: 000.000.000.57 for the following WAN addresses: 000.000.000.58, 000.000.000.59 and 000.000.000.61 whereas</p>  <p>WAN1: 000.000.000.58 = for LAN1 interface w/ internal range of: 192.168.1.1 - 192.168.1.245 WAN2: 000.000.000.61 = for LAN2 interface w/ internal range of: 192.168.2.1 - 192.168.2.245 WAN3: 000.000.000.59 = for LAN3 interface w/ internal range of: 192.168.3.1 - 192.168.3.245</p>  <p>WAN interface is not going to get a DHCP function, because it needs to be all three of the WAN addresses. The LAN interfaces are going to get the DHCP function for the ranges listed above.</p>  <p>In other words </p>  <ul> <li>all traffic from the 192.168.1.x range must go through the WAN interface as 000.000.000.58 and then through the uplink of: 000.000.000.57</li> <li>all traffic from the 192.168.2.x range must go through the WAN interface as 000.000.000.61 and then through the uplink of: 000.000.000.57</li> <li>all traffic from the 192.168.3.x range must go through the WAN interface as 000.000.000.59 and then through the uplink of: 000.000.000.57</li> </ul>  <p>Can this be done, yes or no?</p>  <p>If you need any more information, feel free to ask and I'll happily elaborate.</p>  <p>Thank you very much in advance!</p>  <p>Grtz,</p>  <p>Jeff</p>
