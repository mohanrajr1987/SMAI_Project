<p>I have a <code>City</code> class</p>  <pre><code>class City(object):    def __init__(self, name):      self.name = name </code></pre>  <p>Then I put it into a dictionary:</p>  <pre><code>c = City('NYC') cities = dict() cities[c] = 1 </code></pre>  <p>I can access NYC's value with <code>cities[c]</code>.  Could I do the same with <code>cities['NYC']</code>?  Basically, I want the <code>City</code> instance and <code>City.name</code> instance variable to refer to the same key.</p>  <p>I thought of having a separate dictionary <code>names = {'NYC': c}</code>, so I could do <code>cities[names['NYC']]</code>.  Are there better ways?  Ideally I won't need to use seperate variables and would only have to modify the internals of either <code>City</code> class or <code>cities</code> dictionary.</p>
