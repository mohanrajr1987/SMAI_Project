<p>I am trying to an existing game engine, and something I want to change is for the game to only render part of the map that is seen on screen, rather than rendering the entire map.  I have made a tiny bit of success so far, but it doesn't work correctly and I need some advice.</p>  <p>First, here is the original code for rendering the map in the game loop:</p>  <pre><code>    public void render(JFrame frame, Graphics2D g2d, int xx, int yy {         int xt = xx;         for(int y = 0; y &lt; mapHeight; y++) {             for(int x = 0; x &lt; mapWidth; x++) {                 mapTiles[x + y * mapWidth].renderTile(xx, yy, g2d, frame);                 xx = xx + spriteSize;             }             xx = xt;             yy = yy + spriteSize;         }     } </code></pre>  <p>The "xx" and "yy" passed are the camera coordinates. They change as the player moves (it's a free roam game, and the player stays on the center of the screen as the camera moves). The entire map is drawn tile by tile. Also, the "x + y * mapWidth" is a 1 dimensional array, the original creator of the code claims that using a 1 dimensional array over a 2 dimensional one increases the FPS in the end -- I don't know if there is any validity to the claim, but for now I'm leaving it alone.</p>  <p>I created a method to get the current tile the player is standing on, and doing so tried to create the code to only draw tiles that are visible on screen. My code looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>public void render(JFrame frame, Graphics2D g2d, int mapX, int mapY, int currentTileX, int currentTileY {     int startX = mapX;         int startY = mapY;         for(int y = currentTileY - 5; y &lt; currentTileY + 6; y++) {             for(int x = currentTileX - 9; x &lt; currentTileX + 10; x++) {                 if (x &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; y &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; x &lt; mapWidth &amp;&amp; y &lt; mapHeight)                 {                     mapTiles[x + y * mapWidth].renderTile(startX, startY, g2d, frame);                 }                 startX += 64;             }                startX = mapX;             startY += 64;         } </code></pre>  <p>In this code, I tried only drawing the part of the map that's visible on screen based on the camera. The screen width holds 19 tiles, and the height holds 11 tiles, and that part does work. However, when moving (which changes the mapx/mapy), the next tile in the series will not show even though it is technically viewable on screen. If the current tile changes, the entire map seems to "skip" forward, rather than making a smooth transition, and the player is sent to the next tile after the one the player should have moved to.</p>  <p>Does anyone have any ideas on how to fix my code/a different solution to making this work? </p>
