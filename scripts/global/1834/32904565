<p>Is there a hashing based data structure where I can search an item in O(1) time on both key and value. </p>  <p>This can be achieved by adding duplicate entry in the list for each key value par by reversing key and value, but it will take double the space.</p>  <p>This kind of data structure might be useful in some scenarios: like I want to store opening and closing parenthesis in a map and while parsing the string, I can just check in the map if the key is present without worrying about whether it is opening-closing map or closing-opening map or without storing duplicate.</p>  <p>I hope I am clear enough!!</p>
