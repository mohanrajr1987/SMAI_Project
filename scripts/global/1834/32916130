<p>I have a requirement to use Bing Map API and shows the City, State or STATE or Country as auto suggestion. I have explored the different options and can not achieve all the requirements from single query (either by using location by address or query rest API). Here the requirement in detail </p>  <p>1.) System should show nearest city, state based on the input. 2.) System should show nearest State based on the input. 3.) System should show country name if any matches available. </p>  <p>I have tried to use </p>  <p><a href="http://dev.virtualearth.net/REST/v1/Locations/Texa?key=MyKey" rel="nofollow">http://dev.virtualearth.net/REST/v1/Locations/Texa?key=MyKey</a> but this is not showing nearest location as first option.</p>  <p><a href="https://dev.virtualearth.net/REST/v1/Locations?jsonp=asdasd&amp;locality=Texa&amp;countryRegion=US&amp;maxResults=10&amp;c=en-US" rel="nofollow">https://dev.virtualearth.net/REST/v1/Locations?jsonp=asdasd&amp;locality=Texa&amp;countryRegion=US&amp;maxResults=10&amp;c=en-US</a> but this is not returing the result outside of US. </p>  <p>I am looking a approach to combine both the queries which will show location from globe but nearest on always as first.</p>  <p>Thanks Sourabh K.</p>
