<p>I have following code:</p>  <pre><code>users.stream()                 .sorted((u1, u2) -&gt; u2.getScore().compareTo(u1.getScore()))                 .limit(count)                 .collect(Collectors.toMap((User::getName), (User::getScore))); </code></pre>  <p>Content of result is right  but when I want to foreach it - it output in unpredictable result. I think it is because under the hood HashMap is used.</p>  <p>Is there way to collect to mp with predictable result?</p>
