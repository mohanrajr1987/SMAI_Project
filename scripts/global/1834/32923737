<p>Is there a way to return routing in transit mode (eg. using public transport) using WP 8.1 native maps service API?</p>  <p>Some side questions:</p>  <ol> <li><p>WP 8.1 native maps API is using Bing Maps API or HERE maps API now?</p></li> <li><p>Are HERE apps such as HERE maps, drive+, and transit stop support on Windows platform now? As they are not available anymore in the app store.</p></li> </ol>  <p>Appreciate any reply, thanks. </p>
