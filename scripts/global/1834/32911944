<p>I am currently facing a bit of a problem regarding the use of dictionaries, and I can't really seem to solve it. Here is basically what the problem is;</p>  <p>I have a dictionary like so:</p>  <pre><code>let dict : Dictionary&lt;String, String&gt; = ["Word1":"Word2", "Word3":""Word4"] </code></pre>  <p>So basically this is what my Dictionary looks like, except it's way bigger with probably over 400 "Word1:Word2"-words. The thing is that when I run the code, it builds successfully - but when I run the code in the simulator I can an error of type EXC_Bad_Instruction. This suddenly occurred when it (from what it looks like) exceeded a specific number. Let's say when I try to add in "Word5:Word6". Then I get an error, but if I just keep it with Word1:Word2 and Word3:Word4, then it runs.</p>  <p>Could someone please help me with this, as it's really frustrating - as I've tried to look for 'nil's' in my code, but with no luck.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
