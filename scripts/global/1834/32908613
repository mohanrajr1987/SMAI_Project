<p>I would like to rank the values in a dictionary.</p>  <p>For instance, I have this dictionary: <code>{"A": 10, "B: 3, "C": 8, "D": 3, "E": 2}</code> The result should look like: <code>{"E": 1, "B": 2, "D": 2, "C": 4, "A": 5}</code></p>  <p>Please note that <code>D</code> is ranked as <em>fourth</em> because <code>B</code> and <code>D</code> are tied at position <em>two</em>. Hence, there is no position <em>three</em>.</p>  <p>Similar solutions have already been given in other threads, however they did not take into account ex-aequo positions in the traditional way: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23641054/adding-a-rank-to-a-dict-in-python">Adding a rank to a dict in python</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30282600/python-ranking-dictionary-return-rank/30282676">Python Ranking Dictionary Return Rank</a></p>
