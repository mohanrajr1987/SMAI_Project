<p>Just curious more than anything else, but why isn't a dictionary such as the one below not ordered the same as it was created? But when I print out <code>test</code> it returns the same order from then on...</p>  <pre><code>test = {'one':'1', 'two':'2', 'three':'3', 'four':'4'} </code></pre>  <p>It's not that I need them ordered, but it's just been on my mind for awhile as to what is occurring here.</p>  <p>The only thing I've found on this is a quote from <a href="http://www.openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english2e/ch12.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> article:</p>  <p><strong><em>Python uses complex algorithms to determine where the key-value pairs are stored in a dictionary.</em></strong></p>  <p>But what are these "complex algorithms" and why? </p>
