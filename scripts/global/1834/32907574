<p>I am using C# 4.5 on my winform.  I have a Dictionary with a Tuple named ParamList that uses this:</p>  <pre><code>new Dictionary&lt;Tuple&lt;string, string&gt;, string&gt;(); </code></pre>  <p>I am able to iterate through ParamList to place the elements in my ComboBox.  What I want to be able to do is move the elements up or down with a button click event or remove an element altogether with a different button click. I cannot figure out how to do so.  Thanks.</p>
