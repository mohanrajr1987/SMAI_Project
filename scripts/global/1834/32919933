<p>I have a <code>cell_array</code> for which <code>29136x1 cell</code> value shows in the workspace pallet. I also have a map  <code>new_labels</code> with <code>4x1 Map</code> in workspace pallet. Printing <code>new_label</code> on prompt gives</p>  <pre><code>new_labels =     Map with properties:          Count: 4       KeyType: char     ValueType: double </code></pre>  <p>Each entry in the cell_array is the key in the map, but the problem is there a type mismatch as <code>keyType</code> in map is char and entries of <code>cell_array</code> are of type <code>cell</code>.</p>  <p>Because of this I cannot access the map and hence something like the following:</p>  <pre><code>arrayfun(@(x) new_labels(x), cell_array, 'un',0); </code></pre>  <p>gives error <code>Specified key type does not match the type expected for this container.</code></p>  <p>I tried converting to char type using <code>char_cell_array = char(cell_array)</code> but that converts the array to be of size <code>29136x4</code> which means every entry is just one <code>char</code> and not really a string.</p>  <p>Any help appreciated.</p>
