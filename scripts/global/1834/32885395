<p>How can Nancy's automatic conversion between camel and Pascal casing during serialization to and deserialization from JSON be disabled for objects representing dictionaries in C# <strong>and</strong> JavaScript?</p>  <p>In my case the keys of these dictionaries are IDs that must not be changed by the automatic case conversion.</p>  <p>Additionally, these dictionaries themselves are values of other object's property names / keys.</p>  <p>Here is an example JavaScript object, where I <strong>want</strong> the auto case conversion for the object (<code>.customers</code> to <code>.Customers</code> and <code>.addresses</code> to <code>.Addresses</code>), but not for the ID-value sub-objects' keys (<code>ID33100a00</code>, <code>abc433D123</code>, etc.):</p>  <pre><code>{     customers: {         ID33100a00: 'Percy',         abc433D123: 'Nancy'     },     addresses: {         abc12kkhID: 'Somewhere over the rainbow',         JGHBj45nkc: 'Programmer\'s hell',         jaf44vJJcn: 'Desert'     } } </code></pre>  <p>These dictionary objects are all represented by <code>Dictionary&lt;string, T&gt;</code> in C#, e.g.:</p>  <pre><code>Dictionary&lt;string, Customer&gt; Customers; Dictionary&lt;string, Address&gt; Addresses; </code></pre>  <p>Unfortunately setting</p>  <pre><code>JsonSettings.RetainCasing = true; </code></pre>  <p>would result in no auto case conversion at all.</p>  <p>I also tried to solve the problem by writing my own <code>JavaScriptConverter</code> as described in <a href="https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy/wiki/Extending-Serialization-with-Converters" rel="nofollow">Nancy documentation</a>, but the actual serialization/deserialization to/from strings for the keys of objects takes place somewhere else (because the converter does not handle JSON strings directly, but <code>IDictionary&lt;string, object&gt;</code> objects).</p>  <p>I read about a related "bug" (or behavior) <a href="https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy/issues/1484" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
