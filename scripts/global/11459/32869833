<p>Im running magento 1.9.0.1</p>  <p>I had a rare situation. As I was completing a shipment, my server which is hosting magento overloaded/froze and resulted in a 404 page, shipment information was recorded in magento and now when I press "track" the tracking details are there and the shipment was created successfully but the order state remains as "processing". Anyway to fix it from the admin page or should I just go into the database and change the order state manually to "complete"? if I have to do it manually where in the database should I change it? This never happened before, I have processed thousands of orders and the order state always changes to "complete" as soon as I press complete/ship.</p>  <p>thanks</p>
