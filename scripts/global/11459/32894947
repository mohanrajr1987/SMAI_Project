<p>I have a dataframe in R with several columns of numerical values. I want to create another column showing the order of these columns (doesnt really matter if it's ascending or descending). A rough example:</p>  <pre><code>     a b    c  new column [1,] 1 3 10.0   c,b,a [2,] 2 1  0.5   a,b,c [3,] 3 4 11.0   c,b,a [4,] 4 7  2.0   b,a,c [5,] 5 8  0.1   b,a,c </code></pre>  <p>It seems like there must be some kind of function for this, but I haven't found anything. I would also need some kind of logic to deal with ties/values that are the same.</p>
