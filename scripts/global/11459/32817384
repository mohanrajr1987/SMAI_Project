<p>I have enabled ordering on my API, and it works just fine. My problem is that it only allows me to order by fields values. I want to be able to make a query like</p>  <pre><code>GET /api/some_endpoint/?crazy_query=123 </code></pre>  <p>and then, even though the model has no field <code>crazy_field</code>, I want to be able to respond to it somehow. I just don't know where do do it. The <code>OrderingFilter</code> is currently injected into all my viewsets by use of setting <code>DEFAULT_FILTER_BACKENDS</code>. I guess I would have to create a custom filter backend, but I'm unsure how to go about it</p>
