<p>I have a table with the column 'time' which stores timestamps. I want to order it so that if the timestamp is in the future (ie. greater than what PHP's time() function returns), it orders it ascending. If it is not in the future, order it descending in value.</p>  <p>EDIT: Suppose I had this list of timestamps (I know they're not actual ones, but for simplicity's sake):</p>  <pre><code>1896 779 468 1478 846 1384 </code></pre>  <p>Then supppose the current timestamp is '1000'. The list should be reordered by the query to look something like this:</p>  <pre><code>1384 1478 1896 846 779 468 </code></pre>  <p>So effectively all the data above 1000 is sorted ASC, and all data below is sorted DESC.</p>
