<p>Suppose, I have a file <em>(file.txt)</em> that contain few numbers with characters.</p>  <pre><code>1 2 3 4 (23)  23 2 1 (51)  2 1 4 (11) </code></pre>  <p>And, I would like to read it in reverse order as given below. </p>  <pre><code>(23) 4 3 2 1  (51) 1 2 23  (11) 4 1 2 </code></pre>  <p><strong>I tried:</strong> </p>  <pre><code>awk '{print $NF,$0}' file.txt | sort -nr </code></pre>  <p>Is there a command-line in <strong>Linux</strong> or a mini-code <em>(in AWK or in C++ or some other language)</em> to perform this task?</p>
