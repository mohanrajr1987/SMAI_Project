<p>I am looking to select a subset of data from a table but would like to ensure I get an equal mix of different 'types' from a column.</p>  <p>For example, if the table had a column called 'animal' that was populated with the following:</p>  <pre><code>name, animal 'Bob', 'cat' 'Fred','cat' 'Jim','dog' 'Sam','dog' 'Andy','snake' 'Paul','snake' </code></pre>  <p>I would like to select the rows in an order that has an even mix of animal types, so the result would be:</p>  <pre><code>['Bob','cat'], ['Jim','dog'], ['Andy','snake'], ['Fred','cat'], ['Sam','dog'], ['Paul','snake'] </code></pre>  <p>Similar to randomising, but ensuring that all types are included equally. Is there a way to do this in mysql? </p>
