<p>Sorry if this was asked before, and if it was, just drop a link.  I'm fairly new to C++.</p>  <p>I have a project that requires me to create a Twitter-like program; where each User has their own wall, homepage, friends list, inbox, etc. The problem is is that I have to turn in one .cpp file; I have to put all classes on one file. Now since C++ reads from top to bottom, I'm having an issue with creating/referencing other classes because they haven't been defined yet.</p>  <p>For instance, since User contains an object made from my FriendsList class, I have to put FriendsList first, but then there's an issue where I can't make an array that holds User because User hasn't been defined yet.</p>  <p>Sorry if this is a stupid question.</p>  <p>Edit: How would I go about forward declaration?</p>  <pre><code>class FriendsList; class User() {     FriendsList* friends;      //constructor and other stuff }; class FriendsList() { //stuff }; </code></pre>  <p>Would it be like that? Sorry I'm just confused.</p>
