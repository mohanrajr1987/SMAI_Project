<p>I have Array of Strings like:</p>  <pre><code>String arr[] = {"1", "1.1", "1.1.1", "1.1.1.1", "1.2", "2", "2.1", "3.3", "4", "7.3"}; </code></pre>  <p>and I want to make a hierarchical representation of it so the result to be like:</p>  <pre><code>[1]     [1.1, 1.2]           [1.1.1]               [1.1.1.1] [2]     [2.1] [3.3] [4] [7.3] </code></pre>  <p>How to do that? Using recursion or? The Strings are sorted properly.</p>  <p><strong>Edit</strong>: Tags like [3.3],[7.3] I want to be on the first level. If i Have 8.8.1.1.1 also to be on the first level.  So for that reason I thought that with recursion will be possible but can not make it. I do not wat just to print them but then to make some processing with custom logic, so want to put them in hierarchical structure and to get childs from different levels. I tried with TreeSet but from what I understand, the internal representation is Tree but the structure do not have get child on second level and so on. </p>  <p>Here there are multiple roots so, instead of tree we need "forest" data structure, or list with trees. I could not find such in Java API.</p>
