<p>What is the order relationship between f(n) = 10n and g(n) = n^(nmod6)?</p>  <p>I know that I can think of f(n) as just n, but thinking about g(n) confuses me because won't nmod6 change with the different values of n? For example, n = 6 would make g(n) = n^0 = 1 but when n = 5, g(n) = n ^ 5. How can I think of this with respect to the Big-Oh, Big-Theta, and Big-Omega relationships?</p>
