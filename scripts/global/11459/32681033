<p>I use the following MySQL query to get results, sorted alphabetically by name:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT * FROM `client` WHERE CONCAT(name, ', ', firstname) LIKE "%ti%" ORDER BY name </code></pre>  <p>In some way the results get sorted, so the ORDER BY works. Unfortunately it works not as expected. The above query gives the following order for example:</p>  <pre><code>Kostic (31) Hatscher (30) </code></pre>  <p>Why is Kostic listed first? Prove me wrong, but K comes after H in the alphabet... (If it helps - the name field is type of varchar.)</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/0iFYB.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/0iFYB.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
