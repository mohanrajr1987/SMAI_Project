<p>I read data from a file using read.table as <code>i&lt;- read.table("path", header=T,sep="\t",stringsAsFactors = FALSE)</code> <code>x &lt;- i$Window</code>. The values of x are in the order +100, -200, +300, -400 etc I donot want ggplot to re-order it and want to reatin the same order s read from file. I tried many things like <code>i$Window &lt;- factor(i$Window, levels=c("+100","-200","+300","-400"), order =FALSE)</code>. But everything orders the x-axis. I saw many similar question here, but nothing helped. Could you please suggest something, especially without hard coding the x-axis values would be better, as the number and value of elements are variable.</p>
