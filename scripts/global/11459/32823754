<p>I am storing images in file system and updating the image path in database. </p>  <p><strong>Table structure</strong></p>  <p>photo_id,user_id,photo_no,photo_url</p>  <p>Users can upload maximum of 5 photos. photo_no is the field where i store the order. The first photo will be always the main photo. But users can make any photo as main photo and they can also arrange the photo.</p>  <p>If the user wants to make the 3rd photo as main photo(photo_no 1). Then i have to update photo_no 3 to some dummy temp number and  update photo_no 1 with 3 and update temp number with 1. This way i can swap the photos. But i don't think this to be a good method. Can any suggest a good way to do that. </p>  <p>is possible to handle this situation with a good table design?</p>
