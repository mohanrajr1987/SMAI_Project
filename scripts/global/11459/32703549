<p>so i have an input txt file where i have to take the first 50 lines and reverse it's order so that the file will start with the 50th line, then the 49th, until the 1st, then continues with the 100th line followed by the 99th, and so on...</p>  <p>but i can only store at most 50 elements. i can't store more than that. the code i've written so far only grabs the first 50 lines and reverses them, but i dont know how to make it continue on.</p>  <p>this is what i have so far:</p>  <pre><code>ArrayList&lt;String&gt; al = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;(); int running = 0;  while(running == 0) {     for (String line = r.readLine(); line != null; line = r.readLine()) {         if(al.size() &lt;50 ) {             al.add(line);         }     }     Collections.reverse(al);     for (String text : al) {         w.println(text);     }      if(al.size() &lt; 50) {         break;     }     al.clear(); } </code></pre>  <p>idk why my while loop won't keep running, im only getting the first 50 lines reversed in my output file.</p>
