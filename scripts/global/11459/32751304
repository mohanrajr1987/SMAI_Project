<p>I have created a table by sorted data.. There are 3 columns, and I want to "hide" 1 column on the output. I do NOT want to remove it from my data frame, as the column I want to "hide" is the one that is being used to sort. NULL will not work because then my data frame will not sort. This is the code I have:</p>  <pre><code>HighJ&lt;-c("Ja","Jo") TableTopJ&lt;-subset(BabyNamesFirstTwoSort, FirstTwo %in% HighJ) print(TableTopJ[order(TableTopJ$FirstTwo,TableTopJ$Rank),],                       row.names=FALSE) </code></pre>  <p>I would like to "hide" TableTopJ$FirstTwo from the output. I have tried using NULL but like I said it removes it from the data frame and therefore I cannot sort by it.</p>
