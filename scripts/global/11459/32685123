<p>lets say im given a txt file with lines of strings, where i have to take the first 50 lines and print them in reverse order(to clarify: the line does not change, but the order changes...50th line becomes 1st, 49th becomes 2nd, etc...) and then again for the next 50 lines until all lines are reversed. </p>  <p>So far i have multiple for loops going through 50 lines at a time and reversing them. But is there a more efficient way to do this? i was thinking of stacks, however i dont know how to manipulate the elements in a stack over than pop() and push().</p>  <p>this is what i got so far</p>  <pre><code>    for(int x = 49; x&gt;=0; x--){          System.out.println(s.get(x));     }      for(int x = 149; x&gt;=100; x--){          System.out.println(s.get(x));     }     ...     ... </code></pre>
