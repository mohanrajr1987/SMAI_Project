What is the best method to reorder thies with a "+" and "-" button?</p>  <p>I thouth of saveing all the controls in a <code>List&lt;Controls&gt;</code> And then reorder them with something like </p>  <pre><code>ControlList[1] = ControlList[2] </code></pre>  <p>and then inset all the controls from the list into the FlowLayoutPanel. But this just  dosnt seem to work out for me. Is there a easy way of doing this smart?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/VMiSy.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/VMiSy.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
