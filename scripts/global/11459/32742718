<p>I have a problem with creating select query ordered by following logic:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT * FROM Products WHERE 1 ORDER BY Stock &gt; 0, Price DESC </code></pre>  <p>Table sample:</p>  <pre><code>+---------+-------+-------+ | Product | Price | Stock | +---------+-------+-------+ | Car     |  3500 |    30 | | Boat    |  7500 |     6 | | Bike    |   150 |   220 | | Plane   | 55000 |     0 | +---------+-------+-------+ </code></pre>  <p>The desired result is, that the table will be ordered by price if the stock value is greater than 0.</p>  <p>So the result should be:</p>  <pre><code>+---------+-------+-------+ | Product | Price | Stock | +---------+-------+-------+ | Boat    |  7500 |     6 | | Car     |  3500 |    30 | | Bike    |   150 |   220 | | Plane   | 55000 |     0 | +---------+-------+-------+ </code></pre>  <p>Any ideas?</p>
