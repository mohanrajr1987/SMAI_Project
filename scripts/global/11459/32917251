<p>I'm doing some basic data processing stuff with Stata. However, I get stuck on how to keep the observations of the other variables matching, after modifying a variable's value label.  </p>  <p>For example, say, I have the raw dataset as follows:</p>  <pre><code>   var1   var2   var3     US    1000    15   China    500    20     UK     800    10 </code></pre>  <p>The <em>var1</em> is a string variable. I need to convert it into a numeric one. So I typed </p>  <pre><code>   encode var1, gen(country)    // where the new variable country is numeric </code></pre>  <p>The variables that I want for future work are <em>var2</em>, <em>var3</em> and <em>country</em>. </p>  <p>When the new variable is generated, it automatically has a value label. To be specific, if I click on US in the column of <em>country</em>, it shows 3 in the cell on top of the column.</p>  <pre><code>   var1   var2   var3  country     US    1000    15     US   China    500    20   China     UK     800    10     UK </code></pre>  <p>So far it's good. I mean for each row the observations match. </p>  <p>However, this automatically generated value label is not exactly what I want. What I need is to make 1 denote UK, 2 for US and 3 for China. So I modified it by:</p>  <pre><code>     label define country 1 "UK" 2 "US" 3 "China", modify </code></pre>  <p>As shown below, I get the value labels that I want. Like, a click on China gives me 3.  </p>  <pre><code>     var1   var2   var3  country       US    1000    15    China     China    500    20     UK       UK     800    10     US </code></pre>  <p>But the point is, as you may already notice, the order of the observations for <em>country</em> is arranged alphabetically. It makes the corresponding values of <em>var2</em> and <em>var3</em> for each country to be wrong. </p>  <p>That is exactly where I could not get through. Since the columns that I finally need are <em>var2</em>, <em>var3</em> and <em>country</em>, I'd like to have each country with its corresponding values of <em>var2</em>, <em>var3</em> and as well the customized value labels. </p>  <p>I tried <em>sort</em>, <em>order</em> and a couple of commands but none gave me the result. I don't know what command I should use or there's something wrong in my earlier work. </p>
