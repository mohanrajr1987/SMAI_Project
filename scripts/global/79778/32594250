<p>Does anyone have an example of working with progress bar while copying file or can direct me to a place where this question has been asked? </p>  <pre><code>    private void Transferfiles(DirectoryInfo source, DirectoryInfo target)     {         int e = 0         if (Directory.Exists(target.FullName) == false)         {                  Directory.CreateDirectory(target.FullName);          }         foreach (FileInfo eachhfile in source.GetFiles())         {                 eachhfile.CopyTo(Path.Combine(target.ToString(), eachhfile .Name));                 BytesToKilobytes += ((eachhfile .Length / 1024) / 1024);                 e = BytesToKilobytes ;                 backgroundWorker1.ReportProgress(e);          }         foreach (DirectoryInfo SubDirectory in source.GetDirectories())         {                 DirectoryInfo newTargetDirectory =                     target.CreateSubdirectory(diSourceSubDir.Name);                 Transferfiles(SubDirectory, newTargetDirectory );         }     } </code></pre>  <p>above is the code i use so far, it works but it doesn't really give me what i want. Am looking for a way to make the progress bar move gentle as the file is copying, so if the file is 1GB the progress bar should keep moving until the file finish copying.</p>
