<p>After searching for a while how to make a progress bar, I came with a couple scripts that can help me make a progress bar but I can't find anything that fits my needs or have a good documentation to learn ( as my JS / Jquery ) is not good at all.</p>  <p>I really need a progress bar that can make the following:</p>  <p>Style:  - Youtube Style ( there are plently there but it's a must to don't waste site space )</p>  <p>Features:  - Custom time to progress ( 10 seconds / 20 seconds / 60 seconds, etc ) - The timer will start when the document is ready or have been passed X seconds ( custom seconds ) ( Example: If the page isnt ready after 5 seconds, the progress bar starts counting ) - The page must be opened ( custom ) ( If the page isn't focused, the progress bar pause ) and only start from the pause point when the user go the tab) - On finish, it need to be able to check a php file and get the result and show a message deppending on the result.</p>  <p>Does anyone know an already script that have those functions? I can't find anything like that. Or better, if anyone could throw me an example in how to do it, would be great.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
