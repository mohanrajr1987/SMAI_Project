<p>I have two Activities, BookStoreActivity and BookDetailActivity. In BookStoreActivity, when I click on BookItem, it will go to BookDetailActivity. In BookDetailActivity, when I click "Download" book, it will show download progress in BookDetailActivity.</p>  <p>I also want to show progress update in BookItem's of BookStoreActivity. The two progress update must be the same. Now I'm using <a href="https://github.com/loopj/android-async-http" rel="nofollow">AsyncHttpClient</a> from loopj.com. It is look like Google Play App Downloading process.</p>  <p>Please see the image: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5F5g1.png" rel="nofollow">http://i.stack.imgur.com/5F5g1.png</a>. First is App's Detail and Second is My AppList, I want to like that.</p>
