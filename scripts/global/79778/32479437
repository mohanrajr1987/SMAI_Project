<p>Hello I have an issue with progress bars inside my code. First of all, pseudo version of my code</p>  <pre><code>namespace prog {     public partial class Form1 : Form     {     public Form1()        {        InitializeComponent();        t = new Thread(new ThreadStart(long_function));        }       private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) // go!       {        if ((t.ThreadState &amp; ThreadState.Unstarted) == ThreadState.Unstarted)         {             t.IsBackground = true;             t.Start();         }        }       private void progressBar1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)       {        }       public void long_function(int a, //and a few other arguments)       {       //a is set by user (from textbox)       progressBar1.Maximum = a;       while(p &lt; a)       progressBar1.Increment(1);         p++       }       } } </code></pre>  <p>It works, but inside "long_function" is plenty of if's and for's . For big instances progress bar is jamming and it isn't work properly. I've read about a backgroundworker but this is a hunderds of lines, and I don't know how to put it inside my code. Usually Backgroundworker is outside of the calculating function. However I'd like to use it inside of my calculating function .</p>
