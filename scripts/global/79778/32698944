<p>I have a question relating progress bars in R, which are shown as a pop-up window. We are using Shiny locally on both Windows and Mac operating systems for the development phase. We would like to use the progress bar as a pop-up message because this is easier to show on Shiny. Now, in order to see the progress bar in Windows you can simply do something like:</p>  <pre><code>pb &lt;- winProgressBar("test progress bar", "Some information in %",                  0, 100, 50)  u &lt;- c(0, sort(runif(20, 0 ,100)), 100) for(i in u) { Sys.sleep(0.1) info &lt;- sprintf("%d%% done", round(i)) setWinProgressBar(pb, i, sprintf("test (%s)", info), info) } Sys.sleep(5) close(pb) </code></pre>  <p>The nice thing is that Shiny also pushes this pop-up to your screen. We want to do something similar on a Mac and these lines are not working on IOS. </p>  <p>Does anyone have suggestions to get this up-and-running for Mac users, i.e. other packages or ideas to get a progress bar for Mac.</p>  <p>Thank you</p>
