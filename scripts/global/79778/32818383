<p>I'd like to implement a control similar to Xcode progress bar:<a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/F2KYg.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/F2KYg.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>The bezel looks like a standard Textured Rounded button, but my problem is if I subclass NSButton and override drawing code I don't know where bezel edges are. They are some pixels off from the control bounds. This is how my button looks if I fill bounds with blue color before calling NSButton drawing code:<a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/XLw5k.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/XLw5k.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>My concern is if I just hardcode these margins then they may change with system updates and progress bar will look out of place. Maybe I'm missing some obvious way to implement this?</p>
