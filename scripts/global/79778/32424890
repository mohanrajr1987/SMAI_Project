<p>I'm uploading a fairly large json with urllib2 to a server-side script via POST.<br> I want to display a progress indicator that shows the current upload progress.<br> Is there a hook or a callback provided by urllib2 that allows me to monitor upload progress?<br> This is similar to this question here <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5925028/urllib2-post-progress-monitoring">urllib2 POST progress monitoring</a> but the answer described their only works with files and not with data types on the ram(like JSONs and strings).<br> *Saving the json to a file and then sending it is not an option for me.</p>
