<p>what is the standard way to create a Ruby on Rails slider progress bar for a crowdfunding website? </p>  <p>I am creating one and need a way to be able to show how much a specific campaign has fundraised and how much is left to reach campaign objective.</p>  <p>I have not been able to find anything that is specific Rails just only a few Jquery plugin. Is there anything simpler that can be done without having to resort to Javascript/JQuery?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
