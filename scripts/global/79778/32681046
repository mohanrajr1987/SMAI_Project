<p>I am working on a game in which I want background music playing. I was wondering if there was a way to hide the progress bar of the music and only display the play and stop button with  the volume slider?</p>  <p>Right now I have resized the width so that the play button will only show, but when I change it to a bigger width to have the slider show, the progressbar comes back out. I want to get rid of the progress bar completely.</p>
