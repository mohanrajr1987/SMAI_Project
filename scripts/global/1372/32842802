<p>I am about to implement a <strong>turn-by-turn navigation</strong> using <strong>direction api</strong> and learnt how to get routes and extracting overview_polylines, parsing it and adding it to the map as a polylineOption. <strong>Now my Question is how to make that arrow that represents the current location?</strong> Does <strong>GPS</strong> have someting to do with it? And with GPS can I know where the device faces (NEWS)? Also, I am planning to <strong>use the devices sensors to predict the change in location</strong> of the device, just to make it feel like more responsive, is it possible? </p>  <p>I read about <strong>google places api</strong>, is it helpful? Can it determine where the device face?</p>  <p>Because what I think I could do is that, if I have the devices current location and it touches the polyline (meaning latlang of the current location intersects the list of latlng in the polyline), then I can start removing the latlng that already been covered, or not removing, just not drawing it on the map. My problem to this is that I know the devices cant possibly trace the polylines at zero-zero allowance, how to detect that the device is already on the polyline?</p>  <p>I am aiming to avoid hacking things and do it the right way. What is the best approach? </p>
