<p>I'm building an app that track user movement. I found on the net and I'm still  blocked about how to get a reliable user location. </p>  <p>For that purpose, I started by use the GPS_PROVIDER to get user location every minutes. But that drains a lot of battery. Now I'm using NETWORK_PROVIDER which have better yield on battery, but as per my understanding, is not really accurate.</p>  <p>So firstly, I want to know to deal between usage of those providers to have good yield regarding battery consumption and user location accuracy.</p>  <p>Secondly, I read there (<a href="https://source.android.com/devices/sensors/sensor-types.html#significant_motion" rel="nofollow">Significant Motion</a>)  that: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>At the high level, the significant motion detector is used to reduce the power consumption of location determination. When the localization algorithms detect that the device is static, they can switch to a low power mode, where they rely on significant motion to wake the device up when the user is changing location.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Does it mean that this sensor is already used by GPS_NETWORK or that applications have to implement the described behavior?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
