<p>I've written an android application that needs the user location, it was working fine when I used gps provider, but I don't want to use GPS because it uses a lot of battery, here is my code </p>  <pre><code>LocationManager locaionManager = (LocationManager) getSystemService(Context.LOCATION_SERVICE); locationManager.requestLocationUpdates(LocationManager.NETWORK_PROVIDER,5*1000,0, new MyLocaionListener()); Location loco = locationManager.getLastKnownLocation(LocationManager.NETWORK_PROVIDER); Log.d("enabled=" ,"" + locationManager.isProviderEnabled(LocationManager.NETWORK_PROVIDER)); </code></pre>  <p>This code returns a <code>null</code> Location Object, and the logCat shows <code>enabled=false</code> when the location service is disabled <B>although I'm using NETWORK_PROVIDER</B> But when I enable the location service from the phone settings I get <code>enabled=true</code> and I get my current location.<br> So my question is: does network provider also uses the phone GPS? and how do GPS and NETWORK providers internally works.</p>
