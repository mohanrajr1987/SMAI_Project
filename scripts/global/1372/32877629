<p>I have well over 100 runs logged on Strava this year and and I would like to export them all and do something to visualise the data.</p>  <p>Ideally I would like to be able to generate a vector path for each run that I edit and layout in illustrator etc.</p>  <p>Any ideas on the best way to achieve that? I'm not sure where the best place is to start.</p>
