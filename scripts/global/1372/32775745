<p>I have an android application which will track location from background.i am using fused location api with following configuration</p>  <pre><code>    mLocationRequest = new LocationRequest();     mLocationRequest.setSmallestDisplacement(100);     mLocationRequest.setInterval(60*1000);     mLocationRequest.setFastestInterval(60*1000);     mLocationRequest.setPriority(LocationRequest.PRIORITY_HIGH_ACCURACY); </code></pre>  <p>I need location updates only if device moves.Sometimes everything works perfectly.But sometimes i receive location updates even if device in stationary.</p>  <p>Why this issue happens? If i set displacement,do i need to set interval and fastest interval? Is this issue related to google play service version?</p>
