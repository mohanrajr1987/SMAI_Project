<p>I am working on an app in ios8+ in which I have to fetch the location of the user. I am able to fetch the location when I use a CLLocationManager in a screen (viewcontroller). But when I try to fetch the location from the AppDelegate directly, there seems to be some problem and I am not getting any location (the flow is not entering the delegate methods). Can someone help me with this.</p>  <p>This is the code I used :</p>  <pre><code>CLLocationManager *locationManager = [[CLLocationManager alloc] init]; locationManager.delegate = self; locationManager.desiredAccuracy = kCLLocationAccuracyBest; if ([locationManager respondsToSelector:@selector(requestWhenInUseAuthorization)]) {     [locationManager requestWhenInUseAuthorization]; } if ([locationManager respondsToSelector:@selector(requestAlwaysAuthorization)]) {     [locationManager requestAlwaysAuthorization]; } [locationManager startUpdatingLocation]; </code></pre>  <p>Can you help me with this. Thanks</p>
