<p>I am a beginning JS programmer developing in Angular but now I got assigned this task: create a library that accesses phone's GPS module, gyroscope and accelerometer (and possibly a compass) to gather acceleration, position and some other data. It's not a whole lot of code really.Now, creating the library itself in C# is already done by a colleague but I need to know if there' s a way to include objective-C and java code as well into the library which would be the platform specific code for ios/droid respectively.  The result literally has to be a single dll file and it must be useable in xamarin. The requirement even was for the library to work with angular which I have no idea if is even possible. It would be a bonus if it could.  What options do we have in accomplishing this?</p>
