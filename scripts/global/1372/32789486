<p>We have been building an SmartFace app that reports our customer's GPS locations to a central dispatch server. Basically, we have a timer function that runs every 15 seconds and does the following.</p>  <ol> <li>device.SetGPSStatus(true)</li> <li>Send lat/long to our dispatch server.</li> <li>device.SetGPSStatus(false)</li> </ol>  <p>This works perfectly when the app is in the foreground but it fails without throwing an error in the app is minimized.</p>  <p>This leads me to believe that SmartFace is not able to access the GPS unless the  app is in the foreground.</p>  <p>Can anyone confirm if this is the case?</p>  <p>Thanks, Dean</p>
