<p>I want to create portal (WordPress) for kids in my area where they can add images with gps exif showing places of interests.</p>  <p>I'm digging web and I really don't know how to achieve it.</p>  <p>The plan is:</p>  <ul> <li>user submit image (containing gps exif) and brief description,</li> <li>that image should show on google maps with user name and description in place where it was taken and maybe link to somewhat gallery (? large version of image showing below map).</li> </ul>  <p>I know how to make all the steps to submit (I want to create CPT for this) but I don't know how to place it on google maps. Google API isn't helpfull for me with this one.</p>
