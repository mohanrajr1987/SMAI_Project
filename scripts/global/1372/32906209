<p>I'm new in mobile development. I want practice with GPS. I want write server seide on .Net(C#) who can get from mobile gps location. check if it close to second GPS location and to do something.</p>  <p>So I don't know which service is better for GPS locations.  I find this: <a href="http://www.gps-server.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gps-server.net/</a> But I'm not sure if this is what I need, and if Yes - if this is better service??? Thank you, regards, David</p>
