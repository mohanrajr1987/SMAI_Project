<p>I searched but couldn't find anything specific on this.  So far I know those permissions are mentioned in the manifest. Would PackageManager's GET_PERMISSION be useful for this? I'm building an app and this is a requirement so I'd like to know if there is a way to get a list which of the applications which request location. Something like the Settings -> Recent location from apps screen, would that be possible to replicate ?</p>
