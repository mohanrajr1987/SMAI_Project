<p>I am developing an iPhone application. I have used mapkit to show the locations for user to select as source and destination. User also have option to see routes between source and destination. I need to implement the turn by turn navigation. I am using google maps. Is there any other way or any 3rd party library, by which I can implement turn by turn navigation?</p>
