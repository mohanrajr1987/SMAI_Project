<p>I will be mapping longitude and latitude for ibeacons and then using the coordinates from the server and the distance between ibeacons and the device, I know that I can calculate the location of the "user" much faster and more precisely (at least more precise than GPS). However, I don't know what coordinate system to use. Do I use the global longitude and latitude (like the ones used in GPS) or do I create my own local coordination system for the beacons?</p>
