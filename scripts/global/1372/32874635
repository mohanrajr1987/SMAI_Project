<p>For the last two weeks I have been researching the GIS world for a project I have been tasked with. The end goal is to have thousands of GPS points with information bubbles when you click on the point. This was a pretty simple task and now I'm moving onto the next part of this and I need some help to point me in the correct direction for me to research. What I'm trying to accomplish is to have an Alarm go off when I'm within a certain proximity to these points. I know the OpenGEO suite along with QGis has some GPS functions but what I'm looking for is something that can be used by someone either VIA web or a PC or mobile Application that will alarm on proximity. I have also been looking into Leaflet and OpenLayers in hopes I can do it through these map library's or in junction with them. </p>  <p>What are some ways I could do this? Please do not give me any code because I like to research things to learn. I just need some guidance. Thanks in advance!</p>
