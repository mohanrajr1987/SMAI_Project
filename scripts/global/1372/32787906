<p>I'm not a developer, so I appreciate your patience with me as I ask for help. We've hired a dev house to build a native iOS app and have a feature that pulls several address fields from our back-end to place multiple "pins" on an in-app Google maps display. Sometimes it works - sometimes it doesn't - and when it doesn't, it gives the user their current location. The address fields in the database have all been directly copy/pasted from Google Maps online so we know the addresses are formatted exactly as Google recognizes them.</p>  <p>I searched and found this topic which seem to indicate that this should be easily do-able with proper coding: </p>  <p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11318347/geoencode-address-to-gps-coordinates">Geoencode Address to GPS Coordinates</a> (to do with another API)</p>  <p>I also found a few other posts that deal with this issue on Android (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3574644/how-can-i-find-the-latitude-and-longitude-from-address">How can I find the latitude and longitude from address?</a>), and iOS but using addresses from within the app (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16694409/convert-address-to-longitude-and-latitude">Convert address to longitude and latitude</a>).. ours are being pulled from a database.</p>  <p>Our developer has given us a work-around that requires us to manually go in and "place" the pins for every address in our back-office, which is super laborious as we have thousands of entries to correct and no way to know which are not showing correctly until a user tries to access them. </p>  <p>My question is this - shouldn't this be something that can be rectified with proper coding? </p>  <p>If it is possible, is there specific formatting requirements that we're not adhering to? </p>  <p>I'm posting in lieu of the developer because he feels like he's given us a fair method to solve it - however, I would prefer a more universal and less labor intensive solution.</p>  <p>THANKS ALL</p>
