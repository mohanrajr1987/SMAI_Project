<p>I have a HL6548-G and a HL8548-G module with me. I wanted to implement a dialup modem for these modules. I was thinking of using wvdial in linux for this purpose. Anyone else has any suggestions ? Also, I also need the GPS data from the module for which I have to use AT commands in my code. With the modem working as a dial up modem, will sending AT commands to the modem to get GPS data be an issue ?</p>  <p>Also, when I connect the modem to my linux based controller, I see 6 ports (ttyS0,S1 etc). Of these which is the data port, GPS port and which is SMS port ?</p>  <p>Can I use all three (GPS,dialup,SMS) simultaneously ?</p>
