<p>So there is a lot of talk about getting device location. My need is very particular and I am wondering if there is an exact answer.</p>  <ul> <li>I do not want to track users.</li> <li>There is a specific activity in my app that requires location. So when a user go take that specific action, I need to get the location of the device.</li> <li>I need the location acquisition to happen very fast</li> <li>I want FINE location.</li> </ul>  <p>The Android example seems to be about coarse location only <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/location/retrieve-current.html" rel="nofollow">https://developer.android.com/training/location/retrieve-current.html</a></p>  <p>And the answers here seem to be about tracking a user.</p>  <p>For my app, the action in question is not frequent at all (maybe once or twice a week), but when the user wants to use that feature, I need the finest current location.</p>  <p>So is my only solution to track the user?</p>
