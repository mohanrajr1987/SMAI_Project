<p>I'm working on a small piece of front-end functionality and would like to have the best of both worlds. :)</p>  <p>Currently I'm using an input box so that we don't restrict and test values being submitted, however, each of these inputs has a finite range of valid values.<br> It would be nice to have the option of selecting from the valid values OR entering free text.</p>  <p>Does anyone have any experience with this?  I'm hedging my bets towards a jquery library that might swap the inputs out on an icon click but thought it worth asking the community for pro-tips</p>
