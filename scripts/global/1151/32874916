<p>My DB is SQL Server 2012 SP1.</p>  <p>Here is my table:</p>  <pre><code>  DATE            F1          F2        F3 2015-07-1         32           5        78 2015-08-20        18          45        67 2015-09-1         64           9        80 2015-09-30        12          78        45 </code></pre>  <p>Now I would like to count the sum and select only the difference value between last and current month, so in this example selected data should be between August and September, so for example for the field <code>F1</code> it will take the unique value for the August which is 18 then two values from September 64+12=76, then count the difference 76-18, so the value of the <code>F1</code> should be 58.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
