<p>I have a table like this:</p>  <pre><code>   id | id_user | approved     -----------------    1  | 15      | 1    2  | 11      | 1    3  | 15      | 1    4  | 11      | -1    5  | 6       | 1 </code></pre>  <p>I want to select distict values of id_user only if every approved of each id_users is equal to 1. Output:</p>  <pre><code>   id | id_user | approved     -----------------    1  | 15      | 1    2  | 6       | 1 </code></pre>  <p>As you can see, id_user 11 is not selected because one approved value is equal to -1. How can i do this in mysql ?</p>  <p>I've tried <code>SELECT * FROM table WHERE approved != -1 GROUP BY id_user</code> but obviously it does not work so i've decided to ask here this question.</p>  <p>Thank you very much for your time.</p>  <p>//Later edit</p>  <p>I have one more question. I have to modify the query. I have one more table <code>validation</code></p>  <pre><code>id | id_user | valid -------------------- 1  | 15      | 1 </code></pre>  <p>which i have to join with the other table, but with a condition. For example, let's say that your query outputs(correctly):</p>  <pre><code>id | id_user | approved  ----------------- 1  | 15      | 1 2  | 6       | 1 </code></pre>  <p>What i want is to join those 2 tables:</p>  <pre><code>LEFT JOIN (SELECT va.id_user,va.valid FROM validation va WHERE va.valid != 1) t2  ON t2.id_user = t1.id_user </code></pre>  <p>but select only those rows for which valid is NOT equal to 1. It's very possible that <code>id_user</code> from the first table might not exist in the <code>validation</code> table. In this case, the query should return exactly what Alex's query outputs.</p>  <p>Let me give you an example. First table is the same:</p>  <pre><code> id | id_user | approved   -----------------  1  | 15      | 1  2  | 11      | 1  3  | 15      | 1  4  | 11      | -1  5  | 6       | 1  6  | 6       | 1 </code></pre>  <p><code>validation</code> table:</p>  <pre><code> id | id_user | valid  --------------------  1  | 15      | 1 </code></pre>  <p>The query should output:</p>  <pre><code> id | id_user   ------------  1  | 6 </code></pre>  <p>id_user = 15 is in second table with <code>valid=1</code>, so it won't be selected</p>  <p>id_user = 11 has a -1 value in approved field, so it won't be selected</p>  <p>id_user = 6 has 1 in both approved fields, but is not present in second table, i want it to be selected.</p>
