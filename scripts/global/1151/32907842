<p>I am using a join query to get data grouped by titles where titles are stored in another table with user id</p>  <p>so the query is like following</p>  <pre><code>SELECT title, COUNT(title) as cnt FROM users_titles JOIN users ON users_titles.uid = users.uid WHERE users.useractivated = 1 GROUP BY title </code></pre>  <p>Now I wan to add an extra column which will show the percentage of each type like following:</p>  <pre><code>---------------------------------- | title   |   cnt   | percentage | ---------------------------------- | 0       | 23658   | 23.67%     | ---------------------------------- | 1       | 53658   | 43.67%     | ---------------------------------- </code></pre>  <p>some thing like this. How can I achieve this?</p>
