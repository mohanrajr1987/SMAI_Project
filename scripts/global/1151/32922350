<p>Refering to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms189499.aspx" rel="nofollow">here</a> regarding the order of execution of SELECT query, there is an <code>ON</code> mentioned before <code>JOIN</code>. </p>  <pre><code>FROM ON JOIN WHERE GROUP BY WITH CUBE or WITH ROLLUP HAVING SELECT DISTINCT ORDER BY TOP </code></pre>  <p>I tend to think this <code>ON</code> is the <code>ON</code> clause as part of the <code>JOIN</code>.</p>  <ul> <li><p>If it is false, what is this <code>ON</code> ?</p></li> <li><p>If it is true, then it is a bit confusing, because I think when doing a <code>JOIN</code>, SQL Server do a <code>CROSS JOIN</code> before filtering with <code>ON</code>. This may not be strictly correct as SQL server has some mechanism to optimize this process, something regarding chosing one smaller table as inner table to loop the outer table as I remember correctly for the <code>ON</code> condition. Then in this case, wouldn't <code>JOIN</code> be before <code>ON</code> in execution order ?</p></li> </ul>  <p>Could you shed some light on what I mention ?</p>
