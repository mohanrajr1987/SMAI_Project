<p>I am trying to find out how to remove a specific character from the list of word-breakers used in full-text searching (English-US).  The hyphen is the character causing me problems.  When I search for ABC-DEF, SQL returns records containing ABC or DEF.  I need this to return only those records that contain the full ABC-DEF words.</p>  <p>Can I remove word-breaker characters from the list of word-breakers?  If not, is there a specific way to write this query to return only those records that contain the whole (hyphenated) word? Or, is there a configuration parameter I can change?</p>
