<p>Sorry if this seems like a dumb question but I'm reading about SQL injection and one of the mentioned instances of the such state that a SQL command such as </p>  <pre><code>SELECT *  FROM Users  WHERE Name ="" or ""=""  AND Pass ="" or ""="" </code></pre>  <p>would be valid and return all records of the table users. I understand the logic behind doing something like</p>  <pre><code>SELECT *  FROM Users  WHERE UserId = 105 or 1=1 </code></pre>  <p>but I can't seem to figure out why <code>""=""</code> would be a true statement. I'm quite new to SQL in general and I've searched for an answer but most examples of SQL injection only mention the 1=1 example.</p>
