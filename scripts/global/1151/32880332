<p>I am trying to perform a MySql select with many conditions, but want to perform a string comparison on a column that is an integer datatype. Is there a way to do this without having to cast the column to a varchar on every single condition within the where clause?</p>  <pre><code>SELECT COUNT(*)  FROM tablename  WHERE CAST(col1 AS VARCHAR(10)) NOT LIKE '558%'    AND CAST(col1 AS VARCHAR(10)) NOT LIKE '566%'    AND CAST(col1 AS VARCHAR(10)) NOT LIKE '567%'   AND CAST(col1 AS VARCHAR(10)) NOT LIKE '568%'   AND CAST(col1 AS VARCHAR(10)) NOT LIKE '569%'   AND CAST(col1 AS VARCHAR(10)) NOT LIKE '579%'; </code></pre>  <p>Before you ask why I'm not doing integer comparison: Instead of casting to a varchar, I could also just use plain integer comparison, but then I still would have to perform a math operation, i.e. col1/100000, for every item in the where clause, which leads to the same problem as to how can I simplify the statement?</p>
