<p>Using the table from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32920883/r-obtaining-subset-of-a-column-that-matches-a-certain-criteria/32921034#32921034">this post</a>, I noticed that my data gives different results if I execute <code>student_data$height == c("short", "very tall")</code>, versus <code>student_data$height%in% c("short", "very tall")</code>.</p>  <p>Why is that? And which one will give me students that are either "short" or "very tall"?</p>
