<p>I have huge trouble combining the three select statements, i have tried union it does not work, as separate select statements they do work however i need the rest to be one swift statement, if possible even putting the final records in a random order</p>  <pre><code>      SELECT DISTINCT email        FROM customer_1_tbl       WHERE email NOT IN (SELECT temp.email                            FROM temp_emails AS temp)          AND substring_index(email, '@', -1) = 'seznam.cz'       ORDER BY RAND()        LIMIT 6        UNION        SELECT DISTINCT email        FROM customer_1_tbl       WHERE email  NOT IN (SELECT temp.email                             FROM temp_emails AS temp)             AND substring_index(email, '@', -1) = 'gmail.com'       ORDER BY RAND()        LIMIT 6        UNION         SELECT DISTINCT email        FROM customer_1_tbl       WHERE email NOT IN (SELECT temp.email                            FROM temp_emails AS temp)          AND substring_index(email, '@', -1) != 'gmail.com'         AND substring_index(email, '@', -1) != 'seznam.cz'         AND RAND() &lt; (SELECT ((6/COUNT(*))*10)                        FROM customer_1_tbl)       ORDER BY RAND()        LIMIT 6 </code></pre>
