<p>I have written code like below</p>  <pre><code> &lt;select ng-model="selectedseasId" ng-options="seas.seasInternalId as seas.seasName for seas in seass track by seas.seasInternalId"&gt; &lt;/select&gt;  $scope.selectedseasId = 3; </code></pre>  <p>I have data like </p>  <pre><code>var seass = [   {         "seasInternalId" : 4,        "seasName": "My Second seas"         },          {         "seasInternalId" : 3,        "seasName": "My Second seas"         }       ]; </code></pre>  <p>No value is getting selected in select box. Is there anything wrong with my code?</p>
