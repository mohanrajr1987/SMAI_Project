<p>I am doing aggregation on QTY field which will have either 0 or positive value. So presence of any positive number can predict sum will be greater than 0. Is there any way to return true once a positive value found rather than doing summation of all rows ? It is DB2 database.</p>  <pre><code> select *     from a     where a_id in (1,2,3,4)     and     (       flag = 'Y'        or        (select sum(qty) from b where b.a_id = a.a_id) &gt; 0     ) </code></pre>
