<p>I have the following query:</p>  <pre><code>select count(*) as `count`, ass.date_assigned as date_assigned from `buyers` as b left join `assignments` as ass on (ass.id_buyer = b.id) </code></pre>  <p>I only want this to count the total <code>buyers</code>. The problem is it appears to be counting all of the <code>assignments</code> as well.</p>  <p>I've tried grouping by <code>b.id</code> and <code>ass.id_buyer</code>, I've tried changing <code>count(*)</code> to <code>count(b.id)</code>.</p>  <p>Nothing works. How do I fix this so it only counts the <code>buyers</code>?</p>
