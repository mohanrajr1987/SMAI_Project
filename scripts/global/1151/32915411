<p>I'm optimizing the queries against MySQL and my slow queries log shows me that the WordPress plugin "Better WordPress Recent Comments" Widget that shows the last 5 recent comments grouped by posts, uses 1.26 seconds to query the db which is a long time for a website - especially when the next website is just a click away.</p>  <p><strong>Here is the slow query:</strong></p>  <h1>Query_time: 1.265625 Lock_time: 0.000000 Rows_sent: 6 Rows_examined: 288634</h1>  <p>SET timestamp=1443741678;</p>  <pre><code>SELECT wpcoms.* FROM ( SELECT *, @num := if(@post_id = comment_post_ID, @num + 1, 1) as row_number, @post_id := comment_post_ID as cpID FROM wp_comments WHERE comment_approved = 1 ORDER BY comment_post_ID DESC, comment_ID DESC ) as wpcoms WHERE wpcoms.row_number &lt;= 2 ORDER BY wpcoms.comment_date DESC LIMIT 6; </code></pre>  <p>Rows examined says 288.634, but my database consists of only 96.000 comments. That surely should be possible to improve so that just a few comments actually is examined in a very short time instead, as there is only the few recent posted comments it shows. Thanks.</p>
