<p>I am developing an application that needs an embedded database, so I designed it using MYSQL, and created a SQL Statement that works in there. However, when moving to the Embedded Database (Which is Hyper-SQL (HSQLDB)) my query is not working anymore. It seems to be related to the quantity of parameters that I have on the select that must match the Group By, but if I go and add them it'll keep the data ungrouped and that doesn't work for me.</p>  <p>Here is the Query:</p>  <p>I have two tables (GFS and SUPP) with the same columns, the difference is on the behavior and that one has more populated columns that the other one.</p>  <pre><code>SELECT gfs.GFSAccount, gfs.GLAccount,        CASE           WHEN gfs.ICPartner = "" THEN '[ICP_NONE]'          WHEN gfs.ICPartner &lt;&gt; "" THEN gfs.ICPartner        END AS ICPartner,        CASE           WHEN gfs.PPESupplementalData &lt;&gt; '' THEN gfs.PPESupplementalData          WHEN gfs.PPESupplementalData = '' THEN '[NONE]'        END AS SupplementalData,        CASE           WHEN gfs.AccountType = 'SALES AND COS' THEN gfs.PCode          WHEN gfs.AccountType = 'COO' THEN 'COO'          WHEN gfs.AccountType = 'OTHERS' THEN gfs.Business        END AS Business,        Round(Sum(gfs.Amount), 2) AS Amount FROM gfs, supp WHERE gfs.GLAccount &lt;&gt; supp.GLAccount GROUP BY gfs.GFSAccount,          CASE WHEN gfs.ICPartnerSplit = 1 THEN gfs.ICPartner END  UNION  SELECT GFSAccount, GLAccount,        CASE           WHEN ICPartner = "" THEN '[ICP_NONE]'          WHEN ICPartner &lt;&gt; "" THEN ICPartner        END AS ICPartner,        CASE           WHEN SuppData &lt;&gt; '' THEN SuppData          WHEN SuppData = '' THEN '[NONE]'        END AS SupplementalData,        Business, Round(Sum(Amount), 2) AS Amount FROM supp  ORDER BY GFSAccount; </code></pre>  <p>There're a lot of conversions for blank and fixed fields, but the main issue is with the 3 group by (2 within every select, and one in the very end), that it's not allowing me to do it.</p>  <p>(I know that the query itself isn't the best created or optimized, but I've been out from databases for a while and I'm kind of rusty)</p>  <p>Is there any suggestions you guys can do to me in order to make it work in HSQLDB (Or another database that is not MySQL)??</p>
