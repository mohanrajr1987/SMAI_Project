<p>I have a column's field filled with all kinds of data from a user request (one request per row).</p>  <p>I only need the email addresses from these users' requests, and they are all placed in this column according to the following format:</p>  <pre><code>[...data...] Email: mysql@se.com Phone: [...remaining data...] </code></pre>  <p>I have found this question:</p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10551051/select-part-of-table-column-data-in-mysql">select part of table column data in mysql</a></p>  <p>Which provides a solution for part of the problem: </p>  <pre><code>SELECT SUBSTR(message,INSTR(message,'Email: ')+7) FROM user_req_log </code></pre>  <p>However, this will return all the unwanted remaining data.</p>  <p>What's the most efficient way to confine the results to the strings I need (email addresses) and, at the same time, ignore duplicates?</p>
