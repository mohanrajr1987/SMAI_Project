<p>Let's say I have a table of data of all the students in a school. I want to look at family size of students who are male (1) and are at least considered "tall". How would I do this in R?</p>  <p>I only can seem to figure out how to get the column of family size of students, which would be <code>student_data$family_size</code>, but I can't figure out how to narrow it down any further.</p>  <pre><code>   family_size  ...  gender ... height 1       6              1         very tall 2       3              0         tall 3       5              1         tall 4       4              1         tall 5      10              0         very short 6       2              1         average </code></pre>  <p>So I would want:</p>  <pre><code>     family_size 1       6 2       5 3       4 </code></pre>  <p>I'm not sure how the indexing would turn out, maybe it corresponds to the original indexing of the first table, but that's not as important.</p>  <p>Also, I'm not sure if what I've uploaded is a data frame or not, when I execute <code>typeof(student_data)</code>, it returns <code>"list"</code></p>
