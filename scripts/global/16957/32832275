<p>This seemingly simple problem has me stopped dead in my tracks for three days now. </p>  <p>My code:</p>  <pre><code>Dim rs As DAO.Recordset  Set rs = CurrentDb.OpenRecordset("qryAutoOrder", dbOpenDynaset) </code></pre>  <p>qryAutoOrder is a select query which runs just fine by itself and has no parameters (unless criteria in the query builder count).</p>  <p>When the code runs it hangs on the <code>set rs =</code> line and throws this error.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Run-time error '3061': Too few parameters. Expected 1.</p> </blockquote>  <p>There is more to the code where I would like it to run a loop for each record in the query results so that I can append data to another existing databases tables but it is currently commented out.</p>
