<p>I have a table that stores project names and their associated RGB colours.</p>  <p>In my order form I select project name from a dropdown and the RGB colour gets displayed in a control.</p>  <p>I was wondering how I could get a shape in my form to change colour based on the RGB displayed in the control.</p>  <p>I was thinking of using vba to set the shape <code>Me.Shape.Backcolor = val(RGB_Colour)</code></p>  <p>Shape is the name of my shape I want to colour <code>RGB_Colour</code> is the control that contains the RGB in this text format (e.g: <code>RGB(41, 201, 255)</code>)</p>  <p>Thank a lot for your help</p>
