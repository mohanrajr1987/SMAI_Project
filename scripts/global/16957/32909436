<p>Got a weird one here.  On newly created forms, I am having an issue with input fields placed in the Form Header.  These "Unbound" fields are generally used for searching/filtering the form and I am having issues with both text boxes and combo boxes.  The fields locked setting is set to No and the enabled setting is set to Yes.  The Form's Data Entry, Additions, Edits, Filters is set to Yes and Deletions is set to No.</p>  <p>On form load, when a user attempts to type into the search field nothing happens.  No errors are reported at the bottom of Access.  The weird part is if I go into design mode, then back to view mode, the field works as designed.  The forms query looks at this field to filter the form out, so I am wondering if the query is locking this filed out when the form is loaded.</p>  <p>Any ideas?</p>  <p>Thanks, </p>
