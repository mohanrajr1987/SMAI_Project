<p>I have a form TimeCardSplit that is a split form. I would like to be able to search its record source, EmployeeWorkLog for records based on specific fields to populate the form for corrections. </p>  <p>I have two comboboxes, a textbox and a listbox I would like to use to filter my results.They are cboSearchEmployee, cboSearchJob, tboSearchDate and lstSearch. I would like to have the lstSearch show all the records in EmployeeWorkLog and be able to filter it down by using cboSearchEmployee, cboSearchJob and tboSearchDate. Once the records have been filtered down enough I like to then be able to double click on them in lstSearch and bring them up in the form TimeCardSplit. </p>  <p>I appreciate any advice that can be given. </p>  <p>Thanks for looking. </p>  <p>I have done more searching and have decided to move to a subform rather than using a splitform. I discovered I can filter the subform with the following code.</p>  <pre><code>Private Sub cboSearchJob_AfterUpdate()  If IsNull(Me.cboSearchJob) Then     Me.cldTimeCard.Form.Filter = ""     Me.cldTimeCard.Form.FilterOn = False Else     Me.cldTimeCard.Form.Filter = "[JobID]=" &amp; Me.cboSearchJob     Me.cldTimeCard.Form.FilterOn = True End If  Exit Sub   End Sub </code></pre>  <p>Now I'm trying to find a function to double click on a row once filtered to bring it into the form. Currently I'm using...</p>  <pre><code>Private Sub cboJob_DblClick(Cancel As Integer)     DoCmd.OpenForm "Try", , , "[JobID] = " &amp; Me!JobID End Sub </code></pre>  <p>This is of course only in the one combobox in my subform. although this works it will only bring the first instance of my filtering results into the form, not the specific row I double click on.</p>  <p>So here is my new question. Is there a better place to put this code or similar code to populate the form with the row I'm double clicking on? </p>  <p>Thanks again for looking. </p>
