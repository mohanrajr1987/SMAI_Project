<p>I have this code, running with Access 2013 VBA. Basically, it checks for a Destination Directory <code>Dest</code> and if it doesn't exists, creates the directory and deletes all previous files within the Old Folder <code>OldDest</code> having the name "laydb" and any extension file.</p>  <pre><code>If Len(Dir(Dest)) = 0 Then     MkDir Dest     Kill OldDest &amp; "laydb.*" End If </code></pre>  <p>Now, it works fine on Windows 7, but in Windows 8.1 doesn't.</p>  <p>Any help?</p>
