<p>I am having a hard time on this equation in MS access. I am working on a report design.</p>  <p>=IIf([Field1]="Yes","ïƒ¼"," ") Is it wrong?</p>  <p>I tried removing ="Yes" from the equation to see if will work and yes it works but if I return this ="Yes" in the equation I always get this error #Type!</p>  <p>It should check Field1 is equal to Yes then if true it will display a character then if not it will display nothing</p>  <p>I posted this before they said that I am comparing ="Yes" against a string. But how to correct the error? What should I do? What should I type? Or where can I find possible solution.</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
