<p>I'm having trouble with writing VBA code to make sure fields are used in an Access form I'm working on. What I'd like to have happen is if certain fields are not used there would be a MsgBox that pops up when the saved command is used. In addition for if EquipmentID is used I would like tboEquipmentTime to be used. </p>  <p>Here are my problems with the code I'm using. My code does not work for EmployeeID and ServiceID. It skips over them even when those fields are left empty. </p>  <p>My other problem is that my validation for tboEquipmentTime will bring up the MsgBox regardless if EquipmentID is used or not. </p>  <p>I have already posted this question <a href="http://www.dbforums.com/showthread.php?1707242-Ensure-TB-is-used-if-CB-is-not-null&amp;p=6638061#post6638061/%22here%22" rel="nofollow">here</a> and thought I figured it out, but I was wrong. Please let me know if there's a good way to get this to work.  </p>  <p>Here is the code I'm currently using. </p>  <pre><code> Private Sub cmdSave_Click()    If IsNull(Me.JobID) Then         MsgBox "Please Enter Job Name", vbOKOnly Or vbExclamation, "JOB NAME"         Me.cboJob.SetFocus    Exit Sub     End If    If IsNull(Me.EmployeeID) Then         MsgBox "Please Enter Employee Name", vbOKOnly Or vbExclamation, "EMPLOYEE NAME"         Me.cboEmployee.SetFocus    Exit Sub     End If    If IsNull(Me.tboDate) Then         MsgBox "Please Enter Date", vbOKOnly Or vbExclamation, "Date"         Me.tboDate.SetFocus    Exit Sub     End If    If IsNull(Me.ServiceID) Then         MsgBox "Please Enter Service Type", vbOKOnly Or vbExclamation, "SERVICE"         Me.cboEmployee.SetFocus    Exit Sub     End If      If (IsNull(Me.EquipmentID)) Or (Me.tboEquipmentTime = "") Then          Else         If (IsNull(Me.tboEquipmentTime)) Or (Me.tboEquipmentTime = "") Then           MsgBox "Please Enter Time For " &amp; (DLookup("[Model]", "Equipment", "ID=" &amp; [cboEquipment])) &amp; " ", vbOKOnly Or vbExclamation, "Enter Equipment Time"           Me.tboEquipmentTime.SetFocus     Exit Sub      End If        End If         MsgBox "Record for " &amp; Me.tboFormTitle.Value &amp; " has been added", vbOKOnly Or vbInformation, "Saved"     Call Save         Me.cboJob.SetFocus End Sub </code></pre>  <p>Thank you for taking a look. </p>
