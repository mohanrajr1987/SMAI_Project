<p>In Access 2013 64-bit, I have a form for a table with a foreign key to another table which stores the lookup value as an int. On this particular form I'd like to display the lookup as a string value, a particular field from the foreign key relationship.</p>  <p>How do I set the control source to display the value?</p>  <p>E.g. I'd like the query to be:     SELECT car.[title] FROM cars where cars.[id] = car_id</p>  <p>where car_id is the field with the relationship.</p>
