<p>In Access 2013 (64-bit) I'm opening another database (db2) when the user clicks a button on a form in db1. This is working. However, when it opens db2 I get the warning bar "Security warning: Some active content has been disabled. Click for more details" with a button to enable the content. This is annoying and when I open the database from db1 with forms also opened, when I click the button to enable the content all currently open forms are closed.</p>  <p>Both databases are in the same directory, and I have added this directory to the trusted locations. Is there something else I need to do to disable this warning bar without automatically trusting all databases (something I don't want to do)?</p>  <p>When I manually open each database, I don't see the warning bar appear, so I assume it's something to do with the VBA code I'm using:</p>  <pre><code>Dim db2 As Variant Set db2 = CreateObject("Access.Application") db2.OpenCurrentDatabase "NewDb.accdb"     db2.DoCmd.OpenForm "_View" db2.DoCmd.OpenForm "_Home" db2.UserControl = True </code></pre>
