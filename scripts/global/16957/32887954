<p>I have assigned this code to a command button on my form to mail records using my MS Outlook email system. </p>  <blockquote>   <p><code>DoCmd.SendObject acSendForm, "frmSearch_Results", acFormatPDF</code></p> </blockquote>  <p>What is happening is that, this code sends all records/pages on my form. Is there any way I could only send records for specific page numbers, say the first, second or current page on my form? I know I could restrict my selection based on certain criteria, but in this case, the only criteria I want to set is to send <strong>my current page</strong> of form as the PDF. Any suggestions? Thank you in advance. </p>
