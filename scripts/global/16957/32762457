<p>I am converting an excel spreadsheet over to an Access database.  I am new to Access, though I have taken a couple of courses through a local training company.  In the spreadsheet that I am converting, we currently use a "tracking" number that identifies each main record (which would be in my new main table) that is in the format of "YY-XXXX" where "YY" is the current 2-digit year and "XXXX" is a sequence number that begins at 0001 and could go up to 9999 each year.  So, the last record of 2014 might have been 14-1025, and the first record of 2015 is 15-0001.</p>  <p>For consistency sake with my old data, I would like to use the same numbering system.  I know I can generate a standard autonumber as the primary key (and I may do that as well anyway, but I want to have this YY-XXXX field automatically sequence when I create a new record in a form.  So, how might you recommend an approach to do this?  </p>  <p>My first thought is to create and merge two strings, one that converts the current date to a two digit text field and the other an autonumber for the sequence?  I have played around with this and haven't been able to get anything to work.  I am not too good at VBA code, so it has all been just trying to create tables, fields and expressions.  But maybe VBA is the only way to do it.</p>  <p>While I don't know how to do this, one acceptable option might include using an autonumber that is six digits long and is just formatted with a dash after the first two digits, along with a way to easily restart the numbering, i.e. on Jan 1 of next year, set the autonumber to 160001 (formatted as 16-0001). </p>  <p>Any great ideas out there? </p>
