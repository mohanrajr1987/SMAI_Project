<p>I am trying to, in Microsoft Access 2013, create a real-time link to data provided by a REST-based API (<a href="http://portfoliomanager.energystar.gov/webservices/home/api" rel="nofollow">this API, to be specific</a>). The ultimate goal is for the data to be available in a query as if it were a local database.</p>  <p>How can this be accomplished? Specifically, I am struggling with how to have Access call the API upon request. The only way I can think to achieve a similar result is to write a script that pulls the entire database via the API and translates it to an Access-readable format, then run that script at set intervals. But I'd really like to find a solution that works in real time, even if it's a skosh slower than locally caching the database.</p>
