<p>I'm trying to make a user authentication system for my access database. currently I have a form which has two combo boxes "Username" and "Password"  and a button used to authenticate entered data. I also have a table named "Login" which houses all of the usernames and passwords and also their "Level" which is their clearance level which will determine which version of a form opens as well as other information. I am not proficient at Dlookup and I am getting an error "Invalid outside procedure" Can I not pass the dlookup value as a string that can be used in an if statement?</p>  <p>CODE:</p>  <pre class="lang-vb prettyprint-override"><code>Public Sub Command4_Click()     Dim usr As String     Dim lvl As String     Dim lck As Integer      usr = DLookup("Password", "Login", "Me.Username.Value= 'Username'")     lvl = DLookup("Level", "Login", "Me.Username.Value= 'Username'")      If usr = Me.Password.Value Then lck = 1      Do While lck = 1         If lvl = 3 Then             DoCmd.OpenForm "Main"             lck = 0         End If     Loop End Sub </code></pre>
