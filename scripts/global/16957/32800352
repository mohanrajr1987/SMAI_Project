<p>I am working on an Access DB, which have ODBC linked SQL Server table and local table, and I have following tsql script (as VB script) in Access DB. I am wondering if the tsql query can be made up of one linked table and one local Access table, instead of all are from linked tables. I know SQL Server does not know anything about my local data, but I just wonder if this coding can work or not. If yes, how should the following codes be modified? If no, that means I need to move the local table to SQL Server first? Appreciate if someone can advise. Thanks a lot. </p>  <p>The following section tries to update linked table from local table. </p>  <pre><code>qryd.SQL = " UPDATE dbo.linked_table  SET dbo.linked_table.field = '" &amp; [local_access_table]![access_field] &amp; "'  FROM dbo.linked_table  INNER JOIN " &amp; [local_access_table] &amp; "  ON ( '" &amp; [local_access_table]![access_field] &amp; "' = dbo.linked_table.field )  WHERE dbo.linked_table.field = 'value' " </code></pre>  <p>OR vice versa, this section below tries to update local table from linked table. </p>  <pre><code>qryd.SQL = " UPDATE " &amp; [local_access_table] &amp; " SET '" &amp; [local_access_table]![access_field] &amp; "' = dbo.linked_table.field FROM " &amp; [local_access_table] &amp; " INNER JOIN dbo.linked_table ON ( dbo.linked_table.field = '" &amp; [local_access_table]![access_field] &amp; "' )  WHERE '" &amp; [local_access_table]![access_field] &amp; "' = 'value' " </code></pre>  <p>Maybe my mindset is too much affected by Access, so I have other similar question. In Access, a select query(created in local Access) can be easily included in other Access query, I am wondering if this concept can be applied to tsql query? Take this as an example.</p>  <pre><code>qryd.SQL = " UPDATE dbo.linked_table  SET dbo.linked_table.field = '" &amp; [local_access_query]![query_field] &amp; "'  FROM dbo.linked_table  INNER JOIN " &amp; [local_access_query] &amp; "  ON ( '" &amp; [local_access_query]![query_field] &amp; "' = dbo.linked_table.field )  WHERE dbo.linked_table.field = 'value' " </code></pre>  <p>Thanks a lot!</p>
