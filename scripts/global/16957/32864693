<p>Has anyone got a better way to do this? I want the users to be able to filter to a set of records, and then use a sql statement to do something to just the filtered records.</p>  <p>My code at the moment looks something like the following, and it works.  But I do wonder if there is any better (or other?) way to achieve this that could avoid the clunky Replace statement? I wondered if I could do it using a recordset instead, but unless I'm missing something, there's no way to do set operations over a recordset, I'd have to loop through the records individually to do that. </p>  <p>Any other suggestions?</p>  <pre><code>Dim db As Database Dim frm As Form Dim sqlCmd As String Dim filter As String  Set db = CurrentDb Set frm = Forms("frmReplen").Controls("FrmReplenSheet").Form filter = Replace(frm.filter, "[FrmReplenSheet].", "")  sqlCmd = "UPDATE tblRCmDataSheetExtract " &amp; _     "SET Completed = 1 " &amp; _     "WHERE " &amp; filter  db.Execute sqlCmd </code></pre>
