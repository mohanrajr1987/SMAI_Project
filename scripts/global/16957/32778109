<p>I have created one small databse access in this form I create Attachment field but when I attach any file in attachment field then my database size gets increased. My concern is file should not save on access databse (Including in databse).</p>  <p>So I need When I attach any file (.pdf,.xls,.doc ...etc) then it should save on Local drive, So whenever I open file through access database 2013 then it should open from my local drive.</p>
