<p>I've a report with multiple sites where each row in the database is a page.<br> I've set a macro to print open the report in the print view and added a function<br> on opening of said report. The idea was to update a value in each row on printing the whole report.<br> My method:  </p>  <pre><code>Private Sub Dummy_Print(Cancel As Integer, PrintCount As Integer)     Dim SQL As String      SQL = "UPDATE dummy" &amp; _           "SET dummy.printed = TRUE, dummy.printed_at = Now()" &amp; _           "WHERE dummy.printed = FALSE AND dummy.id = " &amp; Me.dummy_id      DoCmd.RunSQL SQL    End Sub </code></pre>  <p>But this code is never executing.<br> Am I referencing each dummy_id wrong or is the syntax wrong? </p>
