<p>I am trying to create an Access Form that links one combobox to another so that the selection made in one combobox determines the next comboboxes' dropdowns. Here is the code I have:</p>  <pre><code>Private Sub Combo58_AfterUpdate()  With Forms("UserForm").Combo60     If IsNull(Forms("UserForm").Combo58) Then         .RowSource = ""     Else         .RowSource = "SELECT DISTINCT [BusinessLvl2(Unit)Code] " &amp; _                      "FROM HRBI " &amp; _                      "WHERE [BusinessLvl1(Group)Code]=[Forms]![UserForm]![Combo58];"     End If     Call .Requery End With </code></pre>  <p>End Sub</p>  <p>My code works successfully when there are less than 16 drop down selections. After that, I receive the error message "System Resources Exceeded". I assume I am hitting Access limitations, however this seems like a really simple task to try and accomplish. Does anyone have any ideas on what I am doing wrong and a workaround?</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
