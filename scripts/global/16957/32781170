<p>I am creating an application in MS-ACCESS 2007 in which I have created a table which holds personal information of students and similarly a form which accepts data from the user and on the click of submit button, inserts the data in the table. Now I want to display 14 out of those 18 columns of my table on the form(in the table like format) when the user clicks on display button. I got some videos on displaying data using DataGridView but I could not find this widget. Is there any other method to do it? </p>
