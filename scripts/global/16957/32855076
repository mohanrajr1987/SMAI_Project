<p>I have an access db that pulls volumes from a table of exceptions.  Each volume has an ID.  I've created queries to pull details, for all possible volumes, and saved each one with the same name as each volume ID.  Each time the volume exceptions are pulled into this db, the volume IDs can change. So, there is a query that runs that updates the volume table with the new IDs.</p>  <p>Unless you know a way to do this with a query, I need to write Access VBA code that will loop through the volume table, identify the name of each query and then run those queries until it reaches the end of the table. For example, the code needs to look at the first record in the volume table, say it is 1040.  This is the name of the query that needs to run. The code then needs to find the query named 1040 and run it.  It is a make table query.   </p>  <p>The table name is FacilityVolume and it has one field named Volume.  The value in the field is shorttext format even though it is numeric.    </p>  <p>I've tried a couple of different things.  Here is my latest try.  </p>  <pre><code>    Dim db as Database     Dim vol as Recordset     Dim code as QueryDef      Set db = CurrentDb()     Set vol = db.OpenRecordset("FacilityVolume")     Set Volume = vol.Fields("Volume")      Vol.MoveFirst     Do Until vol.EOF = True         If QueryDef.Name = Volume Then            DoCmd.OpenQuery         Else MsgBox("The query does not exist")         vol.MoveNext     Loop     End Sub </code></pre>  <p>I've searched the internet for a few days and can't find any reference to this particular code.  I'm sure other users would like to know how to do this.  I'm a novice and still learning VBA so any help you can provide is greatly appreciated.</p>
