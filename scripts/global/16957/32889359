<p>I am receiving the 3075 error (invalid operator) from the script below. The VBA error is marking the set statement in yellow. I don't understand why. What is lacking? </p>  <pre><code>strSql = "SELECT FA_AVG.RadNr, (Left([Text],122)) AS LetaEfter1, Mid([Text],130,18) AS LetaEfter2, Right(Left([Text],184),36) AS LetaEfter3, FA_AVG.PerNr, FA_AVG.Fil, FA_AVG.GR1 " &amp; _ "FROM FA_AVG " &amp; _ "WHERE (((FA_AVG.RadNr)=20) AND ((Left([Text],122))='" &amp; strTemp1 &amp; "') AND ((Right(Left([Text],184),36))='" &amp; strTemp3 &amp; "') AND (Trim(FA_AVG.PerNr)='" &amp; strPer &amp; "'))"  Set rstAddData = CurrentDb.OpenRecordset(strSql) </code></pre>
