<p>I have tried several different ways of searching for this information with no luck so far...</p>  <p>Firstly, I am using Access 2013, and I wouldn't exactly call myself experienced with it...</p>  <p>I have a table with many fields and I want to be able to create a report dynamically that only uses a subset of those fields. The subset is to be determined by a ListBox (with multi select turned on) containing the list of all of the fields.</p>  <p>So, a user will:</p>  <ol> <li>Opens the filtering form that was created</li> <li>Selects the fields they wish to view</li> <li>Clicks "Generate Report"</li> <li>The report will only shown the fields that were asked for</li> </ol>  <p>Is this possible? If so, how?</p>
