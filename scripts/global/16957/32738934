<p>I am trying to get a list of the tables and fields that are used to produce queries in an access database. I am able to identify the fields found in a query output but not the fields used to design the query.</p>  <p>In other words, is it possible to obtain the table and field names specified in the query builder section of the design view of a query in Access?</p>  <p>I have found and developed upon some VBA code that gets all of the fields that are in the output of a query (below) but this does not get the info I need. Is it possible to achieve what I am looking for?</p>  <pre><code>Function listQueryFields() As String      Dim db As DAO.Database     Dim qry As DAO.QueryDef     Dim fld As Field     Dim rs As Recordset      Set db = CurrentDb()     Set rs = db.OpenRecordset("tbl_Query_Field_Names")      For Each qry In db.QueryDefs         If InStr(1, qry.Name, "_qry_", vbTextCompare) &gt; 0 Then             Debug.Print qry.Name                 For Each fld In qry.Fields                    Debug.Print fld.Name                    rs.AddNew                         rs(0) = qry.Name                         rs(1) = fld.Name                     rs.Update                  Next          End If     Next      Set db = Nothing     Set rs = Nothing     Exit Function  End Function </code></pre>
