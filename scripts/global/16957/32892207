<p>How can I cascade methods for a custom class?</p>  <p>What I am working on is a custom class to work with dates.</p>  <p>I feed the class a date as a property. Then I would like to return the date based on the method associated. For example:</p>  <pre><code>InputDate.AdjustToFirst </code></pre>  <p>So if I input 5/15/2015 the above would return 5/1/2015.</p>  <p>Likewise could I do:</p>  <pre><code>InputDate.AdjustToFirst.ReduceOneYear </code></pre>  <p>so if input 5/15/2015 the return would be 5/1/2014.</p>  <p>Further</p>  <pre><code>InputDate.ReduceOneYear </code></pre>  <p>5/15/2015 would return 5/15/2014.</p>  <p>I know about DateSerial, I am just trying to learn how to do the above. The idea is similar to VBs <code>variable.ToString</code> method.</p>
