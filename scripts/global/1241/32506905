<p>Here's the deal, it's just an annoyance, but I'd rather not have to put up with annoyances.</p>  <p>Javascript is disabled in the reader, but every time I open a PDF with JS, I get that nasty, really unnecessary, warning at the top of the document.</p>  <p>I know it's merely telling me that the document may not be fully "functional" with the JS disabled, but I don't care, if someone can't write a document that gracefully fails with JS disabled, then it's not a document worth reading.</p>  <p>So, is there a means to globally dismiss or remove the warning that appears at the top of the document when I open a PDF with JS?</p>
