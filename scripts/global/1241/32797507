<p>I have an Illustrator file that I created and I made a change to a gradient and then saved the file. When I tried to reopen the file I got the error message listed below:</p>  <p>Offending operator:  Bg  Context:</p>  <p>-293.6436 3.81445 -303.502 -12.5605 -314.9639 -24.0186 c</p>  <p>Bb</p>  <p>1 (Unnamed gradient 2) 0 0 90 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 Bg</p>  <p>Is there a way to repair this file by editing the PostScript code?  This is a logo file that I spent quite a few hours on and I would hate to have to recreate it from scratch.  Unfortunately, the project is due in a couple of weeks.  If I need to start over from scratch I would like to know right away, please.  Thanks.</p>
