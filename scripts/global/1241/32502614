<p>I'm developing an app in Adobe AIR for Android and I had come across the need of running another swf with code in new Activity.</p>  <p>So according to my understanding how Adobe AIR works for Android is that in APK main launcher activity boots up, holds and controls developed app, which in AIR comes in form of swf. </p>  <p>Is it possible open another activity and run another swf inside it?</p>  <p>What I have tried is </p>  <p>AS3</p>  <pre><code>package { public class DoubleActivity extends Sprite {     public function DoubleActivity()     {         stage.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, onMouseClick);     }      protected function onMouseClick(event:MouseEvent):void     {         NativeExt.instance.openActivityWithSwf();     } } } </code></pre>  <p>Java Activity is just blank</p>  <pre><code>package   import android.app.Activity; import android.os.Bundle; import android.util.Log;   public class SwfActivity extends Activity {  private String debugTag = "DoubleActivity";  @Override protected void onCreate(Bundle pSavedInstanceState) {     super.onCreate(pSavedInstanceState);     Log.v(debugTag , "onCreate"); } } </code></pre>
