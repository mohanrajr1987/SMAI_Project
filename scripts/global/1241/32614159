<p>I am developing a native extension for iOS and Android for Adobe AIR. I want to generate a single file .ane, but I wish I could call my native extension with multiple contexts.</p>  <p>Android is easy, just asked to test the context parameter in the function of public FREContext CreateContext (String pExtensionName) ', and return an instance in context as a parameter.</p>  <p>But how can I do that iOS?</p>
