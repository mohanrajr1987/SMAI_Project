<p>I am making a Website in Adobe Muse CC 2015 and I have added some anchor links to go to a part of a page however when I click on the link it scrolls to the desired point but what I want is that when I click on the link it should jump to that point instead of scrolling. How can I accomplish this in Muse or in HTML? Thanks in Advance</p>
