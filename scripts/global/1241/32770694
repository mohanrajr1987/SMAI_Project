<p>I am looking for a way to use js/jsx scripts, that work in Adobe Illustrator in an automated mode. Bridge script LiveTrace enables me to batch trace images. Can I implement other scripts as well that Bridge can batch process? Where does the LiveTrace script really live?</p>  <p>I have to process a few thousand files and manual script triggering isn't an option. </p>  <p>The settings allow to load scripts, but I couldn't find a way to start them.</p>
