<p>i have a folder with multiple PDF files, i want to combine them into one file in a particular order. Problem is: the names of the files arent always the same and i want to use this on many files. For example today: folder has : optin.pdf, Yes.pdf..etc, but tomorrow it can have optin-23.pdf, Yes-27. AND there wont always be ever file.. For example i may have 6/10 files today. but tomorrows file could have all 10</p>  <p>So i need something that can combine files based off of segments of their names. like take every file that says "yes" or"optin". And i need it to then combine in a certain order. This is using FoxitPhantomPDF or Adobe</p>  <p>Is this even possible?</p>  <p>Thanks guys and girls</p>
