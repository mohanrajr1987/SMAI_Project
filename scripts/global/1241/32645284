<p>I am using camera object to detect whether camera is attached or not and also to find if camera is attached or remove after some time.now I am facing problem that initially camera is unplugged now the status is no camera found.after that I plugged the camera now it show camera found but if again I unplugged the camera then it keep on showing camera is available.I am calling the camera object in timer.The code is as mentioned below</p>  <pre><code>import flash.media.Camera; import flash.media.Video;  var myTimer: Timer = new Timer(2000, 0); myTimer.addEventListener(TimerEvent.TIMER, timerListener); function timerListener(e: TimerEvent): void {  var cam: Camera = Camera.getCamera(); if (cam != null) { var vid: Video = new Video();     vid.attachCamera(cam);     addChild(vid);       trace("Camera Found");   } else {      trace("Camera Not Found"); }  } myTimer.start(); </code></pre>  <p>I need to detect at any point of time that camera is plugged in and working.</p>
