<p>I am setting up ACS commons error page for different languages. The DispatcherPassError 0 is needed for ACS commons at the apache level for this. This has been setup successfully.</p>  <p>However I also need to make sure that another set of error pages at the Apache web server level has to be display when AEM is down. For this DispatcherPassError 1 has to be enabled.</p>  <p>How do I make sure that I configure both in a way that they work in their own specific circumstances.</p>
