<p>I am referencing the <a href="https://github.com/blefebvre/aem-phonegap-kitchen-sink" rel="nofollow">aem-phonegap-kitchen-sink</a> and <a href="https://github.com/blefebvre/aem-phonegap-starter-kit" rel="nofollow">aem-phonegap-starter-kit</a>. I get to the point where I can export my PhoneGap application, build and run it. However, I tried adding additional images to one of my page templates. Only the image resource named <code>image</code> gets exported. All other images are ignored. If you see my content tree bellow, <code>image</code> will get exported as <code>page-one.img.png</code>, but the other two are ignored.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/vrqTj.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/vrqTj.png" alt="content tree"></a></p>  <p>I started to look into the ContentSync config of <a href="https://github.com/blefebvre/aem-phonegap-kitchen-sink" rel="nofollow">aem-phonegap-kitchen-sink</a> and [aem-phonegap-starter-kit] and I find these handlers getting referenced</p>  <ul> <li>mobileapprootpage</li> <li>mobileapppages</li> <li>mobilepageassets</li> <li>mobilecontentlisting</li> </ul>  <p>I look up the <a href="http://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-1/develop/mobile-web/contentsync.html" rel="nofollow">content sync documentation</a> (I'm using 6.1) but that only makes mention of the simple handlers like <code>copy</code> and <code>assets</code>.</p>  <p>I looked all over the place and I can't find documentation on them. I figured that the <code>mobilepageassets</code> is what is exporting my image.</p>  <p>So how can I get my other images exported?</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>  <p>I tried to add <code>wcm/foundation/components/image</code> to a <code>com.day.cq.wcm.contentsync.impl.handler.PagesUpdateHandler</code> OSGi configuration. This had no effect. I also tried switching my image resource types to <code>foundation/components/image</code>. That had no effect either.</p>
