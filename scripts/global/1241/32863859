<p>I'm making a form with Livecycle Designer ES4. I found the perfect Initial layout of the form by doing this in the docReady Event:</p>  <pre><code>event.target.viewState = {overViewMode:4}; </code></pre>  <p>but now my cursor is that annyoing hand-icon, how do I change it back to the regular selection Icon, preferably using JS?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/7k61F.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/7k61F.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
