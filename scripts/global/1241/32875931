<p>Several years ago I built a system around Flex Builder 2 and ColdFusion 8. It uses MySQL 5.5 and Web Services The application ran very nicely for several years on a hosted server. Then I "moth-balled" it for several years. I tried to revive it a few months ago only to find that the world had changed considerably. Adobe gave Flex to Apache and ColdFusion was up to version 11.</p>  <p>I know that I have to migrate to CF10 or CF11,but I wouldlike to use all of the MXML code that I had been using. I installed CF11 and found that all of the data from MySQL was displaying in Flex 2 as nulls. I did some instrumentation on the CF code and found that the query return data, while still on the server looked correct; however when viewed on the client all of the data was displaying as nulls.   </p>  <p>I hope that someone has also experienced this and can help me with a solution.</p>  <p>Thank you, Lionel Bentkower</p>
