<p>I have the following Adobe provided code which is used in the "Customize Page Code section of the Adobe Analytics Tool set-up.</p>  <pre><code> function getAnalyticsAccount() {     // Used to retrieve the satellite configuration report suite     for (var toolid in _satellite.tools) {          if (_satellite.tools[toolid].settings.engine == "sc") {             console.log("---&gt; toolid: " + toolid, _satellite.tools[toolid]);             return _satellite.tools[toolid].settings.account;         }     } } </code></pre>  <p>The issue is in a production environment, I'm getting a dev report suite returned which I believe is due to the sCodeURL pointing to the staging version of the satellite-Lib.js file. <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/P4k0N.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/P4k0N.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I'm not sure how DTM determines which version of the file to load. Does anyone know? Does anyone know more about this functionality?</p>  <p>Thanks, MJ</p>
