<p>When I preview the video file locally it's 8 seconds long and there's no slate in front.  When I open it in Adobe Media Encoder there is now a 7 second slate appearing in front of the video.  The slate contains all the normal info you'd see on a slate which makes me think the original has one but Quicktime is just skipping over it.  If anyone has any suggestions or insights into why this might be happening that'd be great.  </p>  <p>I ran the video through ffprobe and it returned this, could the -7 start time be an issue?</p>  <p>Metadata:     major_brand     : mp42     minor_version   : 1     compatible_brands: mp41mp42isom     creation_time   : 2015-09-03 16:03:19   Duration: 00:00:08.01, start: -7.007589, bitrate: 2486 kb/s     Stream #0:0(und): Video: h264 (Main) (avc1 / 0x31637661), yuv420p(tv, smpte170m/bt709/bt709), 1940x500 [SAR 1:1 DAR 97:25], 1313 kb/s, 23.84 fps, 23.98 tbr, 90k tbn, 180k tbc (default)     Metadata:       creation_time   : 2015-09-03 16:03:19       handler_name    : Core Media Video</p>  <p>Thanks for any help :)</p>
