<p>I have some pdf uploaded on my website. I want my clients to fill them out on my website, and save a filled out copy to their system. The only way I have found this could be done is by clicking on print button and then save from there. </p>  <p>Can it possibly be done any other way. Does using Adobe LiveCycle could help?</p>  <p>Thanks in Advance.</p>
