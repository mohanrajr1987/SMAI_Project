<p>I am using trail version of <code>RoboHelp 2015</code>, I have few issues when I open <code>web-help</code> popups from the links in webpage.</p>  <p>I click on help on page, which opens a <code>web-help</code> as a popup or new tab with focus on it. In the a scenario I keep that window open and navigate back to main website and do some work and in some other page I click help which loads respective content to that window but doesn't get focused.</p>  <p>Help would be appreciated.</p>
