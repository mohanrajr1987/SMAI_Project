<p>I've developed a small HTML5 extension for Adobe premiere pro. It's purely written in javascript with no server side script. This Extension interacts with the host using Extendscript(.jsx). Now, I would like to set a trial as well as full commercial license for this extension. Since, it's written purely in javascript I'm afraid of it being misused. Please suggest.</p>
