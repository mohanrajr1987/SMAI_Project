<p>Does anyone know if it is possible to reference assets outside of a project in Edge Animate? I want to have a top level folder of scripts and images that are referenced by multiple banners.</p>  <p>I've hand coded stuff in the past and done it this way using shared assets during the build and then using Gulp to copy and package those assets for deployment.</p>  <p>Is there anything like this in Edge or is each projects an isolated package that has to contain all it's own assets?</p>  <p>Thanks for any advice on the matter</p>
