<p>How can I organize an Edge animations output so that there is no includes files? The images are all SVG so I'm hoping to be able to include those inline as well. </p>  <p>I've tried playing around with it and moving the JS files into the HTML but it doesn't work right and I'm not sure where to place the SVG code as the Edge file includes it as an image path in the <code>symbols</code> array. </p>  <p>The use case is that I'm loading it into an iframe within another page in Wordpress however the server thats it's on is a bit slow and it has a noticeable delay of nothingness before it loads so I'd like to just paste all the code into the iframe directly onpage like:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;iframe width="500" height="315"&gt; &lt;!-- ... edge code with everything inline ... --&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I'll continue playing around with the files and editing the Edge files directly but hoping to get an answer here before I spend too much time doing that.</p>
