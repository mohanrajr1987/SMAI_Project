<p>I'm creating a fillable form in Adobe DC.<br> I have the following sheet set up: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZPUuF.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZPUuF.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I'm trying to set up the total cost field to auto populate with the cost when check marks are made.  </p>  <p>I know very little JS, so I'm really struggling on trying to get this variable to populate automatically.  </p>  <p>The select checkboxes are:</p>  <ul> <li>selectiPhone </li> <li>selectSwipe</li> <li>selectMonitor (I would really like to multiply the amount pushed to the total by the amount in the notes field, which is a number field, defaulting to 1</li> <li>selectDesktop</li> <li>selectLaptop</li> <li>selectiPadCell</li> <li>selectiPad</li> <li>selectPhone</li> </ul>
