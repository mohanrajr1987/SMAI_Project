<p>We have an existing site that is built and deployed in Adobe CQ5.5.</p>  <p>Now we are planning to migrate it to AEM 6. We have successfully installed the instance and deployed the site.</p>  <p>But when we try making any changes like adding a new component it does not allow the operation. It says something <strong>"Your request could not be completed because you have signed out"</strong></p>  <p><strong>Does anyone know of this issue? How do I resolve this?</strong></p>
