<p>I want to pull data from my adobe form to put in the subject - but I think I'm running into an issue because I'm trying to put javascript vars in what's supposed to be HTML code.</p>  <pre><code>var todaysdate = this.getField("DWH").value; var foreman = this.getField("Foreman").value;  this.mailDoc({ bUI: false, cTo: "test@testing.com", cSubject: "New Daily from "+ foreman + " " + todaysdate", cMsg: "placeholder text" }); </code></pre>  <p>I need this to be sent as an entire PDF, not FDF.  I looked up the API references for Adobe Javascript, and couldn't find any help there regarding putting PDF Form data in.</p>  <p>Currently, this gives me an unterminated string literal on the subject line.</p>
