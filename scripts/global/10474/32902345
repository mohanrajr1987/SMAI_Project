<p>I have a table inside modal that has several hundreds items. Each item row is associated with particular bag. All bags are listed on a page and when user clicks <strong>"Add Items"</strong> modal opens up and shows all rows. </p>  <p>Now each row contain a class that correspond to its bag. I want to show only those rows that has same class as of that bag. I applied simple jQuery but that function only works on first page and rest of the pages shows all rows.</p>  <p>Is there any built in function provided by Datatables that could be used for this purpose.</p>
