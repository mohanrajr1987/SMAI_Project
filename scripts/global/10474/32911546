<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15172873/how-to-destroy-a-datatable">I'm essentially using the top answer here ( from sdespont) to try to destroy some tables. </a></p>  <p>I have one table that shows me the status of a .csv file being uploaded.</p>  <p><strong>FileuploadTable:</strong></p>  <pre><code>FileName FileType FileSize AvailableActions </code></pre>  <p>I have a second table that is the table displaying data from the .csv file. </p>  <p>I need provide the user the ability to reset the form, i.e. get rid of the .csv, and get rid of all of the data, <code>destroy()</code> the two tables separately, and <code>empty()</code> them of all the data that was there initially. </p>  <p>Here is the issue I'm running into.</p>  <p>I can't seem to <em>set</em> the column titles of FileUploadTable after <code>destroy()</code> and  <code>empty()</code>. When I attempt to upload a new file, the  elements are still on the page, just empty, though the same initialization is being called</p>  <p>I can't seem to <em>get rid</em> of the column titles in CSVTable after <code>destroy()</code> and <code>empty()</code>. When I attempt to upload a different csv, it tries to match column headers to the ones that <em>should have been destroyed</em>, but they don't match because, though CSVTable was destroyed and emptied, the column titles are still there...?</p>  <p>Not sure what I'm missing. They're being set properly on initial create. </p>  <pre><code>$(elem).DataTable()  </code></pre>  <p>Can anyone show me a basic working implementation of destroying/emptying datatables, then re initializing with different data, so I can try to mimic it. My brain is mush from looking at their docs for the last 3 days, making no progress. </p>  <p>Example of my data object</p>  <pre><code>[     {         //key = column title         //"val" = data in row         //object = row         key: "val",         //i.e.         FirstName: "Bob",         LastName: "Barker",         Age: 800,         //etc     },     //etc ] </code></pre>
