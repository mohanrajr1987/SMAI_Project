<p>For my website I use the <a href="https://www.datatables.net/" rel="nofollow">dataTable</a> plugin and to give the user the possibility to filter the results. I implemented some filter, which are dynamically loaded from the results and contains the all different values of each column. </p>  <p>As more than one filter can be combined, I deactived the smart search and had to active the regEx-search instead. All these things are working fine. </p>  <p><strong>My Problem is:</strong> I have content like "content (another content)", and for those contents containing brackets, the search doesn't work (no result is found).</p>  <p>Is there a possibility to mask the <code>searchString</code> before calling:</p>  <pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>table.column('myColumn:name').search(searchString, true, false, true).draw(); </code></pre>  <p>I tried to replace the string with "\)" or something like this, but that doesn't help. If I just delete those special characters the results can't be found either as regEx search needs exact strings.</p>  <p>Can anyone help me please?</p>
