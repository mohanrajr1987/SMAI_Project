<p>I'm using DataTables.net to insert a Table in my website. I also added a function to add/remove columns in this table. In order to fit the container size, I change the font-size in the table in respect to the column number. I find a solution how to do this with this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32776967/datatables-net-custom-font-size-after-sorting">answer</a>.<br> <br>  This worked perfect but when I changed my table to be generated with server side processing (There are a lot of data to display), the <code>rowCallback</code> does fire but the class is not appended and though the font-size doesn't change. It can't be the code because it work on other situations too (for example if a column is set visible/invisible). <br></p>  <pre><code>   rowCallback: function( nRow, aData, iDisplayIndex, iDisplayIndexFull ) {       $('#table tr td').attr('class',getFontSize(counter));       $('#table tr th').attr('class',getFontSize(counter));     }, </code></pre>  <p><br> Is it possible that there is a connection to the modified creation with server side processing?</p>
