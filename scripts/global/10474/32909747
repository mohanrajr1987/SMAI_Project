<p>I am using jQuery DataTables. It provides set of export buttons. But those buttons are swf buttons.</p>  <p>I would like to have HTML drop down buttons. I have gone through its help but could not found such code to set HTML5 buttons other than built in Flash.</p>  <p>I would like to have drop down buttons like below</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Export<br>        - PDF<br>        - CSV<br>        - HTML<br>        - Excel</p> </blockquote>  <p>Above buttons are set of HTML tags (generally what they are in HTML). Can I do that?</p>  <h2><strong>Edit:</strong></h2>  <p>I would like to generate buttons using <code>button</code>, <code>div</code>, <code>ul</code>, <code>li</code> tags combination which we generally do in our regular HTML files.</p>
