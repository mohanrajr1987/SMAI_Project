<p>In my React application, I am using jquery Datatable table.</p>  <p>Initially the table loads fine. Whenever I am trying to override the data with a new data, it is throwing the error "Invariant Violation: processUpdates(): Unable to find child 10 of element. This probably means the DOM was unexpectedly mutated.."</p>  <p>I searched on this issue. What I understood is since the datatable plugin is directly mutating the DOM, React is getting confused on state change. One solution I got is call the datatable on willComponentUpdate. But, it is not working for me. Not sure on how to solve this issue. </p>  <p>Thanks for helping. </p>  <p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false"> <div class="snippet-code"> <pre class="snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>$('#topicsTable')   .addClass('initialized')   .dataTable({     order: [       [4, "desc"]     ],     columnDefs: [{       targets: [-1],       className: 'hidden'     }]   });</code></pre> </div> </div> </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/OaLKF.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/OaLKF.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
