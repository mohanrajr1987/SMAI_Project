<p>I have an app in which I have invoices. I am trying to give user a page where he can see the detail invoice and also print it. The issue is with the CSS for that print page. </p>  <p>I have tables in there. I am using <a href="http://datatables.net/" rel="nofollow">jQuery DataTables</a>. Is there an easy way or tutorial to follow for writing CSS for the print page? I can leave using table for that page but I would prefer if I can keep using tables.</p>
