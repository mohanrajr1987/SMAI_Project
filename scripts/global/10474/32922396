<p>I am using dataTable plugin in my PHP project.  I have set the datatable to use fullwidth. The datatable plugin is generating column width &amp; setting it to fixed size for each column. I have totally 15 columns. However, I am using 1920x1080. Even then I see a horizontal bar, which actually doesn't show an additional column. The horizontal bar is just adjusting by 2px approx. </p>  <p>How can I get rid of horizontal bar in dataTable plugin?</p>
