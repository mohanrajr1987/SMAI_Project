<p>There is an option for displaying a search box to filter by. What if I would like to have a predefined select box to choose entries from for a particular field?</p>  <p>For instance, if I add a select element that has a list of categories that narrow the displayed rows by <code>category_id</code>. What part of the API would I used to tell DataTables to refresh the AJAX results based on the change in that value?</p>  <p>Obviously, I'd use <code>ajax.reload()</code> method, but how do I filter by that <code>category_id</code>?</p>
