<p>I have the following jQuery DataTable</p>  <pre><code>ID  |  IP Address   |Channel    |Format   1  |192.168.9.41   |News 1     | HD      2  |192.168.9.45   |Sports 1   | HD      3  |192.168.9.47   |Movie 1    | SD      4  |192.168.9.48   |ESPN HD    | HD      5  |192.168.9.49   |Talk       | SD     </code></pre>  <p>And applied the filter, let's say 'HD'. So, the data in table is as follow,</p>  <pre><code>ID  |  IP Address   |Channel    |Format   1  |192.168.9.41   |News 1     | HD      2  |192.168.9.45   |Sports 1   | HD      4  |192.168.9.48   |ESPN HD    | HD     </code></pre>  <p>The code to do that is below:</p>  <pre><code>$scope.filterValue = function(){     var table = $('#poolDetail').DataTable();     table.search($scope.currentFilter).draw(); } </code></pre>  <p>After this filter, I need to include the Channel 'Talk' that was hidden by filter. </p>  <p>How could I add a single row to the table?</p>
