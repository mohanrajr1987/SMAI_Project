<p>I am using jQuery DataTables.  I would like to customise the appearance of the page control so that it is clearer what the currently selected page number is.  I would like to either:</p>  <p>Have the currently selected page number enclosed by square brackets eg if page 2 was currently selected, 1 [2] 3 4 5 6 7  OR</p>  <p>Have the page numbers that are not selected underlined </p>  <p>But Iâ€™m unsure how to do this or if it is possible.</p>
