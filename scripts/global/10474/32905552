<p>I am using jquery-datatables and it works as a charm. I use it with serverside processing, with global and individual searchs by columns. I have a button on each table to export data on Excel. My users would like to export filtered and ordered data, I don't know how to get those informations.</p>  <p>Ideally, I would like a function that returns the same <a href="https://datatables.net/manual/server-side#Sent-parameters" rel="nofollow">data</a> as datatables send to the server when it calls it. </p>  <p>Has somebody any idea ?</p>
