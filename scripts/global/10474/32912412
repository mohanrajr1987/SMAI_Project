<p>I have a dynamically created (when I click on the cell) <code>&lt;input type=date&gt;</code> inside a cell of a DataTable. </p>  <p>I can select the date and looks good, now I get all the data in the table iterating each row because I process the data for every row, that works fine too, the problem is when I want to get the value from those inputs. </p>  <p>I tried with <code>data()</code> and <code>node()</code> but the value isn't shown on the HTML which I found out that was the way it's supposed to be, so I can't get it from the HTML, so I tried with the following code and it says it's undefined.</p>  <pre><code>table.rows().every( function ( rowIdx, tableLoop, rowLoop ) {         // Tried this - return undefined          var node = this.node();              alert(node.cells[0].value);// The typeof(node.cells[0]) is object HTMLTableCellElement           // also this - here shows the HTML without the updated date         var data = this.data();              alert(data);  }); </code></pre>  <p>Any ideas?</p>
