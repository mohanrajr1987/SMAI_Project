<p>I am trying to create a datatable that has vertical but not horizontal scrolling. The create table statement I am using here as follows:</p>  <pre><code>$(document).ready( function () {     $('#order-attention-table').DataTable( {         "bFilter": false,         "scrollY": 300,         "scrollX": false,         "paging":   false,         "ordering": false,         "info":     false,     }); } ); </code></pre>  <p>Currently my columns are wider than the screen and this causes a horizontal scroll bar to appear even with "scrollX": false. The only way I can get the horizontal scrollbar to not appear is by removing the "scrollY": 300. When I remove the verticle scrolling property the horizontal scroll bar goes away. </p>  <p>So my question is two parts.</p>  <ol> <li>How to I force the columns to fit the screen?</li> <li>How to I stop the horizontal scroll bar while still allowing vertical scrolling?</li> </ol>
