<p>I have an Access database with many tables. I created many groups and custom categories on the navigation pane to work more easily.  For some specific reasons, I need to open, run some macros, and close the Access database through a vbs script.  But when I open the Access database manually after running the vbs script, many tables are not longer on their custom categories and groups on the navigation pane, and assigning again these groups is a quite a long task.</p>  <p>Is there a way to get connected to the Access database without modifying the custom categories on the navigation pane?</p>  <p>Thanks,</p>  <p>FYI, the way I connect to the databse through the vbs script is:</p>  <pre><code>set accessApp = CreateObject("Access.Application") accessApp.OpenCurrentDatabase "C:\DATABASE.mdb" accessApp.DoCmd.RunMacro "MACRO I WANT TO RUN FROM VBS SCRIPT" accessApp.CloseCurrentDatabase accessApp.Quit set accessApp = nothing </code></pre>
