<p>I am analyzing a series of reports in an Access database.  Currently, this project is non-functional as the data is in SQL Server and I don't have permissions to it at the moment. Some of the reports have recordsource and filter set programmatically and others are set using the properties -> data tab. One of my colleagues offhandedly mentioned that he thinks report filters may not be applied when the reports are called programmatically if they are set using the properties -> data tab. Of course, he said that and then wandered off and now I'm not sure how to verify this. Is this the case? Can anyone point me to documentation on this?</p>
