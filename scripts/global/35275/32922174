<p>I am working on a report design and I am having a hard time with this expression in MS Access. </p>  <pre><code>=IIf([Field1]="Yes","ïƒ¼"," ") </code></pre>  <p>Is it wrong? </p>  <p>I tried removing <code>="Yes"</code> from the equation to see if will work and yes it works but if I return this <code>="Yes"</code> in the equation I always get this error: <code>#Type!</code></p>  <p>It should check <code>Field1</code> if equal to Yes then if true it will display a character then if not it will display nothing </p>  <p>What should I do?</p>
