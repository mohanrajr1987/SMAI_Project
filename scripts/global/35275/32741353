<p>I want to populate a table in Access that I've just created. I gave it 6 columns. I also made a form that has 6 field inputs. But now I'm confused as to how exactly you make the form write to the table. I want the table to populate downwards, not just re-updating one row every time (in a previous attempt I managed to have the fields save over the same row, but this isn't what I want). I can provide any extra info as needed.</p>
