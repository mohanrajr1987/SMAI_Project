<p>I'm a bit inexperienced but have a managed to learn how to use my database (access2010) but now I need to remove old files. In the database I have a primary table with multiple tables which stores additional information such as my notes. </p>  <p>I can't seem to figure out how to remove old files based on an input date. I want to remove all files and the data stored in the dependent tables completely from year 2011 and back after backing up the database. </p>  <p>I've tried a delete query, and I've tried to simply copy and past inside the tables. I know there has to be a way to do this without deleting individual files.</p>  <p>When I run a delete query I get invalid key errors and when I delete files from my primary table, I get errors indicating there are associated data stored in the other tables.</p>  <p>Since I can't seem to delete all data across all tables for a certain date range, can anyone point out what I might be doing wrong? </p>
