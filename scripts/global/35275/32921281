<p>Access 2010, I have ribbon menu, where appears contextual tab when user opens an edit form. I don’t see how to change the caption of this contextual tab (red square on picture), it’s always equal to form caption (blue square). Is it possible?<a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/VVQMe.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/VVQMe.png" alt="Screenshot"></a></p>
