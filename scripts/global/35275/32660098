<p>I need to query a general date field in Access Table from Excel.  Please suggest how to format the date correctly for the query to work.  It is probably a minor detail that I’m missing in the query that I can’t figure it out. I've tried to format the date differently and the query worked if the format of date field in Access was changed to <strong>short date</strong> but not with general date format that I need to use.  Here is what worked to query short date in Access:</p>  <p><code>SQLwhere = SQLwhere &amp; "[MDL_Table1].[UploadDate] BETWEEN " &amp;</code> <code>Format(UserForm1.txtStartDate, "\#mm\/dd\/yyyy\#") &amp; " AND " _</code>  <code>&amp; Format(UserForm1.txtEndDate, "\#mm\/dd\/yyyy\#") &amp; " AND "</code></p>  <p>I'm including a part of my code.  I've used this code to perform other queries and it worked fine. Also, getDate method does return the date. Please see my code below:</p>  <pre class="lang-vb prettyprint-override"><code>Dim qc1 As String Dim DateMin As String Dim DateMax As String 'add error handling  On Error GoTo errHandler:  'Disable screen flickering. 'FastWB True, 3 DateMin = Format(frmCalendar.getDate(DateMin), "mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss AM/PM") DateMax = Format(frmCalendar.getDate(DateMax), "mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss AM/PM") Sheet1.Range("A2:AK5000").ClearContents dbPath = "H:\DEMO\MDL_IonTorrent.accdb"  'set the search variable qc1 = "_QC"  Set cnn = New ADODB.Connection ' Initialise the collection class variable cnn.Open "Provider=Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0;Data Source=" &amp; dbPath  SQLwhere = "WHERE "  SQLwhere = SQLwhere &amp; "[MDL_Table1].[UploadDate] BETWEEN #" &amp; DateMin &amp; "#     AND #" _ &amp; DateMax &amp; "# AND "  SQLwhere = SQLwhere &amp; "[MDL_Table1].[AAchange] LIKE '" &amp; "%" &amp; qc1 &amp; "%" &amp; "' AND " strSQL = "SELECT * FROM [MDL_Table1] "  'Remove the last AND applicable If SQLwhere = "WHERE " Then     SQLwhere = "" Else     SQLwhere = Left(SQLwhere, Len(SQLwhere) - 5) End If  strSQL = strSQL &amp; SQLwhere Set rs = New ADODB.Recordset 'assign memory to the recordset rs.Open strSQL, cnn </code></pre>
