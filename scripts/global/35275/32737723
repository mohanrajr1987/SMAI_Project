<p>I have a number of stacked queries (QueryA -> QueryB -> QueryC -> QueryD -> AppendTable). If I run AppendTable query will all the previous stacked queries update or do I have to update individually.</p>  <p>I know that if I had these as sub-queries they would be run but for the moment I need to keep them as stacked queries not sub-queries.</p>  <p>(Sorry for the simplistic question but have been unable to find a direct answer.)</p>
