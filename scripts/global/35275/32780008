<p>What's wrong with my code. All i want is that if I click <code>rdbNormal</code> (a RadioButton) then select "A" in <code>cmbBuilding</code> (a ComboBox), all the RoomNo having roomtype "normal" and building "A" will be displayed. Here's my code </p>  <pre><code>Try     cn.Open()     If rdbNormal.Checked = True Then         Dim DataSet As New DataSet         Dim DataTable As New DataTable         Dim DataAdapter As New OleDbDataAdapter("SELECT * FROM RoomTable Where Building = '" &amp; cmbBuilding.Text &amp; "' and RoomType = Normal ", cn)         DataAdapter.Fill(DataTable)          If DataTable.Rows.Count &gt; 0 Then             With cmbRoomNo                 .Items.Clear()                 For i As Integer = 0 To DataTable.Rows.Count - 1                     .Items.Add(DataTable.Rows(i).Item(3))                 Next                 .SelectedIndex = -1             End With         End If         DataTable.Dispose()         DataAdapter.Dispose()     End If  Catch ex As Exception     MsgBox(ex.Message) End Try cn.Close() </code></pre>
