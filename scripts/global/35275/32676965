<p>I have a query:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT FD.PatternValue, FD.Service_ID, FD.PatternStartDate, Count(FD.PatternValue) AS CountOfPatternValue FROM FWPD AS FD INNER JOIN ME ON FD.ID = ME.ID WHERE (((FD.PatternStartDate) Between #5/1/2015# And #5/5/2015#) AND ((ME.WorkGroup)="ATSA")) GROUP BY FD.PatternValue, FD.Service_ID, FD.PatternStartDate; </code></pre>  <p>I want to make it so that it becomes a two column header crosstab query, in Access 2010, so that it can be used as a rowsource for a graph showing two grouping levels on the x-axis.</p>  <p>The date would be the lowest level, then there would be each Service_ID above that and then a count of of each pattern value in each service.</p>  <p>I am learning SQL and needed help with how to to get this query done. I believe it requires union all between two crosstabs, but do not know how to do this.</p>  <p>What i am trying to achieve is this:</p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18776078/barplot-x-axis-labels-with-hierarchical-grouping-variables-in-separate-rows">barplot x-axis labels with hierarchical grouping variables in separate rows</a></p>  <p>but in  Access 2010 on a graph</p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
