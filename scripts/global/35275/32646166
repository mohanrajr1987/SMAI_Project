<p>Is it possible to create a data macro in Access 2010 that would send an email with variable values in its body?</p>  <p>What I am trying to do is this: When a specific field is changed than an email is sent stating that the field has been changed and who has changed it (based on a parameter captured at login). Creating the email data macro is simple enough, but I cannot see how to put anything but static text into the body!?</p>
