<p>What's the best way to get multiple columns in a crosstab query? I have the following table:</p>  <pre><code>ID  Name    Topic   Date 123 John    Define  9/30/2015 123 John    Measure 10/30/2015 123 John    Analyze 11/30/2015 321 Mary    Measure 8/28/2015 321 Mary    Define  7/15/2015 321 Mary    Define  6/15/2015 </code></pre>  <p>This is the result I'm looking for:</p>  <pre><code>ID  Name    Define  Define Date Measure Measure Date    Analyze Analyze Date 123 John       1      9/30/2015   1     10/30/2015        1     11/30/2015 321 Mary       2      7/15/2015   1     8/28/2015        </code></pre>  <p>I created a crosstab query to pivot the topics and count in columns but I have not figured out how to add another column for the date next to the count.</p>  <p>I could have multiple topics with different dates but I will use a Max to get the latest date. Thanks!</p>
