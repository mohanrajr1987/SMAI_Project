<p>I'm writing a tool for a user that does not run Office Professional (Office Standard).  Which means that they don't have MSAccess installed on their system. So the following code fails (called from Excel):</p>  <pre><code>    Dim appAccess As Object     Set appAccess = CreateObject("Access.Application")     With appAccess         .OpenCurrentDatabase Range("DBfile")         .Application.Run "importmms"         .Quit     End With </code></pre>  <p>Although I think this used to work (so then I'm looking for why this code is not working anymore on the Standard license machine), it's not working anymore.  So I am trying to find a solution for <strong>importing a .csv</strong> file into an <strong>Access table</strong> from <strong>VBA in Excel</strong> on a machine that <strong>does not run MS Access</strong>.</p>
