<p>I have a GUI in my database that hides the ribbon bars.  I have a Rich Text textbox.  I would like the user to be able to apply formatting to the text in the textbox.  If the user selects a range of text with the mouse the rich text formatting context menu will popup automatically.  However, if the user selects text with the cursor keys, or, wants to start a numbered or bulleted list, there is no sensible way to get the formatting context menu to appear.  Right-clicking does not bring up the formatting context menu.</p>  <p>Is there a way to bring up the formatting context menu some other way, e.g., with a button using VBA code or ... ?</p>
