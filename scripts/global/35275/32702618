<p>I created a form for some Liaisons to use when they visit Dr.s offices. They will visit many of the same Dr's offices over and over again so I want to them to pull up information from their last visit with all the contact information for the physicians. </p>  <p>I have my form split into two sections: </p>  <p>The first section has the name of the office, address, and other things that don't usually change.  The second section has fields relevant to their current visit. </p>  <p>I want them to be able to search and pull up, into the form, everything they did from the last visit. I already created a button to clear the second half once they have looked over everything they did during their last visit. </p>  <p>Any help is greatly appreciated. </p>  <p>I should also mention that I am new to Access so please be patient if I don't understand immediately.</p>
