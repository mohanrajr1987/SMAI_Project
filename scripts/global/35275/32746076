<p>The below code works great for refreshing an external link in vba however is there a way of changing the location of the link?</p>  <p>I can do this using linked table manager when ticking the 'Always prompt for new location', but I would like to do this via VBA, so that I could create a button for users to press to locate the new workbook</p>  <p>Select new workbook, Relink external excel workbook.</p>  <pre><code>Function Relink()      Set db = CurrentDb     Set tdf = db.TableDefs("Sales")     tdf.Connect = "Excel 5.0;HDR=YES;IMEX=2;" &amp; _     "DATABASE=C:\Sales.xlsb"     tdf.RefreshLink  End Function </code></pre>
