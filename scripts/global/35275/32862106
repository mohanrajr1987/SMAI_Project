<p>I have a linked table in my MS Access 2010 Database. The table is importing 9 columns from a text file that contains approx. 150 columns.</p>  <p><strong>- Is there anyway to modify the linked table and change one column but keep the rest?</strong></p>  <p>My research on the web thus far has indicated that this is not possible. I wanted to ask the question here to verify. Seemingly this would be a problem that many users encounter, so there must be an intelligent solution to this problem, or at least a decent workaround.</p>  <p><strong>- Should the answer to the first question be "no", is there at least a way to determine which columns are being pulled from the source file?</strong></p>  <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> As suggested in the comments I am including the design view Description Property of my table. Unfortunately it only provides the File Source.</p>  <pre><code>Text;DSN=Olsdrdp_offerttool Link Specification2;FMT=Delimited;HDR=NO;IMEX=2;CharacterSet=1252;ACCDB=YES;DATABASE=W:\FTP\ITS150\07_Model_Pfos;TABLE=olsdrdp_offerttool#csv </code></pre>
