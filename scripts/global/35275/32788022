<p>I am working on an Access DB, which have ODBC linked SQL Server table, and I have following script to run TSQL query, as you can see I tried to include a value from Access Forms in the query, but it fails to run. The form is opened and filled with data when I execute the script. I am wondering if this is impossible or there is another way of doing it? I am new to TSQL and SQL server, here is my question. Appreicate if someone can help. Thanks a lot. </p>  <pre><code>Function formtest() Dim qryd As QueryDef Set qryd = CurrentDb.CreateQueryDef("") qryd.Connect = "ODBC;DSN=SQLSERVER;" qryd.SQL = "UPDATE dbo.table1 SET firstname = [Forms]![testform]![datainput]" qryd.ReturnsRecords = False qryd.Execute End Function </code></pre>
