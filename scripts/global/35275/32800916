<p>I have a query being displayed, customer information, with a field that says if the customer is on credit hold.  What I would like the access program to do is change a blank text box to a red background and the text "Customer On Hold".  This would be controlled by the field in the query.   My question is has anyone done this?   Should be easy, but I am at a loss as to how to do it.</p>
