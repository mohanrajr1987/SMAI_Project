<p>My code is below. It opens the report, but it looks like it stops there. It never reaches the message box. So I'm guessing that it's failing at the export part. But my breakpoints don't trigger when I click my button. So I can't see what's happening.</p>  <p>Any ideas on what's going on?</p>  <pre><code>Private Sub Command552_Click()     DoCmd.OpenReport "report_name", acViewPreview, , "[RowID] = 16094"     DoCmd.OutputTo acOutputReport, "", acFormatPDF, "C:\Users\name\Desktop\test.pdf", True      DoCmd.Close acReport, "report_name"      MsgBox ("done") End Sub </code></pre>
