<p>As I saw many of the Login System's Database got a field for a series of Constrained ID arranged, it rises me up the question for my Login System Database Design, is that necessary.</p>  <p>The problem is, assume there is a register system, when the user registers an account, the <code>account name</code> is already unique, as the system will warn you for unavailable <code>account name</code>, because they are repeated in the database. So do we need a constrained ID arrangement for each successful register? Even though it allows repeated <code>account name</code>, cant we just use the user's <code>ID card no.</code> as the unique field? </p>  <p>Or assume there is no register system, the admin allocate the account, we can still use their <code>ID card no.</code> as the unique field.</p>  <p>It is not like there will be search efficiency or well-organized data structure. We do not identity record by the arrangement, but the unique field. There will also be redundancy if there is already another Unique field.</p>  <p>So far my Login System requires the <code>MemberID</code> and <code>Password</code> to login, <code>MemberID</code> is the constrained ID arrangement allocated by the system, which makes me think should I let the user create their whole <code>account name</code> or <code>ID card no.</code> and remove the <code>MemberID</code>.</p>  <p>Did I misunderstand the usage of them? Or is there a reason for it? Did a good data design need such constrained unique ID ?</p>
