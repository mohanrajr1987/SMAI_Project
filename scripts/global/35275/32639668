<p>I have a form (MainForm) with 2 subforms, sfrmA &amp; sfrmB. I need to call a procedure (ProcInB) in sfrmB from sfrmA . None of these work:</p>  <pre><code>Forms!MainForm.sfrmB.Form.ProcInB Call MainForm.Forms.sfrmB.ProcInB Forms!MainForm![sfrmB].Form.ProcInB Call MainForm.Forms.sfrmB.ProcInB Call Forms.MainForm.ProcInB </code></pre>  <p>I've also tried parentheses, quotes, etc. Nothing seems to work and an exhaustive search hasn't provided this specific situation or solution.</p>  <p>Hope someone has the answer!</p>  <p>Thx!</p>
