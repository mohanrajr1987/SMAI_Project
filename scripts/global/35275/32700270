<p>Good morning All,</p>  <p>I am working on the following however, I can't figure it out for the life of me. I have table that contains a bunch of due dates. What I am trying to do is add a query that adds another field and inserts a yes if the date equals a day in last week. Honestly I need it to insert yes as long as it does not = this week. </p>  <p>I've tried using:</p>  <pre><code>Urgent: IIf([Due Date]=[Due Date]  Between  DateAdd("d",1-Weekday(Date()) 7, Date()) And  DateAdd("d",1-Weekday(Date())-1, Date()),"Yes","") </code></pre>  <p>with no luck. What am I missing here?!</p>  <p>Thanks all. Cheers.</p>
