<p>I'm a little desperate, hence why I'm here! I'm quite new to programming and have been given an assignment where I need to use a range of SQL queries to generate a simple HTML report table. There is also a user input, with them selecting the ClinicID from the comboBox and clicking a button to generate the report.</p>  <p><strong>Basically, I have a comboBox that I have populated with 'ClinicID', as below. I have also made sure that SelectedIndex is working. I need to somehow use this in the SQL query method which I have also provided below.</strong></p>  <pre><code>Public Class frmReport1 'Set lsData for Clinics table Dim lsData As List(Of Hashtable)   'On form load Private Sub frmReport1_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load      cboClinicID.DropDownStyle = ComboBoxStyle.DropDownList      'Instantiate new ClinicController object     Dim cController As ClinicController = New ClinicController      'Load ClinicID     lsData = cController.findId()      For Each clinic In lsData         cboClinicID.Items.Add(CStr(clinic("ClinicID")))     Next  End Sub  'Selected Index  Private Sub cboClinicID_SelectedIndexChanged(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles cboClinicID.SelectedIndexChanged     Dim selectedIndex As Integer = cboClinicID.SelectedIndex     Dim selectedItem As Object = cboClinicID.SelectedItem      'Print in debug window     Debug.Print("Selected clinicID: " &amp; selectedItem.ToString())     Debug.Print("Selected clinicID index: " &amp; selectedIndex.ToString())      Dim htData = lsData.Item(selectedIndex)   End Sub </code></pre>  <p><strong>SQL query method - **note, I'm pulling from two different tables</strong>:</p>  <p>Where the '?' is, is where I assume I have to work in the 'SelectedItem' but I have no idea how!</p>  <p><strong>Desired result: an html table outputted with these three selected fields.</strong></p>  <pre><code>Public Class ClinicOrderController  Public Const CONNECTION_STRING As String = "Provider=Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0;Data Source=PharmDB.accdb"  'Dim cController As ClinicController = New ClinicController 'Dim oController As OrderController = New OrderController  Public Function findClinicOrder() As List(Of Hashtable)      'Instantiates a connection object     Dim oConnection As OleDbConnection = New OleDbConnection(CONNECTION_STRING)     'Instantiates a list of hashtables     Dim lsData As New List(Of Hashtable)      Try         Debug.Print("Connection string: " &amp; oConnection.ConnectionString)          oConnection.Open()         Dim oCommand As OleDbCommand = New OleDbCommand         oCommand.Connection = oConnection          'Stored in the CommandText property of the command object         'SELECT SQL statement         oCommand.CommandText = "SELECT clinics.clinic_id, orders.date_ordered, orders.total_price FROM clinics, orders WHERE clinics.clinic_id = orders.clinic_id AND clinics.clinic_id = ?

Ive been struggling with this for more than 8 hours (not joking - I give you permission to laugh)</p>
