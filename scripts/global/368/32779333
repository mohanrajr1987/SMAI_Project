<p>I am trying to start learning about writing encryption algorithms, so while using python I am trying to manipulate data down to a binary level so I can add bits to the end of data as well as manipulate to obscure the data.</p>  <p>I am not new to programming I am actually a programmer but I am relatively new to python which is why I am struggling a bit.</p>  <p>can anyone show me the best way to manipulate, in python, a string down to the binary level (or recommend in what way I should approach this). I have looked at a number of questions:</p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18815820/convert-string-to-binary-in-python">Convert string to binary in python</a></p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3059301/manipulating-binary-data-in-python">Manipulating binary data in Python</a></p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7396849/convert-binary-to-ascii-and-vice-versa-python">Convert Binary to ASCII and vice versa (Python)</a></p>  <p>But all these are not what I am looking for and I do not know enough of python to be able to pick out what I need. can someone please assist me with details (if you use a function please explain what it is to me e.g. ord())</p>
