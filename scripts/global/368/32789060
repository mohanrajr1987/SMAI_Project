<p>everyone! I am trying to make a small program that takes in a "binary"(base 2) number and convert it to a "decimal"(base 10) number and vice versa. I'm trying to stick with basic operators and away from advanced arrays. </p>  <p>Here is my code so far:</p>  <pre><code>int main() {         string strPut;         int numOut = 0;         cout &lt;&lt; "Enter a number in binary \n";         cin &gt;&gt; strPut;         int pwr = strPut.length()-1;           for(int x = 0; x &lt;  strPut.length(); x++)         {                 numOut = strPut[x] * pow(2,pwr);                 pwr--;                 numOut += numOut;         }         cout &lt;&lt; numOut &lt; "\n";  return 0; } </code></pre>  <p>I am trying to take in a number such as "1101" and output "13". To do this my plan was to read in the binary number and use the binary multiples of 2 per each index to create the correct number. I am far more than lost on what I am doing wrong, I continuously get an output of "98".</p>
