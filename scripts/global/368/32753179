<p>My requirement is to change some text in exp file.<br></p>  <pre><code>string = reader.readLine(); //content of file  string .replaceAll("x", "Y"); //write string to file. </code></pre>  <p>I think it might create a file with garbage values. It shouldn't be treated as text file. So, Please help me in<br></p>  <ul> <li>Type of Stream to choose (Byte, Character, Buffer)</li> <li>Any encoding /decoding required</li> <li>what could be the size of BUFFER to avoid missing any content that needs to be replaced.</li> <li>can I even read binary files line by line just like text files.</li> </ul>
