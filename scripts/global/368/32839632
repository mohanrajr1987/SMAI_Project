<p>I'm trying to figure out the format of few dates that are available in numeric format. I need to convert them to exact dates. I have a sample dates that I was trying to convert:</p>  <pre><code>1443506173.0  &gt;&gt;  Sep 29, 2015 1443505895.0  &gt;&gt;  Sep 29, 2015 1441805416.0  &gt;&gt;  Sep 09, 2015 1438174556.0  &gt;&gt;  Jul 29, 2015 1436476814.0  &gt;&gt;  Jul 10, 2015 1414994162.0  &gt;&gt;  Nov 03, 2014 1413294207.0  &gt;&gt;  Oct 14, 2014 </code></pre>  <p>By looking at the first two entries, I can see that the numbers are changing but both are representing the same dates. Means there must be time embedded into this date format. Currently I'm concerned with extracting only date, I dont need to extract time at the moment. Would be great if it was simple enough to extract time as well.</p>  <p>Can anyone help figure this out? In case you're wondering, I got these dates from Instagram posts feed. Using WebClient I downloaded an Instagram photo's URL. This date format is there in the scripts section. If I'm able to decode this date format, I would know what the date (and time) of the photo post was at Instagram.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance. I'm using C# to perform this conversion.</p>
