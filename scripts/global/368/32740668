<p>I have extrememly small amount of experience with C programming. </p>  <p>The operating system is Linux. When you do <code>less</code> on a program file it shows a bunch of random characters, but it also shows some of the readable ASCII characters in the original C source code.</p>  <p>Is there a way to force comments to show up in the binary, preferably near the beginning of the program file so that someone could get an idea of what this is used for? The formatting of the comments does not have to be pretty, a continuous line of text is fine.</p>
