<p>I have a library that contains multiple bash scripts on a Linux. The main application, say <code>myApp.sh</code> will call different bash scripts to perform the tasks.</p>  <p>I have to compile all of these scripts into ONE binary file. With the SHC tool, I can only compile one file, and if I remove the other files, then the reference inside <code>myApp</code> is broken.</p>  <p>So how can I compile all of the bash scripts into one file and then run SHC on it?</p>
