<p>I'm sending binary data from java using POST and there are no fields. Here is java code:</p>  <pre><code>urlConnection.setRequestProperty("Content-Type", "application/octet-stream"); urlConnection.setRequestProperty("charset", "utf-8"); urlConnection.setRequestProperty("Content-Length", Integer.toString(length)); OutputStream out = new BufferedOutputStream(urlConnection.getOutputStream()); out.write(data); out.flush(); out.close(); </code></pre>  <p>How would the python code for receiving data look like on the server side? I spent a while to google how to read it in python but all I see is mostly using cgi and FieldStorage(). Please help me out.</p>
