<p>I FTP a lot of files with accents in the filenames.</p>  <p>When I use Transmit to transfer them in ASCII mode, the accents are not transferred correctly.</p>  <p>When I transfer them in binary mode, the accents are fine.</p>  <p><strong>This made me think: what's the benefit of using ASCII for FTP transfers?</strong></p>  <p><strong>Is there any reason not to use binary mode all the time?</strong></p>
