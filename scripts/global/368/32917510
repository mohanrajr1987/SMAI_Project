<p>Hi I have a binary file that contains lots of resources and using C# I want to find and parse the text objects in this file that are in ASCII like below</p>  <p>Lots of binary junk before</p>  <p>ONMAP 0 131072 "description " 0 "name" "FLAG" "FLAG" 7900.000000 0.000000 1499.999268 2.000000 6.000000 8.000000 1.000000 1.000000 1.000000 0 0 0 -1 1 0 0 -1 0.101900 2 36 255 followed by a line break</p>  <p>lots of binary junk after these objects</p>  <p>Each object begins with its tag ONMAP here, the values are separated by white space and the strings double quoted and must be read in the order they were written, we donâ€™t know where the data is in the file so I want to search through the binary until that onmap is found and read the properties  into a List but once found that onmap i dont know how to parse the properties in.</p>
