<p>I'm having issues with my overflow output on my circuit. It works as expected for signed positive numbers (0-32,767) but as soon as negative numbers (-1, -32,768) are introduced the overflow refuses to work. Any help is appreciated.</p>  <p>Circuit: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/BfCIVfd.png" rel="nofollow">http://i.imgur.com/BfCIVfd.png</a></p>  <p>Each four bit adder (A4Bit here): <a href="http://i.imgur.com/ygnJ8CO.png" rel="nofollow">http://i.imgur.com/ygnJ8CO.png</a></p>
