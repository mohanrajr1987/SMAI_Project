<p>I have made the following code. The idea is that this binStrToInt actually recognizes my string as an integer, and can turn it into the actual number. My peers have pointed out that my code has a few errors.  The only ones that I have noticed is that  1. math needs to be imported (for int) 2. return needs to be indented 3.  num = num + int(binary_Str[i]) the i shouldn't be in that line? The issue: it just doesn't work. I have no idea what to do</p>  <pre><code>def binStrToInt(binary_str):       """The function binStrToInt() takes in one input, a string of ones and      zeros (no spaces) called BINARY_STR.  It treats that input as a binary      number (base 2) and converts it to a decimal integer (base 10). It      returns an integer result."""      length = len(binary_str)      num = 0     for i in range(length)         num = num + int(binary_Str[i])         num = num * 2 return num / 2 </code></pre>
