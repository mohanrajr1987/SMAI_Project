<p>I've got this network flow problem which I have no idea how to start.</p>  <p>From the information I've been given about network flows, they've all had diagrams and things to do with min cuts and max flow and have traverse them in a way to figure out max flows, but I have no idea what the following task has to do with Network Flow.</p>  <p>Consider the Binary Magic Problem: Given a list of n integers r=(r1,..,rn) and a list of m integers c=(c1,..,cm), we ask whether there is an n*m grid of 0’ and 1’s such that row i sums to ri and column j sums to cj.</p>  <p>We assume Σri = Σcj .</p>  <p>n=m=3,with c=(1,2,0) and r=(1,1,1) answer is yes, but with r=(3,0,0) the answer is no.</p>  <p>Link to example (I don't have enough rep to post images): </p>  <p><a href="http://puu.sh/kx2lS/e559d5f275.png" rel="nofollow">http://puu.sh/kx2lS/e559d5f275.png</a></p>  <p>Use Network Flow to create an efficient algorithm to decide whether it is possible to design a 0/1 grid that obeys the given r and c sums.</p>  <p>How the f*** do i go about doing this?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>  <p>P.S. what is meant by "Σri = Σcj"?  I understand how the numbers around the outside of the tables referce to the listing of n and m integers and how there is a way to make the example tables using this info, but no idea what that sum means.</p>
