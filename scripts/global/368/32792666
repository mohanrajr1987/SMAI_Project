<p>We are covering two's complement bit representations binary multiplication and I am struggling to understand how to multiply two's complement binary numbers that are different bit lengths.</p>  <p>For example, 1011110B and 1010B. I know I need to sign extend the negative numbers but when I do this I don't get the correct answer.</p>  <p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!</p>
