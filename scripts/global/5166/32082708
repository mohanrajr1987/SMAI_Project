<p>I have a very strange problem with Aajx.BeginForm. I have this code :</p>  <p>In view :                  </p>  <pre><code>@using (Ajax.BeginForm("Upload", "Profile", new AjaxOptions() { HttpMethod = "POST" }, new { enctype = "multipart/form-data" }))     {         @Html.AntiForgeryToken()         &lt;input type="file" name="files"&gt;&lt;br&gt;         &lt;input type="submit" value="Upload File to Server"&gt;     } </code></pre>  <p>In controller :</p>  <pre><code>[HttpPost] [ValidateAntiForgeryToken] public void Upload(IEnumerable&lt;HttpPostedFileBase&gt; files) {     if (files != null)     {         foreach (var file in files)         {             // Verify that the user selected a file             if (file != null &amp;&amp; file.ContentLength &gt; 0)             {                 // extract only the fielname                 var fileName = Path.GetFileName(file.FileName);                 // TODO: need to define destination                 var path = Path.Combine(Server.MapPath("~/Upload"), fileName);                 file.SaveAs(path);             }         }     } } </code></pre>  <p>The problem is that I get null file when the form is submit. I read many question that is the same of my question, but most of the answers was that the name of input type="file" is not as the same name of the parameter name in the controller. I found some examples, I try <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19042116/ajax-beginform-in-mvc-to-upload-files/19044689#19044689">this one</a> which is almost the same of my code except for the jquery files, so I tried to replace the jquery files with these files :</p>  <pre><code>&lt;script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7/jquery.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script src="http://malsup.github.com/jquery.form.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; </code></pre>  <p>And here is the surprise !!. When the form is submit, I get the file but the form is post back. It is work as there is no ajax. I search in google for Ajax.BeginFrom that is post back and found many solutions in stackoverflow and most of of the answers was that <strong>jquery.unobtrusive-ajax</strong> file must be included in the page. It like a circle of problems, once you solve one you get another. Does I miss something ?</p>
