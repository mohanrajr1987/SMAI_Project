<p>There are a tonne of questions pertaining to <code>AjaxActionLink</code> and the overloads. I have been unable to find a question which resolves my problem. </p>  <p>I have the following CSHTML in my Razor view</p>  <pre><code> @Ajax.ActionLink(         "Clear Failed Entires",         "ClearFailedInviteEntries",         "Tools",          null,          new AjaxOptions { HttpMethod = "GET" },          new          {             onclick = "return confirm('Are you sure you want to clear the failed invite entries?');",             @class = "btn btn-lg btn-warning",             role = "button"          }) </code></pre>  <p>This fires the correct dialog with Okay and Cancel. However, when I press cancel the <code>ClearFailedInviteEntries</code> method still fires. I have attempted to put a check in this method</p>  <pre><code>[AllowAnonymous] public async Task&lt;ActionResult&gt; ClearFailedInviteEntries(string s) {     if (!ModelState.IsValid)         return null;     ... } </code></pre>  <p>But <code>ModelState.IsValid</code> is always true and this is consistent across browsers. I have heard that using <code>return confirm</code> can cause different behaviors so i have attempted to use <code>onclick = "confirm(...</code> instead with no change. </p>  <p>What am I doing wrong and how can I fix this? </p>  <p>Thanks for your time.</p>  <hr>  <p><em>Edit A. This is not an issue of the dialog <strong>not</strong> popping up. The dialog shows, but the selection in that dialog is not handled correctly.</em></p>  <p><em>Edit B. I have change the call to</em></p>  <pre><code> @Ajax.ActionLink(         "Clear Failed Entires",         "ClearFailedInviteEntries",         "Tools",          null,          new AjaxOptions           {              HttpMethod = "GET",               Confirm = "Are you sure you want to clear the failed invite entries?"          },          new          {             @class = "btn btn-lg btn-warning",             role = "button"          }) </code></pre>  <p><em>this works but now I get an odd check box on the dialog. How can i prevent/remove this?</em></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/tpvUV.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/tpvUV.png" alt="Dialog"></a></p>  <p>Ps.
