<p>I have ASP.NET(C#) web application which interacts with few external systems. Requests from external system (can be on different domain) can come to my web app. So I had Access-Control-Allow-Origin = * in my web.config. Since giving * is security threat, I need to restrict the same to few domains dynamically. As I understand we can't give multiple domains in web.config for Access-Control-Allow-Origin. So I looked at solution where you get the "Origin" header and then set  Access-Control-Allow-Origin accordingly. Please note: Requests coming from external systems are not AJAX. They can be simple GET Calls. I have below code in </p>  <pre><code>public void ProcessRequestBasedOnOrigin(HttpContext context)         {             List&lt;string&gt; allowedOrigins = new List&lt;string&gt;();             allowedOrigins.Add("abc.com");             allowedOrigins.Add("xyz.com");              string origin = context.Request.Headers.Get("Origin");             if (allowedOrigins.Contains(origin))                 context.Response.AppendHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", origin);          } </code></pre>  <p>But the problem is I am getting "origin" as null. Am I doing anything wrong here?</p>
