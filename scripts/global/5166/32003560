<p>I wrote an ajax method in an asp.net(c#) webpage(below).  But it is not working as expected.  when I'm doing a button click my method(code-behind) was not being called and whole webpage is returned as response.</p>  <p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false"> <div class="snippet-code"> <pre class="snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override"><code> $('#btnLoad').click(function () {                      $.ajax({                         url: "LandingPage.aspx/getResults",                         type: 'GET',                         dataType: 'json',                         success: function (data) {                              					//logic....                             })                         },                         error: function (xhr) {                             var temp = xhr.responseText;                         }                     })                  })</code></pre> </div> </div> </p>  <p>my C# method</p>  <pre><code>[WebMethod()] public static string getResults() {     // logic.....     return JsonConvert.SerializeObject(dt); } </code></pre>  <p>But when I made some changes to the above method ; changed 'GET' to 'POST' and added a property <code>contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8"</code>. It worked  and now my static (c#) method is being invoked and gettign 'json' response.</p>  <p>I have no idea how this is working. As I expected a GET request should simply do the task which is not happening. Can anyone explain me pls why ?</p>
