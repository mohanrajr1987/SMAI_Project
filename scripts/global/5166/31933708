<p>Requirement: From my MVC application, I have to call an external api using post method &amp; pass header parameters &amp; it will return me with a json object.</p>  <p><a href="https://www.hurl.it/" rel="nofollow">Hurl.it</a> allows me to check if my service is working fine &amp; it is working fine.</p>  <p>Since i am new to C# &amp; .NET, i don't know how to connect to this external api. </p>  <p>I have tried with HTTPWebRequest, WebRequest, HTTPClient &amp; all other stuff which i found on internet but i am not able to connect to the service.</p>  <p>If you don't understand the requirement, ask me questions so i will update this post.</p>
