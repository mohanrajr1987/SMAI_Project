<p>A little background....I have sent an AJAX request to the WebServer which kicks off a long running asynchronous job on the web server in another process. Once the job is completed on the WebServer, the cache object is updated to reflect the success/failure of the job that was submitted. I need to perform certain action on  the browser, when the job execution is completed. Is there a way to keep pinging the server periodically until the job is completed? Can I use setTimeOut function in Javascript to achieve this?</p>  <p>Thank you so much in advance.</p>
