<p>I'm wondering how to apply <code>chosen</code> to multi-select drop-down in <code>jtable</code>. I've tried adding <code>chosen-select</code> as <code>class</code> but its not working. I've tried <code>ajaxComplete</code> also to check whether it might not be working because of <code>ajax completion</code> but it didn't help.</p>  <p>Here's my code:</p>  <pre><code> $(document).ajaxComplete(function () {     $(".chosen-select").chosen();  }); //post ajax </code></pre>  <p>Also I've tried with <code>data-rel="chosen"</code> to in <code>jquery.jtable.js</code>, but it didn't help either. The multi-select list is coming but the problem is I have to show over 3500 locations in the list and it would become difficult to scroll and search locations, so that's why I want to use <code>chosen</code> so that I can search in the text box which it suggests and one can easily select, and delete locations. I've tried posting images but reputation prevented me from doing that.</p>
