<p>I have a page having a TextArea(HTML) and Post Button(HTML) just bellow that Textarea. On the click of that button I am calling $.ajax() method by which I am calling an appropiate controller action method.There is a  uploader just above the Post Button from where user can upload any file &amp; that file is uploaded to the server by using FormData() class object.The whole flow ofthe code is as follows</p>  <ol> <li>User enters the text in textarea</li> <li>Upload an attachment file(if required)</li> <li>Then Click on the Post Button</li> <li>A Javascript function is called who then uses FormData() to upload a file with particular key name</li> <li>$.ajax() method is called and it calls controller's action method where I store the file in Session</li> <li>Then again I call $.ajax() which calls controller's another action method which is responsible for adding the text to the database and in this method I retrive file from Session which I store in step 5.</li> </ol>  <p>Now the problem is that sometimes action method of step 5 is not called due to which I don't get any attachment file in step 6 action method. Though out of 10 times it is happening 1 time that I post a text with an attachment and that text comes without attachment.Previously I thought there is some caching issue so I decorate the controller's action method with [OutputCacheAttribute(VaryByParam = "*", Duration = 0, NoStore = true)] the scenerio happens in this way Suppose I have posted following 7 text</p>  <ol> <li>Com1 (With Attachment File “List of UI &amp; Database Objects”)(Uploaded Successfully)</li> <li>Com2(Without Attachment) (Uploaded Successfully)</li> <li>Com3(With Attachment File “List of UI &amp; Database Objects”) ”)(Uploaded Successfully)</li> <li>Com4(Without Attachment) ”)(Uploaded Successfully) </li> <li>Com5(With Attachment File “List of UI &amp; Database Objects”)(Uploaded But Attachment Is Absent)</li> <li>Com6(With Attachment File “List of UI &amp; Database Objects”)(Uploaded Successfully)</li> <li>Com7(With Attachment File “List of UI &amp; Database Objects”)(Uploaded Successfully)</li> </ol>  <p>Here Com5 is not uploaded with attachment rest all the comments are uploaded</p>  <p>With Warm Regards Piyush Maitrey</p>
