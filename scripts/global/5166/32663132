<p>I'm using ASP.NET MVC 5 &amp; C#. Basically when I click a button on my website, it should generate a report in async manner. Generating report takes ~10 minutes.  Also while the report is being generated asynchronously, I need to be able to keep on using other area of the website.</p>  <p>So I have mainly below look alike ajax request that I call on generate report button click. I also have my async action method in place properly. If I hit the generate report button then it starts processing it and display "Report generated!" once the report is generated (like in 10 minutes).</p>  <p>That's fine. But after clicking the button, if I try to access any other area on the website (like clicking on other tab/button/etc) then it immediately displays me the error message "An error occurred!", which is coming from ajax error section - See below code.  Also it completes the report generation asynchronously fine. But it just shows me the error message right after I hit the button!</p>  <p>This seems weird to me. Please guide me as what's happening here and help me to fix this. Thanks.</p>  <pre><code>$.ajax({   type: "POST",   url: url,   data: data,   success: function(html){     alert("Report generated!");   },   error: function(e) {      alert("An error occurred!");      } }); </code></pre>
