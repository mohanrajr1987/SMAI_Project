<p>So I'm trying to copy a backup of the data from my app. I wrote the batch script below to do this, but the script takes forever to run. </p>  <p>I start the batch script at 1am, and it is still running at 8:30am. This seems weird to me because when I copy the backup of my app manually in Windows File Explorer, it copies in 7-15 minutes depending on network traffic.</p>  <p>I <code>REM</code> the <code>%backupcmd% "C:\Program Files\App\App Server\Data\Backups" "%drive%\"</code> line. That was the original line of batch script I used to backup the data, and it worked efficiently up till a month ago. </p>  <p>So I tried the <code>xcopy</code> command with <code>/d</code>, so it would only copy source files that have been changed on or after that date (the current date), and the backups I'm copying are made at 12:01am every night and the copy backup script starts at 1am. </p>  <p>Any advice as to how to speed up my <code>xcopy</code> would be appreciated. If you think I should use <code>powershell</code> for this task too, I'm open to that option as well. </p>  <pre><code>@echo off for /F "usebackq tokens=1,2 delims==" %%i in (`wmic os get LocalDateTime /VALUE 2^&gt;NUL`) do if '.%%i.'=='.LocalDateTime.' set ldt=%%j set yyyy=%ldt:~0,4% set mm=%ldt:~4,2% set dd=%ldt:~6,2%  :: variables set drive=Z:\RootSoft\App\Data Backups set backupcmd=xcopy /s /c /d /e /h /i /r /y /f /z  echo ### Backing up Backup...
