<p><br> Hi there <br> I am trying to sign my unsigned .apk file without prompting the password. <br> The android build is local on phonegap/cordova via cli/powershell.<br> The signing-step should be done with jarsigner via cli too.Unfortunately there is no official option to do it without prompting the password or i just cant find it.<br> Does anybody know how to do it?  <br> Thanks in advance :-)</p>
