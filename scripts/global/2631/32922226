<p>I have multiple audio tracks and subtitles to extract in a single <em>.mkv</em> file. I'm new to <code>ffmpeg</code> commands, this is what I've tried (audio):</p>  <p><code>ffmpeg -i VIDEO.mkv -vn -acodec copy AUDIO.aac</code></p>  <p>It just extract 1 audio. What I want is tell <code>ffmpeg</code> to extract every single audio files and subtitle files to a destination, and keep the original name of each files and extensions. (Because I don't know which extension does the audio files are, sometimes maybe <em>.flac</em> or <em>.aac</em>). <br><br> I'm not sure about the solutions I'd found online, because it's quite complicated, and I need explanations to know how it's works, so that I can manipulate the command in the future. By the way, I planned to run the code from Windows CMD.<br><br> Thanks.</p>
