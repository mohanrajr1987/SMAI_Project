<p>I'm currently trying to find out if .NET 4.0 is installed on different PC via command-line. The command I'm using is:</p>  <pre><code>REG QUERY "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\NET Framework Setup\NDP\v4\Full" /v Version </code></pre>  <p>If 4.0 is installed I get 4.0..... as a result while if nothing is installed at all I get a registry key error.</p>  <p>Now my question is (as I can't reproduce it here):</p>  <p>Is that secure enough, or could I run into troubles in case 2.0 is installed or 3.0 but NOT 4.0? Thus would I still get the registry key not found error or would I have to use something different here?</p>
