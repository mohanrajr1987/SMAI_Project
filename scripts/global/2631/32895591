<p>Is there a way to tell if a folder is shared For example I have folder D:/data1 I would like to know if it is shared or if is not.<br /> Is this possible to do with golang or CMD commands? Is there a example on how to do this?<br /> My goal is to be able to pass in a root folder D:/data2 and tell if is a shared folder. <br /> Example of what i would like to do. </p>  <pre><code>if shared("D:/data2") {  //handle if it is shared } else {  //handle not shared folder } </code></pre>  <p>I just have not bin able to find a way to detect if the folder is shared. Thank you for your help!</p>
