<p>I am keep getting this error message when I run "meteor" on cmd on windows. </p>  <pre><code>Unexpected mongo exit code 100. Restarting. Unexpected mongo exit code 100. Restarting. Unexpected mongo exit code 100. Restarting. Can't start Mongo server. MongoDB had an unspecified uncaught expection. This can be caused by MongoDB being unable to write to a local database.  Check that you have permissions to write to .meteor/local. mongoDB does not support filesystems like NFS that do not allow file locking. </code></pre>  <p>This happens right after I downloaded meteor and created my first project. I already tried resetting the project. I saw people recommend removing the lock file in db folder. However, when I check <code>.meteor/local/db</code>, its empty. </p>
