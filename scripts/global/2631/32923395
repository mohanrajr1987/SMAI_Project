<p>There is a problem in my code that works in locally but when uploaded in remote gets into hang state. And when it remote is called on another tab, it shows hang on that too. So to get rid of it I have to restart the browser.</p>  <p>The php code is </p>  <pre><code>passthru('php -q ../class/file.php -u1234567890'); </code></pre>  <p>The file.php file contains a code of inserting into database with heavy load. So I also need it to work on backend with no return and thus early execution.</p>
