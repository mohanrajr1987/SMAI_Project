<pre><code>wmic product get name,version &gt; "C:\myInformation.txt" ECHO.  &gt;&gt; "C:\myInformation.txt" ECHO %username% &gt;&gt; "C:\myInformation.txt" </code></pre>  <p>I'm trying to write a batch file that will generate the software installed on the users computer as well as get their username for id purposes.  The code above works individually. However, when I try to write out to the file, I get <code>†਍敨瑣牯洮牡楴敮⁺਍</code> instead of "<code>john.doe</code>"</p>  <p>My question is, how can I get the software dump from <code>wmic</code> followed by the username without it spitting out garbage.  I've flipped the order of commands. Doing so results in getting the username but not the software, in a neat output any ways. </p>  <p>Creating two files is not really something I want to do. I'd like one file per user. </p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
