<p>I am using the following command to move files from source to destination:</p>  <pre><code>move c:\src\* c:\dst </code></pre>  <p>This works when there are files in <code>src</code> but gives the following error message when the directory is empty:</p>  <pre><code>The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect. </code></pre>  <p>How can I suppress this error? This is a cosmetic/management/UX issue, as if there are no files to move then I don't need to take any further action.</p>
