<p>By using python, how do I use cmd.exe supported commands and get the output to be viewed back in python? The reason I am doing this is to get the Microsoft .NET framework version. At the moment I could only find it through the cmd.exe by using the following command:</p>  <pre><code>wmic product where "Name like 'Microsoft .Net%'" get Name, Version </code></pre>  <p>So I was thinking to get python to execute the above command and get the results back and write them to a file.</p>
