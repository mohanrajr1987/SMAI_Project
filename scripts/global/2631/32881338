<p>when i'm running the command "tasklist.exe" in the Kudu Web Frontend CMD it returns nothing, it seems that the process is hanging.</p>  <p>We need this command in our web application. Does anyone can confirm this or has a resolution ?</p>  <p>Our application runs on node.js (for information)</p>  <p>Image: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ffPIS.png" rel="nofollow">http://i.stack.imgur.com/ffPIS.png</a></p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
