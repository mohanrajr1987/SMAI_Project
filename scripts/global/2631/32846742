<p>I have a text file containing file names and the path where they are intended to go, delimited by a comma. I need to create a batch file to search one directory for the files, and copy them to their respective destinations.</p>  <p>The text file looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>12345.pdf, C:\SomeDirectory\1  54321.pdf, C:\SomeDirectory\2 67891.pdf, C:\SomeDirectory\3 </code></pre>  <p>The pdf files are all in a single folder with no subdirectories. The command would pick up the file names before the comma, find the files in the source, and copy them to the path stated after the comma on the same line in the text file.</p>  <p>I am assuming PowerShell would also be an option.</p>  <p>Here is what I have tried:</p>  <pre><code>FOR /F  "tokens=1,2" delims =," %%G IN (PDF_MISSING.txt) DO @echo copy /Y "W:\GasImages\ServiceCards\All_PDF\%%G" "%%H" </code></pre>  <p>Also:</p>  <pre><code>FOR /F  "tokens=1,2" delims =," %%G IN (PDF_MISSING.txt) DO @echo copy /Y "W:\GasImages\ServiceCards\All_PDF\%%G" "%%H" </code></pre>  <p>Both of these return "The syntax of the command is incorrect"</p>
