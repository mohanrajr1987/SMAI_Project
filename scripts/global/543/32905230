<p>I have multiple functions which return a list of words (each function contains words that start with the same letter):</p>  <pre><code>def get_a():     #  ..some code     return words_a  # words_a contain a list with some words that begin with a   ... # and so on  def get_y():     #  ..some code     return words_y  # words_y contain a list with some words that begin with y  </code></pre>  <p>Output example: <code>['yahoo', 'yep', 'yellow']</code></p>  <p>Now, I have a random word ( I know its <code>len</code> and only some letters which are located at specific indexes - I also know these )</p>  <p>Supposing that I have the following <code>partial_word</code> (I have <code>0</code> instead of the empty spaces):</p>  <p><code>partial_word = 00LL0W</code></p>  <p>What is the best way of getting a list with words(from all my functions) that will satisfy the following condition:</p>  <ul> <li>all known index letters(in my example <code>L(position2) L(position3) W(position5</code>) from the <code>partial_word</code> will match at the exact same positions the letters from the words from my functions ?</li> <li>another important detail is that each function returns a list with 3-4k words.</li> </ul>
