<p>I have modal box in which I add content to this box via AJAX ( data from database ), but here is a problem. This content is loaded very slowly. It happened that i open modal and after 4 or 5 sec appears a content.</p>  <p>I set  content like this :</p>  <pre><code>$("#someIdInModal").html(""+dataFromDatabase); </code></pre>  <p>So how you think where is problem ? I need to buy better server? xD or there is some faster method than this?</p>
