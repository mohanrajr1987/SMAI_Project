<p>I built a site a while ago without the expectation of it being used a huge amount.</p>  <p>As it transpires It is being used a lot now and I am running into slowness issues with a page where I am loading a tag cloud.  The page with this on is taking over 30s to load now.</p>  <p>Within the database I am logging searches which now number over 1 million.  I am using a query as below and I dont know id this is the culprit:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT tfml_food, LOWER(tfml_food), COUNT(*) as number_of_times         FROM tbl_fm_log          WHERE tfml_food != ""         GROUP BY (tfml_food) having count(*) &gt; 200 </code></pre>  <p>Is there any way that I can optimise this query?  Is it really as bad as slowing it down that much?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
