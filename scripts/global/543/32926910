<p>I'm trying to use this php script for image-optimization: <a href="https://github.com/psliwa/image-optimizer" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/psliwa/image-optimizer</a></p>  <p>But I think that the documentation is very poor, this is all what it says:</p>  <pre><code>$factory = new \ImageOptimizer\OptimizerFactory(); $optimizer = $factory-&gt;get();  $filepath = /* path to image */;  $optimizer-&gt;optimize($filepath); </code></pre>  <p>But I really don't understand this way of calling a class with "new \" and get this error when I copy that code: Fatal error: Class 'ImageOptimizer\OptimizerFactory' not found in... What is my mistake?</p>
