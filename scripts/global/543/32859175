<p>I have a noisy image Y and known kernel H. I need to estimate a denoised image X such that it gradient of X is also minimised.</p>  <p>J= ||Y-HX||^2+ Alpha* Smoothness constraint(X);</p>  <p>Smoothness constraint=  L1norm(|| Grad(X) ||)</p>  <p>how do i estimate the gradient of second term involving smoothness.</p>  <p>Help me on understanding the update rule for x; I only know the gradient for first term.</p>
