<pre><code>$full_str = &lt;img class="label" title="input contactusform email" id="label_contactusform_email" alt="this is alt tag"&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I have this string expression and need to fetch title and alt tag value </p>  <pre><code>$exploded_part = explode('="', $full_str); $title_text = $exploded_part[2];  // it also included '" id' so need to explode again  $title_revised = explode('"', $title_text); $actual_title = $title_revised[0];  $alt_text = $exploded_part[4];  // it also included '"&gt;' so need to explode again  $alt_revised = explode('"', $alt_text);  $actual_alt = $alt_revised[0]; </code></pre>  <p>I have read using explode takes so much resources and affects the performance and in this code have to use multiple times. Any ideas suggestions I can make this code better and use some other options except explode.</p>  <p>Edited: When I am using the below expression at that time it is not actually the part of DOM it's only a part of an array value and I have to put the fetched alt and title tags in the element to be part of DOM. I hope it makes sense.</p>
