<p>I am trying to make a matrix (currently as a table) in which I have constant values and values depending on a decision variables defined later. It kind looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>table g(i,j) limits      1    2 1    1    0.5*x("1",j) 2    1    0.5*x("2",j); </code></pre>  <p>positive variables <br> <code>x(i, j)</code> number of workers in skill level <code>i</code> in period  <code>j</code> <br> <code>t(i, j)</code> number of retraining of worker in skill level <code>i</code> period <code>j</code></p>  <p>equations <br></p>  <pre><code>t(i, j) =L= g(i,j) </code></pre>  <p>Now obviously this doesn't work and I can't figure out a solution how to do it. Is there actually a way to use decision variables in such a way in gams? In principle, I just want to make a nice matrix in which I can store them for later use in the equations. </p>  <p>Hope that anyone can help me.</p>
