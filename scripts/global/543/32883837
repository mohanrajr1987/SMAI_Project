<p>According to this <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/sql/11g-sqlplanmanagement-101938.html" rel="nofollow">Oracle documentation</a>, I can assume that the Optimizer postpones the hard parse and it doesn't generate an execution plan until the first time a prepared statement is executed:</p>  <p>"The answer is a phenomenon called bind peeking. Earlier, when you ran that query with the bind variable value set to 'NY', the optimizer had to do a hard parse for the first time and while doing so it peeked at the bind variable to see what value had been assigned to it."</p>  <p>But when executing an EXPLAIN PLAN for a prepared statement with bind parameters, we get an executed plan. On his site, <a href="http://use-the-index-luke.com/sql/where-clause/bind-parameters" rel="nofollow">Markus Winand</a> says that:</p>  <p>"When using bind parameters, the optimizer has no concrete values available to determine their frequency. It then just assumes an equal distribution and always gets the same row count estimates and cost values. In the end, it will always select the same execution plan."</p>  <p>Which one is true? Does an execution plan get generated when the statement is prepared using an evenly distribution value model, or is the hard parsing postponed until the first execution time. </p>
