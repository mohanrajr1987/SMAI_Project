<p>I have this double loop working:</p>  <pre><code>for (i in 1:nrow(doe)) {   for (j in 1:nrow(rsm)) {     if (rsm[j,2] == doe[i,2] &amp; rsm[j,3] == doe[i,3] &amp; rsm[j,4] == doe[i,4]) {       out &lt;- cbind(doe[i,6], rsm[j,6])       matching_out &lt;- rbind(matching_out, out)       break     }   } } </code></pre>  <p>As you can see, I have to match three columns together in two dataset (# 2, 3, 4 in this case), and then <code>cbind</code> column 6 of the two data frame in another one.</p>  <p>The question is: since this is quite slow, how can I optimise it?  I suppose I could use an <code>apply</code>-like approach, but I can't figure out.</p>
