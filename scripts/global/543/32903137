<p>I have a data frame consisting of names of preprocessing methods.</p>  <pre><code>*Impute*    *Scale*       naomit      noscale       knnimpute   noscale               naomit      scale         knnimpute   scale      </code></pre>  <p>In step one function g() executes the methods row-wise to create a preprocessed data set. For first row: identity(na.omit(data))</p>  <p>In step two classification error in computed for each preprocessed data set. The objective is to find a combination that minimizes classification error. </p>  <p>There are thousands of combinations. Currently, I use full blind or simple grid search. I need a more intelligent method to find preprocessed data sets worth testing.</p>  <p>I know there is the CRAN task view for optimization and I have tried to learn conceptual  issues from here (<a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=937505" rel="nofollow">http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=937505</a>).</p>  <p>What would be a good R combinatorial optimization package/ function to find approximately  best solution faster with mimimal up-front work?</p>
