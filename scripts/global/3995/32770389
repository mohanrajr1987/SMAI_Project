<p>Nowadays, APIs such as ThingSpeak allow people to GET/POST values from/to IoT devices. I'm looking for a way to parse and read a number which is published in an authenticated webpage. In the researches that I made, I thought that would be possible. The application called ThingHTTP has appropriate setting fields, it even asks for the username/password couple required for the web page. Pure HTML page it can read the value easily when the XPath is given. But in this example I could not get the result that I needed but an error "Error parsing document, try a different parse string." What I need is to get a numerical value in the paragraph highlighted in the screenshot below. It would be better if somebody can show me a manual way to do this without using any API. <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ntCog.png" rel="nofollow">Screenshot</a></p>
