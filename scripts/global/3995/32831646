<p>I have a set of links that looks like the following:</p>  <pre><code>links = ['http://www.website.com/category/subcategory/1', 'http://www.website.com/category/subcategory/2', 'http://www.website.com/category/subcategory/3',...] </code></pre>  <p>I want to extract the <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>, and so on from this list, and store the extracted data in <code>subcategory_explicit</code>. They're stored as <code>str</code>, and I'm having trouble getting at them with the following code:</p>  <pre><code>subcategory_explicit = [cat.get('subcategory') for cat in links if cat.get('subcategory') is not None] </code></pre>  <p>Do I have to change my data type from <code>str</code> to something else? What would be a better way to obtain and store the extracted values?</p>
