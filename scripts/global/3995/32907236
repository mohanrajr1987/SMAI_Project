<p>I'd like to reach directly a certain view of a webpage which needs a couple of clicks. Is there a way to "create" a GET URL (i.e. site.com/demo_form.asp?name1=value1&amp;name2=value2) if certain variables are not currently present?</p>  <p>Practical example: I'd like a direct URL to access the view that I get by clicking on <a href="http://techcrunch.com/search/crunchweek#stq=crunchweek&amp;stp=1" rel="nofollow">http://techcrunch.com/search/crunchweek#stq=crunchweek&amp;stp=1</a> then clicking on the left to "past week" and on the top on "LATEST".</p>  <p>Is there a URL for that?</p>  <p>thank you</p>
