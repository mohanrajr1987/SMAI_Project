<p>In PHP or JS, I'm interested in having a visitor fill out a form selecting a category of information, and then select multiple checkboxes identifying sub-topics.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;form id="moreInfoSection" method="get" action="/custom-solutions/"&gt;   &lt;div class="container"&gt;     &lt;select name="category"&gt;       &lt;option value="cat1"&gt;Option 1&lt;/option&gt;       &lt;option value="cat2"&gt;Option 2&lt;/option&gt;     &lt;/select&gt;&lt;br&gt;     &lt;input type="checkbox" name="cID[]" value="1"&gt;Checkbox 1&lt;br&gt;     &lt;input type="checkbox" name="cID[]" value="2"&gt;Checkbox 2&lt;br&gt;     &lt;input type="checkbox" name="cID[]" value="3"&gt;Checkbox 3&lt;br&gt;     &lt;input class="button" type="submit" id="SubmitButton" name="submit" value="Submit"/&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/form&gt; </code></pre>  <p>On submission I want to take them to another page in which they are presented content on their topic, and content for each sub-topic.  I will need this new page to be bookmark-able and shareable.<br><br> My question is, what is a simple way to accomplish this goal?<br> I've considered delivering the information via a GET method, but it seems the url could quickly become bloated.  In this solution there's also a question of how to parse the url with multiple checkboxes potentially named the same with different values.<br><br> Is there any other common solutions to this request that I've overlooked?</p>
