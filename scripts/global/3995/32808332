<p>I am developing an Android application in which I am trying to send a simple array as a URL parameter, but it is not working properly. I am using a HTTP client and GET method. I have tried this in the following way:</p>  <pre><code>StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();  sb.append(URLEncoder.encode(e.getKey(), "UTF-8")).append('=').append(URLEncoder.encode(e.getValue()+"", "UTF-8")); where e.getValue() is ArrayList&lt;Integers&gt; </code></pre>  <p>My URL params are appended <code>%5B28%5D</code> when I am sending <code>[28]</code>. If I don't use URL encoder then it goes as <code>[28]</code> But I want to use URL encoder. Am I doing anything wrong?</p>
