<p>In my chrome extension i used jquery library and this is my post ajax request but i am confuse is it synchronous request or asynchronous ?</p>  <pre><code>  $.ajax({             type: 'POST',             url: "https://api.xxx",             data: { domain: b },             cache: false,             success: function (data)             {                 var response = JSON.parse(data);                 .......                 if ()                  {                  }                 else                 {                  }             },             error: function (data)             {                 $('.popup').html("test");             }         });         return $ret;     } </code></pre>  <p>if it is synchronous is it enough to add </p>  <pre><code>async:true </code></pre>  <p>to make it asynchronous?</p>  <p>NB: I have another GET request. thing is POST request is working pretty fine but during get request the response is really slow sometimes i had to make several click or reload to make it work.</p>
