<p>Is it wrong way to pass $_GET variable in MVC design?</p>  <pre><code>http://localhost/video?id=123 </code></pre>  <p>I started to learn MCV design pattern and some people were telling me, that I'm doing wrong. The correct way would be:</p>  <pre><code>http://localhost/video/?id=123 </code></pre>  <p>They were saying its kinda of 'standard' for passing $_GET in MVC. The slash isnt needed only if you access file directly, like:</p>  <pre><code>http://localhost/video.php?id=123 </code></pre>
