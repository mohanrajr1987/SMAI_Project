<p>My goal is: I have an <code>/edit</code> action in my Yii project containing some form with fields let's say:<code>text</code>, <code>image</code>. There are some values entered to these forms (let's say 'my text' and 'my image').</p>  <p>I have a button Save (we don't use it) and a button which directs me to action <code>/preview</code>, and I need to pass there an array like <code>['text' =&gt; 'my text', 'image' =&gt; 'my image']</code> or the same as an object. </p>  <p>Can I even do this without submitting the form? I thought about javascript, but is there some way to avoid using it?</p>
