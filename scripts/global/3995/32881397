<p>I am developing a mobile application that calls a RESTFul web service to retrieve information from my database. The purpose is to support offline mode where POST requests would be sent when the user goes online and sync the database accordingly. I am able to sync the local updates to the database successfully, however, when I make edits to the database itself, it does not get reflected locally.</p>  <p>I realized the problem is that my GET request might be cached and saves the old value without updating it.</p>  <p>E.G localhost:port/myapp/query/MyTable returns a list of values initially, but when i change the values in the database, the GET request still returns the initial value no matter what I do (even clearing the cache). Is there any reason for this?</p>
