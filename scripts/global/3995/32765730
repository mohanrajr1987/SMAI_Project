<p>Is there a method similar to PHP's GET for bash scripts?</p>  <p>This is what I'm trying to do...</p>  <p>PHP file sets a variable and executes a remote bash script, the variable gets passed and is used in the bash script. </p>  <p>So this is my PHP script...</p>  <pre><code> &lt;?php  $myvar = 'hello world';   $connection = ssh2_connect('example.com', 22);  ssh2_auth_password($connection, 'username', 'password');   $stream = ssh2_exec($connection, '/usr/incoming/myscript.sh');  ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>And this is myscript.sh on the remote machine...</p>  <pre><code> #!/bin/bash            echo $myvar </code></pre>  <p>Of course this isn't working because I'm not sure how to pass $myvar from the PHP file to myscript.sh </p>  <p>I know with PHP this is done using GET but how do I do this in this situation?</p>
