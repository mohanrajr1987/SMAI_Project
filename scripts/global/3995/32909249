<p>I want to gather a list of courses in which a specific user is enrolled, but for the current semester. All I've found so far is how to get <em>every</em> course the user has ever been enrolled in. Is there something along the lines of: <code>/d2l/api/lp/1.0/enrollments/users/(userId)/orgUnits/(semesterId)</code> ?</p>  <p>If anyone has any advice, I'd greatly appreciate it!!!</p>  <p>Thanks in advance,</p>  <p>-- Valence Newbie</p>
