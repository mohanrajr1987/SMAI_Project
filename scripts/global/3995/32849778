<p>I have this very weird error. </p>  <p>Whenever I attempt to use a form on this particular call, it will automatically do a Moved Permanently 301 call to the exact same page as GET. I'm not sure what is causing this but I'm guessing this is something with how Laravel handles URLs.</p>  <p>For example I have:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php echo Form::open(array('url' =&gt;  'storage/remove/?page=' . $page)) ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Where $page is a _GET variable. </p>  <p>When I run this page in FireBug, I see that it always tries to redirect it to a GET page. </p>  <p>My routes:</p>  <pre><code>Route::any("storage/{id?}", array("uses" =&gt; "StorageController@index", "before" =&gt; array("auth", "maintenance_check"))); Route::post("storage/remove", array("uses" =&gt; "StorageController@remove", "before" =&gt; array("auth", "csrf_check", "maintenance_check"))); </code></pre>  <p>Can someone let me know what I'm doing wrong for this issue?</p>
