<p>I have build a Joomla module for handling iDeal donations (payments) through a Payment Service Provider (Buckaroo). Making donations works great but after making a donation the customer is sent to a default page depending on the status (succes/fail) of their donation.</p>  <p>Buckaroo has the option to send out a Push response (GET) after each donation, containing details like status, amount, etc. Now I would like to get these variables and use them in a Generic page so I can send the customer an email thanking him/her if the status of the donation is 'Succes'.</p>  <p>Is it possibile to set up this generic page in the same module I have build to make a donation? And if so, can I use the default.php page to handle this or should I create a new page? </p>  <p>I hope someone can give me a hint or some inspiration to get this working. Cause though I can find enough documentation on getting vars from a Push notification. I can't seem to find any documentation on how to handle this within the same module. Or if this is even possible.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>  <p>Eelco</p>
