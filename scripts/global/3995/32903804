<p>I've a problem with a view. This uses two GET methods for two recovery fields and doesn't work, Django always says the view didn't return a HttpResponse objects. I also put two additional Breakpoints (BP1 and BP2, redirecting for more created views) for see where the code is failing, but it doesn't work either. At first the view code seems right, but I don't find where's the problem; anybody can help me?</p>  <p>Here's the view for more info: </p>  <pre><code>def password_recovery(request):      if 'email' in request.GET:         q1 = request.GET['email']     else:         q1 = None      if 'dni' in request.GET:         q2 = request.GET['dni']     else:         q2 = None      if not q1 or not q2:         return HttpResponseRedirect(reverse('BP1'))     else:         us = UserProfile.objects.filter(email=q1, dni=q2)         if not us:             return HttpResponseRedirect(reverse('BP2'))         else:             subject = 'Clave de acceso. Recordatorio'             message = "Hola, %(name)s. Tu clave de acceso es %(pwd)s" % {'name': us.first_name,                                                                                        'pwd': us.password}             send_mail(subject, message, 'staff@quaba.com', [us.email], fail_silently=False)             return HttpResponseRedirect(reverse('BP3')) return render_to_response('sn/recovery.html',                              context_instance=RequestContext(request)) </code></pre>
