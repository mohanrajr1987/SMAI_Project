<p>i'm trying to get some text files from the web using python. most of this have been downloaded correctly but few not. i've tested few solutions eg.wget,urllib.urlopen, urllib.urlretrive and some another. for example file from below urlpath : <a href="http://bossa.pl/pub/metastock/mstock/sesjaall/20150918.prn" rel="nofollow">http://bossa.pl/pub/metastock/mstock/sesjaall/20150918.prn</a> this file has been downloaded as a binary file, but this is simple ascii file. is there a solution to download all these files as ascii text files? or convert it to ascii ?</p>  <p>my code to do this :</p>  <blockquote> <pre><code>  response = urllib.urlopen(url + filename)     print "downloading " + url+filename     with open(destDir+"/"+filename, "wb") as local_file:       local_file.write(response.read()) </code></pre> </blockquote>
