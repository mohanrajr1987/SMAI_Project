<p>On account of defining my own schema,I applied for OIDs on IANA website. Soon I received  Pen System Response email, and I confirmed my submission for a Private Enterprise Number.</p>  <p>I wonder how long will I get the OID. It's already 7 hours since my application. Or is there any one give me an surplus OID?</p>
