<p>Please excuse me as i am new to LDAP authentication. I have a web application and the users are allowed to login into the application by using LDAP. A very basic modal pops up when user goes through the login page. this modal shows username and password to enter. If i enter the regular desktop credentials, i am allowed to login. </p>  <p>So, here is my query. the modal which shows username and password field is very basic. I need to create a nice UI showing the user to enter credentials.  I am planning to use Angular or Jquery to create a nice UI instead of the one which is currently displayed</p>  <p>how can i go about with it ? i guess it is showing me the default here. can i custom it and beautify it ??  Could anyone please suggest some ideas as to how to get it going. Thanks </p>  <p><img src="http://techencoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/iis-authentiction-required.png" alt="a login"></p>
