<p>I have a question about LDAP search in AD with perl's Net::LDAP modul.</p>  <p>Simply I want to get all members in all (!) groups. It's work fine, but the "member"-attribute contain DN's of Users. What must I do, to get sAMAccountName of this users in the same query? So, I want to say in may LDAP query to AD Server: "please translate DN to sAMAccountName for all this members and get me this values back in member-attribute".</p>  <p>I think, I must use IADsNameTranslate interface (<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Aa706046.aspx" rel="nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Aa706046.aspx</a>) or/and  LDAP_MATCHING_RULE_IN_CHAIN, right?</p>  <p>But how I can do it with Perl?</p>  <p>Or I must work with "deref" - setting of "search"-method in Net::LDAP?</p>  <p>Here is my code:</p>  <pre><code>my $base = "OU=yy,dc=xx,dc=zz"; my $scope = 'sub'; my $filter = "(&amp;(objectclass=group)(objectCategory=group)(|(groupType=2)(groupType=8)))"; my @attrs = [ "name", "mail", "member" ];  my $results = $ldap-&gt;search( base =&gt; $base, filter =&gt; $filter, attrs =&gt; @attrs, scope =&gt; $scope ); </code></pre>
