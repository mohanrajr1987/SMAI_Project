<p>I'm new to LDAP and ldapJS. I read some stackoverflow posts, but still puzzling with probably very simple problem.</p>  <p>I just want to use ldapjs for the authentication on a nodejs app.</p>  <p>I got from our admins following connection data:</p>  <ul> <li><p>Host: ldap.server:389</p></li> <li><p>Protocol: LDAP v3</p></li> <li><p>Base DN: cn=Users, DC=something, DC=com</p></li> <li><p>Admin user DN: admin@something.com</p></li> <li><p>Admin user password: justpwd</p></li> </ul>  <p>I could connect in ApacheDirectoryStudio with these connection data.</p>  <p>Now I want to use ldapjs, to connect to the ldap server and check if user exists and password is correct</p>  <p>First I have probably to create a client. This seems to be easy</p>  <pre><code>var ldap = require('ldapjs'); var client = ldap.createClient({     url: 'ldap.server:389' }); </code></pre>  <p>But then I'm lost. </p>  <p>What should be next steps and how / where to use credentials I've got from admins within ldapjs?</p>  <p>How to check if user exists and password is correct?</p>  <p>My plan would be to bind first and then to search. I found this answer <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/17418292/408780">http://stackoverflow.com/a/17418292/408780</a> but somehow I still missing some magic details.</p>  <p>Thank you in advance.</p>
