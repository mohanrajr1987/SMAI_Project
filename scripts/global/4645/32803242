<p>I use OpenLDAP and I see in outlook address book option "Enable browsing". Does it mean user can see all contacts without do search? In thunderbird I see message "This address book shows contacts only after a search", I hope it can be changed :-) That option "Enable browsing" is in MS office outlook 2007 "tools"->"account setting"->"address books"->"some LDAP address book"->"more settings"->"search".</p>  <p>If "Browsing" is not what I find... Does OpenLDAP support anything else which provide show contacts from address book without need search?</p>  <p>Um, my english is not well, so what I want: See contacts in mail clients supporting LDAP address book without do search.</p>  <p>Thank you for advance!</p>
