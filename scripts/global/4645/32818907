<p>I'm performing a bind to a ldap-server using the class LdapConnection. In case of a "normal" password it works fine. But if the user has a password including ü, ä or ö the server returns an error INVALID CREDENTIALS. I assumed an encoding issue but cannot find any settings .NET-classes. Therefore I had a look at the network traffic I found out that the letter 'ü' is represented in hex by 'fc'. Using a ldap-browser the 'ü' is presented by 'c3bc'.</p>  <pre><code>var identifier = new LdapDirectoryIdentifier("myserver", 389);  var dn = "..."; var passwort = "withÜ"; var credentials = new NetworkCredential(dn, password); var connection = new LdapConnection(identifier, credentials, AuthType.Basic); connection.Bind(credentials); </code></pre>  <p>Any ideas about that?</p>
