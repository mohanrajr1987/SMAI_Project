<p>I want to authenticate my web application users with LDAP. what are the things i need to install. Apart from the terms "Active directory", "LDAP", I dont have any knowledge on how to configure them. what is difference between Active directory(AD), AD LDS, and LDAP. Actually which of these i need to authenticate my users. i need roles , groups etc. i am using windows 2012 server. Any tutorial or video references would be helpful. </p>
