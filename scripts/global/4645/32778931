<p>I'm using ldap search and my search filter is (name=admin) . In my ldap directory there is no such entry with name as 'admin' , but there are entries with cn as 'admin'. So actually the output i expect is null result , but since there is an entry with cn as 'admin' , it is giving an output with that entry as result . Somehow it is checking the value of my name attribute with the value of cn and giving output.</p>  <p>Is there any way to avoid this default check with cn?</p>
