<p>I tried to find a lot (I've already spent one complete day on this) to find the reason for following error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>000004DC: LdapErr: DSID-0C0906E8, comment: In order to perform this   operation a successful bind must be completed on the connection., data   0, v1db1</p> </blockquote>  <p>I've windows AD setup as LDAP server and using this for authentication in sftp using proftpd+ldap in Linux machines.</p>  <p>I've two machines (machine#1 and machine#2), where proftpd+ldap is configured. In both the machines all the required configuration (such as proftpd.conf and ldap.conf) is exactly same.</p>  <p>However, when I try to ftp to machine#1, it is able to do it successfully and shows no error in wireshark (tcpdump). However, when I try to sftp to machine#2, it gives me following error. Below is the tcpdump collected from LDAP server.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/MNZLx.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/MNZLx.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>What I am unable to figure out is, why in failure case (machine#2) only, I am seeing <code>bindRequest "&lt;ROOT&gt;" simple</code> but not in successful case (machine#1).</p>  <p>There is clear indication that there is something in client (machine#2), which is causing this, but not able to figure out what?</p>  <p>Help will be highly appreciated.</p>
