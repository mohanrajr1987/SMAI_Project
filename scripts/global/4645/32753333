<p>I was trying to setup LDAP authentication in my system for the users. The working ldap.conf is shown below. I used  <code>LDAPGenerateHomedir, LDAPForceGeneratedHomedir, LDAPGenerateHomedirPrefix</code> directives to setup the directory path for the logging users.</p>  <p>However, I want to setup the different directory path for different user e.g. For USER-A, I want to setup /home/users/ as prefix. But for all other users, I want to keep it as /general/users/</p>  <p>I've tried possibly all the directives provided by proftpd+ldap. So, firstly, the question is; does it even possible with the set of directives which proftpd+ldap provides?</p>  <p>If yes, how? Please help.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;IfModule mod_ldap.c&gt; LDAPServer "" LDAPBindDN "" "" LDAPUsers none none  LDAPAttr uid uid  LDAPAuthBinds on  #these two are mandatory fields LDAPDefaultUID 499 LDAPDefaultGID 499  LDAPForceDefaultUID on LDAPForceDefaultGID on   LDAPGenerateHomedir on LDAPForceGeneratedHomedir on LDAPGenerateHomedirPrefix /general/users/  RequireValidShell off LDAPProtocolVersion 3 &lt;/IfModule&gt; </code></pre>
