<p>I am setting up Sonatype Nexus OSS, and have some problems on how encoding works on Role names. The LDAP groups have non-latin letters, so role names also have to have these. Everything works until I restart the nexus service - something happens with encoding and role id no longer has those non latin letters and has ?? instead. </p>  <p>What is interesting is that two adjacent fields - role id and role name are encoded differently. For example, if I write "ą" for both role name and role id, then in nexus/conf/security.xml I get</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;security&gt;  ...     &lt;role&gt;       &lt;id&gt;ą&lt;/id&gt;       &lt;name&gt;&amp;amp;#261;&lt;/name&gt;       &lt;description&gt;d&lt;/description&gt;       &lt;roles&gt;         &lt;role&gt;anonymous&lt;/role&gt;       &lt;/roles&gt;     &lt;/role&gt; ... &lt;/security&gt; </code></pre>  <p>After restart this file stays the same, yet in browser and in LDAP mapping id changes  - id becomes ??, name stays "ą". Copying contents of name tag to id tag does not help. Nexus system shows that I have "file.encoding = ANSI_X3.4-1968". I tried making this into UTF8 hoping it would help, but failed so far - I tried "EXPORT -Dfile.encoding=UTF8" or "EXPORT LANG=en_US.UTF-8", but after Nexus restart file.encoding in Nexus is still the same.</p>  <p>Any suggestions?</p>
