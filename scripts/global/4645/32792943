<p>I'm able to connect our CentOS 6.7 server to an external LDAP successfully but the last step in the process requires something in the GUI:</p>  <p>System > Administration > Authentication, then checking "Authentication Method"</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/QQZmk.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/QQZmk.jpg" alt="LDAP Authentication"></a></p>  <p>I'd love to either know the exact file that this change in the GUI modifies or creates, <em>or</em> learn a method that I can use to show me which files have been created or modified in the last five minutes, for example. Of course, I have no idea which directory or directories this file was created or modified in.</p>  <p>I'm primarily a Mac user so we have tools in OS X that can be used for such a purpose, but I'm hoping there's an equivalent method in CentOD/RHEL.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance,</p>  <p>Dan</p>
