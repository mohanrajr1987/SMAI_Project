<p>I have an unmanaged VPS server preinstalled with CentOs 6.6 and WHM/CPanel.  I am trying to install php-ldap but it just says package not found.  I have not been able to find anywhere what repository it should be in.  How can I install ldap on my server to work with php 5.4?  I am trying to manage Windows Server 2012 R2 Active Directory.</p>  <pre><code>root@vps [~]# yum install php-ldap Loaded plugins: fastestmirror, security Setting up Install Process Loading mirror speeds from cached hostfile  * base: mirror.5ninesolutions.com  * epel: fedora-epel.mirror.lstn.net  * extras: centos.arvixe.com  * updates: pubmirrors.dal.corespace.com No package php-ldap available.
