<p>I have a <code>Tomcat 7.47</code> running on <code>java 1.7.0_65</code>. The server I am using is a virtual machine using VMWare, so it cannot be a hardware error and runs <code>CentOS 6.5</code></p>  <p>I created an online chat-tool using the websocket api and my authentification is based on LDAP. The user-information is also received via LDAP using <code>Apache LDAP</code>.</p>  <p>Everything works quite well, but once in a while the whole JVM crashes with a SIGSEGV error.</p>  <pre><code># # A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment: # #  SIGSEGV (0xb) at pc=0x00007f778ad0a040, pid=12392, tid=140151424538368 # # JRE version: OpenJDK Runtime Environment (7.0_65-b17) (build 1.7.0_65-mockbuild_2014_07_16_06_06-b00) # Java VM: OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (24.65-b04 mixed mode linux-amd64 compressed oops) # Problematic frame: # C  [libkrb5.so.3+0x29a040] # # Failed to write core dump.

Next I tried changing the LDAP Library because I thought maybe my previous library <code>UnboundID</code> has some problems with <code>libkrb5.so.3</code> on CentOS but <code>Apache LDAP</code> doesn't work either</p>  <p>I also tried running it with the same java version and the same tomcat version on an Ubuntu laptop and here everything worked fine.</p>  <p>Is there any known bug with <code>libkrb5.so.3</code> on CentOS?</p>
