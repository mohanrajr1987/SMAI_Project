<p>I have a QNAP NAS (TVS-1271U-RP) with the newest Firmware 4.2. Inside this NAS i have set up a Virtual openLDAP Server for testing. The QNAP is able to join into the LDAP remote Server as Client and shows up that its "online" </p>  <p>As i saw in the QNAP Documentation it should be a easy game (just add the Server Address, Credentials and the Paths). For Testing i logged in to the NAS as a LDAP user that i previously created over phpldapadmin successfully. </p>  <p>The Problem is that the QNAP is unable to show me the LDAP users &amp; groups. I need this to set permissions to the directorys.  I cant find any logs from the NAS / LDAP that tells me, that the user information couldn't be replicated.</p>  <p>Any idea what could cause the problem? Did i missed a step in the openLDAP setup where i could set the NAS as slave for user replication or something like that? </p>
