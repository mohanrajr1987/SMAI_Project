<p>Now I need to do a ldap query against the ldap server. Actually now there are 2 server ip addresses for me to use. Now the purpose is to put both the 2 ip addresses in the code. There is a risk one may stop working, so we can use the other one, we can grantee that our application doesn't stop work.</p>  <p>This is the code I am using.</p>  <pre><code>using (var ldapConnection = new LdapConnection(new LdapDirectoryIdentifier(ldapServer, portNumber)))         {             ldapConnection.SessionOptions.VerifyServerCertificate =                 new VerifyServerCertificateCallback((con, cer) =&gt; true);             ldapConnection.SessionOptions.ProtocolVersion = 3;             var networkCredentials = new NetworkCredential(user, pwd, domain);             ldapConnection.SessionOptions.SecureSocketLayer = true;             ldapConnection.AuthType = AuthType.Ntlm;             ldapConnection.Bind(networkCredentials);         } </code></pre>  <p>Can I put the 2 ip addresses in the ldapServer string with a comma? Or do I need to do in other ways?</p>
