<p>I have a Application developed in VC6 and uses the SSPI for the User Logon for the Domain users as per the example found <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/180548" rel="nofollow">here</a>. At times, the application is returning the <code>"AcceptSecurityContext failed 8009030C"</code></p>  <p>I suspected the LDAP controller would have gone off. So I wrote a C#.NET application based on the example found <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Tips/458039/Application-Login-through-Active-Directory-LDAP" rel="nofollow">here</a>. But to my surprise, this .NET application is going through and getting the authentication.</p>  <p>The machine is Win 2008 R2 64 Bit and fully updated.</p>  <p>I am clueless in this. Am I missing anything?</p>  <p>Thanks in Advance.</p>
