<p>I am not sure this question is silly. Sorry if that is the case.</p>  <p>I went through internet and i am able to understand ssh, ldap, PAM concepts/working individually. But i am struggling to understand how they work together and talk to each other.</p>  <p>I need to understand how a user login and password is stored in ldap server and how doing a ssh from a machine talks to ldap server.</p>  <p>If anybody can point me to any tutorial/links, that would be immensely helpful.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
