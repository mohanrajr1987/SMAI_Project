<p>I am using the <a href="http://directory.apache.org/api/" rel="nofollow">Apache LDAP Directory API</a> to handle users in an application. Sometimes there occurs a warning in the logfile which says:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>There is no future associated with operation message ID x, the   operation has been completed.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Information about this message is rare but it seems that every time this message appears some request just return a "not found". Since I can't catch it because it's only a log message is there a way to catch it with reflections or something or is there something like a workaround for this?</p>  <p>I am making many requests and sometimes this message is never shown and sometimes I get this message 10 times out of 2000 requests. No Threads are used.</p>
