<p>For example, there is a <code>ViewModel</code> that has</p>  <ul> <li>a collection of objects requested from a Service</li> <li>an <code>Add</code> command to create and add new objects</li> <li>a <code>Delete</code> command to delete selected objects</li> </ul>  <p>The User creates, adds and deletes objects by using corresponding commands.</p>  <p>How should ViewModel react on User's actions?</p>  <ol> <li>Should <code>ViewModel</code> immediately make a corresponding Service method call when the User invokes a command?</li> </ol>  <p>OR</p>  <ol start="2"> <li>Should <code>ViewModel</code> add / remove items from local collection, mark items as added / deleted and wait to make a Service method call only when the User invokes some <code>Save</code> / <code>Apply changes</code> button?</li> </ol>  <p>The second variant seems more complicated. </p>  <p>Does it give any performance / user experience benefit or enable any features that are not possible with the first variant?</p>  <p>In other words, is it better to keep <code>ViewModel</code> state as close to the Service / Database state as possible?</p>
