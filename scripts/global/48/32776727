<p>There are over 2 million products indexed in SOLR and Elastic-Search. Right now every time the user scrolls down at the bottom of the page- a request is made to the server to fetch another batch of 20 products. Would it be more optimized to fetch ALL the products on the first call from the client side and store them on the client side rather than making a call to the server every time the user scrolls down at the bottom of the page or applies a filter in the facets?</p>
