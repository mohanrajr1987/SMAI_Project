<p>We're undergraduate computer engineering students in an Indian engineering institute. As a part of our major project, our guide has instructed us to build a multi-core ISA using the RISC-V Rocket processor.</p>  <p>We've had an introductory course in Computer Architecture a couple of years back about basic gates, adders, multiplication algorithms, etc. Currently we've started learning Chisel and read up a bit of the ISA Spec on the RISC-V website. We've the whole academic session (runs till April '16) to finish this project.</p>  <p>Please advise on how to proceed further.</p>
