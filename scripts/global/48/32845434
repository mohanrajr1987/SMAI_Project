<p>Databases and Web Services have similar but slightly different roles, but imagining them to be black boxes with an access layer over the the top; what single word could you use to refer to either?</p>  <p>Datasource or repository don't work because they just refer to databases. I need an actual term and not just something made up. Something that is actually googleable and real.</p>  <p>Thanks for your help</p>
