<p>I'm in this situation: I have to build four webapps, A, B, C, D, one of them, let's say A, have to expose an HTTP authentication API to the others. Does this can called a microservice architecture? A, B, C, D are all webapp. Every of them has a database. A contains users and groups. B, C, D have to authenticate on A and save entities related to A. Which options I have to implement this? Oauth? Any suggested resources to read/study? </p>
