<p>I know the difference between domain and application services. But can't really see the difference between methods in domain entities and domain services:/ </p>  <p>I have a game, that has <code>State</code>, <code>Players</code> etc.. It also has methods like <code>AddPlayer</code>, <code>MoveLeft</code>, <code>Jump</code>. Where these methods goes? Should I create naked <code>KOGame</code> with only properties and then <code>KOGameServices</code> with functionality?</p>  <p>Uncle Bob in his article <a href="http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> wrote <em>"An entity can be an object with methods, or it can be a set of data structures and functions."</em></p>  <p>I don't even want to mention that methods like <code>Move</code> or <code>Jump</code> <strong>will have to</strong> be also in App Services, in <code>KOGameAPI</code> - cause those methods are needed by UI (through interfaces of course).</p>  <p>Here is my class:</p>  <pre><code>public class KOGame {     public GameState State { get; set; }     public IList&lt;Player&gt; Players { get; set; }     public int PlayersCount;      public KOGame()     {         State = GameState.New;         PlayersCount = 2;         Players = new List&lt;Player&gt;();     }      public void AddPlayer(Player player)     {     }      public bool MoveRight(int id)     {         return false;     }      public bool MoveLeft(int id)     {         return false;     }      public bool Jump(int id)     {         return false;     } } </code></pre>  <p>So, wrap up my question: What methods goes to Domain Services and what methods goes to Domain Entities? Having for example <code>Class1</code> class, when should I create <code>Class1Services</code> class?  </p>  <p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Just a quick explanation why I choose <code>DDD</code>: I want to create cross platform app and I want to have single layer common for every platform. I choose <code>C#</code>, cause with help of <code>Xamarin</code> I can easily implement single domain model and even services for every platform. I just got stuck at deciding what methods should go to Services and what as a part of entities in <code>Domain Model</code></p>
