<p>In general, the controller is in the presentation layer which get the data from model and sent to <code>view</code>. </p>  <p>Now, my controller get a data, but I need to transfer the format to the javascript style which can be used on the view. For example, I have a list of <code>X</code>, and a list of <code>Y</code>, and I need to create two kind of tables which can be directly used in the view. So I need a method called <code>create_table X Y</code>, For example:</p>  <pre><code>def create_table X Y     @table1 = .....     @table2 = ..... end </code></pre>  <p>and the <code>@table1</code> and <code>@table2</code> is used in the view.</p>  <p>So my problem is, where to put this function? </p>  <p>In controller? I thought most of the method in the controller means the action which related to a specific view. </p>  <p>in the private in controller? I saw that in controller, there are methods such as <code>set_XXX</code> , <code>XXX_params</code> which are private, if I put the method here, the instance in the method can be directly access by the view? </p>  <p>in the helper? I saw some people put the method here and include the helper in controller, but as I know, the method in helper is used only by the view.</p>  <p>Can anyone help me? thanks!</p>
