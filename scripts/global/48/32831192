<p>Microservices are deployed hosting their own database.</p>  <p>What strategies do you employ when business requirements necessitate joins across data in multiple services?</p>  <p>Example problem:  You are implementing a movie review site.  You have a movie microservice that holds the movie DB.  You also have a review microservice that manages reviews in its own separate DB.  Reviews are linked to movies via a GUID; but as these are implemented as separate data stores, not a key constraint.</p>  <p>You would like to have available, accurate to the last minute, a report that tells you the total number of reviews for each review level grouped by the first letter of the movie having a review word count > 25 words.  You currently host 5 million reviews for 40,000 movies.</p>  <p>E.G.   Reviews with more than 25 words:</p>  <ul> <li>A  [8457 "1 star"] [16615 "2 star"] [...</li> <li>B  [98445 "1 star"] [80210 "2 star"] [...</li> <li>...</li> </ul>  <p>Having chosen a microservice architecture for your project, what strategies would you now employ to implement this feature? </p>
