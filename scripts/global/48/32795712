<p>I'm trying to make a design based on the <a href="https://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html" rel="nofollow">Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture</a> in Android. </p>  <p><strong>The problem:</strong></p>  <p>I'd like to solve is how to make the changes generated in one repository to be reflected in other parts of the app, like other repositories or Views.</p>  <p><strong>The example</strong></p>  <p>I've designed a VERY simplified example for this example. Please notice that boundary interfaces has been removed to keep the diagrams small.</p>  <p>Imagine an app that shows a list of videos (with title, thumnail and like count), clicking a video you can see the detail (there you can like/dislike the video).</p>  <p>Additionally the app has an statistics system that counts the number of videos the user liked or disliked.</p>  <p>The main classes for this app could be:</p>  <p><strong>For the Videos part/module:</strong> <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/MPqTe.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/MPqTe.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p><strong>For the Stats part/module:</strong> <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/uuxOc.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/uuxOc.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p><strong>The target</strong></p>  <p>Now imagine you check your stats, then navigate the list of videos, open the detail of one, and click the like button.</p>  <p>The after the like is sent to the server, there are several elements of the apps that should be aware of the change:</p>  <ul> <li>Of course the detail view, should be updated with the changes (this can be made though callbacks so no problem)</li> <li>The list of videos should update the "likes" count for the given video</li> <li>The `StatsRepository may want to update/invalidate the caches after voting a new video</li> <li>If the list of stats is visible (imagine a split screen) it should also show the updated stats (or at least receive the event for re-query the data)</li> </ul>  <p><strong>The Question</strong></p>  <p>What are the common patterns to solve this kind of communication?  Please make your answer as complete as you can, specifying where does the events are generated, how they get propagated though the app, etc.</p>  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Bounties will be given to complete answers</p>
