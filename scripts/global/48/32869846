<p>I'm creating a maven modules of spring + jersey+ mybatis application in a jboss server. Currently i have the following structure</p>  <pre><code>app-parent   | \      |  \_ app-module1   |____ app-module2   |____ app-module3   |____ app-lib </code></pre>  <p>Each of the app-module* has the dependency of app-lib, and each of the app-module* does not refer to any other app-module*. All the DAOs, Services etc., should be contained within itself, except the app-lib(utilities, logging etc.,). </p>  <p>Note: Jboss datasource has a jndi name <code>app.module.ds</code>.</p>  <p>-> Now the question is, what is the best way to configure the spring <code>datasource</code> <strong>bean</strong> for this type of application? </p>  <ol> <li>Can 'datasource' bean be created per app-module*?</li> <li>Or should I create a 'datasource' bean in the common library 'app-lib' and share it among the applications?</li> </ol>  <p>Which one is better? and why?</p>
