<p>I'm building an SDK to be used in a hosting app. This SDK is going to be integrated in applications with a lot of users.</p>  <p>We started to build it with a layered architecture - UI, managers interacting with models and networking layer. Three layers total. The UI is getting updates by callbacks.</p>  <hr>  <p>Side note: I was a member in teams that builded some Android applications with a lot of users, in all of them we used the same layered architecture. These applications have active users and there is a good feedbacks until now.</p>  <hr>  <p>We have our beta version and it seems that everything is working as expected.</p>  <p>A week ago one of our team members come and say that he think we need to change our architecture to event driven based. We will have static event handles in the SDK that handle all the listeners and the dispatch will be triggered from some other component. </p>  <p>I think it's a bit risky, I think it will be hard to handle a large SDK with a lot of dependencies and services, in a multithreaded environment in that way. In addition, because we are building an SDK, we want to isolate our main classes form our host application, and I think it will be almost impossible.</p>  <p><strong>My questions</strong>: </p>  <ol> <li><p>What do you think is the right way to go, is the layered architecture good and we need to stick with it, or the event based is the preferred one?</p></li> <li><p>Do you think it's a suitable solution for an SDK that's needs to be as efficient as possible?</p></li> <li><p>Do you think that this is a good solution for a multithreaded environment? </p></li> </ol>  <p>Appreciate any feedback, thanks.</p>  <p>some articles I have read:</p>  <p><a href="http://fernandocejas.com/2014/09/03/architecting-android-the-clean-way/" rel="nofollow">architecting-android-the-clean-way</a></p>  <p><a href="https://blog.inf.ed.ac.uk/sapm/2014/02/13/architectural-patterns-for-mobile-application-development/" rel="nofollow">architectural-patterns-for-mobile-application-development</a></p>  <p><a href="https://medium.com/google-developer-experts/event-driven-programming-for-android-part-i-f5ea4a3c4eab" rel="nofollow">event-driven-programming-for-android</a></p>
