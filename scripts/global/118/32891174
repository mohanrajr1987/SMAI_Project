<p>I'm trying to embed a certain text file as a resource in my EXE, and I'm having a heck of a time of it.</p>  <p>I made a simple one-line <code>.rc</code> file and added it to the project, but BRCC32 chokes on it with a completely unhelpful error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>[BRCC32 Error] MyRes.rc(1): Fatal error Illegal macro definition in command line or defines page.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Here's the contents of the file, in its entirety:</p>  <pre><code>DATA_BASIC_ORDER     RCDATA Data\Data_BasicOrder.txt </code></pre>  <p>This only happens if I build in the IDE.  I'm able to successfully build a .RES file from this on the command line, and opening it in a hex editor shows both the resource name and the contents of the text file, but if I link it in with a <code>{$R}</code> directive, the resource doesn't show up in the EXE. I verified it with ResHacker; the resource just isn't there.  So something very strange is going on.</p>  <p>I have tried shutting down and restarting the IDE.  No change.  I also opened the <code>.rc</code> file in a hex editor to make sure that there are no weird characters messing things up, but no, it's a plain ANSI text file.</p>  <p>Does anyone have any idea what's going on with this and how I can fix it?</p>  <p><strong>EDIT:</strong> It keeps getting weirder.  If I leave the file line completely blank, I still get the same error.  But if I remove the file from the project, (removing it from the listing in the Project Explorer,) that error message goes away, but it's still not showing up in the build.</p>
