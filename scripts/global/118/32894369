<p>My company just switched from using Delphi 2007 to Delphi XE4, and now we want to move from Crystal Reports to FastReport. However, we have over 200 reports that need to be converted. I know there was an "official" converter available on the FastReport website but it doesn't seem to be available for Delphi. Is there any other converting tool available to do that? Or is there a way to get my hands on the original mythical converter for Crystal to Fast Reports?</p>
