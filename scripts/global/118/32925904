<p>I have previously done iOS development from my work PC, and connected to PAServer on the mac through a hardwired network connection. Now, I have Parallels installed on the Mac and would like to work from anywhere, all contained within this MacBook Pro.</p>  <p>PAServer however works via IP Address. The Mac is subject to switch across different WiFi networks, as well as between WiFi and a hardwire - or possibly without any network at all. I would hate to have to keep reconfiguring my connection to PAServer every time my IP Address changes.</p>  <p>How should I set up my development environment in Parallels so that it persists a permanent connection to a never-changing IP on PAServer?</p>
