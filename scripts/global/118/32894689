<p>I edited some Delphi 6 code from</p>  <pre><code>if functionA then  else procedureB </code></pre>  <p>into</p>  <pre><code>if functionA then   if testC then procedureD else procedureB </code></pre>  <p>instead of the correct</p>  <pre><code>if functionA then   begin   if testC then procedureD   end else procedureB </code></pre>  <p>If the compiler had warned me the connected if-else wasn't equally indented I would have realized my error at compile time.  Note that the correct code takes the "else" branch and calls procedureB only if functionA isn't true.  The wrong code takes the "else" only if functionA is true and testC is false.</p>  <p>Even if the original was</p>  <pre><code>if not functionA then procedureB </code></pre>  <p>I might have edited it into the wrong version.</p>  <p>Does any version of Delphi warn about unbalanced if-else indentation?</p>
