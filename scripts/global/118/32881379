<p>When I load XML data using <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms763742%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">MSXML</a> DOM parser and there are errors <code>IXMLDOMDocument.parseError</code> contains an error code and error message. The error message is localized (i.e. German on a German Windows installation).</p>  <p>Is it possible to get a non-localized English message regardless of the OS installation language? Maybe by converting the error code into string manually using some COM API function or by setting some application-wide language mode to English/US?</p>
