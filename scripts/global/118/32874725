<p>Hy! What is the best way to find the first two Word in a string? For example, my string is an adress like : Cross Keys st 13. I need only 'Cross Keys' from it. Should I count the words in the string or there a better solution for that? </p>  <p>I can get the first and the last Word easily. I am new in Delphi. Thanks for the suggestions. </p>  <pre><code>procedure SampleForm.ButtonClick(Sender: TObject); var   st: string;   myString : string;   C: integer; begin   st := Cross Keys st 13;   C:=LastDelimiter(' ',st);    myString := Copy(st,1,pos(' ',st)-1);   mystring:=Copy(st,C+1,length(st)-C); </code></pre>
