<p>The following is a known bug in Delphi 7 and 2007 (and possibly other versions)</p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15252559/does-tmonitor-getboundsrect-have-an-access-violation-bug-in-delphi-2007-triggere">Does TMonitor.GetBoundsRect have an access violation bug in Delphi 2007 triggered by VNC?</a></p>  <p>There is an answer on how to fix it by recompiling forms.pas but I'd rather not recompile RTL units. Has anybody created a runtime patch for it e.g. using the technique also used in Andy Hausladen's VclFixpack? (And if yes, would you please share it with us?)</p>
