<p>I'm attempting to translate some C++ DX11 Direct3d height-map code into Delphi. I'm at at a stage where I have almost the entire code translated across without any compile errors or run-time errors however I cannot for the life of me get anything to render on-screen - which I believe may be a vertex/pixel shader issue.</p>  <p>The code I'm translating across is here:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.rastertek.com/tertut02.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rastertek.com/tertut02.html</a></p>  <p>And I'm using the JSB DirectX11 interface libraries from here:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.jsbmedical.co.uk/DirectXForDelphi/" rel="nofollow">http://www.jsbmedical.co.uk/DirectXForDelphi/</a></p>  <p>I know that the Direct3D subsystem is working correctly as I am able to alter the color of the background of the render surface however, I just do not get any polygons rendered on the display.</p>  <p>There is quite a lot of code which I'm unable to upload here so for convenience, here's a copy of my source (without any object files/binaries)</p>  <p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/r90jbl6vz9gb3s7/Delphi%20Height%20Map.zip?dl=0" rel="nofollow">https://www.dropbox.com/s/r90jbl6vz9gb3s7/Delphi%20Height%20Map.zip?dl=0</a></p>  <p>Unfortunately, there doesn't appear to be many Delphi DX11 or D3D examples on the internet so I have nothing to benchmark the code against.</p>  <p>I'd be eternally grateful if anyone could offer any pointers as to what may be the issue. Like I say, the code compiles and runs without any errors but just nothing is rendered.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance, Kevin</p>
