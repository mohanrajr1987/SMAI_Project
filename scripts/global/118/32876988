<p>I am trying to construct a Delphi Windows program that provides an automated interface into SurveyMonkey (using data from our database).  I expect to use INDY for some of the interface, but I'm not sure what to do with the "redirect URL" requirement in Mashery.  I don't have to go through the OAuth sequence since I will only be accessing our single account.</p>  <p>The windows program will run continuously in a virtual machine on one of our servers.  When it receives a signal, it will assemble information and send it to SurveyMonkey (in order to send emails).  It will then get the responses from last weeks survey and record them in the database.</p>  <p>Any general guidelines on how to approach this project?</p>
