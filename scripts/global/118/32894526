<p>After adding a call to an https website in our DataSnap TCP server, it started crashing on finalization.</p>  <p>The crash is on <code>Data.DBXOpenSSL.pas</code> more specifically on this method:</p>  <pre><code>class procedure TRSACypher.ClearKey(var AKey: PRSAPeer); begin   if AKey &lt;&gt; nil then     IPPeerProcs._RSA_free(AKey); // Crash here   AKey := nil; end; </code></pre>  <p>The exception is:</p>  <p><code>First chance exception at $00000000. Exception class $C0000005 with message 'access violation at 0x00000000: read of address 0x00000000'. Process Project1.exe (3996)</code></p>  <p>I wrote a project which reproduces the problem and it crashes on both XE7 and Delphi 10 Seattle, the project is hosted here:</p>  <p><a href="https://gist.github.com/fabioxgn/aaaddb5aa65db5d17202" rel="nofollow">https://gist.github.com/fabioxgn/aaaddb5aa65db5d17202</a></p>  <p>What the project does is simple:</p>  <ul> <li>Make a GET call using OpenSSL to <a href="https://google.com" rel="nofollow">https://google.com</a></li> <li>Starts the DataSnap server</li> <li>Opens and then closes a single connection to this DataSnap server</li> </ul>  <p>A few points:</p>  <ul> <li>If don't make the https call, everything works fine</li> <li>This only happens with the RSA filter enabled, if I remove the filter it doesn't crash</li> </ul>  <p>Any clues about what is making this crash? I tried debbuging but this code uses a lot of IPPeerFactory and I couldn't find the final code which is run.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
