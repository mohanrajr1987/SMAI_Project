<p>Using Delphi XE3, I created a lookup field obtaining a float value from another client dataset. When presenting the value of this lookup field, if the value has not decimal digits, the value is not presented, otherwise, if the value has decimal digits, the value is presented. I have already checked everything that can interfere such as masks, attributes. There is no reason for that. Is that a problem of Delphi? I ask this question because I use the same resource in Delphi XE and no problem occurs.</p>
