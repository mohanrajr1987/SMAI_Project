<p>I am seeing <code>NetworkError: 404 Not Found - http://tmscdn.coremetrics.com/tms/cp-v?</code> error in the browser when I am accessing my project webpage. Why is this error popping up? I know it is related to coremetrics. but, not sure why and where this is getting triggered from. Can anyone please help me understand this? Thanks in advance</p>
