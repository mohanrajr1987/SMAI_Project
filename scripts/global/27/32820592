<p>I'm looking for libraries to connect to a website, execute its javascript and get the template generated after javascript is executed. I mean, simulate a browser and then parse html(html base + html generated by javascript = html that I want to parse).</p>  <p>I would like to know if there is any library in PHP and java.</p>
