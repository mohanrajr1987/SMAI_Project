<p>Is it possible to pack s single page application (its JavaScript files and images and all the assets) so that it can be distributed as a native  <strong>desktop</strong> application? Like having an instance of Chrome without any button that just runs your application offline. I've used software that seems to be crafted like that, for example TweetDeck by Twitter gives me the impression of being just the web-version of TweetDeck packed in some way to run in a context that is not your standard browser.</p>
