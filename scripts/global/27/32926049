<p>I have a habit of saving many webpages so that I dont have to waste my internet looking and finding things again.Today I tried opening one of the saved pages.It consists of a html file and a resource folder.But on opeing file with a browser only text part is loaded no scripts , images and all. If I try deleting the html or the folder both get deleted simultaneously so the file and folder are associated as they should? What could be the problem</p>
