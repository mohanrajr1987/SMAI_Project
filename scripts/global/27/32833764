<p>The PapaParse CSV parser has a function to stream-parse over plain http:</p>  <pre><code>Papa.parse("http://example.com/big.csv", {     download: true,     step: function(row) {         console.log("Row:", row.data);     },     complete: function() {         console.log("All done!");     } }); </code></pre>  <p>I tried in the past to implement a stream parser in the browser via the <code>onprogress</code> event, but I found that browsers do not give access to <code>xhr.responseText</code> until the request has completed. How does PapaParse do this? </p>  <p>I would be really interested in a library or jQuery plugin that does this for plain text.</p>
