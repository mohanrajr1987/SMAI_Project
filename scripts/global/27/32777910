<p>Currently I'm trying to do the layout for my shopping website. I've come across weird problem I do not understand whether it's my fault or a browser (but I'm more likely to think that I've done something wrong.). My page is not loading fully, it looks like browser loads a part of it and then stops. However if I put some even random words or letters below the code, for each letter I put a one character of expected content shows up. And there is nothing apart from some php (that should now affect html view I guess), and bootstrap used apart from html.</p>  <p>And since the html I wrote is rather long I'll post those parts in a github gists to make this post more readable. </p>  <p>Here's the code: <a href="https://gist.github.com/kbialy92/73301401014624de3f73" rel="nofollow">https://gist.github.com/kbialy92/73301401014624de3f73</a></p>  <p>So is it a problem that is somehow connected to the browser, memory usage or just the code written incorrectly?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
