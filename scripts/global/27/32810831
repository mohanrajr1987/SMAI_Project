<p>I have a java program of a card game. The players can connect to the program through a browser that open an java applet. The problem is that more and more browsers doesn't support that way of connection. It is for example not possible with the latest version of Google Chrome. When you open it with IE there is a popup indicating that in the future it will not be possible anymore. The only browser that works well for the moment is firefox. </p>  <p>I am not a programmer, so I don't know wich possibilities I have. I want to make a standalone startup of my program, so the players doens't have to connect through a browser, but just have to download that standalone startup. How do I do that. How can I convert my JApplet to a downloadable jar that the players can use to connect to the game? </p>
