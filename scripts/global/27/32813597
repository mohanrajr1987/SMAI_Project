<p>I need to warn app users that accidentally close that they have unsaved work. My research shows different browsers act differently; alas through this link: <a href="http://www.openjs.com/scripts/events/exit_confirmation.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.openjs.com/scripts/events/exit_confirmation.php</a> I got code that works in: IE11, Chrome45, firefox40, opera31.. and fails on safari 5.1.7 (under windows 8).</p>  <p>The test code html and js :</p>  <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE HMTL&gt; &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt;Unsaved Work Warning&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt;   &lt;body &gt;         &lt;h1&gt;Try to close page and get confirm warning &lt;script language="javascript"&gt; function goodbye(e) {     if(!e) e = window.event;     //e.cancelBubble is supported by IE - this will kill the bubbling    process.     e.cancelBubble = true;     e.returnValue = 'You sure you want to leave?'; //This is displayed on the dialog      //e.stopPropagation works in Firefox.     if (e.stopPropagation) {         e.stopPropagation();         e.preventDefault();     } } window.onbeforeunload=goodbye;  &lt;/script&gt;     &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Looks like I need to stick in code to detect nav-out (including tab and browser closure) and issue "unsaved work" warning for safari.</p>  <p>Safari experts please advise.</p>
