<p>As a web developer, you can only go to a certain amount of effort to optimize your CSS code. However, computers can take into account way more in almost no time and are thus better in optimizing. <strong>The question is: What CSS code is hypothetically the most optimized?</strong> <em>(for modern browsers)</em></p>  <p>Considering the following image: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/lZgLL.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/lZgLL.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p><strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong>, <strong>C</strong> and <strong>D</strong> are DOM-objects (lets say DIV-elements) and the numbers 1-17 represent attributes (like color, background, width, height, etc) </p>  <p><em>Whereas all numbers represent a unique attributes. e.g:</em></p>  <pre><code>4 = background-color: #FF0;     5 = width: 50px; 10 = background-color: #F00; </code></pre>  <p>There are multiple ways you can generate the css code for this web:</p>  <p><strong>All own ID's</strong></p>  <pre><code>#A { 1 2 5 8 9 10 12 } #B { 1 4 5 11 12 13 14 15 } #C { 1 2 3 5 7 } #D { 3 4 5 6 16 17 } </code></pre>  <p>However, the file would be very large, the attributes are not shared and a simple test proofs that this is rather slow to render. <em>(image1.html, see file generating script below)</em></p>  <p><strong>Share some common attributes</strong></p>  <pre><code>#A { 2 8 9 10 12 } #B { 4 11 12 13 14 15 } #C { 2 3 7 } #D { 3 4 6 16 17 } .1 { 1 } .5 { 5 } </code></pre>  <p>The file would be smaller and the rendering seems to be quicker. <em>(see image2.html)</em></p>  <p><strong>Share ALL common attributes</strong></p>  <pre><code>#A { 8 9 10 } #B { 11 13 14 15 } #C { 7 } #D { 6 16 17 } .1 { 1 } .3 { 3 } .2 { 2 } .4 { 4 } .5 { 5 } .12 { 12 } </code></pre>  <p>The file would be even smaller (most of the time) and as it turns out the rendering goes quicker as well. But notice that <strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong> and <strong>C</strong> end up with one ID, and 4 classes that contain only one attribute! <em>(see image3.html)</em></p>  <p>Now these are three simple examples of CSS code. But as you can imagion, when more DOM objects exist, and more overlap of attributes exist, you could theoretically end up with one DOM object with 1 ID and 10'ths of classes!</p>  <p><strong>What CSS code is hypothetically the most optimized?</strong> <em>(for modern browsers)</em>  Should you limit the amount of classess per DOM object? should you prefer a "single attribute containing class" over adding it to an ID?</p>  <p><em>p.s. <strong>as a test I loaded an image using PHP</strong>. Than read the pixel value of that PNG and create the same picture using CSS and DIV-elements. <a href="http://pastebin.com/DQxiFz5z" rel="nofollow">The code for generating <strong>image1.html</strong>, <strong>image2.html</strong> and <strong>image3.html</strong> can be found here</a></em> <em>You can use ANY PNG image...
