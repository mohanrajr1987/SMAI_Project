<p>If I have 2 divs on the page:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div/&gt; &lt;div/&gt; </code></pre>  <p>And then I get a reference to the second element:</p>  <pre><code>var node = document.getElementsByTagName("div")[1]; </code></pre>  <p>How does the browser know which node it is? There is no <code>id</code> property, just bare nodes. There should be some internal identifier, I guess, but I don't know if it's exposed in the JavaScript API.</p>  <p>UPDATE: Ok, the question seems a bit vague. </p>  <p>What if I have 2 references to these 2 divs: d1 and d2. </p>  <p>How does "d1 === d2" work?</p>  <p>Comparison requires identification. If you have 2 instances of a class, you can tell if they're the same by comparing their identifiers (references). What is the inner identification method the browser uses to compare two DOM nodes?</p>
