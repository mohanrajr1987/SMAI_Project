<p>Does any web browser support native deflate/inflate or are there any plans for such support? I mean a way to access those functions through javascript.</p>  <p>The DEFLATE Compressed Data Format Specification version 1.3 is specified at <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1951.txt" rel="nofollow">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1951.txt</a> and PNG and WOFF use it as a compression scheme, which means that new browsers have support for both INFLATE and DEFLATE. Also browsers can decompress on the fly files that are compressed on a server.</p>  <p>I have searched about this a lot, but it seems that NONE OF THE BROWSERS LET USER TO ACCESS DEFLATE/INFLATE FUNCTIONALITY AND USING EXTERNAL JAVASCRIPT LIBRARIES IS THE ONLY OPTION, eg.<br> - <a href="https://github.com/nodeca/pako" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/nodeca/pako</a><br> - <a href="https://github.com/imaya/zlib.js" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/imaya/zlib.js</a>  </p>  <p>For me it seems a bit odd to use external libraries when there is a native and probably significantly faster way builtin, but access to it is forbidden by browser.</p>  <p>Nowadays there are a lot of browser apis that allow binary data handling (typed arrays, file reader, blob, streams etc), but the control of compressing and decompressing this data is not made too easy.</p>
