<p>I need to extract text and save to a database 100s maybe 1000s of local files such as docs, pdfs etc.. I think Textract <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/textract" rel="nofollow">https://www.npmjs.com/package/textract</a> would do the job nicely but I assume this will need each file to be uploaded first.</p>  <p>Does the file need to be uploaded to the server completely each time? </p>  <p>or is there a way of avoiding uploading every file and processing the files with the local computer instead before pushing the text to a database. This would be faster and reduce server costs immensely.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
