<p>I created a page and uploaded it for hosting in 000webhost. Here is the link: <a href="http://creatorscreations.vacau.com/" rel="nofollow">http://creatorscreations.vacau.com/</a>.</p>  <p>While opening it in Mozilla Firefox it works fine but while opening it in Chrome some elements not working properly as listed below.</p>  <p>1st issue: Header part. dimensions changed for diffirent browsers.</p>  <p>2nd issue : I used (a name="#") to scroll page to a certain place using anchor tags which are placed at navigation bar(header) like portofolio, about,etc,.. but when clicking on any of those links each browsers showing different locations like chrome exceeding the portions.....</p>  <p>When clicking on portofolio mozilla showing perfect location but Google Chrome is appearing over portofolio.</p>
