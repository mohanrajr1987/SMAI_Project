<p>I built a website for a client that is running Instagram ads and when a user clicks on the ad, parts of the website does not load within Instagram's (native) browser. </p>  <p>This site was properly audited and tested on mobile devices and multiple mobile browsers and I can't seem to find any information on how to test for Instagram's native browser.</p>  <p>The other problem with troubleshooting this is you can't share an Instagram ad and check what it's clicking through to. There is also no way for me to test paging in the Instagram browser since the URL field is not visible.</p>  <p>Any help or direction would be greatly appreciated.</p>
