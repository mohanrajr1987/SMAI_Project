<p>I need to detect that a user is trying to go forward a page.</p>  <p>This can happen in multiple ways:</p>  <ul> <li>Clicking the forward button</li> <li>Hitting a mouse button that is bound 'forward'</li> <li>Using a mouse gesture</li> </ul>  <p>I think all of these actions are bound to the same event anyway...</p>  <p>What's important for me is that the action should be detectable even if there are no more pages to go forward to, i.e. if the 'forward' button is disabled and a user hits mouse 4 to forward, I can still note that something was triggered.</p>
