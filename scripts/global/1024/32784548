<p>I have an angular app that allows the users to open details about a product on a modal window. The modal has corresponding url with it (/product/:id). A requirement of the app is that the users should be able to open multiple modals of this state on top of each other - for the different products they are viewing. Ex: /product/1, /product/2... Here is the code for the routing:</p>  <pre><code>$stateProvider.state('product', { url: '/product/:id', onEnter: ["$modal", function ($modal) {    $modal.open({       templateUrl: '/App/product/product.html',       controller: 'ProductController',       controllerAs: 'vm'    }); }]              </code></pre>  <p>});</p>  <p>The problem  is that when I open new modal for a product, all the other previously opened modals of this state re-run their ProductController with the data from the latest product. How can I run different instances of one controller in parallel, each containing the data for the product that is was opened for?</p>
