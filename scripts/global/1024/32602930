<p>I have a variable declared in AppDelegate class(.h file) whose value gets changed from multiple ViewController classes.Also,single application-wide instance for my AppDelegate class is shared throughout my application as follows :</p>  <p><strong>AppDelegate *AppD = (AppDelegate *)[[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate];</strong></p>  <p>As I could access this variable declared in AppDelegate from any ViewController class, is AppDelegate class as an example of Singleton class in this scenario? </p>  <p>Can anyone help to site out the usage of singleton class with real-life example ?</p>
