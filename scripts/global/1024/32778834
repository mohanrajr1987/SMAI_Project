<p>There is some scenario where i'm getting confused because i'm trying that approach for the first time.</p>  <p>I have a Controller class and one singleton class. There is a method in singleton class which i'm calling from controller class and in that i'm passing its instance as argument for later reference.</p>  <p>Check the image below:</p>  <p>This is RegistrationViewController, in which i'm calling function of singleton and passing weak reference</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/CaerN.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/CaerN.png" alt=""></a></p>  <p>2nd picture if of singleton class, in which i'm creating an instance of ASIHTTPRequest and setting its userinfo with controller reference</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/mc5Zh.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/mc5Zh.png" alt=""></a></p>  <p>Now, is this the correct approach and will save me from leaks and retain cycles? I passed weak reference so that in case if my controller class deallocates, asihttprequest should not hold it. After the successful result i get back the controller reference from the AsiHttpRequest instance and call the controller function for some data handling. <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/JKdNN.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/JKdNN.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I might be not clear with the explanation here, but hopes you understand and clarify my mind and concept about his. Thanks in advance</p>
