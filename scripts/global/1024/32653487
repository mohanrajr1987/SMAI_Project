<p>I have a Singleton class that I want to test. It uses a @Inject annotation for that class's contructor. Now for testing I want to call a public method for that class in my test class but unable to do so. I have mocked an object that is getting passed to the constructor.</p>  <pre><code>@Inject     private SomeClass(SomeOtherClassObject obj) {         super(obj);     } </code></pre>  <p>I mocked the above private constructor in the following way:</p>  <pre><code>Singleton mockSingleton = PowerMock.createMock(Singleton.class);         PowerMock.expectNew(Singleton.class).andReturn(mockSingleton); </code></pre>  <p>I dont understand how do I call the following method</p>  <pre><code>public SomeClass someMethod(int 1, String 2){  //some logic  return (Object of SomeClass) } </code></pre>  <p>Any help will be appreciated. Thank You.</p>
