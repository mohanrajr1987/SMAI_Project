<p>I have seen a singletone code that uses a function without parentheses. i wanted to know is there any difference between a <strong>function without parentheses</strong> and a <strong>function with parentheses that takes no arguments</strong>. Here in the code <code>public static MySingleton Instance</code> has no parentheses:<br> (The code is for <strong>unity</strong> by the way and written in <strong>c#</strong>)</p>  <pre><code>public class MySingleton {     private static MySingleton instance;      public MySingleton ()     {         if (instance != null)         {             Debug.LogError ("Cannot have two instances of singleton.");             return;         }         instance = this;     }      public static MySingleton Instance     {         get         {             if (instance == null)             {                 new MySingleton ();             }         return instance;         }     } } </code></pre>
