<p>I've been working for a month on my code using SVN and until today everything was ok, but know all changes that i've done to the code are not recognised by SVN, i mean when i go to commit my changes in synchronize view they don't appear.  Moreover before today any change made on code produced the black icon on the .java or .xhtml file and now it doesn't. Does anybody have any idea about what can be ?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
