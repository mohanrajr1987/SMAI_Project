<p>Scenario:<br> I have multiple release branches all being modified concurrently. We then merge all changes from the lowest release branch to the highest release branch in order.  </p>  <p>As each major (<strong>1</strong>.0) and minor (1.<strong>1</strong>) release are deployed to production, we merge the release to trunc.</p>  <p>I would like to be able to set the merge to happen w/out me having to click the <code>Prefer repository</code> button for each inevitable conflict.</p>  <p>Is there a setting to do this?<br> Or maybe a way to do this w/ just SVN?</p>  <p><strong>UPDATED:</strong><br> When I try to do the merge using <code>--accept theirs-full</code> I get an error.<br> It looks like It isn't handling tree conflicts.</p>  <p>Command:<br/> <code>svn merge -r 20157:24006 https://.../branches/releases/Release_5_0 --accept theirs-full</code></p>  <p>Error:</p>  <pre><code>... Resolved conflicted state of '...\FileX' Resolved conflicted state of '...\FileY.java' Summary of conflicts:   Text conflicts: 36 remaining (and 7 already resolved)   Tree conflicts: 21 remaining (and 1 already resolved) svn: E155027: Tree conflict can only be resolved to 'working' state; 'C:\Users\...\File.java' not resolved </code></pre>  <p>How can I make it do theirs in all cases except use working for tree conflicts, </p>
