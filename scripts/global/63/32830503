<p>Hello Dear SonarQube Enthusiasts,</p>  <p>I was wondering if it was possible to specify a network location for the element in a <code>sonar-runner</code> properties file, <code>sonar.projectBaseDir</code>. I was trying to do this: <code>sonar.projectBaseDir = https://subversion-server/svn/Project/trunk</code> This however gave an <code>EXECUTION FAILURE</code> because <code>sonar-runner</code> simply appended the network location specified to the current directory and looked there instead of across the Intranet. </p>  <p>Does anyone know how to specify a network location as a scan directory; so I am constantly scanning the updated code from a network location? </p>  <p>Thank-you for reading this. </p>  <p>Regards,</p>
