<p>I was using my RapidSVN for last year just fine, and today at some point it just stopped working. I mean I used to commit a change to a file, and then commit on a different file and all the sudden this started. All this SVN was not set up by me, so I don't know how to manage it. Where should I start?</p>  <p>Here is the error:</p>  <pre><code>Execute: Commit Error: Error while performing action: Commit failed (details follow): Unable to connect to a repository at URL 'svn://server.domainname.com/domainname.com' Ready </code></pre>
