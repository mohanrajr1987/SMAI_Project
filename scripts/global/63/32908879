<p>My Images.xcassets list was getting long, so I decided to organize it with sub folders. Since then, I am not able to commit any changes for the <code>Images.xcassets</code> to my SVN repository. I keep getting the error:</p>  <pre><code>Commit failed (details follow): 'filePath/gopremium.imageset/gopremium' is not under version control (1) </code></pre>  <p>Within XCode, the <code>Images.xcassets</code> does have the M to the right indicating it has been modified, but I cant seem to see which specifics files are under version control. I thought they were added automatically, but it appears I'm wrong. Does anyone know how I can add everything in the <code>Images.xcassets</code> under version control?</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>  <p>I ran the <code>svn st</code> command. The output is very long so I am posting a couple examples. Here is one from a directory I created and images which were not previous under source control</p>  <pre><code>A       MyApp/Images.xcassets/myDirectory/F00.imageset A       MyApp/Images.xcassets/myDirectory/F00.imageset/Contents.json A       MyApp/Images.xcassets/myDirectory/F00.imageset/F00.png ?
