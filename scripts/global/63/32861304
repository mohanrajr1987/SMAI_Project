<p>I have installed the Bugzilla-VCS and and I have configured SVN repository in it.</p>  <pre><code>vcs_repos = Svn file:///path/to/svn/repository  vcs_web = file:///path/to/svn/repository/ https://server.name.com/svn-web/wsvn/repository%project%?rev=%revno% </code></pre>  <p>And I am getting the commit information on bug page on Bugzilla for the mentioned in SVN commit.</p>  <p>But it has small issue, It doesn't show the web URL in comment details. However it shows the physical path as below,</p>  <pre><code>- 13 by user@company.com at 2015-09-30 09:13:00 CEST Checked in to file:///path/to/svn/repository/trunk updates bug 2 1 file changed: test file.txt (+3 / -0) </code></pre>  <p>What changed should be done to appear it as web URL?</p>  <p>I tired changing the vcs_repos and vcs_web values to web URL but it does not helped.</p>
