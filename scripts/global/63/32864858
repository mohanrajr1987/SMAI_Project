<p>I use Eclipse 4.3 and Subversion(svn) I have renamed a file existing in Subversion. But when I am trying to check in the renamed file it gives me error as follows:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>org.tigris.subversion.svnclientadapter.SVNClientException: org.apache.subversion.javahl.ClientException: Bad URL passed to RA layer   svn: URL 'svn.abcd.com/repos/modules/management/trunk/au-benefitsmanagement-service/src/main/java/com/abcd/management/service/RenamedFile.java' non-existent in revision 837972.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I have renamed the file by Right Click -> Rename</p>  <p>Please let me know how can i check in the file. Am i missing some step in renaming a file?</p>  <p>Thanks, Shreyansh</p>
