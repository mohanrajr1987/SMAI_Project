<p>The operating system is Windows 7. I am working with Eclipse Luna and using Subclipse plugin. </p>  <p>There is a SVN Repository setup on a remote computer. </p>  <p>The URL is <code>svn://dev-server/svn_repo/Sch</code>.</p>  <p>I am in "SVN Repository Exploring" Perspective. And I have included the above SVN Repository in the SVN Repositories view. I am connected to it. </p>  <p>Inside it has 3 folders: <code>branches</code>, <code>head</code> and <code>version</code>.</p>  <p>Inside <code>branches</code> folder I want to create a new empty branch named <strong><code>B1965</code></strong>. </p>  <p>Inside that new branch <strong><code>B1965</code></strong> I want to create 4 folders: <code>AppEar</code>, <code>AppEjb</code>, <code>AppEjbClient</code> and <code>AppWeb</code>. Then I would like to Checkout those 4 folders from new branch <strong><code>B1965</code></strong>.</p>  <p>How can I do these things through Eclipse? </p>
