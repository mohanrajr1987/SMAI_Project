<p>I have this:</p>  <pre><code>setLocal EnableDelayedExpansion set sFolder=C:\Path\ cd %sFolder%\ ::#) Creates a .txt file of the SVN logs svn log | sed -n '/USER/,/-----$/ p'  &gt;&gt; c:\temp\Test.txt </code></pre>  <p>This provides part of the information that I want. For example, it returns:</p>  <pre><code>r844454 | USER | 2015-09-24 12:07:25 -0400 (Thu, 24 Sep 2015) | 2 lines The specific log message for this commit. </code></pre>  <p>However, after this information, I want to include the changes that were implemented. For example, if the commit changed a line of text from "cat" to "dog", then I want the NEW/MODIFIED line to be included so that I end up with something like this.</p>  <pre><code>r844454 | USER | 2015-09-24 12:07:25 -0400 (Thu, 24 Sep 2015) | 2 lines The specific log message for this commit. Cat on a hot tin roof. r844250 | USER | 2015-09-24 10:07:25 -0400 (Thu, 24 Sep 2015) | 2 lines The specific log message for this commit. Cat on a hot tin root. r844103 | USER | 2015-09-24 08:07:25 -0400 (Thu, 24 Sep 2015) | 2 lines The specific log message for this commit. Cat on a hot pin root. </code></pre>
