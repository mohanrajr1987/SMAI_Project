<p>I cloned a svn repository using this:    </p>  <pre><code>git svn init -T trunk --prefix=origin/ https://foo.bar.com/svn/project0 ./project0 cd project0 git svn fetch </code></pre>  <p>Then I decided that I wanted to create a new branch, so I added an entry to my project0/.git/config file:</p>  <pre><code>branches = branches/*:refs/remotes/origin/* </code></pre>  <p>And I tried to test out creating the branch with a dry-run:</p>  <pre><code>git svn branch --dry-run -m "Adding new feature" feature_branch </code></pre>  <p>git svn then starts fetching from <code>https://foo.bar.com/svn/project0/branches/release-candidate/</code>, which takes forever.  I don't want it to do that.  I just want to create a new branch without going and fetching every other branch.  What can I do?</p>
