<p>So I have a master and one branch made from it. I need to do some fix in master while I am still developing new feature in branch. Should I commit this fix to only master or only branch or both ? So after I am done with branch, I want to merge it with master, and keep changes made in both. What should I do ?</p>  <p>I am using SVN, but I guess it is same for both SVN and GIT.</p>
