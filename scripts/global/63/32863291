<p>I've got a program that is looking at what files have changed in each SVN commit which will also highlight the area that has changed.</p>  <p>I'm passing that data that has been retrieved from SVN and placed it into a table in a sql server database.</p>  <p>what I'd like to do is compare the paths to see what area has been effected.</p>  <p>I've already got a table which has a path that shows what area has been effected.</p>  <p>Example:</p>  <p>SVN:</p>  <pre><code>branches/Projects/Enhancements2015Q1/WMDB/WMDB.cs </code></pre>  <p>this is the path that has been found by the code</p>  <p>Compare table</p>  <pre><code>branches/Projects/Enhancements2015Q1/GEM4/Utilities/Utilities.csproj = Utilities branches/Projects/Enhancements2015Q1/WMDB/WMDB.cs = WMDB trunk/src/GEM 4/GEM4/UI/Forms/AutoRenderOptionsForm.cs = UI </code></pre>  <p>So I'd like to find is that the path found in SVN has changed the WMDB.</p>  <p>any suggestions on how I could do this</p>
