<p>I am attempting to commit my XCode project to an Server based SVN.  I have it configured, open the Source Control window, and click on the 'Commit' button.  It chunks for a bit, then gives me the the error:  The working copy "xxx" failed to commit files.  Couldn't communicate with a helper application.</p>  <p>What is the helper application???</p>  <p>I've seen similar posts for GIT, but they don't seem to be relevant (or at least not enough info for me) to deal with SVN.</p>
