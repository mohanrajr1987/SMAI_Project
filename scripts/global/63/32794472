<p>I have an svn server hosted on an OpenSUSE server at work. It has been running for more than a year now with virtually no problems.</p>  <p>When I interact with the server (checkout, update, commit, etc.) at work, it is very quick to respond. When I access the same server from home over the internet (no VPN, directly via the svn protocol) the svn client on my Ubuntu machine connects and starts the task, and then there is a delay of around 5 minutes before it continues and completes the task.</p>  <p>I have restarted the server and client machines without any improvement. I can see svn starting up a new svnserve instance on the server when I request something from home. That instance then just sits there without doing anything before eventually responding in full.</p>  <p>My internet connection at home is not the problem. It is very responsive on all other up- and downloads.</p>  <p>This is strange to me, since this used to work without any problems before. Please help.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>  <p>Johan</p>
