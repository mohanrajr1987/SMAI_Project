<p>I have the following code to access SVN using SharpSVN</p>  <pre><code> AddHandler SVNclient.Authentication.SslServerTrustHandlers, Sub(ssender As Object, ev As SharpSvn.Security.SvnSslServerTrustEventArgs)                                                                         ev.AcceptedFailures = ev.Failures                                                                         ev.Save = True                                                                     End Sub  SVNclient.Authentication.ForceCredentials("user", "password") </code></pre>  <p>When I execute locally, I have no issues. When I deploy it to our test server, I get the following error</p>  <pre><code>Unable to connect to a repository at URL 'https://....' </code></pre>  <p>I am able to connect to the repo using TortoiseSVN  on the server.</p>  <p>Does anyone have any ideas on how to get around this? I would prefer to NOT have to force credentials if possible.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
