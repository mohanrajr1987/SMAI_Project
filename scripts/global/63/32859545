<p>We have configured the visualsvn server in remote machine, while accessing the repository from the browser in our local machine, we are getting the below error in the internet explorer browser</p>  <pre><code>'The XML page cannot be displayed'  Cannot view XML input using XSL style sheet. Please correct the error and then click the Refresh button, or try again later </code></pre>  <p>In the server machine's Event viewer, we found the log 'get /svnindex.xsl forbidden'. </p>  <p>Please note that we are able to connect the repository in TortoiseSVN &amp; other subversion command line tools.</p>  <p>Is any setup or permission is needed to browse the repository in the browser ?</p>
