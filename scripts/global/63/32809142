<p>How can I force TortoiseSVN to always add new subdirectories and folders when using the <code>TortoiseSVN &gt; Add...</code> context menu?  From time to time TortoiseSVN will simply <strong>not</strong> add new subdirectories, or files in the subdirectories, unless I repeatedly click the menu command multiple times.  Each click causes TortoiseSVN to include the next level of items.  Not sure if this is a setting, a bug, or user error.</p>  <p>Environment:<br> TortoiseSVN v1.9.1, Build 26747 - 64 Bit<br> Windows 8.1 Enterprise 64-bit</p>
