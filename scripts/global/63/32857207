<p>I was renaming my <strong>.xcodeproj</strong> file, unfortunately, it created two. I am unable to remove one. I simply delete it, but whenever I talk new checkout or update from SVN, it again shows two <strong>.xcodeproj</strong> files.</p>  <p>How can I remove on from <strong>XCode</strong>, so whenever I take update, or new checkout, it would show only one <strong>.xcodeproj</strong> file.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
