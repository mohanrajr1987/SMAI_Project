<p>I'm completely new to subversion and I'm unsure how to add and commit a Java Project to an online repository using svn. The goal is to move the important folders in the project including the src, package, and class. I've accessed the online repo and I (assume) I have it as a working copy. When I try to svn add the local project folders however, I am told it is not a working copy. How do I fix this? Is there a way I can make my workspace be the online repo directly? Or do I just copy the folder somehow? I'm using Cygwin and Eclipse. </p>
