<p>Is there a way that I would start transaction and commit like in a databases? I don't mean commit files but modifications on server directly. I need it for scripting purposes.  </p>  <p>For example:</p>  <pre><code>svn start-transaction svn mv server1/some_dir server1/some_dir2 svn cp server1/some_dir2 server1/some_dir3 svn cp server1/some_dir2 server1/some_dir4  and so on...  svn commit-transaction some error handle </code></pre>  <p>My point is if any of these commands fails, there will not be a change on server. Basically, database rollback if any of these commands fail.</p>  <p>Any suggestions?</p>
