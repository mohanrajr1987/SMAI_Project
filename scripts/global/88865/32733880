<p>SO i have my ionic Popup and upon firing enter button from my laptop keyboard, it resubmits the form from which fired the ionicPopup and refuses to close. why is this so? </p>  <pre><code>$ionicPopup.alert({   title: ' Required Field!',   template:'Invalid Email, Organization or Password.!' }) </code></pre>  <p>This was working before, it popups the alert and upon clicking on my laptop keyboard enter key, it closes the popup but now it is not working like that, it keeps refreshing and showing the popup. </p>
