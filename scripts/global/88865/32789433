<p>I load quite a few videos on the page, from youtube. I want to replace the div with placeholder, and only request the video when user clicks on the placeholder image.</p>  <p>I got this part working where it loads the video on ng-click, but it loads all of them, obviously. How do I load just the one that was clicked?</p>  <p>Here's my html inside ng-view and ng-repeat:</p>  <p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false"> <div class="snippet-code"> <pre class="snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override"><code>      &lt;figure class=" img-responsive"&gt;          &lt;iframe width="320" height="180" ng-src="{{item.VideoUrl | trusted }}"          frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="false" autoplay="0" ng-if="doplay"&gt;         &lt;/iframe&gt;                  &lt;img ng-src="images/logos/videoplaceholder.jpeg" height="180"          class="img-responsive" ng-if="!doplay" ng-click="setPlay()" /&gt;      &lt;/figure&gt;      &lt;script&gt;        $scope.setPlay = function (){         $scope.doplay = true;     }     &lt;/script&gt;</code></pre> </div> </div> </p>  <p>Like I said, the above works, but loads all the videos at once. I need to load just the one that was clicked. Thanks!!</p>
