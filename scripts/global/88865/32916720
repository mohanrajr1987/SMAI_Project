<p>I tried to change a $scope variable in Angular JS's ng-click function. But Angular </p>  <p>does not seem to be able to do that.</p>  <p>Below is my code on my appController:</p>  <pre><code>//  appController.js  $scope email = "Awesome@example.com";  $scope.emailInfo = "great@example.com";  //emailOnClick() is a ng-click on DOM. It will be triggered when the user click a button, which is to save his email information  $scope.emailOnClick = function() {      $scope.email = $scope.emailInfo;      console.log($scope.email); //this will print "great@example.com".  };  console.log($scope.email); // this will print "awesome@example.com", but I   //want it to print "great@example.com" as I triggered the ng-click function to   //apply the change.   console.log($scope.emailInfo); //this will print "great@example.com". </code></pre>  <p>What do I miss?  Any thought?</p>
