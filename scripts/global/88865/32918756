<p>I'm learning angulaJS by the video <a href="https://github.com/curran/screencasts/tree/gh-pages/introToAngular" rel="nofollow">Introduction to Angular.js in 50 Examples</a> , it's awesome but I'm confused since #46. We, say, want to get some nation's information from json file and display it, and we have a directive definition:</p>  <pre><code>countryApp.directive('country', function () {     return {         scope: {             country: '=country'         },         restrict: 'A',         templateUrl: 'country.html'     }; }); </code></pre>  <p>and we invoke the directive country in some html:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;ul&gt;     &lt;li ng-repeat="country in countries" country="country"&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; </code></pre>  <p>My question is: what the exact meaning of 4 different nouns "country" is? the first two in directive scope(country: '=country' ), the last two in html(country="country"). I understand the first one is just a variable definition in directive,  so it should be change to another name such as dir_country, but it can't work !</p>
