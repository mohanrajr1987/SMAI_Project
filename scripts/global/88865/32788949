<p>When I update my <code>$scope</code> like so in a controller</p>  <pre><code>$scope.item = "Hello"; </code></pre>  <p>Then the whole DOM for <code>item</code> seems to be removed and then added again. This seems fine, but if I have a list of <code>items</code> and do</p>  <pre><code>$scope.items = Resource.query();  </code></pre>  <p>To update all the items then all of the DOM for <code>items</code> is removed and then re-added, this looks a broken and clumsy - is there anyway around this removing and then adding of the DOM elements when <code>$scope</code> is updated?</p>  <p>This issue is further exasperated if <code>$scope.items</code> and its children are used inside several <code>ng-repeat</code> statements as all of those <code>ng-repeat</code> sections are removed and then re-added.</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>  <p>I have read this and feel that this is the issue <a href="https://www.binpress.com/tutorial/speeding-up-angular-js-with-simple-optimizations/135" rel="nofollow">https://www.binpress.com/tutorial/speeding-up-angular-js-with-simple-optimizations/135</a></p>  <p>That I have so much "stuff" going on the <code>$digest</code> is just slow. I am working on an example but in the mean time imagine this try of data</p>  <pre><code>{     {         id: 1,          name: "name1",          something: {             id: 10,             name: "something10"             else: {                 id: 15,                 name: "else15"             }         }     } } </code></pre>  <p>But there are 20 such objects all with nested objects - this appears to be the issue. That there are so many objects being parsed and bound to the DOM that the <code>$watchers</code> are just taking a long time to go over everything.</p>  <p><strong>EDIT 2</strong></p>  <p>I made this demo, perhaps I am using resource wrong? <a href="http://plnkr.co/edit/QOickL0Dyi8jmuvG9mzN" rel="nofollow">http://plnkr.co/edit/QOickL0Dyi8jmuvG9mzN</a></p>  <p>But the items are replaced every 5 seconds, on replace they all disappear and then reappear. This is the issue I am having.</p>
