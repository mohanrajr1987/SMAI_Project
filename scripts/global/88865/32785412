<p>I do not understand what is going on with my <code>$scope.isYellow</code> variable. Why it gets updated just fine but class <code>yellow</code> isn't added to an element?</p>  <p>Here is a jsfiddle: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/akctq645/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/akctq645/</a></p>  <p>The goal is simple: when you click on a "Color" <code>span</code>, it's background has to become yellow. I use <code>ng-class</code> and a custom directive to achieve it. My custom directive's scope has appropriate variable <code>isYellow</code> for that:</p>  <p><code>&lt;span id="spanElem" make-yellow-directive ng-class="{yellow: isYellow}"&gt;Color&lt;/span&gt;</code></p>  <pre><code>controller: function($scope, $element, $attrs, $transclude) {     $scope.isYellow = 0;     this.toggleIsYellow = function() {         $scope.isYellow = ($scope.isYellow == 1) ? 0 : 1;     } }, </code></pre>  <p>But whatever I do, it doesn't work. For some reason the variable <code>$scope.isYellow</code> in <code>this.toggleIsYellow</code> method gets updated but the <code>span</code> doesn't become yellow, <code>yellow</code> class is not added. Event if I toggle <code>$scope.isYellow</code> manually in Chrome Console debugger, class <code>yellow</code> doesn't appear on <code>span</code>. </p>  <p>Why? What is going on? It is the same scope, it's <code>isYellow</code> variable gets updated but why class <code>yellow</code> isn't added to <code>span</code>?</p>
