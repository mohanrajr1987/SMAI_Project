<p>I have a mesos cluster with 3 masters, <code>(.5,.6,.7)</code> and 4 slaves <code>(.15,.16,.17,.18)</code>. Everything is setup and running, I can start new docker containers and view them though the IP address and the port. Scale up and down. To finish this project I setup HaProxy according to <a href="http://open.mesosphere.com/getting-started/service-discovery/" rel="nofollow">this</a> document. It is working, I can see in the <code>/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg</code> that it is adding and removing as i launch and destroy containers. </p>  <p>In docker I use the following to set a hostname <code>"constraints": [["hostname", "UNIQUE", "example.com"]],</code> .</p>  <p>I setup a test domain and pointed it to the 3 master servers however when i browse to the domain it wont connect. I get the "unable to connect to server" error message. </p>  <p>In HaProxy it shows</p>  <pre><code>listen example.com-10001 bind 0.0.0.0:10001 mode tcp option tcplog balance leastconn server example.com-1 168.XXX.XXX.15:31192 check </code></pre>  <p>Is there something I am missing here?</p>
