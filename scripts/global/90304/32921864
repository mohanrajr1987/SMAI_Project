<p>I have a software that should be tested against a serious of WebDAV backends that are available as Docker containers. The lame approach is to start all containers within the before_install section like</p>  <pre><code>before_install: - docker run image1 - docker run image2 - ... </code></pre>  <p>This does not make much sense and wastes system resource since I only need to have only on particular docker container running as part of test run.</p>  <p>My test configuration uses a matrix...it is possible to configure the docker image to be run using an environment variable as part of the matrix specs? This boils down to two questions:</p>  <ul> <li>can I use environment variables inside steps of the before_install section</li> <li>is the 'matrix' evaluated before the before_install section in order to make use of environment variables defined inside the matrix</li> </ul>  <p>?</p>
