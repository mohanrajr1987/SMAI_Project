<p>I am trying to get started with docker and django. I followed the directions of docker-compose and created an image with a simple requirements.txt.</p>  <p>I now want to actually build out my app more and add templates and actual code.</p>  <p>1) i installed some modules on the host machine and added them to the requirements.txt file </p>  <p>2) i run (again) docker-compose run web django-admin.py startproject exampleproject. All my new requirements get downloaded but then i get this error:</p>  <p>/code/manage.py already exists, overlaying a project or app into an existing directory won't replace conflicting files</p>  <p>I am using the exact Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml as here: <a href="http://docs.docker.com/compose/django/" rel="nofollow">http://docs.docker.com/compose/django/</a></p>  <p>how am i supposed to update the container/image with new templates/views &amp;c and new modules as i am developing my app?</p>  <p>am i using docker wrong?</p>  <p>thanks.</p>
