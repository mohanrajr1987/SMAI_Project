<p>In UI, we have one pop-up window which opens after import completed. </p>  <p>Use-case: I wants to click on the link of pop-up window after import and then verify elements of pop-up window. </p>  <p>When I am running locally in IDE, all testcases of protractor are passing. But when i am running inside docker, it fails with "element not visible".</p>  <p>I have added <code>browser.actions().mouseMove(eleViewDetailBar).perform();</code> to navigate to that element but No luck.</p>
