<p>I use both Docker toolbox (latest) and Andy on my Windows 10 pro Laptop.</p>  <p>The problem is both the softwares strictly auto install their own custom virtualbox.</p>  <p>Docker installs VB version 5.x.x Andy installs VB version 4.x.x</p>  <p>Upon installations of these two packages, something is wrong, Now both are not working.....</p>  <p>Any solutions and suggestions, Thank you wink emoticon</p>
