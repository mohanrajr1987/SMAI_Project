<p>Please be gentle, I am new to docker.</p>  <p>I'm trying to run a docker container from within Python but am running into some trouble due to environment variables not being set.</p>  <p>For example I run</p>  <pre><code>import os os.popen('docker-machine start default').read() os.popen('eval "$(docker-machine env default)"').read() </code></pre>  <p>which will start the machine but does not set the environment variables and so I can not pass a docker run command.</p>  <p>Ideally it would be great if I did not need to run the <code>eval "$(docker-machine env default)"</code>. I'm not really sure why I can't set these to something static every time I start the machine.</p>  <p>So I am trying to set them using the bash command but Python just returns an empty string and then returns an error if I try to do <code>docker run my_container</code>.</p>  <p>Error:</p>  <pre><code>Post http:///var/run/docker.sock/v1.20/containers/create: dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: no such file or directory. * Are you trying to connect to a TLS-enabled daemon without TLS? * Is your docker daemon up and running? </code></pre>
