<p>It seems like there is no consolidated dashboard for monitoring Netflix OSS such as Zuul (I am only interested in monitoring the routes) , Eureka. Individually, services can be monitored via Hystrix (if they run on jvm).  Is there an equivalent for Javascript based services?  In addition, I would like to monitor the docker containers on all of the servers (Shipyard?? - Uses swarm which is in Beta so I am not sure whether to adopt at this stage).  Any suggestions?</p>
