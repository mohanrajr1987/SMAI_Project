<p>I have following docker engine and API version.</p>  <pre><code>{     "ApiVersion": "1.17",     "Arch": "amd64",     "GitCommit": "a8a31ef",     "GoVersion": "go1.3.3",     "KernelVersion": "3.19.0-30-generic",     "Os": "linux",     "Version": "1.5.0" } </code></pre>  <p>It shows the Engine version as 1.5.0 but the API version as 1.17. How should I upgrade the API to version 1.21? </p>  <p>I am using ubuntu 15.04.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
