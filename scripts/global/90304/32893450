<p>I am setting up a MariaDB Galera Cluster.  The ideal scenario is to have it running in a Docker container.  When I set it up <strong>outside</strong> of the Docker container, everything works fine -- my four (4) node cluster synchronizes and replicates.  However, when I try the same installation steps in the Docker container, the first node initializes just fine, but the second node fails to start.</p>  <p>The error that I am seeing in the logs is</p>  <pre><code>WSREP: 0.0 (db1):  State trasfer to 1.0 (db2) failed: -2 (No such file or directory) </code></pre>  <p>I have tried using both rsync and mysqldump as the replication methods.  I get the same error in both cases.</p>  <p>Some info:</p>  <ul> <li>OS:  CentOS 6</li> <li>Base image:  made from scratch bare bones</li> <li>Open ports:  3306, 4444, 4567</li> </ul>  <p>I am using the same configuration and the same yum install procedures in both cases.  Since my Docker container is bare bones, I have to install some extra utilities, but I am installing them just in case outside of the container, so that the installation steps remain the same.</p>  <p>Any help is very appreciated!</p>
