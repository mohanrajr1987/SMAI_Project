<p>I have modified, added some extra applications to a running container, now I would like to push it to Docker Hub. I have tagged my image like this: <code>docker tag hellodocker:mytag &lt;myuser&gt;/hellodocker:mytag</code> Pushing process was succesful, but after pull and run I see, that it contains only the base image, that I have used up, so intalled applications haven't "commited".</p>
