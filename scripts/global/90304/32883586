<p>Okay so I have enabled managing the docker daemon over HTTP by starting the daemon as follows:</p>  <pre><code>/usr/bin/docker -d -H fd:// -H=0.0.0.0:2376 </code></pre>  <p>I can create containers and remove them via the Remote API (i.e other calls are working fine) but if I try and pull an image it errors as follows:</p>  <pre><code> curl -v -X POST http://localhost:2376/images/create?from=ubuntu * Hostname was NOT found in DNS cache *   Trying 127.0.0.1... * Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 2376 (#0) &gt; POST /images/create?from=ubuntu HTTP/1.1 &gt; User-Agent: curl/7.38.0 &gt; Host: localhost:2376 &gt; Accept: */* &gt;  &lt; HTTP/1.1 200 OK &lt; Content-Type: application/json &lt; Date: Thu, 01 Oct 2015 09:01:02 GMT &lt; Transfer-Encoding: chunked &lt;  {"status":"Downloading from http://"} {"errorDetail":{"message":"Get http://: http: no Host in request URL"},"error":"Get http://: http: no Host in request URL"} * Connection #0 to host localhost left intact </code></pre>  <p>Anyone know what the answer is?</p>
