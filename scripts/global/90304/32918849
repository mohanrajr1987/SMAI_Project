<p>I am making graceful shutdown feature using GO lang when kebernetes doing rolling-update on google container engine. Does anyone know what process signal is sent to the running pods when kubectl rolling-update starts?</p>  <p>I've listened to os.Kill, os.Interrupt, syscall.SIGTERM, syscall.SIGKILL, syscall.SIGSTOP signals to be handled, none of those signals was raised while kubectl rolling-update.</p>  <p>I would really appreciate for your answers.</p>
