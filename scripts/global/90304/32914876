<p>I have successfully shelled into a RUNNING docker container using</p>  <p>docker exec -i -t 7be21f1544a5 bash</p>  <p>I have made some changes to some json files and wanted to apply these changes to reflect online.</p>  <p>I am a beginner and have tried to restart, mount in vain. What strings I have to replace when I mount using docker run?</p>  <p>Is there any online sample?</p>  <pre><code>CONTAINER ID: 7be21f1544a5 IMAGE: gater/web COMMAND: "/bin/sh -c 'nginx'" CREATED: 4 weeks ago STATUS: Up 44 minutes PORTS: 443/tcp, 172.16.0.1:10010-&gt;80/tcp NAMES: web </code></pre>
