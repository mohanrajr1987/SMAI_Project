<p>Question is about docker architecture and imo it's an advanced question.</p>  <p>I have an application running in docker containers. For the sake of simplicity let's assume there is only a postgresql image and a frontend image which are linked together just fine and the application is work as intended.</p>  <p>I want to add database dump/restore functionality to the UI.</p>  <p>I've read how to dump restore a database running inside a Docker container there are plenty of online sources for that. There are basically two approaches (with volumes or with a data container) but both methods relies on the ability of running docker commands.</p>  <p>However I wonder how should I implement it if I plan to add a dump / restore BUTTON to the UI (aka inside the frontend container) which should have the functionality of being able to save data and give a dump file back to user and reload a data provided by the user via browser interface.  How could the frontend container execute such a function? (there are some very nasty hacks, like you have access to underlying docker commands from within a container (but I consider those security flaws which will be likely purged from upcoming iterations of docker) )</p>  <p>What is the correct architectural approach to do such thing?</p>
