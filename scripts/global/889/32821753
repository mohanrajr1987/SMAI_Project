<p>I'm going to use a lot of powershell sentences with different output formats. And I only need few data of all the output in a console aplication (really is going to a windows aplication) and I thought to chatch the data using linq, because with Trim is going to be very caothict.</p>  <p>Any Idea, like pass the output to a text file, and use linq with this text file,  but this is goint to be less effective.</p>  <p>For example How I distinct the output related with any kind of window in this little script using linq or another trick</p>  <pre><code># # Script.ps1 # param( [string]$strComputer = ".")  Get-Process |      Where-Object {$_.MainWindowTitle -ne ""} |     Select-Object MainWindowTitle |     Out-String -stream </code></pre>
