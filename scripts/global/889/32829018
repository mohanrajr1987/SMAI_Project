<p>I want to call <code>IShellFolder.EnumObjects</code> from the background thread to avoid freezing the GUI thread in case enumerating takes extensive amounts of time.</p>  <p>The <code>IShellFolder</code> interface is obtained (and used) in the GUI thread. What is the proper way to pass its pointer to the background thread?</p>  <ol> <li><p>Marshal the interface pointer using <code>CoMarshalInterThreadInterfaceInStream</code>?</p></li> <li><p>Directly pass the interface pointer to another thread?</p></li> </ol>  <p>What about returned PIDL's - can they be safely exchanged between the threads?</p>  <p>Threads use STA threading model.</p>
