<p>I've played with PostMessage just clicking different tabs which seemed to work. But I'm trying to automate some button clicks and when running this function it highlights the button as if I was hovering over it but doesn't click. I thought somehow the button changing of colour made the boolean false so I added the exception of the buttons colour whilst it's hovered. Made no difference, and I do not wish to use SetCursorPos &amp; simulate a mouseclick using SendInput. I wish to understand the problem/issue I'm having as to why it's not clicking. </p>  <pre><code>void click(const std::vector&lt;uint_16&gt;&amp; x, const uint_16&amp; y) {     for(uint_8 i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++)     {         if(content::MyClass().firstMatch(GetPixel(hdc, x[i], y)))         {             PostMessage(hwnd, WM_LBUTTONDOWN, 0, MAKELPARAM(x[i], y));             return;         }     }     if(content::MyClass().secondMatch(GetPixel(hdc, x[4], y)))     {         PostMessage(hwnd, WM_LBUTTONDOWN, 0, MAKELPARAM(x[4], y));     } } </code></pre>
