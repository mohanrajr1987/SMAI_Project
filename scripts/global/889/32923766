<p>A lot of WinAPI objects, such as handles, events or sockets, is resource. I found it safe and efficient to wrap them in RAII classes.</p>  <p>Are there any pitfalls in doing that? Is it common practice or, instead, a bright, misleading idea? Or, maybe, there are already libraries for that? (Although I couldn't find anything worthy.)</p>  <p>Mostly, I'm interested in wrappers for 'small' objects like files, sockets, events and threads, that are not related to GUI or COM. Libraries like MFC or ATL may do such job but don't seem to be lightweight and no-overhead what I'm asking about.</p>
