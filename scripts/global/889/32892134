<p>I'm using the Windows API method <code>MonitorFromWindow(hwnd, MONITOR_DEFAULTTONEAREST)</code> as part of some overridden maximize functionality in my WPF application. One issue we've had with it is that the "nearest" window does not updating during drag operations (triggered by <code>DragMove</code> on the Window instance). </p>  <p>Suppose you drag the window between two screens of differing resolution and trigger the Aero Snap functionality on the second screen. This triggers a query on the window size (message <code>WM_GETMINMAXINFO</code>). Using <code>MonitorFromWindow</code> in this scenario returns the wrong screen. It's as if the data used by <code>MONITOR_DEFAULTTONEAREST</code> is not updated until the drag operation completes, and that doesn't complete until the resize function triggered by the Aero Snap completes. Is there some way to flush the current window position before answering the <code>WM_GETMINMAXINFO</code> query?</p>
