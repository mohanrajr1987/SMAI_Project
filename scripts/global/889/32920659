<p>How do I capture a hotkey with RegisterHotKey() and use in a function to immediately close the program ?</p>  <p>for some reason exit(0); is not working for me, it just always exit the program and dont make the validation; </p>  <p>RegisterHotKey(NULL, 1, MOD_ALT | MOD_CONTROL, 0x39) thats a bool and should return true when i press ctrl + alt + 9  the code is like </p>  <pre><code>void Close() { if(RegisterHotKey(NULL, 1, MOD_ALT | MOD_CONTROL, 0x39)) {      exit(0); } } </code></pre>
