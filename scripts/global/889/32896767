<p>I would like to hide a caret from a RichEdit(50W) with <code>ES_READONLY</code> style specified. It's pretty confusing for the user, when the caret is blinking and the user can't type.<br> I tried to hide the caret using <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms648403(v=vs.85).aspx" rel="nofollow">HideCaret()</a> function,<br> however it doesn't work for me with following code:  </p>  <pre><code>LRESULT CALLBACK ChatMessaegsSubclassProc(HWND hwnd, UINT msg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam) // Subclassed control {     LRESULT ret = CallWindowProc(WndProc_ChatMessages, hwnd, msg, wParam, lParam);     switch(msg)     {     //Also tried with EN_SETFOCUS     case WM_SETFOCUS:     {         ret = CallWindowProc(WndProc_ChatMessages, hwnd, msg, wParam, lParam);         HideCaret(ChatMessages); //Returns 5 (Access denied.)         break;     }      //According the documentation:     //If your application calls HideCaret five times in a row,      //it must also call ShowCaret five times before the caret is displayed.     case WM_KILLFOCUS: //The message is called when the RichEdit get focus, however nothing happens.     {         ret = CallWindowProc(WndProc_ChatMessages, hwnd, msg, wParam, lParam);         ShowCaret(ChatMessages);         break;     }     }     return ret; } </code></pre>
