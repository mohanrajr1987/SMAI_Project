<p>I've been scratching my head over this for a week now. I'm using the Windows API and I made a textbox with </p>  <p><code>editBox = CreateWindowEx(WS_EX_PALETTEWINDOW, TEXT("Edit"), NULL, WS_CHILD | WS_VISIBLE | WS_VSCROLL | WS_BORDER | ES_MULTILINE | ES_LEFT | ES_AUTOVSCROLL, 175, 110, 140, 150, hwnd, (HMENU) ID_TEXT, NULL, NULL);</code> </p>  <p>and a button </p>  <p><code>button = CreateWindowEx(WS_EX_PALETTEWINDOW, "BUTTON", "Ok", WS_TABSTOP | WS_VISIBLE | WS_CHILD | BS_DEFPUSHBUTTON, 175, 260, 140, 20, hwnd, (HMENU) ID_BUTTON, NULL, NULL);</code> </p>  <p>and I want to be able to click the button and it store what was typed into <code>editBox</code> in a primitive string. Examples are preffered but links and documentation are also very much appreciated! :)</p>
