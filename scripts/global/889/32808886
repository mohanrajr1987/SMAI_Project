<p>I'm writing multithreaded application in Windows environment. Worker loops are terminated by TerminateThread. I wonder how can I implement code that can not be interrupted to avoid data loss / memory problems : For example (pseudo code)</p>  <pre><code>while(true) { #NONINTERRUPTIBLE REGION  do something  #END OF NONINTERRUPTIBLE REGION #THREAD WILL BE INTERRUPTED THERE (even if call was made earlier) } </code></pre>  <p>I can't find any function in Windows API that can help to do this. Can somebody give me advice how to do this (boost libraries has this fucntion).</p>
