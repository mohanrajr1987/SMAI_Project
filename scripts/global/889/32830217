<p>We have an application that needs to "screen scrape" via some C# code.</p>  <p>In the application we are screen scraping there is an instance of ThunderRT6TextBox that according to WinSPY++ has a text value such as "Server: Oscar     Station: 1--------....".</p>  <p>When we use </p>  <pre><code>[DllImport("user32.dll", CharSet = CharSet.Auto, SetLastError = true)] private static extern int GetWindowText(IntPtr hWnd, [Out] StringBuilder lpString, int nMaxCount); </code></pre>  <p>and</p>  <pre><code>[DllImport("user32.dll", CharSet = CharSet.Auto, SetLastError = true)] private static extern int GetWindowTextLength(IntPtr hWnd); </code></pre>  <p>We get a value of <code>""</code> as the text for this control.  How is it possible our application sees one value for the caption/title/text on this control and WinSpy++ (or similar apps) see an actual value?  </p>  <p>Other text fields are read just fine in our application, it seems to only be this hidden field that returns <code>""</code>.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/3UyJi.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/3UyJi.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
