<p>I use RemoteApp (~RDP) to access to the remote application and then I try to simulate some user activity with keyboard. But remote application doesn't react on that activity anyhow.  The same simulation on the same application running locally works perfectly! But when I start to interact with the application remotely everything fails. I have tried:</p>  <ol> <li>SendKeys.SendWait(string)</li> <li>keybd_event(byte bVk, byte bScan, uint dwFlags, UIntPtr dwExtraInfo)</li> <li>SendInput and library over it InputSimulator (<a href="https://inputsimulator.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">https://inputsimulator.codeplex.com/</a>)</li> </ol>  <p>Nothing is good. The only one success is that remote application reacts on backspace.</p>  <p>Both machines are Win7 x64.</p>  <p>Do you have any suggestions or positive experience how to simulate keyboard activity with RDP-windows?</p>
