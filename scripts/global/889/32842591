<p>I need to inform user the system should be restarted in order to complete hardware installation. I don't want to reboot the system with <strong>InitiateSystemShutdownEx</strong> but rather to inform it like Windows Update does it with possible rescheduling etc.<br> Is there any standard way to do it? Application is started when system is started and user can log in after several hours or days. I want to trigger some notify for him to reboot now or later.<br> I don't know user credentials and application is started from service process. </p>
