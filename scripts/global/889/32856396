<p>I have created a thread, I want to listen to mouse messages my app receives.</p>  <p>However <code>PeekMessage</code> is never returning true. I even tried min and max filter of 0.</p>  <p>Here is my message loop:</p>  <pre><code>PeekMessage(LMessage, NULL, 0, 0, PM_NOREMOVE);  while (true) {      var rez = PeekMessage(LMessage, NULL, 0, 0, PM_REMOVE)      if (rez) {           // console.log('peekmessage true');      }      Sleep 1000; }  // console.log('message loop eneded'); </code></pre>  <p>As my hwnd is NULL i thought I should receive all messages to any window in my app, Im not getting anything though. Does anyone know whats up?</p>  <p>I also tried <code>GetMessage</code> approach:</p>  <pre><code>var rez = GetMessage(LMessage, NULL, 0, 0); console.log('rez:', rez); </code></pre>  <p>However it just hangs and never gets to the <code>console.log</code>.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
