<p>I am trying to make a little program that installs a global hook and catches keyboard input.  For now, I am trying to make every input changed to 'X' for example. So if i write anywhere "hello" it will actually write "XXXXX". I succeeded with hooking and even stopping any input from passing my hook but I can't figure out how to change the input.</p>  <p>The relevant method:</p>  <pre><code>IntPtr HookCallBack(int nCode, IntPtr wParam, IntPtr lParam) {         // Trying to change the input.         Marshal.WriteInt32(lParam, 88);          // Locked down         if (isKeyboardLockedDown)             return new IntPtr(1); // A non-zero return value blocks additional processing of key strokes.         // Not locked down.         else             return NativeMethods.CallNextHookEx(hookId, nCode, wParam, lParam);  } </code></pre>  <p>As written above - if I understand right - lParam is the address where the input key is stored. Therefor I overwrite it with "X". That method doesn't work for some reason. Any suggestions?</p>
