<p>I was initially using Charts JS but had to switch to ChartsNew because I needed bars of same dataset to be shown in different colors. Since the switch, it would appear that the option {scaleBeginAtZero : true} is not really working and the size of the canvas is somehow internally changed, meaning that while the canvas definition is:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;canvas id="Pie_Chart"  style="width:300px; height:300px;border: 1px solid gray;padding:5px 5px 5px 5px"&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt; </code></pre>  <p>when examining the element (Chrome) I find:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;canvas id="Pie_Chart" style="width: 300px; height: 150px; border: 1px solid gray; padding: 5px;" height="150" width="300"&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Note the additional <em>height="150" width="300"</em> at the end of the canvas tag.</p>  <p>Any clue as why {scaleBeginAtZero : true} is not working, where this resizing is this coming from and how to neutralize it? Thanks.</p>
