<p>Im using chart in C#. I want to display one series of data in Line chart type. I want to add new data to the series periodically, but want to display only the last 100. </p>  <p>I have done it by setting <code>axisX.maximum</code> to <code>series.count</code>, and the <code>axisX.minimum</code> to <code>axisX.maximum-100</code>. </p>  <p>Working well, but my problem is, that the major grid lines and labels of the X axis is in fixed position, and the labels are changing as I set a new min and max value for the X axis.<br> I would like to see "running" labels and grid lines, which follow the line of the data (so running together with the series graph).</p>  <p>Anyone knows, what I should set?<br> I tried the <code>IsMarksNextToAxis</code> property, but has no effect...</p>  <p>Thank you, Andras</p>
