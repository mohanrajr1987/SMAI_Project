<p>i'm working on a charting application which uses ms chart lib. the data comes from an access file over oledb connection. everythings works okay but i have to modify the y axis to displays data in time format.</p>  <p>Right now i'm storing data like:</p>  <p><code>string kw</code> for xvalue - these are the weeks</p>  <p><code>double kapazitat</code> for yvalue - these are the capacity values</p>  <p>I've tried to use add points and manipulate the y axis over a for loop to convert double to dateTime but it didn't work. </p>  <p>So all kinds of help i can appreciate! Thanks</p>
