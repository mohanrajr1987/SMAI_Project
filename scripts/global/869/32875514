<p>I've tried to gather information about if it is possible to put a different image located at the bottom of every column in a 100% stacked bar chart.</p>  <p>I've seen that is possible to modify some attributes of category labels and put images just above every bar as <a href="http://www.amcharts.com/demos/column-chart-images-top/" rel="nofollow">http://www.amcharts.com/demos/column-chart-images-top/</a> but I need just the opposite.</p>  <p>In other words, I want to make the base of the column has an image loaded, replacing x axis and category label.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
