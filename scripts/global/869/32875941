<p><a href="http://postimg.org/image/rp0i64g9b/" rel="nofollow">http://postimg.org/image/rp0i64g9b/</a> I am using jqPlot. I used the example <a href="http://www.jqplot.com/examples/line-charts.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.jqplot.com/examples/line-charts.php</a> but I reach problem. I have additional line. It's linear approximate, i guess. You can see them on bottom picture. Anyone had the same problem?</p>
