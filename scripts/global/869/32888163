<p>I'm looking for free/opensource charting libraries that allow realtime charts by adding data points with a single method.  Right now I'm using <a href="http://smoothiecharts.org/" rel="nofollow">Smoothie Charts</a>.  I chose it for it's ability to simply stream data, but as my product matures I'm hoping to add more features but do not want to lose that core simplicity of adding data.</p>  <p>My primary use case is a time-series, thus the requirements.  But I would like to find a single library that has this ability plus others.</p>  <p>In Smoothie Charts, I simply have a pubsub subscription that does <code>series.append(date,value)</code>.  I am looking for something similar so I don't have to change the rest of my "architecture".</p>
