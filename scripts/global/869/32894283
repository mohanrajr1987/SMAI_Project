<p>My original Excel bar chart looks like:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/WR7KF.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/WR7KF.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I want to add another series for 2014 data, as shown below:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/2enuL.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/2enuL.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I want the 2014 series to be scatter points overlaid on the original bar chart. However, when I add the 2014 series to the chart and change its chart type to Scatter, I obtain the following chart:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/uivia.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/uivia.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p><strong>How can I change the bar chart back to its varying palette of colors as it is in the original chart, and change the 'Current' axis label to its original format which lists the different categories?</strong></p>  <p>Ideally I'd want a time-efficient solution as I'll have to repeat this process with a number of similar charts. </p>
