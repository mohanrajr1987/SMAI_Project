<p>I have some data in a worksheet with which I need to create charts. These charts are going to populate different pages of a multipage in a userform. These pages need to be populated in the sequence the charts are created.</p>  <p>I have no difficulty with the charts and creating an image from them. I can copy that image to the first page (it already has an image object). In order to create a new page, I'm using the following code:</p>  <pre><code>MultiPage1.Pages.Add MultiPage1.Pages(0).Controls.Copy MultiPage1.Pages(k).Paste </code></pre>  <p>When I copy the controls, it also copies the previous image. That shouldn't be a problem as long as the new image gets replaced by the newly created chart image. The problem is, the new chart is being copied to the first page, not to the last one created (but this is not always the case... I don't understand). I tried to force the selection of the new page by using <code>UserForm2.MultiPage1.Value = k</code> but it's still not working.</p>  <p>Here is the code I wrote:</p>  <pre><code>Dim MyChart         As Chart Dim ChartData       As Range Dim ChartName       As String Dim thiswb          As Workbook Dim imageName       As String Dim nColunas        As Long        Dim i, j, k         As Integer   Set thiswb = ThisWorkbook  k = 0 With thisWb.Sheets(3) nColunas = .Cells(2, .Columns.Count).End(xlToLeft).Column For i = 1 To nColunas - 1 Step 3     If i &gt; 1 Then         MultiPage1.Pages.Add         MultiPage1.Pages(0).Controls.Copy         MultiPage1.Pages(k).Paste     End If     Set ChartData = .Range(.Cells(2, i), .Cells(95, i))     Set MyChart = .Shapes.AddChart(xlXYScatterLines).Chart     MyChart.SeriesCollection(1).Values = ChartData     MyChart.SeriesCollection(1).XValues = .Range(.Cells(2, i + 1), .Cells(95, i + 1))      imageName = Application.DefaultFilePath &amp; Application.PathSeparator &amp; "TempChart.gif"     MyChart.Export Filename:=imageName, FilterName:="GIF"     .ChartObjects(1).Delete      UserForm2.MultiPage1.Value = k     UserForm2.Image1.Picture = LoadPicture(imageName)     Kill imageName      k = k + 1 Next i End With </code></pre>  <p>If I have 4 charts to display, the final result will be: chart4/chart1/chart2/chart3 instead of chart1/chart2/chart3/chart4</p>
