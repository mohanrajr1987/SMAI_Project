<p>I am trying to make a spread <strong>sheet that will automatically update graphs based on the data</strong>.</p>  <p>I have some weekly data, however <strong>some weeks there will be data on Saturday and others not</strong>. This leads to a problem when trending the data with the trend dropping to zero on certain Saturdays.</p>  <p>I'm trying to solve this using VBA to define the Chart's data range, based on whether Saturdays data exists or not. However I cant find any good documentation on chart structure or methods</p>  <p>here is some vba code so far:</p>  <pre><code>Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal Target As Range)  Dim c As Integer  Application.EnableEvents = False Application.ScreenUpdating = False  If Cells(4, 8).Value &lt;= 0 Then     Worksheets(4).ChartObjects(7).Activate '****change chart data range to exclude Saturday****'   Else     Worksheets(4).ChartObjects(7).Activate '****change chart data range to include Saturday****'   End If  Application.ScreenUpdating = True Application.EnableEvents = True  End Sub </code></pre>
