<p>I have an attachment on <code>WebView</code>. When I tap on it, nothing happens. I do know <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9434487/open-pdf-in-a-webview"><strong>way</strong></a> to open attachment on WebView but the solution is condition based. Is there some solution to open it without placing condition because there are number of extensions attachment is supported in my app. <strong>I don't want the attachment to be downloaded.</strong><br> This is what I am doing right now and these are just few of the extensions:  </p>  <pre><code>if ((url.contains(".pdf") || url.contains(".xml") || url.contains(".xlsx") || url.contains(".docx") || url.contains(".ppt"))) {                             url = org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils.join("http://docs.google.com/gview?embedded=true&amp;url=", url);                             browser.loadUrl(url);                         } </code></pre>
