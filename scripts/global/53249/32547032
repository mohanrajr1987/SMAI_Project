<p>I am trying to inject javascript to automatically fill some textfields of a webpage that does not belong to me, and on which almost all ids have colons, which were apparently generated automatically, I don't know if it is jquery?</p>  <p>Anyway the point is I can't select the elements by their id like this:</p>  <pre><code>final String js = "javascript:document.forms[0].pt1:pt_cb2.click();"; </code></pre>  <p>OR</p>  <pre><code>final String js = "javascript:document.getElementById('pt1:pt_cb2').click());"; </code></pre>  <p>because the ":" is messing with the javascript and is not taking into account by it.</p>  <p>After reading most of google &amp; StackOverFlow related subjects and trying the different solutions, like escaping the : with \: or using querySelector etc... Nothing worked.</p>  <p>So to resume, how should I do to fill a webform with ":" ids automatically using android?</p>  <p>Thanks, </p>
