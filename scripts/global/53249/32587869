<p>I have the following form:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;form name="ProceedToPay" action="https://www.netcommercepay.com/iPAY/Default.asp" method="post" id = "ProceedToPay"&gt;    &lt;input type="hidden" name="city" value="&lt;?php echo $fields["city"]?&gt;"&gt; &lt;input type="hidden" name="country" value="&lt;?php echo $fields["country"]?&gt;"&gt; &lt;button id="submitBtn" type="submit"&gt;     Proceed to Netcommerce &lt;/button&gt; &lt;/form&gt; </code></pre>  <p>The fields are filling correctly the first time the webview opens. However, then user clicks on the button and goes to the next page, the next PHP file is not receiving the form! All the values from the form are null..</p>  <p>It's working correctly from both iPhone and the computer browser, but using Android's Webview is causing this to happen..</p>  <p>Why is it happening? And how is it solvable? </p>
