<p>I want to inject js script into web page of mobile browser on text-field focus event or browser page click event, using android Enhanced Web accessibility Permission.  It is possible and working with android app: "LastPass" URL:<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lastpass.lpandroid&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lastpass.lpandroid&amp;hl=en</a></p>  <p>I found permission details on android developer website but i did not found any code example.</p>
