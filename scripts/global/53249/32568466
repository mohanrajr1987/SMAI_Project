<p>I am trying to show some videos on web that need flash to be viewed. Unluckily I can't find anything possible.</p>  <p>Please kindly suggest me any library or exploit that can perform webView as External web browsers.</p>  <p>Javascript Enable and PluginState didn't work on those videos. But they all can be viewed in any external or original browsers.</p>  <p>Thank you for reading my problem, hoping to get some possible solutions.</p>
