<p>I use the Library richeditor (<a href="https://github.com/wasabeef/richeditor-android" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/wasabeef/richeditor-android</a>) which extends WebView to create a Rich Text Box.</p>  <p>When I type in the RichEditor (at runtime) the cursor goes down as new lines are added as expected.</p>  <p>If you take a text editor in a app like Evernote it automatically scrolls when newlines are added so that the cursor always stays in the screen and shown to the user.</p>  <p>Whereas in my app as I enter new lines the cursor goes down and ultimately go beneath the virtual soft keyboard so that I cannot see the cursor and the new text being typed. </p>  <p>How can I solve this.<a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/dWw0k.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/dWw0k.png" alt="Notice the light gray color cursor. Here when I add 2 another lines cursor goes behind the black toolbox. I need to scroll the whole screen to avoid that."></a></p>
