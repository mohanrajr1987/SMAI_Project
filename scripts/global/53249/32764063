On the app end...</p>  <ol> <li>The App is gonna ask for Name Email id and DOB the first time that it is executed, and this data is stored.</li> <li>I'm gonna create an Interface with a list of all the events and when a specific event is opened It will have a register button. </li> </ol>  <p>Now I wanna know how to send all the data collected in <em>part 1</em> and the event id from <em>part 2</em> to the official website.
