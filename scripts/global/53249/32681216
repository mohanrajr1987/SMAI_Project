<p>I have two different projects in my workspace. One project is a library project and the other project includes a reference to the library project.</p>  <p>In my library project, I have a class <code>Test</code>  defined as follows</p>  <pre><code>public class Test extends FragmentActivity {     ...     protected WebView mWebView; //need to access this object  } </code></pre>  <p>In my second project (that includes a reference to the library project) I need to access the object <code>mWebView</code> from within an <code>Activity</code> class. </p>  <p>How can I access the variable. Should I create an <code>Application</code> class. What is the best way to achieve this functionality.</p>  <p>Currently, I have done a temporary fix by creating a dummy static variable inside the class <code>Test</code></p>  <pre><code>public static WebView mTemp_WebView = null;  ... </code></pre>  <p>and assigning the value of <code>mWebView</code> to <code>mTemp_WebView</code></p>  <pre><code>    //TODO - replace this by getting instance of Activity class     mTemp_WebView = mWebView; </code></pre>  <p>I know this is not the correct way. can someone tell me how to implement this functionality in Android?</p>
