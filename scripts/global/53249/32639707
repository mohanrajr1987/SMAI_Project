<p>In our app sometimes the html pages displayed with webview are not shown properly. The use case is as following: <br> When I need to show a html message inside a webview(an email message) the page sometimes doesn't render properly and it doesn't show the original message at all. The loadData is run on UI thread so no worries about that. <br> I tried everything, no luck so far.</p>
