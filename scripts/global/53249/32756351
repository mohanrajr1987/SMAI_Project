<p>I'm working with Android WebView to show web version of my site. And I'm using following code to prevent open default browser popup option and to load all the webpage ( user can click on other links within the website ) within the same webview.</p>  <pre><code>    public boolean shouldOverrideUrlLoading(WebView view, String url) {         if(Uri.parse(url).getHost().endsWith("sample.com")) {             return false;         }          Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, Uri.parse(url));         view.getContext().startActivity(intent);         return true;     } </code></pre>  <p>Above code is working fine. But the issue is, I'm using <a href="http://www.plupload.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.plupload.com/</a> (UI widget) to upload images from my web site. Now when i click on the "Add files" from this widget the uploading options are not showing and not working. But if I remove above code "shouldOverrideUrlLoading" method and click on "Add files" it is showing to upload image from gallery or from camera and it is working perfectly. But now the web pages are open in default browser rather than with in the webview. </p>  <p>Anyone has this problem before? What will be the solution? </p>
