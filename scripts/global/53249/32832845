<p>i've been in a trouble for some days to understand this issue. Basically i have a <code>Webview</code> which loads a website, with the first page being the login and the content follows after the login. </p>  <p>Every user validation is made through the site it self. So there is nothing to be saved in a <code>SharedPreference</code> for example. Im only using the url in this scenario.</p>  <p>so onCreate after killing my app , the webview is not restoring the previous state before it was killed.</p>  <p>I suppose its because the savedinstancestate is coming null, and is loading the url again after the app being killed.</p>  <p>I have the session cookies and other stuff.</p>  <p>i was wondering if someone has some suggestion.</p>  <p>p.s.I'm new in Android. </p>
