<p>I have DATE type column in a MySQL database table with dates stored in it. I am using the YYYY-MM-DD format when I upload the dates to the database.</p>  <p>When I check the values they are stored in the correct and expected format (2005-01-02), however when I am attempting to read these values with my C++ program I am receiving something like this: 02/01/2005 00:00:00</p>  <p>I don't really understand the reason, I thought in the DATE type only the YYYYMMDD gets stored without the time. The other weird thing is the reformatting I thought YYYY-MM-DD is an accepted format.</p>  <p>Here is my code:</p>  <pre><code>String^ getDateOfBirth = myReader-&gt;GetString("player_date_of_birth"); DateOfBirthLabel-&gt;Text = getDateOfBirth; </code></pre>  <p>I am using Visual Studio 2013.</p>  <p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
