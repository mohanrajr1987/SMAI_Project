<p>I have a small program that I made with Java and intend to have it run on any computer that it is downloaded to. Part of this program connects to a MySQL Database that is running on my localhost. However, since I want this to be able to run smoothly on any computer that is connected to the internet, it is probably necessary that I have my program connect to the database over the internet. Currently, my program connects to the database like this:</p>  <pre><code>Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://my_public_ip/name_of_database", "user", "user_password"); </code></pre>  <p>The user named 'user' for my database has a host of '%', which I understand means any host. However, when I run the program on a computer that is connected to a different network than the one mine is connected to, I get a Communications Link Failure. Just for reference, I use xampp software to administer my database. Thanks in advance for any help on this matter.</p>
