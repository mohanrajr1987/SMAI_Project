<p>I have a table containing columns for books, series, and dates published. I'd like to make a query to the table that gets the 3 latest books per series. You'd get something like this where its first organized by series, then by date then limited to 3 distinct copies per Series.</p>  <p>Any thoughts?</p>  <pre><code>Book 63, Series 1, 10/3/2015 Book 27, Series 1, 10/2/2015 Book 33, Series 1, 10/1/2015 Book 41, Series 2, 10/3/2015 Book 21, Series 2, 10/2/2015 Book 33, Series 2, 9/10/2015 </code></pre>
