<p>I have a table with D_Number being the corresponding to the day number in the year.</p>  <pre><code>Date       D_Number     Schedule 9/24/2015   267            3T 10/15/2015  288            2R 11/5/2015   309            PR </code></pre>  <p>I have the following query.</p>  <pre><code>$day_num=date("z")+1;  $query_Recordset2 = "SELECT * FROM b_schedule_dates WHERE       b_schedule_dates.D_Number = $day_num"; </code></pre>  <p>Basically, if today was 10/15/2015 or day number 267, the schedule to be followed is 3T.</p>  <p>I have a second query that is looking for the schedule to echo.</p>  <pre><code>$day= date('w'); $day_num=date("z")+1; $sched=$row_Recordset2['Schedule']; $d_number=$row_Recordset2['D_Number'];  if($day_num === $d_number){     $s=$sched;  }else {     $s="2R"; }  if (isset($s)) {     $colname_Recordset1 = $s; }  $query_Recordset1 = sprintf("SELECT * FROM b_schedule WHERE b_schedule.Schedule =%s" </code></pre>  <p>What am I doing wrong? It does not seem to recognize the 1st query's $day_num. I just want it to follow the corresponding schedule if the date happens, with each date having its own distinct schedule. If not it just needs to follow schedule 2R. b_schedule just has different schedule with different start and end times based on the schedule.</p>  <pre><code>Start     End      Schedule 8:00:00   9:30:00     3T 8:00:00   10:30:00    2R 8:00:00    2:30:00    PR </code></pre>
