<p>Yet another upgrade of OSX (to El Capitan) has fudged MySQL.  The datadir is in a new location.  I'd like to set the datadir back to where my known tables are.  </p>  <p>entered the following into support-files/mysql.server as well as /etc/my.cnf:</p>  <pre><code>datadir=/usr/local/mysql/data </code></pre>  <p>Unloaded and re-loaded the daemon and it still isn't taking.</p>  <p>Anybody have any advice?</p>  <p>Cheers</p>
