<p>I am modifying an existing plugin and I want to add a new field to the form and then have that field be submitted along with the post. The post gets submitted to wp_posts. I have read on Google that to do this one simply needs to use <code>update_post_meta</code>. I am trying to insert data into a new column I made in PHPMyAdmin. I named the column <code>post_amount</code>. The field name is <code>amount_field</code>. Although I'm a beginner, something about "just use <code>update_post_meta</code>" that I've read seems too simple to be all that I need. But I might be wrong. Maybe I'm using it wrong?</p>  <pre><code>$question_array = array(             'post_title'        =&gt;  $fields['title'],             'post_author'       =&gt;  $user_id,             'post_content'      =&gt;  apply_filters('ap_form_contents_filter', $fields['description']),             'post_type'         =&gt;  'question',             'post_status'       =&gt;  $status,             'comment_status'    =&gt;  'open',         );          if(isset($fields['parent_id']))             $question_array['post_parent'] = (int)$fields['parent_id'];          $question_array = apply_filters('ap_pre_insert_question', $question_array );          $post_id = wp_insert_post($question_array);          $post_amount = $fields['amount_field']; //My code          update_post_meta($post_id, 'post_amount', $post_amount); //My code </code></pre>
