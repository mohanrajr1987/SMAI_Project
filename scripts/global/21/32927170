<p>The following query orders votes based on how many times users voted... I would like to know the # in the queue of the specific user.</p>  <pre><code>SELECT @s:=@s+1 serial_number, user_id, COUNT(slug_owner) as cnt  FROM `votes_queue`,(SELECT @s:= 0) AS s  GROUP BY slug_owner ORDER BY cnt DESC   serial_number | user_id | cntÂ  3 | 19 | 8 2 | 14 | 4 1 | 13 | 2 </code></pre>  <p>Essentially i need the numbers in the serial_number column to be reversed so I can tell that user 13 is #3 based on votes ..</p>
