<p>i have a mysql table as follows(5 coloumns):</p>  <blockquote>   <p>id |Vehicle_no |Time                 | latitude    |Longitude</p>      <p>1  |Abc123     |2015-09-15 20:15:51 |  26.211718   | 86.877197</p>      <p>2  |Abc123     |2015-09-15 20:16:51 |  26.211718   | 86.877197</p>      <p>3  |Abc123     |2015-09-15 20:17:51 |  26.211718   | 86.877197</p>      <p>4  |Abc123     |2015-09-15 20:18:51 |  26.211718   | 86.877197</p>      <p>5  |Abc123     |2015-09-15 20:19:51 |  26.211718   | 86.877197</p>      <p>6  |Abc123     |2015-09-15 20:20:51 |  26.212718   | 86.878197</p>      <p>7  |Abc123     |2015-09-15 20:21:51 |  26.212728   | 86.878200</p>      <p>8  |Abc123     |2015-09-15 20:22:51 |  26.212738   | 86.877201</p> </blockquote>  <p>the above values i am getting from a gps receiver every minute. if the latitude and longitude remains same say for e.g more than 5 minutes at a particular day i must indicate that the vehicle is stationary at this location (lat. and long.) on this particular date. in table for id. no 6, 7 there is different lat. and long which means vehicle is moving. the values of lat. and long may be repeated because i am crossing the same route everyday(same lat. and long.) but the time and date may be different.</p>
