<p>I have an alert menu to show new things for users. It is a PHP system like ebay.</p>  <p>So I have sell table:</p>  <pre><code>id seller customer product_name date </code></pre>  <p>What I want is to show for each user an menu with alerts with new sells. For this too work I can:</p>  <p>method 1:</p>  <p>Add SEEN column in sell table, set it as 0 on insert, and when USER clicks in alert menu it will scan table to set SEEN as 1.</p>  <pre><code>update sell set seen = 1 where seen = 0 and user = ? </code></pre>  <p>method 2:</p>  <p>record last time(date) user clicks on alert menu, than select new alerts where date > last_date_click:</p>  <pre><code>select * from sell where date &gt; $last_date_click and user = ? </code></pre>  <p>So, my question is, what is the best way (FASTER, MORE accuracy) to show NEW alerts for user?</p>
