<p>Upon attempting to export a schema diagram for use in a database, I am met with an error:</p>  <p>"Could not save to file 'CIS235.sql': Failed to create file 'CIS235.sql.XTM25X': Permission denied"</p>  <p>Is it a possibility that this error is a result of conflicting user or permission settings?   I've tweaked most options around and haven't had any successful results.</p>  <p>Interestingly enough, I am able to click the "Save to Other File" button and save it to an alternate location and then gain access to the script file.</p>  <p>But I don't feel that this is the correct way to utilize this function- I'd like to be able to access the diagram directly within the connections under the schema pane.  I'm not able to do that due to this error.</p>  <p>Any ideas are appreciated.  Thanks.</p>
