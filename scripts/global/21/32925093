<p>I have a php application which connects to a database which has only two tables : <code>users</code> and <code>folders</code>. When you login in the application and press a button, a huge number of records are being inserted in the <code>folders</code> table. The process takes about 15 minutes to complete. In this time, all the application gets stuck. In my application's header I have something like </p>  <pre><code>select * from users where id = {$_SESSION['user_id']} </code></pre>  <p>but until those tens of thousands of records are inserted in the <code>folders</code> table, the second query just isn't executed. After I wait 15 minutes and the import gets done, I can acces any page I want. How can I fix this problem? </p>
