<p>Hy,</p>  <p>I'm facing A problem that I can't solve in EF5.0 database first.</p>  <p>I've 2 tables : T_LOCATION(LOC_ID, LOC_CODE, LOC_NAME, ...) and T_PLANT (PLT_ID, PLT_LOC_ID, PLT_SERVERNAME, PLT_SERVERIP) with a foreign key between the "LOC_ID" and "PLT_LOC_ID" fields.</p>  <p>I wanna have 2 entities in my model : Location (Id, Code, Name, ...) and Plant (PlantId, ServerName, ServerIP) with Plant which inherit from Location.</p>  <p>I've made exactly the same of this <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/cc716702%28v=vs.100%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">MSDN Walkthrough</a>. But I've 2 errors due to my primary key in the Plant table: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Error 3002 : Problem fragments mapping from the line in 1550: Potential Violation of key runtime (T_PLANT.PLT_ID) of T_PLANT table: columns (T_PLANT.PLT_ID) are mapped to properties (T_LOCATION.PlantId) of EntitySet T_LOCATION side conceptual, but do not form key properties of EntitySet (T_LOCATION.Id).</p>      <p>Error 3003: Mapping Problem fragments from the line 1550: All key properties (T_LOCATION.Id) of EntitySet T_LOCATION must be mapped to the set of key properties (T_PLANT.PLT_ID) of the table T_PLANT .</p> </blockquote>  <p>I tried a lot of things (delete and recreate entities, create manually them...) but without any positive result. Thank's for your help.</p>
