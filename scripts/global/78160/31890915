<p>I want to create a new convention like <code>SchemaFromNamespaceConvention</code> in Entity Framework. It should work in a way that if my entity is <code>Accounting.Invoice</code>, so uses Table mapping as it was annotated like:</p>  <pre><code>namespace Accounting {     [Table("Invoices", "Accounting")]    // Using the convention, I should be able to remove this     public class Invoice{...} } </code></pre>
