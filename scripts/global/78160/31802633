<p>I am upgrading from EF 5 to EF 6. Previously I was using SQL Anywhere 12, and now I am using SQL Anywhere 17. I upgraded EF version, upgraded SQL anywhere version, but when I build, I get this error</p>  <pre><code>Unable to cast object of type 'Sap.Data.SQLAnywhere.SAProviderServices' to type 'System.Data.Common.DbProviderServices'. </code></pre>  <p>I have followed this tutorial</p>  <p><a href="http://dcx.sap.com/index.html#sqla170/en/html/37fb9e8558e94547b66156b9298be16f.html" rel="nofollow">http://dcx.sap.com/index.html#sqla170/en/html/37fb9e8558e94547b66156b9298be16f.html</a></p>  <p>I installed SQL Anywhere provider which is required by EF 6. It is integrated to VS. I can make a connection using server explorer. But my edmx is not working fine. I removed my existing edmx and created a new one. But I still get this error. How to fix this error?</p>
