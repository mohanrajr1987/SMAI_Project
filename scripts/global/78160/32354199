<p>Should I keep all navigation properties that Entity generated or just keep only these I really want ?</p>  <p>For example :</p>  <ul> <li>I've 2 entities : Location (Id, Code, Name, IdType) and Location type (Id, Code, Name).</li> <li>Entity generates a "Type" property for the entity "Location" and "Locations" property (collection) for the entity "Location type".</li> </ul>  <p>If I'd built my model myself, I'd created the first, but probably not the second. So should I keep it or delete it?</p>  <p>Maybe it's like the “Include foreign key column in the model” option. In my opinion, I don't see the utility of this, this even seems to me to be contrary to the development logic. However, I read <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4675437/using-include-foreign-key-column-in-the-model-option-in-ef-wizard">here</a> that I should let it checked.</p>
