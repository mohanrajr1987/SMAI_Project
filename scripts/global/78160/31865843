<p>I've got a sql database that contains some spatial data. I also have an application that uses entity framework to generate the ORM mapping for this database. Every time I try to run the application I get the following error "System.Data.Spatial.DbGeometry cannot be serialized because it does not have a parameterless constructor." I understand why the error is happening, but what I don't know is how to fix it. All the code in my .edmx file is generated by visual studio. What do I need to do to be able to serialize the data in my geometry column?</p>
