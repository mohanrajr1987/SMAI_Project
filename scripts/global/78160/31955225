<p>I am trying to subscribe to Query Notification using SqlDependency. My application is written in c# and I am using Entity Framework 5.0 to connect and perform CRUD operations. I have enabled SERVICE BROKER on the database.</p>  <p>I am using 'sa' account so no permissions need to be granted, however as it is not working I tried creating another user and granted all necessary permissions. It still does not work.</p>  <p>I have been using the same code for a while, it always worked for me. Even now I have a test database on the same server to which I can subscribe for the notification. However for this particular database it does not work.</p>  <p>I can connect to the database and perform CRUD. But when I try to subscribe to Query Notification it throws the following exception</p>  <blockquote>   <p>"Login failed for user 'sa'."   (System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException)  Exception Message = "Login failed   for user 'sa'.", Exception Type =   "System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException", Exception WinRT Data = null</p> </blockquote>  <p>Not sure what the 'WinRT' is at the end.</p>  <p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
