<p>I am pretty new to Entity Framework. I know how to use it generally and also managed to call stored procedures.</p>  <p>However, due to business reasons (legacy DB), we are having majority of business logic in stored procedures, which means C# code is limited to calling stored procedures with appropriate parameters and getting results.</p>  <p>So, I wanted to understand from gurus and their practical experience, apart from having ready-made objects created which can be used for processing, what advantage will it offer in such case?</p>  <p>Thanks for sharing knowledge :-)</p>
