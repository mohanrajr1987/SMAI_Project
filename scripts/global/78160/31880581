<p>There has been an issue I have been facing with entity framework. I have inherited a project which I have to enhance and I am facing a weird issue. The first time the visit model is accessed and when the virtual property Reports is accessed, it takes like a minute to run. After that any subsequent times this property is called, it is fast(1-1.5 seconds). The models in question are as below:</p>  <pre><code>//Visit model public class Visit : ModelTrackingBase {      [Column("VISITDATE")]     [RequiredDateTimeAttribute(ErrorMessage = "Date can't be blank")]     public DateTime VisitDate { get; set; }      [Column("STATUS")]     public long Status { get; set; }      [Column("OWNERID")]     public long OwnerId { get; set; }      [Column("COORDID")]     public long? CoordinatorId { get; set; }      [Column("REPORTID")]     public long ReportId { get; set; }      [Column("ASSETID")]     [Range(1, long.MaxValue, ErrorMessage = "Asset can't be blank")]     public long AssetId { get; set; }      [Column("ASSETTYPE")]     [MaxLength(50)]     public string AssetType { get; set; }      public virtual Report Report { get; set; }//this is the one that causes the lag  } </code></pre>  <p>Then we have the model reports which is as follows:</p>  <pre><code>//model reports public abstract class Report : ModelTrackingBase {     [Column("TYPENAME")]     [MaxLength(60)]     public string TypeName { get; set; }       public virtual ICollection&lt;Crewship&gt; Crewships { get; set; }     public IEnumerable&lt;User&gt; KeyPersonnel     {         get { return Crewships.Select(c =&gt; c.User); }     }      public virtual ICollection&lt;Reviewship&gt; Reviewships { get; set; }     public IEnumerable&lt;User&gt; ReviewTeam     {         get { return Reviewships.Select(r =&gt; r.User); }     }     } </code></pre>  <p>I will also show the subsequent models that the code gets data from:</p>  <pre><code>public class ModelTrackingBase : EntityIdBase {     protected ModelTrackingBase()     {         CreatedAt = UpdatedAt = DateTime.Now;     }       [Column("CREATEDAT")]     public DateTime CreatedAt { get; set; }     [Column("UPDATEDAT")]     public DateTime UpdatedAt { get; set; }  } </code></pre>  <p>Then we have the reviewships and crewships models:</p>  <pre><code> public class Reviewship : ModelTrackingBase {     [Column("USERID")]     public long UserId { get; set; }      [Column("REPORTID")]     public long ReportId { get; set; }      [Column("NOTIFYADDED")]     public DateTime? NotifyAdded { get; set; }       public virtual User User { get; set; }     public virtual Report Report { get; set; } } </code></pre>  <p>Crewships is same except the notifyadded property. <strong>It takes a minute to access the property Visits.Report whenever that model is called to data-bind on the view-model, any subsequent calls are 1 second long</strong>. Any help is appreciated as this has been bugging me for a week now.</p>
