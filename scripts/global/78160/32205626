<p>My Db layer is a MySQL Db. I am using Entity Framework to grab the data from the Db and then using a WCF service I am relaying my data as JSON through my IIS server.</p>  <p>This data is then handled through AJAX and Knockout JS and updates my view however often I want. </p>  <p>My question is that if my data is coming from an external source and constantly changing, how do I get Entity Framework to see these changes and push them to my mapped entity in my WCF service?</p>  <p>Let me know if anything is unclear about this.</p>
