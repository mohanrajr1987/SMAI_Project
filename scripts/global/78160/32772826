<p>I am using Entity Framework 5 code first to talk to an Oracle 11g or 12c database (I've verified the problem in both versions). The Oracle field is a <code>FLOAT</code> type while the field in my POCO is a <code>decimal</code>. I'm using <code>decimal</code> because I need my decimal places to be accurate up to 5 digits.</p>  <p>When I save my entity, the resulting record in the database always rounds the value to 2 decimal places.</p>  <p>I have verified through a database tool (Toad) that the column will support precision of 5. I cannot change the data type in the database due to backwards compatibility. I have found that using a <code>double</code> does not have the same problem. But <code>double</code> is notorious for giving inexact numbers, especially when multiple mathematical operations are performed.</p>  <p>Does anyone know why a <code>decimal</code> value would be truncated? I am using the Oracle data provider.</p>
