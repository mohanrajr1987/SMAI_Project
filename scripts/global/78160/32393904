<p>I am using EF spatial data types DbGeometry and DbGeography in my application. Now I tried to upgrade from EF5 to EF6. The project compiles (after I swapped all System.Data.Entity referencies to new ones of EF6), but at runtime when I try to access DbGeometry.IsEmpty I get NotImplemetedException. From refactored assemblies I found out, IsEmpty calls private field spatialProvider, which has two implementations - DefaultProvider and SqlServerProvider. Default one throws the exception. So how can I instruct EF to use the SqlServer one?</p>  <p>Couple of words for my architecture: Server communicates with DB via EF. On server it seems to work fine also, it's where I have EDMX and create all EF stuff. Than it sends a DTO to client via WCF, this DTO has a DbGeometry property. Than on client (WPF) I call IsEmpty on this DTO property and... exception. Is there some config or sth, coz on the client I don't have any EF schemas etc, just a reference to EntityFaramework 6 spatial types DLL.</p>  <p>PS: I do load unmanaged SQLTypes assemblies on the client also.</p>
