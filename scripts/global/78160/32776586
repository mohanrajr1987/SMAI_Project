<p>I am new to Entity-Framework-5 and IdentityDbContext, I have managed to create my and create the AspNet membership tables,then i changed the type in one of the properties of the model, now my project wont run and its telling me that I need to run migrations. My question is, how to run migrations on the IdentityDbContext? I cant find any good guides on how to do it.</p>  <p><code>Additional information: The model backing the 'ApplicationIdentityUserDbContext' context has changed since the database was created. Consider using Code First Migrations to update the database (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=238269).</code></p>  <p><code>public class ApplicationIdentityUserDbContext : IdentityDbContext&lt;UserProfile&gt;     {         public ApplicationIdentityUserDbContext()             : base("DefaultConnection")         { }     } </code><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/9LuA8.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/9LuA8.png" alt="enter image description here"></a> I have attached the error when I run enable-migrations.</p>
