<p>I followed this tutorial <a href="http://www.allenconway.net/2013/01/separating-entity-framework-poco.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.allenconway.net/2013/01/separating-entity-framework-poco.html</a> for splitting my Entities and POCO into seperate projects. But every single time I get an error in my .context.tt for my DbSet Objects:</p>  <pre><code>Error   3   The type or namespace name could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)  </code></pre>  <p>I have changed the namespace for the .context.tt I tried adding a using statement as well. I also added a reference as well.</p>  <p>any idea how I can resolve this ?</p>
