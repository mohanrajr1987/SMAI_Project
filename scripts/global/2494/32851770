<p>as a total JavaScript beginner, how do I actually develop for it? I mean, I've seen <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/documentdb-programming/" rel="nofollow">https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/documentdb-programming/</a> but there was no mentioning of a development environment.</p>  <p>Is there something like a visual studio project template for server-side javascript?</p>
