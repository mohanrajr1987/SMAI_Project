<p>A developer has included a DB password within a stored procedure (rolls eyes). We include a backup of this database with our setup application for new customers. We've updated the stored procedure, but the password is still visible in plain text within the backup file as this includes both the current stored procedure <em>and</em> the original one.</p>  <p>We've cleared transaction history and recreated the log file, but these don't seem to affect historical stored procedure code. Is there some way of removing this from the DB backup?</p>  <p>Thanks <em>very much</em> in advance for any suggestions! We've hunted around and drawn a blank so far.</p>
