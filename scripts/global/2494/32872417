<p>I've manipulated my data into the format I need it using a view, and now I have a simple insert query to write that data to a table: </p>  <pre><code>insert into mytable select * from myview where  (myview.[date] &gt; (select max([date]) from mytable)) and  (myview.[date] &lt; getdate()) </code></pre>  <p>I'd like this to run automatically on a daily basis. I am a bit new to this, but my understanding is that I need to utilize a stored procedure. I am not sure how to execute this code in my stored procedure, though. When I create a new stored procedure, I'm given this template:</p>  <pre><code>CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[Update]     @param1 int = 0,     @param2 int AS     SELECT @param1, @param2 RETURN 0 </code></pre>  <p>Could someone help me understand how to bridge from query to stored procedure?</p>
