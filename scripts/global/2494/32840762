<p>I have a stored procedure exports some data in a table. What i want to ensure is even if the table doesn't exists, it will be created. If it exists, I don't want the procedure to return <code>There is already an object named 'myFinalTable' in the database.</code>  In order to check I'm doing this:</p>  <pre><code>if not exists (SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES             WHERE TABLE_NAME = N'dbo.myFinalTable') begin select *  into dbo.myFinalTable from #someTempIhaveDataIn end </code></pre>  <p>then I used </p>  <pre><code>drop table dbo.myFinalTable  </code></pre>  <p>and ran it once. It worked, then I ran it again (the procedure) and it gave me the error mentioned above (there is already an object named..)</p>
