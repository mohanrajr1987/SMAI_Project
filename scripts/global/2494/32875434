<p>I use SQL Server 2012 Express with SSMS.</p>  <p>A stored procedure returns error only if is executed by a user with limited GRANTS.</p>  <p>These are:</p>  <pre><code>GRANT CONNECT   ON DATABASE::[SAR]  TO Employees AS [dbo] GRANT DELETE    ON SCHEMA::[dbo]    TO Employees AS [dbo] GRANT EXECUTE   ON SCHEMA::[dbo]    TO Employees AS [dbo] GRANT INSERT    ON SCHEMA::[dbo]    TO Employees AS [dbo] GRANT SELECT    ON SCHEMA::[dbo]    TO Employees AS [dbo] GRANT UPDATE    ON SCHEMA::[dbo]    TO Employees AS [dbo] </code></pre>  <p>Debug is not available with these permissions.</p>  <p>To make available Debug I must  run</p>  <pre><code>exec sp_addsrvrolemember 'Employees', 'sysadmin' </code></pre>  <p>After this command Debug is available , but the error does not happen anymore.</p>  <p>Any suggestions?</p>  <p>Thank you</p>
