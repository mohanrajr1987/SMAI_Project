<p>I have a SQL Server 2012 stored procedure that returns a table. I have to modify that SP to add an additional value to the returned table. Unfortunately, that added value comes from a call to a web-service. From my research, I gather the main ways to do this are using the OLE Automation procedures (sp_OA...) in SQL, or a SQLCLR stored procedure. Given the security context in which the sp_OA... procedures run, the single return value is a VARCHAR(10) registration key, and calls to the service are few (ten to twenty per hour), I'm guessing the SQLCLR method is the way to go. Also, the web-service is hosted on our intranet, and not accessible to the outside world. </p>  <p>Is there a better way to accomplish what I need? Better meaning more performant, better security, easier to code and maintain</p>
