<p>I ran into this design questions. Experts please advise.</p>  <p>There are 2 intranet applications. Once application needs data from other application. So I have 2 options. Either provide the data using a stored procedure(SP) or provide using web service(WS). With the WS approach, the providing application has to be running for the consumer to use it. With the SP approach the consumer application can directly invoke the stored procedure with the caring if the other application is running or not.</p>  <p>Which option is beneficial?</p>
