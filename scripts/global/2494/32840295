<p>I have created a stored procedure to create a XML file. But when I run this stored procedure I see the result only in the MS SQL Server Management Studio. But I want that when I run the stored procedure, automatically a XML file will be created.</p>  <p>Someone any ideas?</p>  <p>This is the Stored Procedure:</p>  <pre><code>USE [NICK_OWNER] GO /****** Object:  StoredProcedure [dbo].[procWO]    Script Date: 09/29/2015 09:30:31 ******/ SET ANSI_NULLS ON GO SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON GO ALTER PROCEDURE [dbo].[procWO] AS BEGIN     SELECT      WO.WOID AS '@WOID',      WO.WONumber AS '@WONumber'     FROM      WO     WHERE WO.WOID = 2      FOR XML PATH('WO'), ROOT('ALLWO')        --Here should be some code to save it to a XML file END </code></pre>
