<p>I know this was asked many times, I've read them.  I've checked the [Enable SQL Server debugging] in all my projects in the solution.</p>  <p>My projects:</p>  <ul> <li>ASP.NET web app</li> <li>DAL class library. (The DAL uses a legacy .dbml to generate SP calling wrapper code.) No OR mapper neither direct ADO.NET used in the project.</li> <li>SQL Server 11.0.3153</li> </ul>  <p>I would like to debug my called SPs when debugging the C# code in VS. Ideally it should step in to the SP, but if this is not supported, then break in the SP on a set breakpoint. </p>  <p>Unfortunatelly it does neither. If I set a breakpoint in the SP, it is not a filled red circle, instead an unfilled, which is not a good sign. (I am setting this breakpoint in Server Explorer, by opening a data connection, and opening the SP in the VS editor.</p>  <p>What am I missing?</p>
