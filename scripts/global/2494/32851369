<p>I'm trying to made a stored procdure, to add 1 to an assignments downloads and subtract 1 from a Users credit.</p>  <p>My best guess:</p>  <pre><code>CREATE DEFINER=`Library`@`localhost` PROCEDURE `download`(         IN p_assignmentId INT(11),         IN p_userId INT(11)     ) BEGIN     DECLARE p_credit INT unsigned DEFAULT 1;     DECLARE p_downloads INT unsigned DEFAULT 1;  SELECT credit INTO p_credit  FROM Users WHERE userId = p_userId;  SELECT downloads INTO p_downloads FROM Assignments WHERE assignmentId = p_assignmentId;       UPDATE Users     SET credit = p_credit - 1      WHERE userId = p_userId;      UPDATE Assignments     SET downloads = p_downloads +1     WHERE assignmentId = p_assignmentId;   END </code></pre>  <p>Its complaining about my declare statements needing a semicolon, which does not seem to be the case, so any guesses?</p>
