Data is in memory in node.js console application and MySQL is on different vm.</p>  <p>I have sproc which can take single record at a time but how to implement bulk inserts. I checked some links where I found csv upload but I don't think so It can be done in my case.</p>  <p>Please help me solve this issue. Thanks in advance. Below is my code.</p>  <pre><code>BEGIN DECLARE EXIT HANDLER FOR SQLEXCEPTION, SQLWARNING BEGIN     set result = 0;    ROLLBACK; END;  START TRANSACTION;  insert into t1 (title, description, link) VALUES (title,description,link); insert into t2 (article, feed) values(LAST_INSERT_ID(),feedid);  COMMIT; set result = 1;     END </code></pre>
