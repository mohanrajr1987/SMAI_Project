<p>I am trying to output the results of a SQL select statement into an e-mail, preferably text. I am using PL/SQL. I already have an e-mail function where I can specify a message body. However, I am not sure the best way to get the SQL select statement results into the message body for an arbitrary number of rows.</p>  <p>As an example, I might want to do <code>select name, data from my_table;</code> and then be able to store this into a VARCHAR2 variable which I can include in an e-mail.</p>
