<p>Sorry if there is a repeat out there. I did try to find a solution but could not. </p>  <p>I am creating a stored procedure however it does not return any data. Why?</p>  <pre><code>DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS carInfo;  DELIMITER//  CREATE PRODECURE carInfo (IN carId INT)  BEGIN  SELECT  make.name AS 'make', model.name AS 'model', engine.displacement AS 'displacement', engine.aspiration AS 'aspiration', gearbox.value AS 'transmition', c.mileage AS 'mileage', ROUND(     SUM((model.rrp + engine.cost)      * (SELECT rate FROM age_depreciation WHERE year = c.age)      - (c.mileage * (SELECT rate FROM mileage_depreciation))))  AS 'estValue' FROM car_instance AS c LEFT JOIN model ON c.model_id = model.id LEFT JOIN engine ON c.engine_id = engine.id LEFT JOIN gearbox ON c.gearbox_id = gearbox.id LEFT JOIN colour ON c.colour_id = colour.id LEFT JOIN `condition` ON c.condition_id = `condition`.id LEFT JOIN make ON model.make_id = make.id WHERE c.id = carId;  END//  DELIMITER; </code></pre>  <p>I get no return data as in, not even a row with 0 columns and 0 rows. Literally, a white page.</p>  <p>I am calling the procedure by using:</p>  <pre><code>call carInfo(2); </code></pre>  <p>Normal output of this SQL looks like:</p>  <pre><code>+-------+-------+--------------+------------+-------------+---------+----------+ | make  | model | displacement | aspiration | transmition | mileage | estValue | +-------+-------+--------------+------------+-------------+---------+----------+ | hyrac | Oasis | 2.2          | normal     | manual      |   25000 |     4253 | +-------+-------+--------------+------------+-------------+---------+----------+ </code></pre>
