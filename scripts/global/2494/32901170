<p>I'm writing a program that accept a parameter from a user to a stored procedure in Java but inside the stored procedure in MS SQL server I have select statements that i would like to be displayed back to the user. How can I flag or display these values: java code:</p>  <pre><code>  public void outbound(String Eng_num, Connection con)    {       try       {           CallableStatement cs =  con.prepareCall("{Call outbound(?)}");          cs.setString(1, Eng_num);          System.out.println(cs.execute());        }// end of try        catch(Exception e)       {         e.printStackTrace();         }//end of catch     }//end of out bound </code></pre>  <p>MS Sql code:</p>  <pre><code>ALTER procedure outbound (    @eng  VARCHAR(25) )  AS BEGIN      DECLARE @ENG2 VARCHAR(25)      DECLARE @ENG3 VARCHAR(25)       SELECT @ENG2= Engine_num from Vehicle_retuns where Engine_num=@eng and Status=1      select @ENG3=Engine_num from Vehicle where Engine_num=@eng and Status=1       IF (@eng=@ENG3)        BEGIN            UPDATE Vehicle SET Description_of_Vehicle='Vehicle have been sent back to the manufactory',Status=0 where Engine_num=@ENG3            SELECT'Vehicle have been sent back to the manufacture'          END       ELSE  IF(@eng=@ENG2)        BEGIN            UPDATE Vehicle_retuns SET purpose ='Vehicle have been sent back to the manufactory',Status=0 where Engine_num=@ENG2                SELECT'Vehicle have been sent back to the manufacture'         END      ELSE        BEGIN            SELECT'THIS ENGINE NUMBER IS EITHER NOT IN THE DATABASE OR INCORRECT'         END  END </code></pre>
