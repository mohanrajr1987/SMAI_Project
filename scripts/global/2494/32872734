<p>I Have a need to pass a comma delimited string as a parameter to a stored procedure. That string contains ints seperated by commas. Then I need to use the ints in an IN clause, like, "where ReferenceValue in  ( '50022056', '50022073', '50022075', '50022072', '50022086', '50022095', '50022074', '50022077', '50022100', '50022101', '50022106', '50022107', '50022108', '50022109', '50022110', '50022111', '50022112', '50022113', '50022115', '50022116', '50022117', '50022118', '50022119' )"</p>  <p>Now I have a parameter I am passing to a stored proc containing <code>string parameter ="50001362,50001414,50001437,50001630,50001643,50001659,50001775,50001272,50001276,50001220,500012226"</code></p>  <p>I have tried using Dynamic SQL and doing  where ReferenceValue in  ( '+@groupNumbers+' ) however, i get back no results</p>  <p>At the top of my stored proc i am declaring the variable</p>  <pre><code>DECLARE @groupNumbers VarChar(1000) SET @groupNumbers = '50008300,50002427' </code></pre>  <p>The SET is just a test case to see how I can get back results with a comma delimited string. I need to pass in my string of group numbers into this parameter and get back results. Currently i Am looping through each group number and calling the query with each group number.</p>  <p>Any advice on what i am doing wrong? I am very novice at SQL.</p>  <p>Thank you</p>
