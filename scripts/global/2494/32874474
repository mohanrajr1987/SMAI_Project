<p>So I want the user to input whatever database they want to check and whatever tables they want to check. For example the call would look like this: call tableCheck('MyDatabase','table1 table20 table3'). So the procedure would check for those tables(space delimited). I have my code down below but I am having problem checking the other tables, it reads the first but not the second or third one. SO my code is not looping or not reading the next word.</p>  <pre><code>PROCEDURE `storeProc`(db VARCHAR(256), db_tables VARCHAR(256)) BEGIN    DECLARE tbl, tbls VARCHAR(256);  DECLARE c INT DEFAULT 0;  SET tbls = db_tables;      WHILE c = 0 DO          #split word         SET tbl = SUBSTRING_INDEX(tbls," ",1);         #go to next string         SET tbls = SUBSTR(tbls,LENGTH(tbl)+1);          #check every table         SELECT table_name AS 'Table Name'         FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES           WHERE table_schema=db AND table_name=tbl;          IF tbls = 0 THEN              SET c = 1;         END IF;     END WHILE; END </code></pre>
