<p>I have a stored procedure that does some inserts into a table. If I have to execute that same stored procedure repeatedly, each of these executions reflect the Inserts in the table after it ends or it could happen that each insert occurs after the end of the stored procedure execution and overlaps with the execution of the second instance of that stored procedure.</p>  <p>I hope I was clear, if not please correct me</p>  <p>Thanks </p>
