<p>The DBAs wrote the proc with a print statement.  Other parts of the code can use this no problem.  But now we are encouraged to use entity queries against the database.</p>  <p>The only return on the proc is an int of how many rows were changed.  In the store procedure is a Print statement of the results.  Is it possible to use entity in a way to grab that print statement as the proc executes?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
