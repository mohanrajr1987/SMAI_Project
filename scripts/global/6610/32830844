<p>I have a project written in perl-dancer and angular. Im using google as a openId system.</p>  <p>Some of my pages have an edit grid with a save button. In order to avoid loosing unsaved data on session(session created from perl-dancer) expire, I have an angular interceptor which listens to 401 server errors and opens an angular modal holding the "google login" button(this is triggered on server request after session expire).</p>  <p>I have set the opening of google form on a new tab instead of redirect from original page in order to avoid loosing the possibly unsaved data.</p>  <p>On successful google authentication  the new tab redirects to the project homepage and the original stays with the open modal holding the "google login" button.</p>  <p>Ok now the new tab can be closed and on the original window the modal closed and the unsaved data is still there.</p>  <p>But this poor solution as result of not being allowed to embed the google login form or similar seems as a terrible solution from the user experience point of view.</p>  <p>Solutions, suggestions, help?!</p>
