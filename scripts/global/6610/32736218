<p>I am trying to save in PHP an image generated from a Flash app. But in one particular situation where the request is 1708651 bytes (1.7 Mb) the response is error 413 Request Entity Too Large.</p>  <p>Server settings:</p>  <ul> <li>post_max_size is 48M</li> <li>upload_max_filesize is 32M</li> <li>memory_limit is 64M</li> <li>max_execution_time is 120</li> </ul>  <p>The image is sent via jQuery post to a PHP page. I tried in htaccess to put LimitRequestBody 10240000 but no success.</p>
