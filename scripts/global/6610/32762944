<p>I am using express and need to get the information in the querystring of the page i'm loading in any request for static files, be it marked in the html like   or by ajax requests.</p>  <p>I'm loading the page like this: <a href="http://localhost:8080/?qstringValue=someValue" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8080/?qstringValue=someValue</a></p>  <p>when i receive requests in the server for static files like images or favico, from that page, is there a way to get what's in the query string of the url i'm loading?</p>  <p>i will have several pages running: <a href="http://localhost:8080" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8080</a> only diferentiated by the query string and i will need to know where the request for images is coming from based on the different query strings</p>  <p>The solution may be on the express server(node-http) or in the frontend.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
