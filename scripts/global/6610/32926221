<p>So i've been googling this for a while now and no solution seems to work for me.</p>  <p>Given that the url to the xml file (taken from valve api) is: playerSummariesXml</p>  <p>I tried ajax calls such as:</p>  <pre><code>var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest(); xhttp.onreadystatechange = function() {     if (xhttp.readyState == 4 &amp;&amp; xhttp.status == 200) {        alert(xhttp);     }     xhttp.open("GET", playerSummariesXml, true);     xhttp.send(); } </code></pre>  <p>Which returns the link to my website with a /0 appended to the end,  and</p>  <pre><code>  xmlDoc=new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLDOM"); </code></pre>  <p>which says activexObject not declared</p>  <p>And other things...  Is there one resolute way to pull an xml file with javascript from a given url and read/display it?</p>  <p>I'm getting really confused considering this is super easy to do with php and don't see why I can't find a similar thing with javascript.</p>
