<p>Here's my doubt: I have an Xpage that makes a cross-domain GET request... the URL is a notes agent in other domain that returns a XML code. I need to set Access-Control-Allow-Origin to allow it, and I found how to set it in the domino server configuration... can I set it dinamically too in this notes agent that generates the XML? How should I do it? after the first line <code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1" ?&gt;</code> I can insert it as a custom header? does it work? Thanks in advance for help on this issue</p>
