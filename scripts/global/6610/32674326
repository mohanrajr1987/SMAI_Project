<p>I'm looking to get data from the <a href="http://dev.markitondemand.com/" rel="nofollow">http://dev.markitondemand.com/</a> API. The API was designed to be used with AJAX calls, but for technical reasons I cannot include JQuery in my project. How do I get the info that <a href="http://dev.markitondemand.com/Api/v2/Quote/jsonp?symbol=AAPL&amp;callback=myFunction" rel="nofollow">this page</a> provides without making an AJAX call to the server? JSON and XML are both fine.</p>
