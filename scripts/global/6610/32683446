<p>I am attempting to change contents of a second page depending on changes in another page. Simply put i have an image display page - <strong>#1</strong> and an information display page - <strong>#2</strong>.</p>  <p><strong>Page #1</strong> displays an image depending on a get variable which i acquire with javascript function and another function sends it off to a php page with an <strong>XMLHTTPRequest</strong> and handles it.</p>  <p>Now my question is do I need to use a Database table to store the variable and then create another PHP script acting as a listener from the database and if the variable changes send it off to <strong>Page #2</strong> with the display information or is there a simpler way? </p>  <p>In simpler terms - The get variable is set to 1 <strong>-></strong> display picture 1 <strong>AND</strong> show information related to product 1 on <strong>PAGE #2</strong>. Then get variable set to 2, then 3 and so on...</p>  <p>Thank you!</p>
