<p>I'm using Media Player library because it supports HLS now I have a problem...I pass to my player the url and the server respose with 302 HTTP when the player does another call to server, it has the header: origin null. Why?</p>  <p>I expected the origin header to be set to my domain, after following the redirect.</p>  <p>Can anyone explain to me why the origin is set to null instead of to domain A?</p>  <p>How can I fix it? Can I set header side client? I read that the Origin header is added by the browser, and can not be controlled by the user. is It true? thanks!</p>
