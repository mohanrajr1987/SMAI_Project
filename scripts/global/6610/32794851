<p>I have a page that's served over HTTPS.  Now I need to make a XMLHttpRequest call to a HTTP resource.  As you would expect, this fails because the browsers will stop these calls in a mixed content situation.  The HTTP resource is a 3rd party and I can't convince them to make their service HTTPS.  </p>  <p>What are my options?  Are there any workarounds I might be able to use. </p>
