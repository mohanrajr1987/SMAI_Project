<p>I'm on web page <a href="http://example.com/?param=value1" rel="nofollow">http://example.com/?param=value1</a>, and when I click on a link (whose href is javascript:void(0)), the page content changes, but I end up with the same url on the url bar. I can see with the debugger that two http requests are sent (one is post, followed by a get).</p>  <p>What I don't understand is that the post request has a referer header that is <a href="http://example.com/entirelyDifferentPath/?variousParams" rel="nofollow">http://example.com/entirelyDifferentPath/?variousParams</a>.</p>  <p>How is that possible ? I thought that one couldn't change the referer in a xhr request ?</p>  <p>I am not the owner of the site so I don't feel confortable giving you the real url (maybe the owner doesn't want me to), but feel free to ask more details and I'll retrieve them for you.</p>
