<p>Here are the screenshots of two network calls to GitHub API. </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/7yHYb.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/7yHYb.png" alt="Preview Panel with grayed out background"></a></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Re81g.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Re81g.png" alt="Usual and expected Preview Panel"></a></p>  <p>Why is one grayed out and not the other? Is this because of the Link Header which is supposed to be used for pagination?</p>
