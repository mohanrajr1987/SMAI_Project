<p>I am trying to send through dropzone a specific -already known- position ID of an image file to the backend, which is going to be uploaded on the server. Although the <code>formData.append()</code> is being used, I see that nothing is appended.Instead just this "<code>FormData {}</code>" shows up.</p>  <pre><code>dropzoneObject.on("sending", function(file, xhr, formData){     var nameOfFile = $(file.previewElement).find(".dz-filename").text();     var positionOfFile = fpos;     //console.log("The file who's being sent is named: "+nameOfFile+" and its position id is: "+positionOfFile);     formData.append("fpos", fpos); }); </code></pre>  <p>I expect to see in example fpos=16; </p>
