<p>In a JavaScript web app I authorize with a server using XMLHttpRequest and setting the "Authorization" header via <code>setRequestHeader</code>.</p>  <p>That usually works fine. But sometimes I manage to somehow end up with the browser popping up an "authentication" dialog requesting me to input a username and password (this is caused by an 401 response of the server).</p>  <p>From this point on, I am unable to set the "Authorization" header via XHR. It will always be set to the value, created from the data I put into the popup from the browser.</p>  <p>I find this very strange. Is the "Authorization" header somehow restricted? Can I override it?</p>
