<p>I have an Azure-hosted API that accepts logging/tracing data from multiple customer applications for the purpose of identifying/aggregating issues before the customer raises them in a support call. The API writes logging data to Azure Table storage. This works great with powerbi.com etc. for regular proactive monitoring, however...</p>  <p>As a "2.0" enhancement, I want to set up mobile notifications when defined conditions are met (e.g. 2+ table records created with a "severity" attribute = 1 within the space of 60 minutes, maybe where "ProjectType" = Mine). I don't want to send notifications on each entry to the table but rather trigger a notification on aggregated entries within a rolling time frame.</p>  <p>Are there any Azures service that provides this without having to create a custom cron job querying table storage every few minutes/hour (and therefore increasing PAYG costs). And would necessitate moving away from Azure Table Storage to Azure SQL?</p>
