<p>I have implemented Parse in one of my android application for sending the push notification to user. The Push Notification was working fine last month but now the problem is that the parse is not showing the details regarding the push: total push sent, push opened, open rate % yet the push is being delivered to users.The graph for push open is also working fine but not details below the graph.</p>  <h2>Push open Graph</h2>  <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_2xbmgzcrhmQmtyU0gzUElWMGM/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_2xbmgzcrhmQmtyU0gzUElWMGM/view?usp=sharing</a></p>  <h2>Push Delivery Report</h2>  <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_2xbmgzcrhmSUFYa1dpUm5ZdjA/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_2xbmgzcrhmSUFYa1dpUm5ZdjA/view?usp=sharing</a></p>
