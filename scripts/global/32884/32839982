<p>Trying to handle notification on an hybrid application. The notification arrives on device (can see it in logs and on device when application closed) but there's no way to handle it by that code:</p>  <pre><code>WL.Client.Push.registerEventSourceCallback(     "myPush",     "PushAdapter",     "PushEventSource",     function (props, payload) {         console.log("received notification - in notifications.js")         alert("moo");     } ); console.log("registered event source"); </code></pre>  <p>When watching mfp plugin, seems like iOS part missing, how can i handle that notification anyway?</p>
