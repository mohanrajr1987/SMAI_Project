<p>I was looking at different forums and tutorials but did not find anything that cover what I want to do. At the moment my notifications are working fine but I am trying to give the options to the user to receive them or not.</p>  <p>My server is sending 3 kind of different notification, they are all messages:</p>  <ol> <li>You have a new message</li> <li>A new user just connected </li> <li>A user is very close to you</li> </ol>  <p>I have an option menu where I am giving the user the option to choose which notifications he wants to receive. He can select the combination he wants.</p>  <p>The problem I have is I do not know how to allow the app to display say the message 1 and 2, but not the 3, if that was the user choice. So far the solution I have is either showing 1, 2 and 3) or showing nothing. I have nothing in the middle.</p>  <p>Did anyone came across this and how did you solved it? PS: This is for apple push notifications</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
