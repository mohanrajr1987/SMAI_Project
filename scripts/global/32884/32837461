<p>i am trying to send a broadcast GCM notification to all our registered user (around 4M) in parallel using multiple PHP script. But as soon as i start second script in parallel, first script stops without throwing any error.</p>  <p>In each request i am sending messages to 1000 GCM ids in a single request. Each script is working perfectly fine if we execute them in order. It stops only when i execute in parallel.</p>  <p>As Google already removed any daily quota on sending push notification, i am sure its not a limiting issue. </p>
