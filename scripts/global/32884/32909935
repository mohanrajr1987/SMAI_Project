<p>I just want to understand how the push Notifications will be sent to users? I aware of Parse, Urban Airship to implement this functionality.</p>  <p>My Doubt is how the news apps or some other feed apps will send Push Notification? </p>  <p>Will some person who is responsible for the app sends notifications  every day by going to parse dash board or Urban airship dashboard edit and sends message? </p>  <p>will they schedule the messages in advance or will they use scheduler(Timers or Alarms) in apps like every day at particular time they should read the message from server and show notifications?</p>  <p>I want to develop an App where the user should get a message every day. I just want to know like how these Notifications work.</p>  <p>Appreciate your suggestions . Thank you. </p>
