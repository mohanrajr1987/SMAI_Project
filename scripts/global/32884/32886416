<p>we are using phonegap cordova , node-gcm for sending push notification . Actually our mobile application is not completed it have login screen , so upon login successfully we send device toke to server . So we want that when we send push notification it opens the browser and redirects to the link , it is possible ? </p>  <p>Node Code </p>  <pre><code>var gcm = require('node-gcm'); var message = new gcm.Message();  //API Server Key var sender = new gcm.Sender('ccxxxcdddd'); var registrationIds = [];  sender.send(message, registrationIds, 4, function (a,result) {      console.log("ok",a);     console.log("result",result);  }); </code></pre>  <p>So basically we wants to open the particular link in browser upon clicking of push notification . We receive push notifications in mobile but upon clicking it open the app </p>
