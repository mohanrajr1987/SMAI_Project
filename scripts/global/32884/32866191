<p>I'm having a weird problem with push notifications in an adobe air app for iOS and Android.</p>  <p>I'm using the Easy Push ANE from Milkman Games along with the One Signal service.</p>  <p>The problem is that notifications do arrive, but sometimes (randomly), it can take up to 15 minutes for the messages to arrive at the device after they are sent.</p>  <p>This is critical for my app (a taxi booking app), since i'm relying on the push notifications for the communication between the taxi app and the users app. So, for example, if a user requests a taxi, it can take up to 15 minutes for the taxi app to be notified.</p>  <p>Talked to One Signal support, and according to them everything is ok on their end, and if I look at the One Signal dashboard, the notifications are delivered almost instantly all the time.</p>  <p>What could be the reason of this delays? and what could i do to make things better? </p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
