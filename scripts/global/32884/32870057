<p>CloudKit stores any missed push notifications in it's "notification collection", which you are supposed to query every time you get a CloudKit push notification. </p>  <p>How does CloudKit know when to flush those notifications? Specifically with silent delta subscription notifications for custom zones, where a notification consists of change history.</p>  <p>I don't believe the "marking" of them as read is correct, as other devices may need to read these change notifications to update it's local cache.</p>  <p>So does it flush them, or does it keep them forever?</p>
