<p>All of the documentation for the Google Calendar v3 API "push" is for talking to a server; is it possible to get push notifications to a client application that <em>isn't</em> server-based?  </p>  <p>I am developing a desktop program that synchs with a Google Calendar, so per this Google documentation:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><strong>To use push notifications, you need to do three things:</strong></p>      <ol>   <li>Register the domain of your receiving URL.</li>   <li>Set up your receiving URL, or "Webhook" callback receiver.</li>   <li>Set up a notification channel for each resource endpoint you want to watch.</li>   </ol> </blockquote>  <p>...push notifications won't work, and I'm stuck with polling.</p>  <p>I was hoping I could work around this somehow - any ideas?</p>
