<p>I'm currently building an iOS App which uses Parse, where users receive questions during a sports game. Users login and then "Join Game" by pressing a join game button, this then should subscribe their device by using PFInstallation to a push notification channel (Installation class) which represents that particular match. However, this seems to be inconsistent and adds users sometimes instantly, sometimes after 20 seconds, and sometimes not at all. I've used the saveInBackgroundWithBlock:^(BOOL succeeded, NSError *error) to check if its been successful or not but sometimes it takes a long time to get a response. </p>  <p>Is there another way to check if an installation has been registered with a channel? or a way to reinforce a channel subscription?</p>
