<p>I wante to create some notifications to user. Ex : when a new comment, when someone ask question,... I know how to create notification, but i don't know how can i do for send a notification just one time. Example : notification is send to user because he has a new comment. He click on the notification for start application and watch the comment. But now,  how can i avoid that it receives twice the same notification ? It is recommended to store it in a database, in "notification" table or it exist a system for manage this ?</p>  <p>I'm sorry for the very bad English.</p>
