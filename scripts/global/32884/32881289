<p>Understand from Windows Dev Center that if we create a Reserve app name, we need to submit the app within 1 year period. The purpose we create Windows Dev ID is just for notification hub only, if said after 1 year and we still not submit the app (This is enterprise app and we use side loading for deployment. ), the reserve name will be release. So is there any impact to our app for notification? We still can perform WNS notification?</p>
