<p>i have using the code as explained in the pushwoosh site .</p>  <p>they ask for this in the activity life cycle :</p>  <pre><code>@Override public void onResume() {     super.onResume();      //Re-register receivers on resume     registerReceivers(); }  @Override public void onPause() {     super.onPause();      //Unregister receivers on pause     unregisterReceivers(); } </code></pre>  <p>something is very not clear to me and it is drive me crazy , this is a push service why do we need to unregister each time activity is paused ?</p>  <p>and why do we need so much code in my mainActivity instead of few lines in my application class ?</p>  <p>i didn't chose this library but i gut to understand what the logic of that...i don't remember in other push services so much code and need to unRegister .</p>  <p>home i asked my question right because i really want to understand .</p>  <p>this is the full code for main activity </p>  <p><a href="http://docs.pushwoosh.com/docs/native-android-sdk" rel="nofollow">http://docs.pushwoosh.com/docs/native-android-sdk</a></p>
