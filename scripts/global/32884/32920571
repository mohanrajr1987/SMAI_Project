<p>I have implemented Parse Push notifications using customBroadReceiver, am reading Parse push data, creating local notifications locally (Not Parse Push notification) and using PendingIntent with Notification API to perform actions. <strong>How can I update parse analytics saying that particular push message is opened. I don't have "com.parse.push.intent.OPEN Intent"</strong> as I am using Notification message but not Parse Push messsage.</p>
