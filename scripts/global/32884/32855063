<p>My app is crashing when I use the components <strong>TPushEvents</strong> and <strong>TParseProvider</strong>. </p>  <p>When I run debugging the project, I get this error: </p>  <pre><code>Project Project1.apk raised exception class Bus error (10). </code></pre>  <p>Did anyone know what causes this error and how to fix it?</p>  <p><strong>Note:</strong> On my iOS it's working perfect. The problem is only in Android. </p>  <p><strong>Note 2:</strong> My Android device is Moto G3 (Android 5.1.1). </p>  <p>Thanks</p>
