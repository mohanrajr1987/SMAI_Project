<p>I have several icons in the header that is used from a font and wrapped with </p>  <pre><code>&lt;li style="margin-top: 15px"&gt;     &lt;span class="myIcons" id="messages" style="font-size: 5px"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I want to use it to trigger bootstrap dropdown however in its documentation, it uses button and div and, I couldn't figure out how to trigger it when clicked on the font.</p>  <p>Should I try using jquery and try to trigger the dropdown to open on click on <code>#messages</code>?</p>
