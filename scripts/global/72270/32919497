<p>I am using 3 bootstrap panels with panel headings <code>col-md-4</code>, at the bottom of each panel I have box-shadow and the panels have a max height of 300px. The text inside the panels is longer than the panels themselves. I would like to use <code>overflow: scroll</code> for this but when I use <code>overflow: scroll</code> it "overwrites" the box-shadow (of which, I understand why). I have searched for this seemingly simple solution for a while and have come up with nothing.</p>  <p>I have excluded the box-shadow style and the other two panels to keep it clean underneath.</p>  <pre><code>    [Fiddle][1]         .sub-content-panel {         height: 400px;         border-radius: 5px;         position: relative;         color: black;         }          &lt;div class="col-md-4 text-border"&gt;         &lt;a href="gallery.php"&gt;             &lt;div class="panel panel-default sub-content-panel"&gt;                 &lt;div class="panel-heading sub-content-panel-heading"&gt;                     &lt;p&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-commenting-o"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;About us&lt;/p&gt;                 &lt;/div&gt;                 &lt;div class="panel-body"&gt;                     &lt;p&gt;with 35 years experience as a furniture designer and builder, and his son Curtis, with 15 years of remodeling experience, have combined their talents in Remodel. contributes his business skills, practiced sense of aesthetics, creative elements, and knowledge of wood.
