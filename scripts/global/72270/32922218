<p>I want to create three columns with a different height and width of the  mid-column. Take this pic <a href="http://www.stepstone.de/stellenanbieter/stellenausschreibung/stellenanzeigen-aufgeben/" rel="nofollow">three column bootstrap problem</a> as the basic idea behind it but ignore the outermost left side. With a large screen the three columns are side by side. With smaller screens the columns are above each other. I tried a lot of things because it isn't possible right away with bootstrap. Unfortunately I run out of ideas. I tried masonry CSS but in my case it always align at the top. It would be great if someone has an idea! And yes, I searched the web!!! Thank you! </p>
