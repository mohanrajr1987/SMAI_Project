<p>I am doing a PHP project where a number of complete projects are pulled from a database. Now, for example, there are 10 completed projects. Using bootstrap I get a number like 74 projects completed. What I want is that, when page is not scrolled to this div, it should be zero. Then, after scroll, it increases from zero to 74. Can someone guide me if there exists any plugin to do this.</p>
