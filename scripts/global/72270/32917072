<p>I would like to utilize the external <a href="https://github.com/ngzhian/multi-step-modal" rel="nofollow">multi modal</a> Github script in meteor to run with bootstrap modals taken from a meteor bootstrap package I have installed on my app. There is no meteor package for this. I'm using the $.getScript() jQuery function to get the source JS file. It is set up like such:</p>  <pre><code>Meteor.startup( function () {     $.getScript("https://cdn.rawgit.com/ngzhian/multi-step-modal/master/multi-step-modal.js"); }); </code></pre>  <p>Unfortunately when I include this, the file from the URL gets loaded but the modal functionality doesn't work. I believe that all the HTML is correct. Is there an alternative way to include third party libraries? Could the library possibly be broken?</p>
