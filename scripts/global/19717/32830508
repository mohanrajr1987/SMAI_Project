<p>I Googled this for half an hour and cant find the solution but I think this should be something really simple.</p>  <p>This is my code</p>  <pre><code>&lt;input name="order[name]" id="order[name]" type="text"&gt;  &lt;script&gt;     $(document).ready(function(){         $("#previewForm").click(function(){             var orderName = $("input[type=text][name='order[name]']").val();             $( "#contactCollected" ).text( orderName );         });     }); &lt;/script&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I want the user to preview the form that he just filled.</p>  <p>Replacing </p>  <pre><code>$( "#contactCollected" ).text( orderName ); </code></pre>  <p>with</p>  <pre><code>$( "#contactCollected" ).text( 'some text' ); </code></pre>  <p>works so I think it's the selector problem. I can provide more code if necessary.</p>  <p>EDIT: It appears this works as is, I'm not even sure where in the process I replaced one mistake with another one.</p>  <p>Thanks For all the folks in comments especialy @Barmar and @Jonathan.Brink .</p>  <p>I wouldn't delete the question because of the discussion on naming ID's in input elements but I'm not sure about the rules.</p>  <p>Thank you everyone for your time and I apologise once more for not trying out the jsfiddle right away.</p>
