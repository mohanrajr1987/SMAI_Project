<p>I have a certain value the am checking if I can find radio buttons having Id attributes values starting with my value :</p>  <pre><code>if($("input:radio[id^="+myValue+"]").length &gt; 0) {    // some logic } </code></pre>  <p>For a certain convention I have, myValue shall evaluate to <code>~STR_2</code>, hence leading to the following selection evaluation <code>"input:radio[id^=~STR_2]"</code>.</p>  <p>There are no radio buttons in my page starting with such id <code>~STR_2</code>, but the obtained selection contains all the radio buttons on page and the length is > than zero.</p>  <p>I know that the tilde <code>~</code> operator is used for finding a string that contains a certain value but it is used as <code>~=</code> and not <code>=~</code>.</p>  <p>I hope anyone can explain the how this happened and what does it mean to have <code>^=~</code> altogether in a seletor. </p>  <p><strong>Note:</strong> The issue was resolved when I used single quotes to wrap the value <code>$("input:radio[id^='"+myValue+"']")</code></p>
