<p>I'm having real trouble finding which selectors to use to show some divs on my page as my html structure is overly complicated (wordpress comments system).</p>  <p>Instead of pasting it all here I've created a much simplified version of the layout and created a couple of fiddles.</p>  <ol> <li>This is the full page with all div's displayed :</li> </ol>  <p><a href="https://jsfiddle.net/e25zvfyg/" rel="nofollow">https://jsfiddle.net/e25zvfyg/</a></p>  <ol start="2"> <li>This is how I want it to work. Basically the reply box and associated existing comments are hidden until "REPLY" is clicked and then the hidden divs slideDown. I've included my "non-working" JS in this fiddle. Hopefully somebody can show me where I'm going wrong?</li> </ol>  <p><a href="https://jsfiddle.net/yf3oagx7/" rel="nofollow">https://jsfiddle.net/yf3oagx7/</a></p>  <pre><code> (function ($) { $('.single-f3ed-reply').hide(); $('.f3ed-reply').hide(); $('a.this-reply').click(function () {     $('.single-f3ed-reply').hide();     $(this).parents().next('.single-f3ed-reply').slideDown('fast');     $(this).parents().next('.f3ed-reply').slideDown('fast');     return false; });  })(jQuery); </code></pre>  <p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
