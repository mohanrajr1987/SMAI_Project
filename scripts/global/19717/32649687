<p>The question to select a custom tag is asked many times.</p>  <p><code>&lt;div mytag="foo"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code> would be <code>$('[mytag]')</code> or <code>$('div[mytag]')</code>.</p>  <p>Now my question is about the fact that the above isn't valid HTML5. This however would be valid: <code>&lt;div data-mytag="foo"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>.</p>  <p>Now my assumption was that -if I offer the user to use <code>mytag="foo"</code> <em>or</em> <code>data-mytag="foo"</code>- I could do this: <code>$('[$mytag]')</code>. Where $ = everything that is prefixed mytag.</p>  <p>Why is this wrong and how could I resolve this?</p>  <p>PS:<br> Currently I'm doing: <code>$('[mytag], [data-mytag]')</code> which looks <em>design-flawish</em>...</p>
