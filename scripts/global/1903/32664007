<p>My system has two related tables called <strong>material</strong> and <strong>items_budget</strong>. The second table has a form that lists the name of each <strong>material</strong> as a <code>checkbox</code>, followed by two more <code>input</code>, one for its quantity and the other one for its price. Here's the code:</p>  <pre><code>{% for material in materials %}     &lt;div class="checkbox"&gt;         &lt;label&gt;             &lt;input class="itemsbudget_material" type="checkbox" name="cdg_itemsbudget_type[material][]" value="{{ material.id }}"&gt; {{ material.name }} -          &lt;/label&gt;         &lt;input class="itemsbudget_quantity" type="text" name="cdg_itemsbudget_type[quantity][]" placeholder="Qtd" size="5"/&gt;x - R$         &lt;input class="itemsbudget_price_hidden" type="hidden" value="{{ material.price }}"/&gt;         &lt;input class="itemsbudget_price" type="text" name="cdg_itemsbudget_type[price][]" value="0" size="5" readonly/&gt;     &lt;/div&gt; {% endfor %} </code></pre>  <p>There is a trigger that is triggered when new data is inserted into <strong>items_budget</strong>, which function is to subtract from the current quantity of the selected <strong>material</strong> the quantity specified in the form.</p>  <p>The problems is that the trigger's function only works correctly with the first register in the <strong>material</strong> table, with the rest, the quantity field always returns NULL. According to the code above, I tried to proceed by putting brackets at the end of the <code>name</code> attribute, but doing this way the form page is only refreshed and no data is inserted into <strong>items_budget</strong>. Is there another way to list entities in Symfony2? Thank you!</p>
