<p>I was looking over some code that I created awhile ago, and noticed something odd.</p>  <p>I am creating a Persistence Unit programmatically due to needed user input as to the location of the Database to read.</p>  <p>My code is as follows</p>  <pre><code> Map properties = new HashMap();                db = plan.db;               // Configure the internal EclipseLink connection pool             properties.put(TRANSACTION_TYPE, PersistenceUnitTransactionType.RESOURCE_LOCAL.name());             properties.put(JDBC_DRIVER, "net.ucanaccess.jdbc.UcanaccessDriver");             properties.put(JDBC_URL, "jdbc:ucanaccess://" + db + ";singleconnection=‌​true;memory=true");             properties.put(JDBC_USER, "");             properties.put(JDBC_PASSWORD, "");           //  properties.put( "provider" , "org.eclipse.persistence.jpa.PersistenceProvider");             EntityManagerFactory emf2;             EntityManager em2;              emf2 = Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("PU", properties);             em2 = emf2.createEntityManager();     </code></pre>  <p>With this I was able to create my connections multiple times.</p>  <p>The problem I noticed is that I also had code in my "Persistence.xml"</p>  <pre><code> &lt;persistence-unit name="PU" transaction-type="RESOURCE_LOCAL"&gt; &lt;provider&gt;org.eclipse.persistence.jpa.PersistenceProvider&lt;/provider&gt; &lt;class&gt;db.Items&lt;/class&gt; &lt;exclude-unlisted-classes&gt;false&lt;/exclude-unlisted-classes&gt; &lt;properties&gt;   &lt;property name="javax.persistence.jdbc.url" value=""/&gt;   &lt;property name="javax.persistence.jdbc.user" value=""/&gt;   &lt;property name="javax.persistence.jdbc.driver" value="net.ucanaccess.jdbc.UcanaccessDriver"/&gt;   &lt;property name="javax.persistence.jdbc.password" value=""/&gt; &lt;/properties&gt; </code></pre>  <p></p>  <p>Now I noticed that I cannot find any way to add an "Entity Class" to this "Persistence Unit," however I was able to run my code fine, just like this.</p>  <p>I'm curious if it just overwrites the old properies and such from the Persistence Unit of the same name?  It still uses the Persistence Class of "db.Items."</p>  <p>I just want to make sure that this is the correct way to do it. </p>  <p>I'm doing changes to my code, so I cannot run it currently to see if I delete everything in my PErsistence.xml what will happen, but I'm curious about this.</p>  <p>I also noticed that the "provider" property was commented out.  Do I need that posted?  (It's included in the xml file).</p>  <p>there is also an example I saw that mentioned about "Server target" being set to "no" or something?  Any comments on that?</p>  <p>Thanks all</p>
