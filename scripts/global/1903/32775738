<p>I'm trying to see if the username variable in the post function matches the username in the accountsArchive entity. </p>  <p>I think the problem is that user.username isn't the proper way to reference the username entity. Also, the query above may have a problem. What's the proper way to see if the two usernames match?</p>  <h1>Python</h1>  <pre><code>class accountsArchive(db.Model):      # The username entity     username = db.StringProperty(required = True)     password = db.TextProperty(required = True)     email = db.StringProperty(required = True)     dateJoined = db.DateTimeProperty(auto_now_add = True)  class loginPage(Handler):       def post(self):          # The username variable         username = self.request.get("username")         password = self.request.get("password")          # The query         user = db.GqlQuery("SELECT * FROM accountsArchive WHERE                                   user.username = :name", name=username)          # This is how I tried to check if the two usernames matched         if username == user.username:              # Do stuff </code></pre>
