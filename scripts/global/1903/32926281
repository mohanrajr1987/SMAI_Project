<p>I have a relatively simple relationship that I can't quite figure out and was hoping someone could guide me in the right direction.</p>  <p>The tables my project uses are: ApplicationUser, Chemicals, OPC and Selected Chemicals.</p>  <p>Right now, I am using entity to easily create OPCs that are associated to the logged in user.  I would now like to create a sub list of selected chemicals that are attached to each of these OPCs using Foreign keys relating to an OPC and a Chemical.</p>  <p>Does anyone have any code examples of a project setup with a similar data structure or recommended reading that can point me in the right direction?</p>
