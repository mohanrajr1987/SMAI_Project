<p>I have a <strong>material</strong> table that is related to <strong>items_budget</strong>. The form for <strong>items_budget</strong> needs to list all the registered <strong>material</strong> as a <code>checkbox</code> group, and beside each <code>checkbox</code>, two <code>input</code> fields, for quantity and price. Below is the code block I wrote for rendering this piece:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;strong&gt;Materiais&lt;/strong&gt; {% for material in materials %}     &lt;div class="checkbox"&gt;         &lt;label&gt;             &lt;input type="checkbox" class="itemsbudget_material" name="cdg_itemsbudget_type[material]" value="{{ material.id }}"&gt; {{ material.name }} -          &lt;/label&gt;         &lt;input type="hidden" class="itemsbudget_price_hidden" value="{{ material.price }}"/&gt;         &lt;input type="text" class="itemsbudget_quantity" name="cdg_itemsbudget_type[quantity]" placeholder="Qtd" size="3"/&gt;x - R$         &lt;input type="text" class="itemsbudget_price" name="cdg_itemsbudget_type[price]" value="0" size="3" readonly/&gt;     &lt;/div&gt; {% endfor %} </code></pre>  <p>The problem I am facing can be seen in the image. Looking at the top-left image, you see I have marked "Material C", filled the quantity, and after submitting the form, as shown in the second image, everything is fine.</p>  <p>But if I do the same with another Material, as it can be seen in the last image of my table, the quantity field is NULL.</p>  <p>What happens here is that only the <strong>first</strong> register in the <strong>material</strong> form is, let's say, "seen". When I say "first register" I mean the lowest <em>id</em> in the <strong>material</strong> form, literally the FIRST. If I had deleted the "Material C", then "Material D" would be the first and the quantity field would be seen for it only.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/PHytu.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/PHytu.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I have tried to put at the end of each <code>name</code> attribute a pair of brackets, but by doing it the page is refreshed and nothing is persisted, nothing happens.</p>  <p>I have tried many different ways to render this. Also, I have tried to create my <code>material</code> field as a collection, but I really think this is not the solution because I must get the <em>id</em>, <em>quantity</em> and <em>price</em> entered in the fields. I would need to be able to render something exactly like this with a collection form.</p>  <p>Please I need guidance. If you need any more code I will be happy to update my question. Thank you.</p>
