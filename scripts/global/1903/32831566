<p>I'm actually having 3 entities: <strong>Bounty</strong>, <strong>Document</strong>, and <strong>Comment</strong>. When i first made the <strong>Comment</strong> entity, it was to serve the document <strong>Commentary</strong> purpose. Later i have added a newer entity called "<strong>Bounty</strong>", and i was expecting to use the same Comment entity that i was already using in the <strong>Document</strong> entity. </p>  <p>I wish to avoid having one <strong>DocumentComment</strong> entity, and another <strong>BountyComment</strong> entity.</p>  <p>Is having one <strong>Comment</strong> Entity is a good way to procede, or should i rather separate them in two different entities ? </p>  <p>If grouping entites is a good practice, how can i make them fit when there can be duplicate entry ?</p>
