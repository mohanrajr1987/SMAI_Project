<p>I seem to have a circular reference error in my EF code-first implementation. </p>  <p>I keep getting an error, when trying to save an entity:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>An error occurred while saving entities that do not expose foreign key   properties for their relationships. The EntityEntries property will   return null because a single entity cannot be identified as the source   of the exception. Handling of exceptions while saving can be made   easier by exposing foreign key properties in your entity types. See   the InnerException for details.<br>   ---><br>   System.Data.Entity.Core.UpdateException: Unable to determine a valid   ordering for dependent operations. Dependencies may exist due to   foreign key constraints, model requirements, or store-generated   values.</p> </blockquote>  <p>But I cannot find the circular reference (if there is any). </p>  <p>Is there any tool, that can help me with that?</p>  <p>Is it safe to assume, that the entity that I want to save has the problematic reference, or can that be anywhere in the model?</p>
