<p>I am new to ORM modelling and have a simple question.</p>  <p>Let's say I want a list of movies, their names, release dates and genres. A movie is here represented by the value type "name". But should I use "release date" and "genre" as entity types or a value types? I've seen different ORM models using different approaches. What is the reason for choosing one over the other?</p>
