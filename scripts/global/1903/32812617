<p>Consider the case of Order/Orderline, where Orderline is an VO collection, in this case persisting Orderline to DB require a separate table with its own set of rows, being an VO this can't have a id as per DDD, how can this mismatch be addressed, given ORM used for persistence. ( validity of the example is subjective but can't come up with a better over at this wee hour, excuse me for that )</p>
