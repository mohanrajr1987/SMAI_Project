<p>I have three tables such as A, B and C. There is ManyToMany relation from table A to table B. At the same time Table C stores the relations between table A and B. </p>  <p>I want a connection between the tables. For example i want to print a data in table A which relates with table B. It's ok but when i want to take it to the next level and print a data in table A which relates with table B and which relates in table C, it doesn't consider the second condition.</p>  <p>That's my problem.</p>  <p>For better understanding</p>  <p>A: Tv Shows B: Actors C: Roles</p>  <p>I want to display role of an actor who acts in a certain tv show. But it returns me all roles the actor has played before (Including other tv shows). But i want the result to turn me as just one role (just one tv show)</p>  <p>Tv Show (1st filter) > Actor (2nd filter) > Role (Result)</p>  <p>Problem: I can't apply 1st filter to results.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
