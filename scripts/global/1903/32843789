<p>I suppose the title says it all. I have to change a table so that the ID PK column is no longer auto generated, so I can physically insert specific values. </p>  <p>Now the table is actually a composite key. Which is as follows;</p>  <pre><code>    [Key,Column("driverId", Order=0)]     [DatabaseGenerated(DatabaseGeneratedOption.None)]     public override int ID { get; set; }      [Key,Column("type", Order=1)]     [ForeignKey("DriverType")]     public int DriverTypeId { get; set; }     public virtual DriverType DriverType { get; set; } </code></pre>  <p>Now I have added the DatabaseGenerated attribute and ran a migration which did create the following;</p>  <pre><code>        DropPrimaryKey("dbo.Driver");         AlterColumn("dbo.Driver", "driverId", c =&gt; c.Int(nullable: false));         AddPrimaryKey("dbo.Driver", new[] { "driverId", "type" }); </code></pre>  <p>i.e. the AlterColumn doesnt have the Identity bool in it. </p>  <p>However when I look at the make up of the table I have the following</p>  <pre><code>CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Driver] (     [driverId]             INT                IDENTITY (1, 1) NOT NULL, </code></pre>  <p>Am I safe to just removd the IDENTITY (1,1)?</p>
