<pre><code> public partial class User {     public int ID { get; set; }     public string Username { get; set; }     public string Password_Hash { get; set; }     public string Email { get; set; }     public Nullable&lt;System.DateTime&gt; Activation_Date { get; set; }     public Nullable&lt;System.DateTime&gt; Last_Active { get; set; }     public byte[] Membership { get; set; } } </code></pre>  <p>i have the above class ! each variable represents a table's column ( lets call the table "User"). I want to be able to create instances of the partial class User and then store them in a predefined database which contains the table "User". Also, i want to be able to read "User" row and store its data as a User class. So far i have created ADO.NET entity data model but i dont know how to store/read data from/to database !  thank you for your help </p>
