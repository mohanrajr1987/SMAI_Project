<p>Env:</p>  <pre><code>Java EE 7 JPA 2.1 EJB 3.1 Hibernate 4 </code></pre>  <p>Recently we are experiencing data problems in one of the table. Couple of points</p>  <ol> <li>The table is mapped to JPA entity</li> <li>Table as well as Entity does not have "version" column/attribute.</li> </ol>  <p>In other words, there is no optimistic locking available for this table. On doing RCA, it turned out to be concurrent data modification issues.</p>  <p>Questions : </p>  <ol> <li><p>In such cases where @Version is not available/used (in other words optimistic locking), is using a singleton repository class is the only option to make sure data consistency is maintained ?</p></li> <li><p>What about pessimistic locking in such cases ?</p></li> <li><p>I believe its a general use case where an application (especially legacy) can have some tables with version column and some dont. Are there any known patterns for handling tables/entities without version column ?</p></li> </ol>  <p>Thanks in advance, Rakesh</p>
