<p>I am stuck into a problem from hours which has occurred due to @ symbol in message while sending an email. Does anyone know how to resolve this, It may save mine a lot of time. following is my code </p>  <pre><code>$message .= '&lt;p&gt; '.$gift_card-&gt;field_from_name["und"][0]["value"].' has sent you a gift card &lt;/p&gt;'; </code></pre>  <p>where <code>$gift_card-&gt;field_from_name["und"][0]["value"]</code> returns email id ( which contains @ sign ) and when I remove this line from complete message it works properly</p>
