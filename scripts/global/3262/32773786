<p>I'm hoping someone can help me out with this because I have been stuck on this for days...</p>  <p>I have a bunch of webforms that each user needs to submit. I figured out how to show a view of the webforms the logged in user has submitted, but what I am stuck on is showing the webforms the user has NOT submitted in a view. So it would be a list of the webforms the user still needs to fill out.</p>  <p>There must be something small I am overlooking. I appreciate any ideas or help, thanks!</p>
