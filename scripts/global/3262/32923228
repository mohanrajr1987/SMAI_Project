<p>in order to manipulate a theme in drupal I had to install Drush in order to make sub-theme. I installed cygwin and followed the tutorial in the link <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/1432756" rel="nofollow">drush installer in cygwin</a></p>  <p>I am getting an error message in php which is as follow: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/4bDdm.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/4bDdm.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I Extensively searched google but failed to find a solution that worked. I even edited the drush.php file and hard-coded the link to bootstrap.inc but even that did not work. Help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
