<p>I am relatively new to Drupal. I have a drupal site on my staging but I would like to transfer the site to production server. My question is: Is doing drush archive-dump enough to do this? I tried doing this and it seems like the site is not loading the configurations correctly? I already executed the sql commands from the file generated by the dump.</p>
