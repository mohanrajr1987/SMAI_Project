<p>I am trying to improve upon the wordpress to drupal 8 migration module (<a href="https://github.com/amitgoyal/d8_migrate_wordpress" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/amitgoyal/d8_migrate_wordpress</a>) and add functionality to import taxonomy terms.  I have written the queries to join taxonomy terms to posts, but am having trouble assigning multiple terms to a field (called tags, which is an entity reference to taxonomy terms) of my drupal content type article. I have created a manifest file for mapping to my article content type:</p>  <pre><code>id: posts label: Wordpress Posts migration_groups:   - Wordpress source:   plugin: posts destination:   plugin: entity:node process:   nid: id   vid: id   type: type   langcode:     plugin: default_value     default_value: "und"   title: post_title   uid: post_author   status:     plugin: default_value     default_value: 1   body/value: post_content   body/format: normal   field_image/target_id: post_image   field_tags/target_id: terms </code></pre>  <p>In my posts.php file, which handles all the fetching and processing of wordpress data, I have a function (prepareTerms), which sets the property 'terms', which is used by the yaml file above. If I set this to a single value then the everything works as expected:</p>  <pre><code>$terms = '4'; $row-&gt;setSourceProperty('terms', $terms); </code></pre>  <p>However, I want to set this property as an array (for multiple taxonomy terms), like below:</p>  <pre><code>$results = $query-&gt;execute()-&gt;fetchAll();  $terms = array(); foreach($results as $term) {   $terms[] = $term['term_id']; } //$terms = Yaml::dump($terms); $row-&gt;setSourceProperty('terms', $terms); </code></pre>  <p>As each taxonomy term should be a number (term ID), I should be just passing it an array of integers, but I cannot seem to map this to 'field_tags'. I have tried using Yaml::dump before setting the 'terms' property in posts.php.  I have also tried the changing the yaml template to hardcode these, like below:</p>  <pre><code>field_tags/target_id: [1, 2]  field_tags/target_id: {0:1, 1:2}  field_tags: {target_id: 1, target_id:2} </code></pre>  <p>Linked is a screenshot of a dummy node I created where I have assigned two taxonomy terms (loaded through devel) - <a href="http://imgur.com/nkqQoNG" rel="nofollow">http://imgur.com/nkqQoNG</a></p>  <p>Any help stronger appreciated! </p>
