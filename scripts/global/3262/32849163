<p>I think the question is self-explanatory.</p>  <p>For example i need a content type named "person" with 2 fields (name, age).</p>  <p>I tried googling etc, but although there are many references on "drupal 7 add content type programmatically", I can find no references for Drupal 8.</p>  <p>I was able to create content types in Drupal 7, but it seems things have changed a little bit.</p>  <p>Any references (if not full code) are welcome.</p>
