<p>I am using Drupal 7 module 'Redirect' and i don't know which redirect to use when pointing on another website. Example: <strong>mysite.com/something</strong> links to <strong>mysite.com/something/download</strong> and i redirect that to <strong>othersite.com/download</strong>. It is very easy to setup but i really don't know which redirect is proper to use.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5UP6X.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5UP6X.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
