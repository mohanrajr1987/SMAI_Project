<p>I created a content type matches, and added two taxonomy fields - hometeam and awayteam. Both fields are saved in taxonomy vocabulary with name teams.</p>  <p>I want to make a view that show me awayteam related nodes. What i want is to get awayteam name from the current node and show nodes where hometeam or awayteam is like current node awayteam name. I watch a lot of tutorials, but i cannot make it right.  </p>
