<p>i have a question about writing a rule in the htaccess file which is located in the root directory of drupal. We use the Drupal 7 version. </p>  <p>We want to write a rule for the url that when i go to the page "/newpage/1/name" it should target the "/oldpage?id=1&amp;user=name". So the targetpage is a page which is created in drupal itself (a added content from a contenttype).</p>  <p>But i always get the same "Page not found"-Error. I can access the "/oldpage" by the way</p>  <p>I tried some rules about simply rewriteUrl without any parameters (to make a start). But it also didn't work for me. Here my try:</p>  <pre><code>RewriteRule ^oldpage /newpage [L,R=301] </code></pre>  <p>This line is below this part:</p>  <pre><code>  # Pass all requests not referring directly to files in the filesystem to   # index.php. Clean URLs are handled in drupal_environment_initialize().   RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f   RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d   RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !=/favicon.ico   RewriteRule ^ index.php [L] </code></pre>  <p>So are there any special rules for writing rules in the htaccess file in drupal? (maybe especially in version 7) or what is wrong on my code?</p>
