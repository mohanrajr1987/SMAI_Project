<p>I've copied over from the view's module's theme folder: views-exposed-form.tpl.php to themes/mytheme/views (also tried themes/mytheme) and renamed as views-exposed-filter--commerce_reports_products.tpl.php (and views-exposed-filter--commerce-reports-products.tpl.php).</p>  <p>After flushing cache and re-scanning the templates in the view, it still will not show. If I edit the original views-exposed-form.tpl.php it will show the changes.</p>  <p>I got the view name from the Theme's link in the view: views-view-field--commerce-reports-products.tpl.php</p>  <p>Does anyone know what else I might have to do, or why this is not working?</p>
