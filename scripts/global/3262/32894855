<p>I am trying to separate the UI layer for a legacy CMS app from Drupal. The immediate solution that comes to mind is to build a RESTful service layer on top of the Drupal architecture for the front end to consume. However, this is going to be a time consuming effort. So, I'm wondering if there's a smarter way to do it? I know we can define the JSON formats and write controllers to deliver it to the front end, but if we would like to avoid coding so much, what options would I have?</p>  <p>Are there any plugins I could use?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
