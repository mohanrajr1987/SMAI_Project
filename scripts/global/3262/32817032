<p>In Drupal 7, I use the module views aggregation plus.</p>  <p>There are 2 columns (A and B) which I apply a group aggregation of 'Average' and 'Sum' respectively. I want to have a 3rd column (C) which does a math expression (A - B) after the grouping. How can I achieve this? An example below</p>  <p>Before grouping</p>  <pre> ID | Column A | Column B | Column C 1  | 5        | 10       | -5 1  | 5        | 10       | -5  2  | 5        | 10       | -5 </pre>  <p>What I get currently</p>  <pre> ID | Column A | Column B | Column C   1  | 5        | 20       | -10 2  | 5        | 10       | -5 </pre>  <p>What I want to get</p>  <pre> ID | Column A | Column B | Column C   1  | 5        | 20       | -15 2  | 5        | 10       | -5 </pre>  <p>I tried retrieving the values of the summed field using devel module, and while I get this: $...['#views_contextual_links_info']['views_ui']['view']->style_plugin->rendered_fields[2]['expression_1']</p>  <p>I tried outputting that using Views PHP but it doesn't return back the correct value. I believe it is only returning back the value prior to being summed by the views aggregator plus.</p>
