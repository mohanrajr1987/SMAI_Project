<p>A question about Drupal 7's module xmlsitemap : </p>  <p>I've created a content type and set it to be excluded from the sitemap. After a while, I set it to be included in the sitemap.</p>  <p>So now all the new items of this content type are included in the sitemap, but I also have thousands of "old" items which are excluded from the sitemap.</p>  <p>How can I change all the existing (old) items of that content type, to be included in the current sitemap ?</p>  <p>I don't want to go over the "old" items one by one and change them to be included. Is there a way to do it ?</p>
