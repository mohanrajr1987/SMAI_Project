<p>I'm pretty new to Drupal, I've done some maintenance works on some websites, but nothing very complicated.</p>  <p>I'm developing now a website with Durpal 7 and I would like to get some advice about the structure of my content to get what I need.</p>  <p>Here is the structure of my Main-menu:</p>  <pre><code>|About us | - item_about 1 | - item_about 2 | - item_about 3 |Contact | - item_contact 1 | - item_contact 2 | - item_contact 3 </code></pre>  <p>In my main navigation, I have only the top level items of Main-menu (About us and Contact) without any drop down for sub items.</p>  <ol> <li><p>I would like to have a secondary menu (on the left) on About us page with sub items of About us. And I would like them to open inside About us page as a sub content, not in a new page. Do you see what I mean ? :) Can I do this only with my Main-menu structure or do I need to change my content structure ? I check the Node Hierarchy module, but I'm not sure to see exactly how I can use it to fit my needs.</p></li> <li><p>On the homepage, I would like to have three blocks with Contact's sub items content (and a Read more button). How can I "query" like my Main-menu structure to get Contact's sub item linked page content ? Once again, is it possible with my current structure or not ?</p></li> </ol>  <p>Thanks a lot for your help and advice ! :)</p>
