<p>I'm using Mac and latest MySQL. Recently I've updated OS to El Capitan and now realised that 'localhost' as a name does not work anymore, but only 127.0.0.1.</p>  <p>Is there some settings where I can define for mysql that localhost is actually 127.0.0.1?</p>  <p>Here is the message in Drupal (it's because I'm using localhost).</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/71biR.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/71biR.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>This settings in Drupal are using in order to connect to mysql database. If I use localhost it does not work, if I use there 127.0.0.1 - it works well.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/DeQ3S.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/DeQ3S.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
