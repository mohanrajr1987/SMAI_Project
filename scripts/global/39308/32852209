<p>I tried to find answer but couldn't find a discloser.</p>  <p>For the "Place Autocomplete Address Form" I just want to autocomplete the form NOT showing any maps at all - as google requires you to have an API key.. doest calling this api still count as usage (map loads)? Let say i will have at least 1.025.000 traffic per/day (no income) there if still have to pay around 5.000 per day - no way to afford this of course if you are no Enterprise...</p>  <p>Anyone now if just filling form is totally free with this traffic load?</p>  <p>Thank you so many much for taking a look.</p>
