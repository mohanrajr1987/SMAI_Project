<p>I am trying to read the public alerts available at <a href="http://www.google.org/publicalerts" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.org/publicalerts</a> which is part of google crisis response. But apparently there is no api for this purpose. I was wondering if anyone knows an easy way to get these alerts, such as an XML file. </p>  <p>I want to aggregate natural hazard warnings to show in my app and give notification to users based on their location. I found google's public alerts relevant, but I am open to other suggestions.</p>
