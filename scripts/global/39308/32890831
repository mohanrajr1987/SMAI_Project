<p>Suddenly I have some strange horizontal lines in Google Maps. Please see: <a href="http://hippo.ornl.gov/10secdownload/" rel="nofollow">http://hippo.ornl.gov/10secdownload/</a>. It was working fine and appeared about a couple of weeks ago. I drew those layers using kml files and I checked them in Google Earth and Google My Maps where they work fine. I can provide kml files if needed.</p>
