<p>I am labeling the vertices of latitude/longitude polylines.  I label them, as below.  They are the smallest I can find.  But they are only good to zoom level 13 and then they overlap, so I don't draw them for anything smaller.  But my client needs to see the grid labels while zoomed out further.  Is there a practical, alternate solution?   </p>  <pre><code>      lngLabels.push(new google.maps.Marker({             map:map,             position:latLng,             icon:{  url:"https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?"             +"chst=d_bubble_text_small&amp;chld=bb|"             + qtrLatLng             +"|FFFFFF|000000",                 anchor:new google.maps.Point(0,42)             }         })); </code></pre>
