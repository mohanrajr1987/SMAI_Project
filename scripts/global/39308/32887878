<p>I have a database which contains a list of point of interests with latitude and longitude information. This data is not from Google Places. I would like to get the information of the opening hours of the places based on their geolocation. Is it possible to do that using Google Places API ?</p>  <p>I have tried using <code>Google Maps Geocoding API</code> to get the <code>place_id</code> for given geocoding and then used <code>Google Places API Web Service</code> for getting the detail information of the place based on the <code>place_id</code>. However, it does not get the opening hours. I wonder how to get the detail of a place using geocoding ?</p>  <p>For example in <a href="https://www.google.co.kr/maps/place/Gyeongbokgung+Palace/@37.5795575,126.9771912,17z/data=!4m7!1m4!3m3!1s0x357ca2c74aeddea1:0x8b3046532cc715f6!2sGyeongbokgung+Palace!3b1!3m1!1s0x357ca2c74aeddea1:0x8b3046532cc715f6?hl=en" rel="nofollow">HERE</a> using autocomplete place search, it is able to return the detail information about the place. However when I right clicked on the marker and copied the geolocation using <code>what's this</code> and tried to use <code>Google Places API Web Service</code> to query the detail of the place, some information is missing, for example, opening hours of the place.</p>  <p>For example <code>Gyeongbokgung Palace</code> the latitude and longitude stored in database is <code>37.5802</code> and <code>126.977</code> respectively as shown in the picture, the location from Google Maps is different even though they are not that far from each other.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/I4bpD.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/I4bpD.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
