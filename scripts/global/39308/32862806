<p>I am using the Google Maps Directions Service to calculate the route between two points using <code>google.maps.DirectionsService();</code>.</p>  <p>The API returns an array <code>result</code> for the calculated route that contains an array called <code>routes</code> with a field called <code>legs</code> that has a field called <code>steps</code>.</p>  <p>A <em>step</em> is the most atomic unit of a direction's route and has an array called <code>path</code>, containing an array of <code>LatLng</code> objects describing the course of this step.</p>  <p>I use this array to get the longitude and latitude of every single point, but Google frequently changes the indexes of this array. For example, sometimes you get this:</p>  <pre><code>0: {H: 53.59823, L: 9.43753} </code></pre>  <p>And some time later you get this:</p>  <pre><code>0: {A: 53.59823, F: 9.43753} </code></pre>  <p>Where <code>H</code> changes to <code>A</code> and <code>L</code> to <code>F</code>.</p>  <p>Is there a way to avoid these random changes?</p>
