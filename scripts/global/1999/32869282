<p>I have a django/python based web application that I have been deploying to AWS for the past year. Now we need to get SSL setup so our users can sign up and make payments online. </p>  <p>I've integrated the Stripe checkout js and now I am trying to get a <strong>self signed</strong> SSL certificate, <strong>FOR TESTING</strong>, to run on my DEV AWS EB instance. </p>  <p>I went through the AWS documentation here  <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/SSL.SingleInstance.html#CreateSSLConfig.SingleInstance" rel="nofollow">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/SSL.SingleInstance.html#CreateSSLConfig.SingleInstance</a></p>  <p>AND, for the config file:</p>  <p><a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/SSLPython.SingleInstance.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/SSLPython.SingleInstance.html</a></p>  <p>Now when I deploy to my AWS instance, I am getting the following errors:</p>  <pre><code>2015-09-29 23:07:48 UTC-0400    ERROR   [Instance: *****] Command failed on instance. Return code: 1 Output: Error occurred during build: Command hooks failed . 2015-09-29 23:07:47 UTC-0400    ERROR   Script /opt/elasticbeanstalk/hooks/appdeploy/enact/01flip.py failed with returncode 1 </code></pre>  <p>I am not sure what is going on or how to go about debugging these errors. </p>  <p>Here is my config file:</p>  <hr>  <pre><code>  Resources:    sslSecurityGroupIngress:    Properties:      CidrIp: 0.0.0.0/0     FromPort: 443     GroupId:        Ref: AWSEBSecurityGroup     IpProtocol: tcp     ToPort: 443   Type: "AWS::EC2::SecurityGroupIngress"   files:    /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf:    content: |       LoadModule wsgi_module modules/mod_wsgi.so       WSGIPythonHome /opt/python/run/baselinenv       WSGISocketPrefix run/wsgi       WSGIRestrictEmbedded On       Listen 443       &lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;         ServerName myserver         Redirect permanent / https://myserver       &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;        &lt;VirtualHost *:443&gt;         ServerName myserver           SSLEngine on         SSLCertificateFile "/etc/pki/tls/certs/server.crt"         SSLCertificateKeyFile "/etc/pki/tls/certs/server.key"          Alias /static/ /opt/python/current/app/static/         &lt;Directory /opt/python/current/app/static&gt;         Order allow,deny         Allow from all         &lt;/Directory&gt;          WSGIScriptAlias / /opt/python/current/app/application.py          &lt;Directory /opt/python/current/app&gt;         Require all granted         &lt;/Directory&gt;          WSGIDaemonProcess wsgi-ssl processes=1 threads=15 display-name=%{GROUP} \           python-path=/opt/python/current/app:/opt/python/run/venv/lib/python2.7/site-packages user=wsgi group=wsgi \           home=/opt/python/current/app         WSGIProcessGroup wsgi-ssl       &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;   group: root   mode: "000755"   owner: root   /etc/pki/tls/certs/server.crt:    content: "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n\       ********=\n\       -----END CERTIFICATE-----\n\       \x20\n"   group: root   mode: "000400"   owner: root   /etc/pki/tls/certs/server.key:    content: |       -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----       *******       -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----   group: root   mode: "000400"   owner: root   packages:    yum:    mod24_ssl: [] </code></pre>  <p>I created my private key, certificate key and self signed certificate using OpenSSL when I SSH'ed into the EC2 instance under the ec2-user. In some cases, I've seen people have these files in <code>/var/www/html/.</code> I have the files in the home directory, would that cause a problem?</p>  <p>Any ideas of how to diagnose this or is there a better approach to setting up SSL on a single EB instance?</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
