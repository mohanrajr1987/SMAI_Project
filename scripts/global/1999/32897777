<p>I have built OpenSSL for iOS using <a href="https://github.com/x2on/OpenSSL-for-iPhone" rel="nofollow">this</a> github repository. Unfortunately built library is 44 MB in size. This is far to much.</p>  <p>I need to use OpenSSL only for Diffie-Hellman key exchange implementation. I think size of library will be significant reduced if I would extract only Diffie-Hellman part from it. Can anyone tell me if this is possible and how I can do it?</p>
