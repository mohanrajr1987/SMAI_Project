<p>I am Creating a ssl server using openssl. In that I am using SSL_CTX_set_verify() method to specify that I need to verify a requested client certificate . I read that if its last argument  (which is Verify_callback function pointer ) is passed as null , it picks up the default Verify_callback . I want to know how it verifies the client certificate?</p>  <p>I have already installed the CA certificate using <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/73287/how-do-i-install-a-root-certificate">http://askubuntu.com/questions/73287/how-do-i-install-a-root-certificate</a> and I see the certificate which client is passing is present at  /etc/ssl/certs location in server . If I manually specify this cert using SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations() in server , Client Cert validation passes . I don't want to hardcode any cert like this. So relying on the default locations it must be looking for the certs in server to verify.</p>  <p>How will this be possible? Is my understanding correct in this regard?</p>
