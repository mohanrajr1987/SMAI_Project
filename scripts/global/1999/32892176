<p>I am building an express app that will run on my local network. I just started using a self signed certificut and an https server instead of just an http server. Before I implemented https, I could go to my app with 192.168.1.66 (local ip). But after implementing https, I now have to type <a href="https://192.168.1.66:80" rel="nofollow">https://192.168.1.66:80</a>, otherwise my browser says "connection was reset" or something similar. </p>  <p>here is my server creation code:</p>  <pre><code>var port = process.env.PORT || 80;//is always 80 since I have not                                    //set process.end.PORT  var server = https.createServer(sslOptions, app).listen(port, function(){ console.log("listening on port 80"); }); </code></pre>  <p>Any ideas why?</p>
