<p>I am doing secure connection using SSL as const SSL_METHOD *ssl_meth = SSLv23_client_method(); Also I am disabling sslv3 as  SSL_CTX_set_options(ssl_ctx, SSL_OP_NO_SSLv3); But when i am calling ssl_connect errors are different on windows and linux  Windows error: GET_SERVER_HELLO:no cipher list Linux error: SSL23_GET_SERVER_HELLO:sslv3 alert handshake failure Why?</p>  <p>Also, i am doing failure testing, so  there are no shared ciphers between server and client but expecting same error on both platforms</p>
