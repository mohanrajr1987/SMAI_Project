<p>I know it's not secure (replay attacks), but for certain reasons, I want to un-randomize the challenge that is being used in the SPKAC in OpenSSL.</p>  <p>I've been looking in the source code (<a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node/tree/master/deps/openssl" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/nodejs/node/tree/master/deps/openssl</a>) for hours but I can't find the line where the challenge is being generated. I want to define the challenge (challenge = "some defined data").</p>  <p>Can anyone help me find this line? Thanks.</p>
