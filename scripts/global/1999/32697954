<p>I am receiving a certificate via <code>SSL_get_peer_certificate()</code> and can read information about that certificate via <code>X509_get_subject_name(cert)</code>. That's why I am pretty sure that from this side everything works right. I also updated my CA-Certificates and called <code>SSL_set_default_verify_paths(context)</code>. </p>  <p>I tried this with several websites (google.de, openssl.org, ...). I have really no idea why I don't get the return value 0 (=X509_V_OK).</p>  <p>I also tried <code>SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations()</code> including <code>c_rehash</code> the directory of the ca-certificates. That's why the CA-Certificates should be loaded correct into the SSL_CTX. Still Error Code 20 from <code>SSL_get_verify_result()</code></p>  <p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>  <p>If I try the same with the command line utilites of OpenSSL (<code>openssl s_client -showcerts -connect www.google.com:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs/</code> I get as a result return code 0 (ok). How can this be possible?</p>
