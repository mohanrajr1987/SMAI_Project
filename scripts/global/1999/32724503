<p>Does openssl have a "raw" (non-EVP) interface to do AES GCM encryption and decryption?  I'm looking for something comparable to AES_cbc_encrypt() or DES_ede3_cbc_encrypt(), but for AES GCM.  I found the openssl EVP interfaces for AES GCM but I can't find any information on any non-EVP interface.  </p>  <p>I understand the EVP interface has many advantages for general purpose use, but I'm doing some tests where a non-EVP interface would be easier to use.</p>
