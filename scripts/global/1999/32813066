<p>I need to implement TLS on an embedded device with an OpenSSL client running on a normal computer.  The data transfers are limited to less than 1 kB at a time.  I have been looking at mbedtls and it is possible to limit the record buffer to 2 kB to save memory, however the standard TLS record can be up to 16 kB.  Is it possible to limit the record size in TLS or at the very least require each SSL_write command to create its own record?  Otherwise OpenSSL may concatenate the data and create a record that is too long to be received. I have complete control over both ends of the connection so there shouldn't be any issues with compatibility. </p>
