<p>From a newbie:</p>  <p>Setup: 1) Created a s_client cert using openssl command and installed on a windows jboss app server - "openssl s_client -connect . Appears cert used TSv1/SSLv3. 2) User auths against AD currently fails because AD is requesting TLS1.0 </p>  <p>Error: An TLS 1.0 connection request was received from a remote client application but none of cipher suites supported by client application are supported by the server. The ssl connection has failed.</p>  <p>Question: How can I force openssl to use tls2/3 on the server? Any other suggestion? </p>
