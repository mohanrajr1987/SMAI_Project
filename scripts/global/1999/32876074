<p>On Hpsmh(hp system management homepage) i want to replace standard pem with my personal certificate,(we have a internal CA) I have three certificates,one is private key,another is the cert another one is CA cert. Works fine on applications like openldap and stunnel. For hpsmh i have tried first to convert to pcks7</p>  <pre><code>openssl crl2pkcs7 -outform PEM  -nocrl -certfile /etc/ssl/certs/hpux.crt  -out cert.pem openssl crl2pkcs7 -outform PEM  -nocrl -certfile /etc/ssl/certs/hpux.key  -out file.pem </code></pre>  <p>Then i copy to /opt/hpsmh/sslshare/cert.pem and /opt/hpsmh/sslshare/file.pem But on restart of smh give this error</p>  <pre><code>The server certificate did not match the private key and has been regenerated. The problematic certificate was renamed certmm.pem and is in the "..\hp\sslshare" subdirectory. </code></pre>  <p>Any suggestion? Thanks</p>
