<p>I am doing a project with encrypting video and I have a few questions for the procedure.</p>  <p>I used a command to transcode <code>mp4</code> to <code>HLS</code> with a <code>ts</code> segment duration of ~10 seconds.</p>  <p>First, I need to encrypt those videos with a key from database. However, I have no idea for the encryption whether working with ffmpeg or not.</p>  <p>Second, if the encryption can work without ffmpeg, so what should I do? I have searched in google which includes something like openssl / aes but there is no a detailed step for me to follow, even the ffmpeg link: <a href="http://www.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-all.html#srtp" rel="nofollow">http://www.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-all.html#srtp</a></p>  <p>Could anyone give me a hand, teaching me how to encrypt a video? Thanks to you.</p>
