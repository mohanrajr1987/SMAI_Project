<p>I want to configure wpa_supplicant to work with NPS server for policy PEAP/EAP-TLS. I chose this policy because I want both client and server to authenticate using certificates.</p>  <p>My "wpa_supplicant.conf" file has following entries for network block:</p>  <pre><code>network={ key=IEEE8021X eap=PEAP identity="msheeri" password="Password1" ca_cert="&lt;path to CA cert&gt;" ca_path="&lt;dir where trusted certs are&gt;" client_cert2="&lt;client cert signed by CA&gt;" phase1="peapver=0" eapol_flags=0 } </code></pre>  <p>At NPS server,I configured PEAP with 'Smartcard or Other certificate" as the authentication policy. However, I am not able to authenticate successfully. </p>  <p>NPS server shows log as Audit Error with the following info:</p>  <pre><code>Reason Code:            300 Reason:             No credentials are available in the security package </code></pre>  <p>Anyone got any idea what is wrong here ?</p>
