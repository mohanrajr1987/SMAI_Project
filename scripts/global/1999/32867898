<p>I want to know if there is a way to create .key file for (public and private key) using keytool , I understand that we can generate a keystore using below command</p>  <p><code>keytool -genkeypair -keysize 2048 -keyalg RSA -alias appalias -keystore D:\..\..</code></p>  <p>which has the keypair , I am also aware of java way of retrieving the keys from keystore , but is there a direct way for it using KEYTOOL </p>
