<p>I am trying to compile networking <code>dll</code> project in Visual Studio 2010. In past, the original authors used the project to produce standalone <code>dll</code> file that could be distributed with the server it was used for. If I open their <code>dll</code>, I cans see this in dependency walker (the red items are not really an issue, the dll works):</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/jM6I8.png" alt="image description"></p>  <p>Now I tried to compile the project, but for both 32bit and 64bit (and 64bit is what I'm supposed to get to work) I produce a library that requires OpenSSL installed:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/dTz2J.png" alt="image description"></p>  <p>Trying to put the <code>libeay32.lib</code> out of the build just causes link errors:</p>  <pre><code>1&gt;  Finished searching libraries 1&gt;TTClient.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol _BF_set_key 1&gt;TTProtocol.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol _BF_ecb_encrypt 1&gt;D:\techsys\WebSightR220lib\Release\WebSightR220lib.dll : fatal error LNK1120: 2 unresolved externals </code></pre>
