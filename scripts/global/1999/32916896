<p>There's an API I'm working with that returns data that's gunzipped and double Base64 encoded. I've tried using several of the Base64 libraries in NPM to no avail. Doing each library's equivalent <code>decodeBase64(decodeBase64(something))</code> always fails due to the output encoding being faulty.</p>  <p>This work in the shell: <code>something | openssl enc -base64 -d -A | openssl enc -base64 -d -A | gunzip</code>. I'm essentially looking for a Node.js approach that behaves exactly the same as <code>something | openssl enc -base64 -d -A | openssl enc -base64 -d -A | gunzip</code>. </p>  <p>The following libraries do not work in this situation: base64 base-64 js-base64</p>
