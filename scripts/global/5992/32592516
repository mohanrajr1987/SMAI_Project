<p>I am trying to launch multiple processes to parallelize certain tasks and want one global variable to be decremented by 1 each time each process executes a method X(). </p>  <p>I tried to look at the multiprocessing.Value method but not sure if that's the only way to do it. Could someone provide some code snippets to do this ?</p>  <pre><code>from multiprocessing import Pool, Process  def X(list):   global temp   print list   temp = 10   temp -= 1   return temp  list = ['a','b','c'] pool = Pool(processes=5) pool.map(X, list) </code></pre>  <p>With the use of global variable, each process gets its own copy of the global variable which doesn't solve the purpose of sharing it's value. I believe, the need is to have sort of a shared memory system but I am not sure how to do it. Thanks</p>
