<p>I'm developing an application that will need to provide certain state to users in real time. Every user will use an AJAX script to 'watch' that state - every user will see all of the shared state. I'm concerned about security, since some of the shared state are secretive data. </p>  <p>I've tried to implement this with environment variables in <code>.env</code>, but I need arrays and I think <code>.env</code> is not compatible with arrays.</p>  <p>I've also tried using globals without success. </p>  <p>My final attempt was to use a config file and the config helper from <code>laravel</code>, but changes to the state weren't saved! I have thought about using a database table, but I don't know how to make it safe.</p>  <p>How should I approach this problem?</p>
