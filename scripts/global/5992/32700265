<p>I have a working program which must be split into multiple parts, for edition purposes. In this program is needed to keep user login info in char arrays to be able to connect to SQL, and this connection info is used many times in parts of the program that will end up in separated .cpp files, which will compile in a single program.</p>  <p>The problem is that if they are declared in just one file, they will be missing in the rest, and if they are declared in all of them, there will be duplicated definitions.</p>  <p>So, to make a concrete and simple example, if I have the following code:</p>  <pre><code>#include &lt;mysql++/mysql++.h&gt; #include &lt;iostream&gt;  using namespace std; using namespace mysqlpp;  char server[]   =   "localhost"; char user[]     =   "root"; char pass[]     =   "xxxxxxx"; char db[]       =   "prog";  void function()     {     Connection con;     con.connect("", server, user, pass);     con.select_db(db);     //action1...;     }  void separated_function()     {     Connection con;     con.connect("", server, user, pass);     con.select_db(db);     //action2...;     }  int main( int argc, char *argv[] ) {     cout &lt;&lt; "INICIO\n";      function();     separated_function();     //something else with the mentioned variables...;      cout &lt;&lt; "FIN\n";     return 0; } </code></pre>  <p>How can it be split correctly, to have <code>function()</code>, <code>another_function()</code> and <code>main()</code> in separated .cpp files,and make <code>server</code>, <code>user</code>, <code>pass</code> and <code>db</code> avaliable to all of them.</p>  <p>I know there must be many ways, but any working one is good enough, since I'm not getting any results so far.</p>  <p>Thanks for any help.</p>  <p><strong>NOTE: This question is not about how to use the variables with MySQL, but how to split the program correctly.</strong></p>
