<p>I'm a newbie to OpenCL and I want to write my program in the most efficient way.</p>  <p>In my program I read an array of floats and produce an array of floats as the result. And my question is:</p>  <p>Is there any problem causing any inefficiencies by writing my calculated answer to the same buffer as I get my input? Such as:</p>  <pre><code>c[i] = c[i]*2; </code></pre>  <p>where c is a float array in the global memory.  Is there any performance improvement I can get by changing the above into:</p>  <pre><code> d[i] = c[i]*2; </code></pre>  <p>where both c and d are float arrays in the memory. </p>
