<p>I am using an Access 2010 database and I cannot figure out how to store multiple parameters for a function call in a single constant string. </p>  <p>For example, let's say I want to open a form with the following:</p>  <pre><code>DoCmd.OpenForm "someformname",acNormal,,"ID=50",acFormEdit, acWindowNormal,"OPENARGS" </code></pre>  <p>Can I store all that in a global constant such as </p>  <pre><code>Public Const C_FORMOPENEDIT as String </code></pre>  <p>and then open the form like this?</p>  <pre><code>DoCmd.OpenForm C_FORMOPENEDIT </code></pre>  <p>It does not seem to work in this way. How can I get VBA to recognize that this is a series of parameters separated by commas? Or is this not possible?</p>  <p>Note: I have attempted already to call it by the parameter name such as <code>FormName :=</code> and I have also already verified that any quotes in the string, where needed, are passed through. (like """)</p>
