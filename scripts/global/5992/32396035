<p>I have a doubt about which option would be a better one in order to have a more understandable code. I have a variable that will be used just inside one method but, as this variable is a configuration variable, I think that it would be nice that this would be a global one. So I have created it on the top of the class as: private final int VARIABLE = 5000;</p>  <p>But then, as this variable is used just once, the Android Studio launches a warning that says "Field can be converted to a local variable". Do you think that is better to keep this variable as a global one (in order to be more clear for the future) or it is better to set it as a local variable?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
