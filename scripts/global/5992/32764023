<p>I am compiling a C code using gcc ARM cross-compiler. I wonder if there is a gcc option instructing the compiler to allocate a global variable in the stack rather than the data section. I checked <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.1.2/gcc/Variable-Attributes.html" rel="nofollow" title="this link">this link</a> but it does not mention anything useful to resolve my issue. Any help is greatly appreciated. </p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
