<p>I have a complicated GUI with many contols and sub VIs. I pass the values of my controls to the sub VIs and when I need to change some property of the controls (i.e. disable them), I pass the references.</p>  <p>My Block Diagram is far too big. So I want to use global variables. Then I could display the sub VIs as icons and save a lot of space on the diagram (my sub VIs have a lot of inputs). </p>  <p>But what should I do about the controls whose properties I want to change (now I pass references to them instead of just values)? When I use a global variable, I can get only its value, nothing more.</p>  <p>I could create global references to all my controls and use them in my sub VIs, but then the sub VIs would be very unclear and I want to avoid it.</p>  <p>So how can I create a global control in Labview?</p>  <p>Edit: I have a control called "Motor ID" in my main VI. When I want to connect to the motor in a sub VI, I pass a reference to that control. In the sub VI I use the property "disabled" to disable the control if the connection was established.</p>  <p>When I use a global variable to hold the motor ID, all I will be able to do is to get the motor ID and connect with the motor. But I won't be able to disable the control in my main VI.</p>
