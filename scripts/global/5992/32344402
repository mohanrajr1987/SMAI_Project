<p>I would like to define my function <strong>f(x,a)</strong> in which the value of '<strong>a</strong>' changes, so that every time I call <strong>f(x,a)</strong>, the value of '<strong>a</strong>' will be different. So far the following code serve the purpose:</p>  <pre><code>a=0 def f(x):     global a     a=a+1     return a+x**2 </code></pre>  <p>In this case, everytime <strong>f(x)</strong> is called, the value of <strong>a</strong> is changed as well. I am wondering if there are any other ways to realize the results? Thank you.</p>
