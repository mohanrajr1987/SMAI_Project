<p>I am just wondering if there is a way to have a global variable within an object. I need all the methods of a certain object to be able to share a variable instead of having the same variable rewritten in each method. </p>  <p>example: This is what I am doing now..</p>  <pre><code>    var myObject = {           methodOne: function(){             var myVariable = 'stuff';             console.log(myVariable);           },          methodTwo: function(){             var myVariable = 'stuff';             console.log(myVariable);           }     } </code></pre>  <p>This is what I want to do....</p>  <pre><code>    var myObject = {           var myVariable = 'stuff';           methodOne: function(){             console.log(myVariable);           },          methodTwo: function(){             console.log(myVariable);           }     } </code></pre>  <p>I think I might have some syntax wrong, but I have tried it different ways and the methods will not run. Surprisingly I have not been able to find a direct answer to this topic on the internet.</p>
