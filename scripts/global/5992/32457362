<p>I want to define a global variable as a worksheet on opening a file, so I have used the following code:</p>  <p>In Module1:</p>  <pre><code>Public mySheet As Worksheet </code></pre>  <p>In ThisWorkbook:</p>  <pre><code>Sub Workbook_Open()       Set mySheet = Sheet1    End Sub </code></pre>  <p>I want to then use <code>mySheet</code> to refer to this particular worksheet throughout various procedures, some of which refer back to this worksheet having opened a new file.</p>  <p>It works initially - when I open the file the variable is set, and a macro involving <code>mySheet.Unprotect</code>, <code>mySheet.Protect</code>, and <code>mySheet.Range("A1")</code> works. However, when I try to run it again I get an error <code>Object variable or With block variable not set</code>, and the debug takes me to the <code>mySheet.Unprotect</code> line, which is the first time the sheet is referenced.</p>  <p>How can I define this worksheet in a global variable so that the definition sticks?</p>  <p>For reference, the particular macro I am referring to is below, although I have had a similar problem with different bits of code:</p>  <pre><code>Sub mySub()     mySheet.Unprotect      With Application.FileDialog(msoFileDialogOpen)           .AllowMultiSelect = False                    If .Show &lt;&gt; 0 Then             mySheet.Range("A1") = .SelectedItems(1)         End If                End With      mySheet.Protect         End Sub </code></pre>
