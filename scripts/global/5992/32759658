<p>I have a very big dataset and I analyze it with R.</p>  <p>The problem is that I want to add some columns with different treatments on my dataset AND I need some recursive function which use some global variable. Each function modify some global variable et create some variables. So the duplication of my dataset in memory is a big problem...</p>  <p>I read some documentation : if I didn't misunderstand, neither the use of &lt;&lt;- nor assign() could help me...</p>  <p>What I want :</p>  <pre><code>mydata &lt;- list(read.table(), ...) myfunction &lt;- function(var1, var2) {    #modification of global mydata    mydata = ...    #definition of another variable with the new mydata    var3 &lt;- ...    #recursive function    mydata = myfunction(var2, var3) } </code></pre>  <p>Do you have some suggestions for my problem ?</p>
