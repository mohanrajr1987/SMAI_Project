<p>Consider following program: (see live demo <a href="http://ideone.com/ptxbtS" rel="nofollow">here.</a>)</p>  <pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt; inline double fun() {     return 3.0; } extern double m; double d2=m; int main() {     std::cout&lt;&lt;d2; } double m=fun(); </code></pre>  <p>I was expecting to get output of program as 3.0 but it gives me output 0. Why?</p>  <p>It looks like variable d2 is initialized statically?</p>  <p>Shouldn't it be initialized dynamically? </p>  <p>I've tested it on g++ 4.8.1, 4.9.2 &amp; MSVS 2010 &amp; get 0 as an output.</p>  <p>Is it unspecified behavior (I think so)?  What C++ standard says about this?</p>
