<p>I am working on a D3 force layout where you can click a node at a time to highlight (i.e. change the color of) it and its links. If you click the same node again, it un-highlights if and if you click on a different node it un-highlights the first and then highlights the new node. I can think of two ways to do this and I would like to know which way is the best.</p>  <p>Option A: the way I am currently doing this by having a true/false "clicked" data element on each node that is updated every time you click unclick a node. </p>  <p>Option B: I believe I could also not have any status recorded on the node itself and instead have a "clickedNode" global variable for the node name that I update and compare things to.</p>  <p>Also, is there a way to create a two-way binding of either of those two options so that if you change it, it automatically changes the style/attr of the related node(s)?</p>
