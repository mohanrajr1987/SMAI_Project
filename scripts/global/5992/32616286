<p>In the answer to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1885251/how-do-i-tell-pylint-its-a-variable-not-a-constant-to-stop-message-c0103">how to stop Pylint message C0103</a>, @ChristopheD accurately mentioned that "pylint interprets all module-level variables as being 'constants'."</p>  <p>I like Pylint, and suppose that the authors have code-quality-encouraging reasons for its default behavior. So, can anyone tell me: <strong>why</strong> does pylint interpret all module-level variables as being 'constants'?</p>  <p>Is this perhaps pylint's way of highlighting implicit <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?GlobalVariablesAreBad" rel="nofollow">global variables, which are considered bad</a>?</p>
