<p>Python is my newest language (Python-2.6), my background is in C/C++. Normally, I would create a global variable and be able to modify and access it across all of my files. I am trying to achieve that same functionality in python.  </p>  <p>Based off of this post: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15959534/python-visibility-of-global-variables-in-imported-modules">Python - Visibility of global variables in imported modules</a> I see that "Globals in Python are global to a module, not across all modules". I have multiple variables that rely on user input, and must be accessed and modified by four different modules and in the main code, which is why I am trying to use global(ish) variables in Python. </p>  <p>I have two attemps to make this work: </p>  <p>1) If I stick the code with the modifiable global variables in my main code, I run into the issue of "Executing the Main Module Twice" as detailed here: <a href="http://python-notes.curiousefficiency.org/en/latest/python_concepts/import_traps.html" rel="nofollow">http://python-notes.curiousefficiency.org/en/latest/python_concepts/import_traps.html</a> The program works, other than being executed twice.</p>  <p>2) If I create a separate module and put the variables into a function, I find that I have undefined variables in my other modules and my code will error out. From steping through the code, I see that when the variables are accessible/modifiable by moduleA, but then everything breaks when moduleB and moduleC try to use them, because the modifications did not stay. </p>  <p>How do I utilize Python to suit my needs? I believe my problem lies with attempting to use global variables and importing the global variables </p>
