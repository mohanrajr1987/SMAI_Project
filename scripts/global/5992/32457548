<p>I want to store my HTTP paths in a proper way within android studio so they would not be depended on the environment (debug, compile, etc..) and not duplicated all round the project. </p>  <p>Would this be satisfied method, assigned in a separated class?</p>  <pre><code>public class pathClass{     public static final string HTTP_HOST    = "......."     public static final string HTTP_URL     = "......."     public static final string HTTP_METHOD  = "......."     .     .     . } </code></pre>
