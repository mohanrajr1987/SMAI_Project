<p>A user of StackOverflow published this code long ago, I tried to run it but it marks this error: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28782325/python-adaptfilt-2-0-floatingpointerror-invalid-value-encountered-in-multiply">original post</a></p>  <p>while u! = "": NameError name 'u' is not defined</p>  <p>I understand that the 'u' is not defined but did not understand how to operate the user who posted  </p>  <pre><code>import numpy as np import adaptfilt as adf import pyaudio import wave  np.seterr(all='raise') p = pyaudio.PyAudio() stream = p.open(format = p.get_format_from_width(2),                     channels = 1,                     rate = 44100,                     input = True,                     output = True,                     #stream_callback = self.callback                     )  wf = wave.open("prova.wav", 'rb') while u != " ": data = wf.readframes(1024) u = np.fromstring(data, np.float64) # Generate received signal d(n) using randomly chosen coefficients coeffs = np.concatenate(([0.8], np.zeros(8), [-0.7], np.zeros(9),                          [0.5], np.zeros(11), [-0.3], np.zeros(3),                          [0.1], np.zeros(20), [-0.05]))  coeffs.dtype = np.int16 d = np.convolve(u, coeffs) # Add background noise v = np.random.randn(len(d)) * np.sqrt(5000) d += v # Apply adaptive filter M = 100  # Number of filter taps in adaptive filter step = 0.1  # Step size y, e, w = adf.lms(u, d, M, step, returnCoeffs=True) # Calculate mean square weight error mswe = adf.mswe(w, coeffs) stream.write(y.astype(np.int16).tostring()) </code></pre>  <p>my goal is to use the LMS algorithm on a wave file</p>
