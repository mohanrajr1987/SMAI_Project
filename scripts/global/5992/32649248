<p>I've figured out two ways of assigning global variables. </p>  <p>The first method assigns an attribute to a function. </p>  <p>The second method changes a global variable name.</p>  <p>I will be implementing this into a text-based adventure game. </p>  <p>What is the difference between these methods. When is each method commonly used. What method is suitable for my task? </p>  <p>Here is the code. </p>  <pre><code># Method 1. Assigning attributes to function.  def coin():     print "You see a coin. Pick it up?"      choice = raw_input("&gt; ")      if choice == "yes":         coin.amount = coin.amount + 1         print coin.amount     elif choice == "no":         print "No monies for you."   # Method 2. Assigning global name within function.   def coin2():     global purse     print "You see a coin. Pick it up?"      choice = raw_input("&gt; ")      if choice == "yes":         purse = purse + 1         print purse     elif choice == "no":         print "No monies for you."  coin.amount = 0 coin()  purse = 0 coin2()  </code></pre>  <p>Note:  Previous answers I've discovered have seem to broad, so I will ask a new question specific to my problem of deciding which is most suitable for a text-based adventure game.</p>
