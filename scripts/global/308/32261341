<p>I'm using C++ and DirectD3D9 to draw a menu. I wish to navigate the menu with the mouse. I can get the mouse position, however, checking if the left button is clicked is proving tricky. I am able to check if it is being held down, but not clicked.</p>  <pre><code>bool LBUTTONDOWN = false; LRESULT CALLBACK LowLevelMouseProc(int nCode, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam) {     if (nCode == HC_ACTION &amp;&amp; (wParam == WM_LBUTTONUP || wParam == WM_LBUTTONDOWN)) {         LBUTTONDOWN = wParam == WM_LBUTTONDOWN;     }     return CallNextHookEx(0, nCode, wParam, lParam); } </code></pre>  <p>How can I add a check to see if I clicked the left button?</p>
