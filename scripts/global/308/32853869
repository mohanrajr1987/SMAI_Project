<p>I'm using GeometricPrimitive for some scene elements, but it's Draw() call always uses TX coords of 0-1 with no opportunity (I think) to change it.  </p>  <p>If I just change the texcoords in the DirectXTk code itself, I can get textures to repeat by using larger texture coordinates; clearly though I don't want to be dependent on hacking the toolkit code.</p>  <p>So, since the Draw() provides a lambda callback, I'm wondering if there's any opportunity to remedy this by updating the texture coordinates.</p>  <p>I'm also using BasicEffect to do the rendering, if that helps.</p>  <p>They use VertexPositionNormalTexture which is publicly accessible.  If that somehow provides me a way to walk their vertex buffer and update the TX coords, that would work for me.  I'm wondering if I can Map() or somehow else access their buffer, walk the vertices, update the TX coords, and hope for the best.</p>  <p>Is this the best (only) approach or is there a better one for GeometricPrimitive?</p>
