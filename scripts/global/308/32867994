<p>I am creating two 2dtextures in d3d11 like this: m_device->CreateTexture2D(&amp;D3D11Tex, NULL, &amp;tex1); m_device->CreateTexture2D(&amp;D3D11Tex, NULL, &amp;tex2);</p>  <p>D3D11Tex.ArraySize = 1;//currently using I read that this value can be kept as two.</p>  <p>But then how do we get 2 textures. Will keeping ArraSize as 2 give me two textures in tex1 and tex2? Or will tex1 be the array of size two.</p>  <p>Any help on this is appreciated. Thanks in advance.</p>
