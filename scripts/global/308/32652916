<p>I'm <em>completely</em> new to DirectX (11) so this question will be extremely basic. Sorry about that.</p>  <p>I'd like to draw a cube on screen that has solid-coloured faces. All of the examples that I've seen have 8 vertices, with a colour defined at each vertex (red, green, blue). The pixel shader then interpolates between these vertices to give a spectrum of colours. This looks nice, but isn't what I'm trying to achieve. I'd just like a cube with six, coloured faces.</p>  <p>Two ideas come to mind:</p>  <ol> <li>use 24 vertices, and have each vertex referenced only a single time, i.e. no sharing. This way I can define three different colours at each 3D position, one for each face.</li> <li>use a texture for each face that 'stretches' to give the face the correct colour. I'm not very familiar with textures right now, so not all that sure about this idea.</li> </ol>  <p><strong>What's the typical/canonical way to achieve this effect?</strong> I'm sure this 'problem' has been solved many, many times before.</p>
