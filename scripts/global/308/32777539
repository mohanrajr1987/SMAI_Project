<p>This question is in continuation to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32769984/how-to-create-array-of-viewports-in-msdn-directx-applications">this</a> question is asked before. I refered to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff634571.aspx" rel="nofollow">this</a> article where it was mentioned that </p>  <blockquote>   <p>to create a split screen game, you might render multiple viewports to a single render target.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I have two viewports and I need to display both of them simultaneously onto the render target. However I am unsure how the code for that would look like. I am fairly new to directx programming and thus am not so familiar with the code flow and the syntax.</p>  <p>Can someone please help me with a sample code for how to render multiple viewports to a single render target.</p>
