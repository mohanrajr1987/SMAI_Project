<p>I have an custom texture class:</p>  <pre><code>class Texture{     ID3D11Texture2D * renderTargetTexture; public:     ...     void saveToTGA(std::wstring filePath); }; </code></pre>  <p>I am using this texture as render target between render passes. I want to write the <code>saveToTGA(std::wstring filePath)</code> method which saves the texture to file (kind of a screenshot).</p>  <p><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ff476298%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">MSDN</a> says that <code>D3DX11SaveTextureToFile(...)</code> is depreciated so I decided to use DirectXTex library as they suggested.</p>  <p>I know I have to use:</p>  <pre><code>DirectX::Image image = ... DirectX::SaveToTGAFile(image, filePath.c_str()); </code></pre>  <p>But the problem is: how to get the <code>DirectX::Image</code> (from DirectXTex) structure based on <code>ID3D11Texture2D</code> ?</p>
