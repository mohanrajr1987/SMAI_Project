<p>This is probably a stupid question, but I cant find good examples on how to approach this, or if its even possible. Im just done with a project where I used gdi to biblt stuff onto a DIB-buffer then swap that onto the screen hdc, basically making my own swapchain and drawing with opengl.</p>  <p>So then I thought, can I do the same thing using directx11? But I cant seem to find where the DIB/buffer I need to change even is.</p>  <p>Am I even thinking about this correctly? Any ideas on how to handle this?</p>
