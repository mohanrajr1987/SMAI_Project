<p>Just implemented the idea with multiple lights (idea without multiple lights is here <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32410189/360-fov-depth-buffer-by-topology-and-2d-shadows">360 FOV depth buffer by topology and 2D shadows</a>), however i'm not sure if its correctly rendered <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFhDiZIHlYQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFhDiZIHlYQ</a> , i just render each scene to the screen with GraphicsDevice.BlendState = BlendState.Additive; with respect to a light, so scenes just added to each other.</p>  <p>And the question - is it seemed correct or not ?</p>
