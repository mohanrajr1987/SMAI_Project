<p>I have the directx sdk from june 2010 installed but I still get this error! Could anyone help me? I am using visual studio 2012. I've tried to reinstall it, include the whole directx sdk in my project but I'm still seeing the same error! Please help me out as I'd like to know how to fix this as it's making me behind on a current project that I'm working on, so if anyone can help me out here I'd be extremely appreciative.</p>
