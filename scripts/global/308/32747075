<p>I would like to know if there's a way to remap a value that goes from 0 to 1 constantly like this.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/FtgwU.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/FtgwU.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Into those values (those are examples).</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Nwrkg.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Nwrkg.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>This might be some function transformation but I can't find the way to do that. I've tried using a lookup texture but in my opinion this is not the best solution.<br> Thank you very much.</p>
