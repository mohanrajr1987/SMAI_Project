<p>I’m going to run the DirectX application on a host machine without actually showing output on the screen. Am i able to connect another monitor and launch game on it, while my default monitor shows different stuff?</p>  <p>I think it could be possible to emulate a monitor, so it's enough to read front buffer using GDI or DirectX to get raw gpu’s output. Am I right? If so, can you tell me how I may implement this, please?</p>
