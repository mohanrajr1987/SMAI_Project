<p>I'm attempting to make a video game in Unreal Engine 4.9. I'm building it for Windows, but I'd like to have it use opengl instead of directx in the executable. However, I've found no options that let you do this. Unreal Engine uses OpenGL when it creates executables for Linux and Mac, but there seems to be no way to use OpenGL with Windows.</p>  <p>Am I missing something? Is there some way to force Unreal Engine to use OpenGL in Windows executables?</p>  <p>EDIT: The reason I want to use OpenGL is because I want this game to run without having to install anything on the end user's computer (DirectX has to be installed to work)</p>
