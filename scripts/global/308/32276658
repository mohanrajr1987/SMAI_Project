<p>I'm having a little bit of a problem with integrating CEF3 into my application. Currently I'm using a texture in default pool with dynamic usage but I'm getting only ~10FPS in the browser. I'm sure that there is some aproach how to do it better if anyone has an idea.</p>  <p>That's my current code where I'm writing buffer to texture.</p>  <pre><code>void CRenderHandler::OnPaint(CefRefPtr&lt;CefBrowser&gt; browser, PaintElementType type, const RectList&amp; dirtyRects, const void* buffer, int width, int height) {     RECT rect = { 0, 0, width, height };     D3DLOCKED_RECT lockedRect = { 0 };      HR(m_pTexture-&gt;LockRect(0, &amp;lockedRect, NULL, D3DLOCK_DISCARD));      unsigned char* bits = (unsigned char*)lockedRect.pBits;     unsigned char* buff = (unsigned char*)buffer;      for (int row = 0; row &lt; height; row++)     {         memcpy(bits, buff, width*4);         bits += lockedRect.Pitch;         buff += width*4;     }      m_pTexture-&gt;UnlockRect(0);     g_pRenderer-&gt;SetTextureReady(); } </code></pre>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
