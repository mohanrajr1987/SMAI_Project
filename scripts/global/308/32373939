<p>Is there a way to completely disable the viewport transform in DirectX 11 or at least define a custom ScreenSpace-to-PixelSpace transformation?</p>  <p>P.S.:</p>  <p>I have read that in older DX versions there used to be things like</p>  <pre><code>pDevice-&gt;SetRenderState( D3DRS_VIEWPORTENABLE, FALSE ); </code></pre>  <p>but I could not find any info on that no MSDN.</p>  <p><em>Background:</em></p>  <p><em>I have a physical camera and I know the view matrix of this camera and a projection matrix which transforms all the way from view space to pixel space. Now I want to simulate the camera image by simply reusing those same matrices in DirectX.</em></p>
