<p>I've developed games using the SFML C++ library for windows desktop, but I want to get into universal app development. I'm new to DirectX, I guess I want to learn about the Direct2D library for universal development. But since this universal stuff is new, there isn't much insight on how to get started. I know how to read Microsoft's documentation, but I assume most of it is based on non-universal development. I need a good tutorial on how to get me started with a basic <em>Hello World</em> app with Microsoft's universal DirectX libraries, and then I can progress myself from there. </p>
