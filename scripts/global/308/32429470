<p>I'm fairly new to DirectX. I have what I think should be a pretty simple question, but I can't seem to find an answer to it anywhere.</p>  <p>Basically, I'd like to know how to add vertices from multiple meshes to a single vertex buffer. This would only happen once per mesh as the program is initialized, so I believe I want DEFAULT usage. </p>  <p>Is It possible to add each mesh to the buffer individually? or do I need to collect them all in a single array and pass them all at once? Default or Dynamic? Map/Unmap or updateSubresource? Thanks</p>  <p>For now I am using an index buffer and drawing once per object (horrible I know) but I am planning on switching to instancing as soon as I figure this out.</p>
