<p>As mentioned in <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ff476480(v=vs.85).aspx" rel="nofollow">this</a> documentation, I need to provide two viewports to a same ID3D11DeviceContext however I could not find any documentation regarding how to create an array of viewports. </p>  <p>I can see in the documentation that we can provide an int number of viewports in the </p>  <pre><code>void RSSetViewports(   [in]                 UINT           NumViewports,   [in, optional] const D3D11_VIEWPORT *pViewports ); </code></pre>  <p>command and provide an array to the D3D11_VIEWPORT devices however I could not find any documentation on how to create an array of two viewports.</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>  <p>I could find an example <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb205126(v=vs.85).aspx" rel="nofollow">here</a> which demonstrates how to use an array of viewports. How it is mentioned there that </p>  <blockquote>   <p>You can create an array of viewports, but only one can be applied to a primitive output from the geometry shader. Only one viewport can be set active at a time</p> </blockquote>  <p>So how do I make sure both my viewports are being displayed all the time? </p>
