<p>The question wasn't formulated exactly right because it's a bit difficult to do in 1 sentence, so the real question is: The function which creates the object representing a device in Direct3D9 looks like this. </p>  <pre><code>  HRESULT IDirect3D9::CreateDevice(     UINT Adapter,     D3DDEVTYPE DeviceType,     HWND hFocusWindow,     DWORD BehaviorFlags,     D3DPRESENT_PARAMETERS *pPresentationParameters,     IDirect3DDevice9** ppReturnedDeviceInterface     ); </code></pre>  <p><code>Adapter</code> UINT argument refers to a particular video card used on target computer but <code>DeviceType</code> argument refers to either <em>HAL</em> or <em>REF</em>. So what's the point of specifying some particular video card (e.g. 0) and <em>REF</em> device type ? Isn't <em>REF</em> some abstract instance which is emulated by processor and doesn't have any relation to video card?  </p>
