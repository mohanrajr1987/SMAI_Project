<p>I want to perfectly sync two screen outputs. I'm working with DirectX11, two screens output on a single video card adapter. Currently my basic algorithm is:</p>  <pre><code>mainloop: {     for (int i=0;i&lt;2;i++)         render the scene for output i      for (int i=0;i&lt;2;i++)         swapchain(i)-&gt;Present() } </code></pre>  <p>Everything is working. But some users report they "feel" both images on two screens are not perfectly in sync. ( I use exactly same screens, and everything is running on the same video adapter).</p>  <p>By doing two <code>swapchain-&gt;present</code> I'm not sure that both are in sync. My question:</p>  <p>Is there a way to be sure both outputs are in sync? For instance, is it possible to have one only swapchain for two outputs?</p>  <p>thanks in advance</p>  <p>Arnaud</p>
