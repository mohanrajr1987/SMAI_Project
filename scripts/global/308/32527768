<p>Can someone explains how intro company logo or some other similar video sequences are presented in modern 3D games?</p>  <p>Is it pre rendered video sequence or it is rendered using DirectX to preserve quality, resolution and aspect ratio.</p>  <p>I understand that it may vary from company to company but I am searching for "best practice" since I can't find that in documentation.</p>
