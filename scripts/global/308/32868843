<p>I wrote a Direct2D application that displays a certain number of graphics.</p>  <p>When I run this application it takes about 4 seconds to display 700,000 graphic elements on my notebook:</p>  <pre><code>Intel Core i7 CPU Q 720 1.6 GHz NVIDIA Quadro FX 880M </code></pre>  <p>According to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd370987%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">Direct2D MSDN page</a>:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Direct2D is a user-mode library that is built using the Direct3D 10.1   API. This means that Direct2D applications benefit from   hardware-accelerated rendering on modern mainstream GPUs.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I was expecting that the same application (without any modification) should have perform better on a different machine with better specs. So I tried it on a desktop computer:</p>  <pre><code>Intel Xeon(R) CPU 2.27 GHz NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960 </code></pre>  <p>But it took 5 seconds (1 second more) to display the same graphics (same number and type of elements).</p>  <p>I would like to know how can it be possible and what are the causes.</p>
