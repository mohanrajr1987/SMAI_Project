<p>My assembly has multiple classes which have fields like this:</p>  <pre><code>private static Foo MyFoo = new Foo(typeof(Bar)); </code></pre>  <p>The argument <code>typeof(Bar)</code> differs for each class.</p>  <p>In my unit tests, I need to extract that argument dynamically.</p>  <p>I can find all classes, and filter for those with a static <code>Foo</code> field. I then have a <code>FieldInfo</code>.</p>  <p>But then I don't know how to get <em>the type of that argument?</em></p>
