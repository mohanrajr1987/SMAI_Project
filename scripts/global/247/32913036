<p>In Java, is is possible to get the "short" identifier for an object type, i.e. without the package affix. In C#, there is some really cool stuff you can do with reflection and methods, particularly with respect to the parameters. </p>  <p>I am trying to get the "short" parameter type from a parameter; however, so far, I have only been able to grab the fully qualified type. Is there a way to grab the short type without performing a substring-oriented operation on the type identifier? </p>  <p>For reference, here is how to get the parameter type:</p>  <pre><code>ParameterInfo parameterInfo = MethodBase.GetCurrentMethod().GetParameters(); parameterInfo[1].ParameterType.ToString(); // do what you want with it, log it, print it, etc.  </code></pre>  <p>I have to log the information to a file; however, I don't want (or need) to reveal package information. </p>  <p>The other issue I am having is that the above call gets the apparent type, not the actual type. Is it possible to get the actual type?</p>
