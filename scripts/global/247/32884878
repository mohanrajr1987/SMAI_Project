<p>In most frameworks (Struts, Spring, Hibernate...) we are specifying the full package names of our class in XML, or annotation.  Framework use this information for looking that class, Instantiating it, looking a method it it, and invoking that method.</p>  <p>All these operations use reflection, and this lookup, instantiation, and invoking is a very frequent in a web application. If reflection is a heavy process (needs more CPU, more memory, and more time consuming), Is it worth to use these frameworks for time critical applications? </p>  <p>Is there any optimization techniques that makes Reflection as fast as normal instantiation, and invoking?</p>
