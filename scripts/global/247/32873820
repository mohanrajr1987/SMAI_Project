<p>I have several classes that contain validation methods in them : ClientValidation, PaymentValidation, etc. The plan is to dynamically build a list of methods that I would use to validate a record. To do this I need to be able to get a list of the methods contained within each class.  To do that I have written the following line:</p>  <pre><code>var methods = typeof( ClientValidation ).GetMethods(); </code></pre>  <p>This works great if all my methods were under the ClientValidation class, but they are not. What I want to be able to do is be able to dynmically pass in the class name so the line could look more like:</p>  <pre><code>var dynamicClassName = GetClassNameMethod();  var methods = typeof( dynamicClassName ).GetMethods(); </code></pre>  <p>Is this possible?   How would I do this?</p>
