<p>I am trying to add a reference to <code>Reflection for UNIX and OpenVMS</code> to my C# project but get the following error </p>  <p><code>A reference to 'Reflection for UNIX and OpenVMS' could not be added</code> </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Q3cPD.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Q3cPD.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Does this mean I do not have that library ? Why would it show up then ? Can I download it and then reference ? I could not find the libraries on their <a href="http://support.attachmate.com/techdocs/2271.html" rel="nofollow">website</a> . </p>
