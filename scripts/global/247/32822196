<p>I am developing an MVC 5 application. I query on my database as:</p>  <pre><code>var result = db.ABCs.AsNoTracking().FirstOrDefault(e =&gt; e.Id == Id); </code></pre>  <p>But what if I want to make a generic method and Don't know the name of the model on compile time. I want to query on any model class that is passed to a method at runtime. Something as :</p>  <pre><code>var result = db.&lt;T&gt;.Where(x =&gt; x.Id == Id).ToList(); </code></pre>  <p>How can I do that. I am using database first approach and no repositories or UoW.</p>
