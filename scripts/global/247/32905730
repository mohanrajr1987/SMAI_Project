<p>Almost 60 classes have a function, which sth like this:</p>  <pre><code>List&lt;Group&gt; groups(int p) {     List&lt;Group&gt; groups = new ArrayList&lt;Group&gt;();     groups.add(new GroupA(p));     groups.add(new GroupB(p));     groups.add(new GroupC(p));      return groups; } </code></pre>  <p>However, it's not readable, and not maintainable (it's more complicated that it is above). What I would like to do is to create generic efficient function something like that:</p>  <pre><code>List&lt;Group&gt; groups(int p) {     return groupFactory(p, GroupA, GroupB, GroupC); } </code></pre>  <p>I have heard about reflection mechanism, however it is very slow and working dynamically. What I should like to have is something which is generated statically, similarly as template in C++.</p>  <p>Thank You.</p>
