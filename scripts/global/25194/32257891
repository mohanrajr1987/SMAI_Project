<p>I have a simple set of tabular data in an unordered list.  I need the table to stay fixed width and have scroll bars appear if the users browser is too small or if they shrink their browser.  Instead, the unordered list is collapsing into itself:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.actionmediadesign.com/unordered_list_table.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.actionmediadesign.com/unordered_list_table.html</a> </p>  <p>I need that unordered list to stay fixed width, regardless of the window size around it.  Thanks in advance for any help with this problem. </p>
