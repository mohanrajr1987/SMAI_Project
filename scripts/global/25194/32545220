<p>Been awhile since I've used CSS, just need some help.</p>  <p>I'm trying to make the height of the main 'Home' bar 25% of the screen. Although I think it's being effected by some sortof alignment issue.</p>  <pre><code>Here's the link to the source code </code></pre>  <p><a href="http://codepen.io/anon/pen/ZbbNqO?editors=110" rel="nofollow">http://codepen.io/anon/pen/ZbbNqO?editors=110</a></p>  <p>Wow, thanks for the helpful feedback guys! I edited the code and I still have some more questions/errors and fixes that you may be able to help with.</p>  <p>Any ideas why the Home menu bar isn't the width of the screen? (the colors are just for identification purposes) Also is there any way of making menu bars 1, 2 and 3 visible simultaneously?</p>
