<p>I have a JSON object that I need to create a list out of.</p>  <p>I would be able to do it fine but each object can have children. It looks something like this : </p>  <pre><code>{     "Boys" :      [         {             "name" : "Fred",             "age" : "65",             "children" : [{                     "name" : "dave",                     "age" : "24",                     "children" : []                 }, {                     "name" : "cliff",                     "age" : "32",                     "children" : []                 }             ]         },           {             "name" : "jon",             "age" : "46",             "children" : [{                     "name" : "jess",                     "age" : "26",                     "children" : []                 }, {                     "name" : "gloria",                     "age" : "19",                     "children" : []                 }             ]         }     ],     "Girls" :      [         {             "name" : "Jane",             "age" : "65",             "children" : [{                     "name" : "dave",                     "age" : "24",                     "children" : []                 }, {                     "name" : "grace",                     "age" : "32",                     "children" : []                 }             ]         },           {             "name" : "ariana",             "age" : "46",             "children" : [{                     "name" : "jessy",                     "age" : "28",                     "children" : []                 }, {                     "name" : "niki",                     "age" : "19",                     "children" : []                 }             ]         }     ] } </code></pre>  <p>I'd be able to go through it fine in a for-loop but I'm unsure how to go through the children too.</p>  <p>Basically I want to go through each element and create a list item with the text being the name of the object I am currently at.</p>  <p>So for the JSON above it would be something like :</p>  <pre><code>-Boys    -Fred       -Dave       -Cliff    -Jon       -Jess       -Gloria -Girls    -Jane       -Dave       -Grace    -Ariana       -Jessy       -Niki </code></pre>  <p>After I create this list I will be using JSTree to format it, any help is appreciated :) </p>
