<p>I have some numbered lists on a website with a wordpress template I'm currently developing. However, I can't see the numbers before numbered lists.</p>  <p>I've set <code>list-style-type: decimal</code> for ol > li and tried some other things, but none seemed to work.</p>  <p>Can somebody help me? (It's probably a really obvious mistake, but I've no more ideas how to do this)</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>  <p><a href="http://goo.gl/VCB77P" rel="nofollow">Example page</a></p>
