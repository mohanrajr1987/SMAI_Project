<p>I'm having an issue where a drop down menu's children are expanding and repositioning to come outside of the parent's bounds. The concerned element is the menu item "BEHANDLINGAR"'s drop down list in IE9+.</p>  <p>Be warned that I am very much a junior developer; this might be apparent from my code. I don't want to discourage general advice, as I do need it, but please focus on the problem at hand first and foremost.</p>  <p>The site is: <a href="http://skinwellnessofsweden.com/hudvard.html" rel="nofollow">www.skinwellnessofsweden.com/hudvard.html</a></p>
