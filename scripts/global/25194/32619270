<p>I am making a testimonials slider and am trying to think of a quick and easy way of sliding through the items.</p>  <p>Currently I have a working version but its not mobile friendly.</p>  <p>My aim (in my head) is to have each testimonial in its own list item, stacked side by side but a container div with overflow hidden only allows one to be shown. I then use javascript to move this div left / right to show a different item.</p>  <p>Here is a current fiddle: <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/92r3yjc9/3/" rel="nofollow">https://jsfiddle.net/92r3yjc9/3/</a></p>  <p>As you can see the divs are vertical, I want them horizontal, but keeping 100% width for each one and then in a div that acts a mask.</p>  <p>The markup currently is:</p>  <pre><code>    &lt;div class="body-container"&gt;     &lt;ul class="testimonial-holder"&gt;         &lt;li class="testimonial"&gt;Lorem ipsum and more Lorem ipsum and more Lorem ipsum and more Lorem ipsum and more Lorem ipsum and more Lorem ipsum and more Lorem ipsum and more Lorem ipsum and more Lorem ipsum and more Lorem ipsum and more Lorem ipsum and more Lorem ipsum and more&lt;/li&gt;         &lt;li class="testimonial"&gt;Lorem ipsum and more Lorem ipsum and more Lorem ipsum and more Lorem ipsum and more Lorem ipsum and more Lorem ipsum and more Lorem ipsum and more Lorem ipsum and more Lorem ipsum and more Lorem ipsum and more Lorem ipsum and more Lorem ipsum and more&lt;/li&gt;         &lt;li class="testimonial"&gt;Lorem ipsum and more Lorem ipsum and more Lorem ipsum and more Lorem ipsum and more Lorem ipsum and more Lorem ipsum and more Lorem ipsum and more Lorem ipsum and more Lorem ipsum and more Lorem ipsum and more Lorem ipsum and more Lorem ipsum and more&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>
