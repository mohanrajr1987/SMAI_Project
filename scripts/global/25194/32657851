<p>i'm looking to create an ordered list (decimal) in which all the items are rag-left aligned with their numerical header. for example:</p>  <blockquote>   <blockquote>     <p>List</p>          <p>1.</p>          <p>This is list item 1</p>          <p>2.</p>          <p>This is list item 2</p>          <p>3.</p>          <p>This is list item 3</p>   </blockquote> </blockquote>  <p>I've been looking around but haven't found any way of implementing this. I still would like to use an  since it scales better than manually entering numbers. Is there anyway to treat and  list as a single col? </p>
