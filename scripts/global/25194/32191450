<p>I have a grid of square divs that are displayed as li in a ul where the ul is styled to be a multiline horizontal list. I want it so the UL is centered (as the number of items per line varies by device size) without having the individual LI centered (as seen in the second row of the diagram).</p>  <p>I've tried positioning them as relative inline-blocks, however that makes the last LI centered in the middle, which is not desirable.</p>  <pre><code>ul {     position:relative;     display:inline-block;     padding:0px;     height:100%;     margin-left:auto;     margin-right:auto; } li {     margin-left:5px;     position:relative;     display:inline-block;     vertical-align: top; } </code></pre>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5wPnU.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5wPnU.png" alt="Layout diagram"></a></p>  <p>Any suggestions that aren't screen-size dependent?</p>
