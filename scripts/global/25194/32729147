<p>I am trying to generate content using values from the skills section of my JavaScript array based on the value of my drop down menu in my html. I am not sure the best way to go about and do this. I have generated the Title, Description, and Image just fine, but I know the skills section will need to be done differently to get it into an Ordered List. Below is my HTML code.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;html&gt;     &lt;head&gt;         &lt;title&gt;WernickeKevin_Assignment1&lt;/title&gt;         &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;     &lt;/head&gt;     &lt;body&gt;          &lt;select id="infoChange"&gt;             &lt;option value="0"&gt;Digital Design 1&lt;/option&gt;             &lt;option value="1"&gt;Interactive Production 1&lt;/option&gt;             &lt;option value="2"&gt;Motion Graphics 1&lt;/option&gt;             &lt;option value="3"&gt;Web Programming 1&lt;/option&gt;         &lt;/select&gt;          &lt;div&gt;             &lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;                &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;             &lt;ol&gt;                 &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;                 &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;                 &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;             &lt;/ol&gt;             &lt;img src=""&gt;         &lt;/div&gt;        &lt;/body&gt;     &lt;script src="js/courses.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/html&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Here is my JavaScript File containing my Array with Objects and some other code.
