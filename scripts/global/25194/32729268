<p>i host several customized roundcube installations. so siteA.com installation of roundcube accesses email accounts at serverA.com, and so on. I would like to create a list element in the login process that steers the login to the relative email account server. Someone would go to siteA.com enter their email, password, and choose from a dropdown list, and hit login. the dropdown list choice would direct the login to the appropriate server needed for the email account. I understand that the incorrect dropdown list choice for an email would result in errors - and it should. the person logging in would have to know which server corresponded to their account. I need direction on how to incorporate that dropdown and supporting resources into the login page of roundcube.</p>
