<p>I am using paged list for mvc 4. I have a view with a model with pagedlist. I am building a navigation menu that is going to show all the results and not paged results. I have another model with all the results, and i need to use that. How can i use that model with paged list model?</p>  <pre><code>@model PagedList.IPagedList&lt;DAL.Response.SearchedQuestionsResponse.Question&gt;    &lt;ul class="navigationLvLeft"&gt;    //here i want to use my other model     @model List&lt;DAL.Response.SearchedQuestionsResponse.Question&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt; </code></pre>
