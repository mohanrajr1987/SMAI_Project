<p>I was studying a couple PHP frameworks and then decided to build my own, of course. But i'm facing one issue. I have a Router class that handles  dynamically the HTTP requests and it basically explodes the URL into elements dividing it by the slash and storing it into an array, then a function is called to check if the first element is a valid Controller. If it is valid, the function should require it, but that's where i'm stuck, because it seems that i can't require a file like:</p>  <pre><code>if (file_exists(CONTROLLERS_DIR . $this-&gt;url[0] . '.php')) { require \App\Controllers\$this-&gt;url[0] } </code></pre>  <p>How can I require a file like that using namespaces?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
