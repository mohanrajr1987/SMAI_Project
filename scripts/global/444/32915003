<p>I have the default action that displays all items from a table:</p>  <pre><code>public ActionResult Index() {     var items = db.ProductSet.ToList();     return View(items); } </code></pre>  <p>I added another action to the controller, that should display only items where a field equals a particular value:</p>  <pre><code> public ActionResult Details(string _key) {      System.Guid gkey = new Guid(_key);      var items = db.ProductSet.Single(c =&gt; c.pKey == gkey);      return View(items); } </code></pre>  <p>I call it with the following url:</p>  <pre><code>http://localhost:57955/Details/ABBA9914-B55A-48A0-B436-00041FFAEAA7 </code></pre>  <p>and get an error: The resource cannot be found. </p>  <pre><code>Description: HTTP 404. The resource you are looking for (or one of its dependencies) could have been removed, had its name changed, or is temporarily unavailable.  Please review the following URL and make sure that it is spelled correctly.   Requested URL: /Details/A88A9914-B56A-48A0-B436-00041FFAEAB5 </code></pre>  <p>Can anyone help me resolve this issue?</p>
