<p>I'm working on a small spring mvc project which requires to add api version to the request urls for example: <code>http://host.serice.com/api/1.0/documents</code>. As my understanding i can implement like this:</p>  <pre><code>@RestController @RequestMapping(value="/api/1.0") public class DocumentController { } </code></pre>  <p>In my opinion, it's not a good idea because i have to hard code the version number to all controllers, once the version number increase i have to reupdate the controllers again, this work may violate "open for extension closed for modification" principle. Do you have any idea for this ?</p>
