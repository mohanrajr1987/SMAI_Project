<p>I am new to web development. I am planning to create a web service which is going to act as a back end for both web site and mobile application. I want to know if it is possible to use same method to return data in different type.</p>  <p>For example: If i use <a href="http://somewebsite/getdetails.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://somewebsite/getdetails.jsp</a> should give me and modelView return type and <a href="http://somewebsite/getdetails.json" rel="nofollow">http://somewebsite/getdetails.json</a> should give the model in json format.</p>  <p>I don't want to create two different controller to handle this.</p>  <p>If there is any other better way also please share your comments.</p>  <p>I am open for alternative solutions too </p>
