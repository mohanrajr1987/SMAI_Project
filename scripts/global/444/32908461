<p>I have a web app I want to convert to MVC based on the <a href="http://www.nathandavison.com/article/11/custom-php-mvc-tutorial-part-1-introduction" rel="nofollow">Nathan Davidson MVC-Framework</a>. I would like to know how <strong>in general</strong> I can manage a model that do not need a view, <strong>and particularly</strong>, a database class.</p>  <p>I realize it would be more understandable with an example. I have a basic <code>Database</code> class that within the constructor - creates a connection to the database, within the destructor - closes that connection, and contains a <code>query</code> method that executes an SQL query:</p>  <pre><code>class Database {     private $conn;      public function __construct()     {         $this-&gt;conn = mysqli_connect("localhost", "root", "", "fanfiction");          if(mysqli_connect_error())            die("Connection faild: ".mysqli_connect_error());     }      public function __destruct()     {         mysqli_close($this-&gt;conn);     }      public function query($sql)     {         return mysqli_query($this-&gt;conn, $sql);     } } </code></pre>  <p>That class is used by three classes: <code>Search</code>, <code>Create</code>, and <code>Update</code>. Each of them analyzes the end-user input, manipulates it, and uses the <code>query</code> method to execute some actions based on the results. The problem is that none of them is visible to the end-user, so there is not a View for any of them.</p>  <p>I thought I could just use a Model without associating it with any View, but the <code>BaseController</code> (An abstruct class for all Controllers to inherit from) is always creating an instance of the View class (Which of course, handle the View aspect of the app), so I must associate it with a View.</p>  <p>So - now more understandable - my questions are the follow:</p>  <ol> <li><strong>In general - In a MVC-based app, how to handle a model that has no view?</strong></li> <li><strong>In my particular case - hot to handle the database? How to organize my files and classes?</strong></li> </ol>  <p>I google it but I could not find any reference to that issue, so I hope I am not re-asking an answered question.</p>  <p>Hope it's not too stupid questions. Thank you again.</p>
