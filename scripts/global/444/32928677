<p>I'm using CodeIgniter framework to develop a web application in PHP and I have a doubt that I would like to clarify. </p>  <p>In my application I have the following code:</p>  <p>At the users controller I have the clickAdd function:</p>  <pre><code>public function clickAdd(){     redirect('object/add','refresh');    } </code></pre>  <p>An anchor tag in my users view.php</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php echo anchor('user/clickAdd','Add');?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>The problem is:</p>  <p>I have seen that is normal to just use </p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php echo anchor('object/add','Add');?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>But ins't this last method against the MVC pattern? Because its redirecting to another controller from the view itself.</p>  <p>And if so, what is the right aproach to do this redirection? Because the first method doesnt convince me that much either.</p>
