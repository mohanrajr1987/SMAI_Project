<p>I'm not sure if i got the right concept.</p>  <p>I was told by people that </p>  <p>Boundary = View</p>  <p>Entity = Model</p>  <p>Control = Controller</p>  <p>however based on my knowledge of MVC. (fat model, thin controller)</p>  <p>Isn't the Boundary = Controller, Control = Model (the busienss logic) and Entity = Model (The orm classes or similar entity classes which does only crud ).</p>  <p>I may be wrong,  please guide me! </p>
