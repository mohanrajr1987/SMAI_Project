<p>I am trying to create a photo gallery using mvc and want to know if I can avoid creating several individual views for each gallery.</p>  <p>Here is how I plan on it being structured:</p>  <p><strong>/Media/Photos</strong><br> This page will list one cover picture for each gallery with the gallery's title.<br> i.e<br> Gallery 1<br> Gallery 2</p>  <p>Is there a way to use one individual view and from /Media/Photos when they click an Image Link it will navigate them to Media/Photos/GalleryTitle</p>  <p>Based on the title I will show the correct images.</p>  <p><strong>/Media/Photos/Gallery1</strong><br> This page will display all individual photos in gallery 1<br> <strong>/Media/Photos/Gallery2</strong><br> This page will display all individual photos in gallery 2 </p>  <p>and so on</p>  <p>If I can't do this I will have to create a view for every single gallery.</p>  <p>One thing to note is that I will not be pulling anything from the database. It will all be static.</p>
