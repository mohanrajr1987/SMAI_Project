<p>If you've worked with Identity 2.0, you've seen this piece of code:</p>  <pre><code>       public static AppIdentityUserManager Create(             IdentityFactoryOptions&lt;AppIdentityUserManager&gt; options,             IOwinContext context)         {            [snip]             var dataProtectionProvider = options.DataProtectionProvider;              if (dataProtectionProvider != null)             {                 manager.UserTokenProvider =                     new DataProtectorTokenProvider&lt;AppIdentityUser&gt;(                         dataProtectionProvider.Create("ASP.NET Identity"));             }             return manager;         } </code></pre>  <p>I understand that.  In my application options.DataProtectionProvider (obviously passed in as a parameter) is null.  How and where is that set (or not as the case may be?)  Every place I've looked has that exact snippet of code, but no explanation for setting the DataProtectionProvider.</p>
