<p>I have a currently loaded form with different fields in it. Example I am on URL: <a href="https://localhost:44300/" rel="nofollow">https://localhost:44300/</a> where the form is currently displayed. However, once of the fields has a link beside it "View Full List" where in once I click on that it will redirect me to a different view and user can select one value from there. </p>  <p>View full list when clicked will be redirected to: <a href="https://localhost:44300/project/organisationfulllist/" rel="nofollow">https://localhost:44300/project/organisationfulllist/</a></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/OhBjI.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/OhBjI.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Now, once I have selected from the displayed list in that view (radiobutton list), I will click on a [SAVE] button and it should redirect me back to my original form with URL <a href="https://localhost:44300/" rel="nofollow">https://localhost:44300/</a></p>  <p>My question is when I am redirecting to the original view, the previous inputs on several fields were reset. What I want is to preserve these inputs from user. Is there a way to sort of save the session of the previous form?</p>
