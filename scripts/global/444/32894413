<p>I have a guest list and it is working using a viewmodel, paging, searching, etc.</p>  <p>I would like to be able to select a guest, and show everyone at the table on the same view in a separate column.  I understand how to do it by refreshing the entire page (I can just send the table number to the controller and filter based on that).  I would prefer to do it in a partial view.</p>  <p>One problem I am encountering (among others) is the current page is filtering based on a search criteria, so if I pass the current set of Guest model data it wont include everyone at the table because of the filtered data.</p>  <p>How can I call another action and render it on a partial view?</p>  <p>I am trying something like this but my view is crashing (wont even display) so I don't know where to start troubleshooting.  You will see below my idea is the Table Action link call the GetTableNumber Action then I want to send information to the partial view using that controlller action.  I learning a lot with MVC but still very new to Javascript.</p>  <pre><code>@foreach (var item in Model)             {                 &lt;tr&gt;                     &lt;td&gt;                         &lt;strong&gt;@Html.DisplayFor(modelItem =&gt; item.FullName)&lt;/strong&gt;                         &lt;br /&gt;                         &lt;small&gt;@Html.DisplayFor(modelItem =&gt; item.Company)&lt;/small&gt;                     &lt;/td&gt;                     &lt;td&gt;                         @Html.DisplayFor(modelItem =&gt; item.Table.TableNum)                     &lt;/td&gt;                     &lt;td&gt;                         &lt;h4&gt;@Html.ActionLink("Table", "GetTableNumber", new { tablenumber = item.Table.TableID })&lt;/h4&gt;                         &lt;h4&gt;@Html.ActionLink("Edit", "Edit", new { id = item.ID })&lt;/h4&gt;                     &lt;/td&gt;                 &lt;/tr&gt;             }         &lt;/table&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;div class="col-md-6"&gt;         @{ Html.RenderPartial("_TableGuestPartial"); }     &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>
