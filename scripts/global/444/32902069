<p>New to ASP.NET MVC, but I have been looking around for quite some time and thinking how to achieve dynamically generate views based on the model? I have spent quite number of days reading articles online but I get confused at the end of day, so decided to ask a question, please help (if possible)..</p>  <p>I have about <strong>25+ maintenance tables that requires CRUD functionality</strong>, so I wouldn't want to create + maintain 25 views and controllers.</p>  <p>It should be managed via a single controller and view based on the model supplied from Menu itself (as generics). How best to achieve this type of functionality?</p>  <p>Am pretty sure some of you have already implemented this type of functionality, it would be good if you share some insights?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!
