<p>I'm new to  MVC and I use  DB first approach and Entity Framework. I have imported my custom Stored Procedures that are returning mostly complex types. So far OK. I see also code - object created in <code>Context.cs</code>. Now where (in a Controller?) and how to call stored procedures and also add related view? I don't prefer <code>linQ</code> or raw <code>sql</code> query methods</p>  <p>An example of SP is:</p>  <pre><code>create proc Test1 @company_name varchar(50) ) as (  select * from Profile where greek_name like '%' + @company_name + '%' </code></pre>
