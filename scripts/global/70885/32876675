<p>I'm new using d3 but it is kind of making me crazy with something that seems so simple, basically I'm using the partition graph from d3, my idea is that when I click an element I will change it fill color to red, that's not a problem, pretty easy, however I want to also change all of its descendants fill color to red. I can access the children data and children of children data and would only need a recursive function to change the color, however what I cannot seem to access is the rect element associated with each child. I've tried the d3.select(child).style("fill", "red") function but it does not work, I'm guessing I'm doing something wrong but can someone point me in the right direction?</p>  <p>I have this locally but I am basically using this same example (I added jquery to my solution) <a href="http://mbostock.github.io/d3/talk/20111018/partition.html" rel="nofollow">http://mbostock.github.io/d3/talk/20111018/partition.html</a></p>  <p>In there, using firebug I set a breakpoint in partition.html on line 84. To hit that breakpoint I just click on a blue box in the graph and from there what I want is to be able to select the rect or the g elements associated to the one I clicked.</p>  <p>Again, I now I can do d.children[0] to get the data for the first child, but I do not know from there how to access/edit it css to change the color of it's fill.</p>  <p>Any help will be appreciated, also, I know I might not have given the best explanation, I'll gladly answer any question or try to clarify any confusion.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
