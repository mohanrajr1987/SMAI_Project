<p>I am trying to use force layout sample: </p>  <p><a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1093130" rel="nofollow">http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1093130</a></p>  <p>and implementing a collision detection described as in </p>  <p><a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3231298" rel="nofollow">http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3231298</a></p>  <p>But this sample is used only for circles. Is there a way to modify this sample so we can prevent collision on "g" nodes?</p>
