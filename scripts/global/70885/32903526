<p>I'm using d3's SVG axes generator to prepare a datetime axis but the labels are overlapping:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ejUUW.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ejUUW.png" alt="screenshot"></a></p>  <p>Obviously I could drop the font-size in CSS until it fits (and you can't read it) but feels like d3 ought to be clever enough to fit labels - it's a pretty basic requirement of an axis generator and it's very well developed, and already has some recognition of the need to choose labels appropriately. So this leads me to think it's not d3 at fault but me! I've <a href="https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/SVG-Axes" rel="nofollow">RTM</a>'ed but it doesn't seem to say anything about the font and size etc.</p>
