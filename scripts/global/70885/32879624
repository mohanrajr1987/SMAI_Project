<p>This question builds on Lars Kotthoff's very helpful answer to the problem of transitioning with a D3 sunburst diagram that is based on different JSON data: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22312943/d3-sunburst-transition-given-updated-data-trying-to-animate-not-snap">d3 - sunburst - transition given updated data -- trying to animate, not snap</a></p>  <p>I've tried <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/jTV2y/3/" rel="nofollow">the final fiddle that Lars provided</a> but when there is more than one transition, the animation still fails and we get snapping. The problem can be seen in <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/jTV2y/41/" rel="nofollow">this updated fiddle that contains a second transition</a>.</p>  <p>From what I can tell, the <code>x0</code> and <code>dx0</code> values are not properly stored with the path object when calling the <code>arcTweenUpdate</code> function. When I check what the <code>this</code> object looks like inside <code>arcTweenUpdate</code> function, I get an [object SVGPathElement] at the beginning of the function when <code>this.x0</code> and <code>this.dx0</code> are read, and I get an [object Window] when the new values are written later. I'm relatively inexperienced with JS but that seemed like it could point to the problem. </p>  <p>Any help with addressing this and making the above fiddle work for multiple transitions (e.g. back and forth between the two JSONs) is highly appreciated. Thanks! </p>
