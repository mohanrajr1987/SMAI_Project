<p>I want to visualize events on the globe in real time. I have data (lat, longs) coming in continuously and I want to be able to send that data (json of latitude and longitude) to my d3 script and plot (with transition) the latitude, longitude on the map. I know how to draw a map using d3. Only problem is I am confused as to how can I make an <strong>endpoint</strong> in d3/HTML which when hit can update the visual. Also, there can be numerous responses in each second so how wil I be able to handle multiple requests at the same time. </p>  <p>I think architecture of this system is getting too complicated for me. Any suggestion will be really helpful.</p>
