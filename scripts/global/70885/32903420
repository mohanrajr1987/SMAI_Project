<p>I'm drawing a scatter plot with d3js. Using a simple linear scale with 1,2,3,4,5. This creates equal space like:</p>  <p><code>1     2      3       4      5</code></p>  <p>problem is, I have more data points between 2 and 3, 3 and 4. less data points between 1 and 2, 4 and 5. Is it possible to configure the scale to look like: </p>  <p><code>1 2      3                4 5</code></p>  <p>or instead of linear scale I should try some other scales? Please suggest.</p>
