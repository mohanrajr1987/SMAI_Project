<p>I am trying to build a charting application using svg and d3 (for desktop now, but might start supporting mobile later). The chart has multiple components like comments (which can be rich text) and images at various z-index embedded into the application.</p>  <p>I wanted to keep the chart pure svg, so that I might not get inconsistencies when implementing a feature in the future because part of it is svg and part of it is HTML (foreign object).</p>  <p>I was compelled to use foreign object when I had to display a rich text comment, and as I progress there are places where using foreign object would make it a lot less painful implementation (tables, tooltips). So I was intrigued wether my fear for avoiding HTML content into SVG is misplaced.</p>  <p>What is the real tradeoff I am making here? Pros and cons considering the following features, d3 and svg in mind?</p>  <p>Features in mind:</p>  <ol> <li>Different chart types</li> <li>Save chart (probably phantomjs)</li> <li>Display images above chart, as background to charts</li> <li>Rich text comment boxes in chart</li> <li>Annotations on chart (where you draw free form on entire svg container)</li> <li>Tool tips as and when necessary.</li> <li>Displaying small ui components that are better addressed by tables.</li> <li>Different chart transitions.</li> </ol>
