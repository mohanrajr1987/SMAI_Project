<p>I've seen some examples that read from a MySQL database by basically using a php file as a controller, we have something that looks like</p>  <pre><code>d3.text("mapread.php", function(txt) {     d3.selectAll("#loading").remove();     txt.split("\n").forEach(function(line,i) {         line.split(",").forEach(function(d,j) {             data[i][j]=parseFloat(d);             d3.selectAll(".r"+i+".c"+j).style("fill",function() {return cScale(data[i][j]);});         })     }); }) </code></pre>  <p>and a php script that has our DB connection information and queries. One of the examples I was looking at can be found here: <a href="http://www.jeromecukier.net/blog/2012/01/02/using-d3-with-a-mysql-database/" rel="nofollow">http://www.jeromecukier.net/blog/2012/01/02/using-d3-with-a-mysql-database/</a> .</p>  <p>Is it possible to have this controller script actually be Python rather than PHP? Does the rendering of the script happen server-side, so I would just have to have a server with Python installed? Who actually runs the script during the client/server exchange? </p>
