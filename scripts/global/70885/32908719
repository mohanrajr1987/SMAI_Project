<p>I have next situation: I made a lib that draws charts. I have zooming there. When you triggering 'mousewheel' event - chart rerendering with new scale. But there is a trouble in almost all browsers(except of chrome). In chrome you are getting 'mousewheel' event many times on one wheel move. In other browsers you getting event, chart's rerendering, and there are no more events and you should make more moves to get events. Does anybody know how to resolve this problem? Or maybe i have a bad architecture of code?</p>  <p>here is wheelHandler:</p>  <pre><code>function wheelHandler() {     var pad = d3.event.type === 'mousewheel' ? d3.event.wheelDeltaY / 10 : d3.event.detail,     newKoefficient = koefficient + pad;     newKoefficient = Math.max(newKoefficient, config.minZoom);     newKoefficient = Math.min(newKoefficient, config.maxZoom);     if (newKoefficient !== koefficient) {         koefficient = newKoefficient;         render();     } } </code></pre>  <p>While rendering i emptying svg-container and re-building elements in it</p>  <p>Thank you, mates</p>
