<p>This is now driving me insane. I've read pretty much all the posts on this, and still cannot work out how to do it efficiently, i.e. not trial and error.</p>  <p>I have a map of Sweden, and I basically want to zoom into the map using a lat/lon position as the center point (14.4W, 57.2N). My projection variable settings are as follows:</p>  <pre><code>var projection = d3.geo.albers()   .center([0, 57.2])   .rotate([14.4, 0])   .parallels([50, 60])   .scale(900 * 3)   .translate([width / 2, height / 2]); </code></pre>  <p>At the default scale (150), the map centers properly. When I try to scale up however, I don't understand why the 14.4W, 57.2N position is not remaining in the center of the canvas?</p>  <p>Can anyone please shed some light?
