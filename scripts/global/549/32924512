<p>I am trying to setup SVN Ubuntu Server (VPS) using the svn:// protocol  all working perfect for example i have 2 users harry(read,write),sally(only read) and i dont want the repository to be displayed by anonymoys/guests only by users. no matter what configuration i setup the anonymous/guests can view the repository, and  The line "anon-access = none" didnt change anything.</p>  <p>Command Daemon - >> svnserve -d -r /svn/repos/</p>  <p>---> Configuration</p>  <p><strong>Authz</strong> </p>  <pre><code>    ### This file is an example authorization file for svnserve.     ### Its format is identical to that of mod_authz_svn authorization     ### files.     ### As shown below each section defines authorizations for the path and     ### (optional) repository specified by the section name.     ### The authorizations follow. An authorization line can refer to:     ###  - a single user,     ###  - a group of users defined in a special [groups] section,     ###  - an alias defined in a special [aliases] section,     ###  - all authenticated users, using the '$authenticated' token,     ###  - only anonymous users, using the '$anonymous' token,     ###  - anyone, using the '*' wildcard.     ###     ### A match can be inverted by prefixing the rule with '~'. Rules can     ### grant read ('r') access, read-write ('rw') access, or no access     ### ('').      [aliases]     # joe = /C=XZ/ST=Dessert/L=Snake City/O=Snake Oil, Ltd./OU=Research Institute/CN=Joe Average      [groups]     # harry_and_sally = harry,sally     # harry_sally_and_joe = harry,sally,&amp;joe      [test_project:/]     harry = rw     sally = r     # &amp;joe = r     # * =      [repository:/baz/fuz]     # @harry_and_sally = rw     # * = r </code></pre>  <p><strong>Passwd</strong></p>  <pre><code>### This file is an example password file for svnserve. ### Its format is similar to that of svnserve.conf. As shown in the ### example below it contains one section labelled [users]. ### The name and password for each user follow, one account per line.  [users] harry = password sally = password </code></pre>  <p><strong>Svnserve.conf</strong></p>  <pre><code>### This file controls the configuration of the svnserve daemon, if you ### use it to allow access to this repository.  (If you only allow ### access through http: and/or file: URLs, then this file is ### irrelevant.)  ### Visit http://subversion.apache.org/ for more information.  [general] ### The anon-access and auth-access options control access to the ### repository for unauthenticated (a.k.a. anonymous) users and ### authenticated users, respectively. ### Valid values are "write", "read", and "none". ### Setting the value to "none" prohibits both reading and writing; ### "read" allows read-only access, and "write" allows complete  ### read/write access to the repository. ### The sample settings below are the defaults and specify that anonymous ### users have read-only access to the repository, while authenticated ### users have read and write access to the repository. anon-access = none auth-access = write ### The password-db option controls the location of the password ### database file.  Unless you specify a path starting with a /, ### the file's location is relative to the directory containing ### this configuration file. ### If SASL is enabled (see below), this file will NOT be used. ### Uncomment the line below to use the default password file. password-db = passwd ### The authz-db option controls the location of the authorization ### rules for path-based access control.  Unless you specify a path ### starting with a /, the file's location is relative to the ### directory containing this file.  The specified path may be a ### repository relative URL (^/) or an absolute file:// URL to a text ### file in a Subversion repository.  If you don't specify an authz-db, ### no path-based access control is done. ### Uncomment the line below to use the default authorization file. authz-db = authz ### The groups-db option controls the location of the groups file. ### Unless you specify a path starting with a /, the file's location is ### relative to the directory containing this file.  The specified path ### may be a repository relative URL (^/) or an absolute file:// URL to a ### text file in a Subversion repository. # groups-db = groups ### This option specifies the authentication realm of the repository. ### If two repositories have the same authentication realm, they should ### have the same password database, and vice versa.  The default realm ### is repository's uuid. realm = My First Repository ### The force-username-case option causes svnserve to case-normalize ### usernames before comparing them against the authorization rules in the ### authz-db file configured above.  Valid values are "upper" (to upper- ### case the usernames), "lower" (to lowercase the usernames), and ### "none" (to compare usernames as-is without case conversion, which ### is the default behavior). # force-username-case = none ### The hooks-env options specifies a path to the hook script environment  ### configuration file. This option overrides the per-repository default ### and can be used to configure the hook script environment for multiple  ### repositories in a single file, if an absolute path is specified. ### Unless you specify an absolute path, the file's location is relative ### to the directory containing this file. # hooks-env = hooks-env  [sasl] ### This option specifies whether you want to use the Cyrus SASL ### library for authentication. Default is false. ### This section will be ignored if svnserve is not built with Cyrus ### SASL support; to check, run 'svnserve --version' and look for a line ### reading 'Cyrus SASL authentication is available.' # use-sasl = true ### These options specify the desired strength of the security layer ### that you want SASL to provide. 0 means no encryption, 1 means ### integrity-checking only, values larger than 1 are correlated ### to the effective key length for encryption (e.g. 128 means 128-bit ### encryption). The values below are the defaults. # min-encryption = 0 # max-encryption = 256 </code></pre>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/OvxT1.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/OvxT1.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
