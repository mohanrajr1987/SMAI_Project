<p>I've built a command line using Nodejs, I was developing it on windows, than after I published it on npm, I installed it from Ubuntu, then I tried to use it, it says that there is no such file.</p>  <p>I'm not sure of what is the problem, I have doubt that it's from this line :</p>  <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env node </code></pre>  <p>I also tried to clone the repo from ubuntu, and I run the command</p>  <pre><code>npm link </code></pre>  <p>and it worked ! can someone please tell me what did I do wrong ?</p>  <p>Here is the whole repo on <a href="https://github.com/Javascipt/detail" rel="nofollow">github</a> and the package on <a href="http://npmjs.com/package/detail" rel="nofollow">npm</a></p>
