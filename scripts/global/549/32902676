<p>I am using a client server architechture, and the client side is on the blender.</p>  <p>Since, client has to infinitely wait for the text from server, I have used an infinite while loop. But, Blender freezes the moment I run the script, it doesn't show anything happening in each step, and when I end the execution manually using command line, it just shows the last step executed.</p>  <p>The script works perfectly if run outside blender. I am using Blender 2.74 on ubuntu.</p>  <p>Any suggestions?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
