<p>I created an Ubuntu container on Nitrous.io so that I can develop on my chromebook without the chromebook's limitation. I am having trouble using mongodb. I followed these steps to install it:</p>  <pre><code>~ sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv 7F0CEB10  ~ echo "deb http://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu "$(lsb_release -sc)"/mongodb-org/3.0 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-3.0.list  ~ sudo apt-get update  ~ sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org  ~ sudo service mongod start </code></pre>  <p>I can't connect to mongo through the mongo shell. I get this error message:</p>  <pre><code>MongoDB shell version: 3.0.6 connecting to: test 2015-10-02T21:13:56.629+0000 W NETWORK  Failed to connect to 127.0.0.1:27017, reason: errno:111 Connection refused 2015-10-02T21:13:56.630+0000 E QUERY    Error: couldn't connect to server 127.0.0.1:27017 (127.0.0.1), connection attempt failed     at connect (src/mongo/shell/mongo.js:179:14)     at (connect):1:6 at src/mongo/shell/mongo.js:179 exception: connect failed </code></pre>  <p>I have tried deleting the lock file and creating a 'data' directory and then setting the dbpath to that directory:</p>  <pre><code>~ sudo rm /var/lib/mongodb/mongod.lock  ~ sudo service mongodb restart </code></pre>  <p>and</p>  <pre><code>~ mkdir data  ~ cd data  ~ mongod --dbpath . </code></pre>  <p>The Ubuntu container is 64 bit 14.04 I believe Nitrous uses Docker containers if that makes a difference. I don't think I have direct root access, but I have sudo access which doesn't require a password. More generally, has anyone else had a lot of problems installing Mongo? I can never seem to get it to just install smoothly.</p>
