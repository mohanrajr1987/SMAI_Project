<p>I'm working on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. When I try to open any python script the default path it shows is '/home/username' and my files are located at '/home/username/Documents/python' which i want to be the default directory when i want to save or open some files. I have already tried os.chdir() but it didn't worked. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1810743/how-to-set-the-current-working-directory-in-python">I have seen this but didn't worked</a>.Thanks in advance</p>
