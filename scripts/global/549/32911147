<p>I'm making a python bot that will interact with websites by taking screenshots, analysing the image and generating movement. I'm working in Ubuntu 15.4 and I want this bot to essentially work in the background, so I'd like for it to take screenshots of an inactive desktop workspace and make it's movements there, so that I can work on other things in an alternate workspace. By workspace, I mean ctrl-alt-(left,right,up,down).</p>  <p>I run the following code</p>  <pre><code>from pyscreenshot import grab from matplotlib import pyplot as plt time.sleep(10) im = grab() plt.imshow(im) </code></pre>  <p>Once I hit run, I switch to a blank workspace, wait a few seconds and then in my new workspace an image pops up of my blank desktop, not of the workspace running the code. </p>  <p>I don't need an explanation of why this doesn't work, I can see that. What I'm looking for is a clever workaround. Thanks in advance. </p>  <p>To see my current task click <a href="http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-build-a-python-bot-that-can-play-web-games--active-11117" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>
