<p>I recently started using Ubuntu 15.04 and I'm trying to install Java for it using apt-get. The problem that I'm facing is that I get the following message:</p>  <p>W: Failed to fetch <a href="http://in.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/vivid/Release.gpg" rel="nofollow">http://in.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/vivid/Release.gpg</a>  Unable to connect to 172.16.19.10:80:</p>  <p>I have no clue of what and how it should be done. Please help!</p>
