<p>I'm running a Ubuntu 14.10 server with LAMP on virtual cloud hosting.</p>  <p>The server is usually doing very well with response time&lt;0.5s. However, the problems start at peak hours, mainly Monday-Wednesday/Thursday, with response times at around 7-8 seconds or more.</p>  <p>According to Google Analytics: The website has got some ~5 million page views per month, and during peak hour some 12-13.000 thousand page views per hour.</p>  <p>Apache and MySQL are running on the same machine.</p>  <p>We've tried the naive solution, increasing from 1 CPU core and 2GB RAM to 2 cores and 4 RAM. While not experiencing any great improvement, we also tried increasing to 4 cores and 8 RAM. CPU usage is however very low and lots and lots of RAM free, according to <code>top</code>. Here's an example:</p>  <pre> Tasks: 209 total,   2 running, 206 sleeping,   0 stopped,   1 zombie %Cpu(s):  2.0 us,  0.4 sy,  0.0 ni, 97.6 id,  0.0 wa,  0.0 hi,  0.0 si,  0.0 st KiB Mem:   8176696 total,  1495244 used,  6681452 free,    80892 buffers KiB Swap:        0 total,        0 used,        0 free.   802216 cached Mem </pre>  <p>I've installed <code>munin</code> to try to see if I find any problems, but all I see is a bunch of graphs and no obvious problems. The problems section (Critical, Warning, Unknown) is empty.</p>  <p>I activated the mysql-slow-query log, it's empty.</p>  <p>I installed <code>mytop</code> to monitor mysql queries but nothing shows up. I guess queries are too quick. Even with <code>-s 0.1</code> there's no output. Here's an example of the mytop output:</p>  <pre>  Queries: 33.3M    qps:  218 Slow:     0.0         Se/In/Up/De(%):    94/00/00/00  Sorts:     0 qps now:  158 Slow qps: 0.0  Threads:    1 (   1/   7) 92/00/00/00  Cache Hits: 27.8M Hits/s: 182.2 Hits now: 144.0  Ratio: 89.1%  Ratio now: 98.6%  Key Efficiency: 100.0%  Bps in/out: 19.0k/85.8k   Now in/out: 13.1k/70.1k         Id      User         Host/IP         DB       Time    Cmd    State Query        --      ----         -------         --       ----    ---    ----- ----------    541972      root       localhost                     0  Query          show full processlist </pre>  <p>I'm not sure what my next step is in order to find the source of the problem at peak hours...</p>
