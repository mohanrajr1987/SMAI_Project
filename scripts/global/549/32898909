<p>I have <code>Alt+Tab</code> configured to switch All Windows and <code>Alt+`</code> for switching windows within the Current Application.  I'd like to have <code>Alt+Tab</code> to switch applications, and show only one icon for each of them.<br> The picture shows what I get with three Firefox windows.  This I don't like. </p>  <p>P.S. Don't mind the pixelated icons, I'm writing another question for that. </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/JBJ4m.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/JBJ4m.png" alt="Task Switcher with several Firefox windows"></a></p>
