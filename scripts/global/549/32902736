<p>I was trying to setup sublime text editor to connect via sftp on my server but was getting connection timeout all the time.  I found a solution and followed this article : <a href="http://superuser.com/a/957666">http://superuser.com/a/957666</a></p>  <p>They suggested to change the server config to accept a mac algorithm used by the client by adding this <code>hmac-sha1</code> on <code>KexAlgorithms</code>.  So in <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>, I changed:</p>  <pre><code>KexAlgorithms diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256,diffie-hellman-group14-sha1,diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1 </code></pre>  <p>to</p>  <pre><code>KexAlgorithms diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256,diffie-hellman-group14-sha1,diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1,hmac-sha1 </code></pre>  <p>And now i try to login on my server and i get <code>Network error: Connection refused</code></p>  <p>How can i regain access to my server? My server is hosted on kimsufy.</p>
