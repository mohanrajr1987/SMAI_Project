<p>I am using ubuntu, I have installed npm and Nodejs in order to install gulp. I installed gulp globally using the following command <code>npm install --global gulp</code>, After that I have installed glup in my project using the following command: <code>npm install --save-dev gulp</code>. However, When I try to run the command <code>gulp</code> I receive this error <code>bash: /usr/local/bin/gulp: No such file or directory</code>. I also receive the same error when I try to run this command: <code>gulp --version</code></p>  <p>Solutions I attempted:<br> I have run this command <code>./node_modules/.bin/gulp</code> in order to get  gulpfile.js to be executed though. However I still Receive the same error.  </p>
