<p>I tried to configure a project in MonoDevelop on Ubuntu, to use EntityFramework with Npgsql provider, by following <a href="http://www.npgsql.org/doc/ef6.html" rel="nofollow">official steps</a>.</p>  <p>However, something seem to be wrong with that suggested configuration file (or I'm missing something), as I can't get rid of this error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The Entity Framework provider type 'Npgsql.NpgsqlServices, Npgsql.EntityFrameworkLegacy, Version=2.1.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=5d8b90d52f46fda7' registered in the application config file for the ADO.NET provider with invariant name 'Npgsql' could not be loaded. Make sure that the assembly-qualified name is used and that the assembly is available to the running application. See <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=260882" rel="nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=260882</a> for more information.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Does anyone have a simple working example of the application connecting to PostgreSQL using Entity Framework in MonoDevelop?</p>
