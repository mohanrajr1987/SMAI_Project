<p>I found a similar question on stack overflow and tried following the directions as specified there for redirecting a request for example.com to load /var/www/example.com/public_html/index.php</p>  <p>I am trying to setup friendly urls.<br> On Ubuntu, I have a vhost file inside /etc/apache2/sites-available/example.com.conf</p>  <p>If I put DirectoryIndex index.php in there, it fails to restart apache.  I do use the a2ensite command on Ubuntu to create the simlink to the sites-enabled directory.</p>  <p>I also tried putting  DirectoryIndex index.php index.html index.pl in the /etc/apache2/mods-available/dir.conf file but still that doesn't load the php file that exists in my directory /var/www/example.com/public_html and then I try to load example.com in the browser. I read somewhere that posting on stack overflow I should use example.com in place of the actual domain name.  </p>  <p>I then found a post on using the .htaccess file to redirect from index.html to index.php.  What I am trying to achieve is to have example.com serve index.php.  </p>  <p>Logic suggested that if I edit the /etc/apache2/mods-available/dir.conf and put index.php first and then put the other file types, mime-types after that, it would prefer index.php over index.html</p>  <p>Here is my .htaccess file:</p>  <pre><code>Options +FollowSymLinks DirectoryIndex index.php  RewriteEngine on  RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} ^[A-Z]{3,9}\ /.*index\.php\ HTTP/ RewriteRule ^(.*)index\.php$ /$1 [R=301,L]  RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} ^[A-Z]{3,9}\ /.*index\.html\ HTTP/ RewriteRule ^(.*)index\.html$ /$1index.php [R=301,L] </code></pre>  <p>This is in the directory /var/www/example.com/public_html  which is the DocumentRoot for the domain I am trying to serve. Can anyone tell me what I am doing wrong?  Or how to get this right? Thanks, Bruce</p>
