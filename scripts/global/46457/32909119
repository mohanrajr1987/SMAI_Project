<p>I am trying to join two large data.tables in R using <code>dplyr</code> package and <code>inner_join</code> function:  Table 1: 300k rows x 60 col Table 2: 300k rows x 5 col</p>  <p>I have read all possible solutions on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">SO</a>, including <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1395229/increasing-or-decreasing-the-memory-available-to-r-processes">this</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25949862/blocked-from-accessing-more-memory-in-r-despite-having-available-memory-in-my-sy?lq=1">this</a>. Also searched through available solutions on internet, but solutions like memory.limit() and similar did not worked. I have a WIN 64-bit and R 64-bit with 8 GB RAM. </p>  <p>Any help is apreciated. </p>
