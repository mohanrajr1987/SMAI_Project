<p>I have several dataframes and would like to add columns with a loop. At the moment the code looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>FR1$MONTH&lt;-'2015-01' FR2$MONTH&lt;-'2015-02' FR3$MONTH&lt;-'2015-03' FR4$MONTH&lt;-'2015-04' </code></pre>  <p>I have tried the following:</p>  <pre><code>for (i in 1:12) {    assign(paste("FR",i,$,"MONTH",sep=""),paste("2015-",i,sep=""))  } </code></pre>  <p>Unfortunatly it doesnt work. </p>  <p>Can anybody tell me what is wrong with my try, or even better: How to do this right as I suspect a loop isnt the best solution.</p>
