<p>I use summary(myDataFrame) in R, in order to create a summary of my data. My data frame contains logical, numeric and char values. The output produced by this command produces a very ungly summary. It leaves several blank lines in lots of cases, while there are no lines in other cases. Also, the fields in the resulting table are not alighned.</p>  <p>Is there a way to produce a better looking summary? It can be in excel or pdf as well.</p>
