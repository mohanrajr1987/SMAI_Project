<p>I have the following issue. I would like to know how I can assign rows containing information of different columns (the data in the columns is in different classes - factor, integer, logical) to a data frame without some of the fields being indexed, but to get the value of them.  Now when I assign it to the data frame some of the columns contain the values that I need in char format, while the others are just indexes referring to values. </p>  <pre><code>data[i,2:ncol(data)] &lt;- listing[listing$ID == subset$ID[agrep(matchstring, subset$Street, max.distance = 3)], ] </code></pre>
