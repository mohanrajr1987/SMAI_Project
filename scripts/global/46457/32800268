<p>I'm fairly new to R so please bare with me if I'm not so familiar with the vector manipulation stuff. I have a data frame with 4 columns. On one of the columns I added a date so that each value looks like this </p>  <pre><code>&gt;print(result[[4]][[10000]]) [[10000]] [1] "Jan"  "14"   "2012" </code></pre>  <p>That means that on the 1000'th field of the 4th column I have these 3 fields. This is the only column that is multiple.</p>  <p>Now the other 3 columns of the data frame result are single values not multiple. One of those columns, the first one, has the states of the United States as values. What I want to do is create a new data frame from column 2 and 4 (the one described above) of the result data frame but depending on the state.</p>  <p>So for example I want all the 2nd column and 4th column data of the state of Alabama. I tried this but I don't think it is working properly. "levels" is the 2nd column and "weeks" is the 4th column of the data frame result.</p>  <pre><code>rst &lt;- subset(result, result$states == 'Alabama', select = c(result$levels, result$weeks)) </code></pre>  <p>The problem here is that subset is copying all the columns to rst and not just the second and fourth ones of the result data frame that are linked to Alabama state which are the only ones I want. Any idea how to do this correctly?</p>  <p><em>Edit to add the code</em></p>  <p>I'm adding the code here since I think there must be something I'm not seeing here. First a small sample of the original data which is on a csv file</p>  <pre><code>st      URL                         WEBSITE                 al      aln     wk          WEEKSEASON Alabama http://adph.org/influenza/  Influenza Surveillance  Level 1 Minimal Oct-04-2008 40  2008-09 Alabama http://adph.org/influenza/  Influenza Surveillance  Level 1 Minimal Oct-11-2008 41  2008-09 Alaska  http://adph.org/influenza/  Influenza Surveillance  Level 1 Minimal Oct-18-2008 42  2008-09 Alaska  http://adph.org/influenza/  Influenza Surveillance  Level 1 Minimal Oct-25-2008 43  2008-09 </code></pre>  <p>And this is the code</p>  <pre><code>#Extracts relevant data from the csv file extract_data&lt;-function(){    #open the file. NAME SHOULD BE CHANGED   sd &lt;- read.csv(file="sdr.csv",head=TRUE,sep=",")    #Extracts the data from the ACTIVITY LEVEL column. Notice that the name of the column was changed on the file   #to 'al' to make the reference easier   lv_list &lt;- sd$al   #Gets only the number from each value getting rid of the word "Level"   lvs &lt;- lapply(strsplit(as.character(lv_list), " "), function(x) x[2])    #Gets the ACTIVITY LEVEL NAME. Column name was changed to 'aln' on the file   lvn_list &lt;- sd$aln    #Gets the state. Column name was changed to 'st' on the file   st_list &lt;- sd$st    #Gets the week. Column name was changed to 'wk' on the file   wk_list &lt;- sd$wk   #Divides the weeks data in month, day, year   wks &lt;- strsplit(as.character(wk_list), "-")    result&lt;-list("states"=st_list,"levels"=lvs,"lvlnames"=lvn_list,"weeks"=wks)    return(result)  }  forecast&lt;-function(){    result=extract_data()    rst &lt;- subset(result, states == 'Alabama', select = c(levels, weeks))    return(0) #return results } </code></pre>
