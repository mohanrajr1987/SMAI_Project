<p>I am trying to make a list and access it's cells later in R. I am new to R and have a Matlab background. These <code>[]</code>, <code>[[]]</code> are really bugging me.  I tried reading the help and online but I still don't get it. In the following code <code>c["var1"][1]</code> returns differently than <code>c$"var"[1]</code>. </p>  <p>What are the actual uses for these three notations <code>[]</code>, <code>[[]]</code>, <code>$</code>?</p>  <pre><code>v &lt;- vector("character", 5) v[1] &lt;- 'a' v[2] &lt;- 'a' v[4] &lt;- 'a' v # [1] "a" "a" ""  "a" ""  c &lt;- list(v, v) names(c) &lt;- c("var1", "var2") c # $var1 # [1] "a" "a" ""  "a" ""   # $var2 # [1] "a" "a" ""  "a" ""   c["var1"][1] # $var1 # [1] "a" "a" ""  "a" ""   c$"var1"[1] # [1] "a" </code></pre>
