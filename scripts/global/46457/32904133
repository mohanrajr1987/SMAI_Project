<p>I have the following problem:<br> I am creating a flexible number of data.frames (or matrices would do the job as well) which are filled until the last one, which is not full and should therefore be treated differently<br> I now want to call the data.frame plate<code>n</code> and want to fill it afterwards with data. I would like to do something like</p>  <pre><code>assign(paste0("plate", n)[x,y], %some data%) </code></pre>  <p>where <code>[x,y]</code> is the position in the data.frame(/matrix) and <code>n</code> is the n'th data.frame however it allways gives me</p>  <pre><code>incorrect number of dimensions </code></pre>
