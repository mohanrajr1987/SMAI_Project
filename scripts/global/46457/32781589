<p>I have a purely numeric data frame, whose columns I want to stack (concatenate) together. <code>stack</code> does a good job:</p>  <pre><code>foo &lt;- matrix(rnorm(100),20,5) foo &lt;- data.frame(foo) bar &lt;- stack(foo) </code></pre>  <p>However, I don't like the default column names given by <code>stack</code>, i.e., <code>values</code> and <code>id</code>. Of course, I can change them with</p>  <pre><code>colnames(bar) &lt;- c("x","y") </code></pre>  <p>but I was wondering if there was any function which would allow me to define the column names of the resulting (stacked) data frame.</p>
