<p>I have a recently made data.frame that has three columns, Date, Time, and Data. I'm looking to combine the date and the time variables into one Date.Time variable.</p>  <p>My data.frame is called, <code>data_dataframe</code> and looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>Date     Time   Data 1/26/94  13:00  8.4 </code></pre>  <p>I tried:</p>  <pre><code>as.POSIXct(paste(data_dataframe$Date, data_dataframe$Time), format="%d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%S") </code></pre>  <p>but this didn't work. Reading around didn't seem to help my problem. Any tips?</p>
