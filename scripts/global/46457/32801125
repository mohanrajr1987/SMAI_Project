<p>I am trying to write a function that can count the number of non-NA values from a data frame. I have 10 files with injured player data for every day for different sports. Row Heads are "SL" "Sport" "Players" "Days" (data is collected for 62 days).  I have combined them in one data frame and am counting the number of non NA values.  Problem  - The function I have written only works if I input an integer ("16") but for a string input ("12:16") the function output is incorrect.  Below is my code. Any help on why this error is happening will be most welcome. I am absolutely new to R and have given up after a lot of effort. </p>  <pre><code>players &lt;- function(directory, days = 1:62) {         files &lt;- list.files(directory, full.names=TRUE)         combin &lt;- data.frame()         for(i in 1:10){                 combin &lt;- rbind(combin, read.csv(files[i]))                 }         combin_subset &lt;- combin[which(combin[,"Days"] %in% days),]         for(i in 1:length(days)){                 nobs &lt;- sum(!is.na(combin_subset$Days))                 }         return(data.frame(days, nobs)) } </code></pre>  <p>I am trying to create an output that is tabular and shows the number of non NA values for each day. Any help on where I am going wrong is most welcome. </p>
