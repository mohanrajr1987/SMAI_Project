<p>This is somewhat a follow-up on a previous <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26893023/nas-are-not-allowed-in-subscripted-assignments">question</a> where the idea is to replace a given value in data.frame based on multiple conditions. </p>  <p>Here is a simple example that works, with base R:</p>  <pre><code>df &lt;- data.frame( var1=c("k",2,NA,6,5,"K","k",1),               var2=c(4,2,6,0,9,1,3,2),               var3=c("d","d","d","d","d","d","n","f")) df      var1 var2 var3 1    k    4    d 2    2    2    d 3 &lt;NA&gt;    6    d 4    6    0    d 5    5    9    d 6    K    1    d 7    k    3    n 8    1    2    f </code></pre>  <p>The objective is to modify the value <code>var1==k</code> &amp; <code>var3==n</code>by say a factor of 9:</p>  <pre><code>df$var2[df$var1=="k" &amp; df$var3=="n"] &lt;- df$var2[df$var1=="k" &amp; df$var3=="n"]/9 </code></pre>  <p>However, the actual df of interest generates the error message stated in the above question. The answer provided therein, negate NA's with each condition, <code>df$var1=="k" &amp; !is.na(df$var1)</code> solves the issue with ample lines of code.</p>  <p>My question: is there a simpler solution using let's say <code>plyr</code>?</p>
