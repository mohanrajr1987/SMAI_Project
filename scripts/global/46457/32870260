<p>I have what I think should be a pretty easy R Programming problem I'd like some help with.</p>  <p>I have 6 dataframes (QB, RB, WR, TE, FLEX, DST). All 6 of these dataframes have 4 columns, 3 in particular that we need to work with. </p>  <p>These columns are "Name", "Salary", and "Points."  The 4th column just indicates what position the player is.</p>  <p>Here is what the QB dataframe looks like.</p>  <pre><code>            Name      Points    Salary   Position   19       Eli Manning 16.226   7000       QB   4      Aaron Rodgers 19.940   7900       QB   26      Sam Bradford 15.166   6000       QB   29 Teddy Bridgewater 14.450   5700       QB   22       Andy Dalton 15.376   5900       QB   2        Andrew Luck 20.546   7800       QB   10     Carson Palmer 17.942   6800       QB   28      Kirk Cousins 14.274   5400       QB   31       Josh McCown 13.500   5100       QB   7         Drew Brees 19.788   7400       QB   3     Peyton Manning 19.268   7200       QB   11         Matt Ryan 18.708   6900       QB   5     Russell Wilson 19.704   7100       QB   13     Philip Rivers 17.218   6100       QB   25  Matthew Stafford 16.112   5700       QB   18        Alex Smith 15.874   5600       QB   30        Nick Foles 14.480   5100       QB   6         Cam Newton 19.982   7000       QB   24        Derek Carr 15.358   5300       QB   23    Brandon Weeden 15.062   5100       QB   20    Jameis Winston 15.596   5100       QB   14       Jay Cutler* 17.208   5500       QB   9       Tyrod Taylor 18.492   5800       QB   21      Ryan Mallett 16.160   5000       QB   15     Blake Bortles 16.764   5100       QB   12  Colin Kaepernick 18.216   5500       QB </code></pre>  <p>I want code that will generate all the combinations of names that satisfy the following criteria:</p>  <p>1 Name from QB<br> 2 Names from RB (can't be the same one twice)<br> 3 Names from WR (must be 3 different names)<br> 1 Name from TE<br> 1 Name from FLEX (this dataframe is a binding of RB, WR, and TE. The name from this in the output must not be one of 6 names already picked from the 2 RBs, 3 WRs, and 1 TE)<br> 1 Name from DST  </p>  <p>The sum of all the salaries must be less than OR equal to 50000.</p>  <p>So the output would be a data frame with 11 columns, (QB, RB1, RB2, WR1, WR2, WR3, TE, FLEX, DST, Salary, Points) with the Salary column being the sum of the salaries, the Point column being the sum of the Points, and the other 9 columns just being the name.  The output could also be 3 columns, with the first column just being the 9 names, and then a pointsum column and salarysum column.</p>  <p>I see a semi solution <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26495000/fantasy-football-linear-programming-in-r-with-rglpk">here</a>.  I'm not familiar with the Rglpk package used there but it looks like that will just generate the 1 lineup that maximizes points, but I want to be able to look at not just the "best" lineup but also the next 100 or so that have very comparable totals for the pointsum.</p>  <p>Yesterday I tried to just do it with one dataframe of all the players, and have it generate all the combos, at which point I would then start filtering out the illegal lineups (2+ QBs, etc) but R said there were too many combos so it couldn't do it.  I guess ~250^9 is pretty huge.</p>  <p>After that error message I started trying to sort of cheat and have it generate just all the combinations of 3 WR, then all the combinations of 2 RB, and was going to have it generate the lineups using those chunks of players, but it just seems like there should be a more elegant and pure solution.</p>
