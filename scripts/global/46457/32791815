<p>I have a data frame consisting of records like the following. A typical row of the data frame, df[1,] looks as follows</p>  <pre><code>84745,"F",70,7,"Single",2,"N",4,9,1,1,3,4,4,"2 day","&lt;120 and &lt;80",0,8,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1 </code></pre>  <p>I want to convert it into a variable like myvar below which is of the following type</p>  <pre><code>myvar = list( list(84745,"F",70,7,"Single",2,"N",4,9,1,1,3,4,4,"2 day","&lt;120 and &lt;80",0,8,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1)) </code></pre>  <p>I have tried doing the following, but it doesn't work to convert it to a list of lists.</p>  <pre><code>myvar &lt;- as.list(as.list(as.data.frame(t(df[1,])))) </code></pre>  <p>How can I do that?</p>  <p>EDIT : I have tried myvar = list(unclass(df[14,])). It however fails the call since the formatting of the output myvar is slightly different.</p>  <p>Format of the original line of code</p>  <pre><code>[[1]] [[1]][[1]] [1] 21408  [[1]][[2]] [1] "M"  [[1]][[3]] [1] 69  [[1]][[4]] [1] 3  [[1]][[5]] [1] "Widowed" </code></pre>  <p>Format of myvar = list(unclass(df[14,]))</p>  <pre><code>[[1]] [[1]]$ID [1] "21408"  [[1]]$GenderCD [1] "M"  [[1]]$Age [1] "69"  [[1]]$LOS [1] "3"  [[1]]$MaritalStatus [1] "Widowed" </code></pre>
