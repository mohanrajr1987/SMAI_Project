<p>I have a data.frame that looks somewhat like this.</p>  <pre><code>k &lt;- data.frame(id = c(1,2,2,1,2,1,2,2,1,2), act = c('a','b','d','c','d','c','a','b','a','b'), var1 = 25:34, var2= 74:83) </code></pre>  <p>I have to group the data into separate levels by first 2 columns and write the mean of the the next 2 columns(var1 and var2). It should look like this</p>  <pre><code>     id act varmean1 varmean2    1   1   a            2   1   c           3   2   a           4   2   b           5   2   b           6   2   d        </code></pre>  <p>The values of respective means are filled in varmean1 and varmean2.</p>  <p>My actual dataframe has 88 columns where I have to group the data into separate levels by the first 2 columns and find the respective means of the remaining. Please help me figure this out as soon as possible. Please try to use 'dplyr' package for the solution if possible. Thanks.</p>
