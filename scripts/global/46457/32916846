<p>I have two data frames - one contains raw data points and the other contains rule. The first data frame can be created using the code below -</p>  <pre><code>set.seed(1) df = data.frame(x=ceiling(abs(rnorm(50)*100)), y= ceiling(abs(rnorm(50)*10))) </code></pre>  <p>The second data set looks like below. It contains rules.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/tohaB.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/tohaB.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I want two new variables - "x_WOE" and "y_WOE" to be created in <strong>df</strong> and it would contain values exist in "WoE" named column based on the rules exist in "Cutpoint".</p>  <p>In other words, i am trying to apply these rules to df to create binned data. I want the following conditions to be generated :</p>  <pre><code>IF(x&lt;=14) then x_WoE = -0.787; IF(x&lt;=26) then x_WoE = -0.5196; so on... </code></pre>
