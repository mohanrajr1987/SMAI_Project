<p>I am using R and have a data frame which has four columns. One of them is numeric, and another one has lists in each row:</p>  <pre><code>column_1    column_2    column_3    column_4 a           x           1           c("334", "538", "645", "763") b           y           2           c("762", "838") c           z           3           c("78", "85", "529", "797", "859") d           p           3           c("8", "75", "242", "766") e           q           4           c("85", "447", "529", "797", "859") </code></pre>  <p>I want to order by data frame by column_3, and in case of a tie, in lexicographcal ascending order of column_4.</p>  <p>The example above is how my data frame looks after I sort my data frame using column_3 and column_4 as follows:</p>  <pre><code>df &lt;- df[order(df$column_3, df$column_4),] </code></pre>  <p>However, my expected output is that row 2 should appear after row 3 since 78 is smaller than 762. Is it possible to do that? </p>
