<p>Here is code to generate some sample data:</p>  <pre><code>set.seed(1000) dat &lt;- data.frame(A = runif(5, -5, 5),                   B = runif(5, -5, 5),                   C = runif(5, -5, 5)) </code></pre>  <p>Data:</p>  <pre><code>          A          B         C 1 -1.721213 -4.3226204 -1.500625 2  2.588465  2.3871486  2.554616 3 -3.860636  0.8353505 -1.829158 4  1.907551 -2.8422860  3.658128 5  0.164024 -2.4387760  2.641607 </code></pre>  <p>I want to compare each column and return a <code>TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code> depending on whether or not there there a negative or positive value as we go down by row. For example, in row 4 of columns A and B, we would get <code>TRUE</code>. Because one is positive and the other is negative. If it were swapped (a negative value in A for that row but positive in B) then it would also return <code>TRUE</code>.</p>  <p>However, if either of the two values being compared is between 1 to -1, the comparison won't happen and it will just return <code>NA</code>. Here is what the final output should look like for this example:</p>  <pre><code>          A          B         C    AB    BC    AC 1 -1.721213 -4.3226204 -1.500625 FALSE FALSE FALSE 2  2.588465  2.3871486  2.554616 FALSE FALSE FALSE 3 -3.860636  0.8353505 -1.829158    NA    NA FALSE 4  1.907551 -2.8422860  3.658128  TRUE  TRUE FALSE 5  0.164024 -2.4387760  2.641607    NA  TRUE    NA </code></pre>  <p>I have tried to compare rows using this kind of logic:</p>  <p><code>if((dat$A &gt; 1 &amp; datB &lt; -1) | (dat$A &lt; -1 &amp; dat$B &gt; -1) == TRUE)</code>...</p>  <p>But I think there must be a more efficient way of doing it. </p>  <hr>  <h2>Edit after seeing some of the answers:</h2>  <p>There are many great answers here that all have worked when I tested them out. I like the answer by mpalanco the best because of its readability and succinctness. However, I have chosen the answer by DMC since it can be generalized to other cases and may be useful for someone else searching for an answer to this or similar questions.</p>
