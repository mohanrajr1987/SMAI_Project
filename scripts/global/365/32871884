<p>I'm using python scrapy to crawl a page but the page has some js. So I found a solution using docker that render the page and now I can use xpath to get the information I need. But when I try to use "response.url" ,on my parse, I get the docker server url "0.0.0.0.0:8050". Any tips to get the url from the site rendered by docker?</p>  <p>Sry my poor english, isn't my native lang.</p>  <p>Thx for your attention.</p>
