<p>I am looking for a filter/action hook (or any other way) to change image URL that is displayed on cart page as a thumbnail.<br/> Example image: <a href="http://jamescollings.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/cart-donation-form.png" rel="nofollow">http://jamescollings.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/cart-donation-form.png</a></p>  <p>I found that it is retrieved via <code>$_product-&gt;get_image()</code> method, but I could not find anything similar to <code>$_product-&gt;set_image()</code>.</p>
