<p>Ok SO hopefully not a difficult question to answer but we have a webpage that has a search field.</p>  <p>When looking through how people move through the website we notice an issue that we can not replicate.</p>  <p>So: people use the website to search for holiday lets.</p>  <p>they run through the search field (putting in future dates, people, nights) and when they hit submit they then get directed to properties available "this weekend" and the rest of the fields become blank.</p>  <p>If that makes sense, We cannot replicate this issue though so not sure on its fault.</p>  <p>I could post the code but at present just after ideas.</p>
