<p>I created a small utility code in JAVA that reads a webpage using buffered reader and parse selective content from it. The source code and other details are present <a href="https://github.com/aj95/Stalker_SPOJ" rel="nofollow">here</a>. The tool works fine but from past some time, the code is not working. I tried debugging the code but I've noticed that the code is unable to read the web page source using simple buffered reader anymore like it used to. I am specifically reading the URLs "www[dot]spoj[dot]com/status/[username]/signedlist/". An example of such a url is <a href="http://www.spoj.com/status/aj95/signedlist/" rel="nofollow">this.</a> Here, [username] are different usernames. I used the below code to check if I am able to read webage source.</p>  <pre><code>import java.io.BufferedReader; import java.io.IOException; import java.io.InputStream; import java.io.InputStreamReader; import java.net.URL; import java.net.URLConnection;  class MyClass {  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {     try {         String MyUrl = "http://www.spoj.com/status/aj95/signedlist/";         URL url = new URL(MyUrl);         URLConnection con = url.openConnection();         InputStream inputstream = con.getInputStream();         BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(inputstream));         String line = null;         int line_read = 0;          while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {             line_read ++ ;         }         System.out.println(line_read);     } catch (Exception e) {         System.out.printf("\n Oops! Something went wrong!\n\n");     } } } </code></pre>  <p>The code gives the <code>output : 0</code> meaning I am unable to read the source unlike I used to earlier. What can be possible reason ? Is it possible that there is some change in the webpage security that is not allowing buffered reader to work. Is there any other way to do the same task as the buffered reader is expected to do i.e reading the webpage source.? I tried reading using Scanner but to no avail. I cannot change the basic logic of my utility code, so please suggest a replacement for reading the url source.</p>
