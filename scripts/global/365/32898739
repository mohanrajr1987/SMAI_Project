<p>first of all, I want to apologize for my English level. I am currently looking <strong>to turn a folder into a php file</strong> (php page). This may seem hard to understand, but in reality it is very simple. Maybe is it just my formulation that is bad. Clearly this is what I want to do:</p>  <ul> <li>I have a page name <strong>manage.php</strong> that serves as home to manage ads and allows a member to choose the ad he wants to manage.</li> <li>I have another page named <strong>update.php</strong> that allows the member to update his announcement.</li> <li>I would like my manage.php page to act as a folder so that my URL address of my update.php page is <strong>www.example.com/manage/update.php</strong>.</li> </ul>  <p>In other words, I would like my page update.php to become a sub-page (I can not find other terms/words in my head?) of the page manage.php ! My question is, should I create unnecessarily  a folder named "manage" or can I link these two pages differently?</p>
