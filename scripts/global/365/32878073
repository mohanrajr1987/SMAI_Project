<p>I have a meteor app that uses iron-router.</p>  <p>How do I make this meteor app create a fixed URL for sharing?</p>  <p>For example in jsfiddle.net, you start of in just <code>jsfiddle.net</code> PLAINLY.</p>  <p>However, after you type in the code, etc...and you decide you wanna share this with the world, you click on save.  After you click on save, the link above changes to something like: <code>jsfiddle.net/m9mfLn3p/</code>. And now you can use <code>jsfiddle.net/m9mfLn3p/</code> to share that page with that certain setting with the world....</p>  <p>How do I achieve something similar in my meteor app that uses iron-router?</p>  <p>Thank you very much.</p>
