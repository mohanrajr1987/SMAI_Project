<p>I'm able to retrieve the full URL like: <a href="http://www-click08-co-uk/wonga.php" rel="nofollow">http://www-click08-co-uk/wonga.php</a><br> and I need to retrieve the script name "wonga" from it.</p>  <p>The url will be changing depending on what page the user is on and I will always need the word or phrase after the / and not including the .php, in the example above I would like to create a variable with the value of this being wonga</p>  <p>This is the code I currently have, where "argos" is, is where the database is searched and responds with the information I need, this is where the vaiable would be used</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php //----------------------------------------------------- // Include files and set Classes //----------------------------------------------------- require_once $_SERVER["DOCUMENT_ROOT"] . "/includes/common.php";   $db = new dbConnection(); $directorydata = new directorydata(); $phoneDirectory = new phoneDirectory();  $conn = $db-&gt;pdoConnect(); // Load the directorydata row via the row ID - 543 is "best buy" //$directorydata-&gt;get($db, 543);  // Load the directorydata row via the url alias field $directorydata-&gt;get($db, "Argos");  // Phone number isn't formatted coming out the DB $formattedPhoneNumber = $phoneDirectory-&gt;formatPhoneNumber($directorydata-&gt;Number1);  ?&gt;  </code></pre>
