<p>In a Wordpress blog, a post with a lot of visits got deleted. I can write a new one but I want to reuse the old URL, because people saved the link.</p>  <p>However the permalinks are based on <code>ID+name_of_post</code> and I can't create a new post with the same <code>ID</code>. I also can't make a redirection because Wordpress considers my old post non-existent. </p>  <p>And of course, my post isn't in the trash.</p>  <p>How to do this?</p>
