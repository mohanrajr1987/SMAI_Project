<p>I want to remove the <code>index.php</code> from the url to access the controller action. Therefore I added the following code in my <code>.htaccess</code> file in the <code>public/</code> folder:</p>  <pre><code>Options +FollowSymLinks RewriteEngine On  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteRule ^ index.php [L] </code></pre>  <p>I would be grateful if anyone reply me and solve this issues.</p>
