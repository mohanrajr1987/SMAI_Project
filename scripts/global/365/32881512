<p>I have an URL that comes from customer setting. This URL is after modification used for HTTP redirection, and my app needs to append own parameters do the query string. Because original URL can be quite complicated and there is no defined format of this URL it's quite tricky task from my opinion.</p>  <p>Is there some utility class in Spring applications how to modify existing URLs to accomplish this task? I would like to use something like - create new URL object from this URL string, append these query string pairs (key,value) and get me final URL (that respects related RFCs).</p>
