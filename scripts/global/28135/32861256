<p>I need to create an Oracle function that takes a string as parameter. The string contains letters and numbers. I need to extract all the numbers from this string. For example, if I have a string like <strong>RO1234</strong>, I need to be able to use a function, say <code>extract_number(RO1234)</code>, and the result would be <strong>1234</strong>. </p>  <p>To be even more precise, this is the kind of sql query which this function would be used in.</p>  <pre><code>SELECT DISTINCT 'column_name', extract_number(column_name)  FROM 'table_name'  WHERE extract_number(column_name) = 1234; </code></pre>  <p>QUESTION: How do I add a function like that to my Oracle database, in order to be able to use it like in the example above, using any of Oracle SqlDeveloper or Sql Tools client aplications?</p>
