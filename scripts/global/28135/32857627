<p>I have Solaris machine where DB is already installed, and environment variable is already present for Oracle Data base. Now I am trying to Install the OBIEE on the same machine and it throw the error INST-08109. I have google and tried the possible way line unset ORACLE_HOME and commenting the environment on bash_profile and i tried to echo $ ORACLE_HOME and it display nothing which means it got unset. Then again I stated the OBIEE installer but still it show me the same error.</p>
