<p>I have a requirement where i read table_name from user_tables and append 6 letters after the table_name at run time for e.g.</p>  <pre><code>prev_table_name= F_ALIGN_PROF_PRD_MTH_SLS_NM2 New_table_name = prev_table_name_ABCDE  </code></pre>  <p>so new table name is exceeding the limit of 30 characters and i am getting an error.</p>  <p>to overcome this problem i am looking for a method so i can shorten the table_name at run time and append my 6 letters to it.</p>  <p>Kindly suggest any workaround fo this problem</p>
