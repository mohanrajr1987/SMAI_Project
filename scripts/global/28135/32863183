<p>We have deployed our application in two application servers(Tomcat Server) with clustering environment. Now request is coming from two servers at the same time so concurrency issue is happening it means it's creating duplicate entries in database. Scenario is :  1. Request (Transaction) A Update data  2. Request (Transaction) B Update data at a same time  3. Two row will be added into that table. among that one is duplicate.</p>  <p>Let's say I have methods with following signature</p>  <p>Request A</p>  <pre><code>updateData() {     //get entity manager   //start transcation tx   //persist   //commit tx } </code></pre>  <p>Request B</p>  <pre><code>updateData() {   //get entity manager   //start transcation tx   //persist   //commit tx } </code></pre>  <p>We want to prevent scenarios like this. Request A only should persist a data into that table. Help us to solve this issue. #thanks Environment details:   JPA 2.1 and Oracle database </p>
