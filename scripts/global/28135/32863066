<p>I have one doubt. I am trying to pull data from oracle and want to push it into <code>HDFS</code> using <code>sqoop 1.4.6</code>.<br>The table which I want to migrate contains column named "<code>COMMENT</code>"(which is a reserved keyword in oracle), but when I tried to push table into <code>HDFS</code> using <code>sqoop</code>, the error occurred was:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>15/09/30 14:52:49 ERROR db.DBRecordReader: Top level exception:    java.sql.SQLSyntaxErrorException: ORA-00936: missing expression</p> </blockquote>  <p>I have tried by putting <code>\ and "</code> for this column as: <code>"\"\"COMMENT\"\""</code> when I listed column names during query</p>  <p>so how to get this error fixed..</p>
