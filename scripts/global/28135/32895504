<p>I have a list of csv values, as in ('one','two', 'three','four'), and these values also exist in database in a column.</p>  <p>Now I want to know all the value's in the csv list, which DO NOT exist in database.</p>  <p>For example if my database column has values 'one', 'three', 'five', 'six', 'seven'.</p>  <p>Then my result should return values 'two' and 'four', as these exist in my list but do not exist in database.</p>  <p>sounds like its something simple, but I am stuck.</p>  <p><a href="http://sqlfiddle.com/#!4/04e1b5/2" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is the sql fiddle link with example.</p>  <p>Code for someone who does not want to use sqlfiddle (for whatever reason):</p>  <pre><code>create table testcsv(   csvnumber varchar2(100)   );  INSERT ALL   INTO testcsv VALUES ('one')   INTO testcsv VALUES ('three')   INTO testcsv VALUES ('five')   INTO testcsv VALUES ('six')   INTO testcsv VALUES ('seven') SELECT * FROM dual;  select csvnumber from testcsv where csvnumber IN('one', 'two','three', 'four'); </code></pre>  <p>P.S: actual scenario is obviously much complex, I have simplified it to get the idea.</p>
