<p>I'm trying to open Oracle database in nomount mode but no matter what I do it just not startup. </p>  <p>I also echo oracle sid, home, base and they all are correct. I think it doesn't see sqlplus or some environment variable. I can certainly start it manually.</p>  <p>Does anybody can think of any more variables? or how to debug this?</p>  <p>Below script works and output is from the original script where many other function gets call, please ignore spelling mistake as this is manually typed here.</p>  <pre><code>test_login.ksh  #!/bin/ksh  SID=testdb  changeEnv {   export ORACLE_SID=$SID   export ORAENV_ASK=NO   . oraenv    echo "SID after change is $ORACLE_SID" }  startupNoMount {   echo "Current sid: $ORACLE_SID"   nomount=`sqlplus -s "/as sysdba" &lt;&lt;EOF   STARTUP NOMOUNT; EOF`     echo "value for startup: $startupNoMount" }  echo "script start"  echo "call changeENV" changeENV  echo "call startupNomount" startupNoMount  *** Output     SID after change is testdb      Current sid: testdb     Value for startup: &lt;empty&gt; </code></pre>
