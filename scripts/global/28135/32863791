<p>I have Oracle 11g Database. When I execute query with WITH CLAUSE it doesn't show any result.</p>  <p>here is the query.</p>  <pre><code>WITH seq AS (SELECT to_char(LEVEL) p FROM dual CONNECT BY LEVEL &lt;= 10) SELECT old_value, new_value FROM (SELECT to_char(t1.p) old_value, to_char(t2.p) new_value FROM (SELECT row_number() over(ORDER BY p) rn, p FROM seq) t1, (SELECT row_number() over(ORDER BY dbms_random.random) rn, p FROM seq) t2 WHERE t1.rn = t2.rn); </code></pre>  <p>When I execute this query it shows no record. 0 rows selected in 0.0078 seconds.</p>  <p>Is there any way to solve this query?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance. :)</p>
