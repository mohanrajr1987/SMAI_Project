<p>I am getting the following error when I try to execute the below code.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>ORA-19011: Character string buffer too small</p> </blockquote>  <pre><code>SELECT   filecontent             FROM       (SELECT  XMLTYPE(REGEXP_REPLACE(filecontent, '&lt;Transaction .*&gt;', '&lt;Transaction&gt;')) filecontent        FROM example_table where somecondition = true)        ) xmlContent </code></pre>  <p>filecontent is a column whose type is XMLTYPE. We are storing a XML file in this column. </p>  <p>This error occurs if the xml file contents is > 4000 characters. If any of the the xml file has &lt; 4000 characters this error doesn't occur.  We are in Oracle 11G. So as per the documentation we should be able to store 4GB of content in the <em>filecontent</em> column. I am thinking the problem is REGEXP_REPLACE function which tries to read the file contents where we are facing this issue with the buffer. I may be wrong. Any help in this regard is much appreciated.</p>
