<p>I have a list of IDs that I want to check if they are in the <code>employee</code> table. I want to display only those that are not in the table.</p>  <pre><code>SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE; EMPLOYEEID|FIRSTNAME|LASTNAME 1         | JOHN    | DOE 2         | JANE    | DOE </code></pre>  <p>When I run the sql statement below I am hoping to get the IDs not present in employee table.</p>  <pre><code>SELECT '1', '2, '3', '4' AS "X1"FROM  EMPLOYEE WHERE X1 NOT IN (SELECT EMPLOYEEID FROM EMPLOYEE); </code></pre>
