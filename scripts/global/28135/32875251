<p>I'm running into an issue with the below query. I found out how make the query work but I am still wondering why this ORA-01732. Below is the query that gives the error. The <code>CheckDate</code> function returns a date. If I <code>to_date</code> or <code>substring</code>  the denial date where it is <code>bolded</code> the query works. If I don't I get the error ORA-01732: data manipulation operation not legal on this view. Does anyone know why it is saying I can't update a view when there is no view and why just by putting a <code>to_date</code> or <code>substring</code> it fixes the error?</p>  <pre><code>DELETE FROM INPUT_STAGING I  WHERE ( I.STATUS_IND = 'N' AND (SUBSTR(I.PAYMENT_STATUS,1,1) = 'T'     OR (NVL(TRIM(I.DENIAL_DT), '00000000') &lt;&gt; '00000000'              AND codeowner.CheckDate(***I.DENIAL_DT***) &lt; to_date('10/01/2014', 'MM/DD/YYYY'))) ); </code></pre>
