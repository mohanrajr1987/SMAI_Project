<p>I created this topic as I could not find the answer even though there are many similar threads.</p>  <p>Recently many users reported that the tool created in Visual Studio stopped working. This is a WPF application written in C# and its purpose is to pick up Excel spreadsheets and export them to Oracle database for further calculations. </p>  <p>The application crashes when it attempts to create a class <code>OracleBulkCopy</code> which is a member of <code>Oracle.DataAccess</code> library (it is added to the project as Reference). The project was distributed among users as installation package and the idea was that they do not need to install anything else. </p>  <p>Currently I am investigating this issue on 3 machines:</p>  <ul> <li>1 - my regular laptop</li> <li>2 - virtual machine set up on my laptop</li> <li>3 - old laptop delivered by my colleague</li> </ul>  <p>It works well only on machine no 3 which has reinstalled Windows 7 64-bit and Oracle Client 11g (Oracle.DataAccess version 2.112.2.0). The other two also run on Windows 7 64-bit, we performed tests on various Oracle libraries. Machine number 1 is a bit messy as I removed or reinstalled many versions of DataAccess and in GAC they are all visible. I tried to setup machine no 2 (virtual machine, also fresh Windows 7) the same way as machine no 3 but the application still crashes.</p>  <p>Here is the error message and my findings after browsing some forums and StackOverflow questions.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Uarxh.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Uarxh.jpg" alt="&lt;photo1&gt;"></a></p>  <ol> <li>I found some information about <code>InnerException</code> which I caught with try...catch. The description is as below:</li> </ol>  <blockquote>   <p>Inner Exception</p>      <p>Step into: Stepping over property 'System.Exception.get_InnerException'.

I checked PATH system variables for each machine and they clearly point the right paths.</p>  <ol start="2"> <li><p>GAC looks different in 3 cases. Laptop 1 shows total mess â€“ as I mentioned earlier result of numerous re-installations. Laptop 3 (the old one which works fine) shows just 1 entry for Oracle.DataAcces and 2 Policy records. Laptop no 2 also shows the same libraries as laptop 3 but it does not work. I wanted to edit GAC lists but unfortunately due to lack of admin rights I am not able to do that either manually or with <code>Gacutil.exe</code>. If this may fix the problem the only option is to install the package with correct libraries.</p></li> <li><p>I also found a tutorial which suggests unloading the project and editing <code>csproj</code>. I corrected some values but this also did not bring the expected result.</p></li> <li><p>One discussion mentioned that faulty class may have static constructors but <code>OracleBulkCopy</code> does not have any static elements.</p></li> </ol>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ICUhF.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ICUhF.jpg" alt="OracleBulkCopy class"></a></p>  <p>I am running out of ideas how this can be fixed. Have someone of you faced similar issue and managed overcome the problem? </p>
