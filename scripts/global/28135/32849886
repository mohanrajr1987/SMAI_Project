<p>I am trying to put two values together as one with two cursors. I need to put a code with a plan, for each code and each plan.</p>  <pre><code>declare external_code varchar2(100); internal_code varchar2(100); internal_group varchar2(100);  cursor codes is select code from codes_table where code in ('371', '373', '376', '378', '391', '393', '396', '398');  cursor plan_codes is select distinct plan from plans_table where code = '378'; --This will grab all the plans that I need.  begin for code1 in codes loop     external_code := code1.code;     for plans in plan_codes loop     external_code := external_code || ' ' || plans.plan;     dbms_output.put_line(external_code);     end loop; end loop; end; </code></pre>  <p>My desired output should look like this:</p>  <pre><code>371 FB 371 FC 371 FD 371 FF 371 FG 373 FB 373 FC 373 FD 373 FF 373 FG </code></pre>  <p>etc etc and through the list. The trouble I'm running in to (which is probably something simple) is the inner loop is running wild (like it should) and appending each of the plans on one line like this:</p>  <pre><code>371 FB 371 FB FC 371 FB FC FD 371 FB FC FD FF </code></pre>  <p>I have toyed with <code>continues</code> and <code>exits</code> but I can't seem to get it quite right. </p>
