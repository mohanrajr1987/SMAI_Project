<p>I need to do a work for my university and I choose to do it using the Go language. Yesterday I installed the .msi and setted the variables to:</p>  <ul> <li>GOPATH = <code>C:\Users\Gustavo\goprojects</code> (this is the folder that I want to place all my Go projects)</li> <li>GOROOT = <code>C:\Go\</code></li> <li>PATH = <code>C:\Users\Gustavo\goprojects\bin</code></li> </ul>  <p>After this, I installed the GoClipse plugin on my Eclipse and created a new project into the <code>goprojects</code> folder. Then, I created another folder in the <code>src</code> folder, and a .go file into this folder.</p>  <p>Now is my problem. When I started to write some code, everytime that I try to auto complete my code, Eclipse shows me an error and I was searching on google and found that I need to install one project from GitHub called <code>gocode</code>. </p>  <p>So I want to know where do I need to install it and how can I import it to my project.</p>  <p>P.S.: I am using Windows 8.1, I have git installed and the link of <code>gocode</code> project is: <a href="https://github.com/nsf/gocode" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/nsf/gocode</a></p>
