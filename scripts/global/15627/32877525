<p>I recently started learning GoLang. There have been multiple instances where the compiler throws an error when I try to pass variables as arguments inside Go functions. I've been able to debug this sometimes by using a pointer in front of the variable. Both &amp;, and * pointers seem to clear the error. Though, I'd like to understand why. I'm wondering what the difference between &amp;, and * is, and when each should be used. Thank you!</p>  <pre><code>func (ctx *NewContext) SendNotification(rw http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request, p httprouter.Params) {      decoder := json.NewDecoder(req.Body)      var u User      if err := decoder.Decode(&amp;u); err != nil {         http.Error(rw, "could not decode request", http.StatusBadRequest)         return     } } </code></pre>
