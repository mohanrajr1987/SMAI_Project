<p>I'm trying to use SWIG to create a Go wrapper for a C++ API that uses <code>std::istream</code> to read binary data. I'd like to be able to pass an <code>io.Reader</code> to these APIs, but I'm not sure how to create a mapping between it and <code>std::istream</code>. I know I need to implement a <code>std::streambuf</code> subclass and I assume the rest will involve directors and typemaps, but I'm not familiar enough with SWIG to figure out the right combination.</p>  <p>Any ideas?</p>
