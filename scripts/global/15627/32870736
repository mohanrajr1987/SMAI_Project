<p>I'm a newbie to the go world, so maybe this is obvious.</p>  <p>I have a Go function which I'm exposing to C with the <code>go build -buildmode=c-shared</code> and corresponding <code>//export funcName</code> comment. (You can see it here: <a href="https://github.com/udl/bmatch/blob/master/ext/levenshtein.go#L42" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/udl/bmatch/blob/master/ext/levenshtein.go#L42</a>)</p>  <p>My conversion currently works like this:</p>  <pre><code>func distance(s1in, s2in *C.char) int {     s1 := C.GoString(s1in)     s2 := C.GoString(s2in) </code></pre>  <p>How would I handle UTF-8 input here? I've seen there is a UTF-8 package but I don't quite get how it works. <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/unicode/utf8/" rel="nofollow">https://golang.org/pkg/unicode/utf8/</a></p>  <p>Thank you!</p>
