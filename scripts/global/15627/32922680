<p>I'm learning to use <code>martini</code> framework and find it easy to use.</p>  <p>But I don't know how to organize my codes as MVC.</p>  <p>In martini I write <code>m.Get('/foo', bar)</code> and then implement the <code>bar</code> function in the same file. It's impossible to do like this in a large project,so I try to create a <code>Wrap(function_name string) func</code> which returns a function to handle the request.But this work is hard because I need to load many packages which implement my functions in <code>Wrap</code>.</p>  <p>So is there any ideas to solve this problem or are there any existing packages in <code>github</code> which have resolved my problem?</p>  <p>Is there any recommended articles to read about go web?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
