<p>I want to implement a program that provides interactive-shell like experience with CLI.<br> I have been trying <a href="https://github.com/bobappleyard/readline" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/bobappleyard/readline</a> but it needs users to install <code>GNU readline</code> and it causes some bugs in OSX.  </p>  <p>Is there any other solution implemented in go without <code>cgo</code> so users do not need to install <code>GNU readline</code> additionally?</p>
