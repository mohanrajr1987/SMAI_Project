<p>There was this chat application I saw one or two months ago and I remember that it used Go in the back end and ReactJS and Flux in front end. It was a threaded live chat web application that used different colors for users in the threads.</p>  <p>I don't remember the name of this chat application and I have used hours to look for it.</p>  <p>Does anyone know the name of the chat application?</p>
