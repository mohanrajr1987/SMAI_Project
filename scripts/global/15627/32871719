<p>I'm pretty new to Go, and I'd like to make this snippet into a function. </p>  <p>Basically, I would like to know if there is a possible way to pass a variable name into a function call so if I called:  </p>  <p><code>changeColor(varName) </code></p>  <p>It would run, and then assign a new value to the original variable, which was inputted into the function call.  </p>  <p>Hopefully this makes sense, and thanks in advance</p>  <pre><code>if varName == yellow {     varName = black } else {     varName = yellow } </code></pre>
