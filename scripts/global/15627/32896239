<p>I am trying to write two micro-services.  One is in Nodejs and faces the web, the other is in Go and talks only to the other service.  I basically have a <code>socket.write(JSON.stringify({hello:true});</code> on the node side and that is then received in the Go service, which errors at <code>json.Unmarshal(message, myStruct)</code>, where say <code>myStruct</code> is:</p>  <pre><code>type Something struct {     Hello bool `json:"hello"` } myStruct := &amp;Something{} </code></pre>  <p>and the error tells me I can't marshal a type string into a type bool.  Why would Go's json lib not be able to figure out that {hello: true} can be / is a bool?</p>
