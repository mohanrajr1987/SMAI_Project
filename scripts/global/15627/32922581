<p>Can <a href="https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin" rel="nofollow">gin</a> describe route like django?</p>  <p>In all examples, the routers are in one place, never found about attachment.</p>  <p>I would like to describe the routes in the package, and in the main file is simply to write something like. example:</p>  <pre><code>r := gin.New() r.Include("/main", here_imported_route.Route) </code></pre>  <h1>here_imported_route.go</h1>  <pre><code>package here_imported_route  Router := gin.New() Router.Use(midl()) Router.Get("/test", hello) </code></pre>  <p>and then on "/main/test" we get "hello".</p>
