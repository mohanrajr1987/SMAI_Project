<p>I am looking for a simple way to merge a .reg file into the registry as part of my automated script in Python 2.7. I am rather lost on this issue and haven't found very much useful information. </p>  <p>I can do this via a batch file, but when I call that batch via python, no changes are made to the registry.</p>  <p>Any advice on how I might do this within Python would be greatly appreciated.</p>
