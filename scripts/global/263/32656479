<p>I have an <code>install.reg</code> file for an application, I want to match the keys and if it already exists, it should go to <code>backup.reg</code> file.  How to do that that ? Can I use <code>reg.exe</code> in someway as I don't want to write java/c# code for this. </p>  <p>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00</p>  <pre><code>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SAM\samplekey] "newkey"="newvalue"  [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SAM\samplekey2] "key"="value2" </code></pre>  <p>matching a very big sets of registries can be very costly. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2006/02/22/536920.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2006/02/22/536920.aspx</a></p>
