<p>I've legacy 32-bit COM component (Basically DLL) which has a dependency on <em>msvbvm50.dll</em> (In-build COM component in 32 bit windows). Now, I want to use this DLL in my code/application hosted on 64-bit windows 7.</p>  <p>As described in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3439845/register-32-bit-com-dll-to-64-bit-windows-7">this</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4798560/32-and-64-bit-interoperability-on-64-bit-windows">this</a>, I tried using 32-bit tools (<em>c:\windows\syswow64\regsvr32.exe</em>) to register them to registry. I also made sure the entry exist in registry (using <em>syswow64\regedit32.exe</em>) at <strong>HKey_Classes_Root\Wow6432Node\CLSID[GUID]</strong> with AppID registered with DLL GUID and DLLSurrogate is enabled at <strong>HKey_Classes_Root\Wow6432Node\AppID[GUID]</strong> </p>  <p>However, The problem is - Whenever I try to use this component in my VBScript as </p>  <p><em>SET variable = CreateObject(DLLComponent.DLLObject)</em></p>  <p>My <em>'variable'</em> value always comes as empty. Just to confirm, when try to locate the component using Process explorer, I couldn't find any of the DLLHost process running this component which suspect me that it is not loaded at first place.</p>  <p>Can anyone suggest where i'm going wrong? What additional steps i can perform to get this working or debugging for root cause?</p>  <p>FYI - </p>  <p>My Classic ASP application (Which is using VSScript to load this COM component) is hosted on IIS 7 in 64-bit Windows 7 Machine.</p>
