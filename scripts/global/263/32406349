<p>I'm trying to add a wide character string to registry in C++. The problem is that the <code>RegSetValueEx()</code> function does not support wide chars, it only supports <code>BYTE</code> type (<code>BYTE</code> = <code>unsigned char</code>).</p>  <pre><code>WCHAR myPath[] = "C:\\éâäà\\éâäà.exe" RegSetValueExA(HKEY_CURRENT_USER, "MyProgram", 0, REG_SZ, myPath, sizeof(myPath)); // error: cannot convert argument 5 from WCHAR* to BYTE* </code></pre>  <p>And please don't tell me I should convert <code>WCHAR</code> to <code>BYTE</code> because characters such as <code>é</code> and <code>â</code> can't be stored as 8 bit characters.</p>  <p>I'm sure this is possible because I tried opening <code>regedit</code> and adding a new key with value <code>C:\\éâäà\\éâäà.exe</code> and it worked. I wonder how other programs can add themselves to startup on a Russian or Chinese computer.</p>  <p>Is there another way to do so? Or is there a way to format wide character path using wildcards?</p>  <p><strong>Edit:</strong> The Unicode version of the function <code>RegSetValueExW()</code> only changes the type of the second argument. At least google the function before downvoting!</p>
