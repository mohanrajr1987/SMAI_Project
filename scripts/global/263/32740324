<p>I'm loading a third party DLL that reads some of its own settings from HKCU, and I want to change its behaviour by altering a couple of values that it reads.</p>  <p>Assuming that it only reads when it is first loaded, I could write the changed values to the registry, then load the DLL then change the values back again. But for a brief period of time this would also affect any other process that might load the same DLL.</p>  <p>Is there a way to alter the value that it will read within just my own process?</p>
