<p>I'm learning how Windows 7 starts and I try to make sure that bootmgr do not uses ntfs for its purposes (to search winload.exe file for example).</p>  <p>While I have a little knowledge to analyze the code of bootmgr, I'm trying to determine when the driver ntfs.sys is loading.</p>  <p>For this purpose, I'm looking into the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\Ntfs key, there is Group key with value "Boot File System", then I'm looking for this key into the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\GroupOrderList key.</p>  <p>But there is no "Boot File System" key (but I found mention of it in subkeys of HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SafeBoot key). </p>  <p>I'm looking into the List key in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\ServiceGroupOrder key and there is this key is present.</p>  <p>Also I run Sysinternals LoadOrder utility to see it, but there is no mention of ntfs driver in general, but there is mention of fs_rec key in "File System" group, but in registry there is no "File System" group in GroupOrderList (but I found it in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem key).</p>  <p>Obviously, it's more hard to understand.</p>  <p>–ùow can I make the right conclusions to determine when the ntfs.sys driver is loading or where can I read about it?</p>
