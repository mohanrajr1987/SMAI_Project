<p>I would like to add an argument to all chrome shortcuts in windows. For example , I want the user to always start chrome using this path : </p>  <p>"C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe"  --kiosk</p>  <p>I have been able to change the shortcut on the desktop using a VBscript but the part related to the quick launch bar did not work. I thought that It could be possible to achieve the same result using the registry or a batch file. Would you suggest the best way to reach this goal.</p>
