<p>I have vba code inside an Excel that is reading registry keys. Since a Windows update I can't read anymore some registry keys (like HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.pdf). I get an error in Dutch saying : The registry key can't be read (kan registersleutel HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT.pdf niet openen om deze te lezen | Run-time error -2147024894 (80070002)). The key still exists. Do you now need more permissions to read this key ? I am using Office 2013 (32-bit) This is the code I am using:</p>  <pre><code>'54 Checking if a Registry key exists: 'returns True if the registry key i_RegKey was found 'and False if not  Function RegKeyExists(i_RegKey As String) As Boolean     Dim myWS As Object    Dim oShell As Object     On Error GoTo ErrorHandler    'access Windows scripting    Set myWS = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")     'try to read the registry key    myWS.RegRead i_RegKey    'key was found    RegKeyExists = True    Set myWS = Nothing    Exit Function  ErrorHandler:     'key was not found    RegKeyExists = False    Dim sError As String    sError = Err.Description    Debug.Print sError  End Function </code></pre>
