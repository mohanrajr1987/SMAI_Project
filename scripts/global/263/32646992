<p>I am trying to import/merge registry file "silently" (without UAC pop up) using VB.NET but I am having problem importing the registry file. I am using following code:</p>  <pre><code>Process.Start("regedit.exe", "C:\Users\ThisPC\Desktop\u001.reg") </code></pre>  <p>It works but the process is not silent. Tried this too: <code>"C:\Users\ThisPC\Desktop\u001.reg /s"</code> but no success, pops up "disk or file system error" and finally, the registry importing fails, values/keys not added. How can I fix this problem? <br>One more question, how can I "export" this registry key <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\u001</code> to a "u001.reg" file using VB.NET? <br>(I am using VS 2010 on Windows 7 x64)</p>
