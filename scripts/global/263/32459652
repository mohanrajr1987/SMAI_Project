<p>i need help with Wordpress. </p>  <p>I have 5 custom posts- news, products, services etc. I made them and all works fine, also made special categories for each of them(using taxonomy). </p>  <p>I want to make 3 roles:</p>  <ul> <li>Editor - adds, accept and edits his and others posts</li> <li>Author - Adds and edits only his posts</li> <li>SubAuthor - Add and edits only his posts but needs acceptance</li> </ul>  <p>Okay still good, no problem, some googoling and i can do it. BUT I need to make Users with one of this roles and attache him(ascribe-google translate) to 1-n Custom posts</p>  <p>Examples User1 - Author - news and products User2 - Editor - all User3 - Editor - only products</p>  <p>Also this must like this:</p>  <ol> <li>Administrator goes to panel and goes adding user</li> <li>He choose role, custom posts and paste e-mail</li> <li>E-mail with link goes to user</li> <li>He register using this link</li> <li>User made</li> </ol>  <p>How can i do it? I found literally nothing how can i do this. I'm new to WP but i worked on CodeIgniter. Any clues, ideas or something?</p>
