<p>I've modified my C# application name by right clicking on project -> Application -> Assembly information -> Title.</p>  <p>If the application is already installed then it is not updating the name because it is pulling the application name from MUICache which is not getting refreshed.</p>  <p>I'm trying to find out a way where I can make MUICache get invalidated programmatically so that it will update the application name appropriately.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
