<p>I configured a proxy in our local Sonatype Nexus 2.11 to install npm packages. It works but not always. I couldn't figure the differences out, but when I install a package, sometimes it goes through my .npmrc registry (<a href="http://lpmpa-des13:8081/content/groups/npm-all/" rel="nofollow">http://lpmpa-des13:8081/content/groups/npm-all/</a>) and some other times I install some other packages, it goes through the original registry. For example, npm install -g cordova -dd, installs over the intended registry (local)... but, immediately after that, npm install -g ionic -dd, starts downloading packages from local registry and then moves to original one. I put the logs in those link: ioninc: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B68L4S_JroYwYlFqYjB1Wkx0Yms/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B68L4S_JroYwYlFqYjB1Wkx0Yms/view?usp=sharing</a> cordova: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B68L4S_JroYwVlRGSUNJSURYdFE/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B68L4S_JroYwVlRGSUNJSURYdFE/view?usp=sharing</a></p>
