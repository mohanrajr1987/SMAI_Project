<p>I already have the registry key to disable tablet mode, but if I restart it puts it back into tablet mode unless I change "sign in" to "Remember what I last used". Here is a picture of what I am talking about.</p>  <p><a href="http://i1379.photobucket.com/albums/ah134/fac7orx2/tablet%20mode%20last%20used22_zpsinqpghnl.png" rel="nofollow">http://i1379.photobucket.com/albums/ah134/fac7orx2/tablet%20mode%20last%20used22_zpsinqpghnl.png</a></p>  <p>I need to do this for an installer, so I want to change the registry key for "sign in" to "Remember what I last used". Thanks.</p>
