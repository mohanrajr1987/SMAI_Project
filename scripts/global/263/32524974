<p>I have an application which when I install in Windows 10, need to show up in left navigation pane. Now, I checked how other applications like OneDrive, DropBox which when installed in Windows 10, show up in the navigation pane. Apparently, it was mentioned that there is a DWORD value in registry which controls this behavior which is System.IsPinnedToNameSpaceTree. This value should be set to 1. But, when I tried to create this value in registry manually for my application's registry entries, it did not work for me. I am kind of stuck here. So, can somebody please help me in this regard ? </p>
