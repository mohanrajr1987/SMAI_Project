<p>At office, I use an over-ten-years-old ERP program. The program has a critical bug which leaks memory and resource, especially, GDI object. Because of the GDI leak, I couldn't use the program more than 3 hours at once. Therefore, two months ago, I increased the GDI limit by changing the value of below item from 10000 to 32767.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows   NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\GDIProcessHandleQuota”</p> </blockquote>  <p>It worked well, so I did not suffer from app crash for a few weeks. However, It suddenly became useless. Now the ERP program often crashes again. I realized it crashes after occupy 10001 GDIs by checking task manager. Why? The registry value is still 32767. Why does the app crash as soon as exactly 10001 GDI occupation? I don’t know what I did nothing for my computer except Windows update. Not only me, the whole company workers suffer from the same problem. </p>  <p>In short, even though the registry of <strong>GDIProcessHandleQuota is 32767</strong>, a process now can hold up to 10000 GDI objects. <strong>As soon as the process holds 10001 GDI, it crashes.</strong> Help me!!</p>
