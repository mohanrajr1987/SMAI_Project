<p>I usually use an IDE whenever I write my own code. I don't know very much about make, configure scripts, etc.</p>  <p>I'm working on a large and complicated existing project now, and the steps to build are:</p>  <pre><code>./autogen.sh ./configure make </code></pre>  <p>I wrote my own C files and added them to Makefile.am. I then repeat this process to build.</p>  <p>Everything is fine, except for one thing. I want to build without any compiler options like -Wall. I was told that using CFLAGS like this would give me what I want:</p>  <pre><code>./configure CFLAGS=-O0 </code></pre>  <p>It doesn't seem to work, because the compiler still uses the -Wall option. I can manually remove all occurances of -Wall from the CFLAGS="..." in the configure script. This is annoying but it works. But then when I execute </p>  <pre><code>./autogen.sh </code></pre>  <p>The configure script is reset with all of the -Walls (and other CLFAGS I don't want) back in their original places. (I'm not sure but I think I have to run autogen.sh every time I add new files to Makefile.am.)</p>  <p>Is there a better way deal with this?</p>
