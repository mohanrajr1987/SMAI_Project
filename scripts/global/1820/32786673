<p>I'm echoing the time before I run a task and the time that task ends: <code> test:     @echo $(shell date)     @JUNIT_REPORT_PATH=test/report.xml ./node_modules/.bin/mocha test/integration     @echo $(shell date) </code> Is there a way to store the dates in 2 variables and then show the elapsed time between them? I assume it would look something like this:</p>  <pre><code>test:     $begin = $(shell date)     &lt;do stuff&gt;     $end = $(shell date)     @echo $end - $begin </code></pre>  <p>Any pointers to good documentation on Make would be appreciated too.</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
