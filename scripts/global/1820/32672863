<p>My Makefile optionally receives a command line parameter called <code>COMPILE</code> which I want to override on the Makefile script itself.  </p>  <p>According to <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Override-Directive.html" rel="nofollow">this</a>, I've tried: <code>override COMPILE=gcc</code>.<br> However, <code>COMPILE</code> is used in the condition of an <code>ifeq</code> and setting <code>COMPILE</code> this way does not affect the first Make pass when conditionals are evaluated.</p>  <pre><code>override COMPILE=gcc   ifeq ($(COMPILE), gcc)     ... I never get here... else     ... Always here ... endif </code></pre>  <p>Is there a way to properly override a Make parameter which is used in conditionals?</p>
