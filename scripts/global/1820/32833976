<p>I have just started work on a project with some typescript code, and I'm trying to compile the .ts files to .js files from within Linux Mint, but it's not working as I'd expect.</p>  <p>There is a Makefile, but it's not working. Running <code>make</code> returns an error:</p>  <pre><code>tsc --noImplicitAny --noEmitOnError --out client/welcome.js client/welcome.ts make: *** [client/welcome.js] Error 1 </code></pre>  <p>I have also tried creating an example typescript file greeter.ts (as per <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/Tutorial" rel="nofollow">this official tutorial</a>) containing:</p>  <pre><code>function greeter(person) {     return "Hello, " + person; } var user = "Jane User"; document.body.innerHTML = greeter(user); </code></pre>  <p>and tried compiling the ts file to javascript with the command (as per the same tutorial) <code>tsc greeter.ts</code> however the command completes with no output, and no .js file has been created.</p>  <p>I haven't previously worked with typescript at all, and though I've used Makefile's before I don't know much about them either, so I'm hoping it's something really obvious!</p>
