<p>I am using <strong>nmake</strong> to compile a makefile.msc file</p>  <p>I have to include the below directories</p>  <pre><code>c:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.1\Include\um C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.1\Include\shared C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.1\Include\winrt </code></pre>  <p>in the /I atrribute of the RCFLAGS</p>  <p>What I have tried are below :</p>  <p>1st try:</p>  <pre><code>RCFLAGS  = /I "c:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.1\Include\um" /I "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.1\Include\shared" /I "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.1\Include\winrt" </code></pre>  <p>2nd try:</p>  <pre><code>RCPATH  = "'c:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.1\Include\um':'C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.1\Include\shared':'C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.1\Include\winrt'"  RCFLAGS = /I $(RCPATH) </code></pre>  <p>Everytime, RC complaints about different missing headers.</p>  <p>Please give a guideline on how to achieve what I am trying to do. Many thanks in advance.</p>  <p>Edit : Many resources elaborate how to do this with CFLAGS but are not specific about RCFLAGS. Moreover, there is little help if I do a <code>rc /?</code>.</p>
