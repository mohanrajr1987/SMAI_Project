<p>I got a advice on code review to use <code>-M</code> options family with <code>gcc</code> to generate auto dependency generation the problem is that the documentation is confusing me and I still dont understand how am I supposed to use it when I simply added -M to CFLAGS the and still I could barely find any difference I just got the <code>warning: main.o: linker input file unused because linking not done</code> I am using <code>gcc 4.8.4</code></p>
