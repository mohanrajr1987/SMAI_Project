<p>Below is the snippet of my script, which calls the make (GNU), trying to set VERSION env variable before calling <code>make</code></p>  <pre><code>#!/bin/bash set -e MY_VERSION="VERSION=1.0.0"  function build_target() {    echo ${MY_VERSION} make    ${MY_VERSION} make    VERSION=1.0.0 make #this works when I comment out above line. } build_target </code></pre>  <p>it fails with error</p>  <p><code>VERSION=1.0.0 make ./test.sh: line 7: VERSION=1.0.0: command not found</code></p>  <p>as mentioned in the code, when I comment out line 7, line 8 works good, why is not taking the value expanded from the variable?</p>
