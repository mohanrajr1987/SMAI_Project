<p>I am supposed to build existing Windows 32bit project for Windows 64bit. (and probably linux 64bit too).</p>  <p>The project uses <code>log4cplus</code> library. That one only contains 32bit .lib files at the moment and is shining example of why I hate using libraries in C++ - there's just a bunch of source files and linux bash scripts. The <code>INSTALL</code> help file is entirely about the <code>configure</code> bash script which doesn't work on Windows. The <code>configure</code> probably just passes some arguments to GCC, but I don't known which ones.</p>  <p>I downloaded MinGW in hope I'll be able to use <code>mingw32-make</code> on the project and it will work, but no such thing happened.</p>  <p>So does anyone have any experience making those Linux projects on Windows? This is not the first time I tackle this problem - my third most viewed question is about <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/15398392/607407">broken Boost build</a>. Judging from the view count, I'm not the only one who has problems building Linux project on widnows.</p>
