<p>How this simple <code>make</code> script knows that some of cpp files is changed? Does it means that for each .o file it will look for corresponding .cpp one? What if extension will be different - for example <code>.c</code></p>  <pre><code>hellomake: hellomake.o hellofunc.o      gcc -o hellomake hellomake.o hellofunc.o -I. </code></pre>  <p>UPD: According to my understanding scrip I provide should not look to c and cpp files. And when I asked to build project second time <code>MAKE</code> told me "make: 'hellomake' is up to date.  But I was surprised when I have changed <code>hellomake.cpp</code> MAKE has decided do rebuild project. Why?</p>
