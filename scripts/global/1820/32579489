<p>I am using the source file from <a href="https://github.com/contiki-os/contiki" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/contiki-os/contiki</a> I added a new directory (say <code>/foo</code>) that includes some .c and .h files</p>  <p>I need to use them on <code>examples/cc26xx</code> , although I included the .h files (under <code>/foo</code>) to cc26xx-demo.c, it doesn't really include the files when I run <code>make</code></p>  <p>can anyone tell me how do I need to include them either on <a href="https://github.com/contiki-os/contiki/blob/master/examples/cc26xx/Makefile" rel="nofollow">examples/cc26xx/Makefile</a> or <a href="https://github.com/contiki-os/contiki/blob/master/Makefile.include" rel="nofollow">Makefile.include</a></p>
