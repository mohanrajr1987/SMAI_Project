<p>When using the source code, you can use the command <code>git describe</code> to get the current version number.</p>  <p>When using the binary, I added an option that allows users to pass in the <code>--version</code> flag to get that current version number:</p>  <pre><code>if (argc &gt;= 2) {     if (argv[1] == "--version") {         cout &lt;&lt; "eval version v0.1-16-g74a9332";     } } </code></pre>  <p>The problem is, that value <code>v0.1-16-g74a9332</code> is now hardcoded into my source. If I go off and change something somewhere else, I will have to increment this value every time I commit (which is just asking for merge conflicts!)</p>  <p>Moreover, the part <code>g74a9332</code> is the hash of the current commit. If I change this value in the source code, the hash of the commit changes.</p>  <p>Is there any way for me to, rather than hardcode the version number into the code, have c++ "know" the version number is <code>v0.1-16-g74a9332</code> when it compiles the binary?</p>
