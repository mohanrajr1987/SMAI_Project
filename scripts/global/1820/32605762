<p>What is the simplest way to make sure that </p>  <pre><code>make target </code></pre>  <p>does not run concurrently ? If two process run <code>make target</code> at the same time, both would run the target and will likely step on each other toes. </p>  <p>A shell snippet such as</p>  <pre><code>dotlockfile target.lock || exit 1 trap "dotlockfile -u target.lock" EXIT make target </code></pre>  <p>works well: if two process run that snippet at the same time, one of them will acquire the lock and the other will wait for it to finish. When the first process completes, the other get to run <code>make target</code> which will return immediately and do nothing because the target has already been built. </p>  <p>I'm hoping there is a simpler way to do the same thing.</p>
