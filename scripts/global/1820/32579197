<p>I'm trying to install <a href="https://github.com/cisco/openh264#for-ios-builds" rel="nofollow">openH264 for ios</a>. Here are the steps I run from the openH264's current directory using terminal:</p>  <pre><code>$ make OS=ios ARCH=armv7 </code></pre>  <p>The default location of openh264 installation was set <code>/usr/local</code> in the <em>makefile</em>. So, I just ran the following command</p>  <pre><code>$make install </code></pre>  <p>But I got this error: </p>  <pre><code>nasm -DUNIX64 -DPREFIX -f macho64 -Icodec/common/x86/   -o codec/encoder/core/x86/coeff.o codec/encoder/core/x86/coeff.asm nasm: fatal: unrecognised output format `macho64' - use -hf for a list type `nasm -h' for help make: *** [codec/encoder/core/x86/coeff.o] Error 1 </code></pre>  <p>I am following <a href="https://trac.pjsip.org/repos/ticket/1758" rel="nofollow">this</a> instructions also to build the codec. Besides after successful installation I have to include it into <a href="https://trac.pjsip.org/repos/wiki/Getting-Started/iPhone#VideoSupport" rel="nofollow">pjsip for video support</a>. I don't know what is the problem with the command? Thanks in advance.</p>
