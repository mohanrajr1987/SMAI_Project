<p>Halo, I tried to install <strong>libiconv</strong> with this tutorial <a href="http://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/mingw_how_to.html#libiconv" rel="nofollow">http://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/mingw_how_to.html#libiconv</a>. I installed <strong>MinGW</strong> from heise.de, containing <strong>MSYS</strong>. In MSYS I made the steps <em>./configure</em> and <em>make</em>. Step <em>make install</em> finishes with an error: </p>  <pre><code>libtool:install: /bin/install -c -m 644 .libs/../bin/libiconv-2.dll /usr/local/lib/../bin/libiconv-2.dll     /bin/install: cannot stat .libs/../bin/libiconv-2.dll: No such file or directory make install error Leaving directory c/libiconv-1.14/lib </code></pre>  <p>To solve this problem, I copied <strong>libiconv-2.dll</strong> from <em>C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\local\bin</em> to <em>C:\libiconv-1.14\bin</em>. It was proposed in <a href="https://linuxacademy.com/blog/linux/troubleshooting-configure-make-and-make-install-tutorial/" rel="nofollow">https://linuxacademy.com/blog/linux/troubleshooting-configure-make-and-make-install-tutorial/</a> in section <strong>make install problems</strong>.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The package you just compiled doesnâ€™t have the install target. In this   case you will have to copy the compiled binaries to a bin directory   yourself.</p> </blockquote>  <p>As I compiled with <strong>MSYS</strong>, I had the binaries under <em>C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\local\bin</em>.</p>  <p>The path to <strong>libiconv-2.dll</strong>   -  <em>.libs/../bin/libiconv-2.dll</em>   -   is right, if current directory is <em>c/libiconv-1.14/lib</em>.</p>  <p>Does anyone know why <strong>libiconv-2.dll</strong> can't be found? Everything seems to be ok.</p>  <p><strong>update:</strong> I don't try to install libiconv anymore!!!</p>
