<p>I ran across this error while trying to compile the NMR software modelfree4.20 for Linux. The distribution comes with a MakeFile, and so I type "make" in the modelfree folder to try and compile it, and after it writes a few files I get the following error:</p>  <pre><code>/usr/bin/ld: -f may not be used without -shared collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status Makefile:74: recipe for target 'modelfree4' failed make: *** [modelfree4] Error 1 </code></pre>  <p>I have no idea what "-f may not be used without -shared" means or what it is trying to tell me to fix? I don't see anything with a -f or -shared in the MakeFile when I open it up, and I didn't specify any options when I ran "make."</p>  <p>Any help on this is greatly appreciated!</p>
