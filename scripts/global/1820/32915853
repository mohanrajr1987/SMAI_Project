<p>So, I'm trying to build something in make. I produced the files via cmake, went to the appropriate folder for the build file, and:</p>  <pre><code>make Scanning dependencies of target Spenvis [ 33%] Building CXX object source/CMakeFiles/Spenvis.dir/pySpenvisCSV.cc.o [ 66%] Building CXX object source/CMakeFiles/Spenvis.dir/SpenvisCSV.cc.o [100%] Building CXX object source/CMakeFiles/Spenvis.dir/SpenvisCSVCollection.cc.o Linking CXX shared library libSpenvis.so /usr/bin/ld: /usr/local/lib64/libpython2.7.a(abstract.o): relocation R_X86_64_32 against `.rodata.str1.8' can not be used when making a shared  object; recompile with -fPIC /usr/local/lib64/libpython2.7.a: could not read symbols: Bad value collect2: ld returned 1 exit status make[2]: *** [source/libSpenvis.so] Error 1 make[1]: *** [source/CMakeFiles/Spenvis.dir/all] Error 2 make: *** [all] Error 2 </code></pre>  <p>I'm a bit of a novice as far as make/cmake goes. I'm uncertain where to go from here. I've looked at several suggestions, but I'm uncertain which are relevant to my particular problem and how to implement the suggested fixes in the first place.</p>  <p>Halp!</p>
