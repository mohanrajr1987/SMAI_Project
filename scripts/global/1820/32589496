<p>I recently installed MinGW and learnt how to use Make. But I get an error whenever I try to compile a CPP source file using make. Below is the output:</p>  <pre><code>MAKE Version 3.6  Copyright (c) 1991 Borland International  Available memory 33397872 bytes          mingw32-g++ main.cpp --std=c++11 -o program Bad command or file name </code></pre>  <p>The main.cpp is a very simple "Hello World" type program. The command works when I use it in the Command Prompt directly.<br> I am running Windows 8.1 with MinGW. GCC version 4.8</p>
