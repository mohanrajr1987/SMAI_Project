<p>I'm beginning with command line building of my libraries. I'm used to use IDEs on Windows.</p>  <p>I want to use MSYS Bash to call build tools to build my libraries in C. Say I have 100 of distinct libraries which have no relation to each other and many are built for different platforms. What is the easiest way to build them?</p>  <p>I use Windows and MSYS Bash but preferably the approach should be platform agnostic. The naive and time consuming way would be start bash, cd to my library folder, set PATH variable to point to actual build tools to be used (in my case GCC ARM, MinGW, ...) and call make. And then again for each library.</p>  <p>I would prefere just to click/call something which has already defined the folder where the library resides and build tools to be used. Is it possible?</p>
