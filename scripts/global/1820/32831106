<p>I installed gcc 5.2 with gmp, mpfr and mpc, plus the isl and cloog optimizations, works perfectly. All prefixes are in <code>/usr/local</code> so that I have to <code>sudo</code>my <code>make install</code>'s. I had to redo the same install on the computer of a friend, and now, I have to do it on another computer of mine... It's enough, so that I wrote a script. (And broke my "script whatever you have to do twice" rule.) My problem is that at some places of the script I have <code>sudo make install</code> commands, and that I don't want to run my script as admin.</p>  <p>How could I modify my script so that the following happens : before each <code>sudo make install</code> command one is asked to elevate permissions, and if one accepts, one is asked the root password, and then, <code>sudo make install</code> is executed, and after, the next commands are executed with "normal" permissions, until the next <code>sudo make install</code>, etc... ?</p>  <p>(I tagged make but the question is of course independant of it.)</p>
