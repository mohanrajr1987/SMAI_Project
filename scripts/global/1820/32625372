<p><code>make</code> is really good at creating files that are needed by definition of rules, but how can one easily <strong>remove</strong> files that do not belong? For example, imagine a target <code>foo</code> that creates the files <code>bar</code> and <code>baz</code> in the directory <code>build</code>. The target <code>foo</code> will define how to create the two files <code>bar</code> and <code>baz</code>, but what if there is an other file <code>bleh</code> already in <code>build</code>? Is there a way to tell make to remove files that don't belong there?</p>  <p>I'm not looking for the obvious 'call <code>make clean</code>' then solution.</p>
