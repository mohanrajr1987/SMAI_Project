<p>I'm tired of manually executing one command after another just to compile a C++11 program that makes use of CGAL.</p>  <p>So I thought I'd create a small .sh file that would take care of it for me:</p>  <pre><code>#!/bin/bash  cgal_create_cmake_script &amp;&amp; cmake . &amp;&amp; echo "set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS \"${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -std=c++11\")" &gt;&gt; CMakeList.txt &amp;&amp; make </code></pre>  <p>I don't really know much about bash scripts, but this <em>seems</em> to work well enough. However, I'm constantly getting warnings that </p>  <blockquote>   <p>make: Warning: File 'Makefile' has modification time 2.4 s in the future</p>      <p>make[1]: Warning: File 'CMakeFiles/Makefile2' has modification time 2.4 s in the future</p>      <p>make[2]: Warning: File 'CMakeFiles/my_dir.dir/progress.make' has modification time 2.4 s in the future</p> </blockquote>  <p>Now, as much as I'd like a computer capable of predicting the future, I'm not really happy about this. What am I doing wrong?</p>
