<p>I understand that DropCreateDatabaseIfModelChanges will trigger the rebuild of my database when the model changes.  And this is what I've experienced for the last two weeks I've been working on this project.  I change the model, delete the MDF, and rerun the project.  When I forget to delete the MDF, upon accessing the controller, the exception reminds me that the entity framework cannot recreate the database since it already exists.  This reminds me to delete the MDF, and all is well again.</p>  <p>At some point today, things changed.  Now, it attempts to recreate the database every time I run the project.<br> Here's what I've done to validate I'm having a new problem...</p>  <p>I delete the MDF to start fresh. Run the project, hit the controller, which creates the MDF, then stop the project.<br> I then immediate run the project again... no code changes whatsoever. I get the "Additional information: Cannot create file '....mdf' because it already exists. Change the file path or the file name, and retry the operation." (removed the actual mdf file name here for brevity).</p>  <p>I don't understand why it keeps trying to recreate the DB even when no model changes have occurred.  Any ideas what's going on?  I've restarted VS and Windows, but to no avail.  I'd sure appreciate any ideas/suggestions on what to check next.</p>
