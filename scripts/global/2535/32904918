<p>I have a DB with no constraints (given, not changeable). My model look like</p>  <pre><code>public MyModel  {      public long Id { get; set; }      // Even if database column 'Value' could be NULL,     // the model - from business view - could not.     public long Value { get; set; } } </code></pre>  <p>My data I'd like to read is</p>  <pre><code>Id Value 1  1 2  2 3  NULL 4  4 </code></pre>  <p>When I read with with DBContext.MyModel.ToList() it fails, of course. Is there any possibility to catch the error on 3rd row and return the 3 valid ones?</p>  <p>I don't dependent on EF but I like an automatic mapping between DB an Code.</p>  <p><strong>Update:</strong>  It seems I wasn't specific enough. I need the 3 rows AS WELL AS a notification for the error. </p>  <p>Additional I've created a simple case for demo. In real life I have around 800 tables with up to 250 columns. I can't catch anything by model modification like dates out of range, missing relationships and other stuff.</p>  <p>What I really need is a try..catch for every row or an event on row reading failure, something like this.</p>
