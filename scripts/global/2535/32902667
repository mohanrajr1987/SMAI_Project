<p>Can i ask if this is the correct way to delete the whole database table using EF?  Department table joins Facility with DepartmentID, Facility table joins Facility Reservation with FacilityID, I need to delete all the record from Facility Reservation table. Can someone please guide me and tell me if this is correct? Thank you!</p>  <pre><code>    db.Database.ExecuteSqlCommand(                     "DELETE FacilityReservation FROM Department INNER JOIN Facility ON Department.DepartmentID = Facility.DepartmentID " +                         "INNER JOIN FacilityReservation ON Facility.FacilityID = FacilityReservation.FacilityID WHERE Department.DepartmentID =" + departmentID); </code></pre>
