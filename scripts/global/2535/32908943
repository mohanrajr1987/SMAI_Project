<p>I am relatively new to MVC, and I'm a little stuck....</p>  <p>I have 2 Models:</p>  <p>The Site model -</p>  <pre><code>SiteID() As Integer Name() As String Latitude() As Double Longitude() As Double </code></pre>  <p>And the Device model -</p>  <pre><code>DeviceID() As Integer Make() As String Model() As String Serial() As String Site() As Site </code></pre>  <p>As you can see, a Device is linked to a Site.  What I'm trying to do is in the Device views for Create and Edit, make it so the Site field is a <code>DropDownListFor</code>, whose list contains the Sites that exist in the Site table.</p>  <p>So this is what I put in the View for creating the list that will be in the drop down:</p>  <pre><code>@ModelType TestWebApplication2.Device @Code     ViewData("Title") = "Create"      Dim selectSite As List(Of SelectListItem)     Dim listOfSites As IEnumerable(Of TestWebApplication2.Site)      For Each item In listOfSites         selectSite.Add(New SelectListItem() With {.Value = item.SiteID, .Text = item.Name})     Next  End Code </code></pre>  <p>The problem is, in the line </p>  <blockquote>   <p>For Each item In listOfSites</p> </blockquote>  <p>I get a green squiggly under <code>listOfSites</code>, and it says "Variable 'listOfSites' is used before it has been assigned a value. A null reference exception could result at runtime."</p>  <p>I can see my tables in the context just fine:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/oAyCz.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/oAyCz.png" alt="Application DB Context"></a></p>  <p>And I was guessing it should be done this way since <code>IEnumerable(Of TestWebApplication2.Site)</code> is the model type for the Index view, which can loop through <code>For Each</code> just fine.</p>  <p>So what am I missing regarding the listOfSites??</p>  <p>Thank you very much!</p>
