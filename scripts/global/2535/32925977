<p>I have a class</p>  <pre><code>public partial class Score {     public Score()     {         GameLogs = new HashSet&lt;GameLog&gt;();     }      public int id { get; set; }      [Column("score")]     public int score1 { get; set; }      [StringLength(50)]     public string name { get; set; }      public virtual ICollection&lt;GameLog&gt; GameLogs { get; set; } } </code></pre>  <p>that was generated from my database after creating the table with </p>  <pre><code>CREATE TABLE Scores ( id int IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,                   score int NOT NULL,                       name VARCHAR (50)                      ) </code></pre>  <p>I have since, however, run the query </p>  <pre><code>ALTER TABLE Scores ADD playdate DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;  </code></pre>  <p>and I'm trying to figure out how to update the above model accordingly. You can see that class <a href="https://github.com/jamkin/Snake/blob/master/SnakeGame/Migrations/Score.cs" rel="nofollow">here</a>. It's in the Migrations folder and I can't figure out a way to update it through a wizard. I've tried looking at instructions like <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/cc716705(v=vs.100).aspx" rel="nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/cc716705(v=vs.100).aspx</a> but the entire structure of the project in examples like that seems different than what I have ... </p>
