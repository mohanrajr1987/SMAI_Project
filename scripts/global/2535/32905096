<p>I am developing a plugin in C# for another application. The parent application already uses Entity Framework 6.0.0 with the SQL Server Compact edition provider which are defined in the App.config. In my plugin, I want to use Entity Framework and SQL Server, but I have no control over the App.Config file in the parent application.</p>  <p>When attempting to connect to the database from my plugin I receive the error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>No Entity Framework provider found for the ADO.NET provider with   invariant name ‘System.Data.SqlClient’. Make sure the provider is   registered in the ‘entityFramework’ section of the application config   file.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I found the following link on MSDN explains how to achieve code based configuration:</p>  <p><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/jj680699" rel="nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/jj680699</a></p>  <p>It would appear that the DbConfiguration option is not applicable in my case as the documentation states that only one configuration class can be defined which specifies app-domain wide settings.</p>  <p>The other code first options from the MSDN link do not appear to be applicable either (For example, setting the configuration explicitly or overriding the DbConfiguration) as the parent application will have already configured and used the Entity Framework before my plugin gets called.</p>  <p>My question is:</p>  <p>Given that one Entity Framework configuration is already present and in use, is it possible to set an additional configuration for Entity Framework within the same App Domain?</p>
