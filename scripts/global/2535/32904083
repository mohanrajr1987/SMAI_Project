<p>I have a big EDMX with about 50 entities. It has been mapped since the start with the update model from db wizard.</p>  <p>For more readability, I separated the entities on multiple diagram. All works well, the EDMX "compile" successfuly.</p>  <p>However, since this visual structure change, the update model from db wizard don't create new entities by itself anymore. The new table is visible in the table store but not matching entitiy has been created as it used to.</p>  <p>My questions is : </p>  <ul> <li>Is it normal behavior ? (I think not, but in comparaison with other VS oddities, it wouldn't supprise me ...)</li> <li>It there a way to correct this ?</li> <li>If not, is there a way to automaticly create an entity from a store table</li> </ul>
