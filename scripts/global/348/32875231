<p>Hello I am losing my mind trying to get this to work. I essentially have a button that will loop a sound. The problem is that if I use MediaPlayers setLooping() method, there is a noticeable gap in between the loop.  </p>  <p>Using this link: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20054684/how-to-achieve-gapless-audio-playback-between-looping-on-android#_=_">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20054684/how-to-achieve-gapless-audio-playback-between-looping-on-android#<em>=</em></a></p>  <p>I was able to achieve a seamless loop once but it will not repeat. This is my code</p>  <pre><code>            nextMp = MediaPlayer.create(this, R.raw.arabic_night);             mp = MediaPlayer.create(this, R.raw.arabic_night);              play = (Button) findViewById(R.id.button);             play.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {                 @Override                 public void onClick(View v) {                     mp.start();                     mp.setNextMediaPlayer(nextMp); </code></pre>  <p>Does anybody have any suggestions or logic I could use to alternate between the two MediaPlayers indefinitely so that I can achieve a seamless and continuous loop? Thanks.</p>
