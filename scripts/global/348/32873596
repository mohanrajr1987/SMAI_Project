<p>The remote device is sending live raw PCM audio(no header included) in UDP packets and I need to implement a program in java to receive these packets and play them on the PC live. As I know that raw PCM's attributes are 16bit, mono, sampling rate 24KHz, so I tried to add a wav header to this raw PCM audio and play but the problem is I don't have File size of the audio.</p>  <p>I also implemented a program based on <a href="http://www.wikijava.org/wiki/Play_a_wave_sound_in_Java" rel="nofollow">this link</a> but it only gives noise in output.</p>  <p>I am bound to use UDP and I can get only raw PCM from remote device, so is their any library or API by which I can play this raw audio on PC?</p>
