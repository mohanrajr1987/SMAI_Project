<p>I have to migrate a legacy project from Windows Media to HTML5 video/audio. The system should provide video/audio content to the web user meeting following criteria:  </p>  <ol> <li>Playout: Segments (TcIn to TcOut) of large video/audio files should be played "on the fly" to the web user. (Cutting the source material into segments does not work because there is a high overlap rate between segments, so 3-4 times more HDD space and a lot of extra programming would be needed. Markered playout of the large source files is not an option either as there are forbidden parts of the source material which should never be available to the user).</li> <li>Cutting: In general, users are permitted to make copies of the material. Indeed, by using the dowload function, users can download selected segments. I guess, this is not a problem: a service starts a cutting software (probably ffmpeg) that cuts the video, and the user is notified by email to download the product. (That's the way I do it now but there might be a more simple option).</li> <li>Formats: what is the preferred video/audio format that most browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Android) support?</li> <li>Server: If possible, I would keep Windows Server because the database behind is MS SQL Server.  </li> </ol>  <p>(Windows Media Server and WMEncoder currently works fine for all the above, however WM is not suppored by browsers any more. That is the reason for reengineering).  </p>  <p>I would appreciate any of your suggestions on how to rebuild this video/audio system. (What software elements to use and how).  </p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
