<p>Normally we didn't have any API that lets us to intercept (and change or not) the AudioQueue's pcm data. So we had to somewhat delay the audio by first sending it to audio conversion APIs... That doesn't work meaningfully for streaming audio apps.</p>  <p>With all the latest additions to iOS, I couldn't figure out if it is directly possible to be able to reach/change decoded PCM data right before the device plays it from AudioQueue.</p>  <p>AAC audio --> (pushed to Audio Queue buffers) --> [Our man in the middle receives decoded data and if it has nothing to do passes it again without touching anything] --> AudioQueue plays the buffer through speaker.</p>  <p>I know that AudioUnits may be the way to go, but for now, I have to stay with AudioQueue.</p>  <p>Is there a way to do this easily with the latest iOS SDK? Like audio taps, etc?</p>
