<p>I'm making a game using Java2D for my graphics class project.<br> Using javafx.scene.media.AudioClip to play simple sounds like blasts, etc.<br> After inserting a time altering property (like max payne, hehe) i used <strong>audioClip.setRate()</strong> to slow it down.<br> The setRate() method did slow down the playback,but now the clip keeps <strong>looping</strong> endlessly. And each time i try to use the same instance of the audioClip, a new loping instance starts. Can't seem to figure out why.</p>  <p>Any ideas how to stop this looping?</p>  <p>Edit: Just to add that the javafx MediaPlayer.setRate() is working properly, but the AudioClip.setRate() isn't.</p>
