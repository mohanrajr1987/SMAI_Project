<p><strong>Setting the scene:</strong></p>  <p>I have a room - room has an ID.</p>  <p>I can add objects to the room - object has an ID, a state (on/off) and a sound effect.</p>  <p>I can add as many objects to the room as I like and objects can be deleted again.</p>  <p>I also have a controlpanel - it contains buttons.</p>  <p>For each object in the room there is an "on/off"-button in the controlpanel. - All buttons have the same class.</p>  <p>Buttons have an onclick event.</p>  <p>When clicked they change the state of the object and play/stop the sound effect.</p>  <p><strong>Question / case:</strong></p>  <p>If I have one room with two objects and I press button1 - obj1 is on and sound1 is playing.</p>  <p>If I press button2 - obj2 is on and a sound2 is playing.</p>  <p>If I press button1 again - obj1 is off and sound1 stops - but sound2 continues until I press button2 again.</p>  <p><strong>The code so far:</strong></p>  <p>This code works with only one object - but the problem is, use the same onclick event for all buttons and I only create the audio object when state == "off".</p>  <p>I wish I could name the audio objects something like: sound+roomID+itemID - but even by setting the variable as a property of an object didn't work.</p>  <pre><code>$(document).on("click",".btnOnOff", function(){         // LOCALSTORAGE STRING IS CONVERTET TO JSON         var localJSON = convertToJSON();          // GET IDS         var roomID = $(this).attr("data-roomID");         var itemID = $(this).attr("data-id");          // GET POSITIONS         var roomArrPos;         for(var i = 0; i &lt; localJSON.users[userID].house.rooms.length; i++ ){             if(localJSON.users[userID].house.rooms[i].id == roomID) {                 roomArrPos = i;             }         }         var arrPos = itemID - 1;          // GET NEEDED DATA         var currentState = localJSON.users[userID].house.rooms[roomArrPos].utilities[arrPos].state;         var sound = localJSON.users[userID].house.rooms[roomArrPos].utilities[arrPos].sound;           if (currentState == "off") {             currentState = "on";             localJSON.users[userID].house.rooms[roomArrPos].utilities[arrPos].state = "on";              audio = new Audio('sound/'+sound+'.mp3');             audio.play();          } else {             currentState = "off";             localJSON.users[userID].house.rooms[roomArrPos].utilities[arrPos].state = "off";              audio.pause();             audio.currentTime = 0;         }          // UPDATE LOCALSTORAGE WITH THE CHANGES TO STATE         updateHouseToLocal(localJSON);   }); </code></pre>
