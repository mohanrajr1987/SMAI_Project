<p>I am quite new to Matlab and I am trying to make a program where there are 3 push buttons.</p>  <p>Question 1:</p>  <p>Button 1 will be linked to an audio file (.wav) So when I press it, Button 1 will "select" the first audio file.</p>  <p>Button 2 will be linked to another audio file (.wav) So when I press it, Button 2 will "select" the second audio file.</p>  <p>Then, I need to press Button 3 to play the sound file selected, based on which button I pushed first(Button 1/Button 2)</p>  <p>So my current code is like this:<br> <strong>Button 1 and 2:</strong></p>  <pre><code>[FileName,PathName] = uigetfile({'*.wav'},'Load Wav File'); [x,Fs] = wavread([PathName '/' FileName]); </code></pre>  <p><strong>Button 3:</strong></p>  <pre><code>player = audioplayer(x,Fs); play(player); </code></pre>  <p>Ok, so my first problem is that when I run this code, I have to manually select the file. I am not too sure how to make it already link to the file, so I need help on that part...</p>  <p>My second problem is actually about the audioplayer... For Button 3, it is actually not working... and no sound is played out. I tried <code>sound (x,Fs)</code> before but I search online and they say I have to manually give the command clear sound to stop the .wav file from continuing.</p>  <p>How do is solve this problem? Because I think if I use a fourth button with the code:</p>  <pre><code>stop(player) </code></pre>  <p>it gives me an error.</p>
