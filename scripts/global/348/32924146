<p>Good afternoon!</p>  <p>I am trying to play 3 audios width android but not at the same time, my code is the next one:</p>  <pre><code>                for (Word w : wordsList){                     String path = Parameters.PATH_AUDIO + "/" + w.getAudioPath();                     Uri audioPath = Uri.parse(path);                     MediaPlayer audio1 = MediaPlayer.create(context, audioPath);                     audio1.start();                 } </code></pre>  <p>But all audios start to play at least at the same time. I need something like audio1.wait() or audio1.sleep or someone like this.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
