<p>I'm trying to <strong>display</strong> a waveform ( i recorded my self in the <strong>microphone</strong>).</p>  <p>The keep the data in a <strong>byte</strong> array.</p>  <p>In addition my sample rate is 44100 and the sample size is <strong>16bit</strong>.</p>  <p>My array contains only positive values, but in some examples i saw that the values are between <em>-1.0 to 1.0</em>. Why is that? In addition, If my sample size is 16 bit and i'm using a byte array - i need to make a conversion.  This is what i tried to do so far:</p>  <pre><code>    double[] x = new double[Arc.Buffer.Count / 2];     byte[] y = new byte[2];                  for (i = 0; i &lt; Arc.Buffer.Count; i++)                 {                     Array.Copy(Arc.Buffer.ToArray(), 2*i, y, 0, 2);                     x[i] = (double)((y[1] &lt;&lt; 8) | (y[0] &amp; 0x00FF));                 }                 </code></pre>  <p>But after this code, my x array contain huge values (and not -1.0 to 1.0).</p>  <p>I'm new in this subject and i will appreciate any help!
