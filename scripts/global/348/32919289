<p>I've made a method to play sounds in mp3 format (max file size 145kb). When an event happens in the game I just send the file to this method. It creates a new mediaplayer instance whenever it is called, then releases that instance on completion.  My problem is that with both the emulator and my phone, when I play 2 sounds near simultaneously, the sounds either skip (like a scratched CD), or one sound doesn't play at all, or sometimes it actually works.</p>  <p>Is a thread getting overloaded or something? I have a Samsung galaxy s3. Should I use soundpool instead? I've heard it has its own problems</p>  <pre><code>public class MediaSimultaneous {  private MediaPlayer[] mediaPlayerArray = new MediaPlayer[10]; private AudioManager mAudioManager; int playerNum = -1; // Array index of the player instance.  public void playSound(Context context, int audioId) {     if (mAudioManager == null) {         mAudioManager = (AudioManager) context.getSystemService(Context.AUDIO_SERVICE);     }         playerNum += 1;         mediaPlayerArray[playerNum] = MediaPlayer.create(context, audioId);          mediaPlayerArray[playerNum].setOnPreparedListener(new MediaPlayer.OnPreparedListener() {              @Override             public void onPrepared(MediaPlayer mp) {                 mp.start();                 mp.setOnCompletionListener(new MediaPlayer.OnCompletionListener() {                      @Override                     public void onCompletion(MediaPlayer mp) {                          mp.release();                         mediaPlayerArray[playerNum] = null;                         playerNum -= 1;                          if (playerNum &lt;= 0) {                             playerNum = 0;                          }                     }                 });             }         });  } </code></pre>
