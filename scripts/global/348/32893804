<p>I am developing an app to do live video streaming and when I recently upgraded to an iPhone 6s, all noise going through the microphone sounds robotic (or like a cricket). I can reproduce this issue only using the skype app, but no other app have this similar output. The skype support forums say that this is a problem they're seeing on iPhone 6s [1] but don't give any details as to what's causing it. </p>  <p>The interesting thing is it doesn't have issues when I use the microphone jack via my headphones, only when the built in microphone is used. Is there a permission or a change I need to make to my app to fix this?</p>  <p>[1] - <a href="http://community.skype.com/t5/iOS-iPhone-and-iPad/iPhone-6s-Distorted-sound/td-p/4138308" rel="nofollow">http://community.skype.com/t5/iOS-iPhone-and-iPad/iPhone-6s-Distorted-sound/td-p/4138308</a></p>
