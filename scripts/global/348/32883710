<p>As is demonstrated in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/32879428/3681880">this answer</a>, I have recently learned how to play audio files using both <code>AVAudioPlayer</code> and <code>AudioToolbox</code>. I have successfully played a single audio test file using both methods. However, I want to ask about which one I should actually use in my app (or if it even matters). </p>  <p>Here are the relevant characteristics of my app:</p>  <ul> <li>There are about 800 audio clips.</li> <li>Most of the clips last less than one second.</li> <li>Any could be chosen to be played at random by the user, but only a small subset will be used on any particular run.</li> <li>No special volume control or playback options are needed.</li> </ul>  <p>These are my questions:</p>  <ul> <li>Which method for playing a sound would be better? Why?</li> <li>Should I preload the sounds or just load them when they are needed? I'm guessing that preloading 800 sounds every time is a bad idea. But if I wait to load them until they are needed, I am worried about performance (ie, a noticeable pause before the clip is played)</li> <li>Do I need to play sounds on a background thread?</li> </ul>  <p>So my concerns in choosing which audio player to go with are memory and performance. I couldn't tell from any of the documentation that I saw which is better in this case.</p>
