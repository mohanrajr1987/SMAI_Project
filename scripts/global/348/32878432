<p>I'm working on an iOS app which uses the IMAAdsManager to display Ads served by the IMA sdk.</p>  <p>When we increase the roundtrip latency using Charles Proxy, the Audio Ads timeout and return a failure/error. The app is designed to handle this event, however when this happens other audio in the app fails to play successfully from there-on until the app is restarted.</p>  <p>The weird part is, when I plug in the headphones into the jack, audio continues to play fine. So the audio is working, just not being expelled through the usual route.</p>  <p>Has anyone had enough experience with the IMA sdk to know whether my hypothesis is valid, or how to handle the audio problem resulting from the failure?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
