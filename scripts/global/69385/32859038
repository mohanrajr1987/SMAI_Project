<p>I have a <code>List&lt;Item&gt;</code> collection. I need to convert it into <code>Map&lt;Integer, Item&gt;</code> The key of the map must be the index of the item in the collection. I can not figure it out how to do this with streams. Something like:</p>  <pre><code>items.stream().collect(Collectors.toMap(...)); </code></pre>  <p>Any help?</p>  <p>As this question is identified as possible duplicate I need to add that my concrete problem was - how to get the position of the item in the list and put it as a key value</p>
