<p>Given a Clock, an Instant and the current Thread, is there already some (utility) method in the Java libraries that makes the current thread sleep until the given clock reaches the instant?</p>  <p>Something like</p>  <pre><code>public static void sleepUntil(Instant instant, Clock clock)   throws InterruptedException; </code></pre>  <p>?</p>  <p>I need this in a test setting where I am working with a custom slowed-down clock.</p>  <p>I know that it is easy to implement, but I would prefer a standard solution if available (but didn't find it so far).</p>
