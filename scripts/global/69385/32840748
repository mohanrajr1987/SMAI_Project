<p>Is there any seamless mechanism for executing restful requests from Akka (using akka with java only). There is a spray client <a href="http://spray.io/documentation/1.2.3/spray-client/" rel="nofollow">http://spray.io/documentation/1.2.3/spray-client/</a> but it seams there is no api for java nor ssl support.<br> Also there is Akka-Http package but is still experimental and I could not find a description of the client api.</p>  <p>So far I have one approach to use jersey client (<a href="https://jersey.java.net" rel="nofollow">https://jersey.java.net</a>) and hide synchronous calls behind an Akka router with some pool of actors doing this job.</p>  <p>Any other suggestions? </p>
