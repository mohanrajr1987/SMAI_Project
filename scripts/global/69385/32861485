<p>I want to parse some text into a date. However, there is no guarantee that the text has the desired format. It may be <code>2012-12-12</code> or <code>2012</code> or even <code></code>.</p>  <p>Currently, I am down the path to nested try-catch blocks, but that's not a good direction (I suppose).</p>  <pre><code>LocalDate parse; try {     parse = LocalDate.parse(record, DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("uuuu/MM/dd")); } catch (DateTimeParseException e) {     try {         Year year = Year.parse(record);         parse = LocalDate.from(year.atDay(1));     } catch (DateTimeParseException e2) {         try {               // and so on          } catch (DateTimeParseException e3) {}     } } </code></pre>  <p>What's an elegant solution to this problem? Is it possible to use <code>Optional</code>s which is absent in case a exception happened during evaluation? If yes, how?</p>
