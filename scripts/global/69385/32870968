<p>I'm having trouble finding in the documentation for Wildfly how to get Tapestry to redirect to my Index.tml page. This file is located in the root of my war file. However, when I try to access my localhost I get a blank page that only says "Not Found".</p>  <p>Has anyone run into a similar problem when switching from Tomcat to Wildfly and how did you get around this? Thanks!</p>
