<p>I am starting mobile app development this year and will be developing for the Android OS using Eclipse Juno</p>  <p>I am just setting up my environment at the moment and was watching some tutorials on plural sight and one of them was advising that you will run into problems with JDK 7, however we are now at JDK 8 as the video is slightly outdated and I'm wondering is this resolved with JDK 8 now being released or do I revert to 6?</p>  <p>If the answer is revert to 6 then can I install it also, or do i remove 8 and install 6?</p>  <p>Thank you </p>
