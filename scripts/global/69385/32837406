<p>I have a timestamp as ms and format this with a SimpleDateFormater like this:</p>  <pre><code>SimpleDateFormat sdfDate = new SimpleDateFormat("MM/d/yyyy h:mm a");  return sdfDate.format(new Date(timeStamp)); </code></pre>  <p>Now I'd like to change this to use the new Java 8 abilities. Seems like I really can't find a way to get this working with the new Java 8 Classes. Anyone got a hint?</p>
