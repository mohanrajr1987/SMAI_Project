<p>In CKEditor (v4.5), suppose the user enters data such as:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;strong&gt;Testing&lt;/strong&gt; </code></pre>  <p>into the editor and  the same is saved into the DB.</p>  <p>On reading and displaying the data, it is coming out to be:</p>  <p><strong>Testing</strong></p>  <p>How can this be prevented?</p>  <p>In other words, is it expected behaviour for the code to get converted like this? If so, how can code be inserted?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance...</p>
