<p>I created a little module in Drupal 7 to use a custom config file for CK editor. This works, because I can adapt the UI Color or can activate SCAYT and edit some options imn SCAYT.</p>  <p>So I think this custom config file is working OK.  But now I tried to do saomething with the plugIns in the install folder of CK ... But it seems that these are not active or not loaded.  Is there any difference between assemble a ck editor via CK Builder and download the plugins manually and activate the plugins via </p>  <p>config.ExtraPlugin = 'floating-tools';</p>  <p>I have the expierence, that a lot of plugins, which I download are not active  ....</p>  <p>Why there is no visible control in settings dependig plugins???? How to check if a plugin is loaded. Is there any thing to do after some configuration in custom config file was made so the changings take effect?</p>
