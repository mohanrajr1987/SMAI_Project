<p>I'm trying to add my own fonts to CKEditor 4. But I also want to keep the installed default fonts. The code I've found online is:</p>  <pre><code>config.font_names = "MyNewFont," + config.font_names; </code></pre>  <p>But this results in just showing MyNewFont and removing all the other fonts. I've checked via <code>console.dir( config )</code> and <code>console.log( config.font_names );</code> and discovered that <code>font_names</code> is <code>undefined</code>. But the default fonts all show up if I remove my line, so it's getting it from somewhere. </p>  <p>What's the proper way to add my font in CKEditor 4?</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong> It appears that the <code>font_names</code> property is being set very late in the process, during plugin loading. If I set it before that, then it uses only the one font I added. If I set it after (i.e. <code>editor.on( "pluginsLoaded",...);</code> ) then it's too late. The only solution I was able to find was to edit the font plugin's <code>plugin.js</code> file to add my font into their list.</p>
