<p>This might sound like a stupid question. I have a Zend Framework 2 Form. One of my Form Elements is a textarea with the attribute required. I now implemented CKEditor for that field, but my required is lost and all I can do is Server Validation.</p>  <p>I have looked through the web and the documentation of CKEditor, but I can not find a solution for the problem. Anyone got a hint how to solve this?</p>  <p>Thank you in advance.</p>
