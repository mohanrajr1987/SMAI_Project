<p>I am currently working on the ckeditor for a project, We are using the link dialog plugin.</p>  <p>As said in the title I wish to make new links, and set the caret at the end of it. The default behaviour selects the text in the editor once you add a new link.</p>  <p>I've been working around with the link.js plugin </p>  <p>I think I located where it happen, but I am not able to set my caret after the end of my a tag in all case (It works sometimes=> it places the caret at the end, but after some tries it does put it at the begining of my link)</p>  <p>Here is a sample of what it does :  first time : [a href="#"]my link[/a]^ after some tries : [a href="#"]my link[/a][a href="#"]my link[/a]^[a href="#"]my link[/a]</p>  <p>the code inside the onOk method of the link plugin:</p>  <pre><code>//I've commented the line under to have no selection : it works //range.select(); // According to the doc, this should do the job ?? range.moveToPosition(text, CKEDITOR.POSITION_AFTER_END); </code></pre>  <p>Thank you for your attention.</p>  <p>Dre.</p>
