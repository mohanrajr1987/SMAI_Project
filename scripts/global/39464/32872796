<p>Im using Laravel 5 with CKEditor and <a href="https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-elfinder" rel="nofollow">Elfinder</a> to create a WYSIWYG editor in a CMS. Ive got the file browser up and running, but i cant get the file upload to work. I have the upload tab, but when I click Send to Server I get the following:</p>  <pre><code>TokenMismatchException in VerifyCsrfToken.php line 46: </code></pre>  <p>Any ideas why this is happening?</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>  <p>I removed verifyCsrf from Kernel.php which removed that error specifically. It did, throw a new exception, but I'll save that for a future question. Ultimately, I dont want to disable csrf across the board just for image uploads. So I thought I could exclude the routes:</p>  <p><strong>/app/Http/Middleware/VerifyCsrfToken.php:</strong></p>  <pre><code>class VerifyCsrfToken extends BaseVerifier {      /**      * The URIs that should be excluded from CSRF verification.      *      * @var array      */     protected $except = [         'elfinder/*'     ]; </code></pre>  <p>I am assuming all elfinder routes run under a elfinder prefix, although I don't have any evidence to back this up. The documentation is not too clear on the routes that run during upload. Welp....this doesn't work either. </p>  <p>So a followup: Is this the right direction? Anyone know the exact routes that get run on Elfinder?</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE 2</strong></p>  <p>Using this <a href="https://laracasts.com/discuss/channels/general-discussion/l5-disable-csrf-middleware-on-certain-routes" rel="nofollow">article</a> I created my own VerifyCsrfTokenCustom class and was able to disable CSRF on Elfinder only. There seems to be a routing issue for a get/post route, but I think that should be a new question.</p>
