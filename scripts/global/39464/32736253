<p>I'm working in a IE9 Update Versions: 9.0.41 iframe.Since the update from 9.0.4 to 9.0.41 the toolbar appears grey and the buttons do not work.</p>  <p>When debugging following error is thrown as soon as i click into the Textfield of the CK-Editor:</p>  <pre><code>ckeditor.js:   SCRIPT5007: Unable to get value of the 'specified' property: the object is null or undefined. </code></pre>  <p>The following line of code is producing that error:</p>  <pre><code>return this.$.attributes.getNamedItem("contentEditable").specified?this.$.getAttribute("contentEditable"):null </code></pre>  <p>According to my debugger the length of attributes is 0 therefore I am assuming there is no item named "contentEditable" in it. There were no changes performed. On Update Version 9.0.4 CK-Editor works just fine.</p>  <p>Has somebody faced similar problems, or can help me to fix this issue?</p>  <p>Sincerly, Alex</p>
