<p>I have been looking for a way to disallow either h tags to be indented into ul/ol elements or p elements already in ul/ol to be made into h elements. After going though the docs and forums I cant find any way to do this without writing a specific plugin. I would have assumed that the 'Advanced Content Filter' would have some way to achieve this behavior but after much experimentation I couldn't figure it out. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
