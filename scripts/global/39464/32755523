<p>I want to integrate spellchecker functionality for ckeditor. ckeditor's inbuilt wsc plugin shows advertisement in popup so I cant use it.  After that I tried my luck with nanospell which needs to install java-php bridge in case of java server which after lots of trials I could not install.  Then I tried with javascriptspellchecker which claims to be supported on java server on their website,but when I ran its <a href="http://localhost:8080/JavaScriptSpellCheck/02-TestInstall.html" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8080/JavaScriptSpellCheck/02-TestInstall.html</a> I got 'No working server technology found! You will need to deploy this solution on a server that supports ASP, ASP.Net or PHP' this message under 'Running Test' section. So my questions are: 1.Solution to any of the above 2 problems 2.Any alternative I can use apart from these two.(Speckie is not supported for our server).</p>
