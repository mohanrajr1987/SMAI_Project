<p>I have a page with 2 tabs on it (using bootstrap's <code>.tab-nav</code>). In one tab, inside an update panel, I have a CKEditor 4.x instance. In the other tab, I have a button that pushes a CSV file via HttpResponse (initiates a download). This download button triggers a full postback since partial postbacks can't push streams for download.</p>  <p>The problem is that after I initiate the download, when I switch back to the tab with the CKEditor instance, it's vanished. </p>  <p>Any ideas how to fix? I <em>suspect</em> it is directly related to the fact that I'm hacking the HttpResponse from the server to deliver the download, but why would the CKE instance disappear?</p>
