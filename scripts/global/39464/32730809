<p>I am trying to use allowedContent in the main config file to allow the inclusion of the class attribute for divs when in source editor mode.</p>  <p>I have tried </p>  <pre><code>config.allowedContent='div[class]'; </code></pre>  <p>And for some this has the effect of removing some but not all of the toolbar options and also does not allow the inclusion of the class attribute.</p>  <p>There are no errors found on the debug inspector.</p>  <p>If I do </p>  <pre><code>config.allowedContent=true; </code></pre>  <p>This works as expected but I don't want to allow all content.</p>  <p>The toolbar options left are, full screen, source and format. That is from a custom selection.</p>
