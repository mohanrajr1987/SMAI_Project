<p>I have an issue with using the CKEditor tool. Basically its used for multiple areas of a web tool I use and its works fine, the problem is that the text that is created in areas is used to display elsewhere. Any span tag that does not retain its own copy of attributes will be over written by the pages default CSS.</p>  <p>E.g:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000;font-weight:bold;background-color:#FF0000;"&gt;Test &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; of 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:24px;"&gt;test &lt;span style="color:#000000;background-color:#FF0000;"&gt;2 of&lt;/span&gt; 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;test 3 of 3&lt;/p&gt; </code></pre>  <p>From the above please see line 2 - the middle span specifies the colour and background colour but the outer span specifies the size. When this is loaded into a page with a default CSS that effects spans, the font-size for the inner span will be set to that of the CSS file.</p>  <p>Is there any why to force ckeditor to cascade its styles to all child elements or a way in c# to do it myself?</p>
