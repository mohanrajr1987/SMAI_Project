<p>I need to add an "image" button to CKEditor that shows a pop-up browser window pointing to a URL I specify (always the same) and inserts a string returned from the pop-up at the cursor position. I can manage creating a plugin (I've done a couple already) but can't see how to bring up the window and accept the returned string.</p>  <p>This is to allow integration with a Media Library. The user should be able to navigate around the library at will to select an image, then the window will return a fully-formed  tag in a string when it closes, to place in the editor content.</p>  <p>I can't see anything in the docs that will allow me to add this behavior, but I may be looking in the wrong place - I'm no CKEditor expert. Any help or pointers much appreciated.</p>
