<p>I'm working on a voxel engine at the current time as an experimental project in Unity 3D using the language C#, however, I have come across a problem which whenever I assign a value to a multidimensional array it returns a NullReferenceException, telling me:</p>  <p>"Object reference not set to an instance of an object"</p>  <p>EDIT: As far as I am aware I have created the multidimensional array correctly, so I do not understand what exactly I have done wrong.</p>  <p>I would strongly appreciate it if you could give me some guidance as to how I can fix this, thanks. Here's my code, the commented out line is the line that gives me the error:</p>  <pre><code>using UnityEngine; using System.Collections;  public class Chunk : MonoBehaviour { int chunkSizeX = 16; int chunkSizeY = 128; int chunkSizeZ = 128;  public int[,,] data;  void Start() {     for (int x = 1; x &lt;= chunkSizeX; x++)     {         for (int z = 1; z &lt;= chunkSizeZ; z++)         {             for (int height = 1; height &lt;= 64; height++)             {                 // data[x, height, z] = 1;             }         }     } } </code></pre>
