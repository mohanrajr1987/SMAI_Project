<p>I have been trying with no luck to combine one array into another, multidimensional array.  The first array, <strong>$id1</strong>, is created from a mySQL query.  The second array, <strong>$pictures1</strong>, is created with scandir and will hold up to 24 .jpg file pointers.  I have tried array_merge, array_splice, among others, and a variety of looping functions.  All to no avail. I have read the many forums on combining arrays with no luck.  I'm new to PHP, and i think I'm missing something basic here.  I would appreciate any direction or insight on the correct way to go.  These are the arrays:</p>  <p>$pictures1</p>  <pre><code>Array    (     [0] =&gt; Array         (             [0] =&gt; boxer1.jpg         )      [1] =&gt; Array         (         [0] =&gt; boxer2.jpg         )     ) </code></pre>  <p>$id1</p>  <pre><code>Array ( [0] =&gt; Array     (         [car_id] =&gt; 6         [alt_img] =&gt; boxer     ) </code></pre>  <p>)</p>  <p>I am trying to merge them to create a new array <strong>$pix</strong> The final should look like this:</p>  <pre><code>array(      array( 'car_id' =&gt; '6', 'pic_lg' =&gt; 'boxer1.jpg', 'alt_img' =&gt;       'boxer'),      array( 'car_id' =&gt; '6', 'pic_lg' =&gt; 'boxer2.jpg', 'alt_img' =&gt;       'boxer'),      etc... </code></pre>  <p>Thank you.</p>
