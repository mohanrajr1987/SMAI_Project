<p>This image from the numpy docs left me wondering. If it was a multidimensional list (or <code>ndarray</code>) containing objects with an attribute in common, how can one extract it from <em>specific parts?</em> </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/hAGXN.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/hAGXN.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I have read other questions about how to extract attributes from an entire list and extracting from rows and columns would be easy using list comprehensions, but I can't wrap my head around how to do it, for instance, for the 2nd and 4th slices shown in the image, <em>especially</em> the 4th slice.</p>  <p>This would be useful for a board game I'm making, I could slice the board and check, for example, if a group of tiles have a particular value or if they share a specific attribute.</p>
