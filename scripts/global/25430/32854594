<p>I have two arrays and would like to combine / merge / put them together.</p>  <pre><code>$arr1 = array(     0 =&gt; array(1, 2),     1 =&gt; array(5, 6) );  $arr2 = array(     0 =&gt; array(2, 3),     1 =&gt; array(6, 7) );      come_together_right_now($arr1, $arr2); // the missing function? </code></pre>  <p>and the result would be:</p>  <pre><code>Array (      [0] =&gt; Array (          [0] =&gt; 1          [1] =&gt; 2          [2] =&gt; 3      )     [1] =&gt; Array (          [0] =&gt; 5          [1] =&gt; 6          [2] =&gt; 7      ) </code></pre>  <p>There are way too many array functions! <code>array_merge</code> and <code>array_combine</code> and the recursive alternatives seem to replace the values and they don't preserve numeric keys. How do I do this?</p>
