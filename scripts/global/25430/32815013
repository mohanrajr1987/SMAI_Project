<p>I am trying to combine three arrays into one array. Only keeping the common elements. This is not a duplicate question. I am aware there are other examples online, but that is using int [] and I don't know how to do it with Comparable.</p>  <p>What I need help with:</p>  <ol> <li><p>How to add the single combined/updated array to the 2d array.</p></li> <li><p>How to count the iterations of each time an element gets compared.</p></li> <li><p>If I wanted  how could I change the arrays I have now to a List? - I was thinking maybe that would be easier to add.</p></li> </ol>  <p>I am a newbie to programming and I would appreciate the help. I am trying to learn java just by reading books and searching online.</p>  <p>This is what I have so far.</p>  <pre><code>public class Common{  Comparable [] col_1 = {1, 1, 2}; Comparable [] col_2 = {1, 1, 2,3}; Comparable [] col_3= {1, 1, 2,3,4,}; Comparable [][] collections = {col_1, col_2, col_3}; int comparisonCount = 0   public Comparable[] findCommon(Comparable [][] collections){  int i, j, k, x, y;  for(i = 0; i&lt; col_1.length; i++){     for(j = 0; j &lt; col_2.length; j++){         for(k = 0; k &lt; col_3.length; k++){  comparisonCount++;      // This should be counting but is not...  if(col_1[i].compareTo(col_2[j]) == 0 &amp;&amp; col_1[i].compareTo(col_3[k]) ==0){  //keep searching until last element &amp; allow duplicates &amp; add to collections or a temp[]                   }         }     } }  // Here I'm not sure how to add the elements to the collection   for (x = 0; x &lt; collections.length; x++){     for(y = 0; y&lt; collections[x].length; y++){         collections [x][y] = ?????? // not sure how to add results here         }     } }   public void setComparisons(int count){     count = comparisonCount; }    public int getComparisons(){      return comparisonCount; }    public class Sorting {  public static void main(String[] args) {      Common m = new Common();     //I want to test it from here but I don't know how to initialize each array.              for(int x=0; x &lt; m.collections.length; x++){         for(int y= 0; y&lt; m.collections[x].length; y++){         System.out.println(m.collections[x][y]);     } // what I should be getting is only (1, 1, 2) -  the order is not important really. I just want to learn.       }     System.out.println(m.getComparisons());  } </code></pre>  <p>}</p>
