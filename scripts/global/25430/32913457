<p>I currently have an array looking like this</p>  <pre><code>Array (     [7] =&gt; Array         (             [49] =&gt;              [41] =&gt;          )      [8] =&gt; Array         (             [70] =&gt;              [69] =&gt;          )      [105] =&gt;      [9] =&gt;      [10] =&gt;  ) </code></pre>  <p>Now, I need each to work with each key, but I struggle getting those through a foreach() loop, because there is no values. I have been trying to use array_keys, but that disregards multidimensional keys. Is there a way I can assign the keys as the values as well, to have a structure like this?</p>  <pre><code>Array (     [7] =&gt; Array         (             [49] =&gt; 49             [41] =&gt; 41         )      [8] =&gt; Array         (             [70] =&gt; 70             [69] =&gt; 69         )      [105] =&gt; 105     [9] =&gt; 9     [10] =&gt; 10 ) </code></pre>  <p>This way I could use a foreach() to get the values of each key. I don't know if this is the easiest way, but I would love to get some hints into the right direction. Thanks!</p>
