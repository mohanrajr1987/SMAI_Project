<p>So I have a query; I am accessing an API that gives the following response:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>[["22014",201939,"0021401229","APR 15 2015",Team1 vs. Team2","W",   19,4,10,0.4,2,4,0.5,0,0,0,2,2,4,7,5,0,2,1,10,14,1],["22014",201939,"0021401","APR   13 2015",Team1 vs. Team3","W",   15,4,13,0.4,2,8,0.5,0,0,0,2,2,4,7,5,0,8,1,12,14,1],["22014",201939,"0021401192","APR   11 2015",Team1 vs. Team4","W",   22,5,10,0.4,2,6,0.5,0,0,0,2,2,4,7,5,0,2,1,8,14,1]]</p> </blockquote>  <p>I could just as easily have 16 different variables that I assign zero to, then print them out like the following example:</p>  <pre><code>sum_pts = 0  for n in range(0,len(shot_data)): #range of games; these lengths vary per player        sum_pts= sum_pts+float(json.dumps(shots_array[n][24])) print sum_pts/float(len(shots_array)) </code></pre>  <p>Output: </p>  <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;  23.75 </code></pre>  <p>But I'd rather not create 16 different variables that calculate the average of the individual elements in this list. I'm looking for an easier way that I could get the average of Team1</p>  <p>I would like it the output to eventually be, so that I can apply this to infinite number of players or individual stats:</p>  <pre><code>Team1 AVGPTS AVGAST AVGSTL AVGREB...       23.75  5.3    2.1    3.2 </code></pre>  <p>Or it could be:</p>  <pre><code>  Player1 AVGPTS  AVGAST  AVGSTL AVGREB   ...           23.75    5.3     2.1    3.2 ... </code></pre>
