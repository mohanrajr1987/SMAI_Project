<p>I have a three-dimensional array. </p>  <p>The first dimension has 4 elements.  The second dimension has 10 elements.  The third dimension has 5 elements. </p>  <p>I want to plot the contents of this array as follows. </p>  <p>Each element of the first dimension gets its own graph (four graphs on the page)  The values of the second dimension correspond to the y values of the graphs. (there are 10 lines on each graph)  The values of the third dimension correspond to the x values of the graphs (each of the 10 lines has 5 x values) </p>  <p>I'm pretty new to python, and even newer to graphing.  I figured out how to correctly load my array with the data...and I'm not even trying to get the 'four graphs on one page' aspect working. </p>  <p>For now I just want one graph to work correctly.  Here's what I have so far (once my array is set up, and I've correctly loaded my arrays. Right now the graph shows up, but it's blank, and the x-axis includes negative values. None of my data is negative) </p>  <pre><code>for n in range(1):   for m in range(10):       for o in range(5):         plt.plot(quadnumcounts[n][m][o])         plt.xlabel("Trials")         plt.ylabel("Frequency")   plt.show() </code></pre>  <p>Any help would be really appreciated!</p>  <p>Edit. Further clarification. Let's say my array is loaded as follows: </p>  <pre><code>myarray[0][1][0] = 22 myarray[0][1][1] = 10 myarray[0][1][2] = 15 myarray[0][1][3] = 25 myarray[0][1][4] = 13 </code></pre>  <p>I want there to be a line, with the y values 22, 10, 15, 25, 13, and the x values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (since it's 0 indexed, I can just +1 before printing the label) </p>  <p>Then, let's say I have </p>  <pre><code>myarray[0][2][0] = 10 myarray[0][2][1] = 17 myarray[0][2][2] = 9 myarray[0][2][3] = 12 myarray[0][2][4] = 3 </code></pre>  <p>I want that to be another line, following the same rules as the first. </p>
