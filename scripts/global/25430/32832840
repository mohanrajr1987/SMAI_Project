<p>For the past week I have be struggling to write methods for multidimensional arrays. Here's a picture of something that is related to one exercise that I am doing:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Ufw8qog.png"/></p>  <p>The author references "ROWS" in his third line of code. The author didn't show his declaration but I assume that he is just comparing <code>i</code> to the number of rows in the 2dArray</p>  <p>The author also showed how to test if a top or bottom element exists but not if a horizontal or diagonal value exists. </p>  <p>Using the information provided. Could I please get an example on how to check if an element exists horizontal and diagonal to the specified location. From there I should have enough to piece together the other sides &amp; finish working on a method to compute the average of all neighboring elements in relation to a chosen location within the 2dArray.  </p>
