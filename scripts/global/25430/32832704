<p>If I am given an json.dumps( output that gives a response as the following when focusing on a particular aspect of the response:</p>  <pre><code>[["player1-game1", 2,2,4,5],["player1-game2",6,8,8,9]] </code></pre>  <p>I would like to have it output the average of player one given 2 or infinite number of games played. </p>  <p>What code must I use to get the average of those values in that string:</p>  <p>I would like it to print out the average of elements in [1], [2],... but not in [0] since it's a string.</p>  <p>How might I do this using Python 2.7; I tried using a combination of for loops even trying to set some value to an array in case I had thousands of players or stats.</p>  <p>The output I am hoping to get is:</p>  <pre><code>[player-1, 4,5,6,7] </code></pre>  <p>So [1,...] is the average of ["player-1",(2+6)/2,(8+2)/2,(4+8)/2,(9+5)/2]</p>  <p>Sorry I should have clarified.</p>
