<p>Alright so I'm sure this is pretty simple and all but I have no idea how to use functions. Up until now I was able to get by with everything in main but now I'm required to use functions for just about anything I do. So from my code below, how do I read in  (or w.e. the proper terminology is) a function from main?</p>  <p>EDIT: To clarify to everyone, my question is how can I access the array I returned in main?</p>  <p>Code below takes in the test scores from different amount of students specified by user input.</p>  <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;  int** getTestData();  int main (){      ///this is where I'm lost..     int (*a)[];     a = getTestData();  }  int** getTestData(){     int students, numberOfTests, testScores, i, j;     int** testScoreBank;      // reads in studens     scanf("%i", &amp;students);     testScoreBank = (int**) malloc (sizeof(int)*students);      for(i=0; i&lt;students;i++){         //how many number of tests there are         scanf("%i", &amp;numberOfTests);         testScoreBank = (int*) malloc (sizeof(int)*numberOfTests);         for(j=0; j&lt;numberOfTests; j++){             //the tests themselves             scanf("%i", &amp;testScores);             testScoreBank[i][j] = testScores;         }     }     return testScoreBank; } </code></pre>
