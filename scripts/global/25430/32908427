<p>I am new to C and got stuck on "How to pass multidimensional array to a function". I do understand that you have to pass column size so that if you want to go from <code>a[0][0]</code> to <code>a[1][0]</code> it can calculate the size of 1-D array and can jump over it.</p>  <p>I have written a small program: </p>  <pre><code>#include&lt;stdio.h&gt; void foo(char[][2]); int main() {      char arr[2][2] = {'a','b','c','d'};       foo(arr);      return 0; }  void foo(char temp[][2]) {       temp++;       printf("%c",*temp); } </code></pre>  <p>I expected that this code will print the letter <code>c</code>, since <code>temp</code> initially points to <code>'a'</code> and once we increment it, it will skip over first 1-d array and go to first element of second 1-d array which is <code>'c'</code>. But it does not work that way I guess.</p>  <p>Please explain the how compiler computes these addresses.</p>
