<p>I have a question about 2-D array table. So, the assignment is that we are given a class inside which there is a method called "addCountry" (add country data to the 2-D table). the table is declared and initialized inside the constructor.  The problem is that in another class K for example, the instance of the class that has table is created, and it calls the "addCountry" and every time it calls the method, it wants to put a set of data of one country in it. So, lets say, three times, it calls the method, and there will be three sets of data entered separately. Then, how can I design this "addCountry" method so that each time a new country comes in, it will automatically go to next row?</p>  <p>this is the calling code:</p>  <pre><code>double[]canada={1.1,2.0,3.5}; double[]mexico={1.1,2.0,3.5}; dataSet data = new dataSet(int colm, int row); data.addCountry("canada", canada); data.addCountry("mexico", mexico); </code></pre>  <p>Thanks very much</p>
