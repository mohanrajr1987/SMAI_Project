<p>I would like to assign values to a 2d array in PHP on the fly by using <strong>foreach</strong> statements nested inside of each other. Is the the proper approach to doing the aforementioned. </p>  <pre><code>multiArray = array(array());  foreach ($array1 as $item1) {     $i = 0;     foreach ($array2 as $item2) {         $j = 0;          if ($item2['marker'] === $item1['marker'] {           multiArray[$i][$j] = [$item1][$item2];           $j++;     }     $i++; } </code></pre>  <p>}</p>  <p>My expected output would be an 2d array that would show for each item1, all the item2s that match.</p>  <p>So, potentially it could look like this: </p>  <pre><code>multiArray = array(     array(item1, (object from array2),(object from array2),(object from array2));     array(item1,(object from array2)); ); </code></pre>  <p>Hopefully I worded that well enough to understand. If this is a duplicate please let me know! I didn't see it around though. </p>
