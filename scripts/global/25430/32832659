<p>Gretings,</p>  <p>So I am relatively new to python. I have this code:</p>  <pre><code>vel = [4, 3]  list = [[4, 5]         [6, 4]         [7, 5]         [3, 4]        ] </code></pre>  <p>The numbers are random within a range, but are always ints. I want to add the vel list to each of the sub-lists of list so that I have this result:</p>  <pre><code>list = [[8, 8]         [10, 7]         [11, 8]         [6, 8]        ] </code></pre>  <p>Please show me a <em>'pythonic'</em> way of doing this.</p>  <p>EDIT: I have read other threads about adding the elements of a 1D list, but I can't seem to get it to work with the 2-D list.</p>
