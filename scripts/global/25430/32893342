<p>This is the JSON structure, note that the last entry has 2 multidimensional arrays in it, one for chr 10 and one for chr 12:</p>  <pre><code>{   "_id": "9oFvJYeG9wpdBYunu",   "segments": [     {       "chr": "7",       "start": "140422294",       "end": "155048283",       "length": "29.1",       "snps": "1666"     }   ] }, {   "_id": "HK4WXc5mR6fyesjpP",   "segments": [     {       "chr": "10",       "start": "83865742",       "end": "90981118",       "length": "6.3",       "snps": "1380"     }   ] }, {   "_id": "3N4Z2dtX5PiuqmCFv",   "segments": [     {       "chr": "10",       "start": "83865742",       "end": "90981118",       "length": "6.3",       "snps": "1380"     },     {       "chr": "12",       "start": "32853998",       "end": "44834540",       "length": "5.1",       "snps": "1623"     }   ] } </code></pre>  <p>How can I identify all segments with chr = 10? I want to get the detailed information about the elements  with chr = 10. I want exactly those elements with chr = 10, not give me all documents (with all other their segments) where one of the elements has chr = 10.</p>  <p>Please further note that according to the MongoDB documentation both '$elemMatch' and '$' only return the first match. However my collection has documents where there are two or more elements with chr = 10. I want to get all elements, also in this case with multiple chr 10 elements in one array.</p>  <p>I want to return the following fields:</p>  <pre><code>_id, chr, start, end, length, snps </code></pre>  <p>back. How can I query this in Meteor? I tried <code>$elemMatch</code> an <code>$in</code> but to no avail. If you only answer this for MongoDB please do so, I will try to convert it into Meteor Javascript.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance for your help!</p>  <p>P.S.: this is on the Meteor server side, not sure if that's important</p>
