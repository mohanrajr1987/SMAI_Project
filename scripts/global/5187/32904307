<p>I am new to C++ and trying to understand a code related to OpenCV. It has a class as follow:</p>  <pre><code>class Settings { public:     Settings() : goodInput(false) {}     enum Pattern { NOT_EXISTING, CHESSBOARD, CIRCLES_GRID, ASYMMETRIC_CIRCLES_GRID };     enum InputType { INVALID, CAMERA, VIDEO_FILE, IMAGE_LIST }; . . . . } </code></pre>  <p>what does <code>Settings() : goodInput(false) {}</code> means here. I don't think it is a constructor. Explain this please.</p>
