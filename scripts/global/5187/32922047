<p>Please accept my apologies if I'm getting my verbiage wrong; I'm just now learning C# (my background is mostly Visual Basic and PHP). </p>  <p>What I'm trying to do is create a class / routine in C# (Windows Forms) for connecting and disconnecting to a MySQL database that can then be reused throughout the rest of my project without having to reiterate the code every time.</p>  <p>I've got my class / routine setup, but I'm stuck on trying to call it from the rest of my project. I know in Visual Basic this was a fairly simple task to do, but I just can't seem to figure it out how to do it in C#. </p>  <p>Any suggestions? Thank you in advance.     </p>  <pre><code>public void dbDisconnect(object sender, EventArgs e) {      try      {           MySqlConnection connection = new MySqlConnection(Properties.Settings.Default.mysql_db_conn_string);           connection.Close();      }      catch (Exception ex)      {           MessageBox.Show(ex.Message);      } } </code></pre>
