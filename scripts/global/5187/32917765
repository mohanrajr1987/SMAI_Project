<p>I have implemented all the classes I'm going to use, but I need to create a class that represents the concept of screens, receiving and showing info (so the main fuction gets simpler). </p>  <p>Is there a way to make these screens behave like a stack? I mean, when I don't want some screen anymore, could I "pop" it and go back to the previous one? I am using a different method to each screen, and this class ("Screen") has no attribute, so I think there should be something better I could do.</p>
