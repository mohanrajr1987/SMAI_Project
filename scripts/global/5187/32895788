<p>I am working with this awesome little piece of code, and I need some help figuring it out. </p>  <p>Basically it has a big byte array, which is used to load a new class:</p>  <pre><code>    Class class = class1.loadClass(name, byteArray);     class.getMethod("run", new Class[0]).invoke(null, new Object[0]); </code></pre>  <p>This is loadClass:</p>  <pre><code>    public Class&lt;?&gt; loadClass(String paramString, byte[] paramArrayOfByte) throws ClassNotFoundException         return defineClass(paramString, paramArrayOfByte, 0, paramArrayOfByte.length); </code></pre>  <p>And then it calls the 'run' in this class. Now, besides this being an awesome way to hide your classes, how do I get a look into this class? I have the actual class in 'class', but I don't get further than  the attributes and their values and the function names. I want to know what 'run' actually does. Is there any way to somehow print the content of this method or whatever? Or maybe I can transform the byte array containing the class in something readable? </p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
