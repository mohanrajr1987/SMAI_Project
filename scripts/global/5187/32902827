<p>Is there a way to pass a function call from class to class? For example:</p>  <pre><code>//foo.cpp foo::foo {   ...   myfoo2 = new foo2();   ... }  //foo2.h class foo2 {   ...   public:   void method1();   void method2(int arg2)   ... } </code></pre>  <p>Now I want to use the method of foo2 (eg method2) from outside of the foo class without having to implement the following:</p>  <pre><code>//foo.cpp ... void foo::method2(int arg2) {   myfoo2-&gt;method2(arg2); } </code></pre>  <p>The problem is, that i have quite a lot of these, and this would take a lot of space and does not look nice. Is there any other solution, or at lest a short version with the same effect?</p>  <p>Thank you in advance!</p>
