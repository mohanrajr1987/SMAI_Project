<p>Am currently creating a Server for some app. 'A' joins the room with id "1".  'B' Joins the room with id "32". 'C' joins the room with id '1'. 'D' joins the room with id '32', while 'B' Turns out to 'A'. EDIT NOTE: I don't know what "Turns out to" means in this context</p>  <p>Here is my room class:</p>  <pre><code>class Room(object): #New style classes     def __init__(self):         super(Room, self).__init__()         self.room = None #for now         self.users = []                 def addPlayer(self, player):         self.users.append(str(player))         return self.room #if needed      def removePlayer(self, player):         del self.users[self.users.index(player)]      def getPlayers(self):         return self.users </code></pre>  <p>Here is some pseduo code for what I'd like to be able to do:</p>  <pre><code>A = Room() while True: #loop forever or until someone kills the server     playerEvents = events.get()     if playerEvent.type == Event.Join:         A[playerEvents.room].addPlayer(playerEvents.name)     elif playerEvent.type == Event.Exit:        A[playerEvents.room].removePlayer(playerEvents.name)     elif playerEvent.type == Event.Debug:        print A[1].getPlayers()        print A[32].getPlayers() </code></pre>  <p>Such that if this loop gets 4 events of type join (A, C, and B join room 1 and D joins room 32) and then gets a debug event, what gets printed looks like:</p>  <pre><code>&gt;&gt; [A, C, B] &gt;&gt; [D] </code></pre>  <p>Some related example implementation of what I actually needed to do can be seen in this forked, PHP Server - <a href="https://github.com/ShawnTD/Kitsune-1/blob/master/Kitsune/ClubPenguin/Room.php" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/ShawnTD/Kitsune-1/blob/master/Kitsune/ClubPenguin/Room.php</a> S.T-> It creates a Array (calssed array) for each room, when penguin joins, in my Emulator - <a href="https://github.com/Sprinkle-e/Sprinkle/blob/master/Core/Handlers/Room.py" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/Sprinkle-e/Sprinkle/blob/master/Core/Handlers/Room.py</a> .  Am asking this now, As am gonna rewrite the whole server.</p>
