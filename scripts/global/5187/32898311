<p>I am working on a VSTO add-in for Microsoft Word 2013/2016, using Visual Studio 2015 and C#. This code will open a file and perform many activities. For example, when the user presses the "start" button, the DOCX will open.</p>  <p>Once the Docx file is open, I want to perform functions, such as modifying styles, changing graphic borders, and so on. In total, I foresee a need for about 15-20 of these unique functions.</p>  <p>Since I want the code to be easy to read and update, I decided it would make sense to create a brand new class file that performs these activities, but am struggling because each public method I create has no idea the document is open. It seems I have to create a new object that represents the document each time.</p>  <p>So far, I have come up with the following option, which I don't like:</p>  <p>On the on_click for the button that kicks off the process, write ALL the business logic within that one method.</p>  <p>This is not ideal because I want each piece of logic to be in its own method. Also, I want my business logic to write back information to the form I am working on, but that external .cls file cannot seem to access the form (I read that maybe I can set some get/set properties on the form for this, but ultimately, I would like full control of the form).</p>  <p>Do you have some recommendations to help me with this challenge? I read that #regions might help but do not fully understand how that would make it easier to read the code. Also, I am just an accidental programmer and it is not my day job, so hopefully my question makes sense.</p>  <p>Thank you for any advice you can provide.</p>
