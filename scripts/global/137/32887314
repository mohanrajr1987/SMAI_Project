<p>Consider the following little design:</p>  <pre><code>public class Parent {   public event EventHandler ParentWentOut;   public virtual void GoToWork()   {      ParentWentOut();   } }  public class Mother : Parent {    public override void GoToWork()    {      // Do some stuff here      base.GoToWork(); // &lt;- I don't want to write this in any derived class.                        //    I want base class's method to be automatically called.    } } </code></pre>  <p>Is there any mechanism to make <code>Parent.GoToWork</code> method implicitly and automatically be called whenever this method finishes in overridden version of the descendants (here <code>Mother</code> class) ?</p>  <p>If there is any other language than C# able to do so, I'll be very thankful to know.</p>
