<p>I have an enterprise level application with loads of legacy code, recently we discovered that lots of classes are unnecessarily exposing information(variables are being changed by external users) so I have to walk through all of the classes ( looking at something like 100 packages and each package with 50 odd classes) one approach I can think of to go through all the classes is by generating a javadoc. Any better way of doing the same. </p>
