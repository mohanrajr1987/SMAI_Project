<p>i need to implement the newInstance method in order to make this code to work:</p>  <pre><code>protected IDatabase createDatabase() throws Exception{     return newInstance(CLASS_NAME_DATABASE); }  protected IDataLoader createDataLoader() throws Exception{     return newInstance(CLASS_NAME_DATA_LOADER); } </code></pre>  <p>I'm not allowed to touch this code, but when i try to implement the newInstance as Object it means i need to cast the newInstance in the code above you. Is there a way for me to implement newInstance without changing the code?</p>  <p>Thanks! </p>
