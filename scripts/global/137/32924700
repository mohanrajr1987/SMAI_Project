<p>Trying to understand monads and wondering if they'd be useful for data transformation programming in Python, I looked at many introductory explanations. But I don't understand why monads are important.</p>  <p>Is the following Python code a good representation of the Maybe monad?</p>  <pre><code>class Some:     def __init__(self, val):         self.val=val      def apply(self, func):         return func(self.val)   class Error:     def apply(self, func):         return Error()   a = Some(1) b = a.apply(lambda x:Some(x+5)) </code></pre>  <p>Can you give an example of a monad solution, which cannot be transformed into such OOP code?</p>  <p>(Do you think monads for data transformation in OOP languages can be useful?)</p>
