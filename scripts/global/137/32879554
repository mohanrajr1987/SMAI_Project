<p>I am stuck on designing my priority queues.</p>  <p>I have an implemented class</p>  <pre><code>public class MyObject{     private int attribute_1;     private String attribute_2;     ...  } </code></pre>  <p>I would like to have two priority queues that one sort <code>MyObject</code> by <code>attribute_1</code> and the other sort <code>attribute_2</code>.</p>  <p>How can I realize that?</p>
