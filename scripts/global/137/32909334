<p>I referred a tutorial app from Google playstore named AllTech where it is said that java is not a fully object oriented language as it is using PRIMITIVE TYPE.</p>  <p>I would like to know why it is not fully object oriented language as it is using primitive type. Every object oriented language would have primitive type. </p>  <p>So what a language needs to have to be fully object oriented language?</p>  <p>Thanks for your valuable time for looking into this.</p>
