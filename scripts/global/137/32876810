<p>I don't know much about the JS console but I'm moving into command line programming and it would be good to know my native environment before I start using shell/node in a foreign one</p>  <p>My guess is that all command line statements are invoked <code>with (window) eval(/* whatever user typed before hitting enter/*)</code> but this seems like horrible practice. The context is definitely bound as "Window" if I <code>console.log(this)</code> but I'm not sure why / how</p>  <p>It's almost like the user <code>cd</code>'d into the window object to set it as the context</p>
