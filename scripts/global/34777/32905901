<p>I have a cube that contains a table with the following structure:</p>  <pre><code>Level1 | Level2 | Level3 |   USA        NY   New-York   USA        NY   Niagra Falls   USA        WA   Washington   France  Paris   Montmarte </code></pre>  <p>I want to query this so I get the following, using DAX:</p>  <pre><code>USA     NY       New-York       Niagra Falls    WA       Washington France    Paris       Montmarte </code></pre>  <p>Is this possible to do in one DAX query? Its a representation of the hierarchy.</p>  <p>In the end I want to use this as a filter for an reporting services report, where the user should be able to easy navigate through the hierarchy.</p>
