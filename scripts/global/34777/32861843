<p>I have a set of SSRS reports on Sharepoint via which users can access several Excel / PDF files and can also export reports to Excel / PDF. One of the users has contacted me to say that when the SSRS action links directly to a file he gets an error message saying:</p>  <p>Error: Access Denied Current User You are currently signed in as: *********</p>  <p>He has said that he is able to export other reports to Excel and PDF, and that the problem only occurs when the report goes straight to a file. As far as we both can see the user has full permissions.</p>  <p>Can anyone help with why this may be?</p>
