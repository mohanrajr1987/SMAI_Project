<p>I am working on a problem in SQL Server that is mind boggling. What I am trying to accomplish is, I have a table temp2 (picture below) that houses data from a lot of inner joins which is then used for a SSRS report. </p>  <p>The problem I am trying to solve is, how can I fill in the missing titles for each employee even if they have not put any values in it for the dates provided? </p>  <p>Question is, is it possible to fill in the missing titles from <code>ProjectName</code> for each <code>Employee</code>? As seen in the SSRS report, each employee should have all of the <code>ProjectName</code> being returned from the data set which is reading the table temp2...</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/AbPok.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/AbPok.png" alt="Temp2"></a><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ibQHK.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ibQHK.png" alt="ProjectName"></a><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/P2ssc.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/P2ssc.png" alt="ssrs reporting"></a></p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>  <p>So This is what I tried and even Though I have gotten all the projectnames into my temp2, this is ugly and inefficient. The ssrs will take too long to run because of unwanted data. </p>  <pre><code>Select distinct Employee = Coalesce(a.Employee, @SelectEmployee), EmpId = Coalesce(a.EmpId, (Select PkId from AllRef Where Ness='All')), c.Day, Title=Coalesce((case when a.Title like '%-%'              then left(a.Title, charindex('-', a.Title))              else a.Title         end),''), p.ProjectName, Description =coalesce(a.Description,''), Val = Coalesce(a.Val,''), AbbrevJob = COALESCE(a.abbrevjob, ''),                  week1Total=(select sum(val) as week1 from temp1 WHERE  day &gt;= Dateadd("d", -14, @WeekEnding) AND day &lt;= Dateadd("d", -7, @WeekEnding)),                 week2Total=(select sum(val) as week2 from temp1 WHERE  day &gt;= Dateadd("d", -7, @WeekEnding) AND day &lt;= @WeekEnding )  from dbo.Calender as c left outer join temp2 as a on c.Day = a.Day  cross join ProjectName p --on p.PkId = a.Abbrevjob-2 Where c.Day &gt;= Dateadd("d",-13,@WeekEnding) and c.Day &lt;= @WeekEnding  order by EmpId asc </code></pre>  <p>The Cross Join did accomplish the task but the repetition is killing performance. Anyone knows how to deal with that?</p>
