<p>I have main report with two subreports: 1. Sales 2. Monthly Data.</p>  <ul> <li>Sales(subreport) has collapse/expand on row grouping</li> <li>Monthly Data(subreport) have row grouping and expand/collapse column grouping.</li> </ul>  <p>Both subreports can render the expand/collapse when exported to excel individually.</p>  <p>Now, the problem is when I exported the report to excel through the main report which calls both the subreport only the monthly data report has expand/collapse only...in addition to this, the expand/collapsed is visible in report preview for both the subreport when I preview it through my main report. </p>
