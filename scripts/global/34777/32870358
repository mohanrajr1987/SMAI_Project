<pre><code>= "All Business - Values - " &amp; iif(Parameters!Limit.Value(0) ="N","Under 50k",      iif(Parameters!Limit.Value(0) ="Y" ,"Over 50k", "All" )) </code></pre>  <p>I have been trying to get this to work all day. Can someone please help.</p>  <p>I have a multi-select parameter of 'Y', 'N' and All to select both of them.</p>  <p>My issue is with the report header, I want it say 'Over 50k' when Y is selected and 'Under 50k' when 'N' is selected which it does correctly.</p>  <p>I want it to say "All" when both is selected but it is saying "Over 50k" whenever both 'Y' and 'N' is selected.</p>  <p>Please advise.</p>
