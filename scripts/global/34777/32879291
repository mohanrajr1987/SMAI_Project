<p>I use report service (rdlc report) in visual studio 2013</p>  <p>A textbox was assigned value via expression like these </p>  <pre><code>     =First(Fields!String.Value, "MyDataset") </code></pre>  <p>This <strong>String.value</strong> is used for creating barcode. Report must be remain layout's scale. So the Textbox was set "canGrow" is false.</p>  <p>It has problem when String.value is too long.So it will start new line like these </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/abEUx.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/abEUx.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I think I can solve this problem by reduce font size if string is too long. But I don't know How to check multiline text in textbox? I try to put this expression in the Font -> FontSize property as follows</p>  <pre><code>   =iif(len(Fields!String.Value) &gt; 20, "8pt", "10pt") </code></pre>  <p>But it is not flexible. What possible if creating flexible expression for any textbox.</p>
