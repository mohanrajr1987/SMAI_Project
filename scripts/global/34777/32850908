<p>I am new to Reports in SSRS. I am facing problem in page break in ssrs. The problem is that I want to break the page whenever the sum of amount field in my table is greater than or equal to 20000. I want an output like this:</p>  <p>Page1 A       2000 B       6000 C       4000 D       5000 total  17000</p>  <p>Page 2 E       5000 F       5000 G       5000 H       5000 total  20000</p>  <p>and so on...</p>  <p>Can anybody help me get out the solution please? Thank you in advance</p>
