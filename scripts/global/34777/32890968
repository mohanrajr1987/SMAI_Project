<p>We are using reporting services with the Schedules feature, but somehow we can't see older schedules that we made a few months ago. When I go to <strong>My Subscriptions</strong> in the upper right corner, we only see the reports that were made in the last 3 months. All the other ones (and the one I need) aren't there. Even when I go to the report in question, it doesn't show the subscriptions I am looking for.</p>  <p>However, when I go to the database that reporting services uses, I can see all the reports, even the ones from more than 3 months ago. I used this query:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT      dbo.catalog.[Path],    dbo.catalog.Name,   s.Description,           u.UserName,          s.DeliveryExtension FROM catalog with (nolock) JOIN dbo.Subscriptions s with (nolock)     ON s.Report_OID = dbo.Catalog.ItemID JOIN dbo.Users u WITH (nolock)     ON u.UserID = s.OwnerID ORDER BY dbo.catalog.[Path],s.Description </code></pre>  <p>All the schedules have the same owner.</p>  <p>How come I can't see a lot of my schedules on the report server "site" and how do I find them?</p>
