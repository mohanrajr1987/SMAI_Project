<p>I'm working in SSRS and I'm trying to create dynamic month and year header columns to look like this: <br><br> Oct 2015 | Nov 2015 | Dec 2015 | Jan 2016 | Feb 2016 <br><br> The code I've tried is this: <br> <code>=MONTHNAME(Today), TRUE) &amp; " " &amp; YEAR(Now)</code><br><br> This gives the desired result, and I know if I do +1, it'll go to the next month or year, but what happens when it turns January? How can I make sure next year's months have 2016?Is this possible? Not sure if I'm making sense on this, but I can clarify if needed. <br><br> Basically, I have 12 columns that have the months in them, and the column names will slowly move to the left. How can I make sure the year corresponds with the correct month when the year changes?</p>
