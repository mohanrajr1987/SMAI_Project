<p>It seems so basic and surely resolved in SSRS 2014 SP1 but I can't find a way in Print Layout (for PDF ultimately, but this is simple display) to <strong>allow a tablix to render at the top of following pages when a text box displays above it on the first page</strong> (eg. address details which would not be wanted on every subsequent page filled by tablix results). This results in unprofessional wasted white space above the results on every page after the first. </p>  <p>The tablix seems "stuck" so it only starts on the page wherever you put it on the design layout (using Report Builder because SSDT not playing with VS2015, but same things should apply). That's when the text box above it naturally doesn't even display on the subsequent pages - why would it, it's done its job and is not repeateable! After all, it's not in a header.</p>  <p>Have set the textbox to CanShrink=true but its still holding the space (because it's content remains, fair enough). </p>  <p>Also tried hiding the textbox (and should be able to do this conditionally on subsequent pages) but whitespace is still there, which is odd and perhaps shows the real limitation.</p>  <p>Applied ConsumeContainerWhitespace=true on report level (you would have thought that would do the trick) but no joy.</p>  <p>Even put both textbox and tablix in a same Rectangle so they become "peers" and maybe control the whitespace better, but nope.</p>  <p>Would prefer the header to repeat and the textbox address to only be on the first page, but another annoying limitation is that for headers there's only a "PrintOnFirstPage" option, not one to print on first page only! Of course, a workaround for that like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16306092/ssrs-report-builder-only-show-header-on-first-page-with-page-numbers">SSRS Report Builder - Only Show Header On First Page (With Page Numbers)</a> is to move textbox into the body area and hide, but as noted, that still leaves the stupid whitespace on every subsequent page - d'oh!</p>  <p>Surely there's a way to resolve this basic requirement, or maybe I'm missing something obvious?</p>
