<p>I have a question regarding 'Subscriptions' for SQL Server Reporting Services, any help would be greatly appreciated. Users are granted access to setup their own 'Subscriptions' and they are able to do so successfully. After a few days the 'Subscriptions' are mysteriously disappearing and the users are not receiving the report summary in their email. Users then have to go back into the Subscriptions page and create a new Subscription which then again seems to vanish on its own. I have looked all over the web and have not been able to find any information on this particular issue. Any ideas?</p>
