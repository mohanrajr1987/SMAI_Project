<p>Hi we have this application that generates excel file (.xlsx) from Reporting Services 2012 with type <code>"EXCELOPENXML"</code> then send  notification on outlook so that the users can view the excel file in their iOS devices but now they cannot view it and their phones display below message:</p>  <pre><code>Cannot Open XML Spread sheet excel </code></pre>  <p>It works though when I save the generated file to my laptop, open it and save it again in MS excel manually and send to outlook which is not acceptable to be done by our users.</p>  <p>Anyone experience this and find any solution on this?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
