<p>I've been spending the last few hours googling for an answer and I'm beginning to think I'm the only human being on Earth having to cope with this problem. So I'll ask my first ever question on Stack Overflow.</p>  <p>We are building a large solution for one of our customer using Microsoft Dynamics 4. I'm in charge of SSRS reports and I'm using Visual Studio 2005 to build my reports, which I then upload with the crm's UI.</p>  <p>Everything works fine, really, except this one little thing: when using pre-filtering (eg. CRMAF_<em>SomeEntity</em>), I'd like to remove/disable the default filter (Modified in the last 30 days) without having to go in the UI and delete it. </p>  <p>I want this because everytime I add a new report or modify one. Or worst, everytime code is migrated to a new environment we have to delete the default filter for 27 reports (more to come), one by one. But I still want pre-filtering to work using CRMAF_<em>SomeEntity</em>.</p>  <p>There must be some setting somewhere where we can configure this option. But I can't find anything.</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
