<p>I have a report that displays the following data:</p>  <ul> <li>Quantity</li> <li>Line Item Total/Extended Price (this is based off of a formula of rate * quantity)</li> <li>Product Type (i.e. Type A, B, C, D, &amp; Other)</li> </ul>  <p>At the bottom of the report, I would like to add a small two column table that takes the total quantity and price by the product type. </p>  <p>The table will only ever have 5 rows - row 1 = Type A, etc.  Columns will be "Qty" and "Total" which should represent the sum of each based on the type.</p>  <p>I am struggling getting a RunningValue formula to work with a IIF statement that would filter based on type.</p>  <p>Here is what I have tried in cell A1 of the table (to display qty total for type a only):</p>  <p>=IIf(Fields!type.Value="A",RunningValue(Fields!quantity.Value, Sum, Nothing)</p>
