<p>I'm doing such a thing;</p>  <pre><code>=Sum(Fields!TOTAL.Value) - Sum(Fields!IND.Value) </code></pre>  <p>In cells, so this is end up with expresion "&lt;&lt;'Expr'>>", that means I'm finding net worth price - discount for each saled products, after that I want to sum all of those product's sales on bottom, like </p>  <pre><code>=Sum(Sum(Fields!TOTAL.Value) - Sum(Fields!IND.Value) ) </code></pre>  <p>Any chance for that? I also tried like;</p>  <pre><code>=Sum(ReportItems!TOTALBOX.Value) </code></pre>  <p>But not work either.</p>  <p><strong>Edit;</strong> <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/cOpwo.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/cOpwo.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I'm doing something like that but on final, I want to sum those values which "&lt;>" created.</p>  <p>Thx.</p>
