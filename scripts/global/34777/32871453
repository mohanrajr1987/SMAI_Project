<p>I have the following conundrum:</p>  <p>I made a code inside my report that basically accumulate value, here:</p>  <pre><code>Dim number as Double   Function Accumulate(ByVal value as Double) As Double  number=number + value  Return number  End Function </code></pre>  <p>And I made a calculated field like this:</p>  <pre><code>Code.Accumulate(Fields!MyField.Value) </code></pre>  <p>Now, the field <code>Myfield</code> It's a number so the Function will run smoothly, the problem is the following expression I want to apply the code:</p>  <pre><code>=FormatNumber(RunningValue(Fields!MyOtherField.Value, Sum,"Dataset"), 2) </code></pre>  <p>I can't because as you see it have an aggregate function so I can't create a calculated field with this expression.</p>  <p>Is there any way I can apply my code to this expression or I have to create a code that does the same as this expression?</p>  <p>If you need more info, ask away and I will edit my original thread.</p>
