<p>I have a report R1 that includes a few instances of subreport R2 within a tablix. R2 highlights some rows dynamically by changing their font style:</p>  <pre><code>=IIf(Fields!DA.Value="2","Bold","Normal") </code></pre>  <p>If I render R2 separately everything works as expected, some rows are in normal font others are in bold. But when R1 is rendered the rows of the subreport are displayed in normal font. How do I fix this?</p>
