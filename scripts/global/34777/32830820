<p>Because we design in a multi tier release environment, we have similar data on 3 SQL servers.  We may have three copies of the same report directed to the different data bases.  We name the reports with the source in the name.  i.e. Report 1 UAT.  Users do not pay attention.  When a report is run and exported, you can no longer see the name so what looks like a production report could be a UAT copy.  What I am trying to do is add a placeholder in the title that lists the data source for the reports primary dataset.  I thought I would find a resource that said dataset1.datasource that returned the name I had assigned the data source at creation.  That does not appear to be the case. Any ideas how to accomplish the same thing.</p>
