<p>I have a cell expression in which Im trying to force it to simply display an empty cell if the underlying value is something other than a number, is zero or null etc.  There is no formatting in the textbox properties.</p>  <p>Surely there is something simpler</p>  <p>What I have now</p>  <pre><code>        =IIF(IsDBNull(ReportItems!YE_Goal2.Value) OR       ReportItems!YE_Goal2.Value = 0 OR  ReportItems!YE_Goal2.Value Is Nothing,  "",ReportItems!Projected2.Value/ReportItems!YE_Goal2.Value) </code></pre>  <p>When there is no value, it displays a 0 instead of being blank.</p>
