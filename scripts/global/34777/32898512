<p>I have a SSRS report where i have multiple subreports each have their own dataset. The main report where the subreport is at doesn't have any DataSets. </p>  <p>We are directly rendering the report as pdf as follows</p>  <pre><code> byte[] bytes = viewer.LocalReport.Render("pdf", null, out mimeType, out encoding, out extension, out streamIds, out warnings); </code></pre>  <p>in an empty page. </p>
