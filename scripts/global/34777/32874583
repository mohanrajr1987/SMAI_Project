<p>I have googled countless of times on finding out <em>When the grid report expanded, the chart displays a bar graph</em>. So I would have a separate pie chart and a separate collapsible grid report when I click on the toggle function, it will display another graph which is a bar graph.There aren't any helpful information on that. I'd tried having the bar chart within the same scope as grid but that doesn't work either. I was wondering if this is possible in an ssrs tool such as visual studio data tools. If yes, any advice or suggestions would greatly be appreciated. Thanks so much!</p>
