<p>I'm building a report in SSRS and using the sumlookup function and report code from <a href="http://salvoz.com/blog/2013/05/27/sum-result-of-ssrs-lookupset-function/" rel="nofollow">http://salvoz.com/blog/2013/05/27/sum-result-of-ssrs-lookupset-function/</a> . I have used it and it has worked well in the past but now no matter what I do the function returns 0.</p>  <p>Here's the equation: </p>  <p>=Code.SumLookup(LookupSet(Fields!Program_ID.Value, Fields!Program_Id.Value, Fields!Weight.Value,  "FirstDateRangeDataSet"))</p>  <p>The equation should return a value of 407,058 . </p>
