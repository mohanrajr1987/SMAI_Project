<p>I am not able to disclose very much information, but our software is in the healthcare industry on the practice side. My company is building a new web based product, in which our users will be able access and run reports. We are working to make it a single page dashboard interface where they can select a report from one of the 100+ reports that we have available in our other product. </p>  <p>Advice that I need is in how to generate the reports. We would like to avoid having to create separate forms for each report, and instead have a way to use the fields in the report to generate the form. My thoughts are that we should be able to build a framework for this that would make everything simpler.</p>  <p>I apologize in advance for how convoluted this explanation is. Any advice is greatly appreciated.</p>
