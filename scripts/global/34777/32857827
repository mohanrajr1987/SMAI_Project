<p>I am using report services  2008. When I create the Pie Chart and set the PieLabelStyle to "Outside" and clicked "enable 3D"  in the ChartArea Properties, sometimes the full label cannot be showed (e.g. my label is "ABC company". the pie chart show "ABC ..." in the pie chart. I would like to know any solution to always show the whole label.</p>  <p>If I disable the 3D effect, the whole label can be showed.</p>
