<p>I have created an SSRS report which I am using in Asp.net website. Reports accepts server, database,user and password to create connection string dynamically. Dynamic connection string is required because user can select a database at the time of log-in and that database need to be used for SSRS.</p>  <p>One requirement is such that user should be able to create SSRS report himself. For the purpose I provided guideline that how to create parameters that are require data-source's dynamic connection string.</p>  <p>One possible problem I thought is if user do not make parameters as hidden, he will have database credential in clear text.</p>  <p>I thought of adding encryption at asp.net website and decryption in SSRS report but decryption function/code will be easily accessible at the time of designing.</p>  <p>Any idea how to overcome the situation?</p>
