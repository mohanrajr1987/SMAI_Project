<p>I'm having some more extra keywords for <a href="http://emtopx.steptoinstall.com/" rel="nofollow">MY SITE</a>. That's all are Keywords and some are repeated. So I can't show that things to reader/user.</p>  <p>Then I'm having one option. i.e,</p>  <pre><code>visibility: hidden </code></pre>  <p>in CSS.</p>  <p>Can I use this? Is it usefull? or any <strong>other Options?</strong></p>
