<p>I created a new website and I do not want it to be crawled by search engines as well as not appear in search results.</p>  <p>I already created a robots.txt </p>  <pre><code>User-agent: * Disallow: / </code></pre>  <p>I have a html page. I wanted to use </p>  <pre><code>&lt;meta name="robots" content="noindex"&gt; </code></pre>  <p>but Google page says it should be used when a page is not blocked by robots.txt as robots.txt will not see noindex tag at all.</p>  <p>Is there any way I can use both noindex as well as robots.txt?</p>
