<p>I'm working on a ASP.Net MVC project in which there is no difference in url formats between logged in user and normal user, they all  browse pages like these urls:</p>  <pre><code> www.example.com/home/contents (anyone)  www.example.com/home/about (anyone)  www.example.com/order/list (page for logged in user)  www.example.com/help/contact (page for logged in user)  www.example.com/buy-now (custom url for route order/buy action) </code></pre>  <p>I want to move user logged in pages to different folder so that search providers will not index these pages. Pages that are not log-in needed should remain with same url. So result should be </p>  <pre><code> www.example.com/home/contents (anyone)  www.example.com/home/about (anyone)  www.example.com/user/order/list (page for logged in user)  www.example.com/user/help/contact (page for logged in user)  www.example.com/user/buy-now (custom url for route order/buy action) </code></pre>  <p>How can i achieve this? </p>
