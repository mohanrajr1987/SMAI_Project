<p>I need some help... I have been using iframe to pull in my blog to my index page. I'm fearful that this is not really helping my SEO, may be probmatic on some viewports and seems to be a hassle in designing responsive web pages. I "think" I want to take the content from the blog and code it into a section on the index page and maintain it there. I'd like to add all the social media buttons. I don't really get comments so I'm not worried about that. Is my reasoning sound or have I gone off the deep end....? </p>
