<p>We've implemented rich snippets for a product type, as well as rich snippets for the organization type.</p>  <p>Both types have their attributes passed into a JSON+LD type script wrapper.</p>  <p><strong>Please see the markup and validation here: <a href="https://developers.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool?url=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.jomashop.com%252Fpanerai-luminor-men-watch-pam00104.html&amp;filter=RICH_SNIPPETS_PRODUCTS" rel="nofollow">Structured Data Testing Tool</a></strong></p>  <p>Google picks up the organization type and this is verifiable because we've actually changed the logo on our organization card. </p>  <p><strong><em>However, Google has not picked up any of the rich snippets attributes for our products.</em></strong></p>  <p><strong>Note</strong> Both the product snippet and organization snippet validate perfectly, without any errors or warnings on the Structured Data Testing Tool. I do not think this is an issue with markup unless there is something instrinsically wrong with JSON+LD formatted rich snippets (as opposed to the inline markup variety)</p>  <p><strong>Additional Note</strong> These JSON+LDs have been printed inside all of our product pages (30,000+) for well over 3 months now, with no change. This is most likely not an issue of time to propagate.</p>  <p><strong>Further Note</strong> We are a very heavily trafficked website that Google shows respect to in search results. So I do not think that obscurity is the cause.</p>  <p>So, my question is: <strong><em>What are some possible reasons the above linked JSON+LD markup is failing? Is it possible that Google is intentionally ignoring it? What are some potential solutions to solving this issue?</em></strong></p>
