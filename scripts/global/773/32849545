<p>I need some guidance from the professionals here. I have been working on a website for more than 2 months but none of the keywords have indexed yet? I have checked the webmaster tools and everything looks fine to me. On-page is perfect even though I have performed relevant off page activities on these keywords but seems like they are of no use. I am not sure why these keywords are not getting index in SERPs?  Can anyone please tell me what could be the reason behind this?</p>
