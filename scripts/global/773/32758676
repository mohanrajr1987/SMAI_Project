<p>I'm in a process of implementing Rich Snippets for my commerce site's products. I would appreciate hearing what is the best practice when it comes to stock availability.</p>  <p>My inventory system is accessible through API. The input for this API is product ID and Store ID.</p>  <ul> <li>How frequent I need to update the page with the stock information?</li> <li>Do I need to notify Google each time there is a stock change?</li> <li>And another question, I assume Google will not index my page immediately, in this time frame the user will see something in SERP which is different than the one on the page?</li> </ul>
