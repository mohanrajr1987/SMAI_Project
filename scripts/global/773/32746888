<p>I canceled my SSL certificate subscription but all my pages are indexed with https on search engines.</p>  <p>So I added a redirect to my .htaccess file</p>  <pre><code>RewriteCond %{HTTPS} on RewriteRule (.*)$ http://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [R=301,L] </code></pre>  <p>but I still can't go through the old https links without getting a warning:</p>  <p>The certificate for this website is invalid. You might be connecting to a website that is pretending to be www.flashmavi.com, which could put your confidential information at risk.</p>  <p>What am I doing wrong?</p>
