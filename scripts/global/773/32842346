<p>I'm trying to get the organic search volume in the UK for a large (>40,000) list of keywords.</p>  <p>Given that you can now only get ~800 keywords at a time from google's own tool, it would be impractical to gather them this way.</p>  <p>I understand the Adwords API is no longer giving out keys.</p>  <p>I have also tried using grepwords, which I am also having issues with (that's a separate problem).</p>  <p>Does anyone have any other way of collecting this data?</p>  <p>Cheers!</p>
