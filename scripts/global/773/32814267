<p>as the title says im a rookie in the 'URL Rewriting' field and i'd like to ask a question that could help many others like me.</p>  <p>Let's say we have an url like this:</p>  <pre><code>http://myepicsite.wow/index.php?value_x=1&amp;value_y=2&amp;value_z=3 </code></pre>  <p>How can one rewrite this url to something like this(seofriendly) without writing a line of code for every page that is generated from those _GET[] variables? :</p>  <pre><code>http://myepicsite.wow/index.php/1/2/3 </code></pre>
