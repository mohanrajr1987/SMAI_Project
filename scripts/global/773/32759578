<p>Is there any way to change the actual structure of a url in Shopify, rather than just the handle? For instance if I add a product it will be available at the following urls:</p>  <ul> <li><code>/products/some-product</code></li> <li><code>/collections/collection-name/products/some-product</code></li> </ul>  <p>Is there any way I could change this to <code>/collection-name/some-product</code>, i.e. remove unnecessary words from the url?</p>  <p>I also realise you can add redirects, but this isn't what I want.</p>
