<p>I am testing a site on Google PageSpeed Insights and receiving the message:  Eliminate render-blocking JavaScript and CSS in above-the-fold content</p>  <p>However the render-blocking "JS/CSS" are google apis (ie. <a href="http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato:400" rel="nofollow">http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato:400</a>).</p>  <p>Is there a way to surpass this without causing styling issues? The googleapis come from different plugins/the theme (dynamically generated I believe). </p>  <p>For Mobile this is listed as "Should Fix:" aka in the RED. </p>  <p>Any help is appreciated, Thank you.</p>
