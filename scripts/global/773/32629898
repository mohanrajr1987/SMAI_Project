<p>i'm looking for someone using Ghost CMS for his blog because i have some questions.</p>  <p>I'm updating my blog website, and i did a search work to find the better cms , other than WP (WP i hate you !)</p>  <p>I found Ghost which is very light, usefull , and worked with <strong>NodeJS</strong>.</p>  <p>But here is my question : Considering that <strong>contents will be load from javascript</strong> and no php, what about SEO with <em>Google</em> ?</p>  <p>I've already tried to search on France's forum, but no result.</p>
