<p>I have a humble question :)</p>  <p>i plan to set up a rather unusual webproject with about a thousand pages, where there won't be a classical navigation (only for about page and contact) and all pages won't link to one and another.</p>  <p>its index > opens random page > opens random page > opens random page.. all via a small php action..</p>  <p>i know from basic SEO understanding, that you should then generate a static directory like a sitemap, that links to all pages, so that google finds all pages from the index downwards..</p>  <p>BUT i don't want users, to see it.. it kills the fun on using the site, when you can see all content pages at a glance.. this project is all about exploring random things..</p>  <p>is this somehow possible? to have a dead end index page and a thousand dead end html pages that are only connected via a php script?</p>  <p>thanks in advance..</p>
