<p>I have a website with .com domain. For ex, xyz.com. it is already ranked in google SEO and it is now localised for India region. I want another domain for specific Australia region. for ex, xyz.com.au </p>  <p>Both domain with run at a time with minor content changes like contact us page. rest of the contents are same. Is it create issue with Google marking content as duplicate and put penalty on site?</p>  <p>Is there a way to perform .com.au website's SEO for Australia and .com SEO for just global just like Google, eBay and many other sites do?</p>
