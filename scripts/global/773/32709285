<p>I want to access my website by IP and domain but I don't want google indexing IP. Taking example of google, I can access google by both domain / and IP 202.166.193.159/. I tired 301 redirect in <code>htaccess</code> by doing like this</p>  <pre><code>RewriteEngine On RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^202\.166\.193\.159$ RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://www.google.com/$1 [L,R=301] </code></pre>  <p>This doesn't give me the solutions. I want to access by both but don't want indexing by IP.</p>
