<p>I have a question regarding search engines. I'm currently running a wordpress website but I have 84 standalone pages that are not linked to by a menu. </p>  <p>The goal was to have a landing page for certain big cities in my country, so when sombody google's webdesign in X city, they would see a landing page for that city. </p>  <p>Now the problem is, these pages are not on any search engine. How can I fix this? Or wat causes this issue?</p>  <p>I've already submitted my sitemap to both Google &amp; Bing and all the pages are indexed except for the standalone pages.</p>
