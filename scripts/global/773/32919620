<p>I have been trying to generate a sitemap for my website which is based on angular. I have tried the automatic sitemap generators but they are unable to crawl through my website since apart from the homepage the routing is handled by angular instead of server. I tried using grunt as well but it's not working as expected, of all the grunt modules available we just define the site root and a source folder, it crawls through the source folder appending each html to the site root with the relative path but since the routes have been created using the route-provider from angular, the links generated from using grunt fairly becomes unusable. So is there any way of generating site map apart from manually generating it?</p>
