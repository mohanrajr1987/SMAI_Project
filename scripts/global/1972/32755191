<p>I managed to configure my Apache to run cgi scripts and I tried to use javascript to generate output.</p>  <pre><code>#!C:\php\php.exe  &lt;script&gt;   document.write("Hello world!"); &lt;/script&gt; </code></pre>  <p>However this only sends the contents and the <code>document.write</code> is run on the client. I'd like to send <em>Hello world!</em> by javascript.</p>  <p>I know there is nodejs. I wonder if there is a module for Apache or some settings that enables running javascript on the server and send only the contents of <code>document.write</code>?</p>
