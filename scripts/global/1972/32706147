<p>In one of my projects I'm using <code>cgi.escape()</code> to escape a set of titles that I get from a resource. These titles could be from Youtube or anywhere else, and may need to be escaped. </p>  <p>The issue I'm having is that if a title is already escaped from Youtube and I pass it into <code>cgi.escape()</code>, I end up getting double-escaped titles, which is messing up later parts of my project.</p>  <p>Is there a library that will escape strings but check if a piece is already escaped, and ignore it?</p>
