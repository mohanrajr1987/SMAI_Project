<p>The following piece of code should be able to run in Python 2.7 and Python 3.x.</p>  <pre><code>from __future__ import unicode_literals from __future__ import print_function  import cgi try:     from StringIO import StringIO as IO except ImportError:     from io import BytesIO as IO  body = """ --spam Content-Disposition: form-data; name="param1"; filename=blob Content-Type: binary/octet-stream  value1 --spam-- """  parsed = cgi.FieldStorage(     IO(body.encode('utf-8')),     headers={'content-type': 'multipart/form-data; boundary=spam'},     environ={'REQUEST_METHOD': 'POST'})  print([key for key in parsed]) </code></pre>  <p>In Python 2.7 it runs fine and it outputs <code>['param1']</code>. In Python 3.4 however, it outputs <code>[None]</code>.</p>  <p>I cannot get <code>FieldStorage</code> to get a usable result in Python 3. I suspect something internally changed and I'm now using it wrong. However I can't seem to figure out what. Any help is appreciated.</p>
