<p>I'm trying to accomplish the following:</p>  <ul> <li>Pull information from a module through Python. [Accomplished]</li> <li>Constantly pull information from Python for use in HTML.</li> <li>Avoid writing the entire HTML/CSS/JS document in print statements.</li> </ul>  <p>I've seen the term CGI thrown around, but don't really understand how it works. Simply put, I want to run the Python script which returns an integer value. I then would like to take that integer value into JavaScript so that it may update the designated tag. It should be able to execute the Python script every two seconds, receive the output, then apply it to the page. I do not want to write out the entire HTML document in Python by doing one line at a time, as I've seen some people doing on sites I've found.</p>  <p>It seems like doing something like this is far more complicated than it should be. The page should run, call the script for its output, then give me the output to use.</p>
