<p>I want to make a multiplayer game that have a desktop and a browser version.  In the server (Linux) will be a running game server written in C++.  But how I can connect the AJAX of the page to that game server?</p>  <p>I read that I can use php with named-pipes, also can be done writing in a file with php or in a database. I also try CGI, I think that is better than the other ways, but CGI starts the program by default. Is there any way to send the received data to the stdin of the proccess or something like that? Are more ways to connect the browser and the server?</p>
