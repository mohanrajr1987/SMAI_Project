<p>When I invoke a CGI script (GET request) using either Chrome or Firefox, I noticed in the Apache access log that quite a few seconds later a HEAD request and a GET request with the same URI were being generated.  To make sure it was not a peculiarity of my Apache setup, I wrote a simple Perl script and installed it on my ISP's website.  This script simply does it's own logging to a disk file every time it is invoked of the time, the URI, the user agent, the remote address and port:</p>  <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl -wT use strict; use CGI;  my $cgi = new CGI; print $cgi-&gt;header(-type=&gt;'text/plain', -expires=&gt;'-1d'); print "hello";  open (LOG, "&gt;&gt;printenv2.txt"); my ($sec, $min, $hr, $day, $mon, $year) = localtime; my $timestamp = sprintf("%02d/%02d/%04d %02d:%02d:%02d", $mon + 1, $day, 1900 + $year, $hr, $min, $sec); print LOG $timestamp, "\n"; my @keys = qw(REQUEST_METHOD REQUEST_URI HTTP_USER_AGENT REMOTE_ADDR REMOTE_PORT); foreach (@keys) {     print LOG "$_ = $ENV{$_}\n"; } print LOG "\n"; close LOG; </code></pre>  <p>I invoked the script once with <a href="http://localhost/friends/forms/cgi/printenv2.cgi?arg=1" rel="nofollow">http://localhost/friends/forms/cgi/printenv2.cgi?arg=1</a></p>  <p>The script was run three times, however, the last two runs occurred more than 14 seconds after my initial invocation.  Here is the output of the log:</p>  <pre><code>09/11/2015 19:25:26 REQUEST_METHOD = GET REQUEST_URI = /friends/forms/cgi/printenv2.cgi?arg=1 HTTP_USER_AGENT = Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/45.0.2454.85 Safari/537.36 REMOTE_ADDR = 127.0.0.1 REMOTE_PORT = 58421  09/11/2015 19:25:40 REQUEST_METHOD = HEAD REQUEST_URI = /friends/forms/cgi/printenv2.cgi?arg=1 HTTP_USER_AGENT = Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:10.0) Gecko/20150101 Firefox/20.0 (Chrome) REMOTE_ADDR = 127.0.0.1 REMOTE_PORT = 58428  09/11/2015 19:25:41 REQUEST_METHOD = GET REQUEST_URI = /friends/forms/cgi/printenv2.cgi?arg=1 HTTP_USER_AGENT = Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:10.0) Gecko/20150101 Firefox/20.0 (Chrome) REMOTE_ADDR = 127.0.0.1 REMOTE_PORT = 58440 </code></pre>  <p>As you can see the user agent associated with the two spurious invocations is different.  I ran SpyHunter to see if I had a virus.  I tried disabling all extensions.  I tried un-installng and re-installing Chrome.  Nothing helps.  This only occurs with Chrome and Firefox - the problem does not appear with Internet Explorer.</p>  <p>HELP!</p>
