<p>I'm not really a programmer but I'm making basic changes to a pre-existing cgi script to adapt it for a new data form on my site.</p>  <p>Basically this is a form that users fill out, the form collects data and writes that data to a separate data file.</p>  <p>There is a line of code in it that, based on the form responses received, either spits out an "information missing" response or a "submission received" response depending on what response is given. For example:</p>  <pre><code>if (( $firname eq "" || $lastname eq "" || $email eq "" )) </code></pre>  <p>I'm trying to add another line where people will receive the same responses as above but where they will get a "info missing" if they don't put an accepted code into one a specific field. I've succeeded with this:</p>  <pre><code>if (( $firname eq "" || $lastname eq "" || $email eq "" || $code ne "12345" )) </code></pre>  <p>(With this code if the user doesn't put "12345" into the field they receive an "information missing")</p>  <p>The next step, which I haven't been able to work out, is how to allow two or more responses on the code. In other words, how can the user be allowed to input "12345" <em>or</em> "67890"? Here are some attempts I wrote that did NOT work:</p>  <pre><code>if (( $firname eq "" || $lastname eq "" || $email eq "" || (( $code ne "12345" || $code ne "67890" )) )) if (( $firname eq "" || $lastname eq "" || $email eq "" || (( $code ne "12345" &amp;&amp; $code ne "67890" )) )) if (( $firname eq "" || $lastname eq "" || $email eq "" )) || if (( $code ne "12345" &amp;&amp; $code ne "67890" )) </code></pre>
