<p>Below is my test.cgi file. The params coming in from the html are:</p>  <pre><code>{"FirstNum"=&gt;["3"], "SecondNum"=&gt;["3"]} </code></pre>  <p>Why isn't the <code>a.class</code> showing up as an integer? I need to do math with the values, and the form sent them as an integers. Even the Ruby <code>.to_i</code> doesn't work.</p>  <pre><code>#!/RailsInstaller/Ruby2.1.0/bin/ruby  require 'cgi'  cgi = CGI.new puts "Content-type: text/html\n\n"  arr = cgi.params  a = arr['FirstNum']  a.each do |a|   puts a.class end </code></pre>
