<p>I have just made a server (only for localhost) in Python to execute by CGI to execute and try my Python scripts. This is the code of the file that executes the server:</p>  <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python #-*- coding:utf-8 -*-  import BaseHTTPServer import CGIHTTPServer import cgitb cgitb.enable()  ## This line enables CGI error reporting  server = BaseHTTPServer.HTTPServer handler = CGIHTTPServer.CGIHTTPRequestHandler server_address = ("", 8000) handler.cgi_directories = ["/"]  httpd = server(server_address, handler) httpd.serve_forever() </code></pre>  <p>When I access some script in the server (<code>http://127.0.0.1:8000/index.py</code>) there is no problem, but when I access the server (<code>http://127.0.0.1:8000/</code>) it shows:</p>  <pre><code>Error response  Error code 403.  Message: CGI script is not executable ('//').  Error code explanation: 403 = Request forbidden -- authorization will not help. </code></pre>  <p>It's like if index files aren't set as default file to access when access a folder instead of a specific file...</p>  <p>I would like to be able to access to <code>http://127.0.0.1/index.py</code> when I access <code>http://127.0.0.1/</code>. Thanks for everything.</p>
