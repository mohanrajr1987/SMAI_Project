<p>Environment settings</p>  <p>OS : RHEL 6.6 (kernel 2.6.32) - x86_64</p>  <p>httpd : httpd-2.2.15-39</p>  <p>perl : 5.10.1-136</p>  <p>CGI API :</p>  <p>perl-CGI-3.15-136</p>  <p>perl-CGI-Session-4.35-6</p>  <p>I am using a static html page with Perl-CGI defined variables in the static html. This html is read in through perl, and then passed to a perl CGI script for eval. Note:</p>  <p>While reading the static html, I am using UTF-8 encoding like</p>  <pre><code>open( IN ,"&lt;:encoding(UTF-8)", $file_path ) </code></pre>  <p>After reading the status HTML page, the output is passed back to the CGI script through a variable and then pressed in to eval to evaluate the variables.</p>  <p>Finally, the eval(uated) output from CGI is print which can be read through http daemon. In the CGI script I am using</p>  <pre><code>binmode(STDIN, ':encoding(UTF-8)'); binmode(STDOUT, ':encoding(UTF-8)'); </code></pre>  <p>The static HTML looks something like this <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/x5msO.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/x5msO.png" alt="actual_html (static)"></a></p>  <p>When I check the output of print in the CGI script, I see the complete output as desired, like this <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/a1csE.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/a1csE.png" alt="cgi print data"></a></p>  <p>However on the Browser, the hidden input fields are getting truncated in an unwanted manner. Like this</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/EFYmf.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/EFYmf.png" alt="truncated html"></a></p>  <p>When I checked the wireshark output for the text/html, which is being printed back from the server to the browser, this is also getting truncated. Like this <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ll442.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ll442.png" alt="wireshark scan"></a></p>  <ul> <li>The HTML header has proper Content-Type and charset declaration.</li> <li>The same code is working fine with EN language</li> <li>The same code is working fine with zh(chinese) language as well.</li> <li>When the language is set to japanese in the browser, and we read from HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE that it is 'ja', than we print the japanese specific data.</li> <li>We are not using cgid module of apache.</li> </ul>  <p>Are we supposed to use some special encoding for japanese language?? Or it is a double encoding issue. I have tried removing the encoding when I am reading the static html file, however, that also did not help.</p>  <ul> <li>The same code is working fine with RHEL 5.x (2.6.18-308), and perl-CGI-Session (4.42-2), perl (5.8.8-38) httpd (2.2.3-63), there was no perl-CGI in RHEL-5.x.</li> </ul>
