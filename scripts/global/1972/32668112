<p>I have a CGI script named <code>check.cgi</code>. It uses JavaScript files from the directory <code>SCRIPTS</code> which is located in the same directory as <code>check.cgi</code>. I use Python's <code>CGIHTTPServer</code> as an embedded server which uses the directory with <code>check.cgi</code> as a current work-dir. If I want to call some script from the <code>SCRIPTS</code> dir I simply refer to it, eg, as <code>SCRIPTS/init.js</code>. Under Python's <code>CGIHTTPServer</code> everything works just fine! But then I want to place <code>check.cgi</code> file and <code>SCRIPTS</code> dir in Apache's <code>cgi-bin</code>. I access it as <code>localhost/cgi-bin/check.cgi</code> from within browser. The script is executed but it seems to unable to locate the <code>SCRIPTS</code> dir. Where should I place <code>SCRIPTS</code> dir so that my CGI script sees it?</p>
