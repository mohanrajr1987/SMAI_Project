<p>Our web app stores a session value to indicate a client's location using the CGI::Application::Plugin::Session module. This value is not part of the url and we do not need or want to use virtual hosts for each location. I want to have Apache split the error_log into separate "location" logs in real-time, not by using or creating a post processing parser. I thought the way to go would be by piping the logging to an external program to handle the split, using the syntax below, but I'm not sure how to access the session location value via that external program during run-time:</p>  <pre><code>ErrorLog "|/usr/local/etc/apache24/some_program.pl" </code></pre>  <p>Is this even possible?</p>
