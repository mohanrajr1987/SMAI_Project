<p>I'm trying to compile some coda using CUDA with MakeFiles generated by CMake.</p>  <p>I'd like to use CHECK_CXX_COMPILER_FLAG or something similar to check if the used nvcc version supports a given flag. In my case it is "--expt-relaxed-constexpr" (Cuda 7.5) and "--relaxed-constexpr" (Cuda 7?)</p>  <p>Of course I could compare the CUDA version but I find the compile-flag check more fail-safe.</p>  <p>Is there any CMake command similar to CHECK_CXX_COMPILER_FLAG that invokes the nvcc compiler and not the host compiler?</p>
