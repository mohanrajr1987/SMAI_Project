<p>I installed OpenCV 3.0.0 but I'm having troubles any C++ or Python code using OpenCV. For testing, I went into the directory <code>opencv-3.0.0/samples</code> and ran <code>cmake</code> to build the samples. I got the following error:</p>  <p><code>CMake Error at /usr/share/cmake-2.8/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:108 (message): Could NOT find CUDA: Found unsuitable version "5.5", but required is exact version "7.0" (found /usr)</code></p>  <p>However, I'm pretty sure that I have the CUDA 7.0 installed and I verified by getting the following output from <code>nvcc --version</code> on the command line:</p>  <p><code>nvcc: NVIDIA (R) Cuda compiler driver Copyright (c) 2005-2015 NVIDIA Corporation Built on Mon_Feb_16_22:59:02_CST_2015 Cuda compilation tools, release 7.0, V7.0.27</code></p>  <p>Why might OpenCV think that I got the wrong version installed? Is there a workaround for this?</p>
