<p>I am trying to implement a random forest in CUDA, each thread being an individual decision tree, which requires recursion. However, my computer does not support recursion in CUDA.. So I am trying to use data structures like queue to perform the recursion part.I googled but I can't find much information about that, and I tried using Thrust inside CUDA kernel but it won't compile.. So is there a way to use queue inside a CUDA kernel? Thanks in advance!</p>
