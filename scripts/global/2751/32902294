<p>I would like to ask you a question about the concurrent kernel execution in Nvidia GPUs. I explain us my situation. I have an code which launchs 1 sparse matrix multiplication for 2 different matrix (one for each one). These matrix multiplications are performed with the cuSPARSE Library. I want both operations can be concurrently performed, so I use 2 streams to launch them. With Nvidia Visual profiler, I´ve observed that both operations (cuSPARSE kernels) are completely overlaped. The time stamps for both kernels are:</p>  <ul> <li>Kernel 1) Start Time: 206,205 ms - End Time: 284,177 ms.</li> <li>Kernel 2) Start Time: 263,519 ms - End Time: 278,916 ms.</li> </ul>  <p>I´m using a Tesla K20c with 13 SMs which can execute up 16 blocks per SM. Both kernels have 100% occupancy and launch an enough amount of blocks:</p>  <ul> <li>Kernel 1) 2277 blocks, 32 Register/Thread, 1,156 KB shared memory.</li> <li>Kernel 2) 46555 blocks, 32 Register/Thread, 1,266 KB shared memory.</li> </ul>  <p>With this configuration, both kernels shouldn´t show this behaviour, since both kernels launch an enough number of blocks to fill all SMs of the GPU. However, Nvidia Visual Profiler shows that these kernels are being overlaped. Why?. Anyone could explain me why this behaviour can occur?</p>  <p>Many thanks in advance.</p>
