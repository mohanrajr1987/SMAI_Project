<p>I'm confused about understanding the differences between GPU memory peak throughput vs GPU bandwidth. Taking as example the GTX 470 with a memory bandwidth of 133.9 G/s. When I run cuda bandwidth-test I get a bandwidth of only 6267.8  MB/s for  1 GB of data. So my question is how 133.9 GB/S turned into only 6267.8 MB/S ?</p>  <p>Is this about the latency occurrence ?</p>
