<p>I currently have a 2d matrix (a graph adjacency matrix) i create a simple kernel which does some computation using the adjacency matrix but does not modify it.</p>  <p>Since the kernel does not modify it i have stored the matrix in constant memory for better performance.</p>  <p>I read somewhere that nvidia provides only 64kb of constant memory, if i have a large graph where the size of adjacency matrix is greater than 64kb, how do i store if for best performance considering that it is not modified by the kernel.</p>  <p>Any suggestions please?</p>
