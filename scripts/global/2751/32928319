<p>I am trying to run one of the examples for <a href="https://github.com/pcpratts/rootbeer1/tree/master/examples/MMultApp" rel="nofollow">MatrixMultiplication</a> and to create GPU compliant jar using Rootbeer Java compiler I am running the following command: </p>  <p><strong>java -Xmx8g -jar Rootbeer-1.2.4.jar MMultAp2.jar MMult-GPU.jar -64bit -norecursion -nodoubles</strong>.</p>  <p>But on the logs after sometime I get:</p>  <p>.... getEntryPoints:  running transform2 on: ... compiling CUDA code for 64bit only... /data/users/araman1/.rootbeer/generated.cu(350): warning: statement is
