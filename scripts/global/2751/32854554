<p>When trying to debug my code with cuda-gdb I run into this error as soon as my code tries to call the CUDA API:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Error: Internal error reported by CUDA debugger API (error=10). The application cannot be further debugged.</p> </blockquote>  <p>My workstation is Ubuntu 14.04, my code is compiled with the CUDA 7.0 toolkit.</p>  <p>The cuda-gdb version is:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>NVIDIA (R) CUDA Debugger   6.5 release   Portions Copyright (C) 2007-2014 NVIDIA Corporation   GNU gdb (GDB) 7.6.2</p> </blockquote>  <p>The version of my NVIDIA driver is:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>NVRM version: NVIDIA UNIX x86_64 Kernel Module  346.82  Wed Jun 17 10:37:46 PDT 2015   GCC version:  gcc version 4.8.2 (Ubuntu 4.8.2-19ubuntu1)</p> </blockquote>  <p>I've seen a couple of similar questions on the NVIDIA developer zone forum but unfortunately nobody came up with a solution.</p>
