<p>I am planning to purchase a Titan Z as per the requirement of my project. I am currently using GTX 980.</p>  <p>So for the upgrade, are any code changes required or the same code would work fine? if so, please mention what amendments are required </p>  <p>Also, the base clock is more in Titan X, so is it a better option than Titan Z?</p>
