<p>On my CUDA program I see large variability between different runs (upto 50%) in communication time which include host to device and device to host data transfer times over PCI Express for pinned memory. How can I explain this variability? Does it happen when the PCI controller and memory controller is busy performing other PCIe transfers? Any insight/reference is greatly appreciated. The GPU is Tesla K20c, the host is AMD Opteron 6168 with 12 cores running the Linux operating system. The PCI Express version is 2.0.</p>
