<p>I'm trying to build cuda-convnet project from Win10 OS with VS2010, any idea how to solve the ' LINK : fatal error LNK1104: cannot open file 'cutil32D.lib'</p>  <p>(I'm following the steps indicated in this page: <a href="http://vision.group.shef.ac.uk/wordpress/?p=1" rel="nofollow">http://vision.group.shef.ac.uk/wordpress/?p=1</a>)</p>  <p>Note:  I found in an older post that I should build the common folder in the main samples folder, I chose to build a VS2010 solution but nothing have changed unfortunately..</p>  <p>EDIT: I just discovered that my machine doesn't have Nvidia -enabled GPU, that's why the code didn't work.</p>
