<p>I know parse has this functionality through the session tokens but the guide doesn't show you how to use them and I need some help. </p>  <p>Currently I am checking if the user is logged in or not by:</p>  <pre><code>$currentUser = ParseUser::getCurrentUser();  if($currentUser == null){     // not logged in } else{    // logged in } </code></pre>  <p>But whenever I restart the browser, the user is logged out because the _SESSION data is deleted. How can I check for a valid parse session token using PHP to use persistent login?</p>
