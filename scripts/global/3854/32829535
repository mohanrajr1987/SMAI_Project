<p>If we are making a messenger program that requires a login and a password (and client and a server), then, I assume, we actually need a security token, exactly in the same way you would on the web.</p>  <p>In fact, if the client has a valid security token that it sends to the server to perform any action, then the fact that the token matched means that any action (even "delete my account") is valid (unless we have a really good hacker). Right?</p>
