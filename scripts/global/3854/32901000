<p>the question title may not be cleared of what i am asking.</p>  <p>My question is pretty general in all login system design with Facebook/google/twitter, and how can i avoid a hacker to generate fake data to register on my application.</p>  <p>Here is more detail of what i want to ask:</p>  <p>When a person press "login with Facebook" and authenticated with facebook, my app should have this user's email, user_id and access_token, then i can use these data on my own database to create the user account and log in the user. <strong>So here is what i can't figure out</strong>. A hacker can easily generate a fake email/user_id/access_token and create a POST request to my server acting as a valid Facebook login. If this is the case, people can easily hack into all other linked/merged accounts from my app's database? Am i right? if so, how to avoid this? if not, what am i missing?</p>  <p>Thanks in advanced!</p>
