<p>I am new to the Microsoft SQL Server world. </p>  <p>I installed SQL Server on my computer, I logged in with the server name dot (<code>.</code>) it was good. But later I changed my Windows user account to Administrator. Now the problem is that I cant login with <code>.</code> (dot) and <code>(local)</code> again, as my old user account was able to. </p>  <p>Kindly let me know how to fix this. I couldn't find the solutions for this online. </p>  <p>I am using it in my own pc its not in network.</p>
