<p>I am using the Java Websocket API and I want to create an APP where the User is able to Login.</p>  <p>But I have no clue how to handle this, I tried a lot and there are a lot of ways to do this by other software but I want to make it very simple by only using the websocket API.</p>  <ol> <li><p>Should I create a Websocket session and then ask the User for his credentials or should I make it like this:</p>  <p>var wsUri = "ws://" + document.location.host + document.location.pathname + "username" + ":" + "password"; var websocket = new WebSocket(wsUri);</p></li> </ol>  <p>I mean this seems very unsecure, so I tried to figure out how to use the EndpointConfig Interface, maybe it works with that but I don´t know how.</p>  <ol start="2"> <li><p>How to let a user be "logged in", because everytime I refresh the browser, a new session starts? In my Endpoint I store all sessions like this:</p>  <p>private static Set peers = Collections.synchronizedSet(new HashSet());</p></li> </ol>  <p>...but as I said there is no chance to identify the client by it´s credentials</p>  <p>I am very new with Websocket or Web-programming at all, so don´t blame me for this pls</p>  <p>Best Regards</p>
