<p>So, I'm using a simple login-script for a few pages, using sessions to identify the user, by putting the users name in a $_SESSION variable and then checking if the variable is set on each page. This worked fine when I ran the script locally through a WAMP-server - but when I uploaded it to a webhotel I ran into a weird issue.</p>  <p>The login-script, which sets the $_SESSION variable if the username and password matches up with information from a MySQL-database, somehow won't start the session. I have session_start(); at the top of every page, including the login-script, so I don't understand why it wont start.</p>  <p>Now, I found a script on here that is used to check for session-support:</p>  <pre><code>     &lt;?php       // Start Session       session_start();       // Show banner       echo '&lt;b&gt;Session Support Checker&lt;/b&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;';       // Check if the page has been reloaded      if(!isset($_GET['reload']) OR $_GET['reload'] != 'true') {          // Set the message          $_SESSION['MESSAGE'] = 'Session support enabled!&lt;br /&gt;';         // Give user link to check         echo '&lt;a href="?reload=true"&gt;Click HERE&lt;/a&gt; to check for PHP Session Support.&lt;br /&gt;';        }         else {           // Check if the message has been carried on in the reload            if(isset($_SESSION['MESSAGE'])) {             echo $_SESSION['MESSAGE'];            }            else {              echo 'Sorry, it appears session support is not enabled, or you PHP version is to old. &lt;a href="?reload=false"&gt;Click HERE&lt;/a&gt; to go back.&lt;br /&gt;';             }        }    ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>The really weird thing is that this script tells me that session-support is enabled - and after running it, it suddenly works across all the pages. So I have to run this script (in its own file) every time I access the site, because the login-script won't set the $_SESSION variable without running this script first.</p>  <p>JUST TO MAKE SURE: I am NOT asking how to check if session-support is enabled or not; the issue is why sessions are not enabled untill AFTER I run the script above.</p>  <p>Why is this happening, and how do I fix it?</p>
