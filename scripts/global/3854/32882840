<p>I understood how to login to Gmail using c#, but when I try to go to the webpage it does not recognize I have logged in to Gmail.</p>  <p>Overall, I need to login to Gmail, and then access a webpage once I'm logged in, and save its source code, all using c#, preferably without having to open a browser, just doing all within the c# application.</p>  <p>Edit: I have logged in to Gmail successfully. But when I then go to the website, it doesn't recognize that I'm logged in. I need a way to do it in the same session. I tried researching but couldn't understand how to do it.</p>
