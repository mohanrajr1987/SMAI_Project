<p>I'm building an android app, that must have login system and its own users list. I found the example how to manage sign in and sign up for users by means of PHP on MySQL server. I found also that in Android there is a possibility to manage login accounts on the phone (like Google and WhatsApp do).</p>  <p>What is the differences between these two methods ?</p>  <p>Are they complementary to each other or two alternatives ?</p>  <p>Where the Users database is stored in case of the Android account manager ?</p>  <p>If i log in into Android managed account, how can i know about other users which are logged in ?</p>
