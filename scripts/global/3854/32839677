<p>I'm creating automated tests in Protractor for our site. you have to login first in order to do anything on the site. my problem is that for specific test (spec) - I can (have) to add 'login' - currently located in Page Object page.  the problem is that when creating a sanity test that uses multiple tests (using 'Suite') - I currently have to login for every specific test and then logout at the end so the next test will work properly (since it login at first). what is the right way to do it? on one hand I want that every test will work on its own (login at first) - but on the other hand - when using it in sanity test- I want to login and logout only once during the sanity test.</p>  <p>this is the suite part from the conf.js file:</p>  <pre><code>suites:{     sanity: ['*/AccountSettingsTest.js','*/createApptest.js','*/openSourcePageTest.js','*/whatsNewTest.js']  },  specs: ['*/AccountSettingsTest.js'], </code></pre>  <p>This is how I currently use the login:</p>  <pre><code>var LoginPage = require('../global/LoginPage'); ... var login = new LoginPage(); ... login.clickLogin(); </code></pre>  <p>Thanks.</p>
