<p>I would like to know the complete list of useable control characters for a custom welcome message. I am using Mint 17 Cinnamon with the MDM login and HTML welcome screen.</p>  <p>The login control panel in Cinnamon says "%n will display hostname"...</p>  <p>For shizzngiggles, I entered a big random string of %*'s in the Cinnamon control panel... A bunch of them returned data, but I'm also assuming some didn't, as the HTML formatting simply displayed a layered jumbled mess within the welcom div tag. I scoured the internet and couldn't find a clear answer or concise list. I also looked here, but there are over a thousand posts about control characters, but none of them specific to MDM login.</p>  <p>I have noticed in other posts that there is sometimes a way to print out what control characters can be used within certain programs/shells also...</p>  <p>So I guess the final question is:</p>  <p>What is the list of control characters that MDM login recognizes, and can I execute a command to display them/print them to a file for reference?</p>  <p>Thank you in advance!</p>
