<p>we have a MediaWiki installation successfully running. It is set up so that every user has to login with username and password before being able to read or edit anything. This works fine, if the main page is accessed and the user is not logged in yet, the login page is shown.</p>  <p>However, after logging in, the user is not redirected to the main page but sees the login page again. If one now enters the main page manually into the browser address, one can access the page, so the user is actually successfully loggged in. If one logs in again, one gets the error message, that one is already logged in.</p>  <p>Does anybody have an idea of how to resolve this strange behaviour? I would like the user to be redirected to the main page or any other page that he/she requested after successfully loggin in.</p>  <p>Thanks and best regards. Any help appreciated since I was not able to find any helpfuls hints/similar problems on google or stackoverflow.</p>  <p>Stephan</p>
