<p>this morning when I typed facebook it kept showing a blank page on chrome, I thought it's a chrome problem, then I opened firefox, typed facebook.com the page opened perfectly but when I typed my id and password and pressed login it went blank again ! </p>  <p>Then I went to my friend who was doing facebook just fine then I logged out from his account and tried to login into my fb account on my friend's laptop, and again blank ! </p>  <p>Oh and I searched for my facebook page from my friend's account and it's there, timeline and everything, it exists and active, just I can't access it but people can see me write on my wall etc.</p>  <p>So it's clear that something happened to my account overnight and I don't think my account is hacked or anything like that because it doesn't show any id/password error or any error at all.. it just goes blank when I tried to enter my account. I remember at least 12 hours ago it was fine !</p>  <p>What's going on with my account ? Please help.</p>
