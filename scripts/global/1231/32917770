<p>I have a Virtual Box that has Ubuntu installed on it, and have been trying to download the Sugar Labs DEV onto it via command line in bash.  I have been using the instructions found at this link: <a href="https://developer.sugarlabs.org/dev-environment.md.html" rel="nofollow">https://developer.sugarlabs.org/dev-environment.md.html</a></p>  <p>But whenever I try to pull ./osbuild, I get the error message "/bin/sh/ 1: Syntax Error: "(" unexpected".  I have been doing some research, as to how to fix this, but have been unsuccessful. I haven't done anything extra, just been sticking right with the instructions, so I am very confused.</p>  <p>Any pointers as to how to overcome this would be very appreciated. </p>
