<p>I am trying to write a simple command line program in Windows, but it doesn't look very nice. Is there a library to generate CLIs that look closer to something like GUIs?</p>  <p>For example:</p>  <pre><code>                         Hello Program 1.0 (bar with white background)  Progress Bar: (bar with green background like in Windows OS)  Some Labels...     Cancel (Button with blue background)                      OK (Button with blue background) </code></pre>  <p>I wasn't able to find a solution on the internet, yet. I don't want to make a real graphic window, I want to use the command line.</p>
