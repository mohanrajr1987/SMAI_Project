<p>I would like to copy and rename multiple files to a new folder (that probably doesn't exist), and the files have different extensions but the same name.</p>  <p>So in folder A there will be files like : name-road.txt, name-road.csv, name-road.jpg, name-road.tif, name-water.txt, name-water.csv, name-water.jpg, name-water.tif etc. And i would like them to be in folder B with a different name but same extensions, like this : road.txt, road.csv, road.jpg, road.tif, water.txt, water.csv, water.jpg, water.tif etc.</p>  <p>I'm using <code>robocopy D:\Folder1 D:\Folder2 name-road.txt, name-road.csv, name-road.jpg, name-road.tif</code> to copy the files and then <code>ren D:\Folder2\name-road.* road.*</code> </p>  <p>It works fine for one category of file but i would like to be able to do this for all the files (water, buildings etc.) without having to type a new <code>robocopy</code> and <code>ren</code> command line for each of them. Something like a loop perhaps.</p>
