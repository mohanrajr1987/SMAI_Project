<p>my problem is that liquibase is not rolling back some of my changesets that have been executed after a tag was set on the change set i am trying to rollback too.</p>  <p>For example I have created two changesets (A and B) which execute as normal. and then i have created another changeset which sets the tag of changeset B to release1. and this changeset also works as expected. however i then execute another 5 changesets all with rollback commands. and these also execute fine.</p>  <p>Now the problem comes when i run the following:</p>  <pre><code>java -jar liquibase.jar --changeLogFile=..\database\changelog-create.xml rollback release1 </code></pre>  <p>Now shouldn't this rollback any changesets that were executed after the release1 tag was executed?</p>  <p>If so, this is my problem, they are not being rolled back. but in console i get Rollback was successful.</p>
