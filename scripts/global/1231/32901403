<p>I understand that when you right click on <code>runsikuliX.cmd</code> and select "Run as administrator", will enable you Sikuli scripts to run smoothly.  Please advise on how can I can implement this via command line. I tried executing the following command but still click and find actions were not triggered:</p>  <pre><code>runas /env /user:&lt;localhost&gt;\Administrator runsikuliX.cmd -r sikuli script </code></pre>  <p>I'm using Windows 8 64 bit, java 1.7.0_45.</p>
