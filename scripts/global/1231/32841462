<p>For personal preference reasons , and updating simplicity, i prefer the installation location /opt (when i install from source).</p>  <p>But for example if i install node or ffmpeg to /opt (./configure --prefix=/opt) the commands are not available in command line, but if i wouldn't use the prefix it would. I should be creating i guess a script but i have no idea to which location and how.</p>  <p>Some more detail: I have installed nginx server in /opt/ , and i have created an executable script in /etc/init.d/ and its working fine, but i have no idea how to do that with node or ffmpeg since as far as i know they are not service but something more like "environment variables".</p>  <p>Any solution appreciated, thanks.</p>
