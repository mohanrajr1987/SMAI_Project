<p>I need to call a Javascript function from a website running in Google Chrome from the command line. </p>  <p>Is there any possibility to get access over the developer tools from outside via command line? Is there an extension I could use to execute code?</p>  <p>The most convenient way would be to have access to the Chrome developer console from the command line.</p>  <p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>  <p>To make it more clear: Let’s say the website I’m on has this function defined:</p>  <pre><code>function hello() {   alert("hello"); } </code></pre>  <p>I would like to call this function, but I don’t have access to the developer tools in Chrome. I can only access the Mac OS X Terminal (via SSH). It’s a setup in a gallery without keyboard.  Some kind of pipe may be needed.</p>
