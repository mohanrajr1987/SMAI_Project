<p>In referring to the answer in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18683022/how-to-get-code-coverage-using-android-studio?answertab=votes#tab-top">How to get code coverage using Android Studio?</a>, we could generate Junit Test coverage on Android Studio. I could even dump out the Coverage Report in HTML format using menu Analyze->GenerateCoverageReport... </p>  <p>I'm thinking of getting this run from command line to get the test run with Coverage, and automatically dump out the Coverage Report in a designated folder. Is there a command that I could do so? (I'm in a linux/mac environment)</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
