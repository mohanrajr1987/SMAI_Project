<p>I need to make an application as console app. The app should have custom commands to be execute. How can i archive that?</p>  <p>For example GitHub like command line.</p>  <p>Is there any way I can do that and integrate it with the cmd? Can someone point me into the right direction?</p>  <p>Ok, an example then:</p>  <p>Like this command that will allows me to find all files that match with our internals criteria:</p>  <pre><code>c:\user\me&gt;pkg connections_files </code></pre>  <p>It should returns a list of connection files. Notice the <code>pkg</code> command, it a custom one. Thats what Im looking.</p>
