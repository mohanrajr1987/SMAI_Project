<p>so to add a file I need to run <code>git add</code> and to remove a file <code>git remove</code></p>  <p>but this seems to be a very time consuming job if the project has a lot of files that change on my local copy and then the remote repo needs to be updated.</p>  <p>is there some automatic way to sync the local repo with the remote one, like in the GUI version of git? the gui vesion automatically adds new files and removes deleted files</p>
