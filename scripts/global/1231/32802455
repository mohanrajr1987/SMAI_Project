<p>I'm using Luanch4j to distribute a jar so it can be easily executed under windows. The jar is a CLI tool that takes multiple arguments. So when a player wants to use it, he actually needs to have a terminal (cmd) open.</p>  <p>I'd like the default behavior of launch4j to be to open that command line window if the exe is directly double clicked. Currently, when i double click on it, it launches my tool which prints out the help (as no argument has been given) then the windows closes before anything could be read. One solution would be to find out how i can keep the cmd window open after the help has been printed for the user to be able to input his commands.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
