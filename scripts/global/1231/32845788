<p>I have a Java project uncompiled. Entry point is the main method in <code>maui.main.MauiModelBuilder</code> which is passed some parameters by command line.</p>  <p>The author of the code provides this suggestion to compile it:</p>  <pre><code>java -cp "lib/*:src" maui.main.MauiModelBuilder -l data/automatic_tagging/train/ -m test -v none </code></pre>  <p>What's the meaning of <code>"lib/*:src"</code> in this case? I never saw such a syntax.</p>
