<p>I have to take quite a few steps before I get into the file I need to be, which is why I'm trying to set up an alias in my terminal, that gets me to the file by running that alias.</p>  <p>The following steps are needed to arrive where I have to be:</p>  <ol> <li><code>cd Sites</code>  </li> <li><code>vagrant ssh</code>  </li> <li><code>cd /var/www/miniportal.billetten.dk/logs/</code> </li> <li><code>sudo -s</code> </li> <li><code>cd /etc/apache2/sites-available/</code> </li> <li><code>nano 25-av_miniportal.conf</code>  </li> <li>Edit line 33 in that file (I guess it's possible to jump to that line)</li> </ol>  <p>I tried setting up an alias like this, but the problem is that it stops running the rest of the command after I SSH'd into <code>Vagrant</code>. if I manually <code>exit</code> Vagrant, it continues the command (and of course returns an error, because there is no such folder).</p>  <p>The question is: How do I make sure that everything from step 3 is executed AFTER step 2 is done logging in through SSH?</p>  <p>My ultimate goal is to set up an Apple Automator program that lets me put in a value that gets entered on line 33, but I'm fine with just an alias for now.</p>
