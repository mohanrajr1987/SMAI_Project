<p>I want to run an oracle online backup through the rman setup in 12c. I have 3 scripts that need to be run and they are:</p>  <ul> <li><code>rman target sys@[db_name]/[db_password] nocatalog</code></li> <li><code>configure channel device type disk clear;</code></li> <li><code>RUN {   ALLOCATE CHANNEL c1 DEVICE TYPE DISK FORMAT 'C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\Backup\%U';   BACKUP DATABASE PLUS ARCHIVELOG; }</code> </li> </ul>  <p>I want to be able to run them as a single entry through a c# <code>Process</code> object. I want to emulate using a command line and not a batch file. </p>  <p>So, I've looked at a few questions/answers and have used <code>&amp;&amp;</code> to try and combine the commands but that didn't quite work. It took the first two commands and connected me to the RMAN center but the <code>RUN</code> command didn't execute (most likely because of the <code>;</code> within that part of the script). </p>  <p><strong>EDIT* - actually only the first command was run. The second did not execute.</strong></p>  <p>My question: Is there a way that I can combine these 3 script items into 1 to run through the c# <code>Process.Start()</code> method? </p>
