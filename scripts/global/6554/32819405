<p>I'm using imagemagick to create an animated GIF out of ~60 JPG 640x427px photos. The combined size of the JPGs is about 4MB. </p>  <p>However, the output GIF is ~12MB. Is there a reason why the GIF is considerably bigger? Can I conceivably achieve a GIF size of ~4MB?</p>  <p>The command I'm using is:</p>  <pre><code>convert -channel RGB # no improvement in size     -delay 2x10 \    -size 640 \    -loop 0 \    -dispose Background # no improvement in size     -layers Optimize # about 2MB improvement     portrait/*.jpg portrait.gif </code></pre>  <p>Using <code>gifsicle</code> didn't seem to improve either. </p>
