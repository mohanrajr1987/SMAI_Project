<p>I want to have a feature where a thumbnails of uploaded photos is pixelated or blurry with a touch icon overly on top, so that a user will have to hold on the thumbnail if they want to view the full unobscured photo.</p>  <p>Is there a way to get ios to generate the pixelated thumbnails before uploading them to the server?  Should I just use a ridiculous jpeg compression value? </p>  <p>Or, should I do this server side using Node.js and ImageMagick? </p>
