<p>How do I batch resize animated gifs with imagemagick? I have this script which works for single images but I must specify both the exact image name.</p>  <pre><code>convert {path to image with filename}.gif -coalesce -resize 200x200 \         -layers optimize-frame {output name}.gif </code></pre>  <p>mogrify -path seems to batch process but animations all come out broken with mogrify.</p>
