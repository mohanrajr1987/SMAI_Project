<p>When I upload a file to my app in production a bunch of files are being saved in the root directory of my app.  Is this working as intended?  There are about 8 files one filename for example is <code>0fadc87e6e0b5ba2f3ba7fe15e4641c920150919-16509-1qkucnc</code> and they are all named the same except for the last 6 characters.  Here is my user.rb</p>  <pre><code>has_attached_file :avatar, :styles =&gt; { :large =&gt; "500x500&gt;",                     :profile =&gt; "300x300&gt;", :medium =&gt; "300x300&gt;",                     :thumb =&gt; "100x100&gt;", :small =&gt; "36x36#",                     :mini =&gt; "26x26#" },                     :default_url =&gt; "/assets/logo.png",                     :url  =&gt; "/assets/users/:id/:style/:basename.:extension",                     :path =&gt; ":rails_root/public/assets/users/:id/:style/:basename.:extension"    validates_attachment_content_type :avatar,                           content_type: ["image/jpeg", "image/gif", "image/png"]   validates_attachment_size :avatar, :less_than =&gt; 5.megabytes </code></pre>  <p>I am also using cloud9</p>
