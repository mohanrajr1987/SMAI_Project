<p>I read <a href="http://hackerlabs.org/blog/2012/07/30/organizing-photos-with-duplicate-and-similarity-checking/" rel="nofollow">this article</a> about comparing between two photos and get similarities. </p>  <p>Assuming I have the same photo with different sizes (like thumbnail version and large photo) - how can i get the same fingerprint (any hash value of the image) from each photo? </p>  <p>I can use openCV or Image-Magic or any good algorithm to compute unique value from image regardless of the size.</p>
