<p>I have a JPG picture on which I'd like to perform some operations in order to use pattern recognition. The picture is being rotated and also some filters like color inversion, greyscale,.. are applied The program goes like this</p>  <pre><code>for(i=0;i&lt;360;i++){    rotate(pic,i);    foreach(filter as f){      f(pic);      recognize(pic);    } } </code></pre>  <p>In order to increase speed I'd like to have the source image loaded in RAM and then read from there. Is it possible? </p>
