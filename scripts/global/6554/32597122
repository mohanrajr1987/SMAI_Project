<p>Using imagemagick, I'm looking to add an expanded background color to an image. My source looks like this:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/wPeUcFf.png" alt="source image"></p>  <p>And this is the desired output (the background color will be white, but this is for clarity): <img src="http://i.imgur.com/Ikt85a6.png" alt="source image"></p>  <p>Step 1 seems to be filling the background with my desired color, but I can't find a way to remove the background <em>outside</em> the shape. This will also be a problem if the source image contains any of the desired background color already (because it will be made transparent).</p>  <p>Ideas?</p>
