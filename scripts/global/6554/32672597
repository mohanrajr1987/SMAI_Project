<p>When drawing an image with <a href="http://docs.wand-py.org/en/0.4.1/" rel="nofollow">Wand</a> the result looks jaggy. The example below has both a Bezier curve and some text. Both are not crisp.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/wbSPo.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/wbSPo.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>See Python code. You should be able to run this snippet:</p>  <pre><code>from wand.image import Image from wand.color import Color from wand.drawing import Drawing from wand.display import display      with Image(width=500, height=300, background=Color('lightblue'), resolution=288) as canvas:     with Drawing() as context:         points = [(40,10), # Start point                   (20,50), # First control                   (90,10), # Second control                   (70,40)] # End point          context.bezier(points)         context.font_size = 28         context.text(x=25,                      y=75,                      body="Hello World!")         context(canvas)         canvas.format = "png"         display(canvas) </code></pre>  <p>Does anybody have an idea how the font and curve can look much sharper? Antialiasing is not the answer. I used both a curve and font to demonstrate that it is not caused by either curve of font. But probably by the canvas. I pretty much tried everything. </p>  <p>I have used Ruby with rmagick previously and that looked fine. So I know it is possible</p>  <p>Ruby with rmagick. Taken out of context looks something like this</p>  <pre><code>def write_text(image, text, x, y, bold, pointsize)     title = Magick::Draw.new     if bold == 1       font = 'FunctionPro-Bold'     else       font = 'FunctionPro-Light'     end     title.annotate(image, 0, 0, x, y, text) {       self.font_family = 'FunctionPro family'       self.font = font       self.fill = '#515151'       self.stroke = 'transparent'       self.pointsize = pointsize       self.gravity = Magick::SouthWestGravity     }   end </code></pre>  <p>I create these images <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/AqL3v.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/AqL3v.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Point being that ImageMagick seems perfectly able to render sharp fonts and such. So my assumption it is somewhere in either the binding of ImageMagick (Wand vs rmagick) or my use of the code. And I hope it is the latter.</p>
