<p>Several months ago, a decommissioned Solaris 5.6 box died at work before I could get a backup of it. One of this machine's primary purposes when it was in production involved taking a PDF (v1.3), generating separate Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black images, and displaying those images in a simple web page. This box had been decommissioned 18 months prior, but it was still on. I now have a need to reproduce this capability on a modern linux box.</p>  <p>I've tried</p>  <pre><code> gs -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sDEVICE=tiffsep -sOutputFile=CMYK-%d.pdf CMYKPDF.pdf </code></pre>  <p>This is the closest I've gotten to outputting separate color images, but the outputs are gray, indicating how much ink should be deposited. I would like to have the output pictures in Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black, not their respective greyscale counterparts.</p>  <p>Imagemagick seemed promising but I didn't see how to generate separate CMYK images with that either.</p>
