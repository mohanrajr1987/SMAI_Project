<p>I'm currently using <a href="https://github.com/BradLarson/GPUImage" rel="nofollow">GPUImage</a> to change the color(RGB) channels of images to produce "filter like" effects. The values I use for GPUImage are the X,Y values of the points of the color curve tool in photoshop. So for example I might have these points:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><strong>Photoshop curve tool</strong> <em>!please note that the image doesn't represent   the current data points</em>:<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/435397/Screen%20Shot%202015-10-02%20at%2013.57.26.png" alt="photoshop curve tool"></p>      <p><code>Red:       0,0       0.1176,0.0196       0.2275,0.098       0.3294,0.3333       0.4392,0.549       0.7451,0.8627       1,1   Green:       0,0       0.0784,0.0196       0.1961,0.2431       0.5176,0.5882       0.7451,0.8039       1,1   Blue:       0,0.2549       0.1569,0.3529       0.3333,0.451       0.8314,0.7255       1,0.8039   </code></p> </blockquote>  <p>GPUImage handles these points without problems, however since Imagemagick doesn't support direct input of these values I have to convert each channel points to the curve's expression like this:</p>  <p><code> Red: -237.407*u^6 + 634.277*u^5 - 615.934*u^4 + 261.501*u^3 - 44.054*u^2 + 2.617*u Green: -32.880*u^5 + 80.544*u^4 - 68.222*u^3 + 22.707*u^2 - 1.148*u Blue: -0.382*u^4 + 0.744*u^3 - 0.498*u^2 + 0.686*u + 0.255 </code> <strong>I am using the im_fx_curves.pl script found <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/color_mods/#curves" rel="nofollow">here</a> to convert the points to the expression.</strong></p>  <p>So my process would normally look like this:</p>  <p><code>convert test_image.png \ \( -channel Red -fx "`perl im_fx_curves.pl 0,0 0.1176,0.0196 0.2275,0.098 0.3294,0.3333 0.4392,0.549 0.7451,0.8627 1,1`" \) \ \( -channel Green -fx "`perl im_fx_curves.pl 0,0 0.0784,0.0196 0.1961,0.2431 0.5176,0.5882 0.7451,0.8039 1,1`" \) \ \( -channel Blue -fx "`perl im_fx_curves.pl 0,0.2549 0.1569,0.3529 0.3333,0.451 0.8314,0.7255 1,0.8039`" \) result.png</code></p>  <hr>  <p>However the results are slightly different. And I'm confused on why this is happening. I would gladly take any tips on what I might be doing wrong!</p>  <p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/435397/comparision.jpg" alt="result comparision"></p>
