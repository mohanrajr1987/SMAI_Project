<p>I need to calculate the length when rendered of a lot of strings using a custom font.  From a shell script and ImageMagick I am able to do something using the annotate command line option.</p>  <pre><code>convert -debug annotate xc: -font "customfont.ttf" -pointsize "25" -annotate 0 "this is the text" out.png </code></pre>  <p>And then reading the width of the rendered image. </p>  <p>Im struggling to understand how to do this with the python 'Wand' lib.  I have created a font object, but I seem to need to define the width of the canvas to paint the font onto.</p>  <p>Any suggestions appreciated.</p>
