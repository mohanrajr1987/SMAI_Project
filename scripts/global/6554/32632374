<p>I've created a folder action so that each time a new png file is dropped into the folder, using imagemagick the new file and an existing .png file inside of the folder are composited and saved as a new file.   Seems fairly simple.  I've tried the script just in terminal and it works but when in automator it doesn't seem to be firing...I'm assuming because of the "f"?   </p>  <p>The following is my automator "Run Shell Script" snippet:</p>  <pre><code>for f in "$@" do    /usr/local/bin/convert BG.png "$f" -composite result.jpg done </code></pre>
