<p>The following snipet works fine and creates tiles in the /sliced subfolder.</p>  <pre><code>FOR %%a in (C:\someFolder\*.png) DO (   ECHO Processing file: "%%~nxa"       convert %%a -crop 3x3@  +repage  +adjoin  %~dp0\sliced\%%~na.png )     </code></pre>  <p>However the numbering of the resulting tiles are ugly. Its in the following form: FileName-0.png, FileName-1.png, </p>  <p>I would like to make it start from 1 and use an underscore, like: FileName_1.png, FileName_2.png,  How can I do that?</p>
