<p>I am trying to apply a resize limit for ImageMagick but it does't seem to work as supposed in the <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/resize/#shrink" rel="nofollow">docs</a>. I am using <strong>ImageMagick 6.9.2-3-portable-Q16-x86</strong> in Windows 7.</p>  <pre><code>convert input.jpg -resize 1920x1080^&gt; -quality 92 output.jpg </code></pre>  <p>When the input file is larger that 1920x1080, it gets resized nicely.</p>  <p>When the input file is smaller, e.g. 1024x768, although I would expect it to be untouched, it does get saved with the same resolution (1024x768) and different file size, depending on the quality set.</p>  <p>Shouldn't parameter <code>-resize 1920x1080^&gt;</code> force ImageMagick to skip that file? </p>  <p>If not, then how can we skip those files that are smaller than the resize limit set?</p>
