<p>The following command:</p>  <pre><code> convert -size 96x96 canvas:transparent -fill red -draw "circle 48,48 48,0" output.png </code></pre>  <p>draws the following image:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/RSLMA.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/RSLMA.png" alt="off-center"></a></p>  <p>If you observe the right and bottom sides, you will see that the circle is slightly clipped at the image's edges.</p>  <p>On the top and left edge, it is flush to the image's boundaries.</p>  <p>I am struggling to get a result where the circle's boundaries correspond perfectly to those of the image, with no clipping occurring.</p>  <p>This is what it should look like (image created in Photoshop):</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/0Aiap.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/0Aiap.png" alt="correct"></a></p>  <p>No permutation of the parameters seems to improve the result, and I'm confused as to why this is occurring at all.</p>  <p>How can this be achieved?</p>
