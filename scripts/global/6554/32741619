<p>I am developing a DAM which is hosted in AWS. The user is able to upload heavy files to the system. Under the hood, when an image is uploaded, there is an AWS Lambda function creating a thumbnail for each image.</p>  <p>Obviously files with format .psd and .eps cannot be displayed on the browser with the typical HTML img item. That is why I will need to convert those file formats to .png or .jpg.</p>  <p>Maybe another solution would be to take a "screenshot on the fly" directly in .png. I do not know if this is possible.</p>  <p>The Node.js code running on the Lambda function is very similar the one here: <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/walkthrough-s3-events-adminuser-create-test-function-create-function.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/walkthrough-s3-events-adminuser-create-test-function-create-function.html</a></p>  <p>Thanks in advance for your help!!</p>
