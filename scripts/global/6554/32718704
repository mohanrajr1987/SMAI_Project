<p>I could create a less weight animated gif with same variables(colors, dither, etc) using the following function:</p>  <pre><code>convert -delay 4 -loop 0 *.png -coalesce -matte -alpha remove -depth 8 -layers optimizeFrame -colors 128 animated.gif </code></pre>  <p>But there is a Photoshop function called "Includes transparency based on color opacity" that loose a lot of weight, and I can't find an Image Magick equivalent function.</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
