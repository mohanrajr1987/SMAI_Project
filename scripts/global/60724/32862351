<p>I have a web-app where a log4j.xml has been defined which specifies an appender to output to console only. This web-app is being deployed in Tomcat7 in WIndows environment. I need to include a log4j.xml which would specify appenders to output to the console as well as a file. I have created the log4j.xml and placed it in the conf folder for the same and have followed the steps to bootstrap log4j to tomcat. <br /><strong>PROBLEM:</strong><br> I have tried modifying the catalina.bat file to update <strong>LOGGING_CONFIG</strong> to look up <strong>CATALINA_HOME/conf/log4j.xml</strong> but it did not work.I am unable to configure tomcat to pick the log4j in the conf folder. It always picks the one in the web-app. I was able to get some more info on the problem by including the below lines in catalina.bat file.</p>  <pre><code>rem To get details on the instiation of the log4j set JAVA_OPTS=-Dlog4j.debug </code></pre>  <p>It gave me the below output </p>  <pre><code>log4j: Trying to find [log4j.xml] using context classloader WebappClassLoader   context:   delegate: false   repositories:     /WEB-INF/classes/ ----------&gt; Parent Classloader: org.apache.catalina.loader.StandardClassLoader@7daf6ecc . log4j: Using URL [file:/C:/whp-tomcat-7/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/classes/log4j.xml] for automatic log4j configuration. </code></pre>  <p>I figured that it has something to do with the way the the log4j class loader looks up for log4j.xml. Can somebody please help me defining the heirarchy so that I am able to configure Tomcat to pick up the log4j.xml from the conf folder at catalina home?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
