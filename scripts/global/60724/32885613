<p>I work with Orbeon Form Builder. I had created a form with the builder interface and I had published it. Now I want to find the file <code>myform_created_with_builderINterface.xhtml</code> but I don't know where the path of it to edit it.</p>  <p>I need this file because I would like to edit and implement some XML request and I don't know how I can proceed to make it work.</p>  <p>Where is the file of the form that I have created before with the builder?</p>
