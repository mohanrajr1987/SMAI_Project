<p>I have a Java servlet that calls to an API using Apache's various libraries. I have each of those JARs in the WEB-INF/lib directory, however when I compile my code in the WEB-INF/classes directory that holds my servlets, it shows:</p>  <pre><code>GrooveAPICall.java:10: error: package org.apache.http does not exist </code></pre>  <p>as well as for each of the other packages I tried to import. How can I import these packages for my servlet? Is there something I have to put in the web.xml file?</p>
