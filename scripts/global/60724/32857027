<p>I am working on a java wen application which was deployed at root in <code>Tomcat's /webapp/ROOT</code> directory. while running tomcat from Eclipse <code>tomcat</code> provided a context path as <code>/myApp</code> but when I click on any link or button which creates another request context path is not added to the link. Please share your thoughts how can I add new context path to every request at once.</p>
