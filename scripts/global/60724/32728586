<p>We have a script that deploys tomcat apps using the manager app. This works fine in 7.0.52 but not in 7.0.53 or newer.</p>  <pre><code>  manager/text/deploy?path=/\&amp;war=.../ROOT.war </code></pre>  <p>gives the error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>"FAIL - Failed to deploy application at context path /"</p> </blockquote>  <p>If I change autoDeploy to true it deploys fine. If I change command to </p>  <pre><code> manager/text/deploy?path=/\&amp;war=.../myapp.war </code></pre>  <p>it deploys fine and creates a ROOT.war file.</p>  <h2>Question</h2>  <p>Why can't I deploy a war file called ROOT.war using manager app any more? Instead I have to have a duplicate war file called something else.</p>
