<p>I am starting a Java Application with Spring support using this command:</p>  <pre><code> mvn tomcat7:run </code></pre>  <p>And found it is very very slow in centos7. It is taking more than 10 mins to fully start up and this is output:</p>  <p>At least one JAR was scanned for TLDs yet contained no TLDs. Enable debug logging for this logger for a complete list of JARs that were scanned but no TLDs were found in them. </p>  <p>Skipping unneeded JARs during scanning can improve startup time and JSP compilation time.</p>  <p>Sorry, I don't understand how to handle this and how to fix this. The app was using Spring Saml plugin.</p>  <p>Any idea how to make this process faster?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
