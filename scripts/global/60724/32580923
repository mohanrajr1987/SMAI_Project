<p>I can't seem to add an existing JSP project to Tomcat since I've moved to my new machine. I've been reading web help for days, seems to be a common recommendation to go into Project > Properties > Project Facets > check Dynamic Web Module. I can't see this Dynamic Web Module, I've followed instructions and added eclipse software to enable this but I still can't see this. <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/xHtpd.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/xHtpd.png" alt="Below is a screenshot of the Project Facets"></a></p>  <p>Any help or advice appreciated.</p>
