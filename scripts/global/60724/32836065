<p>I have 2 java Web applications that i need to run on the windows 2008 server using tomcat as a  service. The first one works fine but when i run the 2nd app i get the below classloader error:</p>  <p>java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: Native Library <code>D:\ProgramFiles\apache-tomcat-7.0.57\bin\jacob-1.14.3-x64.dll</code> already loaded in another classloader</p>  <p>I have tried the below solutions: Copied the <code>.dll</code> file in Tomcat7.0/bin and also placed the <code>jacob.jar</code> file in the <code>Tomcat7.0/lib</code> and also set the java library path as well.</p>  <p>But there seems to be the something that's missing. Appreciate any answers for the question.</p>
