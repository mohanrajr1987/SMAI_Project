<p>Has anyone figured out how to make Tomcat 7 support SSL connections to iOS 9 apps without configuring an NSAppTransportSecurity exception in the app?</p>  <p>I know that iOS 9 requires TLSv1.2 and Forward Secrecy. In my server.xml file I tried removing all the references to older versions of TLS and for the ciphers I listed only the ECDHE variants, which I believe support forward secrecy. This not only failed to allow the iOS app to connect, but it also prevented Chrome and Safari from making an SSL connection to the same server.</p>  <p>Will it help if I upgrade to Tomcat 8?</p>  <p>Do I need a different version of Java and/or some add-on to Java? I'm currently using Java 1.7.0_85, which is what comes with Amazon's default Linux AMI and seems to be the latest version available.</p>  <p>Could the problem have anything to do with my certificate? It is a wildcard cert that I obtained from GoDaddy in May, so it is relatively new.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
