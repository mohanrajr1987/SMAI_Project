<p>Because Tomcat tells us to have the mysql-connector-java in its lib/ directory, so that it can handle multiple projects, I had my dependency as provided:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;dependency&gt;   &lt;groupId&gt;mysql&lt;/groupId&gt;   &lt;artifactId&gt;mysql-connector-java&lt;/artifactId&gt;   &lt;version&gt;5.1.36&lt;/version&gt;   &lt;scope&gt;provided&lt;/scope&gt; &lt;/dependency&gt; </code></pre>  <p>And I extracted the jar archive mysql-connector-java-x.x.x-bin.jar from the downloaded dependency and copied it into the lib folder of the Tomcat server:</p>  <pre><code>cp ~/.m2/repository/mysql/mysql-connector-java/5.1.36/mysql-connector-java-5.1.36.jar lib/ </code></pre>  <p>But when I now run a build the tests phase fails since it cannot connect to the data store.</p>  <p>The build would succeed if commenting out the provided scope.</p>  <p>There must be a simple way around this...</p>
