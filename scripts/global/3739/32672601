<p>I have written a client application in C++ using websockets in Unix Environment trying to connect a Node.js/Socket.IO server running in a LAN connectivity. I found the server application is not responding at all. I tried a couple of other options from client side eventually getting no response from the server. Basically, i am trying to send a JSON object to the system running SocketIO server, but the client is not getting connected even if the server listens on to a Port. Help, is really appreciated. Thank you.</p>
