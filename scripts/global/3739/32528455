<p>I've made a simple client-server application in Python, but after 3 messages from the client, the server just stops displaying them. And when the client closes the connections, the server spams empty input. Can anybody tell me why?</p>  <p>Server.py</p>  <pre><code>import socket import threading  bind_ip = "127.0.0.1" bind_port = 4443  server = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) server.bind((bind_ip, bind_port)) server.listen(10)  print "[*] Listening on %s:%d" % (bind_ip, bind_port)  # Ths is our thread for handling clients def handle_client(client_socket, address):     running = True     while running:         # Print out what the client sends to us.         request = client_socket.recv(1024)         print "[*] Data received from %s: %s " % (address[0], request)          if request == 'shutdown':             running = False      client_socket.send("Closing server. Bye.")     client_socket.close()     print 'Server not available for new connections.'  while True:     client, addr = server.accept()     print '[*] Accepted incoming connection from: %s:%d' %       (addr[0],addr[1])     client.send("You're now connected! Enjoy.")      # Spin up our client thread to handle incoming data     client_handler = threading.Thread(target=handle_client, args=(client,      addr)) client_handler.start() </code></pre>  <p>Client.py</p>  <pre><code>import socket  target_host = "127.0.0.1" target_port = 4443  # Create a socket object client = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)  # Connect the client client.connect((target_host, target_port))  while True:     # Read some input from the keyboard     msg = raw_input()      client.send(msg)      # Receive some data     response = client.recv(1024)      print response </code></pre>
