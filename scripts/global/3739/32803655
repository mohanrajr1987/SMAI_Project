<p>This is technically a csrf attack but this time I am trying to prevent the requests from the user no matter if they are unintentional or not.</p>  <p>I have a cloud storage service where a user can perform CRUD operations on files. I would like to exclusive limit this functionality to my site. So that they could not say, forge a request via postman or cURL and use the service through those methods.</p>
