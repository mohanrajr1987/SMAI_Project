<p>Say I have 3 client machines A,B,C which are connected to Internet and are having Microsoft OS. And I have a server X which has Windows Server 2008 R2. I want to create an architecture where all 3 clients will have a folder which is accessible to the server. I want to know if there is any way where I can send a csv file to the client machine shared folder and open it using excel from Server X?</p>  <p>I have used <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-in/sysinternals/bb897553.aspx" rel="nofollow">PSexec</a> tool but I guess it requires credentials. If its possible through PSExec, please tell me how. If not, what is the other best way to achieve this?</p>  <p>Also note that, the 3 clients do not have static IP address, but as they are connected to server by an application, I can have their dynamic IP addresses. On the other hand, my server has Static IP.</p>  <p>I am open to all programming languages.</p>
