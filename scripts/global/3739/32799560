<p>Say I have a server where anyone can upload a script that other users can interact with. During this interaction the script can create requests to the server to manipulate files (CRUD). However the manipulation should strictly be limited to the path that the file initially originated from, so that other files that are served from the same domain cannot write to paths other than their own.Strangely I would not be authenticating on a per user basis, but on a per script/file that originated the request basis. </p>  <p>Say I somehow assigned a name to every script that lived on the server and every time it attempted to manipulate a file, its name was given, would there be anyway to validate their identity?</p>  <p>Take note that they could not pass any type of confidential information such as a password since it is visible to anyone using the script.</p>
