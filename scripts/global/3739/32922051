<p>I am a little confused and need some help.  How can i send information from a web site (it is live on a server) to my laptop (os: ubuntu)?  I want to click a button on my website and send a signal to ubuntu in order to start or stop a process. </p>  <p>I have  already tried to connect those two machines with TCP socket , but it didn't work.</p>  <p>Is there any other way to make those two machines communicate?</p>  <p>Could anyone help please?  </p>
