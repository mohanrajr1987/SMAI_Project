<p>I've stumbled over an interesting puzzle. I am programming a small family web-site, where I'll be showing photos with additional information. For the sake of speed and simpler programming, for editing, I've decided to use a desktop client application (so a few people will use it to edit information, and the rest of the family will just browse the site to view it). With the web-page the photos are just obtained via URL, something like <code>/jpeg/filename.jpg</code>. The filename is served by PHP from a MqSQL database via AJAX. It works fine. But am I right that since it involves HTTP and the JPEG files are transferred base64-encoded? If so, could I make my desktop client 37 % faster if I transfer images in the binary form? If so, what is the good practice way to do it? Thanks.</p>
