<p>I have a XAMPP-Server running on my PC and I want to connect it with an Android App. So I have tried to call the IP-Address like in this answer with the webbrowser in my device:</p>  <pre><code>http://stackoverflow.com/a/20480023/3836142 </code></pre>  <p>But I am getting the error that the adress is unreachable. But when I'm going to the same IP-Adress with my webbrowser on my PC I see the XAMPP-startpage.</p>  <p>The android-device and my PC are in the same network (= the same WLAN). </p>
