<p>WebDriver is upgraded version of Selenium RC (Remote Control). I want to make sure that like RC it is or it's not a two tier Client-Server architecture.</p>  <p>If it is, </p>  <ol> <li>how it is setting up the server and which we are calling the client. </li> <li>What role does browser (<code>WebDriver driver = new FirefoxBrowser();</code>) play in this architecture.</li> </ol>
