<p>I'm using Netty to implement a TCP server and I'm having a really weird problem :</p>  <p>Netty is throwing a "Connection reset by peer" exception in the exceptionCaught method and then closing the connection :</p>  <pre><code>@Override     public void exceptionCaught(ChannelHandlerContext ctx, Throwable cause) {         logger.info("client disconnected ");         logger.info(cause.getMessage());          ctx.close();      } </code></pre>  <p>Then the channelUnregistered method is called :</p>  <pre><code>@Override     public void channelUnregistered(ChannelHandlerContext ctx) {         logger.info("client disconnected  ");     }  </code></pre>  <p>But the client is still able to send messages and seems to be always connected (although I'm sure that the channel is really closed)</p>  <pre><code>2015-09-22 06:03:01 INFO  ChannelInboundHandlerAdapter:44 - RAW DATA:Message </code></pre>  <p>And the channelRegistered is never called :</p>  <pre><code>@Override     public void channelRegistered(ChannelHandlerContext ctx) {         logger.info("client connected  ");     } </code></pre>  <p>I'm really confused because the client seems to be be unaware of the connection closing and the server is acting like the client was always connected although I'm sure that the channel was closed..</p>  <p>Any help will be appreciated..</p>
