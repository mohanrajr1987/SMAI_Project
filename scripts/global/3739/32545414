<p>My issue is as follows. I have a server-client type model.</p>  <p>At the server side, I have a master taking in charge of N server-established workers doing some task, where N here is a constant. Meanwhile, at the client side, one can start a worker to work together remotely by finding server's IP adrress. In my algorithm, each server-established worker is initially assigned a worker_ID (from 1 to N).  So I would like to let the master assign new worker_IDs (e.g. N+1, N+2 ) to the remote workers once they also start getting into the work.</p>  <p>Is there any way to realize this functionality?</p>
