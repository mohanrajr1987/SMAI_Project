<p>i'm planning on creating a system that has 2 parts, the first part will be found in the client side while the other part is in the server side. there are 2 different programs here running, the client side will save a data in the database and raise a flag or a trigger which will then be the cause for the server side part to start and retrieve data from the database and process it in an API.</p>  <p>at first i decided on using a scheduler on the server side to continuously run the program and check for any changes in the database using a "status" field, but then this is not that efficient as it would be wasteful to always check for changes.</p>  <p>thus i was hoping you can help me out in finding a different solution to my problem here so that i may do this more efficiently</p>
