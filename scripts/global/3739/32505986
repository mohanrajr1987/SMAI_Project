<p><strong>System Overview:</strong> Client on Ubuntu     </p>  <p><strong>SDK/Language :</strong>  QT/C++</p>  <p><strong>Restriction</strong>: Cannot access server code.</p>  <p><strong>Problem:</strong><br>  I need to poll server from client at regular interval and expect server to respond back with response message. The expected message is quite long string.</p>  <p><strong>Description :</strong><br> I have already implemented Qt Client that establish connection with non-qt server. The  software  is single threaded on both client and server &amp; works as expected.It means  User ask client  to send some request command to server and server response back. Now with that I need to poll server at regular interval to ask for its status information.  I am looking for suggestion on how to implement that.<em>[ Note : I am not looking for source code but just bit fo hint and tools or libraries to use]</em></p>  <p>There are few options which I thought</p>  <p><strong>1)</strong> <em>Use for loop in code with QTimer that sends status_request to server and server response back</em></p>  <p>*****DisAdv:*****<br> i) what will happen if user and New loop send query at same time.?    </p>  <p>ii) Is it possible that for loop will eat up all resources?  </p>  <p><strong><em>2)</em></strong> Use different thread for polling ? what you guys think about that? With current requirement do you think introducing new thread is a good idea?    </p>  <p><strong>3)</strong> Any other better and feasible solution?</p>
