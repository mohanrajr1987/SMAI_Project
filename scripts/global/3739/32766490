<p>I am looking for recommendations on how to design an application like SoundCloud.</p>  <p>I am planning to develop an application that will be available across multiple platforms. I want to start developing for Android because that's what I am most comfortable with. The best example I can give ye to show what I want is an application like SoundCloud.</p>  <p>I am looking for advice on how to design such an application. So far I have a "Sign up with Google" button on one of my activities. New users would click this button to register with their Google account information. I also created a Google Developers Console project for this application.</p>  <p>(1) After retrieving the users basic profile information which will be used to create on account for them, where would I save it? My thoughts on this were to use Amazon Web Service or Google Cloud Messaging and use their virtual servers.</p>  <p>(2) What service is better for a SoundCloud-like application, Amazon Web Service or Google Cloud Messaging?</p>  <p>(3) My thoughts so far is that I'll have to develop my own API to interact with my servers. Where would the API code be stored?</p>
