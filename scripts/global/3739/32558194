<p>My question is a follow up on this one - </p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3295309/simple-c-sharp-screen-sharing-application">Simple C# Screen sharing application</a></p>  <p>Most answers demonstrate how to take screen shots and then all that needs to be done is to compress them and send over the wire. Of course, this must be very trivial. But being a noob, I'm not sure how to do it. Can some one please give me some pointers? I want to send the screen shots to the server and then display them on another client.</p>
