<p>I am building a c#/wpf project. It's architecture is this:</p>  <ul> <li>A console application which will be on a virtual machine (or my home computer) that will be the server side.</li> <li>A wpf application that will be the client app.</li> </ul>  <p>Now my problem is this - I want the server to be able to send changes to the clients. If for example I have a change for client ABC, I want the server to know how to call a service on the clients computer. The problem is, that I don't know how the server will call the clients.</p>  <p>A small example in case I didn't explain it well: The server is on computer 1, and there are two clients, on computers 2 and 3. Client 2 has a Toyota car and client 3 has a BMW car. The server on computer 1 wants to tell client 2 that it has a new car, an Avenger.</p>  <p>How do I keep track and call services on the clients? I thought of saving their ip address (from calling ipconfig from the cmd) in the DB - but isn't that based on the WI-FI/network they are connected to?</p>  <p>Thanks for any help!</p>
