<p>I am trying to write a simple client-server application where a client can send or broadcast a message to one or all clients in the network. The server stores all IP addresses that are connected to it, and broadcasts a new IP if a new client connects itself.</p>  <p>I'm not quite sure how to implement the sending of a single message to another client. Would I just have to send a TCP message to the server and put the desired recipient as data in the TCP layer which is then extracted by the server so it knows where to send it?</p>  <p>I also want to add encryption to the messages which would then no longer allow the server to read the data, so I'm not sure how to solve that!?</p>  <p>I am using c++ and Qt5 for the implementation</p>
