<p>I am trying hard to figure out to how get the current temperature of a particular region. Is there any built in class in java that helps me to do that with less effort?</p>  <p>For example the yahoo server stores the <code>temp</code> of different region. And I want to display the <code>temp</code> of Delhi in my console (converted from centigrade to Farenheit).</p>  <pre><code> package temp  public class Temp {      public static void main(String[] args) {   //display the current temp  System.out.println(temp);      }  } </code></pre>
