<p>I want to realize a digital signage via Xibo software on some TV screens. I've downloaded xibo-server-170-rc1.tar, xibo-client-1.7.4-win32-x86 and installed Xibo. However, I've inserted nothing in CMS Address and key when Xibo Player Options window has opened although I gave some admin user key during an installation. Then I've tried to add a display IP and Mac Address. However,as it is possible only from the client side, I have started to install Xibo client server on another computer. But I don't know what I must insert as a CMS address and key by a side of client. (I've not done it also by a side of server)</p>  <p>I'm a new in Xibo topic. Will be glad for any help.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
