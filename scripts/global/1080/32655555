<p>From a list of points , in a 2D plane , i want to get a list of arc and segments.</p>  <p>The list of points is an offset of a profile composed by arcs and segments.  The generated points have a fixed maximum chord error.</p>  <p>Currently i start with 4 consecutive points , then gradually i add the next points if they are compatible with current arc dimension.</p>  <p>I pass every point through a series of method to check for example if the point lie on circumference ( within a range value proportional to diameter ) , or if have a compatible angular distance with previous point. And so on.</p>  <p>It's not a reliable method.</p>  <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwVEE9bSpaeNcGxtajk5aDdXcVU/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">Point List Example</a></p>
