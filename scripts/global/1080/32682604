<p>I have a set of 2D points/coordinates and I need that a certain minimum distance is respected between all pair of points. Also, each point is associated with some information that I would like to maintain, maybe merging that information with other information contained in other points. </p>  <p>The thing is that I have to create a new set where that minimum distance is respected between all pair of points and the least Information has been lost.</p>  <p>I can't think of an algorithm or method that solves this problem in any temporal cost.</p>  <p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
