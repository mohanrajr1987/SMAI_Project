<p>I have to write a program that takes two circles c1 and c2 and then finds the largest circle c that lies inside both c1 and c2 (the overlapped area, similar to a Venn diagram, but in any case of size). If the c1 and c2 are disjoint, display “disjoint” and do not attempt to find c. And I have to list the new circle both with its coordinates and its radius. This is using basic Java (things like If statements and geometry). I have the math idea, kind of, but it's been 10 years since I was in high school; I haven't a clue. </p>
