<p>I'm Trying to implement 3-plane intersection using the formula at the bottom of this wolfram page here: <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Plane-PlaneIntersection.html" rel="nofollow">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Plane-PlaneIntersection.html</a></p>  <pre><code>If the three planes are each specified by a point xk and a unit normal vector      nk, then the unique point of intersection  x is given by  x = (|n1 n2 n3|)^(-1) [(x1 路 n1)(n2 x n3)+(x2 路 n2)(n3 x n1)+(x3 路 n3)(n3 x n2)],     where |n1 n2 n3| is the determinant of the matrix formed by writing the  vectors ni side-by-side. If two of the planes are parallel, then  |n1 n2 n3| = 0,  </code></pre>  <p>But this is as far as I can get, my matrix math is awful and I'm not that good with three.js matrices</p>  <pre><code>var x1, x2, x3; // all clones var n1, n2, n3; // all clones, normalized  var f1 = (x1.dot(n1)).something(n2.cross(n3)); var f2 = (x2.dot(n2)).something(n3.cross(n1)); var f3 = (x3.dot(n3)).something(n1.cross(n2));  var full = f1.add(f2).add(f3); </code></pre>  <p>First off, what is '(x1 路 n1)(n2 x n3)' supposed to mean? I know the first one is dot product and the section is cross product, what do I do to combine them</p>  <p>Second, how do I write the matrix portion in three.js</p>
