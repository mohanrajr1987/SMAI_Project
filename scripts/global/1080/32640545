<p>I have been researching a bit the API of mongodb's geospatial types/indices and it induced a tad of confusion in me.</p>  <p>2d should be for euclidean + flat 2d space, right? They seem to use the terms latitude/longitude within their specifications for this. Is this on purpose?</p>  <p>Intersection seems to be currently only supported by 2dsphere. Is there something like that for 2d? Is there a trick I am missing that is doable in 2d and not in 2dsphere that enables intersections?</p>  <p>To be more precise about my specific problem: I want to intersect a set rectangles in a preferably easy way.</p>
