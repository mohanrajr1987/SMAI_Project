<p>I am building a web-based game where a mobile phone is used to control a player's cursor on a desktop app. Using the <code>window.orientation</code> event values the screen is "mapped" to a coordinate space so that a subset of phone rotation will map to the entire screen.</p>  <p>I'm experiencing a problem with Chrome on Android orientation values when a device is rotated - this problem does not exist on iOS browsers where values are as expected.</p>  <hr>  <p>on iOS browsers (the expected outcome):</p>  <p>The phone's rotation (<code>gammma value</code>) does not effect the <code>alpha</code> and <code>beta</code> values - so the phone's X &amp; Y coordinates are unaffected by the angle in which a device is held.</p>  <p>on Android browsers:</p>  <p>The <code>alpha</code> and <code>beta</code> values "jump" by 180 degrees when the phone's <code>gamma</code> rotation surpasses 90 degrees (when the phone is sideways).</p>  <hr>  <p>This problem can be illustrated by looking at the orientation values in the <a href="https://richtr.github.io/Full-Tilt/examples/data_display.html" rel="nofollow">Full Tilt Data Display</a> example</p>  <p>On Android values will be the same, on iOS the adjusted values differ from the original ones - I am actually interested in converting Android values to the original iOS value ranges.</p>
