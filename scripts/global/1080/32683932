<p>I need to test contour on self-intersection but I don't know how it implement. Or how I can detect only contours without self-intersection in cv::Mat?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/xE3W0.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/xE3W0.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>F.ex. left contour must be matched, right contour don't matched</p>
