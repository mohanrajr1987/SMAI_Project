<p>I'm trying to suss out the best approach to creating geometry symbols for a website. Most of the normal things are easy (degrees, etc.) and have Unicode representations. However, I need to do rays and lines which have a directional arrow over the letters of the ray indicating origin and direction or a double-ended arrow indicating a line. </p>  <pre><code>                       --&gt;     &lt;--&gt;                         AB       AB </code></pre>  <p>After having spent a few hours Googling, the best approach seems to be to just insert a graphic image, but that makes for a somewhat sloppy looking text flow.</p>  <p>Are there any other approaches to rendering that sort of combination character?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
