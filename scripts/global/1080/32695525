Means I have the list of points for draw this type of polygon.</p>  <p>Below image showing two polygon intersect or overlapping each other. Now I am searching for a solution how to find two polygon "intersect or not" using java? I am using pure java programming without using any third library.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/W9Jpz.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/W9Jpz.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I have another issue.
