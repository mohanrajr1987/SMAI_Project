<p>I'm currently working on optimizing my working implementation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune%27s_algorithm" rel="nofollow">Fortune's algorithm</a>, an algorithm used to generate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram" rel="nofollow">Voronoi diagrams</a>, and I was wondering if the average <strong>or</strong> max number of intersection-events (also called circle-events) was known, for <code>n</code> seeds (i.e. the input points.)</p>  <p>Are these values known for some <code>n</code>? If so, what are they?</p>  <p><sub>Also, as a meta question not worthy of a full post on meta, should this be asked on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>, <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/">Mathematics</a>, or <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/">Programmers</a>?</sub></p>
