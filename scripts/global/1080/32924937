<p>I'm having some issues finding a working formula on java to find the shaded area(shared area) between two 2D figures. Each figure is on a 100x100 matrix in which the user puts in the (x,y) coordenates in which they will be. All figures have area, side length, apothem, mid point, and perimeter. </p>  <p>Thanks in regards. </p>
