<p>I have the following plot generated using Matlab. The Red lines are generated using the Voronoi function and the black rectangular box using rectangle function.</p>  <p>(1) I want to get the coordinates of the polygons inside the rectangles (coordinates in clockwise or ccw direction)  Matlab code given below:</p>  <pre><code>a=12.5e-3; b=30e-3; vcellsx=[0.0105089656997958,0.00245744063039010,0.00770055845183299,0.00439574383828746,0.00946500286388402]; vcellsy=[0.00762846536914593,0.00753251573928093,0.0141986654670819,0.0249248588368887,0.0226118728283549];  [vx,vy]=voronoi(vcellsx,vcellsy); plot(vx,vy,'r-','LineWidth', 2);  hold on rectangle('Position',[0 0 a b]) </code></pre>  <p>[edit]  I am looking for coordinates of the domains as shown in the figure.  <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzxYGJhdC2A4Vl9jUTVDU204NEk/view" rel="nofollow">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzxYGJhdC2A4Vl9jUTVDU204NEk/view</a></p>
