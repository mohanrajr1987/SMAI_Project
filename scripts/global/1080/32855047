<p>I have a Cartesian rectangular grid defined as:</p>  <pre><code>x_0, x_1, ..., x_(ni-1) y_0, y_1, ..., y_(nj-1) z_0, z_1, ..., z_(nk-1) </code></pre>  <p>In this 3D grid, a closed triangulated surface is immersed. My goal is to find the boundary cells that have intersections with the triangulated surface. I was thinking of using a signed distance function and by setting the following criteria, identify those which are intersected by the surface:</p>  <pre><code>abs(d) &lt;= sqrt( dx*dx + dy*dy + dz*dz) </code></pre>  <p>where <code>d</code> is the signed distance function, and <code>dx</code>, <code>dy</code>, <code>dz</code> are the grid spacing in <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>z</code> direction. May I know the community's thoughts on my approach? Thank you.</p>
