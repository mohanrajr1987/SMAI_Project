<p>I am searching online for an efficient method that can intersect a Cartesian rectangular 3D grid with a close irregular 3D surface which is triangulated. </p>  <p>This surface is represented is a set of vertices, <code>V</code>, and a set of faces, <code>F</code>. The Cartesian rectangular grid is stored as:</p>  <pre><code>x_0, x_1, ..., x_(ni-1) y_0, y_1, ..., y_(nj-1) z_0, z_1, ..., z_(nk-1) </code></pre>  <p>In the figure below, a single cell of the Cartesian grid is shown. In addition, two triangles of the surface is schematically shown. This intersection is shown by a dotted red lines with the solid red circles the intersection points with this particular cell. My goal is to find the points of intersection of the surface with the edges of the cells, which can be non-planar. </p>  <p>I will implement in either MATLAB, C, or C++.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/IN0Tk.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/IN0Tk.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
