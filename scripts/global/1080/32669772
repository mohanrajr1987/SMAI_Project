<p>How do I find vertices positions of a mesh after I used <code>.fromGeometry();</code> code? I created a buffergeometry from a geomtery that I used for a mesh. Here is an example. </p>  <pre><code>var geom = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1,1,1); var buffgeom = new THREE.BufferGeometry(); buffgeom.fromGeometry(geom); var mat = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x0000ff }); var cube = new THREE.Mesh(buffgeom, mat);  geometryvertices.vertices = buffgeom.vertices; </code></pre>  <p>The <code>geometryvertices.vertices = buffgeom.vertices;</code> code doesn't work for <code>buffgeom</code>. How do I find vertices positions of <code>buffgeom</code>? Can somebody please help?</p>  <p>After that I want to push the vertices of a geometry into <code>THREE.Vector3</code>. This is how it worked with a geometry. </p>  <pre><code>geom.vertices.push(Vector3); </code></pre>  <p>And it doesn't work with a buffergeometry.</p>
