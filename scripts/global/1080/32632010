<p>I'm having a hard time figuring out the trigonometry for the following; I need to draw the outline of a circle with an opening in it of certain pixels in width. The circle can be of various radius but the opening should always be of the same size. In other words if the radius (r) is known and gap width (w) is known, how do you get the gap angle (a)?</p>  <p>I wish I could append an image but I'm not allowed as I don't have enough reputation points.</p>
