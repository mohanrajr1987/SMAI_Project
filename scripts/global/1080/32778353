<p>here's the thing: I have 8 points / vertices in a 3D volume.  I want to know if a point x is contained within the box whose vertices are given by the 8 points. </p>  <p>Moreover, I know that 4 points lie on a plane parallel (let's call it A) to the y axes, and the other 4 points also lie on another plane parallel (B) to the y axes. </p>  <p>So given A and B, which are the 4x3 matrices of the vertices.</p>  <p>I compute the lines joining the two pair of vertices with lie on the boundary hyperplane of the box </p>  <pre><code>    LinesJoiningVertices =              [A(2,:) - A(1,:), B(1,:) - A(1,:);              A(1,:) - A(1,:), A(4,:) - A(1,:);              A(3,:) - A(4,:), B(4,:) - A(4,:);              A(2,:) - B(2,:), B(3,:) - B(2,:);              B(2,:) - B(1,:), B(4,:) - B(1,:);              A(1,:) - B(1,:), B(4,:) - B(1,:)] </code></pre>  <p>and I compute the normals of each boundary hyperplane</p>  <pre><code>   for i = 1:6        normals(i,:) = cross(LinesJoiningVertices(i,1:3), LinesJoiningVertices(i,4:6))    end </code></pre>  <p>Theoretically, a point x within the box should have a negative dot product with each normal (shouldn't it?).  Practically, it doesn't work. I take a point x I know to be within the box, and the answer is greater that 0 for the first, the third and the fifth normal. </p>  <p>Is there an error in my code?  Is there an error in my math? </p>
