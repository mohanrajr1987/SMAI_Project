<p>I have start working on merge orthogonal/non orthogonal shape and perform Boolean operation like merge,union, bloat, shrink. During of searching I found couple of thing and did not find proper answer.</p>  <ol> <li><p>Boost support Polygon library which support only 45 and 90 angle and does not support non orthogonal. is there any specific reason for not to support non orthogonal <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_57_0/libs/polygon/doc/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_57_0/libs/polygon/doc/index.htm</a></p>  <ol start="2"> <li><p>I start search on internet and found following Polygon library which claim   to support all shape but not able to found bloat,shrink function into this library. <a href="http://www.angusj.com/delphi/clipper.php#features" rel="nofollow">http://www.angusj.com/delphi/clipper.php#features</a></p></li> <li><p>I also would like to understand how boost polygon library perform option like bloat,shrink and trying to browse code but did not much information <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_57_0/boost/polygon/" rel="nofollow">http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_57_0/boost/polygon/</a></p></li> </ol></li> </ol>  <p>In brief, I am completely new about polygon concept and was trying to understand in deeper way about polygon and his operation in boost or in general also. I am also trying to explore possibility if I can add support of non-orthogonal Polygon in boost polygon Any guidance will help me lot.</p>
