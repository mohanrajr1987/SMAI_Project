<p>I would like to add hour indicators to a circle created with xml. The indicators themselves are short lines (dashes rather) that are spaced 30 degrees apart. </p>  <p>Here is my circle:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt; &lt;shape xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"     android:shape="oval"&gt;      &lt;solid         android:color="#FFAABB"         /&gt;  &lt;/shape&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Is it possible to achieve a solution using xml ? This is not specifically intended for Android gear.</p>
