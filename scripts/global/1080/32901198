<p>I am searching for an algorithm which can shows line and arc intersected or not.  For line I have start and end point and for arc I have start, end and center point. I also have start and end angle of an ARC. </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/o3qJW.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/o3qJW.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>As you can see in the above image I have draw an arc and line where as both are intersected. How to calculate that intersected or not?</p>  <p>I found one link which can shows the intersection between line and circle <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13053061/circle-line-intersection-points">Circle Line Intersection points</a> but in my case I have line and arc. Even I also have another question what is best way to calculate the intersection between two ARC?</p>  <p>Any suggestion?</p>
