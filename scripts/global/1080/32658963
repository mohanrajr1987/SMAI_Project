<p>I have the following situation: Base point (green) and segments, for each segment his vertices represented as polar point with theta angle from base point.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5i7hp.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5i7hp.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>The problem: For each segment I have his 2 vertices theta's. Not ordered! I need just from this data to figure out the range of angles this segment overlaps. For example for the 2 vertices {20,300} belonging to the top segment, the correct answer is all angles from 300 to 20 and NOT from 20 to 300.</p>  <p>The direction is from 0 to 359 and as seen in the example it's cyclic.</p>  <p>EDIT: Assumption - Maximum overlap angle for Segment is less then 180, which means 179. </p>  <p>I think the solution is just to find the "right conditions" for the <code>if</code>...</p>  <pre><code>class Node {     int theta;  //angle from base point e.g. 45     double radius;  //distance (in problem specific metric) from base point }  class Segment {     //nodes not ordered in any way     Node node_1;     Node node_2; }  List&lt;Segments&gt; allSegments = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); //populate allSegments...  Segment mSegment; for (int i=0; i&lt;allSegments.size(); i++) {     mSegment = allSegments.get(i);     if (TODO? mSegment.node_1.tetha ? mSegment.node_2.theta) {        //the order is from node_1 to node_2 or otherwise...     } } </code></pre>  <p>Thanks,</p>
