<p>I have two problem first how to calculate the minimum distance between two lines. For details I am attaching an image here.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5nTsx.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5nTsx.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>In the image describe the line with start and end point. I already have start and end point for both lines but I am not getting any idea how to calculate the minimum distance between two lines.</p>  <p>Another problem is that how to calculate the minimum distance between two arc.  I am attaching another image here</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/XbsKk.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/XbsKk.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>For arc I have the start, end and center point also I have the start and end angle.</p>  <p>This link has lot more things - <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/849211/shortest-distance-between-a-point-and-a-line-segment">Shortest distance between a point and a line segment</a></p>  <p>I also got help from above link.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/0XKCI.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/0XKCI.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>This is the another issue what I am facing now. In this scenario how to calculate minimum distance between two arc? </p>  <p>Any idea how solve this two issue?</p>
