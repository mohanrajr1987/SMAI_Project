<p>I have a 3D triangulated closed surface. This surface is immersed inside a rectangular Cartesian grid. The surface is stored in a STL format. My goal is to compute the fraction of the cells which are cut by the surface. In other words, when a cell has an intersection with surface and in fact is cut by it, it is divided into an interior and exterior sub cells. My aim is to find the volume fraction of the interior sub-cell and the cell cut by the surface. For example, in the picture below which shows a 2D case for illustration purposes, I want to compute the fraction of the cyan area to the total area (which is cyan+grey). </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/LH8jR.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/LH8jR.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Could someone help me find an efficient method/algorithm that can do this? I can do the implementation in either <code>MATLAB</code> or <code>C</code>.</p>
