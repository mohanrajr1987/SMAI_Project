<p>I have next issue. Admin panel have implemented with  akeneo in my project. . When turned between pages, these scripts added to page. How upload (remove) these scripts? Some page looks:</p>  <pre><code>require(     ['jquery', 'datepicker', 'oro/navigation'],     function ($, datepicker, Navigation) {         ...     } ); &lt;/script&gt; &lt;form class="form-inline" id="form-search"&gt;   ... &lt;/form&gt; </code></pre>  <p><strong>Edit:</strong> Akeneo version 1.2.0. I want remove excess scripts. I think it's connected with requirejs.</p>
