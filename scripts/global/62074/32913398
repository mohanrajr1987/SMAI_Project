<p>We're using the <code>lodash-contrib</code> package, which includes a <code>camelCase</code> method that behaves differently than the original <code>_.camelCase</code> method. </p>  <p>Is there any way for me to restore the pointer to the original method?</p>  <p>In the requirejs config, we have a shim:</p>  <pre><code>lodashContrib: ['lodash'] </code></pre>  <p>As soon as lodashContrib has loaded, it's added mixins to lodash. An example of our code:</p>  <pre><code>define([     'lodashContrib' ], function() {     // our code here. At this point, _.camelCase is overridden by contrib }); </code></pre>
