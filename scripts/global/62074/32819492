<p>I want a project accessible by both web and mobile Android app. Suppose I have required <code>b.js</code> in my project. And my <code>b.js</code> looks like:</p>  <p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false"> <div class="snippet-code"> <pre class="snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>require(['../c'], function(c){   //my code here })</code></pre> </div> </div> </p>  <p>In my Android app, the path to <code>c.js</code> will be <code>file://somepath/c.js</code>. Since <code>b.js</code> could be written by any clients of web and I have no possibility to upload <code>c.js</code> to my local mobile environment. Is there a way to get current requirejs(<code>b.js</code>) http path so that I can calculate the complete http path for its dependencies like <code>c.js</code>?</p>
