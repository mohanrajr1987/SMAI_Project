<p>I am having difficulty resolving the electron modules in my web application using Electron v0.32.3 using require.  My understanding (although its not very clear in the docs) is that the modules are supposed to be automatically available to require of the application being run in the webview (examples include 'ipc' and 'remote').  I can see that they are there at runtime, but I am not sure how to access them: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/o505S.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/o505S.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I feel like there is some piece to this that I am missing.  Other information: my web application is a Durandal 2x SPA that uses require to load modules already.  Is there any other kind of setup that is required in the render process requirejs config to access these modules?</p>
