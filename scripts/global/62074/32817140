<p>I've recently started to use <code>RequireJS</code>, which enables me to organize my code in  a nice way. So, <code>define</code> and <code>require</code> became my best friends. But now I see one problem, which I do not know how to solve in terms of <code>RequireJS</code>, or in terms of some particular Design Pattern. So, imagine, I have a really huge module containing zillions of methods. I define it like so:</p>  <pre><code>define(function(BIG_MODULE){     return {         property_0: "value_0",         property_1: "value_1",         ....         property_zillion: "value_zillion",         method_0: function(){...},         ...         method_zillion: function(){...}     } }); </code></pre>  <p>Please, do not ask me, why I have such a huge module - it's just an abstraction. And, so, the question now is - if it is possible to import or <code>require</code> not the entire module, but some of its properties and methods? Lets say I somehow assigned my module to some local instance and if I investigate the internals of this instance, then I can see, that it contains only some particular properties and methods. Is it possible?</p>
