<p>I'm new to <code>RequireJs</code> library and so I have a question. In my application I have one localistation file (called <code>en.js</code>, <code>es.js</code>, etc) and exactly one settings file (<code>settings.js</code>). The first one is used to localize my application (change messages, titles etc.) and the second one is used to set some configuration on the app. So, what I want is to load both localisation file (say, <code>en.js</code>) and <code>settings.js</code> file, before the main application file is loaded. Here the file tree structure:</p>  <pre><code>\static     \js         \locale            en.js         \config            settings.js         \app            app.js </code></pre>  <p>In tutorials I've seen only one entry point specified by <code>data-main</code>, like:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;script data-main="scripts/main" src="scripts/require.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; </code></pre>  <p>But in my case it seems like there two main files (<code>en.js</code> and <code>settings.js</code>), that should be loaded first. So, what is the right way to implement this?</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>  <p>For those who are new to modular JavaScript, I advise to read <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/understanding-requirejs-for-effective-javascript-module-loading/" rel="nofollow">this</a> article. I had spent many hours, trying to understand documentation and dozens tutorials, before I found this article. And I think, it is the best source of information for modular JavaScript newbies.</p>
