<p>Trying to use the <a href="https://github.com/medialize/URI.js" rel="nofollow">URI.js</a> library in a project, but having trouble with RequireJS. URI's readme indicates that it works with requirejs - which is true when you're using the source - but not when using the <a href="https://github.com/medialize/URI.js/blob/gh-pages/src/URI.min.js" rel="nofollow">minified/concatenated distribution file</a> on its own - as you would in production.</p>  <p>Their build process scoops several libraries into a single <code>.min</code> file, and they all define themselves as modules.</p>  <p>No matter how I require that script, the only argument I receive is the first module in their distribution file (<code>IPv6</code>) which is not what I need.</p>  <p>Is there something trivial I'm missing? </p>    <pre><code>&lt;script&gt; require.config({     paths: {         urijs: 'dist/URI'     } });  require(['urijs'], function(URI) {     console.log(URI); }); &lt;/script&gt; </code></pre>
