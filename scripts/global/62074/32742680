<p>I'm having problems setting up TinyMCE with an existing setup of RequireJS. The bootstrap file (tinymce.dev.js, tinymce.js, tinymce.jquery.js, tinymce.jquery.dev.js) for TinyMCE 4.2.5 has its own <strong>define</strong> and <strong>require</strong> functions, which <strong>overwrite</strong> the ones supplied by RequireJS. I've tried commenting out the lines so that they don't overwrite the existing RequireJS functions, but this doesn't help. </p>
