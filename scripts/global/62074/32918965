<p>I want to include this library for use <a href="https://github.com/medialize/URI.js/tree/master" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/medialize/URI.js/tree/master</a></p>  <p>I have added it to <code>bower.json</code></p>  <pre><code>{   "name": "my-project",   "version": "1.0.0",   "dependencies": {        "urijs": "~1.16.1"  }  ... } </code></pre>  <p>When I load my project in a browser, I got these error:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/f3DYs.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/f3DYs.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>These scripts are all part of the urijs project. You can find them here: <a href="https://github.com/medialize/URI.js/tree/master/src" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/medialize/URI.js/tree/master/src</a></p>  <p>I would like to be able to resolve by requirejs configuration alone with minimal change (i.e. hopefully do not need to specify each dependent script indiviudally). What is the easiest way to define the dependency?</p>  <p>Is it possible? If so, how?</p>  <p>At the end I can resolve it by creating the final artefact and hosted the outcome in a forked project. I am hoping for a more elegant and/or simpler solution.</p>
