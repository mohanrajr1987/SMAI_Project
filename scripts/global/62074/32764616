<p>Is it possible to inject services into a route/state resolve when using AngularAMD/RequireJS?</p>  <p>The pattern of using route/state resolves to prepare data for a controller before the controller loads is a nice practice. I find it's especially useful for fetching data from the server and storing that data in a service, and this is something I've done successfully when <em>not</em> using AngularAMD.</p>  <p>When I implement AngularAMD and try to inject a service into the resolve, I get an "Unknown Provider" error, referencing the service that I'm trying to inject.</p>  <p>Here is a basic example that results in an Unknown Provider error being thrown for the OtherService.</p>  <pre><code>$stateProvider   .state('home', angularAMD.route({     url: '/home',     templateUrl: 'home.html',     controllerUrl: 'HomeCtrl.js',     controller: 'HomeCtrl',     resolve: {       stuff: function(OtherService) {         return OtherService.getStuff();       }     }   })); </code></pre>  <p>Has anyone encountered this issue? Any solutions and/or explanations for why it doesn't work?</p>  <p>This question - <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22561150/angularjs-requirejs-dependency-in-resolve">angularjs + requirejs + dependency in resolve</a> - regards the same issue, but the lone answer wasn't particularly helpful.</p>
