<p>I have an existing application  where I have AMD modules defined using <strong>RequireJS</strong>. I use "text" and "i18n" plugins for requirejs extensively in my project.  I have been experimenting with ES6 modules lately and would like to use them while creating new modules in my application. However, I want to reuse the existing AMD modules and import them while defining my ES6 modules.</p>  <p>Is this even possible? I know Traceur and Babel can create AMD modules from ES6 modules, but that only works for new modules with no dependency on existing AMD modules, but I could not find an example of reusing the existing AMD modules.</p>  <p>Any help will be appreciated. This is a blocker for me right now to start using all ES6 goodies.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
