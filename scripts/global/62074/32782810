<p>I'm developing a JavaScript plugin for webshops which is module based and I'm using require.js as module loader to integrate it into the customer's HTML template.</p>  <p>The idea behind that is to let the customer put only one line of code into their template and everything is loaded automatically.</p>  <p>I get problems when the webshop has third party scripts which define themself anonymously as AMD module but are included by a separate <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag. In this case I get errors like:</p>  <pre><code>Uncaught Error: Mismatched anonymous define() module: [..] http://requirejs.org/docs/errors.html#mismatch </code></pre>  <p>There is no way to me to take influence on that. It is also not possible for me to influence where in the template my one-liner is put by our customers. </p>  <p>Is there a way to tell require.js to just focus on the modules I name in my code and to ignore any other referenced module-define JavaScripts?</p>
