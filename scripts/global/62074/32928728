<p>I was introduced to Node.js a couple of hours ago.  I need to run this <a href="https://github.com/mkay581/social-api" rel="nofollow">Social-API-JS</a>.  I migrated the files to my Brackets directory and I thought I was expected to see the  tags be populated with data when I run in the web browser the index.html file.</p>  <p>When I check the console log the following error appears:</p>  <pre><code>http://127.0.0.1:58542/bower_components/requirejs/require.js Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found) </code></pre>  <p>What is expected me to do?  I installed requirejs, bower,  in the Node command and thought it could solve it, but I've been stuck for several hours now.  Any explanation is greatly appreciated.</p>
