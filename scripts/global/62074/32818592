<p>I am using Require.js in my app for module loading purpose; The app is working fine for few amount of user load say suppose 50 or 60 etc;</p>  <p>but when the load increases, ~2 out of 100 fails to load configuration correctly and app stops responding and goes to deadlock for those ~2 browser tabs; at that moment of time we need to open the app on new tab to start it again! </p>  <p>It throws <code>Uncaught Error: Load timeout for modules: main</code> error.</p>  <p>Could any one guide me if this seems to be require.js configuration load issue? Is user load is any thing to do with require.js configuration anyhow ?</p>
