<p>In our application we load requirejs, which in return loads angularjs, and also other javascript modules. I am wondering if there any way to get hole of these LOADED modules (angularjs, javascript modules) in protractor test. Note, we want the instance that is loaded by the browser when running Protractor, we don't want to create instance by ourselves.</p>  <p>Any suggestion or example?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
