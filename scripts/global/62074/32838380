<p>I've started using <code>RequireJS</code> in my projects and I really like it. The only thing that I do not like is that now I have in my templates such a picture:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="..." /&gt; &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="..." /&gt; .... dozens of css stylesheets &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="..." /&gt; &lt;script type="text/javascript" data-main="app.js" src="require/require.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;  </code></pre>  <p>So, I have dozens of links pointing to css files and only one single <code>script</code> tag that loads all needed modules with all their dependencies at once. I do not like that. I wish I could <code>define</code> modules with <code>css</code>, or to do something like:</p>  <pre><code>define(['logger.css'], function(logger){     return {         ... some properties and methods     } }); </code></pre>  <p>In other words I want to have an opportunity to define js modules and specify their required stylesheets at once. I do not want to load css separately and in an ugly way. From a designer prospective, it looks as if we solved the issue of spagetti js code, but still have the same old spagetti of css files. So, I wonder if there is a way to "pack" modules with js and css files in one box?</p>  <p><a href="https://github.com/guybedford/require-css" rel="nofollow">This</a> library looks promissing, but I'm not sure how to use it. I do not get how require.js and this library should come together. I do not understand, why in a <a href="https://github.com/guybedford/require-css/blob/master/example/test.html" rel="nofollow">demo-example</a> only require.js is loaded - why require.js and not css.js? So, I need a teeny-weeny, but complete example that demostrates how to pack css and js together in one module. Thanks!</p>
