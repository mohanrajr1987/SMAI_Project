<p>I'm using a macbook pro with OS X 10.10.5 and vim 7.3.  I've got the following remap <code>inoremap &lt;c-u&gt; &lt;esc&gt;viwU&lt;esc&gt;ea</code>.  Obviously, I expect the word under the cursor to be capitalized after pressing Ctrl-u, but instead it pages up.  I can't seem to figure out why this isn't working.  I see a few posts on remapping ctrl to cmd but I'd prefer to stick with cntrl - I use the same settings when working on a Windows machine.</p>  <p>As a note, I'm using a logitech keyboard, but it doesn't work on the mac keyboard as well.  </p>
