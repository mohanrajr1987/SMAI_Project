<p>I have a file (pac file) that contains IP addresses for a certain corporation and want to obscure out every IP address within it. One idea I had was to add 1 to every digit in the file and mod the resulting number with 256, so that it still remains a valid IP.</p>  <p>For e.g 129 will become <code>2310 % 256 = 6</code></p>  <p>Is there a quick way to apply such a change using vim? It sounds ambitious, but I thought I'd still ask. Here is an example of one block from the file.</p>  <pre><code>if (      isInNet(ip, "111.222.123.234", "255.255.255.224")  ||      isInNet(ip, "166.19.10.14", "255.255.255.192") ||   )  {return "DIRECT";} </code></pre>
