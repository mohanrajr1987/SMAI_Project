<p>When I start vim, I want to automatically have a few buffers open. So far I have this</p>  <pre><code>au VimEnter * :split | :vsplit | :vsplit </code></pre>  <p>Now I want to do a <code>Ctrl-w</code> followed by a <code>j</code> and then call <code>:vsplit</code> 2 more times so that my editor window looks like a grid of 6 buffers.</p>  <p>How can I run a basic motion command automatically (e.g. moving down a window)?</p>
