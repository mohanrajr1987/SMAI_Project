<p>I have the following code in vim Script(File name: file):</p>  <pre><code>:execute "normal /\This\&lt;CR&gt;gg" :let i=1 :execute "normal nxxcwThat".@=i </code></pre>  <p>I am executing this code on the following file(File name: out):</p>  <pre><code>This is line 1 This is line 2 </code></pre>  <p>I am using the following run command:</p>  <pre><code>vim -s file out </code></pre>  <p>And the output is:</p>  <pre><code>This is line 1 That 1 is line 2 </code></pre>  <p>I do not understand why is space getting printed between <code>That</code> and <code>1</code>.<br> Also, I am slightly confused in how to use register variables when writing a vimscript. Could someone please explain? </p>
