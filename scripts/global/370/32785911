<p>I am just trying to set up vim such that I get the colors I prefer.</p>  <p>I created a <code>~.vimrc file</code> and set <code>syntax on</code></p>  <p>I then went <code>Terminal &gt; Preferences &gt; Profile &gt; Text</code> and have been changing the ANSI colors such that the file looks the way I want</p>  <p>Unfortunately I have come across the problem that conditionals (if, else, and so on) are not using any of the ANSI colors and I therefore cannot change my preferences this way.</p>  <p>I have been looking in the vim syntax located at <code>/usr/share/vim/vim73/syntax</code> to see how this is implemented. I see where these are grouped, but cannot seem to find where the colors are assigned and why I cannot overwrite just this in my preferences.</p>  <p><strong>where am I able to go to find this code, and what are some of the options for customizing this</strong></p>  <h3>NOTE</h3>  <ul> <li>I am on Mac Yosemite 10.10.5</li> </ul>
