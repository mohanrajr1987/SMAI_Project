<p>I'm working on a plugin to allow bracket completion (I know it's available, it's more of a learning exercise).  To properly implement it, I need to add to the backspace mapping.  However, as it's an important key, I'd rather keep the existing functionality and just add to it rather than reimplementing the functionality.  The steps would basically be when in insert mode and press backspace, execute the original backspace key, then check for some conditions and maybe remove more characters.</p>  <p>I've tried something like <code>imap &lt;backspace&gt; &lt;backspace&gt;&lt;call_func_here&gt;</code>, but that doesn't seem to work.  Again, I know I could remap backspace to just the function and try to recreate the backspace functionality, but I'd prefer to not do that.</p>  <p>Is this possible in vim?</p>
