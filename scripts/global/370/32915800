<p>In vim, I have autosave to file with:</p>  <pre><code>augroup write_it     autocmd!     autocmd InsertLeave * write     autocmd TextChanged * write augroup END </code></pre>  <p>It works really good. But I need to place a wait in there for when I rapidly delete characters in command mode <code>TextChanged</code>. Any ideas how? It is a nightmare with livereload and gulp tasks watchers for front end development. </p>  <p>I tried <code>exec 'sleep 2'</code> but vim is async and it's useless. </p>
