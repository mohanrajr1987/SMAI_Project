<p>I am trying out the c.vim plugin. The plug-in works great. But I have a small problem in using Doxygen. What I would like is to generate a doxygen style comments for a function automatically ( as soon as I fill the place holders ).</p>  <p>But the latter is not working. It just generates the default comments.</p>  <p>I have set " let  g:C_UseTool_doxygen = 'yes' " in my .vimrc.</p>  <p>According to the documentation (<a href="http://lug.fh-swf.de/vim/vim-c/csupport.html#csupport-doxygen" rel="nofollow">http://lug.fh-swf.de/vim/vim-c/csupport.html#csupport-doxygen</a>), I should open the Templates file (<a href="https://github.com/vim-scripts/c.vim/blob/master/c-support/templates/Templates" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/vim-scripts/c.vim/blob/master/c-support/templates/Templates</a>) and include 'doxygen.template'. However, I dont have that template file. So I took it from <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/download_script.php?src_id=21803" rel="nofollow">http://www.vim.org/scripts/download_script.php?src_id=21803</a> and placed it in the right folder. Even now it is not working.</p>  <p>As a side question (or a comment)... I checked the idioms file for the template of function. There the return type is hard coded as "void". Should'nt the return type be a place holder?</p>  <p>Can someone help me.. especially with the first question...</p>
