<p>I have finally got the vim with airline plugin to wok on windows with conemu thanks to this topic: <a href="https://github.com/bling/vim-airline/issues/513" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/bling/vim-airline/issues/513</a></p>  <p>Almost everythink is good right now except some problems with colors in the airline when screen is scrolled. Check below gif: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/R8V6V.gif" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/R8V6V.gif" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I'm looking forward to find the culprit. At the beginning result was worse, but I commented everything that was reduntant. In spare time I will check each and every single setting the the vimrc file. But still can't get the airline to hold his colors.</p>  <p>My vimrc: <a href="https://gist.github.com/lkurylo/aa947a1ae6d7185aa064" rel="nofollow">https://gist.github.com/lkurylo/aa947a1ae6d7185aa064</a></p>
