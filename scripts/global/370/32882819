<p>There are some occasions that I wanted to open several files to be references and didn't want them to mess up my current buffer list. I have tried <code>:new</code>, <code>sp</code>, <code>vs</code>, and <code>:tabnew</code>, however, the new opened files are always kept in my current buffer list. Are there a way to create a brand new buffer list in order to keep these opened files separately? So, I could close these files entirely, whenever I didn't need to see them anymore, by using <code>1,100bd</code>. I have been googling it but still no luck.</p>
