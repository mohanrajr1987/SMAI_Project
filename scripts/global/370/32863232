<p>I am manually processing a very large number of files and so I use <code>vim *.txt</code> to open a batch of files and then <code>:bw</code> to close a file and move to the next one in the buffer. This works, but I would like to have a way to repeat <code>:bw</code> with one keystroke, the same way that you can use <code>.</code> to repeat the last command. (If I use <code>.</code>, it repeats the command that I had done before <code>:bw</code>, which was <code>dd</code>.)</p>
