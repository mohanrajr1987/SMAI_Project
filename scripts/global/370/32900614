<p>I've downloaded and include via pathogen the following cvs plugin:<a href="https://github.com/chrisbra/csv.vim" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/chrisbra/csv.vim</a>.  When using the :ArrangeCol function to align the columns, Vim throws the error E767: Too many arguments to printf().  I believe I've tracked it down to line 822: <code>return printf("%*S", width+1, a:field)</code>.  It looks like this just returns each column with space for its header + 1.  Has anyone seen this error or know what's going on?  I've seen it on both windows and mac. </p>  <p>I'm fairly certain that that is a valid printf expression, so I'm at a loss for what could be causing this.  </p>
