<p>In tmux, if I create a new window with <code>tmux new-window vim</code>, then in <code>vim</code> I launch a process (e.g. <code>:!scite &amp;</code>), then I exit <code>vim</code> (e.g. with <code>:q</code>), which will also close the tmux window, the launched process (<code>scite</code>) is also killed. How can I prevent this?</p>  <p>Note that the process is not killed if I use <code>tmux new-window</code> to create a new shell window first, then manually launch <code>vim</code>, then do the rest, and exit the shell.</p>
