<p>I have a fresh install of janus vim plugins and macvim.</p>  <p>For some reason when I open a .json file in macvim, there are no double quotes around the keys or values in the .json file.  As I scroll down the lines of the file, then double quotes show for the key and value of the line I am currently on.</p>  <p>If I open the file in vim, then everything works as expected.</p>  <p>Why is macvim behaving differently from vim?  How can I disable this macvim functionality?</p>  <p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
