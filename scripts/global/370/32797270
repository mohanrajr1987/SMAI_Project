<p>I have recently added the excellent <a href="https://github.com/fholgado/minibufexpl.vim/" rel="nofollow">fholgado/minibufexpl.vim</a> plugin to got a readily available display of all the existing buffers.</p>  <p>My problem now, though, is that I heavily rely on <code>CTRL+W W/H/J/K/L</code> to switch between splits and I keep missing that I'm in the plugin's split.</p>  <p>Is it possible to write some Vim code which would skip or disable navigation to a certain split?</p>
