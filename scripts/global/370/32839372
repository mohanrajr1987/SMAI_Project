<p>I have a colorscheme file called "aubergine.vim" I created which works well in most of my installations but for some reason the background colour is too light when using Cygwin, though the other colors seem fine.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/kvEUG.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i.stack.imgur.com/kvEUG.jpg</a></p>  <p>It seems the line that is causing the problem reads:</p>  <pre><code>hi Normal guifg=#cfbfad guibg=#140014 guisp=#140014 gui=NONE ctermfg=187 ctermbg=53 cterm=NONE </code></pre>  <p>The background colour should be "250025" but it is something more like "770077". Commenting the line out all together sets the background to be black, which is preferable to the lighter purple colour but I would prefer the "250025" value if it can be done.</p>  <p>Anyone know what the problem is here?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
