<p>I would like to check if any specified timezone (other than my local time zone) is in DST or not. </p>  <p>To check if the local time zone is currently DST I am using:</p>  <pre><code>Dim today_date As Date = Now.Date Msgbox(today_date.IsDaylightSavingTime()) </code></pre>  <p>I would like to check if other time zones ("A.U.S. Eastern Standard Time" and "New Zealand Standard Time") are in DST according to today's date.</p>  <p>So what I have so far:</p>  <pre><code>Dim AusZoneId As String = "A.U.S. Eastern Standard Time"  Dim AusZone As TimeZoneInfo = TimeZoneInfo.FindSystemTimeZoneById(AusZoneId) MsgBox(AusZone.SupportsDaylightSavingTime)  'Established True or False if TZ supported DST </code></pre>  <p>What I want to do is feed in a date (eg today) and see if this date according to AUS Eastern Standard time is in DST.</p>
