<p>I have recurring events created with a start_date through <strong>Ice Cube Gem</strong></p>  <p>If start_date is</p>  <pre><code>19 Oct 2015 18:00:00 UTC +00:00 </code></pre>  <p>And the recurrence is weekly, that means this events starts at 2PM every monday, until the Daily Saving Time is active, which means the event will start at 1 PM.</p>  <p>Is there a way to prevent that offset due to the DST?</p>
