<p>I'm using <code>timeSeries</code> package for manipulating and plotting time series.  I can create <code>timeSeries</code> object using GMT times, then, by setting <code>finCenter</code> property to "NewYork" I make it print times in New York local time zone.  <code>plot()</code> function also takes <code>FinCenter</code> argument, and one would think that by setting it you would get local times plotted on x axis. But it doesn't work for me, it still displays in GMT, no matter what I do.</p>  <pre><code>a &lt;- Sys.timeDate() + 1:5 a # NewYork # [1] [2015-09-29 21:54:50] [2015-09-29 21:54:51] [2015-09-29 21:54:52] # [4] [2015-09-29 21:54:53] [2015-09-29 21:54:54] at &lt;- timeSeries(1:5, a) at # NewYork #                     TS.1 # 2015-09-29 21:54:50    1 # 2015-09-29 21:54:51    2 # 2015-09-29 21:54:52    3 # 2015-09-29 21:54:53    4 # 2015-09-29 21:54:54    5 plot(at) plot(at, FinCenter = "NewYork") </code></pre>  <p>Both <code>plot</code> functions render the same x axis labels, in GMT. Anybody knows how to fix it?</p>
