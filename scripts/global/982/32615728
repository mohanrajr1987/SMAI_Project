<p>I'm collecting some system metrics from vagrant Ubuntu (14.04) box using Collectd and sending it to InfluxDB on my host machine (Ubuntu 14.04). As I query the data in InfluxDB, it returns data with UTC time while I'm using local time CEST on both vm and host causing -2 hours offset. I'm not precisely sure this is a Collectd issue or something wrong on my vagrant vm. I'm just a newbie. Any idea!?</p>  <p>Thanks,</p>
