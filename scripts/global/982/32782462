<p>I receive time in the format <code>12:00</code> and I also have a timezone in the format <code>&lt;DstTzInfo 'Europe/Paris' PMT+0:09:00 STD&gt;</code>. I want to see, if this date is already passed current time in that timezone. </p>  <p>My current timezone may be different from the timezone I receive, so I use the following: </p>  <pre><code>tz = pytz.timezone('Europe/Paris') d = parse("14:39").replace(tzinfo=tz) now = datetime.datetime.now(tz) print (d - now).total_seconds() </code></pre>  <p>Even though the current time in Paris is 14:39, I still get 6600 seconds. I also tried <code>now = datetime.datetime.replace(tzinfo=tz</code>), but I get -3600 seconds. </p>  <p>What I want is having time in a specified timezone, check whether it passed or not. </p>
