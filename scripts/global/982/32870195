<p>I am hosting a website on a shared server. They very helpfully (not) are refusing to set up the timezone tables. Not to be undone, I set up my own using the documentation (both ways) 1) via the SQL and 2 via the tables In both cases all the tables have data. In both cases  <code>select CONVERT_TZ ('2015-09-15 23:59:00', from_tz, to_tz)</code> returns null.</p>  <p>I have also tried to set it up on my Windows (again both ways)</p>  <p>Again, it returns null. If I use  <code>select CONVERT_TZ ('2015-09-15 23:59:00', '+2:00','-1:00')</code> it works.</p>  <p>Any ideas? Alternatively, can someone provide the code for <code>CONVERT_TZ</code>?</p>
