<p>I have a Java SE server application with a Saas website and registered users.</p>  <p>I have many events that occur on my server in different days.</p>  <p>Time is registered in localhost in a long number via <code>SYSTEM.currentTimeMillis()/1000</code></p>  <p>Registered users can check these events time from their respective country and they need to see the correct time based on their timezone (not server timezone) through the website.</p>  <p>How do I show them the historical time of the events <strong>in their timezone</strong>? Any idea about how you would deal with this situation? </p>
