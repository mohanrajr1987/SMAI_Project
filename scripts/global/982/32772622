<p>Event objects with start date are created from an IOS App to a Rails server.</p>  <p>Events are recurring : for example "happens every monday at 4PM" (Eastern time)</p>  <p>My dates are currently saved in UTC:</p>  <pre><code>4PM now with DST -&gt; 8 PM UTC 8PM UTC without DST (in a couple weeks) -&gt; 5PM </code></pre>  <p>So the users won't see the correct time.</p>  <p>Should I store the TimeZone and DST (false or true at the moment of the save) to take that offset into account?</p>
