<p>I want to know where my application is used. </p>  <p>Here is the code for getting the country name:</p>  <pre><code>public string Country = RegionInfo.CurrentRegion.DisplayName; </code></pre>  <p>Here is the code to get the timezone:</p>  <pre><code>public void TimeStamp() {     TimeZone zone = TimeZone.CurrentTimeZone;     // Demonstrate ToLocalTime and ToUniversalTime.     DateTime local = zone.ToLocalTime(DateTime.Now);      _TimeStamp = local.ToString(); } </code></pre>  <p>I want to see if this works for other locations and IP addresses. I have tried to change my IP address using cyperghost, but nothing changed. I live in Denmark and the code above still shows "Denmark xx.xx.xx xx.xx.xx". </p>  <p>How can I test if this code actually works as I want it to? </p>
