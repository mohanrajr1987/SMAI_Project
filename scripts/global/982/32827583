<p>I need to make sure that client has his/her timezone set manually in the application regardless of their actual timezone. I am changing both <code>back-end (php)</code> and <code>front-end (ExtJS)</code> of my app to support this requirement.</p>  <p>Basically php and sqlite will have everything in GMT, it used to have servers timezone before. <strong>Now the tricky part seems to be the javascript</strong>. Javascript date functions display everything with browsers timezone. But I need to get i.e. LA time in New York, or change it to Chicago whenever I want and be able to see all the dates in Chicago timezone.</p>  <p>This is what I am doing now <strong>without using external libraries</strong>.</p>  <ol> <li>I want to get and send all dates from/to back-end in GMT</li> <li>On client side user logs in with profile that has custom timezone assigned</li> <li>Based on this timezone I am trying to adjust all of my dates so that browser will display them accordingly. </li> </ol>  <p>This is my idea. Please give me feedback, what i need to change? Will it work or not? I would like to override javascript's <strong>new Date()</strong> but I am getting correct results by adjusting seconds:</p>  <pre><code>// JSON of all timezone names with GMT offset, created this from php lib classes  var tz_offsets = {"America/Los_Angeles": -25200, ...}; var user_cutom_timezine = "America/Los Angeles";  var d = new Date(); var gmtTimesFromDatabase = 1443456898;  // get offset d = d.getTimezoneOffset();  // then adjust timestamp to get seconds in GMT var gmt_seconds = gmtTimesFromDatabase + d*60;  // BUT THIS IS NOT ENOUGH, now that i have GMT, i need to apply user's custom  // timezone in his/her profile var user_date = new Date((gmt_seconds + tz_offsets[user_cutom_timezine])*1000); </code></pre>  <p>I guess my <strong>main concern</strong> is that I have a lot of files that use <code>new Date()</code> and to call my custom functions on every single one (remember that I also have to convert dates to GMT timestamps before sending to database) seems a bit overkill.</p>  <p>Can I somehow after login, override the <code>new Date()</code> once and then use it without calling my functions on it? </p>
