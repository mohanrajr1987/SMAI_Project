<p>I have multiple people uploading log files to my website and the info that is being ingested is time stamps that look like <code>Wed Sep 23 13:07:27 2015</code> (these can't be changed as they are output by a program I have no control over) I need to convert these into UTC/GMT unix timestamps, I have access to what timezone offset they have (like <code>-05:00</code> for Central Time) I need to store the timestamps as unix timestamps because they are being displayed on the website with the website having <code>date_default_timezone_set('America/New_York');</code> set.</p>  <p>This is the ingest code I currently have</p>  <pre><code>strtotime($log["tzoffset"] . ' hours',strtotime($log["orig_time"])) </code></pre>  <p><code>tzoffset</code> is the Timezone offset of the user uploading the file <code>-05:00</code></p>  <p><code>orig_time</code> is the timestamp from the file <code>Wed Sep 23 13:07:27 2015</code></p>  <p>This is the display code</p>  <pre><code>date_default_timezone_set('America/New_York');  date('m-d-Y h:i A', $times["log_time"]) </code></pre>
