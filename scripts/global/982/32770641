<p>I'm trying to parse the tzfile (Olson) format on a Unix system.  In the tzfile(5) man page it states the following:</p>  <pre><code>Then there are tzh_ttisstdcnt standard/wall indicators, each stored as a one-byte value; they tell whether the transition times associated with local time types were specified as standard time or wall clock time, and are used when a timezone file is used in handling POSIX-style timezone environment variables.  Finally, there are tzh_ttisgmtcnt UTC/local indicators, each stored as a one-byte value; they tell whether the transition times associated with local time types were specified as UTC or local time, and are used when a timezone file is used in handling POSIX-style timezone environment variables. </code></pre>  <p>Does this mean I can ignore isstd and isgmt and still get the correct times?  In spot checking, this seems to be the case but in digging around in the C source files, I see unix makes some adjustments dependant on these values.</p>
