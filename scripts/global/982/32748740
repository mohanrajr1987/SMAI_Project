<p>I want to change the timezone of my project to IST. So that all the datetime operations for Eg: created_at,deleted_at, timestamp fields in DB are saved in IST format. Which laravel 5 allows easily by changing project_root/config/app.php file. We just have to change <strong>'timezone' => 'UTC'</strong> to <strong>'timezone' => 'IST'</strong>.</p>  <p>Now if I do make this change in my local, application works perfectly with IST timezone. But when I am trying to set the same on AWS EC2 instance it stores the datetime in DB in UTC format only.</p>  <p>What could be the problem?</p>  <p>Is it even the right way what I am doing?</p>
