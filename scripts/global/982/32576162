<p>I'm facing an issue in google spreadsheet. I want to get  last updated time of spreadsheet in timezone whatever set in spreadsheet? I'm using <code>worksheet.getUpdated()</code> but it giving me wrong time. For this I need current timezone of google spreadsheet. So is there any way to get timezone values from spreadsheet? or any other way to get last updation time of spreadsheet in current spreadsheet's timezone? i.e. if spreadsheet timezone is set to IST then it should show last update time in IST standard even if it accessed from China or USA...</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
