<p>So, in my settings I have the following:</p>  <pre><code>LANGUAGE_CODE = 'en-us'  USE_I18N = True  USE_L10N = True  USE_TZ = True  TIME_ZONE = 'Europe/Copenhagen' </code></pre>  <p>However, when I issue:</p>  <pre><code>timezone.now() datetime.datetime(2015, 9, 26, 8, 47, 15, 862729, tzinfo=&lt;UTC&gt;) </code></pre>  <p>And the time is two hours late.</p>  <p>I was reading the documentation and I could see that this method calls datetime.datetime() and the information there is correct. I could see the output is based on variable TIME_ZONE, which is set to my current location. Shouldn't timezone.now() get the correct TIME_ZONE time then?</p>  <p>Another question: Does datetime.datetime() gets the information from the server?</p>
