<p>Is it possible to specify timezone for results in YQL?</p>  <p>Returned default one are UTC+1 and I don't know why. How to change this? Of course, I can assume that results are always UTC+1, but is it a rule (I can't find it in Doc)...</p>  <pre><code>select * from yahoo.finance.xchange where pair in ("EURUSD") </code></pre>  <p>query->results->rate-> date/time seems to be in UTC+1, while query ->created is in UTC+/-0</p>
