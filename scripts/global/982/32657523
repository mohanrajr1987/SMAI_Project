<p>i have an application that receives an event every hour(via quartz). So this could happen 24 times per day.</p>  <p>There are 3 exclusion times within that day that I do not want to take any action when I receive an event(must still receive the event via quartz, so solution is not to update quartz cron expressions)</p>  <p>I need to configure the times for these 3 times in the timezone of the customer. In this case it will be CEST where summer(UTC+2) and winter(UTC+1) time are observed. The times are 00:00, 08:00, 16:00 where I will have a buffer of 5 minutes either side of these times. </p>  <p>So taking the 08:00 as an example and I receive an event any time between 07:55 to 08:05 I will perform no action.</p>  <p>My application will be working in UTC time, however the exclusion times need to be configure in CEST and in the future other timezones.</p>  <p>Initial thinking is to take the current date and work out exclusion times in UTC for that date but I believe there would be issues with this approach</p>  <p>Any ideas?</p>
