<p>I've seen the posts about how to regenerate the R file but this is different. </p>  <p>I have an app on the appstore. This specific error refers to a color I have in the res/values/ folder. I tried to recreate this error that some of my users have had but with no luck. Some users have gotten error, others do not.</p>  <p>Under what conditions can cause this error to appear? Mostly, this seems to come from Samsung devices running Android 5.0.</p>
