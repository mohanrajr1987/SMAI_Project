<p>Is there a way to get an error code != 0 from Django shell when experiencing some issue e.g. an uncatched exception inside?</p>  <p>So imagine something like that: </p>  <pre><code>echo " from django.contrib.auth.models import User; User.objects.create_superuser('admin', 'root@localhost',  'secure_me')" | ./manage.py shell </code></pre>  <p>will cause an exception, if the user admin is already existing. Unfortunately it's even in such a case a return code of 0.</p>
