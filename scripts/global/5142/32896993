<p>Let's say I have:</p>  <pre><code>def fn1():     # do some work     # in some cases raise exception  def fn2():     # do some work     try:         fn1()     except:         # do some work </code></pre>  <p>I want to test the negative path by raising an exception from within pdb.  I tried from <code>fn1</code>:</p>  <pre><code>(Pdb) raise cliexceptions.NoConnectionError("Could not connect") *** NoConnectionError: 'Could not connect to SSR' </code></pre>  <p>It prints the msg but does not exit <code>fn1</code>. Is there a way to do that?</p>
