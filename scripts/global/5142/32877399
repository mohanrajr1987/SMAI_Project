<p>I've got a UIView designed in InterfaceBuilder that has a Swift backing class. I'm using <code>awakeAfterUsingCoder()</code> to substitute the instantiated nib like so:</p>  <pre><code>public override func awakeAfterUsingCoder(aDecoder: NSCoder) -&gt; AnyObject? {     if self.subviews.count == 1 &amp;&amp; self.subviews[0].isKindOfClass(UILabel) {         let bundle = NSBundle(forClass: self.dynamicType)         let nib = UINib(nibName: "CustomView", bundle: bundle).instantiateWithOwner(nil, options: nil)         return nib[0] as! CustomView     }      return self } </code></pre>  <p>However, now I keep getting <code>EXC_BAD_ACCESS</code> crashes in the AppDelegate. I turned on zombies and was able to get this message:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>*** -[ModuleName.CustomView _referenceView]: message sent to deallocated instance 0xed13600</p> </blockquote>  <p><code>_referenceView</code> must be defined somewhere in the framework, though I didn't see it when I navigated <code>self</code> stopped at a breakpoint. What am I doing wrong?</p>
