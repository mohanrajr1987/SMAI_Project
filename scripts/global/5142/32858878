<p>I have requirement send message if I get any exception in code with out using custom exception class in core java. if get any exception I need to execute a block of functionality from predefined exception override method class. Is there any thing which override Exception or Throwable class methods?</p>  <p>For eg:</p>  <pre><code>public class One {  public void method1() {    try {    // some code       } catch(Exception e) {       System.out.println(e.message);    }   }    } </code></pre>  <p>my requirement is: send error message when control came into catch block without writing message code in catch block.</p>  <p>In spring we can do this by help of point cut in @AfterThrowing annotation.</p>  <p>like this is there any way to send message when control came into catch block?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
