<p>I currently developped a project with VS and OpenCV on my x64 computer and i've a problem with this line:</p>  <pre><code>model-&gt;train(image, labels); </code></pre>  <p>image and labels are not empty but i've got this error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Unhandled exception at at 0x774FC42D in facerec_video.exe: Microsoft C++ exception: cv::Exception at memory location 0x0015EF38.</p> </blockquote>  <p>If i click "continue", program continue and works. Furthermore, if i set a breakpoint on this line and do a step by step, error message doesn't appear and program works too.</p>  <p>How to resolve this problem ? Thanks</p>
