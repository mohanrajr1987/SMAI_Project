<p>I'm using spring-data-jpa to read/write to my DB.  I've read through the documentation for spring-data and the one thing that I can't seem to locate is how it handles exceptions.</p>  <p>I am looking to catch any type of exception thrown by a repo action.  Is there a way of doing this short of just wrapping the individual repo action in a try/catch and catching any RuntimeException?  I'd rather avoid that as that is an even larger catch-all than I'd like.</p>  <p>Does spring-data wrap all exceptions in its own SpringDataException() or something similar?  I've looked through the spring-data-commons jar as well as the spring-data-jpa jar and didn't find anything applicable.</p>
