<p>I'm talking something like this website - <a href="http://www.flipkart.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.flipkart.com</a></p>  <p>I can make it stay relevant to the layout, but the layout in the above given website simply stays in place, as if we're zooming on an image. HOW could that be replicated?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
