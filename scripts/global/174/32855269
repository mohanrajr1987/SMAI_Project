<p>I have searched and searched on google, but all I could find is either websites that provide some fancy images, or other sites that allow you to upload an image and resize it, or Google search results where you can filter images with size (which doesn't work all of the time). </p>  <p>I need to have some fancy images (not so fancy) for prototyping purposes for my projects with difference sizes, for example a dummy logo with specific size, or pictures of laptops (to view products) with specific sizes. </p>  <p>Is there any website out there that provides this service? </p>
