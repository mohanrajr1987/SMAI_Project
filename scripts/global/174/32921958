<p>I'm a newbie in OO design and there is one of SOLID principles is LISKOV Substitution Principle.</p>  <p>But in my design I've a classes named StartCommunicationMessage, ContinueCommunicationMessage, EndCommunicationMessage, AbortCommunicationMessage.</p>  <p><strong>StartCommunicationMessage</strong> contains: <em>commID</em>, <em>qualityOfCommunication</em>, DestAddr, origAddr <strong>EndCommunicationMessage</strong> contains: <em>commID</em>, <em>qualityOfCommunication</em>, <em>DestAddr</em> <strong>ContinueCommunicationMessage</strong> contains: <em>commID</em>, <em>qualityOfCommunication</em>, <em>DestAddr</em>, <em>origAddr</em> <strong>AbortCommunicationMessage</strong> contains: <em>commID</em>, <em>DestAddr</em></p>  <p>So I can make make a parent for all of these message called <strong>CommunicationMessage</strong> that contains: <em>commID</em>, <em>DestAddr</em></p>  <p>But <em>qualityOfCommunication</em> is not found in Abort, so it will be repeated as well as it getter and setter in all other classes which make a duplication.</p>  <p>Is there a way to reduce this duplication either by violating the above rule or anything else?</p>
