<p>In my work place the project managers want to introduce Business Process Management in all of our projects. All the specification and implementation of all projects will be based in Business Process modelling. I think that all projects will turn, in some way, in Business Process Management Software. This is a good idea for a software company? I think the idea is to all the development teams to wok in the same way. But developing a process-centric application is a good solution for all the problems?</p>
