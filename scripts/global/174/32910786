<p>I am creating an application on Visual Studios and require a bit of help. There will be quite a few pages on this application and I do not want new forms for each page.</p>  <p>I would like all these pages to appear on the same window. I have buttons at the top of the window which will be the toolbar for all the pages and will not change. I want the content below them to change. I would also like to have a vertical scrollbar to appear if the content exceeds the height of the window.</p>  <p>I have tried to look for tutorials but I don't think I have the right keywords.</p>
