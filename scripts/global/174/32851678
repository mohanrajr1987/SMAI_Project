<p>I want to implement team hierarchy on a web page. At a time one level should be displayed. When I select one person at that level,  people who direct reports to him/her should be displayed at next level and so on.</p>  <p>I would not be knowing the height of the tree in advance. What are the different ways by which I can implement this in HTML/CSS/JS? How should I render that on web page? </p>  <p>All the suggestions are valuable. If you know any such links that have implemented this structure please paste those.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
