<p>I was unsure what to name this question. If you have a better name, please enlighten me. </p>  <p>I am making an app in which the main screen is a sliding layer. If swiped in one direction, it will reveal a page "underneath" it, and if swiped in the other direction, it will reveal a different page "underneath" it. I understand this is an unorthodox use of a sliding layer, and the wunderlist sliding layer lib, which I wanted to use, no longer supports such functionality. </p>  <p>Any ideas for how I can pull this off?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
