<p>I am slightly confused when it comes to creating images for the IPhone 6 and 6 plus. The problem is I have a button created using IB set at say 70x70. I want the button to expand so that it increases for the larger IPhones </p>  <p>Now if I test this out by switching between size options in IB I notice the size changes as expected so:</p>  <p>4 Inch = 70x70 4.7 Inch = 83x85 5.5 Inch = 91x96</p>  <p>I was wondering in terms of creating the assets i.e @2x and @3x do I do it based upon the 70x70 or do I go by the largest size so 91x96? I know the aspect ratio stays the same so I am a little unsure as to what to pick.</p>
