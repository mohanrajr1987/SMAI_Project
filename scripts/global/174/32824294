<p>I´m creating a Mysql database where the user table is implemented for login/access purposes and i need to create an employee table with current and past employees. The current employees should have a (1 to 1)corresponding user, past employees shouldn´t. What would be the best way of doing this? Is the design correct?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
