<p>In one of my Netflix Zuul Error Filters (on certain conditions) i want to return a response with Custom String. But, by the time the control comes to my Error Filter, the response.isCommitted() is showing as TRUE. </p>  <p>There was a call to <code>dispatcher.forward()</code> which failed just before the control came to my Zuul Error Filters. I guess this forward() call has committed the response. <strong><em>Does this mean the response has already gone to the client ?</em></strong></p>  <p>i tried using the following but my custom String is not going as the response to client.</p>  <pre><code>RequestContext currentContext = RequestContext.getCurrentContext(); currentContext.setResponseBody(myCustomString); </code></pre>  <p>now i want to try the following to inject my custom response instead of the previously committed response.</p>  <pre><code>RequestContext currentContext = RequestContext.getCurrentContext(); currentContext.setResponse(new MyCustomResponseWrapper(myCustomString)); </code></pre>  <p><strong><em>How can i construct MyCustomResponseWrapper extending the HttpServletResponseWrapper ?</em></strong> I want the response to be created using the custom string which is given as input.</p>
