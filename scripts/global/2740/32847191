<p>I'm new to JavaEE and I have a problem with java servlet.</p>  <p>I have a servlet works well. Then I want to add another one. However, once I added the second one, the first one no longer works and server always respond 404 without any content (Normally the 404 will return with a page, not it is just a white page)</p>  <p>There must be some problems with the second servlet and If I disable one line of code the first servlet works. However I haven't seen any error messages</p>  <p>Can someone tell me the reason of this and how can I debug the program. (I cannot debug the program because the request cannot map to the second servlet and no breakpoints work)</p>  <p>Thanks a lot.</p>  <p>Fallflame</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>  <p>Now it works, thanks to Danail Alexiev remind me that it is may be a configuration problem. I found an error that said "cannot convert the project to dynamic web 2.5" and I just do maven -> update project then it works.</p>  <p>Still cannot understand why.</p>  <p>This is the one line code that let all servlets don't works : </p>  <pre><code>ServiceMetadata edm = odata.createServiceMetadata(new DemoEdmProvider(), new ArrayList&lt;EdmxReference&gt;()); </code></pre>  <p>all copied from Apache Olingo tutorial.</p>
