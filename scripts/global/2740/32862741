<p>I am having the following requirement ..  A servlet is there who scans database with huge dataset and fetch all metadata information, if the database is big it takes 2+ minutes to scan , Instead of only showing loading i want to show the actual progress in % in client machine by sending a calculated value as response periodically .. But the main roadblock to this is only single response is possible from servlet to client , How  i can achieve this ??    </p>
