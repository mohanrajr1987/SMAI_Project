<p>So rather simple question, with quite few answers online, but I've tried them all and none of them seem to work for me.</p>  <pre><code>        ServletContext servletContext = getServletContext();         RequestDispatcher rd = servletContext.getRequestDispatcher("Home");         rd.forward(request, response); </code></pre>  <p>This is my current attempt , which produces <code>java.lang.NullPointerException</code></p>  <p>I've also tried using  <code>RequestDispatcher rd = request.getRequestDispatcher("Home");</code>  Which produces a blank page </p>  <pre><code>response.sendRedirect("Home"); </code></pre>  <p>Works but doesn't preserve same session</p>  <p>I am redirecting from my Login servlet to Home servlet, both are stored in same package, both are in web.xml ( even if that is no longer needed)</p>
