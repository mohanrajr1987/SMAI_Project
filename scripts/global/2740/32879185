<p>I'm using Guice in a project for dependency injection into Servlets. We have a ServletModule that defines the serve().with() configuration. This all works fine.</p>  <p>I now need to be able to include a webapp with servlets defined in the web.xml. All of the documentation says add GuiceFilter to web.xml and then use the programattic config in the ServletModule, but I'm wondering if it's possible to get Guice to inject dependencies into servlets configured in web.xml?</p>  <p>I want to be able to define servlets in web.xml eg:</p>  <pre><code> &lt;servlet&gt;    &lt;servlet-name&gt;test&lt;/servlet-name&gt;    &lt;servlet-class&gt;TestServlet&lt;/servlet-class&gt;  &lt;servlet&gt; </code></pre>  <p>When the servlet is created the container just called the no-arg constructor. Can this behaviour be changed so that Guice creates the servlet and injects at creation time?</p>
