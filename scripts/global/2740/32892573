<p>So we have a web app that calls a Java Servlet that generates an image of a signature that a user previously drew on a canvas.  The first time the page loads the image (from an img tag), the image loads as whatever they drew.  I placed a breakpoint in the servlet, and I watched the network traffic in the browser developer tools to verify it was working.  But then if they redraw the signature (which we have verified was stored on the back end), the servlet break point doesn't get hit again and the network traffic doesn't show it requesting the image again.</p>  <p>So all I can assume is that IE11 is caching the image and not requesting the image again from the servlet.  The rest of the page is completely reloading and Javascript isn't involved in loading this image.  And this works on all other browsers and earlier versions of IE.</p>  <p>Any ideas?  I tried googling this, but I don't have any idea what to search for.</p>
