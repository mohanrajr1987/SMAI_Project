<p>I have a Java class (Servlet). I need to display the source code; whatever the content in the servlet. <strong>This is totally for testing purpose</strong></p>  <p>I know that I could do this through appending to a StringBuffer object, but I have more lines. And another alternative it write to a file. It's again the same. I should write every single line using a file writer. Is there a simple approach to this?</p>  <p>How can I achieve this?</p>  <pre><code>public class TimeZoneValidator extends HttpServlet { private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;  public TimeZoneValidator() {     super(); }  protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {      //I need this code to be displayed in my JSP(index.jsp) file      request.setAttribute("oldNumberOfNghtsCalc", oldNumberOfNghtsCalc);     request.setAttribute("newNumberOfNghtsCalc", newNumberOfNghtsCalc);     RequestDispatcher requestDispatcher = request.getRequestDispatcher("/index.jsp");     requestDispatcher.forward(request, response); }  } </code></pre>
