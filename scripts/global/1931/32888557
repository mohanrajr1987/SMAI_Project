<p>I have created a mock service that would act just like my real service but return a defined set of values for my unit test. If I add that module to my apps. it intercepts the calls and returns the things I have in the mock just like its suppose to.</p>  <p>but when I add this module to my jasmine test I cant seem to get a value back </p>  <pre><code>beforeEach(module('VideoConference'));//my app beforeEach(module('lookupServiceMock')); //the mock service beforeEach(inject(function(Mlb) { // Mlb is a factory that submits requests     mlb = Mlb;     spyOn(mlb, 'submitRequest').and.callThrough(); })); ... it("Should Create a new conference", function () {     childScope = $scope.$new();     vm = $controller('TitleAndDateCtrl', { $scope: childScope });                   childScope.requiredFieldsMet = function () { return true }     vm.conference.Title = "Test";                   vm.createConference();     expect(mlb.submitRequest).toHaveBeenCalled();//this expectation comes back true }); it("Should have returned a value", function() {     var id = mlb.get("id");//at this point expect that the id has been set     expect(id).toBe(123); }); </code></pre>  <p>When I step through, the controller does go to where the $http.post(...) is made but it does not hit my mock or return a value. it does not go into the success of the post. any idea how to make it hit my mock, return the value</p>
