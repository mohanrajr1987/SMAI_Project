<p>I'm working for two teams A and B. Therefore I need to create and install two development certificates. When I set "code signing identity" in Xcode's "build settings" to the general value "iOS Developer" my both team's <strong>applications</strong> are building and running without errors. But if I setup the same for my App's <strong>unit tests</strong> Xcode is not able to decide which of the two code signing identities it shall use and the following error is shown:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>iPhone Developer: ambiguous. (matches "iPhone Developer: Max M. (Team A ID) and "iPhone Developer: Max M. (Team B ID))</p> </blockquote>
