<p>Has anyone used mockejb to test MDB (Message driven Bean)</p>  <p>I found this rough example online to mock the queue and bean deployed on the container but I don't think there is anyway I would understand this. </p>  <p>This is the link to the example</p>  <p><a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/entarch/mock-ejbs3-091837.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/entarch/mock-ejbs3-091837.html</a> <a href="http://mockejb.sourceforge.net/java2html/org/mockejb/test/MDBTest.java.html" rel="nofollow">http://mockejb.sourceforge.net/java2html/org/mockejb/test/MDBTest.java.html</a></p>  <p>(I think its better if I just post the link rather than the whole content)</p>  <p>Set up on my local 1. I have a MDB called updateCustomerMDB 2. It calls the service tier i.e. a bean called updateInformationServiceBean Now I don't understand how I can fill in these values in the above example to test my MDB</p>  <p>Basically I don't understand where I am supposed to substitute my classes. </p>  <p>Thanks in advance. </p>
