<p>I was trying to test userController to get users async by its service, doing the test method void. The thing is that everything compiles but then the test dont run.</p>  <pre><code>[TestClass] public class UserControllerTests {    [TestMethod]    public async void UserController_GetAll_Returns_Not_Null()    {     var result = await controller.GetALL();      Assert.IsNotNull(result);    } } </code></pre>
