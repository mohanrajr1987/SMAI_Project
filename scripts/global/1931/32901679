<p>I have a CMake project separated in three parts:</p>  <ol> <li>Compilation of my libraries</li> <li>Compilation of many unit tests programs testing each precise subpart of those libraries</li> <li>Compilation of program samples using those libraries</li> </ol>  <p>My question is about the 2<sup>nd</sup> part. My unit tests executables are short binary programs with a <code>main</code> returning 0 on success, 1 on fail. I would like to integrate their running as part of the build.</p>  <p>Is it possible to use CMake to do one of those two solutions:</p>  <ul> <li>Run every unit test program and check return values and generate an error if any fail.</li> <li>Generate a test script that would run and check every unit test program and check return values to yield an error if any fail.</li> </ul>  <p>I'm not looking for a complete CMake script code, a simple indication on what is possible with a link to corresponding documentation would be enough.</p>
