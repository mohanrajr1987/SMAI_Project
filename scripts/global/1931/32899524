<p>My application is deeply integrated with parse.com and has a lot of unit tests written and much more to go.</p>  <p>And, surprise, I need to generate some test data for each test. The problem is that running all specs could take a lot of time, because app has to communicate with remote parse.com servers.</p>  <p>Is there any library which would store data on local machine instead of sending it to parse? This would make unit testing much more easier.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
