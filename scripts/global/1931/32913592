<p>I am trying to use <code>WithArg</code> in some test code. The code that I am trying to compile looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>using ::testing::_; using ::testing::Invoke; using ::testing::WithArg;  EXPECT_CALL(myMock, MockMethodThatTakesAString(_))                    .WithArg&lt;0&gt;(Invoke(this, &amp;TestClass::FunctionThatTakesAString))                    .Times(4); </code></pre>  <p>When I try to compile this, I get the error</p>  <p><code>error: ‘class testing::internal::TypedExpectation&lt;void(const std::basic_string&lt;char&gt;&amp;)&gt;’ has no member named ‘WithArg’</code></p>  <p>What am I doing wrong here?</p>
