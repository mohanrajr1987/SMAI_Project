<p>I'm looking for a way to grab all <code>process.stdout</code> and pipe to a log file, I have the following:</p>  <pre><code>import fs from 'fs'; let logFile = fs.createWriteStream('./test.log', {   encoding: 'utf8',   flags   : 'a' }); process.stdout.pipe(logFile); </code></pre>  <p>However, it seems to still spit all <code>stdout</code> to the console and I'm not getting anything in the log file (although it's being created).</p>
