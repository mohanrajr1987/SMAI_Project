<p>I have this set of .gz files and inside each of them is a single text file. This text file needs to be used in a C program. The following code solves this problem somehow where parameters 1 and 2 are integers which I'm receiving as arguments for the C program (argc, argv[]) in <code>main()</code>.     </p>  <p>gzip -dc xyz.txt.gz | ./program parameter1 parameter2</p>  <p>Can someone explain how the above code works in command line? How does the text file automatically get passed to the program? Do I need to write extra code in the C program to receive this text file?</p>
