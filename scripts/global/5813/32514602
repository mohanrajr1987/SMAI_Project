<p>I have a simple C++ program that uses <code>cin</code> to read eight numbers, and I'm running it in a bash shell. When I run it in the terminal, it looks like this (the user types in the numbers 1-8):</p>  <pre><code>./add8 Please enter eight numbers: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 The sum is: 36  </code></pre>  <p>I am trying to pipe in a file that has the eight numbers (e.g., "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8" and a newline), but the input does not show on the screen:</p>  <pre><code>./add8 &lt; my_eight_numbers.txt Please enter eight numbers: The sum is: 36 </code></pre>  <p>Is it possible to pipe the file into the program <em>and</em> show the input as if the user typed it?</p>
