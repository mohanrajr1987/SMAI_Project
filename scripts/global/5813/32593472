<p>I'm trying to run a command that grabs my current IP address (or addresses) and saves this to a variable so that I can then see on screen. I want to do this so that I can run this in a script and use the variable in a loop.     </p>  <pre><code>userip='ifconfig | grep "inet addr:" | cut -d: -f2  |  awk '{print $1}''  echo $userip </code></pre>  <p>Everytime I run this command, its basically getting the speech marks mixed up and thus not running whole command.</p>  <p>It's really just got <code>'ifconfig | grep "inet addr:" | cut -d: -f2  |  awk '</code> in the single quotations.</p>  <p>Any advice would be extremely helpful thanks.</p>
