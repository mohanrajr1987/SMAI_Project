<p>I am new to libuv with Linux system programming experiences. I am looking for a way to use Linux pipe under libuv. I studied uv_pipe_* related API a bit but unfortunately, still feels in the dark. </p>  <p>When programming with Linux pipe system call, things are very straightforward and easy. pipe() returns an array of two file descriptors: sd[0] and sd[1] . So one thread can read sd[1] and another thread can write to sd[0]. </p>  <p>But with libuv, how could I achieve the same goal of inter thread communication via linux pipe ? </p>  <p>Thanks in advance, Frank </p>
