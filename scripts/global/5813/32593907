<p>I am writting a mini-shell for linux system. I consider a implementation pipe (I mean for example: ls | less ) and redirection of input ( I mean for example  ls > file.txt ) And I would like to know/learn how to implement it. To be more precisely I need to understand how it works.</p>  <p>So I am asking for reference me to ( short, I beg! :D ) any tutorial or give me your brief.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance. </p>
