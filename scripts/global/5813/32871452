<p>I have a C++ app running on 64 bit Linux. I am planning to pass a simple struct data (without virtual function in it) from one thread to another thread ( in same process) via pipe WITHOUT any special consideration of alignment. Basically, the sending side sends the amount of sizeof(struct) bytes. And recving side cast those bytes to struct.  There is no concurrent access/atomicity concern. And there won't be any plan to pass the data to a different process or remote machine in the future.  </p>  <p>I am positive that the code will work as expected. </p>  <p>However, I like to get opinions from experts of SO on my approach to see if there is any potential issues. ( as testing might not disclose them in this case).</p>
