<p>I'm new to bash, so go easy on me. I am trying to pipe results from enscript to a file and then displaying that file in the terminal. Here is what I have so far: <br> <code>enscript -2p output CSCI330/lectures/{1/{1-a,1-b,1-c},2/2-a} | cat output</code> It seems to work but when it prints to the terminal I get all the postscript code printed out with it also. I have also tried the <b>-z</b> option with enscript but that didn't help either. Any input to help me solve this problem is greatly appreciated. Thanks!</p>
