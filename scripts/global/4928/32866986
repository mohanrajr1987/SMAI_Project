<p>I'm trying to write a stored procedure that will return a number (an average) - this is what I have so far...</p>  <pre><code>ALTER PROCEDURE [dbo].[sp_GetAverageRating]     @RecipeNodeId int  AS      SET NOCOUNT ON;      (SELECT SUM(Rating) AS RatingTotal      FROM dbo.RecipeRating      WHERE RecipeNodeId = @RecipeNodeId)      (SELECT           COUNT(Rating) AS RatingEntries       FROM dbo.RecipeRating       WHERE RecipeNodeId = @RecipeNodeId) </code></pre>  <p>So this works and gives me </p>  <p>A.) Rating Total<br> B.) Number of Rating Entries</p>  <p>I want to return Rating Total / Rating Entries from the stored procedure.</p>  <p>Can anyone help me with the syntax please?</p>
