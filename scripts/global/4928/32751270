<p>very new to Prolog and I'm absolutely awful at it.</p>  <p>I am trying to get a sum for all the marks received on assignments, and return it. The sum predicate must be of the form <code>sumAssignments(S)</code>.</p>  <p>Here's the knowledge base I've made:</p>  <pre><code>assignment(1, A). assignment(2, B). assignment(3, C). assignment(4, D). assignment(5, E). </code></pre>  <p>...Where <code>assignment(1, A)</code> means that assignment 1 has a variable grade A (could be 70, could be 50, etc.).</p>  <p>Here is my attempt at getting the sum, just for the first two assignments for testing purposes:</p>  <pre><code>sumAssignments(S) :- assignment(1, A), assignment(2, B), S=A+B. </code></pre>  <p>That always returns yes. The key here is I can't use lists.</p>
