<pre><code>&lt;script language="Javascript"&gt; function monthlyPayment (form) {     var down = form.dPayment.value;     var trade = form.tradeIn.value;     var totalDown = down + trade;  alert ("Total down is " + totalDown); } &lt;/script&gt; </code></pre>  <p>This is a beginner question as I'm new to Javascript... but I am just trying to make a mock up of a feature I'm trying to implement on my website.</p>  <p>I have a form with two user definable variables for 'Down Payment' and 'Trade-In'. Everything in the code works, except for when it "add's" the numbers (such as $100 + $200), it doesn't output $300, but instead $100200. When I change the sign to multiplication it outputs a correct value.</p>  <p>What am I missing? Is there some .sum or .math code I need to implement? Or is my entire script screwed?</p>  <p>Thank you all for your time and help.</p>
