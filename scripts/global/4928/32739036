<p>So I'm still working on my Football manager archive.  Here is the query that results in the total points for every season:  </p>  <pre><code>SELECT p.username, SUM(CASE WHEN m.season_id=4 THEN points END) as 'season14/15', SUM(CASE WHEN m.season_id=5 THEN points END) as 'season15/16', SUM(m.points) AS total_points  FROM  players p INNER JOIN  matchdays m ON p.userid = m.userid GROUP BY p.userid ORDER BY total_points DESC` </code></pre>  <p>The result is:</p>  <pre><code>+----------+-------------+-------------+--------------+ | username | season14/15 | season15/16 | total_points | +----------+-------------+-------------+--------------+ | USER 1   | 1111        | 111         | 1222         | | USER 2   | 999         | 222         | 1221         | | USER 3   | 888         | 333         | 1221         | | USER 4   | 777         | 444         | 1221         | +----------+-------------+-------------+--------------+  </code></pre>  <p>What I am trying to do is, to show the field with the max value. </p>  <p>In this case: User 1 in the season14/15.</p>  <p>Eventually the the Output on the website should be something like:</p>  <p>"The alltime Highscore in a season was USER 1 with 1111 points in season 14/15".</p>  <p>I have tried several things like GREATEST and also subqueries. </p>  <p>No success so far.</p>
