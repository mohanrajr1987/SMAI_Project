<p>I have 3 tables:</p>  <p>USER:</p>  <ul> <li>USERID</li> <li>NAME</li> <li>COMPANY</li> <li>AGE</li> </ul>  <p>QUESTIONS:</p>  <ul> <li>SETID (IDENTIFY ALL QUESTION FROM THE SAME GROUP)</li> <li>QUESTIONID</li> <li>QUESTION (like "Who is the USA's President?")</li> <li>ANSWER "A"</li> <li>ANSWER "B"</li> <li>ANSWER "C"</li> <li>ANSWER "D"</li> <li>CORRECT ANSWER (as CA)</li> </ul>  <p>ANSWERS:</p>  <ul> <li>USERID</li> <li>ANSWERFORQUESTION1 (as AFQ1)</li> <li>ANSWERFORQUESTION2 (as AFQ2)</li> <li>ANSWERFORQUESTION3... (Will be 20 Questions)</li> <li>LAST ANSWER (as LA) &lt;&lt;&lt; I use this to know what is the last answer of each user and post the next answer to him.. (IF 21 = "ALL DONE!")</li> </ul>  <h2>I have 2 issues:</h2>  <p>1-I Need to count the % of "Correct Answers" for each Answer.</p>  <p>2-I Need to count the % of "Correct Answers" for each Answer - for COMPANY "A", COMPANY "B"... (will be 5 companies)</p>  <p>TO SOLVE ISSUE 1:</p>  <pre><code>select      count(DISTINCT ANSWERS.USERID) as TOTAL,      sum(case when ANSWERS.AFQ1 = QUESTIONS.CA AND ANSWERS.LA = 21 AND QUESTIONS.QUESTIONID = 1 then 1 else 0 end) AT1,     sum(case when ANSWERS.AFQ2 = QUESTIONS.CA AND ANSWERS.LA = 21 AND QUESTIONS.QUESTIONID = 2 then 1 else 0 end) AT2,     (....until 20)  from ANSWERS, QUESTIONS Where ANSWERS.LA = 21 </code></pre>  <p>With this I got a Table with TOTAL ANSWERS (COMPLETED = 21) - AND AT1, AT2, AT3.. with each total "correct answers" for each answer.</p>  <p>Then I can do a AT1/TOTAL to get all %.</p>  <p>Issue 1 is ok.</p>  <p>But how I can do the same for Issue 2?</p>  <p>tks!</p>
