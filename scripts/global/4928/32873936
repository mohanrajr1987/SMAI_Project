<p>Let's say we have two tables.</p>  <pre><code>1   0.73 2   0.13 3   0.14 </code></pre>  <p>and</p>  <pre><code>1   1 2   1.465 3   1.181 </code></pre>  <p>I want to somehow loop through them in order to perform </p>  <blockquote>   <p>(0.73*1) + (0.13*1.465) + (0.14 * 1.181) = 1.08579</p> </blockquote>  <p>Or perhaps are there any SQL queries that would help with this?</p>  <p>Update: Here's a sample query. No syntax error, but doesn't seem to be returning anything though.</p>  <pre><code>SELECT      sum(`racemean`.male * `racehazard`.male)  FROM      `racemean`  JOIN      `racehazard` ON `racemean`.male = `racehazard`.male </code></pre>  <p>I'm not sure what format to show sample data, but this is exported from phpMyAdmin.</p>  <p><a href="http://sqlfiddle.com/#!2/b3ac2" rel="nofollow">http://sqlfiddle.com/#!2/b3ac2</a></p>
