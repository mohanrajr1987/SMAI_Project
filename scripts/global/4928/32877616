<p>I have a query like </p>  <pre><code>    sel col1.tb1, col2,tb1, (case &lt;condition involving tb1 and tb2&gt;) as "Dcol1", Sum ( col1.tb3), sum (col2.tb3 ), sum (col3.tb3) etc from tb1 left outer join tb2 &lt;condition&gt; LOJ tb3 &lt;conditions&gt; where tb1 condition and tb2 condition and tb3 condition  group by ( case &lt;condition&gt; , colx.tb2,coly.tb1 </code></pre>  <p>Problem is TB3 is a HUGE fact table.  The PI of the fact table is NOT included in the joins or Queries here. What I have done so far is create a volatile table ( same pi ) and tried to materialize and use it. VT does not have any Sum or group by inside it. Just a vanila VT but it ONLY has cols used in the Qy  and same PI. Its taking time to run but so far the results are not encouraging HOW can I optimize these kinds of queries</p>
