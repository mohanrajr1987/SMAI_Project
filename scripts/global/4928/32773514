<p>I am working through the prep materials for my application to a coding bootcamp. This is a practice problem I am struggling with (using Python):</p>  <p>"Write a function 'lucky_sevens(numbers)', which takes in a list of integers and print True if any three consecutive elements sum to 7. Make sure your code correctly checks for the first and last elements of the array."</p>  <p>I know how to loop through an array one element at a time, but don't know how to "hold" one element while also assessing the second and third elements in relation to the first, as this prompt requires. As you can see from my attempt below, I'm not sure when/where/how to increment the index values to search the whole list. </p>  <pre><code>def lucky_sevens(numbers):  index1 = 0   # For assessing 1st of 3 numbers index2 = index1 + 1   # For assessing 2nd of 3 numbers index3 = index2 + 1   # For assessing 3rd of 3 numbers  # If all index values are within the list... if index1 &lt;= (len(numbers) - 2) and index2 &lt;= (len(numbers) - 1) and index3 &lt;= len(numbers):     # If the values at those indices sum to 7...     if numbers[index1] + numbers[index2] + numbers[index3] == 7:         print True     else:         print False     # I think the increments below may be one of the places I am incorrect     index1 += 1     index2 += 1     index3 += 1 </code></pre>  <p>When I run</p>  <pre><code>lucky_sevens([2, 1, 5, 1, 0]) </code></pre>  <p>It is printing False, I think because it is only considering elements in the 0th, 1st and 2nd positions (sums to 8, not 7, as required). </p>  <p>It should print True, because elements in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd positions sum to 7. (1 + 5 + 1 = 7). </p>  <p>Can anyone please provide a suggestion? I would be most appreciative.</p>
