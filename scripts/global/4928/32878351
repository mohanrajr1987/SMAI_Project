<p>what's the efficient way to sum up every n elements of an array in Scala? For example, if my array is like below:</p>  <pre><code>val arr = Array(3,1,9,2,5,8,...) </code></pre>  <p>and I want to sum up every 3 elements of this array and get a new array like below:</p>  <pre><code>newArr = Array(13, 15, ...) </code></pre>  <p>How can I do this efficiently in Spark Scala? Thank you very much.</p>
