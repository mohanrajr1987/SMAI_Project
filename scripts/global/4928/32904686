<p>This is a program to calculate average grades and I cant figure out whats wrong with my code: </p>  <pre><code>/**  * This program will calculate grade average of user input  * Programmer Tasdiq Chowdhury  *  Date: 10/2/2015  */ import java.util.Scanner;  public class GradeAVG {      public static void main(String[] args) {         avgGrade();     }      public static void avgGrade() {         Scanner keyboard = new Scanner (System.in);         double count = 0;         double avgGrade = 0 ;          double grade;         double total = 0;          System.out.println("Please input the grade");         grade = keyboard.nextDouble();          while(true){             System.out.println("Please input the grade");                        grade= keyboard.nextDouble();             count = count + 1;             if (grade &lt; 0) break;              total += grade;             avgGrade = total/count;         }          System.out.println ("Sum is " +total);         System.out.printf("The average of the  %.0f grades are %.2f " ,count ,avgGrade);     }     } </code></pre>  <p>Output: </p>  <pre><code>Please input the grade 100 Please input the grade 50 Please input the grade -9 Sum is 50.0 The average of the  2 grades are 50.00  </code></pre>  <p>Sum should have been 150 and average 75.</p>
