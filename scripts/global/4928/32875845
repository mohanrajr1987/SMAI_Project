<p>I have the following regional economic data containing estimated output by sector up until 2100, for a variety of growth scenarios. </p>  <p>I want to sum the value of each sector to get a regional output estimate. This requires one to aggregate the output column repeatedly every 46 cells, placing the result in another column (preferably with other information attached too, such as year/scenario ID etc). </p>  <p>As there are >1,000,000 cells it's not a job that can be done by hand. What is the easiest way to sum the regional output across all sectors, by scenario, year and region? </p>  <p>Here's some example data:</p>  <pre><code>scenario  year   region_id region_name  sector_id sector_name   value/output 1A_1C_1C    2000    1   London  2   Mining &amp; quarrying      642.2357178 1A_1C_1C    2000    1   London  3   Food, drink &amp; tobacco   1979.741211 1A_1C_1C    2000    1   London  4   Textiles etc            586.706604 1A_1C_1C    2000    1   London  5   Wood &amp; paper            318.1535339 1A_1C_1C    2000    1   London  6   Printing &amp; recording    1749.062012 ...              1A_1C_1C    2000    2   South East  1   Agriculture etc     771.9697876 1A_1C_1C    2000    2   South East  2   Mining &amp; quarrying  542.2153931 1A_1C_1C    2000    2   South East  3   Food, drink &amp; tob.  1990.234009 1A_1C_1C    2000    2   South East  4   Textiles etc        205.3581085 </code></pre>  <p>EDIT: Can the results please be reported by taking the sum of the output for each region from column 7, and placing them in column 8. Ideally column 9 would then include the specific region name and column 10 would include the specific scenario variant, like this:</p>  <pre><code> Output        Region        Scenario       Year  XXXXXX        London        1A_1C_1C       2000  XXXXXX        South East    1A_1C_1C       2000  ...  XXXXXX        London        1B_1C_1A       2000  XXXXXX        South East    1B_1C_1A       2000  ... </code></pre>  <p>EDIT: Add 'year' to output example</p>
