<p>I don't know how the title should be. Thinking about the title takes more time than writing this question.<br> <strong>to the point</strong><br> Let's assume I have three tables:</p>  <pre><code>//table customers  |  ID  | Name                  | ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ | 194  | PT Comro Haneut       | | 195  | PT Kareueut Kameumeut |  //table customer's savings  |  ID  | IDCustomer | SavingsAmount | +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ |   1  |    194     |    5000000    | |   2  |    195     |     250000    | |   3  |    195     |    2500000    | |   4  |    194     |     125000    | |   5  |    194     |     175000    |  //table transactions |  ID  | IDCustomer | Amount        | +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ |  1   |    195     |    1000000    | |  2   |    195     |     250000    | |  3   |    194     |    3500000    | |  4   |    194     |     300000    | </code></pre>  <p><strong>The Goal</strong><br> I want to sum the amount of savings and the amount of transaction, and make the result in one line, like this :</p>  <pre><code>// expected result of the query | IDCustomer | Savings      | Transactions  | Balance       | +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ |   194      |    5300000   |   4800000     |    500000     | |   195      |    2750000   |   1250000     |   1500000     | </code></pre>  <p>I tried to build the query by my self, but I always failed. I got the total of the amount of savings and transaction was doubled.<br><br></p>  <p>Can anyone help ?</p>
