<p>Good day, I have a table as follows.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZwL0J.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZwL0J.png" alt="Before Adding New Column"></a></p>  <p>What I would love to do is add a new Column that will tabulate/summarize (anyway possible) called "New Net" by CovID/PolicyNo/CovYear/Positive(Negative) values.</p>  <p>In the example below the new  column would look like this. In short, what we are trying to do is SumUp all the Values in that group and only place that total in the first row of that group and zero out all the others.  Any help/pointers would be appreciated with this.  I have tried SQL Server Window Functions, standard SUM/GROUP.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/1Qb8x.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/1Qb8x.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
