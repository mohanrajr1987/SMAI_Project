<p>I'm working in C and using the following code to execute the <code>ps</code> linux command: </p>  <pre><code>char *const parmList[] = {"ps","-o","pid","-g",processGroupID,NULL}; execvp(parmList[0], parmList); </code></pre>  <p>The problem is that it prints all the processes from the group including ones that have been terminated. I need to make sure that the group processes that have <strong>NOT</strong> been terminated are the only ones shown. Is there a way to do this?</p>
