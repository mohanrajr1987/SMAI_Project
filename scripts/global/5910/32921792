<p>I have a situations where I need to kill a process after some time. I start the process and then</p>  <pre><code>case &lt;-time.After(timeout):         if err := cmd.Process.Kill(); err != nil {             return 0, fmt.Errorf("Failed to kill process: %v", err)         } </code></pre>  <p>kills the process. But it only kills the parent process not the 5-10 child processes that main process starts. I also tried creating a process group and then doing</p>  <pre><code>syscall.Kill(-cmd.Process.Pid, syscall.SIGKILL) </code></pre>  <p>to kill main and grandchild processes, but not working. Is there any other way I can kill the processes.</p>
