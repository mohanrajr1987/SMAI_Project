<p>I'm looking for tips on how to further investigate whats going on. The situation is basically:</p>  <p>top shows that my process is using ~10% CPU, meaning that its run for an hour and has only used 6 mins of cpu time. This is a process kicked off by a long python script which logs the command it uses to start the process. When I run that command on the machine, a new process of the same name starts up with 100% cpu utilization. I have no idea why this would happen; anyone have any thoughts, seen anything similar, or any insights on how to debug this further? The fact that starting the exact process up with the same command indicates to me something odd is happening...</p>
