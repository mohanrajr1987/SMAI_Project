<p>I'm new to python, so my question may sound very absurd. Any help would be highly appreciated.</p>  <p>I'm running on windows system.</p>  <p>I have a python file sample.py that is a command line parser(made using argparse). The sample.py file in turn invokes many sub functions like compile,run etc based on parameters passed to file using command prompt.</p>  <pre><code>#sample.py &lt;if command == complie&gt;:call compile function(in another py file) &lt;if command == run&gt;:call run function(in another py file) </code></pre>  <p>To invoke the sample.py file:</p>  <pre><code>cmd&gt; python sample.py --Compile &lt;argument list&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I want that after running above command, the command prompt is returned and python file does it work in background. Once the work is done i get message code compiled.</p>  <p>I want to this since the compile function will take some time and mean while i want to set-up other utilities using sample.py file.</p>
