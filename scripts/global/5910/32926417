<p>I am trying to make a server launcher in my game. I have to launch GameServer.exe with different configs.<br> GameServer.exe GameServer1.cfg<br> GameServer.exe GameServer2.cfg<br> GameServer.exe GameServer3.cfg etc.<br></p>  <p>Here's the current code I have to start each of those .exe's and .cfg's</p>  <pre><code>Private Sub GS1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles GS1.Click     Dim path As String = Directory.GetCurrentDirectory()     Dim gameservercfg As String = GameServer1.Text     Dim newpath As String = path + ("\")     System.Diagnostics.Process.Start(newpath + "GameServer.exe ", gameservercfg) End Sub </code></pre>  <p>And here's my code to restart it by process name.</p>  <pre><code>Private Sub GSRES_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles GSRES.Click     Dim path As String = Directory.GetCurrentDirectory()     Dim gameservercfg As String = GameServer.Text     Dim newpath As String = path + ("\")     Dim p() As Process      p = Process.GetProcessesByName("GameServer")     If p.Count &gt; 0 Then         ' Process is running         Process.GetProcessesByName("GameServer")(0).Kill()         System.Diagnostics.Process.Start(newpath + "GameServer.exe ", gameservercfg)     Else         ' Process is not running         MsgBox("GameServer is not running!")     End If End Sub </code></pre>  <p>With that code, it's restarting random gameservers.<br> Question is, how do I do that by ProcessID instead of Process name?</p>
