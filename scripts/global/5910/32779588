<p>Being new to PHP classes, I'm trying to find out the best way to retrieve values from textfiles (e-mail messages). The textfile is converted line by line into an array. I am processing multiple textfiles in one go. From some textfiles I need to retrieve more information than others, so I have created a class containing all the functions I need. This is (in short) what I have come up with:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php $to_process = array(     '9/24/15 11:03:04 PM    Task Start',     '[...]',     '[...]',     '9/24/15 11:25:54 PM    Task Stop',     '    ',     '    '     );      $message = new process;      $start  = $message-&gt;retrieve_start(to_process);     $stop   = $message-&gt;retrieve_stop(to_process);  class process {      function retrieve_start($arr) {         $start = explode(" ", $arr[0]);         return $this-&gt;$start[1];     }      function retrieve_other($arr) {         // do stuff     }      function retrieve_stop($arr) {         // do other stuff     }  } ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>It does the job, but everytime one of the functions is called, the array is passed to the function. That does not look very efficient to me. How can I make this more efficient?</p>
