<p>One way Jasypt recommends to pass the master key to a Java Application is through an <a href="http://www.jasypt.org/advancedconfiguration.html" rel="nofollow">environment variable</a>.</p>  <p>In that webpage, jasypt proposes that:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>This will allow the user, for example, to set an encryption password in an environment variable, start the application or application server, let the jasypt encryptor object initialise, and then unset the variable (thus hiding it)</p> </blockquote>  <p>How can I accomplish the "unset the variable" part?</p>
