<p>Following is my program which I wrote in order to start a process in linux and print the result in console.</p>  <pre><code>import java.io.BufferedReader; import java.io.IOException; import java.io.InputStream; import java.io.InputStreamReader;  public class Driver {     public static void main(String[] args) {         try {             Process process = new ProcessBuilder("/usr/bin/R").start();             InputStream is = process.getInputStream();             InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(is);             BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);             String line;              while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {                 System.out.println(line);             }           } catch (IOException e) {             e.printStackTrace();         }     } } </code></pre>  <p>I am expecting that the R version and other stuff which will be displayed when I start R in terminal, to be printed in the console. But nothing gets printed and there is no exception.</p>  <p>What is the issue here?</p>  <p>EDIT</p>  <p>My program above works when I use a command like "ls" or "ps". but not for any command which doesn't exit by its own</p>
