<p>I'm building an application that takes data input from a csv text file.  This file is being continually overwritten populated from our ERP system.  We need to understand if there is a delay when the file gets updated.  So I need to know if (for example) this file has not been updated within the last 10 minutes.  </p>  <p>Is there a way that I could create a control or something to continually check this file and report an error if the file has not been updated within a certain time frame?  </p>
