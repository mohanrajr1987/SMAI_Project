<p>So, I'm writing a integration test framework that consists in a back end plus a front end parts. The front end runs in <code>Ruby on Rails</code>, and I start it using a command line:</p>  <pre><code>bundle exec thin start -p 3001 --ssl </code></pre>  <p>I want to execute that command within its own process. Currently I use <code>subprocess</code>:</p>  <pre><code>cmd = bundle exec thin start -p 3001 --ssl subprocess.call([cmd]) </code></pre>  <p>However, <code>subprocess.call</code> will wait until the process returns (which it won't, since it's web server). What I need to have is the Rails server to run on it's own process. How can I have it done? </p>
