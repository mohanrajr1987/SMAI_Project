<p>I am wondering if anyone has done the following:</p>  <ol> <li>Invoking a script from Java servlet. The script is a long running one</li> <li>Once in a while, the user may want to cancel the script. Ideally, if they cancel the request, then the script and any other processes started within should be killed.</li> </ol>  <p>I know how to do step 1. For step 2, is there an elegant way to do it?</p>  <p>One way i can think of is to get the process id of the command within the script when you run it. I can store it in a file. And give another http request url to  kill this process id. Have not tested it. Is there any other way to do this?</p>
