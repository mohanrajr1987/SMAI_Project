<p>I've used the below script a couple of times to kill processes in a vbscript without any issues. </p>  <p>This time I'm trying to kill explorer.exe. Only issue is after I use the script to kill explorer.exe within 2 seconds explorer process restores.</p>  <p>I don't understand ? because if I manually kill explorer.exe with Task Manager, the process is killed until I start the process again. So whats the issue with the below script?</p>  <pre><code>Option Explicit Dim objWMIService, objProcess, colProcess Dim strComputer, strProcessKill  strComputer = "." strProcessKill = "'explorer.exe'"   Set objWMIService = GetObject("winmgmts:" _ &amp; "{impersonationLevel=impersonate}!\\" _  &amp; strComputer &amp; "\root\cimv2")   Set colProcess = objWMIService.ExecQuery _ ("Select * from Win32_Process Where Name = " &amp; strProcessKill ) For Each objProcess in colProcess objProcess.Terminate() Next   WScript.Quit  </code></pre>
