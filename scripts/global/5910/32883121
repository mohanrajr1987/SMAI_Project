<p>Here is a snippet of the output of "man proc"</p>  <pre><code>   (3) state  %c                     One of the following characters, indicating process state:                      R  Running                      S  Sleeping in an interruptible wait                      D  Waiting in uninterruptible disk sleep                      Z  Zombie                      T  Stopped (on a signal) or (before Linux 2.6.33) trace stopped                      t  Tracing stop (Linux 2.6.33 onward)                      W  Paging (only before Linux 2.6.0)                      X  Dead (from Linux 2.6.0 onward)                      x  Dead (Linux 2.6.33 to 3.13 only)                      K  Wakekill (Linux 2.6.33 to 3.13 only)                      W  Waking (Linux 2.6.33 to 3.13 only)                      P  Parked (Linux 3.9 to 3.13 only) </code></pre>  <p>I have a piece of code that has to read the process states from the /proc/pid/stat. I want to extend it to support the new codes (t,x,K,W[waking] and P)</p>  <p>But now with the necessary changes, I don't know how to simulate these codes. I searched exhaustively for definitions of these states and what conditions triggers them. Can someone point out what each of these new codes mean in real life, so that I can try to simulate the scenarios?</p>  <p>PS: Atleast "t" was observed when debugging the process.</p>
