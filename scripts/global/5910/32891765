<p>If I wanted to have multiple child processes, and then feed them some info line by line. (I.E. 1 line to first child, next to second, then the nth+1 back to the first again) how would I do this? I think I would need to use their p_id's but I don't know how I would choose to send to each process in a loop like this.</p>  <pre><code>int main ( int argc, char *argv[] ) {     pid_t pids[10];     int i;     FILE *file = fopen( argv[1], "r" );     char linetoread[256];     int linenumber=1;     int pipefd[2]; //pipe that allows parent to give info to child processes     lineinfo passer;     lineinfo holder;  for (i = 0; i &lt; numproc-1; i++) {     if ((pids[i] = fork()) &lt; 0) {             perror("fork");             abort();     }   else if (pids[i] == 0) {         close (pipefd[1]); //write end unused         holder = read(pipefd[0], &amp;passer, sizeof(passer));         Childwork();                                     exit(0);         } } close (pipefd[0]);  //start of parent while (fgets(line, sizeof(line), file)) {     passer.line=linetoread;     passer.linenum=linenumber;     linenumber++;     write ( pipefd[1],&amp;passer,sizeof(passer)); //need to make this some sort of loop to different child processes.  } </code></pre>  <p>}</p>
