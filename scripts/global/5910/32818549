<p>In erlang it is possible to create a pid which does not correspond to a process. An example using this can be found <a href="http://learnyousomeerlang.com/more-on-multiprocessing#time-out" rel="nofollow">here</a> in Learn You Some Erlang.</p>  <pre><code>pid(0,250,0). </code></pre>  <p>Is there a way to do the same in elixir? The closes I have got at the moment is to create a process that immediately terminates and use that pid.</p>  <pre><code>fake_pid = Process.spawn(fn -&gt; end) </code></pre>  <p>This seams like a bit of a hack, and I am unsure if there might be some slight differences between a never created pid and a dead pid.</p>
