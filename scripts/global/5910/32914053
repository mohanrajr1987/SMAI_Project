<p>I'm reading about operating systems. What exactly does it mean that a process is loaded into its adress space.</p>  <p>I know that each process has its own adress space and that the process only sees virtual adresses.</p>  <p>But I have trouble with the formulation "load into the adress space". What exactly does that mean?</p>  <p>Does it mean that e.g. the variables used by the process are assigned certain virtual memory adresses?</p>
