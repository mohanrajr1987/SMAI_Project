<p>An activity which has a member arraylist. This arraylist will be written by activity and read by its/activity handler.  The data read by the handler sometimes correct and sometimes wrong. This is because the data written by the activity is not synced when handler is reading.</p>  <p>I noticed that the activity and the handler are in different process, even the handler is created by the activity. But the handler is called by another process.</p>  <p>How to make the arraylist data synced/consistent? Thanks.</p>  <p>Code in activity:</p>  <pre><code>private Vector&lt;XMPPConnectionInClientCallback&gt; mCallbackList = new Vector&lt;&gt;();  public interface XMPPConnectionInClientCallback {     void connected(int data);     void logIned(int data);     void disconnected(String data); }  public void addCallback(XMPPConnectionInClientCallback callback) {     Log.e("connectionclient", "addone");     mCallbackList.add(callback);     String strI = String.valueOf(mCallbackList.size());     Log.e("connectionclient", strI); } </code></pre>  <p>handler in activity:</p>  <pre><code>final Messenger mMessenger = new Messenger(new IncomingHandler());  class IncomingHandler extends Handler {     @Override     public void handleMessage(Message msg) {         //synchronized(mCallbackList) {         //get data message from Service Process         int MSGValue = msg.what;         switch (msg.what) {             case XmppService.E_CONNECTION_MESSENGER_VALUE:                 try {                     //callback here                     String strI = String.valueOf(mCallbackList.size());                     Log.e("connectionclient size", strI);                     for (int i = 0; i &lt; mCallbackList.size(); i++) {                         mCallbackList.get(i).connected(MSGValue);                     }                 break; </code></pre>  <p>I called addCallback() first to add one object to mCallbackList, then after a while the service process will send a message to the handler. The handler will will read object from the mCallbackList. mCallbackList sometime has the object, sometime not.  I notice the handler is running in the service process. While addCallback() is running in the main process. </p>
