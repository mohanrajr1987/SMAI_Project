<p>Hello fellow programmers. I am currently making a webpage with the <a href="http://mrdoob.github.io/three.js/examples/canvas_geometry_birds.html" rel="nofollow">three.js 3D library: birds</a>. However, I can't seem to get these two things right.</p>  <p>1) When you load the page, you can see the birds are all going to the center of the page. I want it to have it like <a href="http://www.thewildernessdowntown.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.thewildernessdowntown.com</a>: here are the birds coming from the sides of your screen. How can I do this?</p>  <p>2) thewildernessdowntown also have the birds flying in large groups. The original script does not have this. How can I create it so they all fly in large groups?</p>  <p>Thank you for your answers in advance!</p>
