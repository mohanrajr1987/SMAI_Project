<p>I'm using fabric.js.  I would like to get the dimensions of the rectangle (is "bounding box" the correct term?) that exactly contains the text (represented by the red box below).  The default fabric.js box has padding even if I change padding to 0. </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/etxBD.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/etxBD.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I tried to get the context from the fabric canvas and then call .measureText() but it didn't give the full information I needed for a bounding box.</p>
