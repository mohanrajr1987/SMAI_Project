<p>I have created a sprite animation using html5's canvas element and everything works  well but it seem it looks ugly when compared to IE's rendering. When playing the animation in chrome, I keep displaying random additional white lines while trying to render the appropriate image using drawImage(). I don't experience these difficulties with IE.</p>  <p>Thoughts on how I can solve this? </p>
