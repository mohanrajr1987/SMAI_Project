<p>I'm wondering if I can freely transform a rectangle/four point polygon in Fabric.js like this: </p>  <p><a href="http://www.html5.jp/test/perspective_canvas/demo1_en.html" rel="nofollow">See external Link</a></p>  <p>I have a slight idea of how to do it manually:</p>  <ol> <li>Detect polygon corners and display them with handles (picture and tutorial by kangax, found at <a href="http://www.scriptscoop.com/t/b1a45e8c74ee/javascript-polygon-corner-points-in-fabric-js.html" rel="nofollow">Scriptscoop</a>)</li> </ol>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/chGsq.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/chGsq.png" alt="Polygon"></a></p>  <ol start="2"> <li>Detect mouse-dragging-events from there</li> <li>Repaint polygon while in dragging-process with current mouse-coordinates</li> </ol>  <p>But as these are mostly basic Fabric.js-features for normal shapes, I'm wondering if it is already implemented? Or are there already implemented methods that help me with this task? I can't discover something in the docs...</p>  <p>Although I'd love using Fabric.js I'm not ungrateful if somebody knows a framework which supports these free transformations out of the box.</p>
