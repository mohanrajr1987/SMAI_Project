<p>I have this simple shooting canvas game which runs just fine. But my issue is that I want the image to do the shooting and not the blue rectangle? , so how I can make my image move and shoot the orange rectangles that come down? Here's my code. Please help. Thank you so much!    </p>  <pre><code>function initCanvas(){ var ctx = document.getElementById('my_canvas').getContext('2d'); var img = document.getElementById("nave"); var myImage = new Image(); myImage.src = "pic.gif"; ctx.drawImage(myImage,10,10); var cW = ctx.canvas.width, cH = ctx.canvas.height; </code></pre>
