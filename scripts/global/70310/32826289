<p>I'm a begginer with canvas element but my research on google didn't go well... So, I have my canvas element and I draw a lot of rectangles in my canvas.</p>  <p>Currently, when I click in my shape I'm able to display an alert message like 'You clicked on the rectangle 54'. But I don't want to display an alert box. I want to display a menu with some options like 'Delete' or 'More details'...</p>  <p>I found a tons of article about a menu on javascript on html element but nothing about canvas... I Found only something working with Firefox...</p>  <p>Is there a way to do that?</p>  <p>At the moment I think, I will draw a new rectangle displaying the options, but it looks like a bit dirty and i'm affraid about conflict event...</p>  <p>Thank you in advance.</p>
