<p>Is it possible to somehow make "find" (ctrl+f) work if you are writing text inside a Canvas?</p>  <p>I checked out the basic examples at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Drawing_text" rel="nofollow">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Drawing_text</a> and when searching for "hello world" in chrome the canvas text is not hilighted.</p>  <p>Is there anyway of doing this?</p>  <p>If there isn't, has anyone seen an implementation of a "box-and-lines" chart (like UML) only using the DOM? (since then native find text would be supported)</p>
