<p>I've read that you can't really protect client files since in the end, no matter how you uglify/encrypt/whatever, it can be reversed. And until today I thought that was a true. I usually download things to toy with them or to understand how they were made, but this one:</p>  <p><a href="http://stars.chromeexperiments.com/" rel="nofollow">http://stars.chromeexperiments.com/</a></p>  <p>Won't save locally. No matter what kind of download technique I use I always end up with nothing. So instead of understanding how the stars from chromeexperiments were made, now I would like to know how to protect my projects the same way.</p>
