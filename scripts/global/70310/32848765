<p>Recently a Chrome extension our company uses was reported to be causing extreme slow down in the UI when in use. Ive been trying to find the cause of this issue.</p>  <p>After a week or two I have narrowed it down to the canvas's drawImage method.</p>  <p>Initial thought was that this method was holding onto the thread for too long.</p>  <p>This extension works great up to Chrome V43 (couldn't find chrome V44 anyway). With the current version 45, it causes heavy delay on UI response. Seems like a chrome bug.</p>  <p>Googling around I found this <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?can=2&amp;start=0&amp;num=100&amp;q=&amp;colspec=ID%20Pri%20M%20Stars%20ReleaseBlock%20Cr%20Status%20Owner%20Summary%20OS%20Modified&amp;groupby=&amp;sort=&amp;id=490478" rel="nofollow">https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?can=2&amp;start=0&amp;num=100&amp;q=&amp;colspec=ID%20Pri%20M%20Stars%20ReleaseBlock%20Cr%20Status%20Owner%20Summary%20OS%20Modified&amp;groupby=&amp;sort=&amp;id=490478</a></p>  <p>I am not sure if this is exactly the issue I am running into with drawImage but taking the suggestion from someone who posted there, I went into chrome://flags/ and disabled "Disable accelerated 2D canvas". </p>  <p>This instantly solved the issue &amp; the extension is actually working better than ever before. The question is why? and how can this be used to make a temporary fix to the code since it'd be unreasonable to just ask everyone to disable this flag.</p>
