<p>I am developing a Windows 10 UWP app with Visual Studio 2015. I am working on the back button functionality right now. Unfortunately there is a problem. When I press the back button (either on a Phone or on the PC) it doesn't go back to the previous page. When I press it again it works.</p>  <p>It is like this example:</p>  <ol> <li>Start App (page 1)</li> <li>Go to page 2</li> <li>Go to page 3</li> <li>Click back button (nothing happens)</li> <li>Click back button (it goes to page 2)</li> <li>Click back button (it goes to page 1)</li> </ol>  <p>So the first time when you want to go back it needs two presses... why? Additionally I've found out that the first press doesn't trigger the back button event. But why?</p>  <p>I am using the implementation as described in this article: <a href="http://www.wintellect.com/devcenter/jprosise/handling-the-back-button-in-windows-10-uwp-apps" rel="nofollow">http://www.wintellect.com/devcenter/jprosise/handling-the-back-button-in-windows-10-uwp-apps</a></p>
