<p>I would like to be notified of the button power being pressed on Android. To be clear, I am not looking to override the power button event, but simply being notified of when it has happened. From everything I've researched so far, there is no such thing in Android. Please let me know if there is, or if there is one planned for Android's near future.</p>  <p>Until now, I have been using screen on/off broadcasts in order to essentially guess that the power button has been pressed. However, since KK Watch (API 20) or Lollipop (API 21), even this, is no longer accurate. This is because although the broadcast is still named ACTION_SCREEN_ON , they no longer refer to when the screen turned on but instead when the device became "interactive", which can be delayed compared to when the screen actually came on. The same is true for ACTION_SCREEN_OFF, it actually refers to when the device is no longer in interactive mode, not exactly when the screen turned off. </p>  <p>The Display class has some different display states which do actually refer to the screen state: STATE_OFF, STATE_ON, STATE_DOZE, STATE_DOZE_SUSPEND, or STATE_UNKNOWN. You can get the display state with getState() but there's no sort of broadcast system to notify that the state has changed, as far as I know.</p>  <p>Does anyone know a way to get more accurately notified of the power button being pressed or the screen changing state? If it comes down to it, I wouldn't mind a root solution either.</p>
