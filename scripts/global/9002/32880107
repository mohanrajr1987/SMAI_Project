<p>I am having problems with testing my app. I created an espresso test which is supposed to fail, since whenever I launch my app in the emulator, I get the expected behavior. There is my test:</p>  <pre><code> onView(withText("wrong answer")).perform(click());  onView(withId(R.id.nextQuestionButton)).check(matches(isEnabled())); </code></pre>  <p>When launching the test, nothing is reported, whereas nextQuestionButton should <strong>not</strong> be enabled upon clicking the radioButton whose text is "wrong answer".</p>
