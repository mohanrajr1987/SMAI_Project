<p>I have a room full of sales representatives. Currently, when they make a sale, they write it on the board and ring a bell next to the board. Lately we've been too busy for them to get up and ring the bell. I would like to have a small window or application open on their computer that has a button and then I have a separate window or application open that when they click the button it makes a bell sound. I do not want this to play on the other reps computers - just mine. Does anyone have any ideas on how this can be done?</p>
