<p>I have a picturebox in my system that displays a thumbnail image from a <code>List&lt;Bitmap&gt;</code> called <code>images</code>. There is a button on either side of the picturebox that allows the user to move to the previous or next image. What I would like to happen is that when the picturebox is on the first image of the List, then the 'previous' button is disabled, and same for the last image and the 'next' button. At any other time, the user should be able to scroll in either direction.  I have written a function called <code>checkFirstLast()</code> to try and implement this, and am testing it with only two elements in the <code>images</code> List. The function is shown below, and is called every time the image on the picturebox is changed:</p>  <pre><code>    //Bitmap passed in represents image currently displayed on picbox     public void checkFirstLast(Bitmap displayImage)     {         if (displayImage == images.First())         {             //cant go back             //set prev button as inactive             btnPrevImage.Enabled = false;             btnPrevImage.BackColor = INACTIVECOLOUR;              //can go forward             //set next button as active             btnNextImage.Enabled = true;             btnNextImage.BackColor = ACTIVECOLOUR;         }         else if (displayImage == images.Last())         {             //can go back             //set prev button as active             btnPrevImage.Enabled = true;             btnPrevImage.BackColor = ACTIVECOLOUR;              //cant go forward             //set next button as inactive             btnNextImage.Enabled = false;             btnNextImage.BackColor = INACTIVECOLOUR;         }         else         {             //can go back             //set prev button as active             btnPrevImage.Enabled = true;             btnPrevImage.BackColor = ACTIVECOLOUR;              //can go forward             //set next button as active             btnNextImage.Enabled = true;             btnNextImage.BackColor = ACTIVECOLOUR;         }     } </code></pre>  <p>When the application loads, it loads to the first element in the <code>images</code>, and the <code>checkFirstLast()</code> function is run. This means that at this point, the 'previous' button is disabled while the 'next' button is enabled. However, when the 'next' button is clicked (<code>checkFirstLast()</code> run again) and the picturebox shows the second (last) element in <code>images</code>, neither button changes enabled state as it should. This means that the system becomes stuck on the last element in the List and can go neither backwards (button not enabled), nor forwards (no more images, although button stays enabled).</p>  <p>I don't really understand what could be going wrong, surely if the function operates as expected first time around then it can't just not work when called again? Not sure where to go from here, any advice or a point in the direction of where to look would be greatly appreciated.</p>  <p>Thanks in Advance, Mark</p>
