<p>I have over 30 buttons and 30 images inside of a switch statement, 4 buttons showing at the same time.  I want to perform an IBAction depending on which button is pressed.  It's not allowing me to drag &amp; drop it into the case inside my switch statement.  The buttons change depending on what image is showing.  For every image, there are 3 wrong buttons, and 1 correct button.  How can I check for which button is pressed, and add a resulting action?</p>
