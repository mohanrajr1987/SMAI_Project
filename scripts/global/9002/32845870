<p>I want to make a UI that gives the player the option to continue playing the game (closing out the menu), or to go to the main menu. The code worked fine before, but today, I loaded it up, and saw that all my code was not compiling due to a different script I was working on. So, I removed the script components, and tried again.</p>  <p>I followed the <a href="http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/798406/unity-46-button-onclicks-functions-not-showing.html" rel="nofollow">recommended advice listed here</a>, and it worked before - but now it is not working. I have no idea what I did wrong. Attached are some pictures I took, along with the code. Any and all help would be greatly appreciated.</p>  <pre><code>/// &lt;summary&gt; /// This class controls the 'Resume Game' Button. When the button is pressed, it removes the menu, and allows the game to continue. /// &lt;/summary&gt;  public class ResumeButton : MonoBehaviour {      public bool isPaused = false;     public GameObject menu;      public void ResumeButtonClicked()     {         Time.timeScale = 1;         menu.SetActive(isPaused);             print("It is not paused!");             isPaused = false;     }      public void MainMenuButton()//There is only one button in the scene, this was code I was planning to add in. I am keeping it in here just in case it has any effect on the answer.     {         Application.LoadLevel("TestScene2");     } } </code></pre>  <p>Methods Not Appearing:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ey1fG.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ey1fG.png" alt="Methods Not Appearing"></a></p>
