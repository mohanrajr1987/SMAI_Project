<p>I am sorry if this is a silly question, I am new to json data and new to android and programming in general. </p>  <p>What I have in mind is, for example to utilize json data like this:</p>  <pre><code>[     {         name: "Test",         type: "Liquid",         amount: 13,         stat: 1     } ] </code></pre>  <p>Just a random example. What I wish to achieve with it is that in app, there is a button for "stat" that switches it from 1 to 0 or vice versa, and to show a panel where it reads the "amount". Is that possible to achieve?</p>  <p>Much appreciated</p>
