<p>Thank you for your answer. I am writing an Android application with the Java programming language. Make sure you have seen the Amazon Kindle application-specific list of books with photographs and with a fever, they are open I am looking for a key in the user interface. As well as regular features dedicated keys to vary slightly in shape with the rest of the program is more and more attractive. Respondents thank you</p>
