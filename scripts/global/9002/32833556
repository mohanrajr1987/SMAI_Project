<p>I am trying to automate button click to "www.truecaller.com" , but there are 2 issues :  - I can not get the button ID.  - seems that this button is always disabled. if I enter data manually to the phone number textbox , it is enabled. But if I filled data to this textbox automatically from my application , it will always stay disabled.</p>  <p>Thanks for support. </p>  <p>Walid</p>
