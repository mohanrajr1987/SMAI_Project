<p>I'm still kind of new to android. I'm writing a Tic Tac Toe game as a bit of practice. I'm trying to figure out how to replace views when I click a button. I have 9 buttons in a GridView. When a user clicks one, I want that to change to a non-clickable TextView and back to Button when a user click's the reset Button at the bottom of the screen.. I use a flag to keep track of player's turn so it'll know whether or not place an x or o. Is this even possible or am I stretching here? </p>
