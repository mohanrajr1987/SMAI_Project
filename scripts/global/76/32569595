<p>Consider many (10s or 100s of millions) of fairly short (around 100 ascii character) strings that contain many repeated sub-strings. I'd like to use the strings in a Python program, but compress them to save space. Most compression algorithms, like Lempelâ€“Ziv (LZ), use a lookup table to encode compressed data. Is there a way to use an existing compression library (like <a href="http://www.zlib.net/" rel="nofollow">zlib</a>, <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/zlib.html" rel="nofollow">zlib module</a>) to do this? In pseudo code, to compress the data one would make the calls</p>  <pre><code>table = zlib.makeTable( data ) foreach string:     compressedString = zlib.compressString( table, string ) </code></pre>  <p>and then store the compressed strings.</p>
