<p>I have a large HTML file, which I serve compressed using gzip. I've noticed the browser starts to display content from the file before the HTTP response is complete. You can mimic this on the command line:</p>  <pre><code>curl -v -H 'Accept-Encoding: gzip' --limit-rate 2K 'http://www.theguardian.com/uk' | gzip --decompress </code></pre>  <p>I'm trying to understand how the browser can do this. My understanding of compression is the whole file is compressed, and you would need a complete response to decompress it, but that is obviously not correct.</p>  <p>How does the browser manage to decompress the response in "chunks"? Is this to do with the compression technique?</p>
