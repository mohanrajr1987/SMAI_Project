<p>on windows 10, the camstudio lossless compressor not working. To record windows edge browser about 1100*700, the avi size is 60M for one minute. The recording shows the compressor used. </p>  <p>When playing the recorded avi file, recording it only takes 10M with the same options. What is the difference?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
