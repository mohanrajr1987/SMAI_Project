<p>I'm taking a multimedia course this semester, and we have a lecture about compression. </p>  <p>In the reasons to compress it says: </p>  <pre><code>-Allow real-time transfer at a given data rate. </code></pre>  <p>I Could not understand what does real- time transfer mean?  Can anyone explain it to me please?</p>
