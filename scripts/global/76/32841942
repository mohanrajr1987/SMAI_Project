<p>Reading the article <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/innodb-compression-internals.html" rel="nofollow">How Compression Works for InnoDB Tables</a> article I only find examples with data types like <code>BLOB</code>, <code>VARCHAR</code> and <code>TEXT</code>. Of course compression works best for these since you often have repeating patterns (at least for the character based types).</p>  <p>But how does it look for number or date columns (in my case <code>INT</code> and <code>DATETIME</code>)? Can these types be compressed as well and what would be the best <code>KEY_BLOCK_SIZE</code>?</p>  <p>I have a table which looks like the following:</p>  <pre><code>pk (INT) | account_id (INT) | time (DATETIME) ---------+------------------+--------------------        1 |                1 | 2015/09/29 12:00:01        2 |                1 | 2015/09/29 12:00:05        3 |                2 | 2015/09/29 12:03:12        4 |                2 | 2015/09/29 13:49:34        5 |                4 | 2015/09/29 13:37:42 </code></pre>
