<p>I've been researching multiple sources over the last couple days on Kolmogorov complexity and I just can't understand the basic principles. I get that it's the shortest description of that object but I read you can't actually calculate it and that confuses me. so if someone could give me a nice simple explanation of it that would be very helpful. </p>
