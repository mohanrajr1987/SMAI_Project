<p>I am using zlib library to compress my files for my project. I have a compressed file content having 204 chars length. when I tried to write the files in 2 different ways I am getting different chars length as the contents in the file.</p>  <p>When I used ,</p>  <pre><code>FILE* dest = fopen("D:\File.gz", "w"); to open the destination file </code></pre>  <p>and writes using</p>  <pre><code>int count = fwrite(buffer, 1, size, dest); </code></pre>  <p>The final file content length becomes 205.</p>  <p>When I used,</p>  <pre><code>FILE * dest = stdout; and  int count = fwrite(buffer, 1, size, dest); </code></pre>  <p>I got the correct file size as 204. </p>  <p>Why I am getting 2 different behaviours? When using the first method, the file created is not able to decompress, and shows invalid zip file.</p>
