<p>I need to greatly reduce the filesize of a large set of jpg images created by a java program. I thought video should be best choice and in particular mp4. but, I don't know why <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32190433/jcodec-mp4-compress-is-increasing-filesize">the size of mp4 video with h.264 codec is bigger than the size of the image set</a> in the only implementation I found, so I made my own archive format that is basically the imageset merged together in 1 file and compressed with <a href="https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java" rel="nofollow">Snappy</a>, plus the info for split them again. so the question are:</p>  <ol> <li>Does anyone know a good compression video encoder for java?</li> <li>Does anyone know why in that implementation the file growth and avoid it?</li> <li>currently basing on test I found snappy is reducing size by 15-20%, i know that jpg is already a compressed format and miracles in further compressing can't be done but i'm trying, so if the previous 2 point fail, someone know how minimize the file size in other ways than video?</li> </ol>  <p>EDIT: the jpg single images are already greatly compressed so i don't need a jpg algorithm.</p>
