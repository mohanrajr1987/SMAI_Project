<p>this code takes a bunch of files in a folder (based on the file name), zips them into bz2 and adds them into a tar file. Is there a way I can modify this to only compress the files into bz2 (or gzip)? I do not want to have to deal with having them packaged into a tar. I just want to go through each file in a directory and compress it.</p>  <pre><code>import os from glob import glob import tarfile  os.chdir(r'C:\Documents\FTP\\') compression = "w:bz2" extension = '.tar.bz2'  filename = 'survey_' filetype = 'survey_report_*.csv' tarname = saveloc+filename+extension files = glob(filetype) tar = tarfile.open(tarname, compression) for file in files:     if file not in tarname:         print('Packaging file:', file)         tar.add(file) tar.close() </code></pre>  <p>EDIT:</p>  <p>This code seems to work for some files, but for other ones it makes them 1kb and when I open it there are just some random characters. Any suggestions?</p>  <hr>  <pre><code>import bz2 import os  location = r'C:\Users\Documents\FTP\\' os.chdir(location) filelist = os.listdir(location) for file in filelist:     data = open(file).read()     try:         output = bz2.BZ2File(file + '.bz2', 'wb')         output.write(data)     finally:         output.close() </code></pre>
