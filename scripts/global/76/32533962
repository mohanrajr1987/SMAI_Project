<p>I am in the middle of developing an app for android / ios and web. User can upload a video that's meant for a group. And members of the group should be able to see the video or download it like whatsapp does it. I don't mind compressing the video with little loss. Speed of upload and download is crucial. What are my best options? I am thinking of using youtube APIs to do everything as it might make things much easier. And I hope I can make the video private while uploading using APIs.  But this means the data is with youtube server. I prefer that data sits on our server. What are my other options ? Any library / SDK that works with both ios and android ? I dont have a whole lot of time to develop this. Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>
