<p>I am impressed how Facebook and Twitter compress their images with out losing the quality.I would like to post my images for example but i don't have enough reputation to post images. My 680kb image is compressed to 68 kb by Facebookand to 33kb by Twitter.How are they achieving this? "What are the technologies they are using to compress images"?IF I want to hire some people to compress images in which technologies do i need to search?</p>
