<p>I have been experimenting with Python recently, and have just discovered the power of Dict Comprehensions. I read about them a bit in Python's reference library. Here is the example that I found on them:</p>  <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; {x: x**2 for x in (2, 4, 6)}     {2:4, 4:16, 6:36} </code></pre>  <p>For my mini project, I have this code:</p>  <pre><code>def dictIt(inputString):     counter = 0     output = {counter: n for n in inputString}     return output </code></pre>  <p>However, I want the counter to increment by 1 every loop, so I tried to rely on sort-of-educated guesses like the following:</p>  <pre><code>def dictIt(inputString):     counter = -1     output = {counter++: n for n in inputString}     return output </code></pre>  <p>and</p>  <pre><code>def dictIt(inputString):     counter = 0     output = {counter: n for n in inputString: counter++}     return output </code></pre>  <p>etc, but none of my guesses worked. </p>  <p>This is the desired I/O:</p>  <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print dictIt("Hello")     {0:"H", 1:"e", 2:"l", 3:"l", 4:"o"} </code></pre>  <p>How would I be able to achieve what I am aiming for?</p>  <p>Thanks a lot in advance! All responses are greatly appreciated!</p>
