<p>I want to make app that will compress video( video is 3 sec long (about 5mb), and I want to compress it to 2 or 2,5 mb). I'm using mp4. I'm new into compressing. I heard that you can use FFmpeg or Mediacodec. I don't want to use FFmpeg or any library where you need to pay.  If you can use Mediacodec for free, then I want to ask you if you can put code for video compression(decoder/encoder) and if possible arguments in code, so I could understand what some parts of code do. </p>
