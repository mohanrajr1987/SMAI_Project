<p>I understand that R doesn't have a floating point format in single precision. However, I'm writing a very large number of data points from R to file, and I'd like to store them as single precision floats, rather than double precision. I don't need good accuracy on these numbers.</p>  <p>Any way I can do that? I want to save as much space as possible, and even compression or dumping as binary isn't enough.</p>  <p>Edit: Is there a way to write .rds files as single precision floats?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
