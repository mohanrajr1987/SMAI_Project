<p>I'm using <code>FileReader</code> to display in a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> a file uploaded with an input type file. When the file is dropped in the field, I need to compressed the file and resize him. I used this code :</p>  <pre><code>var width = source_img_obj.naturalWidth; var height = source_img_obj.naturalHeight; var quality = 90;  var maxWidth = 2000; // Max width for the image var maxHeight = 2000;    // Max height for the image var ratio = 0;  // Used for aspect ratio  // Check if the current width is larger than the max if (width &gt; maxWidth){     ratio = maxWidth / width;   // get ratio for scaling image     height = height * ratio;    // Reset height to match scaled image     width = width * ratio;    // Reset width to match scaled image }  // Check if current height is larger than max if (height &gt; maxHeight){     ratio = maxHeight / height; // get ratio for scaling image     width = width * ratio;    // Reset width to match scaled image     height = height * ratio;    // Reset height to match scaled image }  var cvs = document.createElement('canvas'); cvs.width = width; cvs.height = height; var ctx = cvs.getContext("2d").drawImage(source_img_obj, 0, 0, width, height); var newImageData = cvs.toDataURL(mime_type, quality/100); var result_image_obj = new Image(); result_image_obj.src = newImageData; </code></pre>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong> : FULL code is <a href="http://pastebin.com/0SvDmXMf" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>  <p>The finished file compressed is saved in <code>result_image_obj</code>, but before display this base64 image, I need to check the size of the final picture. So if the size is larger than 500kb I need to compress again the picture. </p>  <p>Is there a way to get the size (b, kb, mb..) of a base64 picture generated by canvas ?</p>  <p>Another question : Can we get the orientation of the picture uploaded with FileReader ? Because with some device portait picture are displayed in landscape orientation.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
