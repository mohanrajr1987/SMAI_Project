<p>In Fedora, I was trying to compress some files using the GUI itself, not the terminal. So I opened the nautilus, selected the files, press the right button and choose compress. This way Fedora opened the File Roller, select the destination folder and start to compress. No alarms or warnings appeared. After some time appear a message saying that was not enough disk space. Ok, I wonder why it don't warn me before....but Ok, it's a compress process, maybe it's complicated to determine the size of the final compressed file....whatever..</p>  <p>But now, it appears for me that my disk is full. The place I choose for destination is empty (I've already tried look for hidden files also). I was thinking about the File Roller compress my files in a temp folder and after that he copies to my destination folder. How the error happen, this temp files are lost somewhere filling my disk.</p>  <p>Anyone know how do I clean this files?</p>  <p>Edit: It's more probable that this junk files really exists? Or could be just the system that don't refreshed the file system? If so, how do I recreate this index of my disk?</p>  <p>Thanks a lot. I'm stuck at the moment in my work with this disk space problem....</p>
