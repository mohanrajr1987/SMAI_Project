<p>I need to create a function called compress that compresses a string by replacing any repeated letters with a letter and number. My function should return the shortened version of the string. I've been able to count the first character but not any others.</p>  <p>Ex:</p>  <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; compress("ddaaaff") 'd2a3f2'    def compress(s):      count=0       for i in range(0,len(s)):          if s[i] == s[i-1]:              count += 1          c = s.count(s[i])       return str(s[i]) + str(c) </code></pre>
