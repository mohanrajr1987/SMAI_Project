<p>Curiosity is one of my personal keys. I got a folder of an executable c application, this folder include many files some are files.so , files.ini and other files.lz and I decided to try do some kind of reverse engineering, so I have used a reverse engineering online tool for the files.so and files.ini are already opened via notepad as we all know, but now my problem is about opening files.lz, which i already know that it contains libraries to be used for functions on files.so</p>  <p>This is what i want to know and to have some help in it how can I decompress it via a desktop tool or even an online tool?</p>
