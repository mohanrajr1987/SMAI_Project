<p>I have a series of SQL scripts. I want to use Python to read each of those files and execute that code against Netezza. Here's what I've got so far, but it doesn't seem to actually do anything.</p>  <p>My SQL script (this table starts with plenty data in it, just want to test if I can truncate it for now. The actual code I plan to run will continue by creating new tables and executing other SQL):</p>  <pre><code>/* DROP THE OLD BACKUP */  TRUNCATE TABLE DB_LAB..MY_TEST ; </code></pre>  <p>My Python code:</p>  <pre><code>import pyodbc  cnxn = pyodbc.connect('DSN=DB_LAB') cursor = cnxn.cursor()  sql_example = "F:\\My Documents\\test_sql.txt"  infile = open(sql_example ,'r')  lines = infile.readlines()  print lines  &gt;&gt;&gt;['/* DROP THE OLD BACKUP */ \n',  'TRUNCATE TABLE DB_LAB..MY_TEST\n',  ';\n']   sql = (' '.join(lines))  cnxn.execute(sql) cnxn.close() </code></pre>  <p>After I execute this code I get no errors but MY_TEST hasn't been truncated.</p>
