<p>I'm new to MongooseIM and I am connecting it to MySQL. My issue is when blocking a user the application let me continue sending messages to that contact. </p>  <p>I can see in the application that the user is blocked but I can not see stored data in the database. I am not sure how mongoose is storing blocked users and how it knows is a blocked user even when it is not storing data in MySQL.</p>  <p>I have this configuration in ejabberd.cfg:</p>  <pre><code>{mod_privacy, [{backend,odbc}]}, </code></pre>  <p>Other modules work fine and save information in MySQL with this configuration.</p>  <p>My questions are how MongooseIM handles blocking users? and what should I configure in order to block them?</p>
