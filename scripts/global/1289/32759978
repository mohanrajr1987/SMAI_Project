<p>This question is based on on this one: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25863473/how-to-increase-performance-for-bulk-inserts-to-odbc-linked-tables-in-access">How to increase performance for bulk INSERTs to ODBC linked tables in Access?</a></p>  <p>I have further queston for the linked topic above, since I do not have enough score to comment on the topic, so I created my question here. </p>  <p>With the excellent answer from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/2144390/gord-thompson">Gord Thompson</a>, who provided the following codes in the link above. </p>  <pre><code>Sub PtqTest() Dim cdb As DAO.Database, rst As DAO.Recordset Dim t0 As Single, i As Long, valueList As String, separator As String  t0 = Timer Set cdb = CurrentDb Set rst = cdb.OpenRecordset("SELECT MPO_REFERENCE FROM tblTempSmartSSP", dbOpenSnapshot) i = 0 valueList = "" separator = "" Do Until rst.EOF     i = i + 1     valueList = valueList &amp; separator &amp; "(" &amp; rst!MPO_REFERENCE &amp; ")"     If i = 1 Then         separator = ","     End If     If i = 1000 Then         SendInsert valueList         i = 0         valueList = ""         separator = ""     End If     rst.MoveNext Loop If i &gt; 0 Then     SendInsert valueList End If rst.Close Set rst = Nothing Set cdb = Nothing Debug.Print "Elapsed time " &amp; Format(Timer - t0, "0.0") &amp; " seconds." End Sub  Sub SendInsert(valueList As String) Dim cdb As DAO.Database, qdf As DAO.QueryDef  Set cdb = CurrentDb Set qdf = cdb.CreateQueryDef("") qdf.Connect = cdb.TableDefs("METER_DATA").Connect qdf.ReturnsRecords = False qdf.sql = "INSERT INTO METER_DATA (MPO_REFERENCE) VALUES " &amp; valueList qdf.Execute dbFailOnError Set qdf = Nothing Set cdb = Nothing End Sub </code></pre>  <p>My question is what if I want to include multiple columns during the insert? For example, apart from MPO_REFERENCE, I have other column named NEW_COLUMN wants to be inserted to METER_DATA  (odbc linked table from sql server), and I tried following modifications on some of the lines in above codes but failed. Sorry I am new to SQL and VB, much appreciate if someone can help. Thanks. </p>  <pre><code>    ...     Set rst = cdb.OpenRecordset("SELECT MPO_REFERENCE,NEW_COLUMN FROM tblTempSmartSSP", dbOpenSnapshot)     ...     ...         valueList = valueList &amp; separator &amp; "(" &amp; rst!MPO_REFERENCE &amp; "," &amp; rst!NEW_COLUMN &amp; ")"      ...     ...     qdf.sql = "INSERT INTO METER_DATA (MPO_REFERENCE,NEW_COLUMN) VALUES " &amp; valueList      ... </code></pre>
