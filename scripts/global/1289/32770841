<p>I'm using jet essentials on office 365 excel and the sql db is linked with a crm nav 2013. The problem is strictly with a single workstation because other workstations are able to connect to the server to generate reports. I am getting the following error below when trying to run a report using Jet Essentials and I do have the latest and required drivers under my ODBC data source: SQL Server Native Client 11.0. When I searched online, it was mentioned that the problem is with the ODBC - SQL Native Client but I have the required version install. What could be causing the disconnect in db communication?</p>  <p>Provider cannot be found. It may not be properly installed.   System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException    at ADODB.ConnectionClass.Open(String ConnectionString, String UserID, String Password, Int32 Options)    at Jet.Data.Ado.AdoDataSource.a..ctor(String connectionString)</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
