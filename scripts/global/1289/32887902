<p>I've built a WooCommerce store for a client of mine.</p>  <p>Now they've asked me for an additional functionality.</p>  <p>They use a software called Tally.ERP 9 which is an accounting software for small and medium businesses. They've asked to make this software sync with WooCommerce.</p>  <p>From the Tally site I see that it provides ODBC functionality and I was wondering if this would be enough to sync it with WooCommerce.</p>  <p>My knowledge in databases is limited and I need your help to proceed with this.</p>
