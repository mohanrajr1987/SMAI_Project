<p>I have scoured Stack Overflow and the internet in general for steps leading to an answer, but have as of yet been unsuccessful.  My main goal is to use ASP scripts with MS SQL databases on my standalone Win7 PC, but the short term goal is to be able to configure an ODBC User or File DSN connection that tests successfully in the ODBC Data Source Administrator.</p>  <p>I have SQL Server 2012 installed and can successfully connect to the database engine from SQL Server Management Studio.</p>  <p>When I try to configure a DSN entry in ODBC, the error message reads </p>  <blockquote>   <p>[Microsoft][SQL Server Native Client 11.0]Named Pipes Provider: Could not open a connection to SQL Server [53]. </p> </blockquote>  <p>All attempts to test the data source lead to a  15-second time-out with the TESTS FAILED! message.</p>  <p>I have tried all of the usually recommended adjustments.  What other details could I provide?  HELP!!</p>
