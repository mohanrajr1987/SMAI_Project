<p>What I have:</p>  <ul> <li>a 64-bit SQL Server 2012 installed on Windows Server 2008R2</li> <li>32-bit ODBC driver SyBase ASE 12.5.1 (and I have no ability to obtain any other official driver)</li> </ul>  <p>What I need:</p>  <ul> <li>access from SQL Server to SyBase <code>Adaptive Server Enterprise/12.5.4/EBF 14921 ESD#7/P/RS6000/AIX 5.1/ase1254/2095/64-bit/FBO/Fri Oct 12 12:11:32 2007</code> (I need to select data from 2 tables and to execute 2 stored procedures)</li> </ul>  <p>I've installed the ODBC driver and created an ODBC source using <code>c:\Windows\SysWOW64\odbcad32.exe</code>. A connection is successfully established when I test it from ODBC Data Source Administrator. But when I create a linked server I get an error: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>[Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager] The specified DSN contains an architecture mismatch between the Driver and Application".</p> </blockquote>  <p>That's because there is a mismatch between 64-bit SQL Server and 32-bit ODBC driver. And obviously I need some proxy to provide connection between server and driver. I've found a few bridges but all of them are proprietary.</p>  <p>Is there any free proxy solution or a free 64-bit SyBase driver?</p>  <p><strong>UPD</strong></p>  <p>There is still no good production solution, but as proposed Paolo in the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/32778758/5308054">answer</a>, I use a 32-bit SQL Server Express to resolve the issue.</p>  <p>What I've done step by step:</p>  <ol> <li>install a 32-bit SQL Server Express 2014 on the same copmputer (probably it is not the best idea, but it makes possible to use <code>Shared Memory</code> )</li> <li><p>connect the 32-bit SQL Server Express to the Sybase database via ODBC</p></li> <li><p>create stored procedures on Express using the <code>OPENQUERY</code> function to request data from SyBase</p></li> <li><p>connect the 32-bit SQL Server Express 2014 to the 64-bit SQL Sever 2012 as a linked server (address of Express is <code>LOCAL\(SQLEXPRESS)</code>)</p></li> </ol>
