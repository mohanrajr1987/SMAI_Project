<p>Beginner here.</p>  <p>I have an application built in MFC Vicual C++, compiled using VS2010. I have a DSN as an ODBC connection to a live Excel spreadsheet (via Excel driver).</p>  <p>My app queries a spreadsheet every second. If one cell's value changes (a result of a simple calculation involving other cells receiving a live data feed), the app prints the new value then goes back to querying for changes.</p>  <p>The App works fine for a period of time, dutifully printing the changes in the cell's value as new data arrives in the feed. Then, it invariably generates an error:</p>  <p>"The Microsoft Jet Engine could not find the object '(unknown)' Make sure the object exists and that you spell its name and the path name correctly."</p>  <p>The file paths are all given in absolutes.</p>  <p>I surmise that the error is generated whenever the query happens to exactly coincide with the cell's contents being updated. I can generate the exact same error message and behavior, always, instantly, by clicking on the surveyed cell and touching a key (beginning to edit the cell, here by overtyping the cell formula).</p>  <p>An Afx error dialog runs. If I "OK" and select the excel file, the application goes back and runs, until a new same error. But if I select "Cancel" the application exits. </p>  <p>If I comment out my own error catch, this dialog still appears.</p>  <p>I would like the application to run "headless" and merely retry to connect with the database. </p>  <p>Is there any way I can override here?</p>  <p>I realize Excel is not amenable to concurrent (multiuser) access. But I don't need to have concurrent access- I don't care to see the cell when "something else" is changing it. I simply want to (wait and) retry.</p>  <p>Apologies in advance for asking about dinosaur bone-tech here. The fact I need to query live data has led me by trial-and-error to ODBC (libxl sees only the file data and formulas, rather than their values).</p>
