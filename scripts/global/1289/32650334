<p>I'm trying to do a little powerShell script, which establishes a OBDC connection using SQL Server Native Client 11.0 as Driver and retrieve some data which, in my case, is just getting the list to the database tables.</p>  <pre><code>##### Start the database connection and set up environment $DbString="Driver=SQL Server Native Client 11.0;Server=[server_name];Database=[db_name];Uid=[user];Pwd=admin@[pwd];Encrypt=yes;Connection Timeout=30;" $DBConnection=New-Object System.Data.Odbc.OdbcConnection $DBCommand=New-Object System.Data.Odbc.OdbcCommand $DBConnection.ConnectionString=$DbString $DBConnection.Open() $DBCommand.Connection=$DBConnection  $sqlQuery = "show tables;"  $DBCommand.CommandText = $sqlQuery  $DBCommand.ExecuterReader() //Crashes </code></pre>  <p>The problem is when I run it, I get this problem</p>  <pre><code>ERROR [42000] [Microsoft][SQL Server Native Client 11.0][SQL Server] Could not find stored procedure 'show' </code></pre>  <p>It seems like the problem comes from ExecuteReader but I can't find a way out, please help !</p>
