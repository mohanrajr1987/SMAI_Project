<p>I'm having a weird issue when I try to add a new driver to the System DSN for the ODBC Data Source Administrator, I enter in all the necessary information to add an Adaptive Server Enterprise (Data Source Name, Server Name, Server Port, Database name, Logon ID), and Click Ok to Save the Setting. But when I try to pull up the the setting for the Driver by Clicking on the Configure button, only the Data Source Name remain; all other information that I entered are blanked out. This started happen recently and it's a little mind boggling.</p>  <p>I have Windows 7 64 bit</p>
