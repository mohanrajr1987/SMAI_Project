<p>I am working on a classic asp ADODB.RecordSet count is 0 but should be higher (i.e. there should be 1 or more records returned from this query).</p>  <p>How can I tell if the RecordSet successfully opened?  The recordset uses a udl file to connect with the database.  The udl has a "test connection" button, and this button works.</p>  <p>This functionality was working for years, but now has stopped working.  I suspect that the udl connection is bad, but how do I verify that?</p>  <p>CODE: </p>  <pre class="lang-vb prettyprint-override"><code>SET con1=CreateObject("ADODB.Connection") SET rs_a1=CreateObject("ADODB.RecordSet")  con1.CursorLocation = adUseClient con1.Open "File Name=c:\WINNT\UDL_DLLS\f1.udl"  strSQL = "SELECT * FROM Session_MVRecord_Long WHERE Session = '" &amp; strRSSession &amp; "'"  rs_a1.Open strSQL,con1  'Set Filter to ourRecord1 record--  rs_a1.Filter ="ourRecord1Status &lt;&gt; '' OR ourRecord1Yr &lt;&gt; '' OR   ourRecord1Key &lt;&gt; ''"  rs_a1.MoveLast rs_a1.MoveFirst IF rs_a1.RecordCount &lt;= 0 THEN%&gt; 'do stuff </code></pre>
