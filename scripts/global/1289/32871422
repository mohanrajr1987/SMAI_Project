<p>I am making the transition from R to python and from flat files to relational databases, so this is ugly. </p>  <p>After establishing a connection with my database using pyodbc, i use pandas to extract the tables that i need. I know for a fact that the data table that i need have at least 4000 rows but i keep getting only three rows. pretty sure it's an option that im not specifying correctly, it's just not obvious where i am going wrong. </p>  <pre><code>    import pyodbc      import pandas as pd     from pandas import *      cnxn = pyodbc.connect('DSN=mydsn')      hdem = pd.read_sql('select * from mytable', cnxn)     hdem.shape </code></pre>  <p>Where am i going wrong here?  Many thanks in advance. </p>
