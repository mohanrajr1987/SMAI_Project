<p>Working on an Excel VBA project that sends data to an SQL server via ADO. In my office I have no issues but the users are based at locations where they use VSAT connections. Thus, the ping time go for 1-2 ms to 800 ms for lag.</p>  <p>I want to test my code's ADO Connection and Command Timeouts to make sure I have them set appropriately. Anyone have any tried and true code snippets that increase the CommandTimeout and ConnectionTimeout after a failed .open or .execute command?</p>  <p>I have seen via Google Search that many web developers use Fiddler but that looks like it will only work for HTTP-type connections.</p>  <p>Anyone have an idea that doesn't involve me creating my own VPN (I have no server) or re-configuring the SQL server, I'm not the owner.</p>
