<p>I have a domain with 10+ clients. The server was rebooted recently, and upon reboot, two of the clients are receiving an error when attempting to access the SQL Server. The clients are running Win7 64bit with MS Office 2013 32bit. All the other computers have no issue.</p>  <p>The MS Access database uses linked tables to connect to the SQL Server 2008 R2 using Trusted Authentication. When opening the Access database, Access hangs for about 30 seconds before showing this error message:</p>  <p><em>Connection Failed; SQLState: 'S1T00'; SQL Server Error: 0; [Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver]Login Timeout Expired</em></p>  <p>When I click OK to clear the error, the SQL Login prompt appears. The server address is already entered, and we use a Trusted connection. Without changing any of the settings I click OK to the login prompt, and it connects to the database successfully.</p>  <p><strong>Sites discussing the same problem</strong> (but without a solution that has worked for me): <a href="http://www.sqlservercentral.com/Forums/Topic1264891-1550-1.aspx" rel="nofollow">SQLServerCentral</a> -- <a href="http://forums.databasejournal.com/showthread.php?44357-ODBC-connection-Timesout-then-allows-connection" rel="nofollow">Database Journal</a></p>  <p>(I'm limited by reputation and can't post additional links, but I also found a Google Groups post suggesting resetting Winsock.
