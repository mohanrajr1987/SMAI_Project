<p>Facing Tableau Error while trying to use the workbook created in TD8.0 and open in TD 9.0.TD8.0 and 9.0 are installed on the same machine.</p>  <p>"ERROR 2624: Column "" does not exist The table "" does not exist. Unable to connect to the server "". Check that the server is running and that you have access privileges to the requested database."</p>  <p>Currently for TD 9.0 I have HP Vertica DB(Vertica ODBC driver version 7.1) installed.Has this error something to do with version compatibility between Vertica database version and ODBC driver for TD 8.0?</p>
