<p>I have a ms access application that links mysql tables v√≠a ODBC. The mysql db used to be in the same LAN and performance was spot on, but was outsourced to a different location with a 100Mbs connection. Version:</p>  <p><strong>CentOs: 6.7</strong></p>  <p><strong>Mysql: 5.6.26</strong></p>  <p><strong>Ms access: 2010</strong> (Also tested in a ms access 2003 )</p>  <p><strong>ODBC: 5.3 unicode driver version in a windows 7 PC</strong></p>  <p>I have tested both a <strong>myIsam table</strong> and an <strong>InnoDB table</strong> with 3 fields, being the first one an integer type which works as the PK. </p>  <p><strong>test_localTable</strong> is a local table created in ms access with 30 rows</p>  <p>-> Using this commands from an ms access query:</p>  <pre><code>insert into mysqlInnoDb_remoteTable select * from test_localTable  insert into mysqlMyIsam_remoteTable select * from test_localTable  delete * from mysqlInnoDb_remoteTable  delete * from mysqlMyIsam_remoteTable </code></pre>  <p>Both the innodb and the myIsam tables take on average 10 seconds to insert, 11 seconds to delete. Same goes with updates.</p>  <p>The interesting thing is that any kind of select query runs as fast as if I were working with the server locally.</p>  <p>I assume my server is missing some vital tweaking as I don't consider that performance acceptable.</p>  <p>Could you help me out?</p>  <p>thank you</p>
