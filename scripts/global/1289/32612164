<p>This error comes up when I try and run this big query. Smaller query's it doesn't. I have set connect timeout to 0 and that doesn't help. It looks like the connect makes it and it gets hung up at the .Open part of the code. Thank you for any help.</p>  <pre><code>Public Sub dbConnectTDaY()     Dim cn As ADODB.Connection     Dim Rec_set As ADODB.Recordset     Dim MyConn, varSQL As String     Dim Rw As Long, Col As Long, c As Long     Dim MyField, Location As Range     Dim i As Integer      Dim strSQL As String     Dim strStDt As String     Dim strEnDt As String     strStDt = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets("xxx").Range("B6").Value     strEnDt = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets("xxx").Range("B5").Value     Set cn = New ADODB.Connection     Set Rec_set = New ADODB.Recordset     Set Location = [A2]         Rw = Location.Row         Col = Location.Column         c = Col      strSQL = ""     strSQL = strSQL &amp; "SELECT gp.cnt"     strSQL = strSQL &amp; ",gp.pod"     strSQL = strSQL &amp; ",gp.grp_paddsa"     strSQL = strSQL &amp; ",gp.grp_rasdd"    '  etc.........        cn.ConnectionTimeout = 0 'To wait till the query finishes without generating error      cn.Open "DSN=#EDWP;Databasename=INTY;Uid=XXXXX;Pwd=XXXXX;"       If cn.State = adStateOpen Then 'If connection is success, continue 'Check for errors...
