<p>I'm having trouble installing pyodbc on El Capitan. I have another virtualenv which was created during Yosemite days that has pyodbc.</p>  <p>I am installing pyodbc through the following command:</p>  <pre><code>pip install --global-option=build_ext --global-option="-I/usr/local/include" --allow-external pyodbc --allow-unverified pyodbc pyodbc </code></pre>  <p>It errs out saying it cannot find odbc dynamic library.</p>  <p>ld: library not found for -lodbc</p>  <p>The version of python I'm using is python 2.7.10(but has similar problems installing in python 2.6.9 too)</p>
