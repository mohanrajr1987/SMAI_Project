<p>I am working for a company who bought DBA Manufacturing and I need to retrieve some values from the Pervasive SQL 2000i DB. Unfortunately there are no plans to upgrade the DB so I have to make due with what I have. I am running a 32 bit </p>  <p>I was able to make an <code>odbc_connect</code> call in PHP to the DSN on a windows machine. I am running PHP on Windows with NGINX. </p>  <pre><code>&lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt;     Placeholder Title &lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt;     &lt;body&gt;  &lt;?php  // mb_internal_encoding("UTF-8");  // connect to the dbamfg DSN $connect=odbc_connect("Driver={Pervasive ODBC Client Interface};ServerName=dbamfg.1583;ServerDSN=dbadefault;","","");   // query the users table for name and surname $query = "select * from BKARINVL where BKAR_INVL_INVNM = 600100 order by bkar_invl_cntr ";  //Prepare the statement $result = odbc_prepare ($connect, $query); // execute the query odbc_execute($result);  // fetch the data from the database while(odbc_fetch_row($result)){    $SalesOrder = odbc_result($result, 1);   $InvLine = odbc_result($result, 2);   $EstShpDt = odbc_result($result, 3);   $ProdCode = odbc_result($result, 4);   $ProdDesc = odbc_result($result, 5);    echo ('&lt;br /&gt;'.$InvLine.'&lt;br /&gt;');    echo ($SalesOrder.'&lt;br /&gt;');    echo ($EstShpDt.'&lt;br /&gt;');    echo ($ProdCode.'&lt;br /&gt;');    echo ($ProdDesc.'&lt;br /&gt;');   }  // closing the connection odbc_close($connect); ?&gt;  &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; </code></pre>  <p>The query returns numeric values just fine. When it comes to text columns it returns 10 characters and after that it shows characters that are not displaying correctly.</p>  <p>here is an example:</p>  <pre><code>1 600100 2015-05-31 020-0015-1 DIGITAL VI!2S��  2 600100 2015-05-31 020-0012-0 2 X 4 AUDI!5S��  3 600100 2015-05-31 020-0065-0 16-CKT LOW!8S�� </code></pre>  <p>I'm excited and shocked that I have gotten this far! It's exceptionally fast to retrieve values from Pervasive through the ODBC connection and I feel like I am very close to being successful. I just need a push in the right direction. </p>  <p>Everything I have tried so far: I have tried to set the internal encoding of the page to several different character sets including UTF-8, Windows, ASCII, etc. I have also tried to select the checkbox under the ODBC driver setup options during DSN setup in Windows, which says "Use OEM/ANSI Conversion". This does nothing but change the characters by a bit.</p>  <p>Another clue to this is that for some reason when I call the connection string using <code>System.Data.odbc</code> in C# it returns the query and text values in full. </p>  <p>I have tried using <code>iconv</code> to convert the values to UTF-8, etc., to no avail. I've tried forcing the header to display the page in different character sets. I have tried <code>mb_detect_encoding()</code> on the <code>odbc_result()</code> and the return value says UTF-8, but I assume it has to do  There must be someone out there that knows how to fix this. Please, would anyone point me in the right direction? I will be forever grateful!</p>  <p>If anything more needs to be added to solve this I will include it when requested. Thank you!</p>
