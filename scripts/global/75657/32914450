<p>I'm using Ember data JSON API Adapter, in development against the Mocks server provided with Express.</p>  <p>When I switched from RESTAdapter to JSONAPIAdapter, I could no longer access the body of the request.</p>  <p>Can I easily make the mocks respond to the Content-Type: application/vnd.json+api and understand the req.body as JSON?</p>  <p>I have gotten around this for now by adding  Content-Type:application/json  to my app/adapters/application.js file.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>  <pre><code>DEBUG: ------------------------------- DEBUG: Ember      : 1.13.7 DEBUG: Ember Data : 1.13.8 DEBUG: jQuery     : 1.11.3 DEBUG: ------------------------------- </code></pre>
