<p>I have a list of components (all the same)</p>  <pre><code>&lt;ul class="search-results"&gt;   {{#each res as |item|}}     {{search-result item=item}}   {{/each}} &lt;/ul&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I'd like to add a class on the clicked element, and, when a new element is clicked, the old element should become "unclicked" (aka, remove the class).</p>  <p>Which is the best way to obtain this result?</p>
