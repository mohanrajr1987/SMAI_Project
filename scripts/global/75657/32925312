<p>I'm just starting out with ember JS and my basic application seemed to be working like a charm, till I decided to add ember-cli-simple-auth through the ember cli. Since I have added this, I'm getting the error in the title and I have no clue how.  I know there is not much detail I have provided, but this is all I can think of. I tried uninstalling the ember-cli-simple-auth library but it doesn't help. Any help here would be really appreciated.</p>
