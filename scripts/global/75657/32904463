<p>I am trying run webpack HMR with ember app. I haven not found any ember specific hot loader for ember yet. Never mind, my problem is that only css changes are hot loaded without refresh.  When I change java file, I can see in a console this:</p>  <p><code>[WDS] App updated. Recompiling...</code></p>  <p><code>[WDS] App hot update...</code></p>  <p><code>[HMR] Checking for updates on the server...</code></p>  <p><code>[HMR] Updated modules:</code></p>  <p><code>[HMR]  - 541</code></p>  <p><code>[HMR] App is up to date.</code></p>  <p>... so it seems HMR is working. Also I am able to find an updated module source code in console management but the changes are not visible on the web page I cant found out why.</p>  <p>Maybe it is because module is physically updated in a browser memory, but not in ember environment.</p>  <p>Any ideas how to make it work? Thanks.</p>
