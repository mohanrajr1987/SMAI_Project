<p>in my Ember.js application I have models: item, module, rank with following structure: item hasMany modules, each module can have a rank and rank has property score.</p>  <p>Item is my model for controller. I want to show sums of all scores from all modules. So I want to create computed property, however I have no idea how to write the dependency in <code>.property("name_of_property")</code>. Could you help me?</p>
