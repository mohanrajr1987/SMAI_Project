<p>I have built a basic CRM app to learn Ember. The app uses a Rails back end; and Ember and Rails communicate with a JSON api. Feel free to check out the <a href="https://github.com/adam-wanninger/ember-crm-js" rel="nofollow">source code on my GitHub</a>. The app is hosted <a href="https://ember-rails-crm.herokuapp.com/" rel="nofollow">here.</a></p>  <p>The app works great in my development environment, and deploys to Heroku with no issues whatsoever. </p>  <p>However, when I navigate to the apps URL I see a blank page. Further inspection using Chrome's dev tools tells me that none of my javascript files were sent from Heroku to my browser. What gives?</p>
