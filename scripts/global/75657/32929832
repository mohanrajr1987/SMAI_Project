<p>i want use the primaryKey as _id, and not id, and i already try everything, but this error keeps poping up in the console:</p>  <pre><code>You must include an 'id' for event in an object passed to 'push' </code></pre>  <p>I already search a lot and i can't figure it out whats the problem,  i am using the RESTSerializer to fix the problem:</p>  <pre><code>'use strict' SiteApp.ApplicationSerializer = DS.RESTSerializer.extend({   primaryKey: '_id' }); </code></pre>  <p>What could be the problem here??</p>
