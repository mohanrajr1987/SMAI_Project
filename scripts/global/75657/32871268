<p>I have  a queryParam in my controller that is an array like so: </p>  <pre><code>export default Ember.Controller.extend({   queryParams: ['customFilters'],   customFilters: []      // Other code goes here } </code></pre>  <p>Now I want to link to this controller and provide one or many values to the customFilters queryParam as an array like so: </p>  <pre><code>{{#link-to 'search' (query-params customFilters=['selection1'])}}   Custom Selection {{/link-to}} </code></pre>  <p>Unfortunately the link-to helper doesn't seem to allow me to do that and just gives me a link to the search route with no query parameters. So I have two questions.</p>  <p>1) Is this something that I should be able to do? </p>  <p>2) Can I use the link-to helper to generate the link for me or should I try and hand roll it?</p>
