<p>I am trying to create a web server(REST APIs), which should be able to store, organise and stream videos for a client request.</p>  <p>My confusion:</p>  <ul> <li>How should a user can upload videos. From research, I decided that I would store all the metadata for the videos in database(google datastore), and all the video files in separate storage(Google cloud storage). Now, to upload videos, what is the proper way?</li> <li>Once a video is uploaded and stored, how will the streaming will happen. Suppose a user make a request to watch a video, server will get a http request for that. But how to stream videos? Is there any service for this? Because using http streaming directly in code affects performance I guess.</li> </ul>  <p>From my understanding, I want to use a service which should be able to stream videos from my storage to a client upon the server's request. I guessed the server should make request to this "video streaming service" only after verifying the user credentials.</p>
