<p>I am using BBB 0.8 in one of our project.As per requirement we want to record a session (contains chat,audio,desk-share,webcam). And as per BBB 0.8 documentation we made some changes to achieve this. (please find below steps and confirm for the same)</p>  <p>1: edit /usr/share/red5/webapps/video/WEB-INF/red5-web.xml and set recordVideoStream to true. 2: edit /usr/share/red5/webapps/deskshare/WEB-INF/red5-web.xml and at line 41 set the value for constructor-arg to true. 3: while creating a new meeting pass record=true</p>  <p>(<a href="https://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/wiki/MatterhornIntegration#Install_Ingest_and_Processing_package_for_Matterhorn" rel="nofollow">https://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/wiki/MatterhornIntegration#Install_Ingest_and_Processing_package_for_Matterhorn</a>)</p>  <p>After this change we restarted the server and tested , the recorded contents are correctly storing in corresponding paths (including .flv for video)</p>  <p>But when we run default playback.html file its showing only chat,audio,presentation but not able to see the recorded video.</p>  <p>Q1.
