<p>I've grabbed an Image from the video capture card with opencv. I want to process each frame and send it back as a video stream. so, to do this I've written that video to a location using videowriter class in opencv and I've tried to stream that video using ffmpeg but the output isn't satisfactory(gives stuttering effect), I've used mjpeg stream method to stream the video but that was a failure too.</p>
