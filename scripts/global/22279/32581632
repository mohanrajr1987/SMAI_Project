<p>It has been stated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_video_container_formats" rel="nofollow">here</a> that it is possible to encapsulate H.264/AVC in OGG video container format. I previously asked a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32559491/encapsulating-h-264-in-mp4">similar question about MP4</a> and realized the answer. Do you know any specification for storing/streaming H.264 inside an Ogg container? Does OGG have a specific payload format for H.264?</p>
