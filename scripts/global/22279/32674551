<p>I need to create an implementation that decrypt video files. I'm currently using the AesBase64 algorithm to decrypt these videos, but in my tests decryption became too heavy for Android because the byte array and released completely in memory, with so I'm getting java.lang.OutOfMemoryError when the fileIt has more than 25 MB. My question is: How can I implement a buffer for me to decrypt each byte array and already play the video for each decrypted byte?</p>
