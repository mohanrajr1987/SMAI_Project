<p>I have a video streaming of a security webcam. I'd need to take screenshots at a as high as possible resolution at regular intervals. </p>  <p>Option 1 would be to fullscreen the video and take regular screenshots and save them but I'd have the computer busy and couldnt work on it anymore.</p>  <p>Option 2 would be to somehow capture the webstream, and extract a screenshot from the stream.</p>  <p>Are there any better otpions? How could i capture screenshots from the stream?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
