<p>How to <strong>store a large amount of videos online</strong> and enable users to <strong>stream</strong> them, so how can i <strong>use cloud services</strong> to do so. </p>  <p>The website admin will upload many videos per month and users will be able to stream and watch them, so i'm expecting a quite good/heavy traffic, you can say it will be like Vimeo or YouTube but smaller scale of course.</p>  <p>So the requirement:</p>  <ul> <li><p>Store as many video file as i want.</p></li> <li><p>Users can stream without bandwidth/traffic limitation (buying service is okay)</p></li> <li><p>Full control of the uploaded storage (edit &amp; delete).</p></li> <li><p>Web statistics (streaming, visitors, etc.)</p></li> </ul>
