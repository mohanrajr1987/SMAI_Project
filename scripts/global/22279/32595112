<p><br>Firstly, I'm not sure if the title is clear enough. I just try to explain what happens to me and what I'm trying to do. <br> I'm trying to detect the direct link of media files (films, videos, etc...) from some website by using 'Firebug' (Firefox), 'Inspector' (Firefox) or other tools in Chrome. I also tried with Wireshark. It's pretty easy for some website because I can see the direct link from the request and by using programs like Quicktime, I can save the file to my local disk. For some other websites, I can see requests for streaming media content. However, the problem is that for the same file, there are many requests. It seems that after each several seconds, they use a different request to load, say 1.5Mb. When I copy one detected link to the address bar, the browser downloads a small file (media type), but the file cannot be played. Following is one example for using multiple requests for a same video:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/7Ay6N.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/7Ay6N.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>My questions are: <br>- How can they decompose the video content into multiple requests? How can they accumulate the responses? What kind of Protocol used? (From Wireshark, it's TCP stream, but I'm not sure if it correct because I read somewhere that rtmp is common). I watched a video on YouTube about 'rtmpdump' but it isn't applicable in this case (in the attached image) <br>- Is there any client tool that can help us to accumulate multiple media responses? <br>Thank you very much.</p>
