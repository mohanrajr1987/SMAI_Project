<p>Is there anyway that i can play video from the cloud recognition of the target rather than preloading video and it's trackable image in the device database. I am aware that we can change set the mediaplayer data source to a url but in that case also the trackable remains the same.<br> Any help in this would be much appreciated.</p>
