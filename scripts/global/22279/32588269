<p>I have a web page which has a video tag. I want to write a server in python such that it streams the video to the browser. Can any one help me do it. I do not want my entire video file to be sent to the client rather than it should work like file is sent in chunks.</p>  <p>I Came to know about http-range header but just want to know that how youtube videos are delivered on to the youtube site. Are they delivered in chunks and how does that chunk size is decided?</p>
