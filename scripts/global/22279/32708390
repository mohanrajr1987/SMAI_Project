<p>I'm trying to use Azure Media Services. For demo purpose I've uploaded a video directly on the portal then clicked to encode this uploaded video in 'H264 Smooth Streaming 720p' preset.<br> This scheduled a encoding job which generated another (off-course larger) file which I published to get the manifest file URL.</p>  <p>I can play this video on the portal itself but when I use the <a href="http://mspocforknorish.streaming.mediaservices.windows.net/72496130-cb2d-455e-9ccd-420fcb506f1d/BigBuckBunny.ism/Manifest" rel="nofollow">given URL</a> I get the following error:    </p>  <blockquote>   <p>A network error caused the video download to fail part-way. Please check your network connection or try again later. (0x20200000)</p> </blockquote>  <p>I'm taking help from <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/blogs/DaveVoyles/Encoding-video-with-Azure-Media-Services" rel="nofollow">this Channel9 video</a>.</p>  <p>Please help me on this.</p>
