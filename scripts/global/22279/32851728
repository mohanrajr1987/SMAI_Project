<p>I want to create vod streaming. I want to stream video through hls and mpeg-dash.<br> I am using H.264 / AAC. But I don't want to store video twice in both hls and mpeg-dash containers. Is it possible to store video in temporary containers (like mpeg-ts or mp4) and then use hls and mpeg-dash for streaming vod? Or is it possible to store video h.264 and audio aac separately and then pack video on the fly in hls or mpeg-dash?<br> I won't use live streaming.</p>
