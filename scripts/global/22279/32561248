<p>I'm trying to play video files on iOS from CC3200 using Socket communication. (CC3200 is simple wifi device. So I read the video file on SD card using CC3200) In my case, the CC3200  is not able to add the Video Codec feature. So I sent directly the video files as a data to iOS without any codec. Therefore, in iOS, I can get only file data from CC3200. Of course, when I received all file data from CC3200, I can play the video on iOS. But I'd like to play the video file like streaming while the file is receiving from CC3200. So I tried to find the way on internet, but I can't find any way at all. Is it possible to implement my idea? Or is there another way to do so? Thank you for your attention.</p>
