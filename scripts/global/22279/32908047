<p>I have a GStreamer pipeline to play live video from RTSP source. I want the user to be able to increase / decrease the delay. My approach to this is to have a <code>queue</code> element and manipulate its <code>min-threshold-time</code> parameter.</p>  <p>This seems to work at start. On for instance 10 seconds delay, The pipeline starts frozen, and continues after 10 seconds. But if I manipulate the time, nothing happens. I have tried other parameters as well, like <code>max-size-time</code>, without luck. <code>leaky</code> parameter causes the video to be jerky and bad quality.</p>  <p>Currently I am stopping and re-starting the pipeline, which looks terrible.</p>  <p>Pipeline I am using:</p>  <pre><code>gst-launch-1.0 rtspsrc location=&lt;...&gt; ! rtph264depay ! h264parse ! capsfilter caps=video/x-h264 ! avdec_h264 ! videoconvert ! queue min-threshold-delay=&lt;delay&gt; ! autovideosink </code></pre>  <p>Is there a command to force queue to flush the frames, some other element better suitable, or some other trick to accomplish this?</p>
