<p>I need to stream online in real time the video captured from my domestic webcam<br> making it appearing in a webpage accessible from anywhere,<br> so I can watch it from a browser by entering something like <code>http://example.com/webcamStream</code></p>  <p>I readed some stuff about websockets and webRTC, and seems that in my case the best option could be webRTC</p>  <p>I already installed a webserver (apache) and set my domestic router that now redirects external requests to the apache server</p>  <p>I installed node.js, node_modules socket.io, express, ws</p>  <p>I did some little tests following some tutorials like <a href="http://www.programwitherik.com/socket-io-tutorial-with-node-js-and-express" rel="nofollow">this one</a> (that creates a little websocket chat)</p>  <p>and <a href="https://shanetully.com/2014/09/a-dead-simple-webrtc-example/" rel="nofollow">this one</a> that creates a video stream using webRTC</p>  <p>in the second example I was able to start the video stream but I am still confused about how to make that stream accessible from thw web, it is still not definitely clear to me as I am not very experienced with these kind of things</p>  <p>I hope someone can help me to understand what I need in order to accomplish that webcam stream from my house, any help will be really appreciated :)</p>
