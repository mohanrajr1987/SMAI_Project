<p>I am curious to know whether it is possible or good idea to build such a system using SPE. In our lab we developed <strong>Hadoop</strong> based transcoding and streaming service on a cluster of 20 nodes using <code>mkvtoolnix</code> and <code>Xuggler</code> libraries for transcoding. And it works pretty well. However, I am not quite familiar with Storm's usage in Multimedia Manipulation like transcoding. I just know that <strong>Storm</strong> is heavily used in Real-time Big Data Analytics.  My system is intended to process (transcode from various video formats into mpeg4) real-time video data coming from video sensors and at the same time it should be able to stream the transcoded chunks of video to the dashboard.</p>  <p>How can I achieve this using Storm, or any suggestions how to build such a system is very welcome!</p>
