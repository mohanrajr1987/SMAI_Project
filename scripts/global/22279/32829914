<p>Now I want to create a webservice <a href="http://bongacams.com" rel="nofollow">bongacams.com</a> (but without porno). And I have two streaming video servers for choice. kurento and wowza.( I know that kurento uses peer to peer connection) but what are the pros and cons here?Which will suit me better.</p>
