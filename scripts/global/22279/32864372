<p>when I watched videos on my mobile phone I never noticed any image artefacts. Most of the time I was connected to a Wi-Fi and the streaming protocol was HLS. On error the video just stopped, crashed or showed me a load indicator. </p>  <p>Thatâ€™s why I would ask on which faults you can see image artefacts? If the streaming protocol or the device detect image artefacts in error cases? And which image artefacts you guys has seen.</p>  <p>Thanks! </p>
