<p>I hav a Zavio P6210 IP camera (<a href="http://www.zavio.com/product.php?id=85" rel="nofollow">http://www.zavio.com/product.php?id=85</a>) which supports RTSP. My settings on the camera are : (profile1)</p>  <ul> <li>encoding : MJPEG</li> <li>resolution : 640 x 1180</li> <li>Maximum fps : 30</li> <li>quality : standard</li> </ul>  <p>Authentication is disabled on my camera.  In /etc/motion/motion.conf I've set the netcam_url to rtsp://192.168.1.52:554/video.pro1</p>  <p>When I pass this URL into VLC Media Player, the stream works fine.  However, when I start motion, I always get this error messages : </p>  <pre><code>[0] Processing thread 0 - config file /etc/motion/motion.conf [0] Motion 3.2.12 Started [0] ffmpeg LIBAVCODEC_BUILD 3482368 LIBAVFORMAT_BUILD 3478785 [0] Thread 1 is from /etc/motion/motion.conf [1] Thread 1 started [0] motion-httpd/3.2.12 running, accepting connections [0] motion-httpd: waiting for data on port TCP 8080 [1] Invalid netcam_url (rtsp://192.168.1.52:554/video.pro1) [1] Could not fetch initial image from camera [1] Motion continues using width and height from config file(s) [1] Resizing pre_capture buffer to 1 items [1] Started stream webcam server in port 8081 [1] Retrying until successful connection with camera [1] Invalid netcam_url (rtsp://192.168.1.52:554/video.pro1) [1] Retrying until successful connection with camera [1] Invalid netcam_url (rtsp://192.168.1.52:554/video.pro1) </code></pre>  <p>I don't have a clue how to fix this error. Does Motion 3.2.12 not support RTSP MJPEG or am J making a mistake somewhere ?</p>  <p>Any help will be much appreciated.</p>
