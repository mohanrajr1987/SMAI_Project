<p>The definition of <code>Substring()</code> method in .net <code>System.String</code> class is like this</p>  <pre><code>public string Substring(int startIndex) </code></pre>  <p>Where <code>startIndex</code> is <em>"The zero-based starting character position of a substring in this instance"</em> as per the method definition. If i understand it correctly, it means it will give me a part of the string, starting at the given zero-based index.</p>  <p>Now, if I have a string <code>"ABC"</code> and take substring with different indexes, I get following results.</p>  <pre><code>var str = "ABC"; var chars = str.ToArray(); //returns 3 char 'A', 'B', 'C' as expected  var sub2 = str.Substring(2); //[1] returns "C" as expected var sub3 = str.Substring(3); //[2] returns "" ...!!! Why no exception?? var sub4 = str.Substring(4); //[3] throws ArgumentOutOfRangeException as expected </code></pre>  <p>Why it doesn't throw exception for case [2] ?? </p>  <p>The string has 3 characters, so indexes are <code>[0, 1, 2]</code>, and even <code>ToArray()</code>, <code>ToCharArray()</code> method returns 3 characters as expected! Shouldn't it throw exception if I try to <code>Substring()</code> with starting index <code>3</code>?</p>
