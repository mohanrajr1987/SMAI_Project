<p>I have list down items from a database field inside a combo box. The items in the field is something like this</p>  <pre><code>BC9876 BC7654 </code></pre>  <p>I need the output in the combo box to be numeric only. Meaning my output should be like this</p>  <pre><code>9876 7654 </code></pre>  <p>I cannot modify the data inside the database. I am lost. Do you guys have any idea on how to do this? Thank you in advance.</p>
