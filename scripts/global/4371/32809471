<p>I'm attempting to create a simple postcode search. I have been able to affect a change when the input value contains only the first two letter of each postcode, as defined in the variables.</p>  <pre><code>var AB = "AB"; var AL = "AL"; </code></pre>  <p>However when a full postcode is entered, containing extra characters than the defined variables, no change is made. How do I need to structure the variables so they look for an input value that only contains the defined characters.</p>  <p><a href="https://jsfiddle.net/garyvoss/vrL2roas/" rel="nofollow">JSFiddle of what I have so far</a></p>
