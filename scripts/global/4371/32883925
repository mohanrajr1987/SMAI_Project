<p>I have to ask your help with SQL query for Informix and would really appreciate any comments.</p>  <p>Data for contno field (varchar) looks as follows:</p>  <pre><code>C4698   B0458   F400221   D3776   A0636   D3787   B7781   D13799   BXXXXX </code></pre>  <p>I need to find Maximum value of a number that follows letter in the contno string so tried that:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT Max(to_number(contno[2,6])) FROM informix.customer WHERE contno[1,1] = "B" </code></pre>  <p>...but getting  </p>  <pre><code>Error: A character to numeric conversion process failed (State:37000, Native Code: FFFFFB43) </code></pre>  <p>Also excluding 'BXXXX' values doesn't seem to work. Ahh and tried SUBSTRING function too with the same results.</p>  <p>When skipping max function and running this:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT to_number(contno[2,6]) FROM informix.customer WHERE contno[1,1] = "B" </code></pre>  <p>...I get nice list looking like that:</p>  <pre><code>4698.0   458.0   400221.0   3776.0   0636.0   3787.0   7781.0   13799.0 </code></pre>  <p>... but when trying to ORDER BY getting the same error.</p>  <p>Any idea how to solve my problem?</p>
