<p>I have a textbox that gives out suggestions based on user input and one of my textboxes is location based.</p>  <p>The problem is, if a user types in <strong>Chicago,IL</strong>, everything works, but if they type in <strong>Chicago, IL</strong>, the suggestions stop. The only difference between the two is the space after the comma.</p>  <p>How can I fix this, so that even if a user puts in 2 or 4 spaces after the comma it still shows the same results as the first case?</p>  <p>This is my code:</p>  <pre><code>if (location.contains(",")) { // the city works correctly    String city = location.substring(0, location.indexOf(","));     // state is the problem if the user puts any space after the comma    // it throws everything off        String state = location.substring(location.indexOf(",") + 1);     String myquery = "select * from zips where city ilike ? and state ilike ?";    } </code></pre>  <p>I have also tried this:</p>  <pre><code> String state = location.substring(location.indexOf(",".trim()) + 1); </code></pre>  <p>The string variables are used to make calls to the database; that is why I have to eliminate any spaces.</p>
