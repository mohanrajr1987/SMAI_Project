<p>I have a set of characters like </p>  <pre><code>data &lt;- c("ABS Spring Meeting 5.14.15", "DEFG Sellors Tour 10.28.14", "DDCC Fun at the Museum 4.4.15", "GAME CS vs. Washington 11.01.14", "BSS Studio 54 5.13.15","Pas-12 3.5.15") </code></pre>  <p>As you can notice, the last set of digit is date of event. I want to convert them into date</p>  <pre><code>date &lt;- c("2015-05-14","2014-10-28","2015-04-04","2014-11-01","2015-05-13","2015-03-05") </code></pre>  <p>Feel like I have to substring this kind ("5.14.15", "10.28.14", "4.4.15", "11.01.14", "5.13.15", "3.5.15") of pattern, then do the date convert.</p>  <p>Can anyone help me with this? Thank you!</p>
