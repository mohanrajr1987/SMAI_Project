<p>I have a file with outputs like so,</p>  <pre><code>Joel[12813/76561198008530803] was taken by Huey[3924/252820590256923] </code></pre>  <p>I have set up a <code>getline</code> that will scan for the word taken and store it into a string, I tried using <code>substr</code> but I'm having an issue. The issue is that the numbers between the brackets can be different sizes so when I try something along the lines of <code>find_first_of("/");</code> in combination with <code>substr</code>, I can't use the second parameter or it might cut off numbers. I get everything past the first forward slash.</p>  <p>What I want in the end is to extract just this portion <code>76561198008530803</code> of the string.</p>  <p>What I tried, </p>  <pre><code>while (getline(read, line)) {     if (line.find("taken") != string::npos) {         size_t pos = line.find_first_of("/");         extension = line.substr(pos + 1);         output &lt;&lt; extension &lt;&lt; endl;     } </code></pre>  <p>Thanks for taking the time!</p>
