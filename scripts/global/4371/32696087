<p>Say I have this string </p>  <pre><code>[0] playerName19  [1] playerName17  [2] playerName18  [3] playerName15  [4]      playerName59  [5] playerName16  [6] playerName6  [7] playerName60 </code></pre>  <p>How do I split it into something like this, using Java: </p>  <pre><code>[0] playerName19, [1] playerName17, [2] playerName18...  </code></pre>  <p>I tried using split() but the problem is that the playerName number extension is randomly generated and changes for each query. </p>
