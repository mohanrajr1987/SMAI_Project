<p>I want to do something like that:</p>  <pre><code>declare @manufacture varchar(MAX) declare @model varchar(MAX) declare @version varchar(MAX) declare @fipeId varchar(MAX) set @manufacture = (select top 1 MarcaFipe from fipeNew where ModeloFipe like 'Palio%' group by MarcaFipe) set @model = (select ModeloFipe replace(fipeNew.ModeloFipe, '%', 'Palio') from fipeNew where ModeloFipe like 'Palio%') set @version = (replace(fipeNew.ModeloFipe, 'Palio ', '') from fipeNew where ModeloFipe like 'Palio%') set @fipeId = (select CodigoFipe from fipeNew where ModeloFipe like 'Palio%')  UPDATE vehicle SET vehicle.manufacture=@manufacture, vehicle.model=@model, vehicle.version=@version, vehicle.fipeId=@fipeID </code></pre>  <p>In short, I have the following table:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/pUnqj5s.png" rel="nofollow">http://i.imgur.com/pUnqj5s.png</a></p>  <p>Note: Couldn't post image because of my reputation.</p>  <p>I want to split the dbo.newFipe.ModeloFipe that has string like 'Palio%' and MarcaFipe='Fiat' and set the first word (Palio in this case) into dbo.vehicle.model and the rest of the substring into dbo.vehicle.version.</p>  <p>How can I do this?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
