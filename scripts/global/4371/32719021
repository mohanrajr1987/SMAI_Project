<p>I have a DataFile, built by subsidiairy Application. I need to locate some substring contained in the data file. They are identifiable by the character symbols delimiting them. For instance : *!<code>substring</code>qSxt .The substring will vary from a project to another so I need to locate the symbols delimiting them to read the following substring. I also printed the file to different encodings trying which one was used and matched the original data file. found it was <code>MacOsRomanStringEncoding</code>.</p>  <p>I use <code>NSRange:rangOfString</code>to locate the delimiting symbols. Here is my code : </p>  <pre><code>char *debutAudio ="jjbj"; char *finAudio ="qSxt";  NSString *debutAudioConverted = [[NSString alloc]                                  initWithCString: debutAudio                                  encoding:NSMacOSRomanStringEncoding]; NSString *finAudioConverted = [[NSString alloc]                                initWithCString: finAudio                                encoding:NSMacOSRomanStringEncoding];   NSRange debutaudioRange =[dataFileContent rangeOfString:debutAudioConverted]; NSRange finaudioRange =[dataFileContent rangeOfString:finAudioConverted];   NSLog(@"range is %@",NSStringFromRange(debutaudioRange)); NSLog(@"range is %@",NSStringFromRange(finaudioRange)); </code></pre>  <p>Both <code>NSLog</code> returns range is {9223372036854775807, 0} so not locating the delimiting strings there.</p>  <p>And if I ask to look for other strings contained in the file like "Settings" the <code>rangeOfString</code> will return the proper location and length.</p>  <p>I thought the file may contain multiple encodings, and tried converting with <code>initWithCString</code>to any possible encoding but nothing would do.</p>  <p>Also if I open the file in text edit and use the "Find" function, it will not locate the delimiting string, but will locate other words. My guts tell me its related. I dont know where to look for info. Could the file be protected, I am reading a copy of it though.</p>
