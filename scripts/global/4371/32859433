<p>I'm having a problem with substrings, I have a string in the format below I'm  currently using getline.</p>  <pre><code>Richard[12345/678910111213141516] was murdered </code></pre>  <p>What I have been using is <code>find_last_of</code> and <code>find_first_of</code> to get the positions in between the brackets and forward slashes to retrieve each field. I have this working and functional but I have ran into a problem. The name field can be 32 characters in length, and can contain / and [] so when I finally ran into a user with a URL for his name it did not like that. The numbers are also random on a per user basis. I'm retrieving each field from the string, the name and the two identifying numbers. </p>  <p>Another string can look like this, so I would be grabbing 6 total substrings.</p>  <pre><code>Richard[12345/678910111213141516] was murdered by Ralph[54321/161514131211109876] </code></pre>  <p>Which is just a just another huge mess, what I was thinking about doing was starting from the back and moving to the front, but if the second name field (Ralph) contains any / or [] its going to ruin the count for retrieving the first part. Any insight would be helpful. Thank you.</p>  <p>In a nutshell. how do I account for these. </p>  <p>Names can also contain any alpha / numerical and special character.</p>  <pre><code>Richard///[][][12345/678910111213141516] was murdered by Ralph[/[54321/161514131211109876] </code></pre>  <p>The end result would be 6 substrings containing this. </p>  <ul> <li>Richard///[][]</li> <li>12345</li> <li>678910111213141516</li> <li>Ralph[/</li> <li>54321</li> <li>161514131211109876</li> </ul>  <p>Regex has been mentioned to me, but I don't know if it would be better suited for the task or not, I included the tag so someone more experienced with it might answer/comment.</p>
