<p>I'm having a bit of problems getting a piece of a string.</p>  <p>The string I have looks something like this.</p>  <p><code>50.184.xxx.xx:52240/7656119xxxxxxxxxx/John joined [windows/7656119xxxxxxxxxx]</code></p>  <p>Where x's can be different lengths, also John could be different name.</p>  <p>I have extracted the numbers from this string using find_first_of and find_last_of combinations by getting the "[" and "/" but I cannot figure out how to extract John. Any help would be greatly appreciated. </p>
