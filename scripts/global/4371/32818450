<p>I am looking into the Regex function in Python.  As part of this, I am trying to extract a substring from a string. </p>  <p>For instance, assume I have the string: </p>  <pre><code>&lt;place of birth="Stockholm"&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Is there a way to extract Stockholm with a <strong>single</strong> regex call? </p>  <p>So far, I have: </p>  <pre><code>location_info = "&lt;place of birth="Stockholm"&gt;"  #Remove before location_name1 = re.sub(r"&lt;place of birth=\"", r"", location_info) #location_name1 --&gt; Stockholm"&gt;  #Remove after location_name2 = re.sub(r"\"&gt;", r"", location_name1) #location_name2 --&gt; Stockholm </code></pre>  <p>Any advice on how to extract the string Stockholm, without using two "re.sub" calls is highly appreciated. </p>
