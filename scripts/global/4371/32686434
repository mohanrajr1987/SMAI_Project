<p>I'm new on linux and learning its commands, I tried to search first this problem but other solutions are specific to their problems and doesn't match on mine, here's my problem:</p>  <p>$1 is a file that contains words i need to find in $2. $2 is a directory</p>  <p>e.g.</p>  <p>$1 = <code>/home/fedora/my_folder/words.txt</code></p>  <p>inside of $1:</p>  <pre><code>apple ball cat dog  earthworm </code></pre>  <p>$2 = <code>/home/fedora/myfolder/files/</code></p>  <p>inside of $2:</p>  <pre><code>myFile.txt myFile2.txt myFile3.txt etc... </code></pre>  <p>I use <code>grep -in -R -f $1 $2 &gt; /directory/file.txt</code></p>  <p>its output is something like this:</p>  <p><code>/home/fedora/my_folder/myFile.txt:2:2015-01-01 is good</code></p>  <p>it works just fine on its purpose, but I wanted to get only output like this:</p>  <pre><code>/home/fedora/my_folder/myFile.txt:2:apple 2015-01-01 </code></pre>  <p>e.g.  <strong>line that matched: 2015-01-01 apple is good.</strong></p>  <p>result: <code>/home/fedora/my_folder/myFile.txt:2:apple 2015-01-01</code></p>  <p>to be exact i just only need to output the file name with the word i searched which i think can be done with -o, but i can't seem to substring or get the date along with the file name and word i matched only.</p>  <p>thanks in advance.</p>
