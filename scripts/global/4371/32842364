<p>I am attempting to learn more about lists in Python, coming from a Java background and being used to arrays. As such, I am wondering if there is a way to check whether or not a certain list element contains a substring. </p>  <p>For instance, suppose I have the following list: </p>  <pre><code>tasks = ['Finish homework', 'Paint bedroom', 'Make dinner', 'Make supper'] </code></pre>  <p>Now, suppose I want to retrieve the entries that entail "making" stuff. That is, obtaining both "Make dinner" and "Make supper". </p>  <p>How can I query this? </p>  <p>So far, I have: </p>  <pre><code>for i in range(0, len(tasks)): #Iterate through list     if "Make" in tasks[i]: #If item contains the word "Make"         print tasks[i] #Print out said item </code></pre>  <p>However, this yields nothing. Any help on this is highly appreciated!</p>
