<p>I was having some problem when trying to check if a string is the substring of another string. Here is the expected output:</p>  <pre><code>Enter a source string: abc Enter the target string: abcde findSubstring(): 1  Enter a source string: abcde Enter the target string: cdef findSubstring(): -1  </code></pre>  <p>And here is my code which used the strstr standard string library:</p>  <pre><code>int main() {     char sourceStr[40], targetStr[40];      printf("Enter a source string: ");     gets(sourceStr);     printf("Enter the target string: ");     gets(targetStr);     printf("findSubstring(): %d\n", findSubstring(sourceStr, targetStr));     return 0; }  int findSubstring(char *s, char *t) {     if (strstr(s, t) != NULL) {         return 1;     }     return 0; } </code></pre>  <p>With these code, it works perfectly. However, I was told that I am not supposed to use any standard string library, so I was thinking how should I modify it?</p>  <p>Sorry for posting the question with no error but I seriously need a head start, as I googled for quite a while and I still have no idea how to do it.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
