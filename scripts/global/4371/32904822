<p>I am looking to replace Latin characters in a vector of strings to normal characters (e.g. é to e, á to a, etc). I am also looking to do this for a large vector, so I will be replacing these characters in a loop. I have attempted to do this with a single  word below:</p>  <pre><code>phrase &lt;- "ÁÉÍÓÚ" spec.elements &lt;- c("[ÁÀÄÉÈËÍÌÏÓÒÖÚÙÜÑÇ]")  if (str_detect(phrase,spec.elements) == TRUE){   str_replace(phrase, "Á", "A") &amp; str_replace(phrase, "Ú", "U") } </code></pre>  <p>and I get the following error:</p>  <pre><code>Error in str_replace(phrase, "Á", "A") &amp; str_replace(phrase, "Ú", "U") :    operations are possible only for numeric, logical or complex types </code></pre>  <p>I also tried the following and the output is clearly not the appropriate result:</p>  <pre><code>&gt; str_replace(phrase, "[ÁÀÄÉÈËÍÌÏÓÒÖÚÙÜÑÇ]", "[AAAEEEIIIOOOUUUNC]") [1] "[AAAEEEIIIOOOUUUNC]ÉÍÓÚ" </code></pre>  <p>Could anyone help me replace all the special characters detected to the regular ones, without opening an if statement for each special character individually?</p>
