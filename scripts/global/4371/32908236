<p>I have a List stopWord(each string is only one word) and I have a string phrases(at least 2 words). I want to check if my phrases includes one of the stopWord's element in Java. How can I do that?</p>  <pre><code>if(!stopWord.contains(phrase.toLowerCase()) String delims = "[ ,-.…•“”‘’:;!()/?\"]+"; </code></pre>  <p>I used this code but I think it doesn't understand String with 2 words which is my phrase. stopWord's each element is single word. I didn't split my phrase. Cuz I'm dealing with large amount of data. Is there a simplier way?</p>
