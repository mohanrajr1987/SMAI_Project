<p>I'm having a big string, which contains few substrings.<br> Each substring starts with a character '#', and ends with either comma or space. <br><br> For example<br></p>  <pre><code>String str = "#ABC xyz,#DEF,xyz #GHI"; </code></pre>  <p>The substrings of above string are</p>  <pre><code>[  "#ABC", "#DEF", "#GHI" ] </code></pre>  <p>How to solve this ? Can we use regex?<br> Please suggest a solution.</p>
