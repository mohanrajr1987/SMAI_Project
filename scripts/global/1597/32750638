<p>I am maintaining an Android application that obtains the current device location as many times per minute as possible using the CommonsWare LocationPoller library. I query for location data every 5 seconds, and on pre-5.1 devices it works perfectly, getting a new location at maximum every 7 seconds but after updating the same device Lollipop the device can only seem to obtain the location every 30 seconds (despite using a WakeLock). Is this a new power saving feature, and if so, can I disable it? </p>
