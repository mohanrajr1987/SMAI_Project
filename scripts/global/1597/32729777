<p>I have an app that utilizes CoreLocation. I have it set that some position information is displayed onscreen while the app is running. I installed the app on my iPhone 6+ and my iPad 3. When I go outside holding both devices a foot apart, they claim that they are 40 feet apart. How can I fix this? My app relies on location information being uniformly correct across multiple devices, so I really need help finding a solution to this. Could it be because one is an iPad? Or that the iPad is older than the iPhone? Also, they are both running iOS 9.</p>
