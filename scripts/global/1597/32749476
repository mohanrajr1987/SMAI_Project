<p>I understand how retrieve locations in background. And I understand that there is a chance to get locations even if terminated <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30522617/continious-location-updates-even-if-app-is-terminated-in-ios">Continious location updates even if app is terminated in iOS</a></p>  <p>But. I have app Moves and Foursquare. If this app even not running (I terminate all apps and no apps running) and then I go to 'Privacy' and change for this apps locations to disable (Never), I can see that arrow in status bar disappeared. But when I enable location updates (Always), arrow again appeared in status bar and apps not running in this moment. So this apps begin take info about locations. How? Even If not launch MOves for some days, this app then show me right route for past days. How they retrieve location info about past days, even app not launching?</p>
