<p>I am trying to make an App that has a different image than the blue dot via Swift that doesnt disappear and always follows like the current blue dot. No blinking, no disappearing, just always moving with the screen. I have tried many things. I have found some answers for other things but none that I can get to work in swift.</p>  <p>For starters I have gone through and set myLocationEnabled = true just to display it. </p>  <p>Secondly I have set the locationManager didUpdatelocation and applied my own marker.image. to an array that updates the current marker, However, It adds a marker every time and disappears and reappears.</p>  <p>/*         if markersArray.count == 0 {</p>  <pre><code>    var degrees : CLLocationDegrees = 90      markersArray.append(marker)     markersArray[0].appearAnimation = kGMSMarkerAnimationPop     markersArray[0].flat = true     markersArray[0].groundAnchor = CGPointMake(0.5, 0.5)     markersArray[0].rotation = degrees     markersArray[0].map = mappedView     markersArray[0].icon = UIImage(named: "ambulance")     print(" has \(markersArray.count) markers")      } else if markersArray.count == 1 {      print("else loop has \(markersArray.count) markers to start")      markersArray[0].map = nil     markersArray.removeAtIndex(0)     } </code></pre>  <p>Using the markersArray.count function I have set it to remove the first item in the array and then loop it back into adding another item that I thought might delete and appears as if this was constantly moving but no luck. This continually updates but still blinks and at times shows two images, which I dont want.</p>  <p>if markersArray.count == 0 {</p>  <pre><code>        markersArray.append(marker)         markersArray[0].appearAnimation = kGMSMarkerAnimationPop         markersArray[0].userData         markersArray[0].flat = true         markersArray[0].groundAnchor = CGPointMake(0.5, 0.5)         markersArray[0].rotation = degrees         markersArray[0].map = mappedView         markersArray[0].icon = UIImage(named: "ambulance")         print(" has \(markersArray.count) markers")      } else if markersArray.count == 1 {          markersArray.append(marker)          markersArray[1].flat = true         markersArray[1].groundAnchor = CGPointMake(0.5, 0.5)         markersArray[1].rotation = degrees         markersArray[1].map = mappedView         markersArray[1].icon = UIImage(named: "ambulance")          print("else loop has \(markersArray.count) markers to start")      } else {          markersArray[0].map = nil      } </code></pre>  <p>Now I am somewhat new to iOS and swift (if that isn't obvious). So my question to you all is how do I make and update my Current Location with a different image that is always keeping up with my current location. I saw that marker.userData was possibly the key but I don't quite understand it. Thanks for your help.</p>
