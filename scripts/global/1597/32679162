<p>I've looked everywhere and in Parse's documentation and am having trouble using and understanding how to get nearby (parse custom objects) users from their geopoints. I need to also display the names of these users who are nearby in sets of table view cells but I need help getting started. </p>  <pre><code>class DiscoverVC: UIViewController {  var userLocation = PFGeoPoint()  override func viewDidLoad() {     queryForTable() }  override func viewDidAppear(animated: Bool) {     queryForTable() }  func queryForTable() -&gt; PFQuery {     let userGeoPoint: PFGeoPoint = self.userLocation     let query: PFQuery = PFQuery(className: "User")     query.whereKey("Location", nearGeoPoint: self.userLocation, withinKilometers: 5)     query.limit = 10     query.includeKey("FirstName")     query.includeKey("LastName")     return query } </code></pre>
