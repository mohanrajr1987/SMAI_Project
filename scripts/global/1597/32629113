<p>Code is here; <a href="https://github.com/googlesamples/android-play-location/blob/master/LocationUpdates/app/src/main/java/com/google/android/gms/location/sample/locationupdates/MainActivity.java" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/googlesamples/android-play-location/blob/master/LocationUpdates/app/src/main/java/com/google/android/gms/location/sample/locationupdates/MainActivity.java</a></p>  <p>Hello, I'm testing out this code, but at <code>startUpdatesButtonHandler()</code> and <code>stopUpdatesButtonHandler()</code> I get the message that these are never used. Where should I use these, have I forgotten something? I used the code linked above. </p>  <p>The lat lon are not being updated, is this because of the start and stop button not being used? I have to refresh the entire activity for it to be updated.</p>
