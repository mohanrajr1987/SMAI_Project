<p>Is there a way to include the altitude when finding address from coordinate? There seems to only have the constructor</p>  <pre><code>List&lt;Address&gt; addresses = geocoder.getFromLocation(latitude,longitude,maxResults); </code></pre>  <p>I don't know much about cartology. But since Google gives me the altitude in <code>Location</code>, I imagine it's important for accuracy.</p>
