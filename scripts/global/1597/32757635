<p>I'm using iTerm 2, and each time I exit and launch it again it doesn't save the folder location I was working on.</p>  <p>This is really annoying to have to retype each time the previous location I was working on, event more when there were multiple tabs opened...</p>  <p>Is there a way so that iTerm automatically save the folder path for each tab when I exit ?</p>
