<p>I'm creating a 'just another task manager' app which heavily relies on the EventKit framework. </p>  <p>What I want to do is to add a geofencing alarm functionality. I've done some research and found the <code>EKAlarm</code> class which according to the docs is just what I need. As a container for those alarms I'm using the <code>EKEvent</code> instance (rather than <code>EKReminder</code>) - this is crucial because I want all my tasks to show app in the Calendar app.</p>  <p>The documentation says the following:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>While geofence-enabled alarms can be applied to events, they are more practical for reminders.</p> </blockquote>  <p>So it is clear that those geofence-enabled alarms <strong>can</strong> be used with events, but the thing is that I just can't make them work - the alarm doesn't get kicked off.</p>  <p>Here is some code I'm using for the alarm creation (it is in Swift yet I'm pretty comfortable with Objective-C):</p>  <pre><code>let structuredLocation = EKStructuredLocation(title: marker.title) structuredLocation.geoLocation = CLLocation(latitude: marker.position.latitude, longitude: marker.position.longitude) structuredLocation.radius = kGeofenceRadius &lt;...&gt; let alarm = EKAlarm() alarm.structuredLocation = structuredLocation alarm.proximity = .Enter event.addAlarm(alarm) </code></pre>  <p>In iOS 8 if I open the Calendar app I can see the created event with <strong>When I arrive</strong> text in the <strong>Alert</strong> section - something you can't achieve using the standard interface. Under iOS 9 though it is different: the interface no longer says anything about the location, instead it shows <strong>On day of event</strong>.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/bnRhG.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/bnRhG.png" alt="EKEvent with location-based EKAlarm on iOS8"></a><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/6Y620.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/6Y620.png" alt="EKEvent with location-based EKAlarm on iOS9"></a></p>  <p>Does anyone have an idea of how to make it work?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
