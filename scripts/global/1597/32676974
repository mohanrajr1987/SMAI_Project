<p>For example:say i have stackOverflow iOS app installed on my iphone and am at any random location. I have a question in mind i wanna ask but i want to ask other people who also have stackOverflow app installed on their iphones who are nearby to my current location (--some threshold in feet) . How can i send those nearby users who may or may not have the stackOverflow app running in foreground , a push notification so they can decide if they want to answer my question. Any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Using GPS to update user location every X minutes does not seem efficient. </p>
