<p>I've been playing with the Twitter Streaming API using the Tweepy library. I started by following my own account and streaming my own tweets as I posted them, which worked fine. </p>  <p>I then attempted to stream a fairly large region's tweets ([30,-85,31,-84]), to which I initially seemed to receive no data. I then started receiving 'Location Deletion Notices', or 'scrub_geo' messages, and have only ever received those since. I changed my code back to the previously working follow code, but I continue to receive 'scrub_geo' messages and not statuses from my profile. </p>  <p>Here's the script I'm using:</p>  <pre><code># Import the necessary methods from tweepy library from tweepy.streaming import StreamListener from tweepy import OAuthHandler from tweepy import Stream  # Other libs import json  # Variables that contains the user credentials to access Twitter API access_token = "&lt;my_access_token&gt;" access_token_secret = "&lt;my_secret_token&gt;" consumer_key = "&lt;my_consumer_key&gt;" consumer_secret = "&lt;my_consumer_secret&gt;"   # This is a basic listener that just prints received tweets to stdout. class StdOutListener(StreamListener):      def on_data(self, data):         #try:         #    json_data = json.loads(data)         #    print json_data['created_at'] + " " + data['text']         #except:         print "Data " + str(data)         return True      def on_error(self, status):         print "Error " + str(status)         if status == 420:             print("420 error.")             return False   if __name__ == '__main__':      # This handles Twitter authetification and the connection to Twitter Streaming API     l = StdOutListener()     auth = OAuthHandler(consumer_key, consumer_secret)     auth.set_access_token(access_token, access_token_secret)     stream = Stream(auth, l)      # Start streaming with right parameters     #tallahassee=[30,-85,31,-84]     #stream.filter(locations=tallahassee)           &lt;---- previously used      stream.filter(follow="&lt;my_user_id&gt;") </code></pre>
