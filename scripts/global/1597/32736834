<p>I'm trying to develop an app available in China. However in this country I would like to get the gps coordinates using Baidu instead of google or the different services given by android.</p>  <p>Using this tuto works but not accurately enough: <a href="http://www.androidhive.info/2012/07/android-gps-location-manager-tutorial/" rel="nofollow">http://www.androidhive.info/2012/07/android-gps-location-manager-tutorial/</a></p>  <p>That's why I wish to use Baidu to get my gps coordinate in China. Someone know how to do it ( I don't speak chinese so the doc is quite useless in my case ) with both chinese and non-chinese android phones? Since the android from China have more possibilities with different chinese services.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
