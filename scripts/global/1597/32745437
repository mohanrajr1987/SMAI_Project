<p>I created GPX file. I started simulate locations through GPX file. It is fully workable solution. But I have a problem.</p>  <p><strong>1)</strong> Run an app and start simulate locations through XCode. It is ok.</p>  <p><strong>2)</strong> Switch off a cable from device.</p>  <p><strong>3)</strong> Restart app on device </p>  <p><strong>4)</strong> I did n’t not get any simulated locations. </p>  <p>Is it possible to simulate locations without connection to XСode?</p>
