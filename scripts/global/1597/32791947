<p>I have an application that uses google play services location receiver. </p>  <p>I would like to test some components of it, and a convenient way to do this would be to be able to simulate or force a location change event to the device I am using for testing. I've found some documentation on sending broadcasts through adb, but I can't find any documentation that specifies if it's possible to send location change events to a device through adb. </p>  <p>If anyone knows how to send a location change event through adb to the device so that Google Play services will recognize a location change that would be perfect. </p>  <p>This seams like it should be possible otherwise how could someone debug their location change code without carrying their computer around enough to trigger a location change event.</p>
