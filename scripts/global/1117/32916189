<p>I have two controls with quite different layout, but their XAML structure is quite similar (same kind of containers and even same element names), so that <em>their code behind is identical</em>. Unfortunately, so far, I had to repeat the code for all event handlers on each of the two classes.</p>  <p>I am now in the process of extracting common functionality to satellite classes, using composition, but still the redundancy of constructors, field declarations, and initialization bothers me a lot.</p>  <p>So the question boils down to:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Is there a way to avoid redundant code behind code when two UserControls have only layout differences, but identical code-behind?</p> </blockquote>
