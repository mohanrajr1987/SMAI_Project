<p>I am working on a windows phone app. I want to copy children of one canvas to other canvas. I can do it with the following code but the problem is I have to remove it from one canvas first. Code is:</p>  <pre><code>private void add_template_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e) {     var childrenList = Template_canvas1.Children.Cast&lt;UIElement&gt;().ToArray();     root.Children.Clear();     foreach (var c in childrenList)     {         Template_canvas1.Children.Remove(c);         root.Children.Add(c);     } } </code></pre>  <p>I want to keep these elements on both the canvas. Is there another way?</p>
