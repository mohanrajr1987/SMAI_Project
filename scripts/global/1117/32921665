<p>Is there a way to write to console / command prompt / powershell (like <code>Console.WriteLine()</code>) or anything similar in UWP apps?</p>  <p>If console is unavailable is there a proper alternative that I can use instead to write to the screen large amounts of text?</p>  <p>I, of course, can make a XAML control and output to it, but it doesn't seem to be convenient in comparison to simple <code>Console.WriteLine()</code>.</p>  <p>There is also very old discussion on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/160587/no-output-to-console-from-a-wpf-application">WPF console</a>, but nothing seems to work from there (at least, I couldn't find <code>Project-Properties-Application tab-Output Type-Console Application</code> and <code>Trace.WriteLine("text")</code> is unavailable).</p>
