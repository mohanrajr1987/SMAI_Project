<p>On the net <a href="http://pastebin.com/AmZ0sB7f" rel="nofollow">somewhere</a> I've found an example that supposedly will disable the user from selecting anything in the grid. They can click as much they wish but I want them not to able to bluefy anything.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;ig:XamGrid.SelectionSettings&gt;   &lt;ig:SelectionSettings CellClickAction="SelectRow" CellSelection="None" /&gt; &lt;/ig:XamGrid.SelectionSettings&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I've adapted it as follows. Now it does what I want <strong>but</strong> the clicked cell gets a border markup anyway. How can I get rid of it?</p>  <pre><code>&lt;ig:XamGridEx.SelectionSettings&gt;   &lt;grids:SelectionSettings RowSelection="None" CellSelection="None" /&gt; &lt;/ig:XamGridEx.SelectionSettings&gt; </code></pre>
