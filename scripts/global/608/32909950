<p>Heres the current .htaccess rule we have on our staging server and it works but it breaks the country sites. \ </p>  <pre><code>RewriteEngine  On  RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^staging-test.asmarterplanet.com [NC,OR]  RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www.staging-test.asmarterplanet.com [NC]  RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.ibm.com/blogs/think$1 [L,R=301,NC] </code></pre>  <p>Need to figure out a way to ignore the country sites within a multisite Wordpress environment. Only the www.staging-test.asmarterplanet.com directory needs to redirect to the new blogs/think site</p>  <p>These are the sites we need to ignore</p>  <pre><code>/es/ /ch/ /se/ /no/ /nl/ /jp/ /dk/ </code></pre>  <p>This directory is the only site we need to accept the redirect “staging-test.asmarterplanet.com “ </p>
