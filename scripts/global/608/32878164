<p>This seems simple, but I just can't get it right.</p>  <p>I need my htaccess to redirect the following:</p>  <p><code>http://example.com/news/</code> to point to <code>news.php</code> with no variables</p>  <p><code>http://example.com/news/page/n</code> to point to <code>news.php?page=n</code>, numbers only</p>  <p><code>http://example.com/news/post/post-title-here</code> to point to <code>news.php?post=post-title-here</code>, only allowing alphanumeric characters and dashes.</p>  <p>No other subdirectories but <code>page</code> and <code>post</code> should be allowed, they should 404.</p>  <p>My last attempt, <code>RewriteRule ^news/([\w\d\-]+)/([\w\d\-]+)$ news.php?$1=$2</code>, 404's when accessing without GET variables, works okay with post and page variable. It also allows all entries, I know, I'm not the greatest with regex.</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
