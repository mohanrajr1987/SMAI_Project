<p>What if I have some internal links on my xampp web server that need to get accessed by external (requests from the internet)?</p>  <p>Lets say  h-ttp://mylocalsite.local/login/    is a link on the site.</p>  <p>if I click on this link  from  <a href="http://externalwebsiteaddress.com" rel="nofollow">http://externalwebsiteaddress.com</a>, which should redirect to my webserver. Can the internal link (mylocalsite) be rewritten to <a href="http://externalwebsiteaddress.com/login" rel="nofollow">http://externalwebsiteaddress.com/login</a> ? Because currently external requests give a "Cannot access this page error" because its internal.</p>  <p>I don't want the internal link to redirect to the external link when accessed from within the network.</p>  <p>Basically if the links are internal , then find a way to service the request from external website successfully, without having to physically change the link on the server.</p>  <p>in other words</p>  <p>If the user is accessing from an external internet link, then find a way to redirect to proper folder using external link so it can be resolved properly. EX: All links start with h-ttp://externalwebsiteaddress/wherever</p>  <p>If user is accessing from internal (inside the network) , then use the local links. EX: All links start with  h-ttp://internaladdress/wherever</p>  <p>Would this be a mod_rewrite?  I am confusing myself way to much.</p>
