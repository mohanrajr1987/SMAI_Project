<p>I have URL on my site like <code>http://costcut.in/view-store.php?id=2</code> (Link 1) I want to change it to <code>http://costcut.in/2</code> (Link 2)</p>  <p>I have used the following lines in my .htaccess file</p>  <pre><code>RewriteEngine on  RewriteBase /  RewriteRule ^/?([0-9]+)$ view-store.php?id=$1 [L] </code></pre>  <p>Now I am able to access both Link1 and Link2 But I want the url Link 1 to be redirected to Link 2</p>  <p>How can I change the links from homepage and other pages to point to Link 2 instead of Link 1?</p>
