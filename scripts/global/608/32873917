<p>I am trying to craft a mod_rewrite conditions and rules so that all requests to a domain other than "/" are re-mapped to a new domain as they are, while requests to "/" are mapped to a particular path on the new domain. </p>  <p>For instance;<br> siteone.domain.com/some/great/path goes to<br> sitetwo.domain.com/some/great/path</p>  <p>while;<br> siteone.domain.com/ goes to<br> sitetwo.domain.com/some/other/path</p>  <p>The first part is easy, and although I've read several howto's on excluding particular directories or files from a mod_rewrite rule, I cannot get the second to work. All my attempts have ended up with;<br> siteone.domain.com/ goes to<br> sitetwo.domain.com/</p>  <p>Following is where I am at now. I am attempting to deal with requests to root first, then everything else;</p>  <pre><code>RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/$ RewriteRule http://sitetwo.domain.com/some/other/path [R=301]  RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^siteone\.domain\.com$ RewriteRule (.*) http://sitetwo.domain.com/$1 [R=301,L] </code></pre>  <p>I'm sure I'm missing something basic, but am going around in circles now.</p>
