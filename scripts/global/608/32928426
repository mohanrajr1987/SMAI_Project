<p>Hi I had problems implementing Social sign on PHP library, now I am looking on adopting Javascript library (hello.js). My problem with PHP library was the redirect method. with my rewrite engine on which direct all to my index.php.</p>  <pre><code>   DirectoryIndex index.php    &lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;        RewriteEngine on        RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off        RewriteRule (.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [R,L]        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d        RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php?page=$1 [L,QSA]    &lt;/IfModule&gt; </code></pre>  <p>My question is if I use a javascript base library, would the redirect call by social providers interfere with my rewrite engine, or vice versa would my rewrite rules interfere with the redirect call?</p>  <p>Note: My web application is PHP 5.5 base.</p>
