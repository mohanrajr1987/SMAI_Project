When user visit these non-exist page, i would like to redirect them to homepage, i.e. mydomain.com</p>  <p>please note, there are also many valid pages under node/  but i only want to redirect non-exist pages under node/</p>  <p>I have tried the following two, none of them works for me</p>  <pre><code>RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/node/ RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d RewriteRule ^(.*)$ / [L,QSA]   RewriteCond  %{REQUEST_URI} !^/node/ RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteRule   ^(.+)         mydomain.com [R=301,L] </code></pre>  <p>Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!</p>
