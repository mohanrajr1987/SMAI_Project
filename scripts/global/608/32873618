<p>I have a basic apache config, something like this:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt; ServerName  example.com ServerAlias *.example.com  DocumentRoot /var/www &lt;Directory /var/www/&gt;     AllowOverride All     &lt;IfModule mod_authz_core.c&gt;         Require all granted     &lt;/IfModule&gt;     &lt;IfModule !mod_authz_core.c&gt;         Order allow,deny         Allow from All     &lt;/IfModule&gt; &lt;/Directory&gt;  ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/error.log CustomLog /var/log/apache2/access.log combined </code></pre>  <p></p>  <p>Now i would like (without having to create another vhost), to setup http auth (or whatever directive) for only test.example.com, would this be possible?</p>  <p>I have looked into using the "Location" param, but that doesn't seem to work with a full url, only non real directories, then i also looked into the alias, but doesn't get me there either.</p>  <p>Any insights are much appreciated!</p>
