<p>I am working in a project in EE that was previously done by somebody else. The problem is that in the image source link -- it is showing as:</p>  <p><code>&lt;img src="http://XXX.XXX.XX.XX/images/news/image.jpg"&gt;</code></p>  <p>but what I want that it be like this:</p>  <p><code>&lt;img src="http://myexample.com/images/news/image.jpg"&gt;</code></p>  <p>What might be the solution? </p>  <p>P.S. i am using ubuntu</p>
