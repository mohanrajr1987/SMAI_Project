<p>Hello I am really bad at understanding how .htaccess and mod_rewrite works.</p>  <p>I would like all requests to a <code>.html</code> file to be redirected to a <code>php</code> file which renders out the requested page. How would I do this, so all page requests like <code>example.com</code>, <code>example.com/index.html</code>, <code>example.com/test.html</code> would all be redirected (internally handled) by index.php?</p>  <p>I tried this</p>  <pre><code>RewriteRule ^(.*)\.html$ $1.php [L,R=301] </code></pre>  <p>But it didn't change a thing?</p>
