<p>Let's say I have the following url: example.com/123456</p>  <p>That url doesn't point to anything - the 123456 is a variable.<br> With PHP and/or htaccess I wonder if I can:</p>  <ol> <li>get the "123456" var </li> <li>push the var into a meta tag in example.com/index.php</li> <li>show the original url in the address bar, but display content redirected from example.com/index.php (123456 is ignored, it's just a dummy url).</li> </ol>  <p>I'm able to do 1 &amp; 2 with an htaccess rewrite.  I have a feeling I can do #3 via javascript, but I wonder if there's a cleaner solution that won't make the address bar change more than needed.  Also, I don't want to be hacky - I wonder if this is a legit process?</p>  <p>Here's what I've got so far with .htaccess:</p>  <pre><code>RewriteEngine on RewriteRule ^([A-Za-z0-9\+/=]+)$ ?t=$1 [NC,R=301,L] </code></pre>  <p>And for the index.php I'm just using:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;meta name="foo" content="https://example.com/&lt;?php echo $_GET['t'] ?&gt;" /&gt; </code></pre>  <p>All this works, but in order to get the meta var in php, the url gets changed to example.com/?t=123456.  I want to display the dummy url: example.com/123456 but show content from example.com/index.php</p>  <p>The difference between my question and the possible duplicate is that I already am using rewrite.  See also the answer to my question, which is nowhere mentioned in the possible duplicate.</p>
