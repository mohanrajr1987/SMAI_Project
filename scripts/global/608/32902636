<p>I am looking to get a rule setup to change one of my URL's. After much research I understand the basics of <code>mod_rewrite</code>. The trouble I am having is the dynamic URL that is being re written. I have outlined in as much detail possible the task and desired outcome. </p>  <p>I currently have a url that looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>http://www.myndness.com/my-canvas/{username}/ </code></pre>  <p>The <code>{Username}</code> is variable depending on which user you click on.</p>  <p>What I need to do is add <code>/?my_posts</code> to the end of that URL. This will then display the posts module by default for all users. </p>  <p>So all the users will follow the same URL pattern:</p>  <pre><code>/User1/?my_posts /User2/?my_posts /User3/?my_posts /User4/?my_posts </code></pre>  <p>Apologies if I have missed anything. </p>  <p>I am using WordPress and have access to all files on the server.</p>
