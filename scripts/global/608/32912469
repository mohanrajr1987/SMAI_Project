<p>I have seen other articles on the same issue. But none of the answers have solved my problem.</p>  <p>I am not using xampp or wamp but have setup php mysql apache seperately. Also I am using my own local domain for instance mytestsite.com. </p>  <p>My .htaccess file looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;      RewriteEngine On     RewriteBase /TestCI/      # Canonicalize Codeigniter URLs      # If your default controller is something other than     # "welcome" you should probably change this     RewriteRule ^(HomeController(/index)?|index(\.php|html?)?)/?$ / [R=301,L]     RewriteRule ^(.*)/index/?$ $1 [L,R=301]      # Removes trailing slashes (prevents SEO duplicate content issues)     RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d     RewriteRule ^(.+)/$ $1 [R=301,L]      # Enforce www     # If you have subdomains, you can add them to      # the list using the "|" (OR) regex operator     RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^(www|TestCI) [NC]     RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.mytestsite.com/$1 [R=301,L]      # Checks to see if the user is attempting to access a valid file,     # such as an image or css document, if this isn't true it sends the     # request to index.php     RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f     RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d     RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php/$1 [L] &lt;/IfModule&gt;  &lt;IfModule !mod_rewrite.c&gt;      # Without mod_rewrite, route 404's to the front controller     ErrorDocument 404 /index.php  &lt;/IfModule&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I have also made following changes in config.php</p>  <pre><code>$config['base_url'] = 'http://mytestsite.com/TestCI/';     $config['index_page'] = ''; $config['uri_protocol'] = 'PATH_INFO'; //AUTO </code></pre>  <p>I have also made following changes in apache2.conf </p>  <pre><code>&lt;Directory /var/www/&gt;         Options Indexes FollowSymLinks         AllowOverride All         Require all granted &lt;/Directory&gt; </code></pre>  <p>But when i try to access </p>  <pre><code>http://mytestsite.com/TestCI/HomeController/ </code></pre>  <p>its showing 404 error but works correctly when using </p>  <pre><code>http://mytestsite.com/TestCI/index.php/HomeController/ </code></pre>  <p>I have looked into several similar questions that have been reported solved, but none of the answers have worked for me. Is there anything else that should be done to remove <code>index.php</code> from the url. Kindly respond back. Help highly appreciated.</p>
