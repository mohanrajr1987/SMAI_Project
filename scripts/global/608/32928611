<p>I have a rewrite rule that redirects www.domain.com to domain.com.  What I want is to modify it so that ANY subdomain will be directed to domain.com.<br> www.domain.com or abc.domain.com or jklmn.domain.com will all be redirected to domain.com.  NOTE that this is not one specific hard-coded domain but needs to address several and so the rule is to find any subdomain and redirect back to its canonical domain. </p>  <pre><code>                    &lt;rule name="HTTP canonical redirect" stopProcessing="true"&gt;                           &lt;match url="^(_*)(.*)" /&gt;                           &lt;conditions logicalGrouping="MatchAll" trackAllCaptures="true"&gt;                                 &lt;add input="{HTTP_HOST}" pattern="^www\.(.*)" /&gt;                           &lt;/conditions&gt;                           &lt;action type="Redirect" url="http://{C:1}/{R:2}" /&gt;                     &lt;/rule&gt; </code></pre>
