<p>I have a reverse proxy setup for a target host. All the requests are made through the proxy to the target host and i have bunch of rewrite rules in apache conf file for the HTTP GET requests. I have a situation where i have to apply a rule for POST requests as well and the rule is based on the param values in the post body of the request.Based on the values in need to do redirection.</p>  <p>Say: post body is  a=b&amp;c=d&amp;e=f  i need to apply some rules on abcd and redirect to a URL.</p>  <p>Any option in apache conf to intercept POST requests?</p>
