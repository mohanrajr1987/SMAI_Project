<p>As we know, SQLite by default does not provide compression</p>  <p>However, SQLite has a few extensions which provide compression. <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/support.html#prosupport" rel="nofollow">https://www.sqlite.org/support.html#prosupport</a></p>  <p>The example given are mostly for C++.</p>  <p>Has anyone ever had any luck enabling compression on C# / DotNet?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
