<p>I am trying to add a whole section to a particular occurence using GemBox. </p>  <pre><code>Section section = new Section(documentModel); documentModel.Sections.Add(section);  ContentRange backgroundCheckSection = documentModel.Content.Find("@@BackGroundChecks").First(); backgroundCheckSection.Start.InsertRange(section); </code></pre>  <p>This code does not work since it cannot implicity conver a ContentRange object to a Section object. The goal is to add that whole section to where the variable @@BackgroundChecks appears. I havent figured out how to do it and was wondering if someone could help me out.</p>
