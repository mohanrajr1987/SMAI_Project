<p>I have 2 players, I want each of them to receive 26 random out of this 52 card deck. Does anyone have any idea how I can give each player, 26 random cards from the 52 card deck? </p>  <p>This should empty the original 52 card Deck Dictionary, and create 2 smaller 26 card deck dictionary.</p>  <p>I have been struggle with this for 3 day, and have done all the research I could do. Here is my Deck Class:</p>  <pre><code>class Deck {     public Dictionary&lt;int, string&gt; CreateNewDeck()     {         Dictionary&lt;int, string&gt; newDeck = new Dictionary&lt;int, string&gt;()         {             {1, "~/cards/c1.png"}, {2, "~/cards/c2.png"}, {3, "~/cards/c3.png"}, {4, "~/cards/c4.png"},             {5, "~/cards/c5.png"}, {6, "~/cards/c6.png"}, {7, "~/cards/c7.png"}, {8, "~/cards/c8.png"},             {9, "~/cards/c9.png"}, {10, "~/cards/c10.png"}, {11, "~/cards/cj.png"}, {12, "~/cards/cq.png"}, {13, "~/cards/ck.png"},             {14, "~/cards/d1.png"}, {15, "~/cards/d2.png"}, {16, "~/cards/d3.png"}, {17, "~/cards/d4.png"},             {18, "~/cards/d5.png"}, {19, "~/cards/d6.png"}, {20, "~/cards/d7.png"}, {21, "~/cards/d8.png"},             {22, "~/cards/d9.png"}, {23, "~/cards/d10.png"}, {24, "~/cards/dj.png"}, {25, "~/cards/dq.png"}, {26, "~/cards/dk.png"},             {27, "~/cards/h1.png"}, {28, "~/cards/h2.png"}, {29, "~/cards/h3.png"}, {30, "~/cards/h4.png"},             {31, "~/cards/h5.png"}, {32, "~/cards/h6.png"}, {33, "~/cards/h7.png"}, {34, "~/cards/h8.png"},             {35, "~/cards/h9.png"}, {36, "~/cards/h10.png"}, {37, "~/cards/hj.png"}, {38, "~/cards/hq.png"}, {39, "~/cards/hk.png"},             {40, "~/cards/s1.png"}, {41, "~/cards/s2.png"}, {42, "~/cards/s3.png"}, {43, "~/cards/s4.png"},             {44, "~/cards/s5.png"}, {45, "~/cards/s6.png"}, {46, "~/cards/s7.png"}, {47, "~/cards/s8.png"},             {48, "~/cards/s9.png"}, {49, "~/cards/s10.png"}, {50, "~/cards/sj.png"}, {51, "~/cards/sq.png"}, {52, "~/cards/sk.png"},         };         return newDeck;     } } </code></pre>  <p>And here is the method I am trying to write to divide the deck As you can probably see, I am a novice:</p>  <pre><code>class Dealer {     public Dictionary&lt;int, string&gt; DealPlayersDeck(Deck deck, Player human, Player computer)     {         Deck cards = new Deck();         Player humanPlayer = new Player();         Player computerPlayer = new Player();          var fullDeck = cards.CreateNewDeck();         var playerDeck = humanPlayer.PlayerCards;         var computerDeck = computerPlayer.PlayerCards;          int halfDeck = fullDeck.Count() / 2;          foreach (object i in fullDeck)         {             List&lt;int&gt; keyList = new List&lt;int&gt;(fullDeck.Keys);             Random rand = new Random();             int randomKey = keyList[rand.Next(keyList.Count)];              if (!playerDeck.ContainsKey(randomKey))             {                 playerDeck.Add(randomKey, fullDeck[randomKey]);                 fullDeck.Remove(randomKey);             }         }         return playerDeck;     } } </code></pre>  <p><a href="http://%20%20https://gist.github.com/bolenton/1c1bac20d389e2fc2e0d" rel="nofollow">Here is a reference Link</a></p>
