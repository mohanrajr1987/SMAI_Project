<p>Using VS 2015 Community (but this is also happening in VS2013) .NET 4 EF 4.3.1 originally installed via nuget Package Manager Console Host Version 3.2.0.10516</p>  <p>In the package manager console I get this warning when I start up one of my projects</p>  <blockquote>   <p>There is already a version of EntityFramework.dll loaded. You may need   to restart Visual Studio for the commands to work properly.</p> </blockquote>  <p>The only refererence to Entity Framework in Packages.config is </p>  <pre><code>  &lt;package id="EntityFramework" version="4.3.1" targetFramework="net40" /&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Which seems good.  </p>  <p>Anyone know whats going on?</p>
