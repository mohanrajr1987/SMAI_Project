<p>I need to come up with regex pattern for this password condition. "Passwords must includes at least 1 number, 1 lower case and 1 uppercase character. No number or letter can appear more than 2 consecutive times.". I know that I can easily do this by looking at each characters but I want to do it in RegEx.</p>  <p>I tried this </p>  <pre><code>"^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)[a-zA-Z\d]$" </code></pre>  <p>but I dont know how to do the 2 consecutive times. Need help guys.</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
