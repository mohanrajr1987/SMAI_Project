<p>Lets say you have some System.Diagnostic.Trace.WriteLine statements in your application and it's working fine.  The someone configures TraceListeners through the application.config to write to a file, maybe the console, etc.  If one of the trace listeners is configured in such a way that the write fails for that particular trace listener, do all the writes fail?</p>  <p>I'd like to use Trace as a means of logging, but am curious what happens if I am logging to the event log and a file, but the event log write fails.  I'd still like the file to work.</p>
