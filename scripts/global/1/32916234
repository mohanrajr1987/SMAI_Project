<p>I have a Visual Studio 2015 solution with 3 C# projects that depend on each other:</p>  <p>Project A -> Project B -> Project C</p>  <p>I would like each of these projects to have their own independently versioned NuGet packages in TeamCity. I also would like to automatically build and publish NuGet packages for downstream projects. </p>  <p>For example, assuming all projects start at version 1.0.0.1, if Project A is updated from v1.0.0.1 to v1.0.0.2, then Project B should be incremented to v1.0.0.2 and rebuilt to reference Project A v1.0.0.2, which in turn triggers Project C to be incremented to v1.0.0.2 and rebuilt to reference Project A v1.0.02 and Project B v1.0.02.</p>  <p>But if Project C is updated from v1.0.0.2 to v1.0.0.3 in isolation, then neither Project A nor Project B should be built and their versions numbers should not be incremented.</p>  <p>I am aware of the -IncludeReferencedProjects NuGet option, but I am not sure how to prevent TeamCity from patching the AssemblyVersionInfos of upstream projects. </p>  <p>Is there a good way to do this in TeamCity or is there an alternative solution to my problem?</p>
