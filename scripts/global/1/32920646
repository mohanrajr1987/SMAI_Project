<p>I have a string from server that contains content string with html tags and smileys are there. </p>  <p>I'm able to get rid of HTML tags with this,</p>  <p>string get_title_with_noHTML = Regex.Replace(get_title, @"&lt;[^>]+>|&nbsp;", "").Trim();</p>  <p>But the smileys are as it is. Not able to get solution for smileys while surfing much. </p>  <p>Here is the windows phone screen Shot: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/nZOm6.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/nZOm6.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>The smileys look like the red square area. I have tried this with RichTextblock but richtextblock hasn't the text property.</p>  <p>How can I get the exact smileys? what would be the possible solution? Thanks in advance!</p>
