<p>I don't know if this problem it's related that I'm using SqliteNetExtensions but attributes here seems to work partially.</p>  <p>I.E. if I declare a column with [Ignore] attribute I see that in my table the attribute exist, so the attribute here it's not considered.</p>  <p>But in other columns, where I'm using TextBlobbed decoration, it seems to work because SqliteNetExtensions serialize it.</p>  <p>Can somebody explain me why and how to make Ignore attribute working?</p>  <p>Thank you</p>
