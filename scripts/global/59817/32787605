<p>I have Visual Studio 2015 Enterprise installed on my Window 10 development machine. I can create a new Universal Windows Platform app and run it both in the simulator as well as on the local machine.</p>  <p>However, when I select any of the 5 pre-installed Mobile Emulators and start debugging, I see the emulator app (XDE.exe) being launched, but then I immediately get an error dialog with the following message:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The emulator is unable to set some properties on the virtual machine: Couldn't change Display controller settings of the virtual machine: .... The configuration version of the Mobile Emulator 10.0.10240.0 WVGA 4 inch ... virtual machine does not support setting resolution type, horizontal resolution or vertical resolution.</p> </blockquote>  <p>When I open the Hyper-V manager, I can see 3 virtual machines installed. I can even start them and they will eventually show the Windows Phone 10 home screen in the expected resolution and orientation.</p>  <p>This happens when running Visual Studio 2015 either as a regular user or as an administrator.</p>
