<p>I have to store on my phone a list of files and folders where the files, depending on mime-type, may have a variable number of attributes (e.g.: image gps coords, song bitrate, video duration, etc.).</p>  <p>I have to make queries fast and simple, so ideally I should probably avoid having multiple tables with a bunch of relations and on the other side the worse scenario is having all the possible columns for every record where only a portion of the records would end up using all (or almost all) the columns.</p>  <p>What do you think might be a good solution for this? Is there any other DB than SQLite that can better fit into this scenario?</p>
