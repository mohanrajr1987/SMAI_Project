<p>I have a windows desktop app done in VB. Can I have same app to work on windows mobile also?</p>  <p>As far as I know windows mobile development is different and windows desktop development is different. Can we have 1 single app that works for both(windows mobile &amp; windows desktop)?</p>  <p>I have developed a windows mobile app before and I had done it through Visual studio(Xaml and C#). I have also worked with windows desktop app visual studio(c#).</p>  <p>If it is possible to have single app for both mobile and desktop then will the existing VB.net app will work? Or do I have to build a separate app from scratch?</p>
