<p>I have a windows phone 8.1 application already in the store. I did not use Test driven development. Yes, this is a typical mistake every developer does. Since writing unit tests will take eons as this is a big project, i am trying to see if i can do write Coded UI tests for different flows(functional testing) of the application. </p>  <p>Is this a good idea? Any suggestions? comments ?</p>
