<p>I have a problem with screen lock on windows phone. I tried to use code below but it did't work:</p>  <pre><code>Display.getInstance().setScreenSaverEnabled(false); </code></pre>  <p>Is there any solution for my problem or Codename One simply doesn't support this feature on Windows Phone?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
