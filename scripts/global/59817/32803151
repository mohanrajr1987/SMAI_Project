<p>I had a Windows Phone 8.1 project running on VS2013. Then, I upgraded to VS2015 and installed the Windows 10 SDK.</p>  <p>After that, when I opened the solution again, there was a message telling me that the project could not be loaded and I'd have to download and install Windows Phone 8.1 SDK.</p>  <p>Done that, everything is working fine, but when I tried to add a WP10 project to the solution it tells me to install the Windows 10 SDK.</p>  <p>Is there a way the two SDKs could be friends and live happily on the same machine?</p>
