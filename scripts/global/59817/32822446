<p>I have a Windows Phone project and my business demands to create another one with some slight changes in the front-end (XAML). How to create another project that is identical to the first one but only the XAML files are different? I don't use MVVM. What I tried is creating a new project and copy the XAML files from the first one, and then LINK all other CS files, but it became a mess with all these namespaces and stuff.. I have resource dicionaries and lots of dependencies in the code. Any ideas how to make such a project that shares the same code-behind files with some differences in Visual Studio?</p>
