<p>I'm trying to get Application Insights added to an existing project, which only flags the following as capabilities:</p>  <pre class="lang-xml prettyprint-override"><code>  &lt;Capability Name="ID_CAP_LOCATION" /&gt;   &lt;Capability Name="ID_CAP_NETWORKING" /&gt;   &lt;Capability Name="ID_CAP_PHONEDIALER" /&gt;   &lt;Capability Name="ID_CAP_MAP" /&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I've added the call in my App's constructor to:</p>  <pre class="lang-cs prettyprint-override"><code>WindowsAppInitializer.InitializeAsync(); </code></pre>  <p>And of course, I've checked the ApplicationInsights.config file to check the InstrumentationKey matches that shown on my portal.</p>  <p>Do I need to add additional capabilities to allow these to work, as I'm not seeing anything show up on the Azure Portal for the subscription, and I'm not seeing anything in the debug output to suggest that any diagnostics are being attempted to be sent?</p>
