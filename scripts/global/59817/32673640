<p>I have a background task that registers when the user enters the app using this code:</p>  <pre><code>            await BackgroundExecutionManager.RequestAccessAsync();              BackgroundTaskBuilder taskBuilder = new BackgroundTaskBuilder { Name = "First Task", TaskEntryPoint = "myTask.FirstTask" };             taskBuilder.SetTrigger(new TimeTrigger(15, false));             BackgroundTaskRegistration myFirstTask = taskBuilder.Register(); </code></pre>  <p>It works fine, and the task registers, however it continues to register again every time the app opens. Is there any way, using <code>if</code>, for example, to detect if a task is registered, therefore only registering a task once and not repeating the same process over and over again? </p>  <p>This problem was discovered by clicking on 'lifecycle events', which revealed about 15 instances of 'First Task', if that helps.</p>
