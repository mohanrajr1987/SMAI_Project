<p>I've read <a href="http://www.diaryofaninja.com/blog/2015/08/30/running-android-apps-on-windows-phone-10-preview" rel="nofollow">here</a> that soon we will be able to release an Android App for Windows Phone 10. Does anybody know what the performance may be like? As far as I know the Windows Phones have pretty solid hardware, but how well does it 'emulate' Android apps?</p>  <p>My app will have:</p>  <ul> <li>3D Map-Rendering</li> <li>GPS</li> <li>Internet</li> <li>...</li> </ul>  <p>Would you expect for this to run smoothly? I tried my app on a Blackberry Z10 (via the Amazon store) but it was unusable. But then again the Blackberry is a pretty bad phone overall.</p>
