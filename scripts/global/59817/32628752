<p>I am running a Windows Phone 8.1 app and I want on startup to get some values from a text file that is stored in "C:\Data\Users\Public\Documents\file.txt"</p>  <p>I don't want to open a UI for that, the application should do it without user intervention. The location is outside my app (i.e. C:\Data...).</p>  <p>How can I do this? </p>  <p>For example:</p>  <pre><code>Uri uri = new Uri(@"C:\Data\Users\Public\Documents\test.txt"); var f = awaitWindows.Storage.StorageFile.GetFileFromApplicationUriAsync(uri); </code></pre>  <p>does not work. It gives an exception: <code>Message = "Value does not fall within the expected range."</code> </p>
