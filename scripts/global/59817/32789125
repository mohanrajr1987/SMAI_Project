<p>I am developing an app (universal windows app) using c# and visual studio 2015. The app will be public and available to any user in the windows store</p>  <p>To integrate OneDrive in windows phone and windows store apps, I need to register the app. I have no problem to register my app for OneDrive (Personal). But I have seen that the register app for <strong>OneDrive for Business</strong> is different, more complex. I need to follow these steps ( <a href="https://dev.onedrive.com/app-registration.htm" rel="nofollow">https://dev.onedrive.com/app-registration.htm</a> ):</p>  <ol> <li>An Office 365 suscription (ok, i've it) </li> <li>Set up an Azure Active Directory tenant (I think I have already made) </li> <li>Register my app with Azure Active Directory (I am confuse)</li> </ol>  <p><strong>Doubts</strong>:</p>  <ul> <li>the URL (i.e: http://{tenant}.sharepoint.com) and client ID generated are unique and common to all users of the app, right? </li> <li>where I can see my "tenant"? is my domain? example, if my suscription is: contoso.microsoft.com , tenant is: contoso ?</li> <li>when I try to register the app in Azure AD, ask me for the URI redirect. URI in native app is the page that I want to redirect the user? ie: mypage.xaml</li> <li>each application user, once logged with his onedrive business o microsoft 365 credentials, will only have access to his OneDrive, right? </li> </ul>
