<p>I have to compare two faces (verify) in Windows Phone. For this, I am using <a href="https://www.projectoxford.ai/face" rel="nofollow">Face API</a> to get <code>faceId</code> and compare the two <code>faceId</code>s. How to have that run in <a href="https://dev.projectoxford.ai/docs/services/54d85c1d5eefd00dc474a0ef/operations/54f0375749c3f70a50e79b82/console" rel="nofollow">Microsoft Project Oxford API Reference</a> with <code>application/octet-stream</code>, i.e., how to send <code>[Image File Binaries]</code>?</p>  <p>Also, I have implemented the sample solution given in <a href="https://www.projectoxford.ai/doc/face/Get-Started/csharp" rel="nofollow">Microsoft Project Oxford Getting started with Face API in C#</a>. The problem that I am encountering here is that I can't send the second parameter of <code>DetectAsync</code> as <code>Stream</code>. How to use <code>Stream</code> in Windows Phone application so as to have this application working? I have tried almost everything.</p>  <p>These are two different problems. First is of how to send the data in the doc page. Second is how to have the application running in Windows Phone.</p>
