<p>Is there an alternative way to register your device in your Developer account? I have so much problems with using the normal way, that is PhoneReg.exe. First of all, after downloading many, many different versions of the Windows Phone SDK and trying them all, I don't even have the PhoneReg.exe executable itself, which means I had to download it from a site. I downloaded the PhoneReg.exe and the DLL which comes with it. And with that I cannot register my device, it keeps saying that it couldn't connect. I have a Lumia 930.</p>  <p>I've tried everything. Restrting the service, another USB cable, port, computer, it just doesn't work.</p>  <p>So thats why Im asking here, is there a more simple alternative for this? I really don't understand why even Apple, who has a lot more complicated way of using devices with profiles, etc. etc. is getting the job better done. Microsoft is really slacking, and with these kind of problems, I'm really hesitant to support the platform, no wonder all these developers are not even bothering with the platform if it doesn't work.</p>
