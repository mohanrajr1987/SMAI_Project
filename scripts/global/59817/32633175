<p>I am trying to submit a Windows Phone 8.0 xap file to the store. It uploads, after the upload it says <em>"Analyzing package"</em>, then <em>"An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later. If the problem continues, contact support."</em></p>  <p>I contacted Microsoft, they told me to clear the cache, history, etc. and try again. I emptied my browsers and restarted, but it didn't work. And I guess the problem is not really about the browsers, because they are able to upload the xap files but they don't get accepted by Microsoft's system.</p>  <p>I also tried an old xap file which was accepted by Microsoft before. I stil get the same error, so that's probably not about my packages.</p>
