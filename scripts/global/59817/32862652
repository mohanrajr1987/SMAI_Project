<p>I just installed Visual studio 2015 community and when I select new project for Windows phone I can't select target version (as show on link) because my dropdown list is empty. Any suggestions on what could be wrong? <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh202937(v=vs.105).aspx" rel="nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh202937(v=vs.105).aspx</a></p>  <p>tnx</p>
