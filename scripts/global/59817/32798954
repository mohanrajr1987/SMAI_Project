<p>I want to add ads in my new windows phone 8.1 RT application. It's been about a year+ since the last time I added Ads in an app and I think that things have changed and new Ads SDKs like Google's came up. So what I would like to know is, what are the options, what's the best I can use or what combinations I can do to have the best result.Thanks!</p>
