<p>I have a question about Caliburn.Micro NavigationService and UWP SplitView control.</p>  <p>There are example of <em>first-level navigation</em> with SplitView : <a href="https://github.com/Caliburn-Micro/Caliburn.Micro/tree/3.0.0/samples/Caliburn.Micro.HelloUWP" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/Caliburn-Micro/Caliburn.Micro/tree/3.0.0/samples/Caliburn.Micro.HelloUWP</a></p>  <p>In this example NavigationService tied to Frame in Content part of SplitView. How can I open new Page without SplitView, i.e. implement <em>second-level navigation</em></p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
