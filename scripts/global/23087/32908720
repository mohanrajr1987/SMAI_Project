<p>I'm in process of building magazine style app that lets users consume info about history. For navigation I use tableview with images in cells. My problem is - they looks good only in iPhone 5, like this:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/iEnNJ.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/iEnNJ.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>and on iPhone 6 it looks stretched, not good, like this</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/zGUFf.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/zGUFf.png" alt="enter image description here"></a> </p>  <p>I think I need different cell sizes and different image sizes based on device. I know, how to make cells dynamic height, but i dont know, how to show images for different aspect ratios on different devices. How can I accomplish that ?</p>
