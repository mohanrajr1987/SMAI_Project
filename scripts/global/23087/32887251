<p>I just noticed different behaviour in my app after upgrading to iOS9. I have a view that shows the device contacts of the phone. </p>  <p>My code is the following:</p>  <pre><code>if (... == YES)     {         ABRecordSetValue(aContact, kABPersonEmailProperty, email, &amp;anError);         if (anError == NULL)         {             ABUnknownPersonViewController *picker = [[ABUnknownPersonViewController alloc] init];             picker.unknownPersonViewDelegate = self;             picker.displayedPerson = aContact;             picker.allowsAddingToAddressBook = YES;             picker.allowsActions = YES;             picker.alternateName = @"John Appleseed";             picker.title = @"John Appleseed";             picker.message = @"Company, Inc";              [self.navigationController pushViewController:picker animated:YES];         } </code></pre>  <p>Then I use the delegate to make a few decisions </p>  <pre><code>- (BOOL)peoplePickerNavigationController:(ABPeoplePickerNavigationController *)peoplePicker shouldContinueAfterSelectingPerson:(ABRecordRef)person                                  property:(ABPropertyID)property identifier:(ABMultiValueIdentifier)identifier     {         //make decisions          return YES or NO;     } </code></pre>  <p>The user taps in a phone number. </p>  <p><strong><em>In IOS8</em></strong> >> Code reaches shouldContinueAfterSelectingPerson and then the native dialler appears</p>  <p><strong><em>In IOS9</em></strong> >> The native dialler appears BEFORE the code reaches shouldContinueAfterSelectingPerson. </p>  <p>Any way to resolve it? </p>
