<p>I came across a need to create a self-sizing textview inside of a table view cell. I tried using auto-layout to determine the size of the cell in conjunction with estimated row heights which worked, but resulted in an obnoxious bouncing effect. I was able to mitigate this by disabling animations on the view. </p>  <p>Is there a way to allow for smooth expansion of the cell without causing the bounce effect on each keypress?</p>
