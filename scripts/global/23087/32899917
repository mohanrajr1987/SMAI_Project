<p>The feed of my app is managed by a UITableViewController where I set custom cells that are instances of a UITableViewCell sub class.</p>  <p>One property of that sub class is a UIButton called flameRelation:</p>  <pre><code>@property (weak) IBOutlet UIButton* flameRelation; </code></pre>  <p>I am creating a dynamic segue to a detail view controller depending on the class of the sender.  If the sender is the cell itself, I pass a given set of data to my detail view controller.  If the sender is the flameRelation button, I pass another.</p>  <p>To achieve this, I am looking at the following 2-step approach:</p>  <p>1) Since I need to know the indexpath.row of the cell where the FlameRelation button was pressed, I set the tag of that button in the UITableView method that sets each cell of my feed as follows:</p>  <pre><code>- (UITableViewCell*)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath {      //Set a bunch of things before setting UIButton flameRelation tag     [cell.flameRelation setTag:indexPath.row]; </code></pre>  <p>And I am printing the tag which allows me to check that the tag is being set when I scroll down my feed after launching my build (I see the numbers incrementing as I scroll down, as expected).</p>  <pre><code>NSLog(@"The button tag for this cell is set to %ld",(long)[cell.flameRelation tag]); </code></pre>  <p>2) In the prepareForSegue method that allows the user to transition to the detail view controller with the relevant information, I test the class of the sender first.  If the class of the sender is UIButton, I attempt to pass the right information to the detail view controller by setting the value of the indexpath to the value of the tag:</p>  <pre><code>- (void)prepareForSegue:(UIStoryboardSegue *)segue sender:(id)sender { if([segue.identifier isEqualToString:@"FlameDetail"]) {     FlameDetailViewController* flameDetailController = (FlameDetailViewController*) segue.destinationViewController;      if ([sender isKindOfClass:[FlameCellTableViewCell class]])     {     NSIndexPath* indexPath = [self.tableView indexPathForCell:sender];     NSLog(@"The indexPath is: %@", indexPath);      flameDetailController.flame = [self.feed flameAtIndex:indexPath.row];      NSLog(@"class for object sender: %@", NSStringFromClass([sender class]));     }       else if ([sender isKindOfClass:[UIButton class]])     {         NSLog(@"The button tag is set to %ld",(long)[sender tag]);         NSIndexPath* indexPath =  [NSIndexPath indexPathForRow:[sender tag] inSection:0];         NSLog(@"The indexPath from UIButton is: %@", indexPath);          flameDetailController.flame = [self.feed flameAtIndex:indexPath.row];         NSLog(@"The value of indexPath.row is %ld",(long)indexPath.row);          NSLog(@"class for object sender: %@", NSStringFromClass([sender class]));         flameDetailController.findOutView.hidden = NO;         [flameDetailController.flameAction setTitle:@"CHAT NOW" forState:UIControlStateNormal];         NSLog(@"Yes, the sender is UIButton");         NSLog(@"The title of flameAction is set to %@", flameDetailController.flameAction.titleLabel.text);     } } </code></pre>  <p>Everything works well if I tap on the cell itself, but if I tap on the flameRelation button, I see in my logs that the getter on tag returns 0.  Which obviously doesn't transfer the proper information to my target view controller.</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
