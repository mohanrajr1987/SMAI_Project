<p>I am unable to make dynamic increment of rows in table view (It is probably because I have added the table view in collection view) whereas in other situation I have practiced the similar code in table view only and it is working fine.  I want to know the possible reasons and solutions as I am restricted to use the code in table view under collection view.</p>  <p>I am using auto layout and UITableViewAutomaticDimension. </p>
