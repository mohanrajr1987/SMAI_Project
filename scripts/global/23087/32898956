<p>I have a <code>tableView</code> with the bottom of low hanging characters (g, p, q, etc) in <code>detailTextView</code> being cut off. Changing the font size and cell height doesn't seem to fix the problem. I can't set values of the cells labels so I am out of ideas. Any help?</p>  <p>Here is a pic of an example.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/iS1G4.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/iS1G4.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
