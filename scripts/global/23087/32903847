<p>I have a tableview setup whereby every row has its own custom section header. This is done with a prototype cell in the story board. I have a segue to a view controller on the click event of a row. I achieved this by ctrl dragging on the storyboard.</p>  <p>I want my section header to segue to a different controller, however. I ctrl dragged from my header prototype cell to a view controller on the storyboard also. </p>  <p>The result is that both clicking on the row and clicking on the header of the row are bringing me to the same view controller.</p>  <p>It seems the header is linked to the row. Is there any way around this? Could I give my segues identifiers and override the prepare for seg? Or is it possible to have a separate click event on a section header as the rest of the row?</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I have to tried to implement it as follows:</p>  <p>I ctrl dragged from my vc to the destination vc in the storyboard and gave the seg an identifier.</p>  <p>In my viewForHeaderInSection, I have added the following:</p>  <pre><code>let tapper = UITapGestureRecognizer(target: self, action:Selector("seg")) tapper.cancelsTouchesInView = false headerCell.addGestureRecognizer(tapper) return headerCell </code></pre>  <p>my seg func just perform a seg with the identifier I set up as explained above.</p>  <pre><code>func seg(){         self.performSegueWithIdentifier("feedToMembersDetailed", sender: self) } </code></pre>  <p>In my overridePrepareForSeg, I check the identifier and call the appropriate method:</p>  <pre><code>override func prepareForSegue(segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: AnyObject?) {          if (segue.identifier == "feedToMembersDetailed"){             //getting in here             getMembersContentFromRow(segue)         }         ... extra conditions     } </code></pre>  <p>and finally my getMembersContentFromRow looks as follows:</p>  <pre><code>func getMembersContentFromRow(segue : UIStoryboardSegue){         var membersDetailed = segue.destinationViewController as! MembersDetailedController         if let indexPath = self.feedTableView.**indexPathForSelectedRow()**{             if let selectedId = self.newsFeed?[indexPath.section].authorId{                 Prefs.followedId = selectedId.toInt()!             }             println("setting postAuthorPic as \(self.newsFeed?[indexPath.section].authorPic)")             membersDetailed.postAuthorPic = self.newsFeed?[indexPath.section].authorPic             membersDetailed.postAuthorID = self.newsFeed?[indexPath.section].authorId             membersDetailed.postAuthor = self.newsFeed?[indexPath.section].author          }         else{             //getting in here. I need a method that can retrieve indexPath for me             println("could not get selected row")         }     } </code></pre>
