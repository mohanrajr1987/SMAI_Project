<p>When doing a deployment with Elastic Beanstalk, we got the following error:</p>  <p><em>ERROR: Configuration validation exception: Invalid option value: 'sg-fdd33e89' (Namespace: 'aws:autoscaling:launchconfiguration', OptionName: 'SecurityGroups'): The security group having id 'sg-fdd33e89' does not exist.</em></p>  <p>Things probably related:</p>  <ul> <li>We have custom security group settings for the ELB in .ebextensions</li> <li>We had earlier cloned this particular EB environment from an older EB environment and had problems with being unable to temrinate the old environment because of this security group.</li> </ul>  <p>(Already solved this but sharing the question in case it helps somebody else)</p>
