<p>I'm trying to learn how to use the gem, Amazon-ecs, with Ruby on Rails and found a project that is a bit outdated.<br> Link:<a href="https://github.com/twler/amazon-ecs-sample" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/twler/amazon-ecs-sample</a> </p>  <p>When I run 'rails s', I get this error<br> Link: <a href="http://puu.sh/kviQy/9a70448449.png" rel="nofollow">http://puu.sh/kviQy/9a70448449.png</a></p>  <p>This error is probably because I have to fill in the keys, but I am not sure how to do it.</p>  <pre><code>Amazon::Ecs.options = {   :associate_tag =&gt; '[Your Associate Tag]',   :AWS_access_key_id =&gt; '[Your Access Key ID]',          :AWS_secret_key =&gt; '[Your Secret Key]' } </code></pre>  <p>How can I run this application on localhost? And how can I get started in an empty Ruby on Rails project?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
