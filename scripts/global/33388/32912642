<p>How do you set the <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> header of an S3 object using version 1 of the AWS SDK for Ruby. The <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSRubySDK/latest/AWS/S3/S3Object.html#write-instance_method" rel="nofollow">docs here</a> show how to set a variety of headers, but there doesn't seem to be anything for the access control header. It does mention a <code>:metadata</code> option, but that prefixes the values with <code>x-amz-meta</code>, which is not what I'm looking for.</p>  <p>The reason I ask is because I'm trying to download a publicly readable file in S3 (which I put there) by making an Ajax call from Javascript. I have set the ACL to public read, which means I can view it in a browser, but I get the <code>No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource</code> error from the Ajax call.</p>
