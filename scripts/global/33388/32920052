<p>I've (hopefully) successfully set up Cpanel on AWS with clustering following the instructions: <a href="https://blog.cpanel.com/part-1-how-i-built-a-cpanel-hosting-environment-on-amazon-aws/" rel="nofollow">https://blog.cpanel.com/part-1-how-i-built-a-cpanel-hosting-environment-on-amazon-aws/</a></p>  <p>I've been using CPanel/WHM on a dedicated server for a few years before I set up this new Cpanel installation on AWS. My issues comes from how new accounts are set up differently on a dedicated server vs the AWS way.</p>  <hr>  <p><strong>My first issue:</strong> </p>  <p>When I created a new account on my dedicated WHM, I was provided IP Addresses from the server farm that I assigned to newly created accounts. Once assigned, I can access the site with either the IP or the domain name. Now with this new AWS way, there's no info in the tutorials about how I obtain new IP Addresses. I tried adding a new local IP like 10.0.0.30 (because it says it's in NAT mode and use local IP) and assigning this as a dedicated IP to the newly created accounts but I don't understand how anybody can access the site through that IP since its a local IP. So how do I access the domain through custom IP and domain like I did before? I must be missing something fundamental.</p>  <hr>  <p><strong>My second issue:</strong></p>  <p>On my dedicated WHM after I created a new account, I would typically go to DNS Functions -> Edit DNS Zone and edit the zone to customize my nameserver as so:</p>  <p><code>mynewdomain.com ns1.mynewdomain.com  ns2.mynewdomain.com</code></p>  <p><code>anothersite.com ns1.anothersite.com ns2.anothersite.com</code></p>  <p><code>thirdsite.com ns1.thirdsite.com ns2.thirdsite.com</code></p>  <p>and then in my register I would add these custom nameservers into the register and point them to the dedicated IPs of each domain. But with the AWS way, the only way I was able to set this up was to use the new cluster nameservers as the nameserver for <strong>ALL</strong> accounts in this new WHM installation.</p>  <p>Like this:</p>  <p><code>mynewdomain.com ns1.awsnameserver.com ns2.awsnameserver.com</code></p>  <p><code>anothersite.com ns1.awsnameserver.com ns2.awsnameserver.com</code></p>  <p><code>thirdsite.com ns1.awsnameserver.com ns2.awsnameserver.com</code></p>  <p>Is this the correct / the only way I can set up accounts now through this set up? Is there a way to have custom nameservers names like I did in dedicated WHM? </p>
