<p>It doesn't seem to me that the Windows side is ready at all. I can't even launch any instances whatsoever. I have been trying to start a t2.small and t2.micro windows 2012 R2 base instances. The console will say it is in "booting" state for a long time and then to "running_setup" if i am lucky. That is it. It won't go further. I went to the box with EC2 admin RDP. I could see that the Opswork agent service is running. So, it is not permission problem trying to fetch the opswork agent installer. Chef and Git are installed too. Seriously, did anyone have success at all? I am not even doing customization. It is just simple add layer, add instance, and launch. I spent the whole day trying to it working, not to mention money! </p>  <p>Very frustrated! Amazon!</p>
