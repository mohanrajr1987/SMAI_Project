<p>I receive log files into a bucket, say named 'my-bucket'. They all have an underscore ('_') on their filename, ie:  </p>  <pre><code>s3://my-bucket/_file1.gz   s3://my-bucket/_file2.gz   s3://my-bucket/_file3.gz   etc.   </code></pre>  <p>When I do:</p>  <pre><code>a = load 's3://my-bucket/*'; dump a; </code></pre>  <p>it does not find any files.</p>  <p>I did some research, and it appears that pig treats files with . and _ prefixes as hidden, and does not load them. I wrote a script with boto to remove the prefix, and then I can load the files, but it takes a long time to run since it copies the files.</p>  <p>Is there a way to tell Pig not to ignore '_' prefixed files?</p>  <p>Thanks for any help!</p>
