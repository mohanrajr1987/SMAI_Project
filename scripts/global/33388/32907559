<p>I have a site myexample.com hosted on aws using EC2 Ubuntu stack. I installed wordpress and pointed blog.myexample.com to it.</p>  <p>The blog works fine except wordpress cannot write to the wp-uploads folder. Error: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Unable to create directory wp-content/uploads Is its parent directory writable by the server?</p> </blockquote>  <p>I have changed the permissions on the folders (777, 775) but it made no difference. It seems to be an ownership problem. Amazon recommend doing this: <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/hosting-wordpress.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/hosting-wordpress.html</a></p>  <p>Add the apache user to the www group.</p>  <pre><code>[ec2-user wordpress]$ sudo usermod -a -G www apache </code></pre>  <p>Change the file ownership of /var/www and its contents to the apache user.</p>  <pre><code>[ec2-user wordpress]$ sudo chown -R apache /var/www </code></pre>  <p>Change the group ownership of /var/www and its contents to the www group.</p>  <pre><code>[ec2-user wordpress]$ sudo chgrp -R www /var/www </code></pre>  <p>Change the directory permissions of /var/www and its subdirectories to add group write permissions and to set the group ID on future subdirectories.</p>  <pre><code>[ec2-user wordpress]$ sudo chmod 2775 /var/www [ec2-user wordpress]$ find /var/www -type d -exec sudo chmod 2775 {} + </code></pre>  <p>Recursively change the file permissions of /var/www and its subdirectories to add group write permissions.</p>  <pre><code>[ec2-user wordpress]$ find /var/www -type f -exec sudo chmod 0664 {} + </code></pre>  <p>Is there a risk that I will affect the existing websites on this server? There are two.</p>  <p>Are there any risks to doing this? </p>  <p>I cannot afford to make a mistake and impact the existing sites.  Thanks!</p>
