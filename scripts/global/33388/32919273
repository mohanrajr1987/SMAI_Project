<p>I'm getting acquainted with using S3 with ruby to upload files to Amazon Web Service.  I recently was confronted with the following error: <code>AWS::S3::Errors::AccessDenied Access Denied</code>.  In poking around on google, I found <a href="http://rexstjohn.com/how-to-solve-access-denied-with-heroku-paperclip-s3-ror/" rel="nofollow">this post</a> on the error.  It claims that the bucket policies aren't sufficient to allow access via the web-app and that the user must be given "Administrator Access" as well.  </p>  <p>I've given this a try and it works fine but I feel like this is an indication that I'm not doing it right, given that administrator access isn't mentioned in any other documentation I've read.  I'm using the aws-sdk gem.  Could anyone weigh in on whether admin access is necessary?  Many thanks!</p>
