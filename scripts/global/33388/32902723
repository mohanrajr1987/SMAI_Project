<p>I know there are similar posts, but I've followed many instructions on installing python. (I'm no linux expert)</p>  <p>But I've constantly hit different problems...</p>  <p>The latest problem was this error:</p>  <pre><code>Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement Twisted&gt;=10.0.0 (from scrapy) (from versions: )  Some externally hosted files were ignored as access to them may be unreliable (use --allow-external Twisted to allow). No matching distribution found for Twisted&gt;=10.0.0 (from scrapy) </code></pre>  <p>This is my third try after wiping the server clean and starting from scratch.</p>  <p>Can someone help me with setting up python 2.7.10 and scrapy in a CentOS 6.7 AWS server? What do other dev tools do I need to install beforehand?</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong> </p>  <p>I'm accessing the CentOS AWS server through putty and I've read that I shouldn't overwrite python 2.6.6 on it. I've installed python 2.7.10 on it successfully. </p>  <p>I know this because the <code>python</code> command opens the 2.6.6 IDLE while <code>python2.7</code> opens 2.7.10.</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>  <p>I have two instances of Python now the system python 2.6.6 and python 2.7.10.</p>  <p>I also installed a virtualenv of 2.7.10 and installed scrapy.</p>  <p>Now my problem is this whenever I try to open the scrapy shell:</p>  <pre><code>libpython2.7.so.1.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory </code></pre>
