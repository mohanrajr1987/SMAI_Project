<p>I signed up for AWS and am trying to play around with their API. </p>  <p>What I want to do is use their REST API to search for books via a book title and get the results back in a JSON string.</p>  <p>I think this is the correct method:</p>  <p><a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSECommerceService/latest/DG/EX_SearchingbyTitle.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSECommerceService/latest/DG/EX_SearchingbyTitle.html</a></p>  <p>And the example they provide is:</p>  <pre><code>http://webservices.amazon.com/onca/xml?    Service=AWSECommerceService   &amp;Operation=ItemSearch   &amp;ResponseGroup=Small   &amp;SearchIndex=Music   &amp;Title=Blue   &amp;AWSAccessKeyId=[Your_AWSAccessKeyID]   &amp;AssociateTag=[Your_AssociateTag]   &amp;Timestamp=[YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ]   &amp;Signature=[Request_Signature] </code></pre>  <p>I am a little confused about the parameters...</p>  <p><code>AWSAccessKeyId</code> = This I was able to generate by clicking going in the console and on the top right clicking on My Name->Security Credentials -> Access Keys.</p>  <p><code>AssociateTag</code> - What is this?</p>  <p><code>Timestamp</code> - I have to pass in a timestamp? Why?</p>  <p><code>Signature</code> - What is this?</p>  <p>And finally I want to only search books. Does this mean that <code>SearchIndex</code> should be set to <code>Books</code>?</p>  <p>Thanks for helping out a noob!</p>
