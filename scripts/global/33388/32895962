<p>Is there any way to get the port that the application must bind in <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/customize-containers-ec2.html#customize-containers-format-container_commands" rel="nofollow">container_commands</a> in Elastic Beanstalk?</p>  <p>The Java application that I'm trying to deploy uses a configuration file to determine the port it will bind and I'm using <code>container_commands</code> to create that file. However; it seems that <code>PORT</code> environment variable is not available in <code>container_commands</code>. It's is only available in <code>Procfile</code> but the application doesn't support VM options or program arguments.</p>
