<p>I'm trying to find the correct permissions setup for a WordPress site running on Bitnami / EC2. Right now, my /apps/wordpress/htdocs directory is set to daemon:bitnami. With this setup the site works, but I can't install or update plugins. I also can't edit anything over FTP. The FTP user is "ubuntu".</p>  <p>I've tried changing the /htdocs/ owner to ubuntu, which lets me edit files via FTP, but then site won't load.</p>  <p>I've read this post <a href="http://blog.david-jensen.com/wordpress-amazon-ec2-apache-permissions-wordpress/" rel="nofollow">http://blog.david-jensen.com/wordpress-amazon-ec2-apache-permissions-wordpress/</a> which suggests changing the owner to apache:apache, but I don't think this is applicable to Bitnami installs... and I'm worried about further messing up permissions.</p>  <p>What is the ideal permissions / user setup to allow editing via FTP and plugin updates without having to enter credentials, without compromising security?</p>
