<p>I've noticed some Elastic Beanstalk is drawing about $20 to $30 every month on my AWS account and it turns out it is an empty S3 bucket.</p>  <p>I tried deleting it but it returns "Access Denied" error.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/M5a5i.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/M5a5i.png" alt="Access Denied"></a></p>  <p>I also tried to use life cycle to remove it, but it also didn't work. Here is how I set up the life cycle:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/F8C3T.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/F8C3T.png" alt="Life Cycle"></a></p>  <p>I set it to remove 1 day after creation</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/4u7k8.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/4u7k8.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
