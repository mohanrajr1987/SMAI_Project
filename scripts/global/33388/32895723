<p>using the AWS Ruby SDK v2<br> trying to get <code>IAM/account_autorization_details</code>  </p>  <p><a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkforruby/api/Aws/IAM/Client.html#get_account_authorization_details-instance_method" rel="nofollow">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkforruby/api/Aws/IAM/Client.html#get_account_authorization_details-instance_method</a>  </p>  <p>Everything works as expected, but I would like to get the output in json format (sort of how the awscli dumps it: like <code>aws iam get-account-authorization-details</code>)  </p>  <p>I'm not interested in exploring the results manually. I need to store the json for later audit purposes. Cannot use the awscli and I am doing multiple things (calling multiple services + logic in between) through the SDK and the result needs to be self contained.</p>
