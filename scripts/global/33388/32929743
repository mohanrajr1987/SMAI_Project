<p>We're running AWS RDS(mysql) with 2 replicas and need more replicas.<br> However, we've failed making the 3rd replica that is synchronized with master.<br> When I create new 3rd replica, its replica lag keeps increased forever.  </p>  <p>What we've tried were,</p>  <ul> <li>making same instance type of all replicas with master one (r3.4xlarge)</li> <li>tweak innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit, sync_binlog to 0 on replica side.</li> <li>tried creating new replica when write operation is the lowest (870 write IOPS, 191.89 inserts/s, 355.97 updates/s, 25.45 deletes/s, 139477.05 reads/s)</li> </ul>  <p>show processlist tells<br> |  2 | system user |                 | NULL         | Connect | 4816 | Waiting for master to send event | NULL             |<br> |  3 | system user |                 | NULL         | Connect | 7823 | System lock                      | NULL             |</p>  <p>or DML queries are processed.<br> It seems like replica is processing bin log so slowly. However other replicas (1st are 2nd working okay)</p>  <p>Can anyone have experienced similar issue or know what's the problem?<br> Thank you</p>
