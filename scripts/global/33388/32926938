<p>A bit lost on where to start after exploring digitalcoean/aws.</p>  <p>I have looked at the documentation for <a href="https://www.docker.com/" rel="nofollow">docker</a> and <a href="https://github.com/boto/boto3" rel="nofollow">boto3</a>, and docker seems to be the direction I want to go in (docker for AWS), but I am unsure that these are mutually exclusive solutions.</p>  <p>From what I understand the following workflow is possible:</p>  <ol> <li>Code local python (most any language, but I am using py)</li> <li>Deploy local code (aka upload) to a server</li> <li>Call that code from a local machine with some argument(s) via a script leveraging some cloud API (boto3/docker?)</li> <li>Grab finished result file from my cloud (pull file that is JSON/CSV etc and contains my results) using an API (boto3/docker?)</li> </ol>  <p>I thought this would be way easier to get up and running (maybe it is, and I am just missing something).</p>  <p>I feel like I am hitting my head against the wall on something that is intended to not be so tough.</p>  <p>Any pointers/guidance are hugely appreciated.</p>  <p>Thank you!</p>
