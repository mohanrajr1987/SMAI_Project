<p>Has anyone gotten the AWS API Gateway to work with an Angular.js front-end?  I have a lambda function that's exposed via a POST method in the API Gateway.  I set up the headers as indicated by this doc:  <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/how-to-cors.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/how-to-cors.html</a></p>  <p>I tested it in Postman and it works great.  I didn't have to do anything special, but when I do the <code>$http.post()</code> call I only get <code>No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin'</code> header is present on the requested resource. Origin <code>http://localhost:9000</code> is therefore not allowed access. The response had <code>HTTP status code 500.</code> as the response.</p>
