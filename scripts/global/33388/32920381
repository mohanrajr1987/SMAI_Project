<p>I have several ec2 instances on AWS and I was wondering which is the best way to organize them in order to keep order. As far is I know, it is not possible to group such instances e.g. with the help of a folder or something similar. So the solution I came up with is to stick to a  naming convention. So, the names of my instances will look as follows:</p>  <ul> <li>examplecustomer-ubuntu-14.0.4-t2.micro-1</li> <li>examplecustomer-ubuntu-14.0.4-t2.micro-2</li> <li>examplecustomer1-ubuntu-14.0.4-t2.micro-1</li> <li>examplecustomer1-ubuntu-14.0.4-t2.micro-2</li> </ul>  <p>Now I have several users/customers which should just see specific instances (e.g. customer1 should only see instances starting with examplecustomer1). Therefore, I created a policy and attached it to the user. My idea was to use a wildcard within the ARN-Resourcepath, but that doesnÂ´t seem to work. Does anyone have an idea how to achieve that?</p>  <p><strong>Example policy:</strong></p>  <pre><code>  {   "Version": "2012-10-17",   "Statement": [     {       "Sid": "Stmt1443859866333",       "Action": "ec2:*",       "Effect": "Allow",       "Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:region:account-id:instance/customer1*"     }   ] } </code></pre>  <p>I was unable to find a solution by follogwing the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/de_de/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html#arn-syntax-ec2" rel="nofollow">documentation</a></p>
