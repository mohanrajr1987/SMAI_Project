<p>If I create this pod:</p>  <pre><code>apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: name: dsm-manager spec: containers: - name: dsm-manager image: ****** imagePullPolicy: Always command: - /sbin/init volumeMounts: - mountPath: /srv/project/DSMManager/snapshots name: dsm-snapshot-storage volumes: - name: dsm-snapshot-storage awsElasticBlockStore: volumeID: aws://us-west-2b/vol-43e44482 fsType: ext4 imagePullSecrets: - name: dockerregistrykey </code></pre>  <p>It always works, but if I delete it and re-create it it gets stuck with status 'CreatingContainer'. Looking in the events yields:<br> -Unable to mount volumes for pod "dsm-manager_default": Timeout waiting for volume state<br> -Error syncing pod, skipping: Timeout waiting for volume state</p>  <p>If I delete the pod and re-create it the same thing happens no matter what I do. However if I attach the volume to some instance and then detach it through the aws cli, then create the pod it works find. I'm wondering if the volume isn't being detached properly. For now I just have this odd work flow of attaching the volume to a random instance then detaching it while updating the container image</p>
