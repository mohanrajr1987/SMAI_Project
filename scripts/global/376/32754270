<p>I have added a silverlight control to my lightswitch screen. I have designed the xml file of the silverlight user control and to display data of the lightswitch screen in the user control i have done binding in usercontrol .xml file i.e "Binding={Screen.PurchaseItem.Id}", up to this extent this works fine. But now my next step is to access that binded data in my usercontrol .cs file. I have been searching from number of days for the solution. But now i am really stucked. I will be really thankful for your help and suggestions.</p>
