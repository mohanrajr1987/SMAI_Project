<p>For my Silverlight application I've defined several custom RIA functions. I want to add a new parameter to one of this functions which is a bidimensional string array.</p>  <p>I can compile the code, but when I use the application every call to a WCR-RIA function ends up into a CommunicationException. If I remove the bidimensional string array parameter everything works fine again.</p>  <p>Is there someting special to do to be able to use two dimensional arrays with WCF-RIA ?</p>
