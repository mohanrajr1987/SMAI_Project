<p>We are experiencing this odd bug on some client machines. The weird thing is that OOB version that is ran in some sort of IE is super slow, like 200x slower than the IE version itself. The FireFox version also is fast.</p>  <p>There must be something about these machines, because the issue is rather rare. Does anyone have a clue what could be wrong?</p>
