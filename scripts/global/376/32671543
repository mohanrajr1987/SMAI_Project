<p>i am working on an asp.net web application, where tasks are assigned to users, we set standard time to every task, in that standard time period the user has to finish the task, there are two buttons on the page, proceed and save, when a user clicks on proceed button, the time is saved in database as starttime, and when the user clicks on save button, the time is saved in database as endtime. this way we are capturing the time period within which the user is completing the task.</p>  <p>the standard time is set on an average time study basis, not every time the task takes the same amount of time.</p>  <p>often users can complete the task in very less time than the standard time, in this case the users are proceeding the task and even after completing the task, instead of saving it, they lock the system and go for tea breaks and after coming from break, they save the task.</p>  <p>i want to save some information on the web page when they lock the pc even when the browser is minimized.</p>  <p>i tried implementing applet using jintellitype library but its not capturing the key combinations that are used by windows os.</p>  <p>i also tried using Silverlight but there is no such support as in winforms application in Silverlight, i have to create a com component or something that interacts with system32 or some native api. it doesn't seem easy for me, i would like to know if there is such library for Silverlight.</p>  <p>it should be browser independent, i haven't tried ActiveX, but i think it can be done using ActiveX, but i don't want to use ActiveX as it runs only on IE.</p>  <p>i want to know all the possible solutions to achieve this.</p>  <p>thanks in advance.</p>
