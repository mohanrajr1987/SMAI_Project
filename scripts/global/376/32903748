<p>I've recently been given an old version of someones code to update. When I open the solution one of the projects doesn't have a .CSPROJ file inside the project and it is causing the project to not load.</p>  <p>The project has been working on the someone else's machine 12 months ago and when speaking to them they didn't have the file either.</p>  <p>We don't know what project type it was created under so we unable to recreate the file.</p>  <p>Here is the error:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Rjn5S.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Rjn5S.png" alt="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Rjn5S.png"></a></p>  <p>The files are all still in the project file in my browser window:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/uTQv6.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/uTQv6.png" alt="http://i.stack.imgur.com/uTQv6.png"></a></p>  <p>How can I recreate the .CSPROJ file I need?</p>  <p><strong>EDIT: As mentioned i cannot recreate the project as i don't know what project type it is.</strong></p>
