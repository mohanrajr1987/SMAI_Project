<p>How do you access the Main UI Thread in Windows Phone 8.1 Silverlight?  I recently upgraded a rather large project from Windows Phone 8.0 to 8.1 Silverlight App.  Now everything runs on a worker Thread and <code>Dispatcher.BeginInvoke</code> no longer works.  Even when the app is launched using <code>Application_Launching</code> event it is on the Worker Thread, page navigation coming into the OnNavigateTo methods come in on the worker threads??  </p>  <p>How do I access the Main UI Thread in Windows Phone 8.1 Silverlight?</p>  <p><code>Dispatcher.BeginInvoke</code> no longer works.</p>  <p><code>Dispatcher.RunAsync</code> does not exist only <code>InvokeAsync</code> and neither of these works just runs the code on a Worker thread.</p>  <pre><code>var dispatcher = Windows.UI.Core.CoreWindow.GetForCurrentThread().Dispatcher; await dispatcher.RunAsync(Windows.UI.Core.CoreDispatcherPriority.Normal,    () =&gt; DoSomething()); </code></pre>  <p>Throws an unhandled exception and does not work.</p>  <p>Can anyone lend me any advice or tips in this matter???</p>
