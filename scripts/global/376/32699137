<p>I am suddenly unable to run any of my Silverlight projects. When I try to I get a message "You need to install the latest Silverlight Developer runtime before opening Silverlight project . It next brings up a Window that says Install Silverlight 5 for Developers. When I click "Install Now". I get a message Unable to Install Silverlight, followed by another message in smaller type "A 64-bit version of Silverlight is already installed". I tried uninstalling and reinstalling Silverlight and Silverlight of Visual Studio to no avail. </p>
