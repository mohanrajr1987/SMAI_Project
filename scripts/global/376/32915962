<p>Currently trying to click a button inside of a silverlight web app, and yes I know beforehand silverlight is not supported but I think at least it worth a try with the action chain module. Here is the best I could come up with until now:</p>  <pre><code>profile = FirefoxProfile() profile.set_preference('plugin.default.state', 2) driver = webdriver.Firefox(profile) driver.get('http://www.trypython.org') time.sleep(8) sldiv = driver.find_element_by_xpath('//*[@id="silverlightControlHost"]') builder = ActionChains(driver) builder.move_to_element_with_offset(sldiv, 372, 44) builder.click() </code></pre>  <p>IT is not clicking, or at least not in the expected coordinates (where the button is). Will I get away with this? if so, will I be able to type some text after clicking inside a textbox? </p>  <ul> <li>Do not even mention silverlight-selenium outdated project</li> </ul>
