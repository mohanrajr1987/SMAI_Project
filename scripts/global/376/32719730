<p>We are looking for solution to resolve strange IE browser behaviour when Mixed Content Warning Dialog appears.</p>  <p>We develop a video platform based on Silverlight 5. The site relies on the HTTPS protocol, but video content is being transmitted via HTTP. Therefore the "Mixed Content" dialog appears.</p>  <p>But when user starts to interact with this dialog (like moving it around) or tries to click on application area IE freezes:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/S3lHA.png"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/S3lHA.png" alt="enter image description here"></a> â€‹ And this very much upsets our users as they can not switch the setting "Display Mixed Content: Prompt".</p>  <p>Sometimes IE opens the "Mixed Content" popup in the background and users cannot understand at all what happens because they cannot access the application and then the browser crashes.</p>  <p>I cannot share link to the application, but the same issue appears at the following site: <a href="https://demos.telerik.com/silverlight/">https://demos.telerik.com/silverlight/</a></p>  <p>Also we created a test app without complex logic using pure SL 5. It just downloads a picture from HTTP host, then the "Mixed Content" dialog appears, and then when users taps to app area or try to move dialog, IE hangs.</p>  <p>So, the questions are:</p>  <ol> <li>Is this a known native bug of IE or Silverlight and it is impossible to fix or workaround?</li> <li>Otherwise, how we can fix this issue in our app?</li> </ol>
