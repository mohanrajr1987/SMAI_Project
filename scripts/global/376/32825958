<p>Has anyone used HtmlPage.Window.Eval( "window.print()" ); to print pages in Silverlight 5.I understand that Silverlight has its own PrintDocument class and support for printing technologies.  But since our clients upgraded from using HtmlPage.Window.Eval( "window.print()" ); to silverlight 5's print document, they have been having issues with printing and is not usable. I am planning to still keep the version of Silverlight 5 but use HtmlPage.Window.Eval( "window.print()" ) for printing. We use IE 10. It does not need to work on other browsers.</p>  <p>Can anyone recommend some good videos or tutorials about HtmlPage.Window.Eval( "window.print()" ).Currently it is printing blank pages for me. What should I look for?  Is there something in the silverlight.js which tells it to print? There is css file but all it has is some fonts. Can someone help me with why the first report wraps. It is cutting off the width of the report after a certain width Is it the width of the report or the font</p>  <p>This is the problem I am having:  Scrre HtmlPage.Window.Eval( "window.print()" ) does not keep the format <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ev4YH.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ev4YH.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>See screenshot: printDocument  <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/4gM6g.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/4gM6g.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>See how both of the are so different. One uses HtmlPage.Window.Eval( "window.print()" ) and the other uses PrintDocument</p>  <p>These are the code details for Eval method.</p>  <pre><code> private HtmlDocument        m_HtmlDoc;             private HtmlElement         m_PrintReport;             private HtmlElement         m_Div;             private HtmlElement         m_Table;             private HtmlElement         m_TR;             private HtmlElement         m_TD;   this.m_HtmlDoc = HtmlPage.Document; this.m_PrintReport = this.m_HtmlDoc.GetElementById( "printReport" );      HtmlPage.Window.Eval( "window.print()" ); </code></pre>  <p> Report Viewer      </p>  <p>        body {     background:#ffffff;     color:#000000;     font-family: rvConsolas; }</p>  <p>@font-face {     font-family: rvConsolas;     font-style: normal;     font-weight: normal;     src: url(EmConsola.eot); }</p>  <h1>rptViewer</h1>  <p>{     display: none;     visibility: hidden; }</p>  <h1>printReport</h1>  <p>{     visibility: visible;     font-family: rvConsolas;     overflow: hidden; }</p>  <p>td  {     font-family: rvConsolas;     overflow: hidden;     font-size: 52%; }</p>  <h1>Page</h1>  <p>{     page-break-after: always }</p>
