<p>I have this code here to use the phone dialer to make a simple phone call:</p>  <pre><code> private void buttonMakeCall_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)     {         PhoneCallTask phoneCallTask = new PhoneCallTask();         string number = textBoxCal.Text;         phoneCallTask.PhoneNumber = number;         phoneCallTask.Show();     } </code></pre>  <p>When I tap the button, the app shows me the dialerâ€”but at the same time I get an exception, from I don't know where.</p>  <p>I've alredy tried to put the code in a <em>try-catch</em> ; but, I still always get the exception (the capability I activated).</p>  <p>The exception is this:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>$exception    {"Type   'System.Runtime.InteropServices.WindowsRuntime.RuntimeClass' cannot be   serialized. Consider marking it with the DataContractAttribute   attribute, and marking all of its members you want serialized with the   DataMemberAttribute attribute. Alternatively, you can ensure that the   type is public and has a parameterless constructor - all public   members of the type will then be serialized, and no attributes will be   required."} <code>System.Runtime.Serialization.InvalidDataContractException</code></p> </blockquote>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong>  Update: I get the exception only after the login (with HTTPClient), on the login page i don't get the exception, really don't what to do, maybe i caused by the connection that is stil on ?</p>
