<p>I have CWE application for Lync which is build on Silver light. It was working fine All Lync versions from 15.0.4454.1509. </p>  <p>Two weeks back one issue reported like Application stuck on 100% Loading animation(Silverlight object Loading). Its came to know that  this happened on Skype For Business and the version of the same is as "15.0.4745.1000". </p>  <p>After digging into this issue I understood that this issue came after the office 365 Update called  "KB3054946".</p>  <p>Before, I got the same issue for Lync version and I fixed the same by adding the websites to trusted application using registry key, By using the registry entry something like this "Office\Lync\Security\Trusted Sites\http". </p>  <p>So I hope this entry is not valid for SFB.(I don't know is it because of any other issues.)</p>  <p>So is there any way to fix this issue for SFB.</p>
