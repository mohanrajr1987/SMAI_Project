<p>I am working in Silverlight using ASP.NET MVC. I have a number of pages that use the same methods to send Json strings to a controller which processes them and stores them within the database. The same code is used over and over again for different strings and it works fine. However one page in particular after using  UploadStringAsync will not hit the controller. I do not need to post code as I know it is fine, my question really is has anyone else come across this before?</p>
