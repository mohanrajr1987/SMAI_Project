<p>My goal is to mix 2 audio files that is one voice and one background music. For mixing I am using NAudio. The problem is I am getting following exception while reading mp3 file using NAudio's <code>Mp3FileReader</code>.</p>  <pre><code>DllImport cannot be used on user-defined methods </code></pre>  <p>I am using NAudio in Windows Phone 8.1 Silverlight app project. I am not sure if NAudio is useable on WP Silverlight app if its useable then please help by providing a code example or suggest any other library or custom implementation to mix 2 audio files.</p>
