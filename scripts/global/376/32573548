<p>I have implemented LocalMessageReceiver as mentioned in this artice to handle multiple instances of my application.(<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd833063(v=VS.95).aspx" rel="nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd833063(v=VS.95).aspx</a>)  It worked fine and Im able detect multiple receivers. But I see a problem - even though I implicitly call "Dispose" on the localmessagereceiver, it is still alive and keeps listening (till I close the browser). Am I missing something? Can someone suggest how to Dispose the receiver and kill it after Im done working with it?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
