<p>We need to create an application that can be used via the browser but that can also be used while offline.</p>  <p>The browser Version will be used by our customer to do calculations. Each customer needs to log into the application with a username and Password.  The offline version will be used by our own employees. They need to be able to use this Version while not connected to a Network. The data that is needed for the application will be stored in XML files.</p>  <p>We are mainly programming with C# and the .NET-Framework. We thought about using WPF for the client version.  I have read that you can use Silverlight or XBAP to create a browser Version of the WPF application. AFAIK Silverlight is a dying Technology. How about XBAP? Would you still invest into this Technology? </p>  <p>The other solution would be to create two front end applications: The WPF application as an offline application and a web application (e.g. ASP.NET MVC) as a web application. Thought, this would mean that we would have to create two frontends (more work).</p>  <p>Is there another alternative?  Would it be better to create an HTML/JavaScript application (e.g. with AngularJ or something similar)?</p>
