<p>We use DevForce 2012 (latest) with Silverlight for data access. Today I noticed issue with one of the queries generated by EF(via DevForce)</p>  <p>Universal search adds predicates like so:</p>  <pre><code>predicates.Add(PredicateBuilder.Make(typeof(T), filterBoxRow.FieldName, FilterOperator.Contains, filterBoxRow.FilterFrom.ToString())); </code></pre>  <p>And it translates to query like this:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT * FROM Address WHERE ( CAST(CHARINDEX(LOWER(N'1124'), LOWER([Address1])) AS int))  </code></pre>  <p>Great, but not really. It puts criteria as "N" or Unicode. But this field (Address1) is VarChar(100) and because SQL Server has to do type conversion it runs 16 seconds instead of 1-2 seconds.</p>  <p>So, I found couple posts on how to do fix and force it in code first scenario. But not sure if DevForce supports this somehow for our schema first scenario? On model itself this field agrees with our database Unicode=NO and Type=VarChar</p>
