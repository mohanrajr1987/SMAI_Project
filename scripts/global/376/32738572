<p>I just made a custom control to <a href="https://github.com/Kinnara/WPToolkit" rel="nofollow">Kinnara windows phone toolkit</a>. (as fork for myself) I made a control named FlipBox what is a specified FlipView control. The control works fine in the Kinnara toolkit simple application (i use it as project referece), but after i made a libary(dll) i can not use the control.  I just added the libary as a dll referece to the project, and every original control work fine from the Kinnara project but mine does not. The intellisense can see my control, i can set up properties of the control, but after the deploy in runtime i got the following error:</p>  <p>Additional information: The type 'FlipBox' was not found. [Line: 184 Position: 41]</p>  <p>The InnerException is null.</p>  <p>Thanks for help.</p>
