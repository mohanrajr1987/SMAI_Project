<p>I am working on Silverlight 5.0 app. Because I am rendering a lot of models at once (hundreds of them) I would like to use geometry instancing. Unfortunatelly from my research i found out that silverlight uses shader model 2.0. Is it possible to perform instancing then? In xna 4.0 there is method</p>  <p><code>GraphicsDevice.DrawInstancedPrimitives()</code></p>  <p>Although I can' t see it in Silverlight. <strong>Is it possibly to use hardware instancing in Silverlight?</strong></p>  <p>If not  - are there some alternatives to increase performance of my app? The problem is that, I am calling <code>graphicsDevice.SetPixelShader()</code> and <code>graphicsDevice.SetVertexShader()</code> few thousands time in my <code>Draw()</code> method.</p>
