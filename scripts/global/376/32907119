<p>I have a Silverlight business application that supports different languages based on the user preference. This works perfectly on Windows but not entirely on Mac OS X. When the user logs on to the application the following code run:</p>  <pre><code>private static void SetCulture(string languageCode) {     CultureInfo newCultureInfo = new CultureInfo(languageCode);     Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture = newCultureInfo;     Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture = newCultureInfo; } </code></pre>  <p>It works with [en-US] and [sv-SE], but not with [nb-NO] or [nb] or [no].</p>  <p>I put some logging into the SetCulture function and I can see on the Mac that the CultureInfo is created and it shows "norsk bokm√•l", which is correct. But, when using the application it seems like the resource manager don't find the right assembly and falls back on neutral language which is set to en-US.</p>  <p>Anyone have some experience with this?</p>
