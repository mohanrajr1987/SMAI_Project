<p>I updated Silverlight because IE was continuously bugging me to update it to new version. And so I did. But after doing it my silvelright application gives me this message:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/lyvRD.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/lyvRD.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>When I click this link and try to install Silverlight Developer runtime, it says its already installed. What do I do now?</p>
