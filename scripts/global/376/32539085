<p>After updating a Silverlight project from Blend 4 (Silverlight 4) to Blend for Visual Studio 2013 (silverlight 5) blend is very slow. E.x. takes it 5 seconds to select an element in an view. I have 1000 behaviours in the project. By reducing this amount to the amount of behaviours used in one view (10 behaviours) blend seems OK responding. There is no problem in visual studio 2013. For me it seems that blend by selecting anything rescans all files in the solution? Any solution? </p>
