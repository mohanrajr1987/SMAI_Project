<p>I'm working on a legacy application that's written using Silverlight 5, The application contains lot's of anti-patterns and bad practices. I'm responsible for adding real-time interactions (such as notification) using SingalR.<br> By the way, They're using <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.servicemodel.domainservices.client.applicationservices(v=vs.91).aspx" rel="nofollow">these</a> WCF RIA Services for interacting with authentication.  </p>  <p>They have a Main page, this page is the place where I'm getting user's notification and show them for logged in users:</p>  <pre><code>public partial class MainPage : UserControl {     public MainPage()     {        InitializeComponent();        //...      } } </code></pre>  <p>So as you can see I didn't set DataContext property as long as user is logged in, I need to set MainPage's DataContext after a user logs in to application, So I have to do that in <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.servicemodel.domainservices.client.operationbase.completed(v=vs.91).aspx" rel="nofollow">LoginOperation_Completed</a> inside <code>LoginForm</code> page:</p>  <pre><code>public partial class LoginForm : StackPanel {    private LoginRegistrationWindow parentWindow;    private LoginInfo loginInfo = new LoginInfo();    public LoginForm()    {        InitializeComponent();        //...    }     private void LoginOperation_Completed(LoginOperation loginOperation)    {      if (loginOperation.LoginSuccess)     {             // Here I need to access MainPages's DataContext property and set it with my ViewModel     }    } } </code></pre>  <p>Now my question is that, how can I set MainPage's DataContext property inside another class (in this case <code>LoginFrom</code>)?</p>  <p>I have also tried to give an ID to my MainPage user control and access it like this:</p>  <pre><code>mainPage.DataContext = new NotificationItemViewModel(); </code></pre>  <p>But the compiler gives me this error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The name 'mainPage' does not exist in the current context</p> </blockquote>
