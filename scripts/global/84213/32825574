<p>I have 2 collectionViewController, each filled with cells with images where I can scroll through horizontally. Both are nested on a navigationViewController.</p>  <p>Now, if I push a button, one controller shall switch to another with push:</p>  <pre><code>[myNavController pushViewController:collectionViewController1 animated:YES]; </code></pre>  <p>How can I change the animation so the collectionViewController doesn't appear from the side, so that it comes in from the top/bottom?</p>  <p>Thanks for the help!</p>
