<p>I've created a <code>UICollectionView</code> with an image in each cell. I'm wondering how I can make a trigger action which will make the image fullscreen like in facebook, intagram or other apps. What is the best way in Swift to achieve this?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/znWoU.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/znWoU.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
