<p>With the recent release of iOS 9, there may need to be some updates to existing code to compensate for any changes made to apples API. Recently it seems they have made it so that collection views now automatically adjust it's content inset when a keyboard appears. This is useful for people who aren't handling it manually and or supporting multiple OS versions. In my application it's caused a bit of a headache. I finally came up with a solution using KVO to inform me when the system changes the insets and i react accordingly, it all works fine, with the exception of a single edge case.</p>  <p>If i show the keyboard and then attempt to go back in the navigation stack via an interactive swipe causing <code>beginAppearanceTransition:animated:</code> to be called, but then cancel it and then tap out side the keyboard to resign the first responder, the system all of a sudden decides it does not want to automatically update my insets and my KVO never get's triggered for the content inset, the keyboard goes away but the content inset is not reduced causing it too look wrong...if however i tap on the textfield causing the keyboard to show again, all of a sudden it decides to do it's automatic updating again.</p>  <p>Does anyone have anyone have any idea as to why it ignores my first dismissal of the keyboard after cancelling a interactive transition for updating my insets?</p>
