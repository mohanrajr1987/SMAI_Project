<p>I'm using Parse as a backend and loading items into a UICollectionView. Everything works great but I can't seem to properly delete certain ranges of items. Here's my delete function:</p>  <pre><code>func deleteButtonTapped() {   let indexPaths = collectionView!.indexPathsForSelectedItems()!    self.collectionView!.performBatchUpdates({     for index in indexPaths {       self.tasks[index.item].deleteInBackground()       self.tasks.removeAtIndex(index.item)     }   }, completion: nil)    self.collectionView!.deleteItemsAtIndexPaths(indexPaths) } </code></pre>  <p>I get the error: fatal error: Array index out of range I think this is because as the for loop cycles it loses an item but maintains the original count. I checked to make sure self.tasks and indexPaths returns what I expect. Not sure what else to try. How can I refactor this? Any help or direction would be much appreciated. Thanks!</p>
