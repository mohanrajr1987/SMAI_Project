<p>I'm having a difficult time figuring out how to designing what feels like it should be a fairly straightforward layout for my collection view. The heights of each cell are equal. The widths vary. The inter-item spacing should <strong>always</strong> be equal. The distance between rows should also always be equal. As more items are added, the width of the collection view will increase "intelligently." Let me give an example. </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/7qOzM.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/7qOzM.png" alt="Desired layout"></a></p>  <p>When I insert a new item, I will calculate the movement of items from rows (maybe the first item of row 1 moves up to row 0, maybe the first item of row 2 moves up to row 1. I then move it and the collection view grows wider. </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/7MmMi.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/7MmMi.png" alt="Colors added for illustrative purposes"></a></p>  <p>I feel like this should be reasonably straightforward but I'm struggling.  Does anyone have some sample code that could help? </p>
