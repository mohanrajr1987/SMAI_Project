<p>I'm trying to add a UICollectionView to my view to use as a scrolling date picker on a single line. I'd like this to be relatively compact, but I'm having trouble when setting the collection view's height in IB. </p>  <p>Basically if I drop the height of the frame below 114, my prototype cells disappear, and no cells are displayed when I run the app. As long as it's above that value, everything works fine. </p>  <p>I've also got a black bar of empty background space above the cells despite setting their height to the same as the frame's height in sizeForItemAtIndexPath. </p>  <p>My delegate and datasource are set up correctly, and my cell has an identifier set and is being dequeued just fine, as long as the view's height is large enough. Do I need to subclass UICollectionViewLayout to get a really short view to work?</p>
