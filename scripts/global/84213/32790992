<p>I have a UICollectionViewController that I want to take orders for products.  Each custom collectionViewCell has a UIStepper to take the quantity for each product the user wishes to order.  Every time the value of the stepper changes, the price of the product is multiplied by the quantity and the total for that product calculated.</p>  <p>How would I go about passing this information back to the UICollectionViewController from each individual cell to calculate the overall total?</p>  <p>I was originally updating the controllers <code>total</code> property from <code>cellForRowAtIndexPath</code> but realised that obviously doesn't update every time a stepper's value is changed.</p>
