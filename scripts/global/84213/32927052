<p>So I have a UICollectionView that I want to use to display multiple UICollectionViewCells and different headers depending on the state the user is in. The problem is I can't seem to register multiple UICollectionResuableView (header) views within the storyboard. If I try to register one as a footer and use it as a header the app crashes. I also do not see anywhere in the storyboard to declare the number of sections, which would alleviate the problem. For now I'm having to use multiple UICollectionViews and hide/unhide the collectionview I want to display based on the header I need. Is there a better way to do this, or a way to register multiple header views in the same UICollectionView within the storyboard?</p>
