<p>Can anyone give me a run down on how to implement JSQMessagesViewController in swift for my app. I've took a look at the demo and still can't quite figure out how to get the collectionview and fake messages to show up in my own project. I have no idea where to start with this and I have looked at their documentation. Sorry i'm a noob.</p>
