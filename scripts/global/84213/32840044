<p>I have a <code>UICollectionView</code> and I want to create a custom <code>UICollectionViewFlowLayout</code> to it that will be just like in the picture, but I just can't do it.</p>  <p>The final result should be: There are sections and in each section there are few cells, no more then the <code>UICollectionView</code> width, I want each section to be vertically aligned to the previous section, but if the section is at the end of the <code>UICollectionView</code> and out of the bounds of the collection, I want it to draw in a new line, just as in the photo.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Mhx3x.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Mhx3x.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I've checked <strong>mokagio</strong> <a href="https://github.com/mokagio/UICollectionViewLeftAlignedLayout" rel="nofollow">UICollectionViewLeftAlignedLayout</a>, it looks the same except the part of the sections, the cells horizontally aligned and each cells is kept in the bounds of the <code>UICollectionView</code>, the problem is when I change the size of the items (cells), it's just as a normal layout and the sections are right after the other vertically.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/MfaVO.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/MfaVO.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>If I get that right, what I have to do is to set the <code>UICollectionViewFlowLayout</code> <code>scrollDirection</code> to <strong>Vertical</strong> and change the layout inside the section, because now the cells are horizontally aligned like that:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/XHsiu.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/XHsiu.png" alt="enter image description here"></a> </p>  <p>I need to vertically align the cells inside each section and change the frame of the section to fit the new cells bounds, am I right?</p>  <p>Please can someone guide me on how to start? I've watched Ray Wenderlich videos / tutorials, but still get can't the hang of it.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
