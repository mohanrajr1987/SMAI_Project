<p>I am working on calendar view, in which i am facing problem of scrolling in both way->horizontal and vertical.</p>  <p>I want to create date and time view calendar. In which on left to right scrolling all date will be coming and from top to bottom scrolling time will be shown. It will be rows and columns so in every date user can keep it event according to time. </p>  <p>Even i have kept my UICollectionView inside UIScrollView but scrolling is done in direction only either vertical or horizontal. But i want to scroll in both side. I have tried by keeping UICollectionView scrolling vertical and UIScrollView as horizontal and even changed both scrolling property but it don't work at all. It scrolling in one direction only. If i keep my UICollectionView as vertical then it will scroll vertical and if horizontal then it will scroll in horizontal way.</p>  <p>Is there a way to create it by customizing the collection view?</p>  <p>If there are any third party classes implemented, then also suggest. <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/PzrLt.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/PzrLt.png" alt="See Images below for my requirement"></a></p>
