<p>MyCollectionViewController subclasses <strong>UICollectionViewController</strong>, <strong>UICollectionViewDelegate</strong> and <strong>UICollectionViewDataSource</strong>. It worked just fine before I switched to Swift 2.0. Now I get the following error: "Redundant conformance of MyCollectionViewController to protocol UICollectionViewDataSource".</p>  <p>I checked the official UICollectionView Class Reference but it still states that I have to use both the Delegate and the Data Source. If I don't subclass the Delegate and the Data Source it seems that the app works. Is there anything in particular I should note? Or maybe some updated official documentation? </p>
