<p>So I have this issue where I have to load one entity on two collection views, and one table view. The thing is, primarily I just had to load one entity on the VC where the tableview is located. And that data entity has these parameters for i.e.:</p>  <ul> <li>Engine type (diesel or petrol)</li> <li>Car color</li> <li>Max.velocity</li> <li>Year of production</li> </ul>  <p>Now, the main point was, to color the cells on the tableview depending on the type of the car engine. So, if the data Entity "Car" has a Bool value of "isEngineDiesel" = true, then the cell would be orange, if false, then it would be light blue. And this worked just fine, a simple if statement on the table view delegate method for loading such cells. But, now I had to implement another VC which has two collection views, in which, the first one loads ONLY Diesel engine Car entity's, and the other Petrol  type.  So I guess the issue is already clear here. How can I accomplish this? Because after countless hours of experimenting the only idea I had was two make TWO entity's in which the one is DieselCar and the other PetrolCar. But that means changing the complete data structure, and also, instead of one table view I would actually need two, which doesn't seem like a good idea due the fact that it would "overflow" with all the data there is.</p>  <p>So...any ideas gents?</p>  <p>EDIT:</p>  <p>So far I've only managed to get the cell titles, but the return value of number of cells is still a mystery on how to solve. The Code for collection view delegate:</p>  <pre><code>func collectionView(collectionView: UICollectionView, cellForItemAtIndexPath indexPath: NSIndexPath) -&gt; UICollectionViewCell {      let cell = collectionView.dequeueReusableCellWithReuseIdentifier("cell", forIndexPath: indexPath) as! CollectionViewCell     if let carData = fetchedResultsController?.objectAtIndexPath(indexPath) as? Car {      cell.layer.cornerRadius = 20     cell.layer.masksToBounds = true           if collectionView == collectionViewDiesel {             if carData.isEngineDiesel == true {                 cell.backgroundColor = UIColor(netHex: 0x8DF060)                 // Display the cell name                  cell.cellTitle.text = carData.cellTitle             }         }else if collectionView == collectionViewPetrol {             if carData.isCarDiesel == false {                 cell.backgroundColor = UIColor(netHex: 0xEB9B2D)                 // Display the cell name                  cell.cellTitle.text = carData.cellTitle             }         }     }     return cell } </code></pre>  <p>And this is the method I need answered:</p>  <pre><code>func collectionView(collectionView: UICollectionView, numberOfItemsInSection section: Int) -&gt; Int {      return 5 } </code></pre>
