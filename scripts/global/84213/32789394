<p>So I have a dictionary data structure and it has names as key and age as value. What I would like to do is show this data in two columns - first one being names and the second one being age. It looks like this -</p>  <pre><code>Daniel  20  Jake 21 </code></pre>  <p>I have followed some tutorials that I found on web and what I managed to do so far is creating a collectionview (inside my main viewcontroller) displayed just names. I don't know how to go about diplaying name and age just like I want. How do I do that?</p>
