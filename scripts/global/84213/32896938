<p>As the title says, how should I load images from the web in my <code>UICollectionView</code>?</p>  <p>I want to load images from Instagram, but when there are more than 40 pictures (in 40 <code>UIImage</code> which are in 40 <code>UICollectionViewCell</code>) the scroll becomes really bad, slow, and the images appear and dissappear. Another problem is that they resize without reason, but that's other issue, maybe.</p>  <p>I tried with:</p>  <ul> <li>UIImage+AFNetworking</li> <li>UIImageView+WebCache (SDWebImage)</li> <li>Other custom loading methods, including async tasks.</li> </ul>  <p>I can't get a good scrolling, it really ruin the user experience. This is a new issue for me, because it worked perfectly until the last version of iOS 8.</p>  <p>Are there any <code>UICollectionView</code> libraries that I can use? Any fixes for these?</p>
