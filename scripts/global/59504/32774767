<p>The form submit is working fine in IE8, Mozilla and Chrome. But its not working properly in IE9, IE11. Its doesn't throw any error and when i click the submit button it remains on the same page. Action not happen. We tried many approach to solve the problem. </p>  <p>The code was developed 4 years ago using native javascript.</p>  <pre><code>// This is function triggers when i click submit button. function fnUpdateCase() {   document.global_form.node.value = "create_parent_case";    // submit the global form    document.global_form.submit();   } </code></pre>
