<p>Experiencing the "No valid message received from loaded iframe" error on an existing implementation while attempting to upload using IE9 and FineUploader 4.2.2, had <a href="/questions/29100133/fine-uploader-no-valid-message-received-from-loaded-iframe">similar issues with IE8</a> which related to my code not setting uuid correctly which was successfully resolved.</p>  <p>Those fixes are still in place; IE8 works and you can track the UUID from the post to the response (shown below) also FineUploader still works with IE8, IE11, Chrome &amp; Firefox.  Didn't have an IE10 reference point.</p>  <p>Can replicate the issue on IE9 v9.0.8112.16421 (stock Win7 IE9 VM from <a href="https://dev.modern.ie/tools/vms/windows/" rel="nofollow">Modern.ie</a>)</p>  <p>After selecting a file manually two requests are captured by the F12 developer tools - image is POSTed to my handler which returns a success response followed by a GET for "iframe.xss.response.js", which succeeds.</p>  <p>Turned on the debug setting in case it provided some more insight, sanitised results included below - stripped a few internal variables but otherwise unedited, headers were pasted from the F12 developer tools so may look a little strange.</p>  <p>Imagine I'm just missing something simple, but always a small chance it's a known issue fixed in a later release.</p>  <p><strong>Update 02/10</strong></p>  <p>Tested against FineUploader v5.3.2 and still experience the same error being logged by "registerPostMessageCallback" (line 5001, fine-uploader.js), placed a breakpoint inside "corsMessageReceiver.receiveMessage" which wasn't being reached.</p>  <p>Added some alerts to "iframe.xss.response.js" and the test for if (match) {...} is failing, but document.body.innerHTML definitely has content.</p>  <p><strong>Request</strong></p>  <pre><code>Request POST /Upload HTTP/1.1 Accept  text/html, application/xhtml+xml, */* Accept-Language en-GB User-Agent  Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/5.0) Content-Type    multipart/form-data; boundary=---------------------------7df14d340118 Accept-Encoding gzip, deflate Content-Length  781830 Connection  Keep-Alive Cache-Control   no-cache  -----------------------------7df14d340118 Content-Disposition: form-data; name="qquuid"  5489a37c-1cde-4c32-9faa-f9c2532b9ba1 -----------------------------7df14d340118 Content-Disposition: form-data; name="qqfilename"  Koala.jpg -----------------------------7df14d340118 Content-Disposition: form-data; name="qqfile"; filename="Koala.jpg" Content-Type: image/jpeg  &lt;Binary File Data Not Shown&gt; ---------------------------7df14d340118-- </code></pre>  <p><strong>Response</strong></p>  <pre><code>Response    HTTP/1.1 200 OK Cache-Control   private Content-Type    text/html; charset=utf-8 Server  Microsoft-IIS/7.5 Access-Control-Allow-Origin * Access-Control-Allow-Methods    GET,PUT,POST,DELETE,OPTIONS Access-Control-Allow-Headers    Content-Type, cache-control, x-requested-with Access-Control-Allow-Credentials    false Date    Fri, 25 Sep 2015 10:16:03 GMT Content-Length  268  {   "pageList": [],   "name": "Koala.jpg",   "newUuid": "2930",   "size": 762,   "thumbnailUrl": null,   "pageCount": 0,   "success": true,   "uuid": "5489a37c-1cde-4c32-9faa-f9c2532b9ba1" }&lt;script src="/js/fineuploader-4.2.2/iframe.xss.response.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; </code></pre>  <p><strong>Console</strong></p>  <pre><code>LOG: [FineUploader 4.2.2] Detected valid file button click event on file 'Koala.jpg', ID: 0.
