<pre><code>var body = dojo.create("html", {innerHTML: tmplStr}).children[1]; </code></pre>  <p>tmplStr is giving the needed html content. I want to set  it to html.innerHTML. Above code works fine in FireFox,GoogleChrome and IE10. But not working in IE8 and 9.Since innerHTML is read only in IE8 and 9, I'm not able to set the content in IE8 and 9. Please it would great if someone helps me in fixing this issue.</p>
