<p>I am using the Canvas theme from WooThemes on a WooCommerce shop. The shop is being used as a internal market in my clients intranet. Unfortunately the client uses IE9 with browser mode: IE9 and with quirks mode on. That is the default setup in the entire company and cannot be changed. </p>  <p>Unfortunately IE9 renders all products in one column despite the setting being for four columns. When I switch the browser mode in the dev console into IE9 compatibility mode it suddenly starts to work with 4 columns.</p>  <p>I need to find a server side setting (CSS, JS) for the Canvas them for getting this to work. Any ideas? </p>
