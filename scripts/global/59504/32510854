<p>I have this code below</p>  <pre><code>&lt;input type="file" id="ReplaceDocument"/&gt;  function replaceDoc(input) {        if (confirm('Please confirm that you wish to replace ' + filename)) {         $('#DocId').val(id);         $('#DocTypeId').val(docTypeInt);         $("#ReplaceDocument").click();     } };      $("#ReplaceDocument").change(function () {         doReplaceDoc();     }); function doReplaceDoc() {    //do something  } </code></pre>  <p>The first part fires when someone tries to replace a file which in turn calls the click event of the file element. I have a jquery change event linked to the file element.</p>  <p>The issue is that it does not fire the change event twice. It just works one time and then it does not fire the change event. This is happening just in IE9. All other browsers work just fine.</p>  <p>Can someone tell me if this is a known issue or suggest any fix for it.</p>
