<p>I have an OL3 Map containing a Tile Layer with an XYZ Source. In IE10+ and other Browsers (i.e. Chrome and Firefox) performance is great, but in IE9 it's really, really slow. I tried using DOM renderer instead of Canvas but that didn't help. According to the docs IE9 should be supported, so I'm a little stuck here. My Map construct is as follows:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;script&gt;     var _maxExtent = [-20000000.000000, -9500000.000000, 20000000.000000, 14500000.000000];     var map = new ol.Map({         layers: [             new ol.layer.Tile({                 extent: _maxExtent,                 source: new ol.source.XYZ({                     url: "http://myserver/map/z{z}/row{y}/{z}_{x}-{y}.jpg"                 })             })         ],         view: new ol.View({             center: [0, 2500000],             resolutions: [                39135.758475,                19567.8792375,                9783.93961875,                4891.969809375,                2445.9849046875,                1222.99245234375,                611.496226171875             ],             zoom: 0,             extent: _maxExtent         }),         target: document.getElementById("mymap")     }); &lt;/script&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Am I missing something? Is there a way to increase performance? Any help will be greatly appreciated.</p>  <p><strong>Edit:</strong> Turns out the issue was caused by the test machine running IE9 and not OpenLayers. Performance is good in a different environment.</p>
