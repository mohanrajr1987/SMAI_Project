<p>I've noticed that LinkedIn Javascript API authorization is not working in IE9. Code snippet is the following</p>  <pre><code>if (!IN.User.isAuthorized()) {     IN.User.authorize(getProfile); } else {     getProfile(); } </code></pre>  <p><code>getProfile()</code> callback method never called. After <code>IN.User.authorize()</code> call browser opens a popup window, tries to load some LinkedIn resource (my case  <a href="https://platform.linkedin.com/js/xdrpc.html?v=0.0.2000-RC8.50730-1428#" rel="nofollow">https://platform.linkedin.com/js/xdrpc.html?v=0.0.2000-RC8.50730-1428#</a>), and once loading is finished window remains blank with "Processing" text in the title.</p>  <p>In Chrome and Firefox all works ok. And If I correctly remember, this worked earlier (a couple months ago).</p>  <p>What could be the issue?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
