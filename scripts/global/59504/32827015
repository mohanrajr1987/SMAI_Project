<p>Some of my site users having problem when accessing via in Internet Explorer (my site supports only IE) . My website (<code>sub.example.com</code>) is developed using asp.net and it is the sub-domain of <code>example.com</code> and both where using different authentication. From <code>sub.example.com</code> i have a link to <code>example.com</code> as soon as user logged in to <code>example.com</code> then if they clicks any link in <code>sub.example.com</code> they started getting <code>"Internet Explorer cannot display the webpage"</code> error.</p>  <p>Once we reset the browser and disabled <code>“Enabled production mode”</code> check box then it started working fine. And only few users are experiencing this problem.</p>  <p>In developer mode network log, it is showing result as <code>“Aborted”</code> and is of HTTPS protocol. Browser uses <code>SSL 3.0</code> and <code>TLS 1.0</code>.</p>  <p>Does anyone know what is causing this issue?</p>
