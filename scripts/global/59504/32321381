<p>I've built a site using WordPress and Foundation 5. It renders well in modern browsers, but the client needs it to run in IE9. I'm testing it in IE9 using a Windows virtual machine running Windows 7 and the site is not loading the CSS completely or correctly, and only some of the rules are being recognized, usually the first instance of a rule and none of the succeeding instances.</p>  <p><strong>Things I've tried already</strong></p>  <ul> <li>I have a doctype declaration</li> <li>I've included <code>&lt;meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" /&gt;</code> first in my header</li> <li>Double checked for stray <code>console.log</code> in my jQuery</li> <li><s>I have fewer than 4096 selectors in my CSS</s></li> <li>I've tested with all plugins turned off and scripts removed</li> <li>I've fixed all the HTML validation errors I can</li> </ul>  <p>Staging site: <a href="http://sytycw.pixelsmithdesign.com" rel="nofollow">http://sytycw.pixelsmithdesign.com</a></p>  <p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>  <p>EDIT: As justbeez pointed out below I did have more than 4095 selectors, once I counted multiples.</p>
