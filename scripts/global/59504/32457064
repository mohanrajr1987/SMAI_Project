<p>In ie9 browser instead of the document mode Edge, it is getting changed to document mode ie8.</p>  <p>I know this is because of the Enterpise mode switched on. There any way to override to the Edge mode.</p>  <p>Because of this wrong rendering mode, some alignment issues are occurring, which I have to fix it.</p>  <p>In order to fix that, I need to detect If the rendered profile is <strong>Enterprise</strong> mode and <strong>Document type</strong> id ie8</p>  <p><strong>&lt; meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=Edge" /></strong></p>  <p>In all other browsers there is no issue.</p>
