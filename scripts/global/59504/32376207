<p>I'm running an issue where in IE9 my css will break if its chained and there is an invalid/not recognised psuedo class. Example:</p>  <p>My sass will compile to something like this: </p>  <pre><code>input.invalid,select.invalid,input:invalid,select:invalid { display: block} </code></pre>  <p>Above example will break in IE9 because :invalid is not recognised by IE9, therefor also the css is not applied to an input with a class invalid. The whole line will just be skipped.</p>  <p>If i separate those 2 from each other its fine, IE9 will skip the :invalid class but still read the first two like this:</p>  <pre><code>input:invalid,select:invalid { display: block} input.invalid,select.invalid { display: block} </code></pre>  <p>Is this a bug? </p>
