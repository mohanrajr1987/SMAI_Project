<p>I have built a site with MaterializeCSS. Everything is fine except that you can't  select text with the mouse when using IE9, with IE10 or better it's ok. </p>  <p>You can see this behaviour at <a href="http://materializecss.com/getting-started.html" rel="nofollow">http://materializecss.com/getting-started.html</a> , you can't select text with the mouse when using IE9. </p>  <p>How do I enable text selection using a mouse with IE9 when a site is built with MaterializeCSS ?</p>
