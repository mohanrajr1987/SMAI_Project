<p>I'm wrapping the CKEditor library as a GWT Widget, it works well until I used that widget for larger project, with more modules and components inside the application. GWT generated a lot of <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag, and it's problem with IE8 (also for IE9), it allows only 31 <code>style</code> tag on one page while CKEditor requires to add some more that element, and I got an error <code>Invalid Argument</code>.</p>  <p>I'm trying to fix that problem with IE8-9, and I'm thinking 2 solutions - Override the method <code>appendStyleText</code> defined by CKEditor, however I don't know how to do that way - Combine all <code>style</code> generated by GWT into only one</p>  <p>Anyone who had experience on that domain, please help to give your suggestion</p>
