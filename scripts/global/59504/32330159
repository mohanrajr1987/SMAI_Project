<p>I am developing an Ember CLI App. When I deploy my app it works in Chrome and IE9. But when I use "ember serve" for development and testing on localhost it is working in Chrome but nothing happens in IE9.</p>  <p>I don't even get any error messages. In console there's just an empty error. Under network, all is loading fine - except it is not making any requests to my REST adapter (which is likely because the app isn't even loading.)</p>  <p>Has anyone experienced this behaviour? Unfortunately right now I am not able to give more information on the error since I don't have any.</p>  <p>Versions: ember: 1.13.5 ember data: 1.13.7 jquery: 1.11.3</p>
