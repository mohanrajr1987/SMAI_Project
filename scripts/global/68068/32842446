<p>I am trying to display a set of questions on the application employee profile (ExtJS 4.2.3) screen, and the answers to these questions will be options (radio buttons say - Yes/No/NA). The issue I am facing is that I need to fetch these questions from the database, and populate these questions &amp; radio buttons dynamically.</p>  <p>Once the user selects the answers to these questions for a particular employee, we also need to save these questions (FK) and the answers to those questions against the employee.</p>  <p>A static representation would be as shown in image. I am new to ExtJS and facing issues to identify, which component (like a fieldcontainer) should I use, how to dynamically populate multiple values, and then while saving, how to pass these values back to the database.<a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/3rSGr.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/3rSGr.png" alt="Sample"></a></p>
