<p>I am trying to apply load mask before a for loop which will hide and show and do some manipulations based on some conditions. To do this it  is taking time , so I want to apply load mask before for loop starting and unmask after for loop execution.</p>  <p>I am doing like this.</p>  <pre><code>     Ext.getBody().mask('Loading.....');      for(var i=0;i&lt;someValue;i++){       //my code      }      Ext.getBody().unmask(); </code></pre>  <p>But masking is happening after the for loop execution.It is not starting before for loop.</p>  <p>could you please help me what's wrong with my code.</p>
