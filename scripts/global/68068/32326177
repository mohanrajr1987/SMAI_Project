<p>I need to change action column icon of a single row in paging grid on button click. It works fine when I am on the same page where the record(row) is located, say on page 1. But when I am on page 2 and tries to change the icon, nothing happens. Is there any way to do it ?</p>  <p>Thanks Kishor Koli</p>
