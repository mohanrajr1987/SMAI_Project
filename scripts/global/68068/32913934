<p>I have a store and i had a model attached to it, but i notice that either if my model is wrong (doesn't match json) or I remove my model completely from the store, it still works.</p>  <p>I would like to know what advantages / disadvantages this offers?</p>  <p>Why include models when they can be removed. I must admit i never saw any documentation stating the model can be excluded, but it seems to work.</p>  <p>Any ideas?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
