<p>I am trying to use the treepanel but I have received some data from an external api in the following format (see below), basically its a json array that will automatically return a array with companies (B &amp; A and T &amp; C below) and each company would have a number of employees as children.</p>  <p>I am unsure how to get this working in the treepanel. I need the company to be displayed as a row that can be expanded to show the children.</p>  <p>Does a standard store support this, is my data in the correct format. I am a little lost on this. Any help really appreciated</p>  <p>Thanks</p>  <pre><code>"B &amp; A": [   {     "name": "Fred",     "code": "aan9"   },   {     "name": "Walter",     "code": "wxxs"   } ], "T &amp; C": [     {     "name": "mary",     "code": "assan9"   },   {     "name": "Bart",     "code": "sswxxs"   } ] </code></pre>
