<p>I have placed the following and everything is working great, i have a grid on the left and a grid on the right, but they placed side by side, I wouldlike a thin line between thing, is this possible ?</p>  <pre><code>   {                         layout: {                             type: 'hbox',                             pack: 'start',                             align: 'stretch'                         },                         items: [                             {                                 xtype: 'first-grid-panel',                                 flex: 1                             },                             {                                 xtype: 'second-grid-panel',                                 flex: 1                             }                         ]                     } </code></pre>  <p>I was hoping to placer some kind of vertical line between them, very thin.</p>  <p>Or other option would be to place a right border on the "left" grid panel and a left border on the "right" grid panel. Unsure weather that would work.</p>  <p>I tried setting frame: true, but this puts a big ugly frame around it.</p>  <p>Any ideas?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
