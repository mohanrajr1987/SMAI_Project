<p>I'm working on some code, and I came across the following situation inside an archive .js --</p>  <pre><code>(function(Ext) { ..."Here have 2 Ext.Define"... })(Ext); </code></pre>  <p>This code runs normally, but i can't find because the declaration is like that, what is the difference of use simply 2 Ext.Define, the guy who did that code don't work here anymore, but my colleagues said that according to him this is more faster to render, this information proceeds? and if it is, what kind of situations i can use that?</p>
