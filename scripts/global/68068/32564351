<p>I'm new to ExtJS and I'm working on a address book in which admins can edit the users' address by pick the listed states and cities from two combobox.</p>  <p>I need to build some linkage comboboxes in grid panel so that after admin pick one state in the first drop-down, the relatives cities will be listed in the second drop-down automatically. </p>  <p>If it's only a simple panel I can update the cityStore after state been selected with following code:</p>  <pre><code>        {                                            xtype:"combo",                                                                                                name:'state',               id:'state',               displayField:'name',               valueField:'id',               store:storeState,               triggerAction:'all',               queryMode:'local',               selecOnFocus:true,               forceSelection:true,               allowBlank:false,               editable:true,             //using select listener for updating city store               listeners:{                   select:function(combo,record,index){                       try{                           var city = Ext.getCmp('city');                           city.clearValue();                           city.store.load(                                {                                    params:{                                        paramId:combo.getValue()                                    }                                }                              );                       }catch(ex){                           alert("Failed to load data");                       }                    }                   }            }, </code></pre>  <p>However in GridPanel if I update the cityStore with same way, the whole column will changed.  Is there anyway to only address the column in the same row in Grid panel? Thanks!</p>
