<p>Is this a valid model ? I doesn't seem to be working ? Maybe I have to use a HasOne, but the problem is that it has an association key and my data does not.</p>  <pre><code>    {name:'name', type: 'string'},     {name: 'desc', type: 'string', defaultValue: 'NA'},     {name:'item', fields: [         {name: 'name'},         {name: 'desc'},     ]} </code></pre>  <p>In the above i am using name Item with another array of fields. Maybe this isn't correct?  Is the above the right syntax ?</p>  <p>if I have to use HasOne association it appears that I need provide an association key but my data doesn't have an association key. Here is an example JSON record.</p>  <pre><code>{"name" : "test item", "desc" : "my temporary desc" "item" : [            { "name" : "item 1",              "desc" : "item 1 desc"            }           ]   } </code></pre>  <p>As you can see from the above, I have the main item "test item" and it arrives with 1 child, but the child has no association id i.e. child to parent. no hay id is present, its just a json complex object.</p>  <p>I am really struggling with this. Any ideas ?</p>  <p>I am using a rest proxy and and reader is 'son'</p>  <p>Any ideas ?</p>  <p>A little confused. HasOne does sound ideal BUT i have no relationship there.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
