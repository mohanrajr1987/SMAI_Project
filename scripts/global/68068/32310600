<p>I've got a model which has a field with a name property, for example:</p>  <pre><code>fields: [{         name: 'first',         type: 'string'     }] </code></pre>  <p>Now I've got a display field to show this field from the model, but I cant name it the same as in the model, which would look like this:</p>  <pre><code> {       xtype: 'displayfield',       name: 'first'  } </code></pre>  <p>Instead, I need the field to be named something like whats shown below (which is different from the name given in the model)</p>  <pre><code>     {           xtype: 'displayfield',           name: 'firstName'      } </code></pre>  <p>Now my question is, how can I do this keeping the name in the model and using a different name for the field?<p> I've done some research and found the 'mapping' property in <a href="http://www.objis.com/formationextjs/lib/extjs-4.0.0/docs/api/Ext.data.Field.html" rel="nofollow">Ext.data.field</a>:</p>  <pre><code>fields: [{         name: 'first',         type: 'string',         mapping: 'firstName'     }] </code></pre>  <p>But you need to give the nameProperty config the value 'mapping' <a href="http://www.objis.com/formationextjs/lib/extjs-4.0.0/docs/api/Ext.data.writer.Json.html" rel="nofollow">in the writer of the proxy</a>, and I'm not sure if this is what I'm looking for because I haven't managed to make it work (and I think the writer is for sending data back to the server).<br> So, can I specify the nameProperty somewhere else? Am I on the right path? Is there any other solution available? <p> Thank you very much.</p>
