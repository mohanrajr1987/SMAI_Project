<p>I am little confused with xtype and alias on a controller. Its my controller and I never added an xtype or alias. Is one created by default, I don't seem to find it on the controller instance.</p>  <p>From what i believe, although I could be wrong, that if i create an xtype then an alias is automatically assigned with a prefix of widget? Is this true also from alias creating and the xtype would be assigned less the widget prefix ?</p>  <p>the reason I ask is that I am doing getController inside another controller and I wanted to know if I could assign a ref using xtype under another controller.</p>  <p>Is this possible ? Or should I always call getController?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
