<p>Currently using ExtJS 4 and I am trying to use the controller for implementing all events but there are some events that i am handling in the Window itself which are the close and destroy events. I need to execute some code here.</p>  <p>Is this bad practice ? If the events happen in the Window (an instance of Ext.window.Window).</p>  <p>Should I but forwarding these events to the controller to handle ?</p>  <p>I am unsure the correct way of doing this but I presume I would have to get a reference to the controller from my "window" in it's event and then call fireEvent on the controller?</p>  <p>What is the best practice here?</p>  <p>I am using ExtJS 4.2 so no MVVM.</p>  <p>ExtJS seems to let me implement the events directly in "Components" but following the MVC pattern, is this not bad practice and everything should really pass through the controller.</p>  <p>Any help really appreciated</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
