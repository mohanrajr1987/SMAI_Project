<p>I have a JS function, when I give async as false it opens as new window, but when i give async as true its showing as pop up. I need to make the code as async as true, but it should open as new window, not as a pop up. Can you guys tell me how to make a asynchronous request so that the new window will not load as a popup?</p>  <pre><code>showNewWindow: function(menu) {             var me = this,              //             // Make a synchronous request so that the new window will             // not load as a popup.             //          },                                                                </code></pre>
