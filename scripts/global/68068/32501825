<p>I am trying to add a component to my window that has similar functionality to the grid but without all the selecting etc. It kind of seems overkill, I know you can disable grid selection etc but I was hoping for something similar.</p>  <p>Basically I have a store that has a field that contains a collection of text strings.</p>  <p>I would like to display the following info</p>  <pre><code>    Text Item Name: bcdef     Text Item Date:  25/04/2015 </code></pre>  <p>the name and date are in each record in the collection in the model. So I need to REPEAT over the above for 'n' number of records. I looked at the Dataview but it seems to support html templates not x-types?</p>  <p>resulting screen would be something like so</p>  <pre><code>    Text Item Name: bcdef     Text Item Date:  12/04/2015      Text Item Name: jtjrt     Text Item Date:  02/04/2015      Text Item Name: bcrjtrtjrtdef     Text Item Date:  04/04/2015      Text Item Name: bcdef     Text Item Date:  25/04/2015 </code></pre>  <p>Any ideas how to achieve this ?</p>  <p>The list doesn't need to be clickable, selectable or anything.. its just a list</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
