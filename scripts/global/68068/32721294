<p>I am loading my store and grid panel and assigning a filter like so</p>  <pre><code>myGrid.store.filter('enabled', 'true'); </code></pre>  <p>This is to filter out records that are not enabled. This works, my gridpanel initially shows all records that are enabled equal to true. Then when I apply a filter using the gridpanel header and search for a record that I know has enabled set to false NOW appears.</p>  <p>The initial gridpanel list after initially assigning store.filter(....) removes all records that don't have enabled equal to true but filtering with the header includes it in the new filter.</p>  <p>I followed the docs here : <a href="http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/4.2.2/#!/api/Ext.ux.grid.FiltersFeature" rel="nofollow">http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/4.2.2/#!/api/Ext.ux.grid.FiltersFeature</a></p>  <p>So I have something like this :</p>  <pre><code> Ext.apply(me, {         width: 500,         height: 250,         store: 'BlockItems',         features: [{             ftype: 'filters',             local: true, </code></pre>  <p>After removing the filter from the header I am left with my list again but now it includes records that <code>enabled != true</code> and also <code>enabled == true</code> i.e All records.</p>  <p>I am very confused. I have filtered my store, so why is the grid "header filter" no complying with the filter I initially added ?</p>  <p>Any help really appreciated</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
