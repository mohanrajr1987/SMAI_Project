<p>I have started extending a extjs application and I notice most of the views have a stateId, including Windows, GridPanels.</p>  <p>I would like to understand what these are, i presume they store some sort of state ? Where is this information stored ?  It seems to be client state so no session involved ?  I have checked the cookies and localStorage but I can't identify exactly where it is storing this information, how long the state lasts.</p>  <p>I tried searching the docs on this and couldn't find anything specific.</p>  <p>Maybe I am looking in the wrong place.</p>  <p>Any help would be really appreciated.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
