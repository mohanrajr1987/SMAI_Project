<p>I have a store and I need to add some headers to its proxy. I don't want to use defaultHeaders of the Ext.Ajax singleton as these are specific only to a few stores.</p>  <p>The headers use key / value pairs and the value comes from a variable that is NOT loaded when the store is initially loaded, the variable is populated after a successful login.</p>  <p>For this reason i couldn't use a constructor on the proxy or store as the variable I use for value of a header isn't available.</p>  <p>The only way I could get it to work was using the beforeLoad of store. Is this really the best way of achieving this ?</p>  <p>Heres my listener on my store, I am checking if undefined as its fired every single time.</p>  <pre><code>listeners: {     beforeload: function( store, operation, eOpts ) {         if (this.proxy.headers === undefined) {             this.proxy.headers = {                 'X-GType': CompA.Items.getGtype().get('type'), </code></pre>  <p>Anyone know a better way ?</p>  <p>There doesn't seem to be an event that fires only once.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
