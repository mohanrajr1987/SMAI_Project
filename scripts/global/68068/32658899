<p>One of the new requirement we have is to have a formula editor where user can enter some sort of formula (excel type) such as</p>  <pre><code>IF($Field1 &lt; 1000, 'Message 1') AND IF($Field2 &gt; 10000,'Message 2') </code></pre>  <p>so the idea here is that we should do auto suggestion (contextual) for "Function(IF)" , "Field(Field1 and Field2)","Condition (AND)" , "Operator (>)"  as user types in the textarea (so it not going to be Multiline).</p>  <p>so basically we are trying to mimic the same functionality what jira has where it does auto suggest for resolution, fixVersion etc like shown below <br>so far i ave tried <a href="https://www.sencha.com/forum/showthread.php?135922-How-to-add-auto-complete-to-textarea." rel="nofollow">this Sencha Forum</a> but with that i get behavior like multi select combo box which we dont want. <br> so my problems are <br> 1. Contextual Auto complete for textarea <br> 2. Syntax parsing for the formula to get the context. <br><br><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/CGN3u.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/CGN3u.png" alt="Jira&#39;s Contextual autosuggestion"></a> <br> and this <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/6uphC.gif" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/6uphC.gif" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>i really need help here, as google is not very helpful.</p>
