<p>I'm new to Azure App Services and I'm not getting the point about Azure API Apps access control. As I understood, the API Apps services has built in features to enable authentication on the API using Azure Active-Directory or third-party services.</p>  <p>In my case, I'm studying to use this with ASP.NET 5 REStful services capabilities. In that way, I'll usually need to authorize or not the access to some endpoint based on the claims a user might have, because in order to authorize or not something is a matter of business rules instead of a simple allow/deny based on login.</p>  <p>As I understood, Azure will just take care of authentication, it will redirect the client to the identity provider, will get the token and generate another token which will allow access to the API. But, how this connects with my app? Is it possible, working that way, to deal with claims for users? If so, how is this done?</p>  <p>I'm a little in doubt, because I'm failing to see how this really "connects" with my app, in the sense of allowing me to do what I'm already used to do.</p>
