<p>My data is in a SQL database and models are scaffolded, all works well on my machine. I deploy the web application to another machine, on that machine I also instantiate my SQL database. The web application launches fine until I try to login. On my local machine in my Web.config I see that the DefaultConnection is local and I believe this is where user identities, authentication etc. takes place. My DB entities are correctly accessed with another connection string. Ideally I'd like to move the ASP.NET user database to be alongside my model tables. I create the deployment as a file deployment as the target machine has no internet access.</p>
