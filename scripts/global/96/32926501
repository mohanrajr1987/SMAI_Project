<p>Has anyone successfully deployed an app using Breeze to Godaddy ASP.net hosting? If so, what's the secret? I've published the app, all the .dlls are where they should be yet I get the error message: "Error retreiving data.Metadata query failed for: breeze/Breeze/Metadata; An error has occurred." If this is not possible with Godaddy hosting, can anyone recommend a host that can accomodate Breeze?</p>
