<p>Our website scans from a thrid party tool for vulnerability. I am getting Slow HTTP post issue with my IIS. I am using IIS version 7.5</p>  <p>I set its content-length to 100 in the header section of request filtering and also set the maxAllowedlenght, maxQuerystring and maxUrl but still that Slow HTTP POST is coming in every scan.</p>  <p>So please help me out for reducing that time of the error or what is the setting for IIS or I will write code in my C#.</p>
