<p>I have tried many options and this is my last resort to see if any of the community members have any ideas.</p>  <p>I have .NET MVC 5 application in which I use a Filter to force HTTPS on each unsecured request.</p>  <p>Here is the scenario:</p>  <ol> <li>Access my application at say, <a href="http://portal.mywebsite.com" rel="nofollow">http://portal.mywebsite.com</a></li> <li>It is redirected to third party (auth0) SSO provider for authentication. If the user is not already authenticated, he is redirected to the SSO login page.</li> <li>The user enters valid credentials, authenticated.</li> </ol>  <p>The above scenario works perfectly. But the issue is If I access the same application with https say <a href="https://portal.mywebsite.com" rel="nofollow">https://portal.mywebsite.com</a>, it fails. To be precise, it fails to retrieve a ExternalIdentity (ExternalCookie) on the server.</p>  <pre><code>public async Task&lt;ActionResult&gt; ExternalLoginCallback(string returnUrl)     {         AuthenticationManager.SignOut(DefaultAuthenticationTypes.ExternalCookie);          var externalIdentity = await AuthenticationManager.GetExternalIdentityAsync(DefaultAuthenticationTypes.ExternalCookie);          if (externalIdentity == null)         {              throw(new Exception("Could not get the external identity. Please check your Auth0 configuration settings and ensure that " +                                 "you configured UseCookieAuthentication and UseExternalSignInCookie in the OWIN Startup class. " +                                 "Also make sure you are not calling setting the callbackOnLocationHash option on the JavaScript login widget."));          }          AuthenticationManager.SignIn(new AuthenticationProperties { IsPersistent = true }, CreateIdentity(externalIdentity));         return RedirectToLocal(returnUrl);     } </code></pre>  <p>Also, accessing the application with https on my test environment works and not the production environment.</p>  <p>All my web applications are hosted as Azure WebRoles. </p>  <p>I tried Fiddler to watch the requests between working and non-working to see if I can find any useful information in identifying the issue but no success.</p>  <p>Any thoughts or ideas that I could try to help me narrow down the cause?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
