<p>I'm totally new to filters in MVC and WebApi. Keeping in mind that using <code>DateTime.Now</code> is not always a good idea, I decided to use <code>DateTime.UtcNow</code> everywhere in the project. But I do want to add a timezone to every date, I heard that a great thing to do so is to use a custom action filter.</p>  <p>I searched a lot, but I didn't manage to understand how it is doable with this filters.</p>
