<p>I'm trying to build the web something like include a text box or text area, and a button.</p>  <p>When someone insert a lot of words into text box / text area, they can select some word and change the color to blue. </p>  <p>For example, when I insert "I am Kevin.",then I selected/highlighted "Kevin", when I click the button, the word "Kevin" will change to blue.</p>  <p>Besides, they will click the button to submit the text to database, the other web form will display this text using SQL selection query. The text "I am Kevin" can show on the page and "Kevin" can display with blue color.</p>  <p>How can I do that? Please help.</p>
