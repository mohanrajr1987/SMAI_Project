<p>I'm currently creating an ASP.NET MVC project, and my AJAX script is causing errors. I apologize for posting such a specific question, but I have honestly been stuck here for days.</p>  <pre><code> $.ajax({     url: "/Home/Update/",  //this calls a method in my controller to update the database.     data: JSON.stringify('{ "ToUpdate" : "1",  "ID" : "@variableWithinCode" }'),    type: "POST",    contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8",    dataType: "json",    cache: false,    error: function(jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown) {      alert(jqXHR.status);      alert(errorThrown);    },    success: function(response){       //code here never executes as error is always thrown.    } }); </code></pre>  <p>My Controller currently is of type ActionResult and returns the View.  However, I have also tried returning nothing (void) and returning a JsonResult.  Neither of these changes resulted in no errors.</p>  <p>Please could someone push me in the right direction, my Console has no errors.  Any help would be greatly, greatly appreciated.</p>
