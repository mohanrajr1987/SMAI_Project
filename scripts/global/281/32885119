<p>I'm using client-server mechanism inside my app to transport internal data. One of server parts should be designed to serve one request at time, no threads, no backlogs. I found weird functionality then using:</p>  <pre><code>serverport = new ServerSocket(port, 1, InetAddress.getLoopbackAddress()); </code></pre>  <p>This one continue to receive incoming connection even after one is already backlogged? Any suggestions how it's possible, and how may I workaround the issue?</p>
