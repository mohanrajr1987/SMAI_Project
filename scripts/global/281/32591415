<p>I'm trying to run <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/multithread.html" rel="nofollow">this sample</a> on an ARM-based training board. My OS configuration is OK &amp; there is no problem in single-thread mode, but when I want to try it in multi-threaded manner, <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/curl_easy_perform.html" rel="nofollow">curl_earsy_perform</a> always returns error 7 (CURLE_COULDNT_CONNECT).<br/> I re-checked whatever I thought may cause this error, but I couldn't resolve it. any idea?</p>
