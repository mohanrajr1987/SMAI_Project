<p><strong>So I have learned how to create a connection between AutoCAD and my SQL Server using the 'DBCONNECT MANAGER' tool within AutoCAD.</strong></p>  <p>My next goal is to try and change the value/text of an existing label I have created in AutoCAD through an SQL update.</p>  <p>I am fairly experienced in SQL but I am very new to AutoCAD and the whole SQL-AutoCAD integration process in general.</p>  <p>I am setting up this question to ask if someone could point me the right way to achieving this SQL update.</p>  <p>Ultimately I want to be able to change the value of the label that is inside my AutoCAD project save from SQL.</p>  <p>Any advice/help/links/tutorials on this type of stuff would be extremely helpful as I have found very little on the web about this.</p>  <p>Thank you in Advance.</p>
