<p>I'm running Xubuntu 15.04 and have been building Android for several months. I recently got into using Gerrit to cherry pick and review code. I have been working with <code>review.blissroms.com</code>. Everything has been just fine up until a couple days ago when I set up my ssh keys. Then the other day I tried to connect to the site but could not. The connection times out everytime. I have pinged the site as well and recieved <pre>0 packets received, 100% packet loss</pre> I ran <code>nc review.blissroms.com 29418</code> and got nothing at all. Then I tried to open it in 3 different browsers and I can't even open in browsers, they say: can not connect, it times out.  I can connect to the site from other computers though, without problem, and I can ssh and connect to other Gerrit sites, like <code>review.slimroms.org</code>.</p>  <p>How can I connect to <code>review.blissroms.com</code>?</p>
