<p>I'm using Bootstrap datepicker and it's supposed to grab information about the date from my database when I change the date.</p>  <p>Right now I'm having my jQuery script in jquery call a PHP function with my database query. My question is, though, should I include my PDO connection string in the function or at the top of the site the datepicker is on?</p>  <p>I just started wondering, if I included it in the function, it would create a new PDO connection object on every date change I suppose. I know that an object last till the object is destroyed, but are there no issues leaving it open through the entire page?</p>
