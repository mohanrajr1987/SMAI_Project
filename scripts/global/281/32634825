<p>I have been connecting with SQL Server without any problems until today. When I tried to connect SQL Server I get the following error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>TITLE: Connect to Server</p>      <p>Cannot connect to ASD-PC\SQLEXPRESS.</p>      <p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:</p>      <p>A network-related or instance-specific error occurred while establishing a connection to SQL Server. The server was not found or was not accessible. Verify that the instance name is correct and that SQL Server is configured to allow remote connections. (provider: SQL Network Interfaces, error: 26 - Error Locating Server/Instance Specified) (Microsoft SQL Server, Error: -1)</p> </blockquote>  <p>I have tried all that have been said in previous posts in this site but none of them worked.</p>
