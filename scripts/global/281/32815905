<p>I'm having a problem in regards to establishing a serial connection using Code Blocks. I already have a program that functions in Eclipse that allows me to both read and write via a serial connection, but I plan on creating a GUI to interact using said connection. </p>  <pre><code>int fd = open("dev/ttyS0", O_RDWR | O_NOCTTY | O_NDELAY); if (fd == -1) {     puts("No valid connection"); } </code></pre>  <p>So this works within Eclipse, but not my Code Blocks code. If I'm doing this the complete wrong way any suggestions are helpful, but I find that I'm fairly novice at coding. </p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
