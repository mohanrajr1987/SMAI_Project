<p>Ok, so - I have been reading a hundred articles trying to get my WMI call to run to a remote computer using Windows8 home version. I have tired almost every suggestion I have came across, yet I am still getting Access Denied.</p>  <p>Then, I came across some articles stating that the basic version of Windows (typically called the 'Home' version will not allow this).</p>  <p>I am spinning my wheels here and just need to know (since I cannot find anything telling me straight up) if a remote WMI call will work to a basic version of Windows.</p>  <p>I have also attempted to run the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer to the same PC (of course, ensuring the proper services are running and turning off both my 3rd party firewall as well as the Micorsoft firewall), however, I can get nothing to work when hitting my PC with the basic version of MS Win8.</p>  <p>Does anyone know if this is even possible? If so, any other suggestions...</p>  <p>Thanks in advance, KS</p>
