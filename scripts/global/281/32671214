<p>I have gone through several blogs and could not find an answer. Please help mates.</p>  <p>In every discussion I see that creating a connection object again and again is very costly? how? This is my main question. What are the disadvantages.  </p>  <p>For instance, I create a connection objects without pooling and after the object is used I delete it. So obj gets created and deleted and this reduces overhead. Please help. </p>
