<p>I have created a hbase scan method, but I am creating and closing the Connection inside the method itself. Could anyone suggest how to create a common connection, so that I can use the connection for a put, etc  I was not sure when to close the connection.</p>  <p>public class HBaseConnection {</p>  <pre><code>private static  Connection connection;  public void scanHBase(String tableName, byte[] startRow, byte[] stopRow) throws IOException {     connection = ConnectionFactory.createConnection(hBaseConn);     Table tableRef = connection.getTable(tableName);     Scan scan = new Scan(startRow, stopRow);     ResultScanner scanner = tableRef.getScanner(scan);     System.out.println("Starting scan");     for (Result res : scanner) {        //do something     }     scanner.close();     tableRef.close();     connection.close(); } </code></pre>  <p>}</p>  <p>The Connection object that I created inside the scanHBase() I need to create it outside as well as close it outside. Is there a possibility for this. I am new to Java and new to Hbase as </p>
