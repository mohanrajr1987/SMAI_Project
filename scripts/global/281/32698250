<p>I have an excel file that runs through R, but it has formulas that R doesn't read properly, to get the actual values into R I need to open up the file physically and save and close it.</p>  <p>I was looking for a command that can do this automatically in R for me. It would be better if the file was taken from the folder it is in, not the data thats in R already.</p>  <p>Sorry if this is very broad; I was looking at Functions to Manipulate Connections to try and see if I can open and close it that way.</p>  <p>R data -> Excel file</p>  <p>Code to load data:</p>  <pre><code>require(XLConnect) require(xlsx) dir &lt;- "..." setwd(dir) wb &lt;- loadWorkbook("Templates/WorkBookWithFormulas.xlsx", create=F) nws &lt;- read.xlsx(file="DataSheet.xlsx', sheetName="Results", header=FALSE, keepFormulas=TRUE) writeWorksheet( wb,  nws, sheet ="Paste Raw Data Here" , startRow = 1, startCol = 1, header = F) setForceFormulaRecalculation(wb, sheet = "Formula Page", T) saveWorkbook(wb, "NewdataPCR.xlsx") </code></pre>  <p>Now if you look at the NewdataPCR.xlsx you see the numbers go in there, however if you dont open and save the file and try to:</p>  <pre><code>newdata &lt;- read.xlsx(file="NewdataPCR.xlsx", sheetName="Formula Page", keepForumlas=T) </code></pre>  <p>When looking at the file in R you will see that the values come out to be FALSE instead, however if you just simply open the file, save, and close it the numerical values come out fine.</p>  <p>Can I force open the file using the commands:</p>  <pre><code>open(NewdataPCR.xlsx) save(NewdataPCR.xlsx) close(NewdataPCR.xlsx) </code></pre>  <p>Or is there a better way of getting the values into R.</p>  <p>I've tried setForceFormulaRecalculation as you see above and it still doesnt give me the values, but once I open, save, and close the file, R can read those values.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/download/g36ch6ch3b1v9kq/blog.zip" rel="nofollow">Files to run with R Code</a></p>
