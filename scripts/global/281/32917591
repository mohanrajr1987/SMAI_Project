<p>So I have been learning how to use the raspberry pi for the last week and so I did download SSH PuTTY to get access to the Pi and everything worked great, I would use the terminal and access directories. Then I wanted to connect the pi to the internet so I bridged my windows 8.1 WiFi connection to my pi's connection via Ethernet USB adapter and when I did this, I got no internet connection or connection to the Pi in general, I even tried to ping to the pi via command prompt in windows to no avail. I know that I am using the right ip address and the lights at both the Ethernet ports are blinking like they did before I lost the ability to connect. Please help, I cannot find anything. </p>
