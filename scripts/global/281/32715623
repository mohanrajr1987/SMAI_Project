<p>I have a servlet, which will pick some info about site etc. Data which I take from website, should be saved in HBase. Problem is, that I run my servlet on local Tomcat 8 server and I can't get response from HBase. Previously (for testing crawler plugin and recommendation) I debugget my project remotely on NetBeans. Here's a link how I did it: <a href="https://netbeans.org/kb/docs/java/javase-embedded.html" rel="nofollow">Using Oracle Java SE Embedded Support in NetBeans IDE</a>. But seems that on servlet project that won't work. Later Tomcat will be installed on the cluster, it should help, but maybe there's an option, to deploy on local computer and normally connect to HBase (without having errors like <code>Could not locate executable null\bin\winutils.exe in the Hadoop binaries.</code>).</p>
