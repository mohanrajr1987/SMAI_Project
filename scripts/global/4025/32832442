<p>This is my first post, I can fill in further details if needed. </p>  <p>I am looking to get the xy position of the cursor when either Hour, Minute or Seconds are clicked. I am looking to use the positions for the stepper to act accordingly. The current code just responds with undefined. I am getting undefined because I am using extjs 4.2.2 </p>  <pre><code>      {         xtype: 'spinnerfield',         itemId: 'time',         name: 'intime',         width: 125,    listeners: {     mousemove: {         element: 'el',         fn: function(e){            var event = e.event;            console.log(event.clientX);             }     } },      step:1,      value:"11:11:21", </code></pre>
