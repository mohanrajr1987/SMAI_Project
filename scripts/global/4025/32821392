<p>I have managed to implement a treepanel and everything seems to be working. I have data like so ( see below). My fields I "name" which holds below things like "ItemA", "ProductA" which are nodes and the "Iron" which is a leaf and a property called "Available" which is true / false (boolean but represented as a string).</p>  <p>When clicking the sort column for the boolean, i sorts them but sorts then as whole. i.e. I would only want to sort the booleans in each group. Currently it sorts them as group of items it seems. SO the nodes under ItemB change order, not just the order of the boolean column. I hope this makes sense.</p>  <p>I have the column model set to this </p>  <pre><code>        sortType: Ext.data.SortTypes.asUCString </code></pre>  <p>I have also tried changing the property of "folderSort" between true and false in the treepanel but it makes no difference.</p>  <p>Any ideas?</p>  <p>Heres an example of my data to try and visualize it better.</p>  <pre><code> ItemA     ProductA        Iron        true   ItemB     Product123        House       true        Garage      false        Misc        false     Product1443        HouseF      true        NewItem     false </code></pre>
