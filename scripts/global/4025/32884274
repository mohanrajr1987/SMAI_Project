<p>The ExtJs grid i am working with has around 30 columns. It is editable(using rowediting plugin). When the editor window is opened for edit, and the user scrolls horizontally to the right/left extremes, the buttons(Update/Cancel) are out of view. And we have to scroll back to click on Update/Cancel.</p>  <p>Any way we can have the button to move along with the horizontal scroll? </p>  <p>Any suggestions appreciated! Thanks!</p>
