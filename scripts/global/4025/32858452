<p>We are using EXT-JS 3.x. To select records from pages, used the method selectRecords(). Now, I can select records when I navigate the pages. But the problem is, on clicking the submit button all the selected records across pages should be visible. But below line of code    <code>grid.getSelectionModel().getSelections()</code> returns the selected records in the current page. Whether there are any options available to get all the selected records?</p>
