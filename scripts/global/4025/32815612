<p>I have a list of forms in a contianer. I just want to query all forms where value of any fields in the form starts with my passed value.</p>  <pre><code>mainContainer.query('form &gt; field[value^=Account]'); </code></pre>  <p>it is working fine and retrieving all the fields which starts with Account. But it is matching exact case. I Just want to ignore the case and all the fields even if the value is in lower case. </p>
