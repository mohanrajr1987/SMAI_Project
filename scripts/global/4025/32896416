<p>I have a render function on a grid column that basically returns some html, the html consists of a  tag to display an icon and then some text. Sort of like this</p>  <pre><code> &lt;i class="some class"&gt; &lt;/i&gt; some text </code></pre>  <p>I only want to attach a click event to the i tag, not the text, so itemClick wouldn't work. How do I attach ane element listener just to the i tag that is returned from my render function ?</p>  <p>A little lost ? Any ideas?</p>  <p>I did look at use a columnaction but i can only use an img, and no text can be set after the image.</p>  <p>Any ideas ?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
