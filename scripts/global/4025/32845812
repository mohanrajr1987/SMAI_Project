<p>I have a grid with data. When I select a row and hit the 'edit' button on the tbar, I want to view a window (including a form) with the data from the selected row. Fiddle: <a href="https://fiddle.sencha.com/#fiddle/ukp" rel="nofollow">https://fiddle.sencha.com/#fiddle/ukp</a></p>  <p>But I don't know how to access the current selected row or how to pass data from one controller to another (GridController --> WindowController).</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
