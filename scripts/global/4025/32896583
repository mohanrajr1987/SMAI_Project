<p>I need to import the following into a store but I am confused about the correct model or models I need to create.</p>  <p>here is an example of the JSON that is returned from my server. Basically its an array with 2 items, with an array in each. The field names are different in each.</p>  <p>I suspect I need to have more than one model and have a relationship but I am unsure where to start. Any ideas? Thanks</p>  <pre><code>[     firstItems: [     {         name : "ProductA",         key: "XYXZ",         closed: true     },     {         name : "ProductB",         key: "AAA",         closed: false     }     ],  secondItems : [  {         desc : "test2",         misc: "3333",     },     {         desc : "test1",         misc: "123"     }    ] ]  </code></pre>
