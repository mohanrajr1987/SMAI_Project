<p>I'm trying to make some changes on CMS, which uses ExtJs 3. What I want is to add 2 buttons: </p>  <ol> <li>Show all posts</li> <li>Show only my posts (there is a column called "Member")</li> </ol>  <p>I've founded the solution <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10348581/add-a-custom-button-in-column-header-dropdown-menus-extjs-4">here </a>, but it uses ExtJs 4 and is incompatible with older version. How can I do it for ExtJs 3?</p>
