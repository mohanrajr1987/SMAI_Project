<p>Most of the time I create a project I miss a lot of necessary files such as the bootstrap and Json files.</p>  <p>I have all the dependencies (Ruby, JDK, Apache Ant) and Sencha CMD 5.1 (6 gives me alot of problems), I have also set my custom Cmd Base Path to cmd/5.1.3.61</p>  <p>It's a lot like a hit in miss, i'll create and save a lot of projects in different places hoping that 1 will provide me with all the necessary files needed to code properly (had to create over 10 projects for me to get a project folder with all the files in, and save them all in different directories).</p>  <p>Anyone know the cause of this or how to fix it so that Sencha Architect will give me all the necessary files with each project I create?</p>  <p>I've tried Saving As the project folder to a different location, using sencha cmd web start, saving the entire project and (it's not letting me build the project as it is greyed out)</p>  <p>Also tried reinstalling sencha architect, cmd, and all its dependencies; problem still occuring.</p>
