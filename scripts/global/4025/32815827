<p>In my application, we are using extjs for generating grids. there are multiple autocompletes there. For many of the autocompletes, data is hard coded in the corrosponding store js.</p>  <p>Issue is when user types additional spaces then autocomplete doesn't work. I have to fix this issue. I tried stripCharsRe, but it is not an solution, because i can not restrict user from entering space. I need to perform trim some where in between. Any suggestion?</p>
