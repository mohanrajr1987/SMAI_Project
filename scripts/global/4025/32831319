<p>I've got a panel with a total of 4 items:</p>  <ul> <li>In the "north" region I've got a grid and a chart showing projects</li> <li>In the "center" region I've got a grid and a chart showing cost center data</li> </ul>  <p>Now I would like to "synchronize" the two vertical splitters, so that all splitters form a cross. With the code below it's possible to have a projectGrid wider than the costCenterGrid, for example.</p>  <p>I've check the source and found the Ext.resizer.SplitterTracker class, and it's quite clear that I'd need to listen to the dragend event. However I didn't manage to locate the splitters inside their panels.</p>  <pre><code>var borderPanel = Ext.create('Ext.panel.Panel', {     layout: 'border',     defaults: { split: true },     items: [{         region: 'north',         xtype: 'panel',         layout: 'border',         shrinkWrap: true,         defaults: { split: true},         items: [             projectGrid,                     // west             portfolioPlannerProjectPanel     // center         ]     }, {         region: 'center',         xtype: 'panel',         layout: 'border',         shrinkWrap: true,         defaults: { split: true, },         items: [             costCenterGrid,                  // west             portfolioPlannerCostCenterPanel  // center         ]     }] }); </code></pre>
