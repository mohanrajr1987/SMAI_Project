<p>Here is the code</p>  <pre><code>@interface ViewController () @property (nonatomic, strong) NSOperationQueue *queue; @end   @implementation ViewController - (void)viewDidLoad {     [super viewDidLoad];      _queue = [[NSOperationQueue alloc] init];      NSBlockOperation *aBlockOperation = [[NSBlockOperation alloc] init];     __weak NSBlockOperation* aWeakBlockOperation = aBlockOperation;      [aBlockOperation addExecutionBlock:^{         NSLog(@"queue should still have the operation. And it does. yay!: %@", [_queue operations]); // This should print correctly. It will show the NSBlock operation correctly residing inside the NSOperationQueue         dispatch_after(dispatch_time(DISPATCH_TIME_NOW, (int64_t)(3.0 * NSEC_PER_SEC)), dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{             NSLog(@"Now queue is empty??: %@", [_queue operations]); // This should print as being empty             NSLog(@"And a weak block is nil???: %@", aWeakBlockOperation); // This should print out **nil**             if (![aWeakBlockOperation isCancelled]) {                 // Now i have no way to check the operation             }          });     }];      [_queue addOperation:aBlockOperation]; @end </code></pre>  <p>[<strong>Edit</strong>] The goal is to have a user interaction like this: There is a tableView on screen with 5 or more cells. When ever a user click a cell, background process will perform background process that will take a while. The App will, at 3 second intervals, check to see if the user clicked on another cell. If the user clicked on another cell, I should cancel the current operation from queue, and begin processing the new one the user clicked on.</p>  <p>From the code above i have 2 problems i cant solve.</p>  <ol> <li><p>How do i make it so that my weak reference isnt deallocated in the dispatch_after block? The goal of putting it there is to pause the app for exactly 3 seconds. If dispatch_after is incorrect, then what code do i use there to prevent it becoming nil?</p></li> <li><p>Why is it that my NSOperationQueue become empty after I call dispatch_after? Is there a way to make it not become empty?</p></li> </ol>
