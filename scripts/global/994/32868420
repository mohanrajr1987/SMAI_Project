<p>Is there any class/function which gets me the whole system information object?</p>  <p>With system information object I mean all the data that we can see if we open the System Information app on OS X.</p>  <p>I have found a few classes so far, that gives me some information, but not all.</p>  <p>I fear there is no class which can give me all the information at once since I have not found anything in the documentation yet, but I might have overseen it since I am pretty new to OS X development and not yet familiar with the SDKs.</p>
