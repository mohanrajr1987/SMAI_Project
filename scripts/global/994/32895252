<p>I want to place a window directly behind the window with the highest window level, and not just the window with the highest level in my app, but for all active apps.</p>  <p>My first idea was to do something like this</p>  <pre><code>let activeWindow = //Problems finding a reference to this window.  myWindow.makeKeyAndOrderFront(nil) activeWindow.makeKeyAndOrderFront(nil) </code></pre>  <p>By this way I would get a reference to the active window. Position my window at the top, and then reposition the previous active window on top again. Then all other windows would be positioned under mine.</p>  <p>Do someone know how to do this?</p>
