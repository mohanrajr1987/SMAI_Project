<p>A couple of years ago I began learning to code, and naturally began with apps for the devices I use, particularly macs. So most of what I've learned is confined to the Xcode IDE, Objective C and Swift, and the Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks.  It's been a cozy environment. </p>  <p>But I'm ready to spread my wings a bit, and would like to begin learning to prepare apps, particularly for Windows users. </p>  <p>Keeping in mind that I still use a Mac (though I have access to Windows computers I can test on), what would be a good path for broadening my capabilities in this way? Is there a preferred IDE? What language(s) should I begin learning? Are there key frameworks that are parallel to Cocoa?</p>
