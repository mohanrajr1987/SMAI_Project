<p>I would like to have the following functionality in my app: </p>  <p>When I type the DNA sequence (string) in the NSTextView window at the same time in my TableView for each enzyme (each of them representing small string) user immediately see the number of found sites (string) corresponding to each enzyme (0 or any number). </p>  <p>I have a function, which I can use to find all possible locations (returning NSRanges array) of string in string. In my case this will be to find in DNA sequence (string) all possible sites (strings NSRanges) corresponding for each enzyme. </p>  <p>Thus, one more time, question is how to implement this function: at the time of typing a string to find all sites (in form of array of NSRanges) in this string and put the numbers found site in table accordingly for each enzyme. </p>  <p>In other words, the function returning NSRanges array for positions of enzymes sites should start automatically.</p>  <p><strong>Update</strong></p>  <p>I am new in cocoa and after suggestions from <strong>R Menke</strong> I have more probably stupid questions. I have one controller class as subclass of NSWindowController. I cannot put code from <strong>R Menke</strong> to this class. And, in my controller class I have my NSTextView where user will type the text as @IBOutlet, should I use this? Should I make another controller file ? Below the code and errors. </p>  <pre><code>import Cocoa //Error. Multiple inheritance from classes 'NSWindowController' and   'NSViewController' class AllUnderControl: NSWindowController, NSViewController,NSTextViewDelegate { override var windowNibName: String? { return "AllUnderControl" }  override func windowDidLoad() {     super.windowDidLoad() }  //Error. Instance member 'inputDnaFromUser' cannot be used on type 'AllUnderControl' var textView = inputDnaFromUser(frame: CGRectZero)   //Error. Method does not override any method from its superclass override func viewDidLoad() {     textView.delegate = self }  func textDidChange(notification: NSNotification) {     // trigger your function }  @IBOutlet var inputDnaFromUser: NSTextView! </code></pre>  <p><strong>Update 2</strong> After reading the description of two controllers: NSWindowController and NSViewController I have made the following changes below. Is it correct for triggering function ? </p>  <pre><code>import Cocoa  class AllUnderControl: NSWindowController, NSTextViewDelegate { override var windowNibName: String? { return "AllUnderControl" }  override func windowDidLoad() {     super.windowDidLoad()     inputDnaFromUser.delegate = self }  func textDidChange(notification: NSNotification) {      // trigger your function }  @IBOutlet var inputDnaFromUser: NSTextView! = NSTextView(frame: CGRectZero) </code></pre>
