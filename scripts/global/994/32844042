<p>I have previously tried to implement CloudKit with a OSX/iOS app, and because of my OCD-ness, I became very worried about prioritizing certain data between devices, and possibly losing data or reviving deleted data.</p>  <p>My logic is, comparing the updated datetime of the data obtained from iCloud, and locally from CoreData, with the same unique id, then prioritizing the data that has a later updated datetime.</p>  <p>Another issue is whether the user decides to use iCloud or not.</p>  <p>Is this the best way of approaching it? Do you have any suggestion, sample code, or libraries that you know that could make CloudKit easier?</p>
