<p>From alerts, I'm assuming this picture represents is a panel, not a sheet (my understanding is that sheets are overlays over already open apps). </p>  <p>I'm looking to create a custom, or just built in 'clean' popup alert (notification). I can't seem to find anything within NSAlert that speaks of customizing the alert - alertType seems like it might but apparently it is for conveying importance.</p>  <p>An example is something like this:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/WJhV8.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/WJhV8.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>(source: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/WJhV8.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i.stack.imgur.com/WJhV8.jpg</a>)</p>
