<p>I have the following situation:</p>  <ul> <li>there is a main, non-sandboxed application;</li> <li>there is a Finder Sync plugin, bundled into this application. Sandboxed;</li> <li>there is a XPC helper bundled into this application. Sandboxed.</li> </ul>  <p>Problem: opening NSXPCConnection from main application to XPC helper works fine. However, I cannot connect to it from the Finder Sync plugin, and do not receive any error information (just callback 'Connection invalidated' right after trying to open it).</p>  <p>Am I doing something wrong, or this should be done in other way? For instance, by moving XPC helper to the separate application? Some problems with entitlements? </p>
