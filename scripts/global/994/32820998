<p>I am new to Mac, I want to develop an app similar to gotomeeting. I want to capture the desktop with excluding a specific AIR app in Mac OS X. I have searched but I have found only screencapture utility through which I can capture either whole desktop or a specific window if the windowid is known. Is there any way to capture the Desktop excluding a Window. If so please help me.</p>
