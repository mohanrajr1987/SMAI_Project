<p>I'm trying to debug an issue caused by the change of a next responder of the main <code>NSWindow</code>. I have an internal <code>NSView</code> and a chain of custom <code>NSResponder</code>, however even after debugging and sticking breakpoints all over every <code>setNextResponder</code>, I never stop on one of them and all I do is just changing the window's style.</p>  <p>How can I get what changed the next responder? Is it just because of the style change? I can't find it in the documentation. Is there something I'm missing? What are the operations that can mess up with the responders chain?</p>
