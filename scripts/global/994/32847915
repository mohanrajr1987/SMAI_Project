<p>I'm not really sure how to phrase this question, but I'll try my best. I have an NSTask that currently unzips an archive, and it needs to also support archives which might have a password. I have no idea how to go about pausing the task or how to detect if a password might be present, get the input if needed then proceed, or if this is even possible?</p>  <pre><code>NSTask *unzip = [[NSTask alloc] init]; [unzip setLaunchPath:@"/usr/bin/unzip"]; [unzip setArguments:[NSArray arrayWithObjects:@"-u", @"-d",                       destination, zipFile, nil]];  NSPipe *aPipe = [[NSPipe alloc] init]; [unzip setStandardOutput:aPipe];  [unzip launch];  // if statement here?  [unzip waitUntilExit]; [unzip release]; </code></pre>  <p>From terminal stdout looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>Archive: encrypted.zip    creating: test [encrypted.zip] test password:     skipping: test  incorrect password </code></pre>  <p>Also I wish not to limit this to zip files, since I also use a similar task to untar/gzip archives.  Is there are way to have the NSTask pop up a modal window if it detects an archive with a password or from certain stdout it might receive? </p>
