<p>Take for example a view in cocoa or uikit.  It has a function setNeedsDisplay. You can call it as often as you want and once in each loop of the runtime it will update the view.</p>  <p>I want to do something similar. I have to update my data structures, but there are many paths in which the data can be invalided once or multiple times (within a function or by many functions). Once the data is reloaded I need to update the view (via setNeedsDisplay).</p>  <p>The data can be expensive to recalculate just like the view drawing.</p>  <p>There is not a one to one relationship with setNeedsDisplay. setNeedsDisplay can be called when the view resizes which does not necessarily invalidates the data.</p>  <p>How would you architecture this? Obviously I need a setNeedsData function that sets a flag. But when do I check the flag and thus when do I need to do the actual work?</p>
