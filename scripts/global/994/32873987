<p>I am reading "Cocoa programming for OS X" (The Big Neard Ranch Guid) and I have made a simplest application to test an empty windows app with a window controller and xib file for this controller. I have wrote all necessary code according to the book but after building the app and closing the window of app I cannot reopen the window of the app. What is wrong ? Below the code. (I deleted window in MainMenu.xib and accordingly changed AppDelegate; and Visible at Launch box is unchecked) ). The book says that showWindow(_:) will reopen the window, but I don't see this !</p>  <pre><code>import Cocoa   @NSApplicationMain  class AppDelegate: NSObject, NSApplicationDelegate {  var control: Control?  func applicationDidFinishLaunching(aNotification: NSNotification) {      //Create a window controller object     let control = Control()      //Put the window of the window controler om the screen     control.showWindow(self)      //Set the propertity to point to window controler     self.control = control  }   func applicationWillTerminate(aNotification: NSNotification) {     // Insert code here to tear down your application }   } </code></pre>  <p>in my controller class</p>  <pre><code>import Cocoa class Control: NSWindowController {     override var windowNibName: String?         {             return "Control" } } </code></pre>  <p>In File's Owner identity is for Control controller and window has been connected to window outlet. </p>
