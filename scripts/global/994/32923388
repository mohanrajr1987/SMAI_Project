<p>I have code to write Java file into Java Extensions directory, but I got this message:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>(the file) couldn’t be copied because you don’t have permission to access “Extensions”</p> </blockquote>  <p>It worked fine before last update. </p>  <p>How I can request the user permission?</p>  <p>This is my code: </p>  <pre><code>let source = NSBundle.mainBundle().URLForResource("mysql-connector-java-5.1.26-bin", withExtension: "jar") let destnaition = NSURL(fileURLWithPath: "/Library/Java/Extensions/mysql-connector-java-5.1.26-bin.jar") try! fileManager.copyItemAtURL(source!, toURL:destnaition) </code></pre>
