<p>About the outlineView:objectValueForTableColumn:byItem: data source method, there is a note in document says that:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>While this method is marked as @optional in the protocol, you must implement this method if you are not providing the data for the outline view using Cocoa bindings.</p> </blockquote>  <p>However, the SideBar demo of Apple samples doesn't implement this method, and can't find any cocoa bindings either, does anyone know why?</p>
