<p>Whenever I'm viewing memory addresses within my Cocoa application, I notice (in general) 3 main categories of addresses</p>  <ul> <li><code>0x00006xxxxxxx</code> </li> <li><code>0x00007fffxxxx</code> </li> <li><code>0x0000001xxxxx</code></li> </ul>  <p>I have an idea of what is what-- like I noticed that the <code>0x00006xxxxxxx</code> addresses seem to be <strong>pointers</strong> to my application's objects?</p>  <p>and <code>0x0000001xxxxx</code> appears to be addresses to the <strong>actual</strong> objects in memory?</p>  <p>But I really am not sure of anything, and am unable to form good a Google query to give me an answer.  </p>  <p>Does anybody have a resource, or know how to identify the categories of addresses in a Cocoa application?</p>
