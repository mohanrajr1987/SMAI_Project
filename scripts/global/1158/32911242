<p>I'm working with Qt/C++ creating my own app, I want it to be cross-platform, so far everything it's been working great with Qt, the only problem its with the tray-icon. </p>  <p>I create a tray-icon and add a menu to it, this works fine in windows but it's not working in Linux. I test my app in two computers and got two different respond. </p>  <p>In my desktop (Ubuntu 14.04) the tray-Icon appears on the right side of the task-bar as expected but it doesn't show me the menu. And in the laptop (also Ubuntu 14.04) the tray-icon appears on the left side of the task-bar but in this case it does shows me the menu and a message when I double click the icon.</p>  <p>I don't know if there's another way to do this but here it's my code.</p>  <pre><code>if (QSystemTrayIcon::isSystemTrayAvailable()) {   //trayicon   trayIcon = new QSystemTrayIcon(this);   trayIcon-&gt;setIcon(QIcon(":/Imagenes/iconosPERFQ-23.png"));   trayIcon-&gt;setToolTip(tr("PerfQ Client"));   trayIcon-&gt;setVisible(true);    connect(trayIcon, SIGNAL(activated(QSystemTrayIcon::ActivationReason)),                  this, SLOT(iconActivated(QSystemTrayIcon::ActivationReason)));   //Menu   logoutAction = new QAction(tr("&amp;Logout"), this);   trayIconMenu = new QMenu(this);   trayIconMenu-&gt;addAction(logoutAction);   // Add the menu to the trayicon   trayIcon-&gt;setContextMenu(trayIconMenu);    connect (logoutAction,SIGNAL(triggered()), this, SLOT(logout())); } </code></pre>  <p>and the slot for the activated signal on the trayicon</p>  <pre><code>void Task::iconActivated(QSystemTrayIcon::ActivationReason reason) {   switch (reason)   {     case QSystemTrayIcon::DoubleClick:       QMessageBox::information(this,"Double Click", "Double click has been press on trayicon");       break;     default:       ;   } } </code></pre>
