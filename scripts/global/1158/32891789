<p>I try to create a <code>gui</code> with two main <code>widgets</code>. The window should be resizable. When resized horizontally only one of them widgets should expand. When resized vertically both should expand. Furthermore it should be possible readjust the resize this split horizontally. I illustrated this to make it more clear:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/iAqHX.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/iAqHX.png" alt="Resize behavior"></a></p>  <p>With <code>tkinter</code> this was easily achievable with the properties <code>expand</code> and <code>fill</code>. In <code>Qt</code> I could use the <code>resize event</code> but I hope that I don't have to do this manually, since this should after all be a common task. I tried toying around with <code>QHBoxLayout</code> but without success unfortunately.</p>  <p>Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks.</p>
