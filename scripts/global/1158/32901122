<p>All I would like to do is to be able to open a new dialog from my MainWindow. I want to be able to design the dialog in Qt designer and then use the signals and slots editor to link a button press in my main window to the display of a new dialog. The dialog needs to have a couple of line edits and buttons in it and I want to avoid writing a new class in C++ every time i want a different dialog.</p>  <p>How can I link my main window to another dialog i created in qt designer?</p>
