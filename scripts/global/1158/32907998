<p>I have my "MainWindonw" file and "Plot" file with a class to plot.</p>  <p>Currently I can display my Plot in two different ways:</p>  <ol> <li><p>I can create in my UI form a widget and promote the Plot class. (in this way I can put my Plot in any place that I want)</p></li> <li><p>I can use the explicit declaration on code as:</p>  <pre><code>d_plot = new Plot( this ); .... setCentralWidget( d_plot ); </code></pre>  <p>However in this way I can't have control on my Plot, it just go to mainwindow</p></li> </ol>  <p>So my question is, how can I use something like the the code from item 2 to plot on my widget on UI form.</p>  <p>It's possible to do something like:</p>  <pre><code>    setWidgetCreated (d_plot); </code></pre>
