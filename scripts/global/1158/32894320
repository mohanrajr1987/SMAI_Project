<p>I received a smallish C++ dev package from a friend that was developed on Linux and  uses Qt3D. On Linux, one can just open the associated .pro file in QtCreator, hit build, then run, everything works fine.  When following the same steps on Win7, it builds and runs, but the executable can't find OpenGL.</p>  <p>To solve this, do I need to compile Qt locally on Win7, adding the appropriate -lopengl flag (or equivalent), then point QtCreator to this local version and rebuild? Or is there something else I need to do or be aware of.  Thank you very much in advance.</p>
