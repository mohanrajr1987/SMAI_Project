<p>I am on a ubunto 12.0.4 LTS OS. I am trying to implement CMUX multiplexing protocol on the serial port to which I have a serial GSM modem connected.  I was following instructions this page, <a href="http://source.sierrawireless.com/resources/sagemcomm2m/hilo/mux_07,-d-,10_linux_implementation_for_hilo_and_hilonc/" rel="nofollow">http://source.sierrawireless.com/resources/sagemcomm2m/hilo/mux_07,-d-,10_linux_implementation_for_hilo_and_hilonc/</a></p>  <p>where I downloaded a zip file which C programs to implement. Zip file uploaded here, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/lbr5k2ln6ec3904/MUX_0710_Guidelines_and_Sources.zip?dl=0" rel="nofollow">https://www.dropbox.com/s/lbr5k2ln6ec3904/MUX_0710_Guidelines_and_Sources.zip?dl=0</a></p>  <p>As per the instructions there, I have to download sudo apt-get install qt4-make . But,I am not able to download this on my ubuntu OS 12.0.4 LTS. It says cannot locate package.</p>  <p>In the serial signals folder attached in the zip above, I have to execute qmake SerialSignals.pro, which works and this is the output,</p>  <p>/Desktop/sierra/gsmMUX/AppliMux/SerialSignals# qmake SerialSignals.pro  (From the drop folder,gsmMUX/AppliMUX/SerialSignals )</p>  <pre><code>uic: File generated with too old version of Qt Designer (3.3)  </code></pre>  <p>After doing I am supposed to execute the make command. When I type in make, the output is </p>  <pre><code>File 'SerialSignals.ui' is not valid make: *** [.ui/ui_SerialSignals.h] Error 1 </code></pre>  <p>How do I resolve this ? How do I install qt4-make ? Is this required for compilation of Serial Signals based on the error above ?</p>
