<p>In Qt/C++, I have a series of buttons where I want to run them through one single event handler for the click, and know which one was clicked.</p>  <p>Is there a way to connect a list of button click events to one slot? As in, I create a <code>QList&lt;QPushButton *&gt;</code>, and then use a single <code>connect()</code> statement to handle this list's <code>&amp;QPushButton::clicked</code> signals, and map this to one single <code>SLOT(onButtonClicked(QWidget *))</code>.</p>  <p>Keyword there -- single. Sure, I can iterate a list, but I want to know if there's a way to have only one <code>connect()</code> statement that's outside the list iteration.</p>  <p>In other words, I'm wanting to know if there's already an efficient way to do this that I may not realize, rather than me iterating a <code>QList</code> of <code>QPushButton</code>. It's just a matter of being efficient and tidy.</p>
