<p>I have an app written in QT that uses QTimer. It's basically a game and all the actions are controlled by the timer. Game includes the ability to increase\decrease the game speed. The code for increasing the speed is</p>  <pre><code>    timerValue -= speedUpValue;     if (timerValue &lt; maxSpeed) {         timerValue = maxSpeed;     }     timer -&gt; setInterval(timerValue);  </code></pre>  <p><code>speedUpValue</code>and <code>maxSpeed</code> are constants. Almost the same code is used for decreasing the speed. The problem is that <code>setInterval</code> resets the internal timer and therefore if you keep rapidly increasing or decreasing the speed game eventually never proceeds because <code>remainingTime</code> is constantly being reset. Is there a way to set <code>remainingTime</code> manually or change the interval without resetting it? </p>
