<p>We have large project that used .NET Framework for showing forms/windows. Recently i decided to deprecate CLR dependency and move to Qt. </p>  <p>While learning Qt, we've migrated from Visual studio 2013 to 2015 and then i noticed that there is no qt support for MSVC 14 version which vs2015 use.</p>  <p>Additionally, Qt vs addin was not working jn visual studio express/community edition we use. Is there any chance for me to use Qt and qt addin in our projects?</p>  <p>Searching web did not help, and it looks like no one use Qt with latest Visual Studio?</p>
