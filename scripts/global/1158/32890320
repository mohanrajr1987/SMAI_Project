<p>I'm having a hard time deploying dynamic shared libraries on iOS.</p>  <p>To isolate and expose the problem, I have a very simple "HelloWorld" project: A library exporting class with a function returning "Hello World" and a program using the class and displaying the message. </p>  <p>I'm using QtCreator with Qt 5.5.</p>  <p>I'm able to generate the <code>.dylib</code> file and link my program. But, when I deploy it on the iPhone, I get the error:</p>  <pre><code>DÃ©marrage des processus distants. dyld: Library not loaded: libMyLib.1.dylib   Referenced from: /private/var/mobile/Containers/Bundle/Application/D6942CCE-828D-4C10-86DA-F7DA7ADF7449/MyApp.app/MyApp   Reason: image not found  </code></pre>  <p>On Android, I had the same kind of issue and could fix it by manually adding the shared library to the final package (apk) file, using <code>ANDROID_EXTRA_LIBS</code>. But I can find no equivalent for iOS.</p>  <p>Here are my .pro files. Full project can be downloaded <a href="https://bugreports.qt.io/secure/attachment/51438/bug_dylib.zip" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I reported this to <a href="https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTCREATORBUG-15135" rel="nofollow">Qt as a bug</a>, but if one could propose a kind of workaround this would help!</p>  <p><strong>MyLib.pro:</strong></p>  <pre><code>QT       -= core gui  TARGET = MyLib TEMPLATE = lib  DEFINES += MYLIB_LIBRARY  SOURCES += mylib.cpp  CONFIG += shared  HEADERS += mylib.h\         mylib_global.h </code></pre>  <p><strong>MyApp.pro:</strong></p>  <pre><code>QT       += core gui  greaterThan(QT_MAJOR_VERSION, 4): QT += widgets  TARGET = MyApp TEMPLATE = app   SOURCES += main.cpp\         dialog.cpp  HEADERS  += dialog.h  INCLUDEPATH += ../MyLib  LIBS += ../MyLib/libMyLib.dylib </code></pre>  <p>I'd like the solution to be all embedded in QtCreator. The only think that should be changed here is one of the two .pro files. Possibly with post-build calls to MACOS commands...? Or just a post-build instruction in MyApp.pro to copy the dylib in the right place (.app target folder) before application is deployed? I'm really surprised this is not covered silently by QtCreator....</p>  <p>Note: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13611740/qt-mac-osx-10-8-dyld-library-not-loaded-image-not-found">This question</a> suggests to set <code>DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>. But I have no clue hox to do this within the MyApp.pro file nor how it will help upon iOS deployment (as DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH can be set the MAC PATH to the lib, not the iPhone PATH to the lib...)</p>
