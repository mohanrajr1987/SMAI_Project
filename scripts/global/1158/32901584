<p>I want to use socket with buttons,displays in qt(c++).  Is it possible?  I have tried to use socket in qt widget application.  But i can't inherit the socket class from main Window class.my goal is to design the GUI at server using qt.  The data should be displayed on display widget and also to provide the button for other functionalities.  But as per my experience i come to know that i can't use socket with widgets(button,display etc.). So, is it possible to use socket in widget application? </p>
