<p>I found a rather strange bug related to both windows and Qt.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>OS: Windows 7 64bit</p> </blockquote>  <p>The phenomenon: </p>  <blockquote>   <ol>   <li>when you put some very large files to the folder where you put all your qsqlite related dll</li>   <li>open your app but DO NOT call any qsqlite function.</li>   <li>open a file Dialog, like selecting a txt file, select a file and press Ok.</li>   <li>trigger the UI to call qsqlite functions in Multi-threads.</li>   <li>the program actually crashed where it is trying to add a qsqlite database.</li>   </ol> </blockquote>  <p>I was totally shocked by this behavior, any one could share some guess, thoughts or suggestions? Or how could this even be possible?</p>
