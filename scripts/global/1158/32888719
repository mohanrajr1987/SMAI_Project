<p>I have a QTextEdit where text can be inserted as html. This text needs to be sent over a QTcpSocket.</p>  <p>I retrieve the text from the QTextEdit as follows:</p>  <pre><code>  QString text = ui-&gt;message-&gt;toPlainText();   socket-&gt;write(text.toLatin1().data()); </code></pre>  <p>This works well for text without HTML, but otherwise I get just <code>??</code> for it.  Is there another possibility to transform the text or do I have to chose a completely different approach?</p>
