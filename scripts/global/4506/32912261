<p>I have a FabricJS canvas that has to be converted to a PDF that matches the exact fractional inches for print production as follows:</p>  <pre><code>Width (Inches): 38.703111 Height (Inches): 25.999987 </code></pre>  <p>Since the requirements are a DPI of 300, I obtained the pixels by multiplying the width and height x 300 as follows:</p>  <pre><code>38.703111 inches x 300 =  11610.9333 px 25.999987 inches x 300 = 7799.9961 px </code></pre>  <p>With these measurements in hand, I created a FabricJS canvas that users could edit and then convert to an image (will need to figure out how to convert it to a PDF server side later/suspecting node.js with the pdfkit module). </p>  <p>Since it is not usable to have a 11610 x 7799px Canvas on a page, I set the size of the canvas as follows:</p>  <pre><code>Width: 650px Height: 436.6571863 (Orginal Height * New Width / Orginal Width = new height) </code></pre>  <p>Here is what my Canvas looks like (HTML) and corresponding JavaScript code to render it:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;canvas id="c" width="650" height="436.6571863" style="border:1px solid"&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;  var canvas = new fabric.Canvas('c', {}); </code></pre>  <p>Users are able to edit the canvas and then convert it to an image, but this is the problem occurs. I attempt to scale the canvas via FabricJS' toDataURL method using a multiplier of <strong>17.86297431</strong>  (Original Width in Pixels / New Width in Pixels and Original Height in Pixels / New Height in Pixels both equal a multiplier of 17.86297431) as follows:</p>  <pre><code>var dataURL = canvas.toDataURL({         format: 'png',         multiplier: 17.86297431     })  document.write('&lt;img src="' + dataURL + '"/&gt;'); </code></pre>  <p>However, once it scales, the width of my outputted image appears correct at 11610, but the height is off at 7788 when it should be 7799. This output does not show fractions, but rather just the whole pixels when I inspect the element.</p>  <p>My question is, how can I get my FabricJS Canvas to properly scale up to the pixels (or inches) so I can have my PDF (converted from my PNG) in the correct dimensions? Is this an issue with pixel fractions not being respected/what can I do about this?</p>
