<p>I get the following error when trying to access a user's invitable friends list through a Facebook Canvas App:</p>  <p>"error":{"message":"(#15) This method is only accessible to Games."</p>  <p>I have searched all over the web and the consensus to get past this error is that your app has to be :</p>  <ul> <li>classified as a 'Game' within your app's settings</li> <li>have a Canvas presence - which means enabling the Canvas platform within your app's settings</li> </ul>  <p>So my Facebook app was already set as a Canvas app. I did this under 'Settings' and just added my Secure Canvas URL. </p>  <p>Next I had to classify my app as a 'game'. OK, less clear, but I changed the Category of my app to 'Game' under 'App Details' and I also set a 'Sub Category' for my game. </p>  <p>But the error persists. I am still getting: "error":{"message":"(#15) This method is only accessible to Games."</p>  <p>The call that generates this error is just the stock standard invitable friends javascript that I got from the Facebook website: </p>  <pre><code>/* make the API call */ FB.api(   "/me/invitable_friends",   function (response) {     if (response &amp;&amp; !response.error) {       /* handle the result */     }   } ); </code></pre>  <p>Please help!</p>
