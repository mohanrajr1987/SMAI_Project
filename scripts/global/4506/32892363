<p>I'd like to blend a small canvas element over a large parent background element.  I've tried the following without success:</p>  <p>JS:<code>ctx.globalCompositeOperation = "overlay";</code></p>  <p>I believe globalCompositeOperation only works on elements drawn on each other in canvas.</p>  <p>CSS:<code>background-blend-mode: overlay;</code></p>  <p>I thought the css background-blend-mode <em>might</em> work, but alas no.</p>  <p>I understand the canvas element is in its own little world and that blending it with other html elements is a shot in the dark - just wanted to confirm I'm not missing anything.  </p>
