<p>I use <code>createjs.TweenJS</code> for twining objects on my canvas game. Problem is when I switch tab, Tween pauses and continues process after tabs is focused back.</p>  <p>My goal is to show stage state on current time situation, when tab is focused back. If say it in different way, when I switch tab, processes mustn't pause, but run in background.</p>  <p>If I switch TweenJS timing mode to TIMEOUT instead of requestAnimationFrame (RAF), everything works well.</p>  <p>Is it possible to achieve same result using requestAnimationFrame timing mode? </p>
