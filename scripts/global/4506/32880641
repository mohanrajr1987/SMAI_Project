<p>I am trying to paint an image on a canvas before I get its <code>dataURL()</code>, but the data returned is like empty.  </p>  <p>When I check it in the console, I see there is a lot of <code>A</code> in the string : (<code>"data:image/png;base64,iVBO..some random chars... bQhfoAAAAAAAAAA... a lot of A ...AAAASUVORK5CYII="</code>)</p>  <p>When I try to append the canvas to the document, nothing is drawn either and I don't have any error thrown in the console.   </p>  <p>What is the problem here ?</p>  <p>Here is my code : </p>  <pre><code>var img = new Image(); img.src = "http://somerandomWebsite/picture.png"; var canvas = document.createElement('canvas'); canvas.width = img.width; canvas.height = img.height; var context = canvas.getContext('2d'); context.drawImage(img, 0,0); // this doesn't seem to work var dataURL = canvas.toDataURL(); // this will give me a lot of "A"     doSomething(dataURL); </code></pre>  <p>Also, when doing a quick refresh, the image gets drawn correctly onto the canvas but I've got an error message in the console and <code>dataURL</code> is empty.  </p>  <p>The message in Firefox is : <em>"SecurityError: The operation is insecure."</em>,<br> in Chrome it is <em>"Uncaught SecurityError: Failed to execute 'toDataURL' on 'HTMLCanvasElement': Tainted canvases may not be exported."</em>,<br> and on IE I just get <em>"SecurityError"</em>.  </p>  <p>What does it mean ?</p>
