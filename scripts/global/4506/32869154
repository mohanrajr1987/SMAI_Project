<p>I am trying to animate a group of 'pods' moving from station to station. However, if more than one moves, they all move at once. </p>  <p>Simplified version here: <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/d3sL5gzj/4/" rel="nofollow">https://jsfiddle.net/d3sL5gzj/4/</a></p>  <p>I have tried using setInterval to delay each one by, say, 100ms, but I can't work out how to do it. </p>  <p>I presume it has to work with the animate() function, but it only works on delaying all animation. e.g. </p>  <pre><code>setTimeout(animate, 1000) </code></pre>  <p>Any help appreciated -- this is stumping me!</p>
