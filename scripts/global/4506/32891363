<p>I am trying to use Android's onDraw function to draw rectangles and lines with shadows around them so they can be seen on a white backgrounds. I have my Paint set up to have a shadowlayer but there is no shadow when the lines are drawn.</p>  <p>Here is my code for the Paint:</p>  <pre><code>paint = new Paint(); paint.setColor(Color.WHITE); paint.setStyle(Paint.Style.FILL); paint.setTextSize(m_textSize); paint.setAntiAlias(true); Typeface font = Typeface.create("Times New Roman", Typeface.NORMAL); paint.setTypeface(font); paint.setShadowLayer(5, 0, 0, Color.BLACK); this.setLayerType(View.LAYER_TYPE_HARDWARE, paint); </code></pre>  <p>And here is my drawing code:</p>  <pre><code>private void drawMark(Canvas c, float y, float size)     {     float x = (float) (getWidth()-5.0-size);     c.drawRect(x, y, x + size, y + markHeight, paint);     } </code></pre>  <p>Is there something I am missing to make the shadow work for drawRect?</p>  <p>Please note that I am also using the canvas to draw text and the text does get the shadow effect, but shapes and lines do not.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
