<p>I want to draw the X-axis, i.e. a horizontal line at Y = 0, to better see where the positive and negative values of Y are.</p>  <p>I want something like this:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/s3bNO.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/s3bNO.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Is this possible in <a href="http://www.chartjs.org/" rel="nofollow">Chart.js</a></p>  <p><strong>EDIT 1</strong></p>  <p>I want to draw the line in the Chart object, so being able to interact with it. For example: points over the X-axis could be drawn green and points under it could be red.</p>
