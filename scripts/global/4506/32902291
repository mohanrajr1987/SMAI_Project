<p>I am developing the watch face of wearable application in android. I am getting trouble to implement the zoom in and zoom out  , and swipe  gesture of canvas, if                     I would override the <code>onTouchEvent(MotionEvent event)</code> method of <code>CanvasWatchFaceService</code>, then the <code>onTouchEvent(MotionEvent event)</code> is conflict with it.</p>  <p>I tried the <code>onTapCommand(@TapType int tapType, int x, int y, long eventTime)</code> for single tap as its support by watch face but still nothing is working..</p>  <p>Any idea? How i can archive swipe or zoom in and zoom out in  watch face ?</p>
