<p>I am looking for a framework for developing a user interface for mobile applications. Is is designed as a large canvas upon which custom blocks with names etc. can be inserted and linked with eachother with arrows. Kind of like a mindmap would look like...</p>  <p>Does anyone have experience with this sort of user interface, I was looking at unity3D (having the option for 2D games) because I have some unity experience. </p>  <p>Is there anything else I should consider, besides gaming engines? </p>  <p>iOS is targeted, cross platform would be a huge plus!</p>  <p>Thank you very much,</p>
