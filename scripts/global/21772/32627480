<p>I have some text in a list view. The format of each text contains a (1 or more) user's name inside as in:</p>  <p><code>This is a message for @[Joe Bloggs](id:100), hi how are you, from @[John Doe](id:50). I am fine.</code></p>  <p>I need to replace it with the following:</p>  <p><code>This is a message for @Joe Bloggs, hi how are you, from @John Doe. I am fine.</code></p>  <p>When you click on the user's name it should open an activity passing in the user's id.</p>  <p>What is the REGEX and logic that i need to do this operation, and what is the most efficient way of extracting the username and id, and replacing the text with the user's name in a clickable spannable text to open the activity with the user's id.</p>  <p>Bearing in mine, this is in a list view.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
