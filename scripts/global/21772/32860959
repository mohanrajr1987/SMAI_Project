<p>How to make the scrollable textview always focus on the first line/focus top?</p>  <p>Problem: When I scroll the textview to the third line at the first page,it will assume there are also three lines of text in the second page, causing the text "disappears" when my second page has only one line of text.</p>  <p><code>txtCaptions.scrollTo(0,txtCaptions.getLayout().getLineTop(0));</code> doesn't work for me.</p>
