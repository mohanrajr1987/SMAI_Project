<p>I wanted to create a custom text view. A little bit advance just as the text editor found here in StackOverflow, I can insert text and even images. I wanted to name this as WordView and create this as a library so I can reuse this across multiple projects.</p>  <p>Unfortunately I am not so sure if the base class allows this. I need a way to insert/paste images directly in the EditText. I am planning to write a custom View, although it seems laborious, I am not quite certain if this is possible at all and if I am going into the right track.</p>  <p>Have anyone tried similar before?</p>
