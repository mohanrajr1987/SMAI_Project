<p>I am developing a native android game. I have several test devices. My application works very slowly at one of them (HTC One m7,Android 5.0.2). I found two main reasons that slow my application:</p>  <ul> <li><p>First main reason is using setText method of TextView (called every second in a timer). When I remove setText methods from the code, application works fine. Setting static text is also slow. I am sure that problem is setText method itself.</p></li> <li><p>Second main reason is several animations in layout (AnimationDrawable).</p></li> </ul>  <p>After some research, some people think that setting TextView dimensions to exact values while using setText method solves the problem. I tried that but it did not work.</p>  <p>To solve animation issue I tried to use android:hardwareAccelerated="true" in AndroidManifest file. It did not work as well. </p>  <p>At other test devices, my application works perfectly fine also at another Android Lollipop device. Problematic activity has lots of views and layouts.</p>  <p>Sorry for my bad english.</p>
