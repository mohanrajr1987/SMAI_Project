<p>So I am still quiet the novice when it comes to programming but I was curious as to what would be the best practice to making a formula sheet. Of course it'll be just straight words, letters and numbers in the layout but some of those math formulas have a lot of characters that wouldn't be able to be read by the textview. So should I just make screenshots of formulas I make on word or is that too much memory to waste. Also to zoom in and out how do I go about that. </p>
