<p>I have an array of Strings that I want to display within a proper format for my TextViews. I have already looked at using the Html.fromHtml() approach as posted <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3543454/subscript-and-superscript-a-string-in-android">here</a> but I still can't figure out my specific solution.</p>  <p>The issue that I encounter is I am not sure how to format just a portion of the string.  The "^" char should be a super script  and the "_" underscore should be a subscript. Anything within brackets "{}" means that the superscript/subscript should apply to everything within it. </p>  <p>For example: The string  <strong>^2S_{1/2}</strong> should be displayed as: <strong><sup>2</sup>S<sub><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></sub></strong></p>  <p>Another example: <strong>1s^2</strong> should be formatted within a textview to appear as such: <strong>1S<sup>2</sup></strong></p>  <p>I have been stumped for the past couple hours. All help is appreciated. Thank you!</p>
