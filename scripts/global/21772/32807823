<p>I have a scrollview wrappng a number of subviews including text view.</p>  <p>When running the app I am Having problems getting scrolling focus on the parent scrollview and on the textView, that is it confusing for the user when trying to scroll the textview as sometimes the entire view will scroll instead.</p>  <p>So I want to disable the scrollview when the textview is fully visible, so only the textview will scroll when user interacts with screen.</p>  <pre><code>// Set scrollview size in viewDidLoad and viewDidAppear scrollView.contentSize = CGSize(self.view.frame.width, 1050);  </code></pre>  <p>Any input appreciated.</p>
