<p>I am having an issue with my DHCP Config and am a little confused how DHCP 43 works at this point.  I have a DHCP Server supplying IP Addresses and a Image File and BootFile name.  The BootFile name works fine.  But I can't seem to get DHCP 43/Firmware Upload to work.</p>  <p>Below is my the part of my script that defines the option space and Firmware information.  This is on an HP Switch.</p>  <p>Can anyone point me in the right direction on what syntax I may be using wrong?</p>  <pre><code>option tftp66 code 66 = String; option BootFile code 67 = string; option vendor-class-identifier code 60 = string;  option space ImageFile; option ImageFile.fw code 145 = string;  class "J9779A" {  match if option vendor-class-identifier = "HP J9779A 2530-24-PoEP Switch";  option tftp66 "X.X.X.X";  vendor-option-space ImageFile;  option ImageFile.fw "j9779a.swi";  #option BootFile "configs/base_j9779a.cfg";  allow booting;  allow bootp; } </code></pre>  <p>As far as I can tell from the below HP Link, I am setting this up correctly:</p>  <p><a href="http://h20195.www2.hp.com/v2/getpdf.aspx/4AA5-7850ENW.pdf?ver=1.0" rel="nofollow">http://h20195.www2.hp.com/v2/getpdf.aspx/4AA5-7850ENW.pdf?ver=1.0</a></p>  <p>Just as a note, I took out any IP References, but I can confirm that if I run the TFTP command manually it does upload the firmware from this IP setup, so it doesn't appear to be a networking issue but a DHCP Syntax issue.</p>
