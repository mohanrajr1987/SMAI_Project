<p><strong>Scenario</strong></p>  <p>Laptop A: I have a perl script that automates FTP/Upload download. Let me call it <strong>ftp_script.pl</strong>. I just run this script and it does the rest. </p>  <p>System B: Now, say I am at a different location. I want to trigger this perl script(ftp_script.pl) remotely from Laptop B(from my home) <strong>only using perl script</strong>. I want to know <em>what are possible ways to trigger a perl script using another perl script</em>?   </p>  <p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>  <ol> <li>I want to start a Perl script (say ftp_script.pl) sitting from my home to a remote system (located in office) whose public IP I know. </li> <li>I want to start a Perl script (say ftp_script.pl) from one laptop to other connected over <strong>LAN via hub</strong>. </li> </ol>  <p>Is this possible to achieve? </p>  <p>PS: I don't know much about Perl scripting. </p>
