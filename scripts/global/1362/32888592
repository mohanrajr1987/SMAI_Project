<p>I'm completely new to C# and the .NET framework so forgive me if this is a silly question. </p>  <p>Is there any way of viewing a list of all of the events that have happened on a Windows system as a result of keystrokes and mouse movements etc.? So for example when I click on the Start menu, the Start menu is displayed or when I click the "Apply" button within a settings sub-menu, the settings are applied. </p>  <p>Is there any part of the .NET framework that will allow me to view all of these events/actions and record them via a C# program? Any help would me greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance.</p>
