<p>I am working on a project where I need to download the end of day data from the stock exchange and then compare the data with our caches. There are several exchanges which gives you a direct link to the download URL of the EOD data, however there are others who don't give a direct link for example <a href="https://www.euronext.com/en/equities/directory" rel="nofollow">link to euronext delayed market data</a>  </p>  <p>One has to go to the download link choose the format and click on go button to download the file. Is there any way I could automate this using some tool. I am on the linux platform and x window is disabled. Can somebody please give me some pointers on where to look.</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
