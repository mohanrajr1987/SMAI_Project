<pre><code>driver.findElement(By.xpath("xxxx")).click(); </code></pre>  <p>Clicking on the above link will take to another page. But it will take long time. So while trying to find an element in the resulting page shows an error.</p>  <pre><code>driver.findElement(By.xpath("yy")).getText(); </code></pre>  <p>I have tried Implicit and Explicit Waits, but it is not working everytime.</p>
