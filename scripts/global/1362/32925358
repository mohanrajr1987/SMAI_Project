<p>I'm writing a C# program to automate filling out a web form. Eveything is going good except for the fact that I need to click a certain radio button on the web page.</p>  <p>There are two radio buttons in the group; lets say the id is "months". the first radio button is checked by default, but I need the second one checked. How do I acomplish this? I can see that they each have a different value associated with them, but I'm sure if or how to exploit this to acomplish what I need.</p>
