<p>I am automating an app using UI Testing in Xcode 7.  I have a scrollview with XCUIElements (including buttons, etc) all the way down it.  Sometimes the XCUIElements are visible, sometimes they hidden too far up or down the scrollview (depending on where I am on the scrollview).</p>  <p>Is there a way to scroll items into view or maybe tell if they are visible or not? </p>  <p>Thanks</p>
