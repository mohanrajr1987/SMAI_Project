<p>I would like to learn how to make some home automation, and for this, I think nothing is better than completing a simple and cool personal project.  Here is what i would like to do :  -lights in my bedroom turn on when i come back to home; turns off when i leave the house.  -a chosen music from youtube is played as well when i come back home.Turn off when i go out.<br> -maybe a simple software/app to control light or choose music from another input device such as computer or iphone.</p>  <p>What i think i need to do :  -connect the multi plug that is connecting all the light to some kind of embedded system such as a arduino? i think it is overkill to use an arduino, so should i just make also the circuit board? would love to learn how to!  -use a movement sensor to detect any entry from/out to house. </p>  <p>I am open to any resources or books or videos to guide me into the right direction. Thank you very much! </p>
