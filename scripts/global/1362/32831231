<p>I am using a test project which has 2 test suites. First Test Suite has state dependent steps like  Address Test Case -  Given request is made with an  Address When response with a valid address is received Then do necessary action  Address Test Case -   Address Test Case -  The address for each test case is set at test case level. Each individual step has a script that calls other library test suite &amp; then calls a basic test step in that test suite and passes the parameters to that test case. So Given step in first test suite is as below:</p>  <pre><code>def proj= null def workspace = testRunner.testCase.testSuite.project.getWorkspace(); proj= workspace.getProjectByName("ABC") def testCase = proj.testSuites["ABC Library"].testCases["Successful ABC Steps" ] testRunner.testCase.setPropertyValue( "addressLine1", "1111 Winters Chapel Rd NW, Atlanta, GA 30360" ) testRunner.testCase.setPropertyValue( "city", "Atlanta" ) testRunner.testCase.setPropertyValue( "state", "GA" ) def testStep = testCase.getTestStepByName("Given a request with a valid address is made") def runner = null runner = testStep.run(testRunner, context) </code></pre>  <p>and the corresponding step in library has below as part of the request and actual webservice end point:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;address xsi:type="ns:USPostalAddress"&gt; &lt;ns:addressLine1&gt;${#TestCase#addressLine1}&lt;/ns:addressLine1&gt; &lt;ns:city&gt;${#TestCase#city}&lt;/ns:city&gt; &lt;ns:state&gt; &lt;ns:name&gt;${#TestCase#state}&lt;/ns:name&gt; &lt;/ns:state&gt; &lt;/address&gt; </code></pre>  <p>This test case works fine in SoapUi, but when trying to run through java, I am not able to pass the parameters for a test step from a test suite to other test step in another test suite in the same project xml. Also since the first test step is a script, it just tells runner status is INITIALIZED but how do I get the request xml and response xml which are actually called in the internally called test step. Please help. Thanks in advance...</p>
