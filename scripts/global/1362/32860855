<p>I need to "industrialize" screenshot taking on iOS device with a lot of apps. Everyday, I have to take these screenshots, it's really boring.</p>  <p>For each app, I need to :</p>  <ol> <li>launch the app</li> <li>wait few seconds to be sure that the app is really loaded</li> <li>emulate button clicking</li> <li>take a screenshot</li> <li>close the app</li> </ol>  <p>After that, I need to send these screenshots to my Macbook (but it seems to be simple ..).</p>  <p>This tool could take some screenshots : <a href="https://github.com/KrauseFx/snapshot" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/KrauseFx/snapshot</a> but, I don't have the apps sources. Moreover, I can't open Automator on my iPhone (it would be too simple ..).</p>  <p>If you have any ideas to help me ... Thank you so much!</p>
