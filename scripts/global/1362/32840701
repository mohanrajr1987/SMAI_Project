<p>I've configured jenkins with these steps. It gives the code coverage by unit test given by developer if unit tests are executed. My question is how can I get the code coverage by executing my regression tests which are configured in Post Step.</p>  <p>Pre Steps: Configuring development environment, like changing some values in configs. Pre-Build Step: <code>clean install -fae -Pcode-coverage -DskipTests</code> using maven Post Step: Execute Shell -<code>/var/lib/jenkins/qascripting/Vdopia_Automation/exe/hudson_tc_execute.sh</code> to trigger my regression test</p>
