<p>I have an iPhone and Android application developed using hybrid (phonegap). We are using appium to automate our test cases. In about 3 months or so, our long term road map is to migrate this application to native iOS and Android code for the same UI experience &amp; functionality. Would our automation work be reusable after migration? how much of a rework we'll have to do while switching? I'm concerned if our current automation code will become a throw-away stuff?? please advise.</p>
