<p>I have to backup and delete old log files every month. I will delete files older than 6 months and backup files older than 2 months in as a zip file. I am trying to write a script that will automate and do it every month instead of me doing it manually every time. I have UNIX commands on how to do it, but I need to put it into script file which will run automatically on the day specified.</p>
