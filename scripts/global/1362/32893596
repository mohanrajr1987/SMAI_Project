<p>I'm trying to learn J-Meter.</p>  <p>When I'm running a sample script of logging into a site using both valid/invalid credentials,it doesn't stop thread execution when invalid login credential is used and also login is not recorded in database.</p>  <p>Does it actually login to the website or only creates virtual login to create a similar environment.Is there any way to achieve this  using Samplers?</p>
