<p>I am using nightwatchJS for browser automation. One common usecase I am seeing is, most of the content in my webpage are updated through data from ajax call. So, in my testing, i am looking for a way to hold my testing until i get result from Ajax. I could not find any api in nightwatch or selenium for this.</p>  <p>I have tried with <code>waitForElementVisible</code>, but I feel this will not be suffice. What will happen if my ajax call doesn't return any data.</p>  <p>Has anybody tried this before?</p>
