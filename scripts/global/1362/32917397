<p>So far all I have is the empty grid From what I understand, I will have to have two arrays (though I'm not sure how to implement that) </p>  <pre><code>    char array[30][50] = {{"  "}};      for (int row = 0; row &lt; 20; row++)    {          for (int column = 0; column &lt; 40; column++)       {           std::cout &lt;&lt; array[row][column] &lt;&lt; "  ";       }        std::cout &lt;&lt; std::endl;   }      std::cout &lt;&lt; std::endl; </code></pre>  <ul> <li>User has to pick the starting point on the grid </li> <li>User has to pick one of 3 patterns (oscillator, glider, glider cannon)</li> </ul>  <p>Where do I even begin deconstructing this problem?  Do I create a "cell" class and evaluate each cell to be alive or dead?  How do I pass the initial pattern? </p>
