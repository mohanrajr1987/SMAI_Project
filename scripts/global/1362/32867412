<p>I have a template presentation on powerpoint. I would like to replace automatically generic placeholders with the value I input in an linked excel worksheet.</p>  <p>I started looking at VBA at the begining of the week, I am not really yet familiar with the syntax, but I am optimistic I will find a way to understand it.</p>  <p>I have put "[  ]" everywhere I want a value input: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/feXyi.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/feXyi.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>the excel sheet present itself like this: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/6Ayjx.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/6Ayjx.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I would like to have some pointers (first, to know if it is indeed possible in powerpoint) to get me started in the right direction.</p>  <p>Does it need to be a PublicSub()? Am I writing the macro on Powerpoint or in Excel?</p>  <p>Can I use a fonction similar to LookupV to get the values to replace the placeholders?</p>  <p>I would imagine something like :</p>  <p>(side question : can I use regex inside of VBA?)</p>  <pre><code>for each "\[.\]" '(or characterString.startsWith("[") lookup characterString in excel, return column 3 end each </code></pre>  <p>Would this be possible?</p>  <p>Thank you in advance, I really appreciate the help.</p>
