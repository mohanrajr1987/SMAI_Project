<p>I have created the following table:</p>  <pre><code>CREATE TABLE GUID(guid BINARY(16),user VARCHAR(16),expire INT(10)); </code></pre>  <p>My goal is to create a default guid if a row has a guid = null. To do this, I am creating a trigger:</p>  <pre><code>CREATE TRIGGER default_guid  BEFORE INSERT ON GUID FOR EACH ROW BEGIN IF new.guid IS NULL THEN SET new.guid = UNHEX(REPLACE(UUID(), '-', '')); END IF; END; </code></pre>  <p>However, I receive the following syntax error when creating this trigger:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>ERROR 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the   manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right   syntax to use near '' at line 5</p> </blockquote>  <p>I have tried several online syntax checkers with no luck; where is my syntax error?</p>
