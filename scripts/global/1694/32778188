<p>I am using GNU Libs GCOV, and LCOV in SystemC for code coverage analysis. Everything works fine, but I was wondering if it's possible to have trigger points? just like oscilloscope has a trigger option, which captures the state at the trigger point. I want to capture the coverage report at that particular instance, more like a footprint if that's the right term.</p>  <p>Or if it's not possible, is it possible to have a coverage report at a particular time instance?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
