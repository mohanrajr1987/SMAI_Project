<p>I have the following trigger</p>  <pre><code>CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER TRG_RESUME_AFTER_UPDATE BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON RESUME FOR EACH ROW BEGIN     :new.modified_date := SYSTIMESTAMP; END; </code></pre>  <p>Which compiles </p>  <pre><code>TRIGGER TRG_RESUME_AFTER_UPDATE compiled </code></pre>  <p>However when I try an insert I get the following error:</p>  <pre><code>Error at Command Line : 11 Column : 8 Error report - SQL Error: ORA-04098: trigger 'D.TRG_RESUME_AFTER_UPDATE' is invalid and failed re-validation 04098. 00000 -  "trigger '%s.%s' is invalid and failed re-validation" *Cause:    A trigger was attempted to be retrieved for execution and was            found to be invalid.  This also means that compilation/authorization            failed for the trigger. *Action:   Options are to resolve the compilation/authorization errors,            disable the trigger, or drop the trigger. </code></pre>
