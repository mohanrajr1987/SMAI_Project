<p>How can a function in Javascript play an audio file or trigger an audio file to play? I'm trying to play a file using Javascript and when the audio file is done playing -- have the page reload.</p>  <p>I was able to detect when an audio file stopped playing by using this:</p>  <p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false"> <div class="snippet-code"> <pre class="snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override"><code>&lt;audio src="1.wav" controls="true" onended="window.location.reload()" autoplay="true"&gt;&lt;/audio&gt; </code></pre> </div> </div> </p>  <p>Is there any way to have Javascript instantiate this  component and therefore have it play? That would be great.</p>
