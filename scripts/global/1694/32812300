<p>I have a final project for a MySQL class so I have the following requests:</p>  <p>I have a table called tab_interm with the following columns:</p>  <pre><code>DateVisit varchar(50), hourentering time, SnamePatient varchar(100), FnamePatient varchar(100), SNameDoctors varchar(100), FnameDoctors varchar(100), Cabinet varchar(100)); </code></pre>  <p>The data for populating this table are in a file.txt.</p>  <p>So I have to create a trigger which populates the following tables: </p>  <pre><code>Pacients (id_pacient int auto_increment PK, Sname varchar(50), fname varchar(50)) Cabinets (id_cabinet int auto_increment PK, name) and  visits (datehourvisits datetime, id_doctor, id_patient, id_cabinet, last 3 being FK). </code></pre>  <p>The table doctors (id_doctor, sname, fname) is already populated.</p>  <p>The FK in visits will be populated using last_insert_id().</p>  <p>The trigger will also call a stored function that will transform datavisit and hourentering into a datetime column (probably with str_to_date and concat) Also I have to declare a continue handler which is activated when a duplicated value is inserted.</p>  <p>I really don't know how to start this trigger. Maybe you will have an idea... thank you.</p>
