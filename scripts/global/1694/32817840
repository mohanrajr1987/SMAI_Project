<p>I have two SQL Server tables,</p>  <ul> <li>the first one is populated by a web service </li> <li>and the second one is used by a software that our company uses for the customer registries. </li> </ul>  <p>Right now I have a stored procedure, scheduled in a SQL Server Agent job, which takes all new entries from the table 1, prepares them and inserts them into a table 2. </p>  <p>This job runs once a day and works fine. But I need to do this more often. The web service is not used so often  but I need to do an insert in table 2 every time a person uses the web service. </p>  <p>First, I planned to schedule the existing job every 2 minutes, just to check if there are any new rows. But I am not sure if that’s OK for performance of the server? </p>  <p>Then I thought about SQL Server triggers which I haven't use before. I wrote an "after insert" trigger to start the existing SQL Server job but, then the web service stopped working. The web service checks the unique e-mail address. </p>  <p>If I understood triggers right, the trigger will generate a new "inserted table", so every time a user wants to register in the web service and the trigger is active, the user gets the error message "the e-mail address is already in use". </p>  <p>I can’t change the structure of tables or the logic of the web service. I have to adapt the data from table 1 to fit into table 2 so I can’t use replication either. </p>  <p>I would appreciate if you could give me some ideas, how to solve the problem with the trigger or if there's another solution I could use?</p>  <p>Thank you in advance!</p>
