<p>I have on tables triggers that holds logs of update and delete on records. SYSTEM_USER will return the SSPI user that is current triggering but I also have a table that holds a user and password information to protect a little bit the interface, like a windows form with username password form. simple as that but impossible to sent this user to the trigger. So, the deal is that I save on "from_pc" or whatever the SYSTEM_USER (like:domainname/myusername) and the "user_login" from a prompted SSPI.</p>  <p>If I'm a little bit too confusing I'm going to explain in a simple way down here:</p>  <ul> <li>PC1 has a ABCD C# interface with SQL Server connection (remote).</li> <li>PC1 is logged on domain with user aguy.lastname</li> <li>Another person using aguy.lastname session on that PC1 will open the ABCD C# program and use it. But here will prompt SSPI to ask the username and password.</li> <li>Now the PC1 is logged as aguy.lastname and the other person is "logged" on SQL Server with his username and password from Active Directory.</li> </ul>  <p>If I could this it will make the logs more trustworthy. I could track the real person doing stuff on data base rather than only the PC because if a person deletes a record it will be logged the user from PC1 as the one who deleted the record. I think you guys get the point I'm trying to explain.</p>  <p>edit: I found this: <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd401714%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd401714%28v=vs.85%29.aspx</a> I need to make sure that I can get the season opened. I'm a little bit lost right now.</p>  <p>edit 2: So, I have a SQL Connection string like this:</p>  <pre><code>Data Source=arandomserver;Initial Catalog=dbIwantTo;Integrated Security=True </code></pre>  <p>In this string there isn't a option that prompts a network dialog based authentication like in RDP to connect?</p>
