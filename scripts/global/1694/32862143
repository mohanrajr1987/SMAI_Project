<p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/6gwGG.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/6gwGG.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>When UPDATE statement is entered a trigger is activated so that at the end the both the original and updated rows kept and can be displayed if the user wants to.</p>  <p>The orignal row's (Edited marked as Y) values are correct but the updated row (Edited marked as NULL) should have the <code>CreationDate</code> same as the orignal row's <code>ModificationDate</code>, not the <code>CreationDate</code>. How do I fix it?</p>  <pre><code>CREATE TRIGGER CloneAfterUpdate ON ProcessList AFTER UPDATE AS  IF (UPDATE(Amount) OR UPDATE(Name)) BEGIN    INSERT INTO ProcessListHist (            ID,            Name,            Amount,            CreationDate,            Edited,            ModificationDate)    SELECT        ID, Name, Amount, CreationDate, 'Y', GETDATE()     FROM deleted END </code></pre>  <p>Trigger being called when executing this T-SQL:</p>  <pre><code>UPDATE ProcessList  SET Amount = 23000  WHERE Name = 'Tammy'  SELECT *  FROM ProcessList   UNION ALL   SELECT *  FROM ProcessListHist  ORDER BY ID ASC, CreationDate ASC </code></pre>
