<p>I am using postgresql. I have two schemas <code>main</code> and <code>sec</code> containing only one table <code>datastore</code> with the same structure (this is only an extract) I am trying unsucessfully to create a trigger for keep sync both tables when insert occurs in one of them. The problem is some kind of circular or recursive reference.</p>  <p>Can you create some example for solve this?</p>  <p>I am working on this, I'll post my solution later. You can use this code as reference for creating schemas and tables</p>  <pre><code>    CREATE SCHEMA main;     CREATE SCHEMA sec;     SET search_path = main, pg_catalog;     CREATE TABLE datastore (         fullname character varying,         age integer     );     SET search_path = sec, pg_catalog;     CREATE TABLE datastore (         fullname character varying,         age integer     ); </code></pre>
