<p>If you run the following code snippet below the trigger on the table is invoked when a clumn is dropped which had been added after the table creation and has a default value and not null defined. This is behaviour I could only reproduce in Oracle 11.2.0.4.0 but not in 11.2.0.3.0. COuld somebody please help me with this? Is this expected behaviour? How can I drop the column without running the trigger?</p>  <pre><code>CREATE TABLE T (     DESCRIPTION VARCHAR2(50) );  INSERT INTO T (DESCRIPTION) VALUES ('asd');  COMMIT;  CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER BEFORE_T_U     BEFORE UPDATE ON T     REFERENCING OLD AS OLD NEW AS NEW     FOR EACH ROW BEGIN     RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20003, 'This before update trigger should not be invoked!'); END BEFORE_T_U; /  ALTER TABLE T ADD AMOUNT NUMBER DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL;  ALTER TABLE T DROP COLUMN AMOUNT; </code></pre>
