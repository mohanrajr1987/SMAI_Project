<p>I've a table named "tabella" and i must to divide this table yearly. So i've same table repeated for each year...something like tab_2014, tab_2015, etc..</p>  <p>I must to trigger a copy of data, in this tables... So if i do this, it works:</p>  <pre><code>BEGIN IF YEAR(NEW.data) = 2014 THEN     INSERT INTO tab_2014 SELECT * FROM tabella WHERE id = NEW.id; ELSEIF YEAR(NEW.data) = 2015 THEN     INSERT INTO tab_2015 SELECT * FROM tabella WHERE id = NEW.id; END IF; END; </code></pre>  <p>But in this case i must to do an "IF" statement for each year..</p>  <p>If I do something like this, it doesn't work:</p>  <pre><code>BEGIN  INSERT INTO CONCAT("tab_", YEAR(NEW.data)) SELECT * FROM tabella WHERE id = NEW.id; END; </code></pre>  <p>How can I do?</p>
