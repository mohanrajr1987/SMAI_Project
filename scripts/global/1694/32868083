<p>I would like to get all field values in a SELECT in <strong>one</strong> comma separated text field. When I know the fields beforehand I could just use :</p>  <pre><code>SELECT CONCAT(Field1, Field2, Field3) FROM items </code></pre>  <p>but now I'm wondering if it's possible to do something like :</p>  <pre><code>SELECT CONCAT(*) FROM items </code></pre>  <p>I know how to use INFORMATION_SCHEMA to get all fieldnames, but I can't use these in a SELECT (without using prepared statements, which I need to avoid since I need this inside a trigger).</p>  <p>Any ideas?</p>
