<p>I am working making a table and its supporting tables full text searchable in Posgtres.</p>  <p>Here's my function</p>  <pre><code>CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION on_customer_save_udpate_tsv() RETURNS trigger AS $$  declare     tsv_text text;  begin  SELECT string_agg(cust_text.text, ' ') as agg_text into tsv_text  FROM (SELECT (NEW.name || ' ' || NEW.phone) AS text    UNION     SELECT concat("firstName", ' ', "lastName", ' ', "phone", ' ', "email") as text     FROM "Contacts"     where "customerId" = NEW.id     UNION     SELECT concat("streetLine1", ' ', "city", ' ', "state", ' ', "zip") as text     FROM "Addresses"     where "customerId" = NEW.id) cust_text;  NEW.tsv := to_tsvector(coalesce(tsv_text,''));  return NEW;  end  $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;  </code></pre>  <p>And here's my trigger:</p>  <pre><code>CREATE TRIGGER cust_tsv_trigger BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE  ON "Customers" FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE on_customer_save_udpate_tsv(); </code></pre>  <p>This is working, but I need to apply triggers to the <code>Contacts</code> and <code>Addresses</code> tables to keep the tsv column current. It seems like I'm going to end up with triggers kicking off triggers. In addition I would need a variation of this function for each table as well. </p>  <p>How can I avoid this? Is it possible to move the tsvector column to a view and drop the triggers all together?</p>
