<p><strong>Context</strong></p>  <p>I insert a Hex string in database table(say rawData) via multithreaded windows service(this windows services can heavily inserts into rawData at rate say 100 records/min and all threads may have different time intervals to insert data), then I need to parse and convert the hex string and insert the values into other tables(say parsedData1, parsedData2, etc) depending upon various factors.</p>  <p>whenever a record is inserted into the table, immediately my service or trigger should kick off</p>  <p><strong>Questions</strong></p>  <ul> <li>Which would be performance effective Trigger or Windows Service using C# or any other way.</li> <li>Considering windows service using C#, how do I check the database each and every time if record is present in the table? do I need a timer of xx miliseconds and check after the interval?</li> </ul>  <p>Thanks for the Help..</p>
