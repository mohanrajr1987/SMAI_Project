<p>i'm trying to set up a dependency between to jobs in the Talend Administration Center. When the first job is finished the second job should start. I don't want to implement it by tRunJob componenten in one of the jobs. That's why i have set up a file trigger. At the end of the first job, he creates a file in a specified directory. Im not sure at which root directory the file would be search. I've set up the path but he doesn't start the trigger. Does someone have any experience with that? Or is there an other possibility to set up such an dependency?</p>  <p>Cheers.</p>
