<p>For example, in Perl you delimit a variable like so:</p>  <pre><code>${foo}_bar </code></pre>  <p>I have a trigger in PostgreSQL borrowed from <a href="https://coderwall.com/p/whf3-a/hierarchical-data-in-postgres" rel="nofollow">here</a> that I am trying to make generic to work with multiple tables. Here's my code:</p>  <pre><code>CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_parent_path() RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$ DECLARE     PATH ltree; BEGIN     IF NEW.parent_id IS NULL THEN         NEW.parent_path = 'root'::ltree;     ELSEIF TG_OP = 'INSERT' OR OLD.parent_id IS NULL OR OLD.parent_id != NEW.parent_id THEN         SELECT parent_path || TG_TABLE_NAME_id::text FROM TG_TABLE_NAME WHERE TG_TABLE_NAME_id = NEW.parent_id INTO PATH;         IF PATH IS NULL THEN             RAISE EXCEPTION 'Invalid parent_id %', NEW.parent_id;         END IF;         NEW.parent_path = PATH;     END IF;     RETURN NEW; END; $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql; </code></pre>  <p>Each table that I am using this trigger against has a primary key like table_id (e.g., skill_id, level_id, etc). What I am trying to do is say <code>WHERE skill_id = NEW.parent_id</code> (for whatever table it's called against), thus the reason I am saying <code>WHERE TG_TABLE_NAME_id = NEW.parent_id</code>. What I'm wondering is how do I delimit TG_TABLE_NAME (trigger procedure) from _id?</p>  <p>Or, is there a better way to do this? Maybe I'm just going about this all wrong.</p>
