<p>I have a read-only view access to a database server s1. Now I'm creating a new database server of my own and I want to update this new database whenever s1 is updated with new entries. I understand that triggers can be executed when both the databases are in the same server but in my case and given my constraints, is it possible to do this?</p>  <p>To follow up: How can I call a python script on a database trigger event?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
