<p>I am parsing a file and pulling data out of it. One of the pieces of data is a decimal such as 1.9.</p>  <p>For some reason when I tried to save to my MySQL table it kept saving as 0. The field type is Decimal (6,2) in the table.</p>  <p>I attempted to manually cast it using various php functions such as...</p>  <p>settype(), (int), (float), (double) etc. Everytime I cast it, it would set it to zero or boolean. I used gettype to check it.</p>  <p>When parsing it I used trim() and str_replace() functions to remove spaces. What is odd is that I am using same method for pulling other values/decimals out of same file and php handled the casing itself.</p>  <p>Any ideas what could possible prevent me from casting this as a a number?</p>
