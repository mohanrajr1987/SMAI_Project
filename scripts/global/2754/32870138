<p>I have a set of about 200 unique ID's from a revenue batch that I need to run a stored procedure against. My idea was to create a temp table, insert the unique values, run the stored proc against the temp table and drop the temp table. However whenever I execute my code I am receiving the error message "Conversion failed when converting from a character string to uniqueidentifier." I can not figure out why I am getting this error. Is anyone familiar with this error that could possibly help me out? Can you look at my code and see the reason for this message? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Code Below with sample size unique ID's:</p>  <pre><code>CREATE TABLE #Removal (RevID uniqueidentifier, LUID char (12)) INSERT  INTO #Removal(RevID, LUID)VALUES (Cast ('rev-55326898'AS uniqueidentifier), '8-11838757'),(Cast ('rev-55326899'AS uniqueidentifier), '8-16960881') declare @field1 uniqueidentifier declare @field2 INT declare cur CURSOR LOCAL for select RevID from #Removal Open cur fetch next from cur into @field1 while @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN exec USP_REVENUE_DELETE @field1, @field2 fetch next from cur into @field1 End Close cur deallocate cur Drop table #Removal </code></pre>
