<p>Good afternoon, all!</p>  <p>Trying to get temperature off a database on my SQL server stored as "78.3 F" and make it only the number "78.3".  The database has this field as nvarchar.  I tried:</p>  <pre><code>select Cast(Left(Paint_Environ.Booth1_Temp, Len(Paint_Environ.Booth1_Temp) - 2) As NUMERIC(4,1)) As Temp from Paint_Environ </code></pre>  <p>but get an errors saying "Error converting data type nvarchar to numeric"  Is there a better way to convert nvarchar to something numeric???</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>  <p>Matt</p>
