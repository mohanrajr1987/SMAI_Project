<p>I'm working on a Lab assignment for my introduction to C programming class and we're learning about casting.</p>  <p>As part of an exercise I had to write this program and explain the casting that happens in each exercise:</p>  <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;  int main(void) {   int a = 2, b = 3;   float f = 2.5;   double d = -1.2;   int int_result;   float real_result;    // exercise 1   int_result = a * f;   printf("%d\n", int_result);    // exercise 2   real_result = a * f;   printf("%f\n", real_result);    // exercise 3   real_result = (float) a * b;   printf("%f\n", real_result);    // exercise 4   d = a + b / a * f;   printf("%d\n", d);    // exercise 5   d = f * b / a + a;   printf("%d\n", d);    return 0; } </code></pre>  <p>I get the following output:</p>  <pre><code>5 5.000000 6.000000 1074921472 1075249152 </code></pre>  <p>For the last two outputs, the mathematical operations that are conducted result in float values. Since the variable they're being stored in is of the type double, the cast from float to double shouldn't affect the values, should it? But when I print out the value of <code>d</code>, I get garbage numbers as shown in the output.</p>  <p>Could someone please explain?</p>
