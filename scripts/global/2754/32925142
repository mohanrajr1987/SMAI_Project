<pre><code>short x, y;  short z = ((short)x) + ((short)y);  </code></pre>  <p>So I understand that in Java that a value is considered an integer when it is added. It's just one of the nuances in the language. However, here, I am already casting <code>short</code> to the variables <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> and it still gives me an error saying that</p>  <blockquote>   <p>can't convert from int to short</p> </blockquote>
