<p>I have a line in a code which became deprecated, there are suggestions in XCode what to replace it with, but I can't get my head around the difference, these are my three lines which worked:</p>  <pre><code>let path = NSBundle.mainBundle().pathForResource("example", ofType: ".p12") let pkcs12Data = NSData.dataWithContentsOfMappedFile(path!) let cf: CFDataRef = pkcs12Data as! CFDataRef </code></pre>  <p>Now according to warning and suggestions I changed my code to:</p>  <pre><code>let path = NSBundle.mainBundle().pathForResource("example", ofType: ".p12") let pkcs12Data = NSData(contentsOfFile: path!) let cf: CFDataRef = pkcs12Data as! CFDataRef </code></pre>  <p>Which gives me an error:</p>  <pre><code>EXC_BAD_INSTRUCTION (CODE=EXC_I386_INVOP SUBCODE=0x0) </code></pre>
