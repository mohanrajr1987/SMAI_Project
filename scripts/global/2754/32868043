<p>I have several named ranges inside my Excel sheet where I store data for VBA Macros between sessions. When loading I need to get that data into multiple arrays (<code>String</code> and <code>Booleans</code>).</p>  <pre><code>Dim arr() As Variant Dim rg As Range  Set rg = Sheets("Calc").Range("myRange") arr = rg.Value2 </code></pre>  <p>How can I typecast <code>arr()</code> into a <code>String</code> or <code>Boolean</code> array for use in my macro? </p>  <p>If I try and use <code>Variant</code> arrays instead I get <code>ByRef argument mismatch errors</code> on function calls. </p>  <p>Or Is there maybe another way to get the contents of the ranges into an array of other type than <code>Variant</code>? </p>  <p>Searching did not yield a result on the latter question.</p>
