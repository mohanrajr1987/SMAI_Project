<p>The backstory. In VBA in Excel I created a function that calculate the shortest distance between two lines (vectors). This function returns the apparent intersection point, and the actual distance between them. To make this work I ended up passing out an array, then sorting out what went where afterwards. It works, but is clunky to read and work with.</p>  <p>In C++ i have made a similar function that returns the point in question.</p>  <pre><code>struct point3D {  double x,y,z; } point3D findIntersect(const vec3&amp; vector1, const vec3&amp; vector2) { // Do stuff... return point; } </code></pre>  <p>The problem: I want to return the length as well, since it uses parts of the original calculation. However most of the time I only want the point.</p>  <p>Possible solutions I have looked at are:</p>  <p>Write a separate function for the distance. A lot of extra work for when I want both of them.</p>  <ul> <li>Create a custom struct for this one function. <em>Seems a bit overkill.</em></li> <li>Return an array like the VBA function did. <em>Resulting code is not very intuitive, and requires care when using.</em></li> <li>Using an optional argument as a reference to a variable to store the distance. <em>Does not work. The compiler does not allow me to change an optional argument.</em> </li> <li>Using an argument list like this <code>function(const argin1, const argin2, argout&amp;, argout2&amp;)</code>. <em>Just ugh! Would require the user to always expect every variable out.</em></li> </ul>  <p>I have seen examples with pairs, but the they look like they have to be the same data type. I essentially want to return a <code>point3D</code>, and a <code>double</code>.</p>  <p>Does anyone have a more elegant solution to returning multiple values from a function?</p>
