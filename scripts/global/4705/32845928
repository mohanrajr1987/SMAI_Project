<p>I am new to programming and having trouble returning a desired result from a function. The result passed back is always the initialized variable that was passed in. </p>  <p>I have tried several different ways of declaring, changing variable names, and creating static member variables. </p>  <p>There is a problem with my syntax for sure, and I could use help in locating it. </p>  <p>Thanks is advance. </p>  <pre><code>package chapter4;  public class FunctionDieRoll {     static int dieOne;     static int dieTwo;     static int totalRoll;      public static void main(String[] args) {         numRolls(2);         System.out.println(totalRoll);      }      static int numRolls(int rolls){         int curRoll = 0;         while (curRoll != rolls){             dieOne = (int)(Math.random()*6 + 1);             dieTwo = (int)(Math.random()*6 + 1);             curRoll = dieOne + dieTwo;             totalRoll++;             System.out.println(curRoll);             System.out.println(totalRoll);         }         return totalRoll;     }  } </code></pre>
