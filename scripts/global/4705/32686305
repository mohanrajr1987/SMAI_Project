<p>I have a method in a java class that returns a two dimensional array of integers. is there a "return" like statement that returns something but does not terminate the method call but instead pauses it instead until the next time it is called. So it can continue on doing its running with out rewriting it to work with multi threading? </p>  <pre><code>public int foo(){  x = 5; "Return like statement goes here" x; "code continues on from this point" x =*10 return x;} </code></pre>
