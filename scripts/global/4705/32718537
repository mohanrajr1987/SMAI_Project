<p>I'm having trouble with my python code I have been trying to make a maths quiz for my GCSE but I have run across a problem.</p>  <p>The return function is not returning any variables as you can see below I have stated the variables that need to be 'returned' unless I am using the wrong function.</p>  <p>My aim is to have the <code>numgen</code> generate the numbers and the numbers to be then used in the <code>def question</code> to ask the user for the answer and then the <code>def correct</code> to tell the user to if the question is correct. </p>  <pre><code>import random import time Decision = 'neither' print("\n\n\n\n\n\n")  Name = input("Hello what is your name?")  print("...")  time.sleep(1)  print("Hello",Name,"are you ready for the maths quiz?")  while Decision.lower() != "yes" or "no":     Decision = input("Type either\n'yes'\nor\n'no'")      if Decision.lower() == "yes":         print("Ok, we will proceed")         break      elif Decision == "no":         print("Please come back when you are ready")         exit(0)      else:         print("please type again either 'yes' or 'no'")  marks = 0  def numgen():     num1 = random.randint(1,40)     numlist = random.choice(['*','/','+','-'])     num2 = random.randrange(2,20,2)     answer = eval(str(num1) + numlist + str(num2))     return(num1, numlist, num2, answer)  score = 0  def question (num1, numlist,num2, answer):     print("This question is worth 10 marks.")     print ("The question is:",num1, numlist, num2)     Q1 = input('What is your answer?')     Q1 = float(Q1)     return(Q1)  def correct(Q1):     if Q1 == answer:         print("Well done you got it right.")         score = score + 10     else:         print("you were incorrect the asnwer was:",answer)         return (score)  questions = 0 while questions &lt; 10:     numgen()     question(num1,num2,answer,numlist)     correct(Q1)   print(marks) </code></pre>  <p>EDIT: Okay i thank everyone for your help but im still having problems because in this line <code>print ("The question is:",num1, numlist, num2)</code> where <code>num2</code> is, is where for some reason the answer appears i dont know what causes this but  it is very annoying can anyone help. This is after i edited the code to include</p>  <pre><code>num1,num2,numlist,answer=numgen() Q1=question(num1,num2,answer,numlist) score = int(score) score = correct(score, Q1) </code></pre>  <p>so for example if I had:</p>  <p><code>the question is: 24 + 46</code></p>  <p>the answer would be 46. Should I give up on using the  <code>def</code> command? thanks in advance for your help.</p>
