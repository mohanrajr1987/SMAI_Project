<p>I'm trying to use the return function, I'm new to python but it is one of the things I don't seem to understand.</p>  <p>In my assignment I have to put each task in a function to make it easier to read and understand but for example I create a randomly generated number in a function, I then need the same generated number in a different function and I believe the only way this can be done is by returning data. For example here I have a function generating a random number:</p>  <pre><code>def generate():     import random     key = random.randint(22, 35)     print(key) </code></pre>  <p>But if I need to use the variable 'key' again which holds the same random number in a different function, it won't work as it is not defined in the new function.</p>  <pre><code>def generate():     import random     key = random.randint(22, 35)     print(key)  def number():     sum = key + 33 </code></pre>  <p>So how would I return data (if that is what you need to use) for it to work?</p>
