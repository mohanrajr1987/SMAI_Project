<p>I have an <code>NSDictionary</code> which I would like to return the corresponding key nearest zero (including those with negative numbers):</p>  <pre><code>NSDictionary *dict = @{                        @"David" : @-89,                        @"Bobby" : @61,                        @"Nancy" : @-8,                        @"Sarah" : @360,                        @"Steve" : @203                       }; </code></pre>  <p>So in this case <code>Nancy</code> would be closest...  How can I do that? I searched but came up empty. </p>
