<p>Is it possible to know/get how much space/memory are used when a method is executed or when there is a return value? I don't want to know how much space used by the app, just some code like method or the return value. I  tried the runtime.getRuntime, but from my understanding, It looks like it tells me how much space is used by the entire code/app, am I right? </p>  <p>EDIT : </p>  <pre><code>  public int [] randtotal(int times2)     {         int in1[] = new int[times2];         for (int i = 0; i&lt;Num2; i++)         Random rand = new Random();         {             in1[times2]= rand.NextInt(5);         }          totalNum(in1);         return int1;     }    </code></pre>  <p>As you can see here, at the end of the code there is the "return int1;" , so I want to know when these code is executed how much space is allocated for the value here?               </p>
