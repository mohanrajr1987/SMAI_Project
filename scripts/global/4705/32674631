<p>So in my code seg is the typedef name of a structure I made in a header file. The heading of the function is correct -- that was given -- but I am unsure if I am following the wanted return type which is a *seg (or a struct seg pointer).  I get the error: avoid error: expected identifier or ‘(’ before ‘seg’? which I cannot figure out. If anyone could guide me thanks. thanks for the time and help. </p>  <pre><code>*seg  whichseg(int j){     int seg_node_num = (int)ceil(j/(float)BITS_PER_SEG);     int i = 1;     seg *seg_node;     seg_node = (seg*)malloc(sizeOf(seg));     for(seg_node = head; i &lt;= seg_node_num; seg_node = seg_node.next)     {         i++;     }     return seg_node; } </code></pre>  <p>this is the header file sorry for not putting it earlier  '</p>  <pre><code>    typedef struct _seg {  /* definition of new type "seg" */         int  bits[256];         struct _seg  *next,*prev;                   }seg  ;      EXTERN int NSegs;      EXTERN seg *head;  </code></pre>  <p>'</p>
