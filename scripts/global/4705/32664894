<pre><code>for(Element synonym: Words){             synonyms.add(synonym);         }         return synonyms.get(7);         } </code></pre>  <p>i am retrieving an unknown amount of words every time i add a synonym to the synonyms list, so if i try access a portion of the list that doesnt exist (eg. element 7 when there are only 3), i get an index out of bounds error, how can i check to see if the element exists and if it doesn't, return something else?</p>  <p>i have tried checking to see if there is an element or not but i dont know how</p>
