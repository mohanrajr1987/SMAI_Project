<p>I am a beginner in <a href="/questions/tagged/c" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;c&#39;" rel="tag">c</a>. I have a function that returns the length and array of c strings. However, I am having hard time to figure out how to send both as an <code>int</code>. I have tried using <code>void</code> pointers, but compiler generates an error saying that returning a pointer (<code>int</code> expected). Moreover, I have tried implementing the aToI method, but didn't get the required result. I realize that I can only return the array of c strings and get the length of that using <code>strlen()</code> function. However, how can we send an array of c strings as an integer. Please explain with an example. Thanks  Heres what my code looks like</p>  <pre><code>int read_header( char *fileName , char **headerRow ) {     int length= header_columns(fileName);     headerRow[0]=(char*)malloc(length);     FILE *fp;     char c;     char **header;     char *savedheader;     char *returnPointer;     int counter=0;     header[0]=(char*)malloc(Max_Line_Length);     char *pointer=header[0];     while((c=getc(fp))!='\n')     {         if(c!='\n')         {             if(c==',')             {                 length++;             }             *pointer++=c;         }         else         {             length++;             *pointer='\0';          }      }    pointer=strtok_r(pointer,",",&amp;savedheader);     while(pointer!=NULL)     {         headerRow[counter]=pointer;         pointer=strtok_r(pointer,",",&amp;savedheader);         counter++;     }     returnPointer= headerRow[0];     return &amp;returnPointer;   } </code></pre>  <p>I am reading the line of words separated by comma as characters. Then I am parsing those characters as c strings using strtok_r() method. Now, I need to return the headerRow array as an integer to another function.</p>
