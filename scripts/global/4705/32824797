<p>Which of the following would you prefer:</p>  <pre><code>    SomeEnum enum = SomeEnum.SOMETHING;     if (aString.equals(anotherString)) {         enum = SomeEnum.SOMETHING_ELSE;     }     return foo.bar(enum); </code></pre>  <p>or</p>  <pre><code>    if (aString.equals(anotherString)) {         return foo.bar(SomeEnum.SOMETHING_ELSE);     }     return foo.bar(SomeEnum.SOMETHING); </code></pre>  <p>I think I would prefer the first one, because it only has 1 point of return. On the other side I think that the second one is easier to read. What do you think? Maybe you got an even more sophisticated solution.</p>
