<p>In laravel there are files like app.php or auth.php which contains one array with specific settings. For my application i want to create a file that contains all my query's like the same way in one array and return it. How could i use the file for example app.php in my controller</p>  <h1>Example</h1>  <pre><code>return [      /*     |--------------------------------------------------------------------------     | Query 1     |--------------------------------------------------------------------------     |     | This is an example of a query      |     */          'sql_user_by_name' =&gt; "SELECT * FROM user WHERE name = 'test'", ] </code></pre>
