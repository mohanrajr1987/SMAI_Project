<p>I have been encountering a problem. The goal is:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Write a function to generate one random number between 0 and n.  n should be a parameter to the function and the generated random number should be the return value.  THERE SHOULD BE NO CIN AND COUT IN THIS FUNCTION.</p>      <ol start="2">   <li><p>Write a function that computes the average of a series of x random number of random numbers, where x is the total random numbers to generate.  For example if x is 10 then it should compute the average of 10 random numbers and return the average value to the caller.  This function should call the function of task 1 to generate a random number.  The input to this function is x.  THERE SHOULD BE NO CIN AND COUT IN THIS FUNCTION.</p></li>   <li><p>In function main call the function of task 2 to vary the total number of random numbers generated between 0 and n inclusive as 1e1, 1e2, 1e3, 1e4, 1e5, â€¦ 1e10 and print their average.  </p></li>   </ol>      <p>Sample input/ouput:<br/>   input n       (suppose user inputs 20)<br/>   average of 10 random numbers between 0 and 20 is: ...<br/>   average of 100 random numbers between 0 and 20 is: ...<br/>   average of 1000 random numbers between 0 and 20 is: ...<br/>   average of 10000 random numbers between 0 and 20 is: ...<br/>   average of 100000 random numbers between 0 and 20 is: ...<br/>   Repeat your experiment for different values of n.   <br/>   .<br/>   .</p> </blockquote>  <p>here is my code :</p>  <pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt; #include &lt;cstdlib&gt; #include &lt;ctime&gt; #include &lt;cmath&gt; using namespace std; int RandomNumber(int &amp;n) {      {     srand(time(0));       int x = 1+(rand() % (n));     return x;      }  } int average(int &amp;n,int &amp;power,int &amp;lol) {         float sum =0;     int counter = 0;     for(int i=0; i &lt;= pow(10,power);i++)     {      int randnum = RandomNumber(n);       sum = sum + randnum;       lol = lol +1;      }      float average = sum/counter;      return average; } int main() {     int counter = 1;     int count= 1;     int averageofnumbers = 0;     cout&lt;&lt;"Enter the number n  :";     int n = 0;     cin&gt;&gt;n;//30     while(count &lt; 6)     {         int cc = pow(10,count);          averageofnumbers = average(n,count,counter);         cout&lt;&lt;"average of "&lt;&lt;cc&lt;&lt;" Random  Numbers between 0 and  "&lt;&lt;n&lt;&lt; " is : "&lt;&lt;averageofnumbers&lt;&lt;endl;         count = count +1;     }  } </code></pre>  <p>The problem is the function <strong>average</strong> is returning same values each time the loop is being run.  Moreover, it is returning a negative value.</p>
