<p>So I have a quick question about Java.</p>  <p>So in C, some methods (especially the main) look like this:</p>  <pre><code>int main(){     printf("Test");     return 0; } </code></pre>  <p>The int return type as some C developers on here may know shows if the method returns an error or not, with 0 being the return showing that there isn't an error. So I thought, well, if I did something like this as a method in Java:</p>  <pre><code>public int test(){     return 0; } </code></pre>  <p>Would the integer return show that there is/isn't an error returned?</p>
