<p>I am using visual studio online (tfs online). I  have created a build definition using Hosted Build Controller and Hosted Build Agent. I have used a powershell script to assign version number automatically to assembly file or .exe file using TFS build number.</p>  <p>I have followed the following given links for this.</p>  <p><a href="http://geeks.ms/blogs/jlsoria/archive/2014/02/17/get-your-binaries-versioned-automatically-in-less-than-5-minutes-with-tfs-build-2013.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://geeks.ms/blogs/jlsoria/archive/2014/02/17/get-your-binaries-versioned-automatically-in-less-than-5-minutes-with-tfs-build-2013.aspx</a></p>  <p><a href="http://www.colinsalmcorner.com/post/matching-binary-version-to-build-number-version-in-tfs-2013-builds" rel="nofollow">http://www.colinsalmcorner.com/post/matching-binary-version-to-build-number-version-in-tfs-2013-builds</a></p>  <p>But I am unable to assign version to my .exe application. All the time it takes version number from AssemblyInfo.cs file. My purpose is to assign value of TFS build number to my assembly file.</p>  <p>Please help me with this. Thanks,</p>
