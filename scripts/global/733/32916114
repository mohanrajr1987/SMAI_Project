<p>We have TFS 2013, currently for the team project working we don't have any branches, basically just a plain folder structure with various solutions in them.</p>  <p>With the goal to introduce release management, the intention is to create several branche, e.g. development/main/releases</p>  <p>As I was told I cannot 'disturb' the project team developers from their day to day work since there are other projects being worked on, question, what is the best practice to do this? Create a separate team project? How can we adopt the branching practice without asking all the developers.</p>  <p>Please help point a direction for this or share some thought on this, any help is appreciated!!</p>
