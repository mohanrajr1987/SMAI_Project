<p>I'm running some very simple unit tests in TFS 2015 using NUnit and the NUnit Test Adapter NuGet packages but the only way I can get the tests to pass is to restart the TFS service, then the project builds and tests pass <strong>once</strong>. The next time I run it I get the following error.</p>  <pre><code>Build (-1, 0) Exception Message: Access to the path 'C:\Builds\2\RGDAgile\RGD.Common\src\RGD.Common\packages\NUnitTestAdapter.2.0.0\lib\nunit.core.dll' is denied. (type UnauthorizedAccessException) Exception Stack Trace: at System.IO.__Error.WinIOError(Int32 errorCode, String maybeFullPath) at System.IO.File.InternalDelete(String path, Boolean checkHost) at System.IO.File.Delete(String path) at Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Common.FileSpec.DeleteFile(String path, Boolean throwExceptionOnFailure) at Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Common.FileSpec.DeleteDirectoryInternal(String path) at Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Common.FileSpec.DeleteDirectoryInternal(String path) at Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Common.FileSpec.DeleteDirectoryInternal(String path) at Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Common.FileSpec.DeleteDirectoryInternal(String path) at Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Common.FileSpec.DeleteDirectoryInternal(String path) at Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Common.FileSpec.DeleteDirectory(String path, Boolean recursive, Boolean handleLongPaths) at Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Build.Workflow.Activities.DeleteDirectory.Execute(CodeActivityContext context) at System.Activities.CodeActivity.InternalExecute(ActivityInstance instance, ActivityExecutor executor, BookmarkManager bookmarkManager) at System.Activities.ActivityInstance.Execute(ActivityExecutor executor, BookmarkManager bookmarkManager) at System.Activities.Runtime.ActivityExecutor.ExecuteActivityWorkItem.ExecuteBody(ActivityExecutor executor, BookmarkManager bookmarkManager, Location resultLocation) </code></pre>  <p>It's as though the previous build is not releasing control of the dll so the next time the build is ran it can't clear the directory to pull the new code down.</p>  <p>Any help would be appreciated. I can't be the only person running NUnit on TFS 2015</p>
