<p>I have a workspace in VS2015 (same problem in 2013) that I'm trying to completely remove and start fresh with a copy from the server. To clarify, I want <em>none</em> of the files or changes that currently exist and I want to start <em>completely fresh</em> with the server copy of all files. I don't know how to correctly do this, however. I've deleted the workspace, the actual files that the workspace pointed to, and I've cleared the cache locations below, but VS still shows that the workspace exists and won't fix itself. In fact, it still shows the mapping even though I've triple-checked that it's deleted.</p>  <p>I'd like to avoid using <code>devenv /reset</code> since I'm pretty customized and I don't want to fix all of it, but I'll do it if it's unavoidable. How can I accomplish this?</p>  <p>Locations cleared/deleted:</p>  <pre><code>%LocalAppData%\Temp\&lt;all VS files/folders&gt; %LocalAppData%\Microsoft\Team Foundation %LocalAppData%\Microsoft\VisualStudio\&lt;version&gt;\ComponentModelCache </code></pre>
