<p>We used to set up our dev machines to receive build notifications in the task bar.</p>  <p>However, the process we've followed - as per <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms181725.aspx" rel="nofollow">this description</a> - doesn't apply any more with Visual Studio 2015 as the <strong>Build Notification</strong> app is no longer part of the package?</p>  <p>Any ideas what happened to it? Replacements? Work-arounds?</p>
