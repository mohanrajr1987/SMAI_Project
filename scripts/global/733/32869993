<p>Curious issue with a VS 2013 database project. If I do a schema compare with my database on the left and the current TFS files on the right, it tells me I'm missing this Stored Procedure:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/GHbcm.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/GHbcm.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Solution Explorer, however, insists it's already there:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZCzsj.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZCzsj.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Which it is. The SQL file is on the disk and the contents are identical to the current contents of the stored procedure.</p>  <p>If I check the box, update and do another compare nothing happens. The sql file doesn't get checked out and schema compare still insists I need to add it.</p>  <p>It's not a big deal, but it is enormously irritating. Any ideas how it might be fixed?</p>
