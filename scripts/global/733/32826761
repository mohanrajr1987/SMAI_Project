<p>I'm experimenting with the relatively new REST API for the TFS. I can get single work items by ID, all their details (e.g. other linked work items by link) ... but I couldn't find any hint or example how to get all test results (test runs?) for a given test case.</p>  <p>Or do I have to "download" (get) all test results of all tests in all test suites of my plan to filter out manually the two or three tests results of my wanted test case?</p>
