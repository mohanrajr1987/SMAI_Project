<p>I am creating a small application that utilizes the TeamProjectPicker. In my work setting, I currently have two TFS instances as items are being migrated to 2015. I am trying to write against the 2015 instance and its items, but when I run the application the TeamProjectPicker is defaulting to our older 2010 instance. The two instances:</p>  <p>xxx.xxx.60.85/tfs (2010 instance - my application is defaulting to this) xxx.xxx.40.175/tfs (2015 instance)</p>  <p>Is there a way I can get the Picker to change to the correct TFS instance? Below is the code I have for the Picker:</p>  <pre><code>using (tpp = new TeamProjectPicker(TeamProjectPickerMode.SingleProject, true))         {             DialogResult result = tpp.ShowDialog();             if (result == DialogResult.OK)             {                 //Do stuff             }         } </code></pre>
