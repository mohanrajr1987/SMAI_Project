<p>We have a large number of solutions in our source control, which all use NuGet packages from a custom source (<a href="http://nugetserver/nuget" rel="nofollow">http://nugetserver/nuget</a>).

As <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31384189/how-to-get-tfs2015-build-build-vnext-and-nuget-package-restore-to-use-custom-p">suggested here</a> tried just setting the -source to "<a href="https://www.nuget.org/api/v2/" rel="nofollow">https://www.nuget.org/api/v2/</a>". We receive the same error at build whichever source we use:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/SIikA.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/SIikA.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
