<p>I've made a change to a line in a file and the file has been automatically checked out.  I do a "Compare" (VS2012) and that line is highlighted showing the difference between my local version and the server version.  That all is as I expect.  What I'm trying to understand is, if I do a "Get All Conflicts" there are none.  I expected to see the line where my local version differs from the server version, but I don't.  I expected the difference to be a conflict, but apparently it's not?  So how are differences and conflicts related?   </p>
