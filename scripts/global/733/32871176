<p>I'm using Visual Studio Online to manage my project, it's setup as a Scrum project.</p>  <p>My question is, why can't I drag a work item or bug into the To Do, In Progress, or Done columns when viewing the board within a sprint?</p>  <p>I can drag tasks between the columns in a sprint board, but not work items or bugs.</p>  <p>If I go the main backlogs view and go to the board I can drag work items and bugs between columns, but in the board for a sprint this doesn't work.</p>
