<p>The TFS <strong>Rev</strong> field (<strong>System.Rev</strong>) shows up fine in my VS Work Item Query "Choose Columns" dialog and in the results grid. I export this query to Excel (creating an Excel TFS-linked table) and I see all other fields EXCEPT <strong>Rev</strong>.</p>  <p>I tried explicitly adding Rev to the Requirements WIT definition form so it would be present. That fixed access to a custom field, but no change to Rev field.</p>  <p>Configurations tried: </p>  <ul> <li>PASS: TFS2010 + VS2010, VS2012 - VS works just as expected (Rev works like other fields).</li> <li>PASS: TWA (TFS Web Access 2010) shows Rev field just fine.</li> <li><strong>FAIL:</strong> Excel2013, Excel2010 (each on different computer) - Both don't show Rev field in "Choose Column" dialog nor in the table generated. Other fields are fine.</li> <li><strong>FAIL:</strong> SmartWord4TFS + Word2013 - Rev field missing. Other fields are fine.</li> </ul>  <p>I've searched for a long time with absolutely zero hits for Rev or "System.Rev" being a special case in Excel or other Office plug-ins. Please enlighten me! :-).</p>
