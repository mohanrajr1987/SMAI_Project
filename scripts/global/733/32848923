<p>I have been tasked with creating a custom planning view from TFS.</p>  <p>I have a reasonable amount of experience with the TFS Api but I want to try and avoid having to create and maintain a new application for this.</p>  <p>I have looked at SSRS for TFS but I am unable to access all of the data I need (tags etc.) so this is not an option (as it will invalidate support).</p>  <p>I would ideally like to create a "widget" to appear on one of the TFS dashboards but am not sure where to start. The widget would also need to allow access to the TFS api to gather the data it needs to generate.</p>  <p>Please can someone advise where I may look to start or an alternative approach.</p>
