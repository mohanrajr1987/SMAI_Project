<p>I am using new tfs aggregator from <a href="https://github.com/tfsaggregator/tfsaggregator/" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/tfsaggregator/tfsaggregator/</a></p>  <p>Numeric fields are working great.  But now i have a request to copy text field from from parent to child.</p>  <p>i wrote that rule</p>  <pre><code>&lt;rule name="FieldCopy"       appliesTo="*"&gt; &lt;![CDATA[     if (self.HasChildren())     {       foreach (var child in self.Children)         {             child["Title"] = self["Title"];         }     }     ]]&gt;  &lt;/rule&gt; </code></pre>  <p>But it dous not work. Where can i find any examples with child aggregations? Or what have i done wrong?</p>  <p>UPD: It works good with text fields like Title. But Fields with type FieldControl dont copying.</p>
