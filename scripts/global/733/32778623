<p>I've searched for answers to my question on this forum and elsewhere, but so far unsuccessfully.</p>  <p>We are upgrading our toolset from VS2008/TFS2008 to VS2013/TFS2013. We now have TFS upgraded (phew!) but the big questions remaining are:</p>  <ol> <li><p>We have a single build agent using Team Build 2008 running on a Windows 7 x64 SP1 machine, with build results published to an old XP machine. Will the new TFS2013 server be able to work with it fully, or are we compelled to upgrade the build agent to Team Build as well? if so, does Team Build 2013 run on Windows 7 x64 SP1 or will we need a complete new server platform?</p></li> <li><p>If we are compelled to upgrade the build agent to Team Build 2013, will/should our existing build scripts continue to work? </p></li> </ol>  <p>Can anyone advise?</p>
