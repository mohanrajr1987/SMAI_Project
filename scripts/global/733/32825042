<p>Really need a assistance here. Google didn't help me much. I found this is somewhat plain solution.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/183317/Update-TFS-WorkItem-from-Microsoft-Access-using-VB" rel="nofollow">http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/183317/Update-TFS-WorkItem-from-Microsoft-Access-using-VB</a></p>  <p>But is it possible to connect the TFS without the help of dot net visual studio. Something like adding the reference and using those in code.</p>
