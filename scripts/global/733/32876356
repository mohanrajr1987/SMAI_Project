<p>My Work Item table has some custom fields and i am trying to get these fields by querying with WorkItemCollection, like this:</p>  <pre><code>            WorkItemCollection queryResults = workItemStore.Query("Select [State], [Work Item Type], [Title], [Resource Development], [Microvix.Complexity.Development] FROM WorkItems " +                                                 "WHERE [Work Item Type] = '" + tipoWorkItem + "' AND [State] &lt;&gt; 'Closed' AND [Team Project] = '" + teamProjectName + "'"); </code></pre>  <p>Next, i am looping the result, but i can't get the custom fields, like this:</p>  <pre><code>        foreach (WorkItem workItem in queryResults)         {              variable = workItem.Fields["Microvix.Resource.Development"].Value;         } </code></pre>  <p>I Get an error that says the field does not exists.... I have tried with brackets, the "common" name, but nothing.</p>  <p>If a query an other common field like Title, State, it works fine.</p>  <p>I am sure that this field exists in Work Item table, because if a expand the queryResults -> DisplayFields -> Non-public members -> Items, my custom field is there.</p>  <p>I have also checked with TFS plugin from Visual Studio and everything seems to be ok.</p>  <p>Is there any other option to get custom fields from queries, or is there any other configuration to do with custom fields so they can be recognized correctly?</p>
