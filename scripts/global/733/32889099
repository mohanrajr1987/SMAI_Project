<p>I configured by mistake a local path in my workspace for a project in tfs at the project level. But I wanted this mapping only for subfolders not for the project level.</p>  <p>So I edited my workspace and removed the mapping and now it is not mapped.<br> I cleared the cache in appdata folder, rebooted but although there is no mapping in my workspace, the project in source control still has the old local path as a property. (right-click, advanced, properties, "local name" or also the local path in the title bar of source control explorer).</p>  <p>Right-click, advanced, and then "remove mapping" is not available, because the mapping has been removed already. I can map to a local folder, but I don't want to do that, I want it to display "not mapped".</p>
