<p>We just migrated to TFS 2015 from 2013, and now getting lots of TFS Build errors when building fakes. There are many errors that look like this (Admin web app has a test project called Admin.tests): <code>The type 'System.Data.Entity.DbContext' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced. You must add a reference to assembly 'EntityFramework, Version=6.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089'. [C:\Builds\$(BuildAgentId)\$(BuildDefinitionPath)\f3651c6c\TeamProject\WebApps\Admin\Admin.Tests\obj\Release\Fakes\ctp\f.csproj]</code>. Those solutions build locally just fine or under TFS2013 Build system. Is there anything in fakes configuration that need to be changed?</p>
