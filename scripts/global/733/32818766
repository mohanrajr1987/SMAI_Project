<p>Is it possible to get Team Foundation Server 2015 new build definitions using regular object model, or am I forced to get them using the REST API?</p>  <p>If it's possible to using the object model, what class should I use to do so?</p>  <p>I was able to get XAML build definitions using <code>IBuildServer.QueryBuildDefinitions</code>. Is there an equivalent to this method so I can access new build definitions and their variables?</p>
