<p>We have several .NET solutions (desktop apps and an MVC website) we've been working on. The projects were all built in VS2013 and are hosted on a TFS 2013 server. We would like to update to VS2015...but I'm a little wary about it. If we update to VS2015, do we also need to update to TFS 2015? Or is it smarter to run VS2015 alongside VS2013? If we do the latter option, would be still need to update TFS to 2015?</p>
