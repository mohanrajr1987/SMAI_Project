<p>I want to import a very big SQL file into MySql (30GB).</p>  <p>I have tried bigdump.php(some error with foreign keys) script and simple import. After that I tried to do this by command line:</p>  <p><code>(mysql -u username -p database_name &lt; file.sql)</code></p>  <p>After 2 hours I had a 9 GB db. Then after a further 10 hours, I had a 10.1 GB database.</p>  <p>It seems that process is running now but very slowly(200000 rows / 100MB per hour).</p>  <p>How to fix this issue ? Thank you</p>
