<p>I need to write some Unit-Tests for google guava 15 (for an online course). There is a semi-automatic tool involved that reads the source code and executes it with the help of eclipse. So I need readable source code (not only the binary classes) that can be run from within an unittest.</p>  <p>So here is what I did:</p>  <ul> <li>cloned github repo via egit</li> <li>Import from git -> local repository -> general project (I tryed new java project and the new project wizard but that created empty folders, only with general project the source was at least visible within eclipse)</li> <li>went back in git history to guava version 15</li> </ul>  <p>But it seems that he doesn't build the java project now (of course because its a general project). I found some answers to this topic: editing the .project from eclipse to change the general to a java project but that did not work, maybe I did it wrong).</p>  <p>But is there an easy way to do this? Maybe by using a build tool or something? Seems to be very complicated to edit the .project for a complex project like guava, only telling him that this is a java project does not work!?</p>
