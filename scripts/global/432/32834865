<p>I'm trying to write a large class called <code>Networking</code> in a separate python file called <code>networking.py</code> to provide some helper methods. I can import that class in my <code>main.py</code>, however, I would like my networking class to be able to call a method in my <code>main.py</code> (<code>Main</code> class). It won't seem to let me use:</p>  <pre><code>from main import Main </code></pre>  <p>I'm guessing it will cause some type of import-ception paradox. So how can I go about doing this. I only need to call a single method in <code>Main</code> once from <code>Networking</code>, but <code>Main</code> will call multiple methods in <code>Networking</code>.</p>  <p><strong>main.py</strong></p>  <pre><code>from networking import Networking  class Main:      Networking.get("Test")      def receive(st):         print("Received : "+st)         Networking.push(st + "123") </code></pre>  <p><strong>networking.py</strong></p>  <pre><code>class Networking:      @staticmethod     def get(st):         print("Requesting parameter (" + st + ") from smartphone")         receive(st) #method in Main      @staticmethod     def push(st):         print("Sending  (" + st + ")  to smartphone") </code></pre>
