<p>Let's pretend that I have this file called <code>file1.py</code>:</p>  <pre><code>from app1 import ClassX  class Class1:     pass  class Class2:     pass </code></pre>  <p>If in another file called <code>file2.py</code> I want to import <code>Class1</code> and <code>Class2</code> without explicit import this classes I usually need to use</p>  <pre><code>from file1 import * </code></pre>  <p>My problem is, when I do it I'm importing the <code>ClassX</code> too, but I don't want to import the <code>ClassX</code> and I don't to import Class1 and Class2 explicit.</p>  <p>There is some way to import only the classes that I really developed in <code>File1</code>?</p>
