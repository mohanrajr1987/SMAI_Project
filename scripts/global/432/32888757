<p>I have hundreds of medium sized Excel files (between 5000 and 50.0000 rows with about 100 columns) to load into R. They have a well-defined naming pattern, like <code>x_1.xlsx</code>, <code>x_2.xlsx</code>, etc.</p>  <p>I know there are many ways to load these files into R like for-loop's or lapply-type solutions. Hence, my questions are:</p>  <p>What do you consider the best (fastest, most straightforward) approach to reading multiple files?</p>  <p>What tricks or functions do you use?</p>
