<p>I'm a new student in computer science learning Java and using Eclipse and we are now working on arrays but when I tried to practice arrays on my own time did I discover that something was wrong when I imported the Arrays class.</p>  <p>Eclipse said <em>The import java.util.Arrays; cannot be resolved</em>.</p>  <p>I've checked the solutions provided already and it did not help. I have configured a new build path (JRE System Library JRE 1.8.0-60) and have set it to both Alternate JRE and Workspace Default and have even downloaded the newest Java Runtime Environment as well a fresh download of Eclipse but nothing is working. </p>  <p>Is there something I am missing?</p>  <p><strong>EDIT 1:</strong> Yes I have used Project>Clean, it didn't work.</p>  <p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong> I am using Eclipse Helios and I've run it in a online IDE and it works fine. But NOT in Eclipse for some reason.</p>  <p>Code (note: I worked on this at school and it was fine. On my own computer is where the problem came up):</p>  <pre><code>import java.util.Arrays;    public class Chap7Practice {   public static void main(String[] args) {      String [] deck = new String[52];      final String [] Suits = {"Spades",  "Diamonds", "Clubs", "Hearts" };     final String [] Ranks = { "Ace","two", "three", "four", "five","six", "seven",              "eight", "nine","ten", "Jack", "Queen", "King"};       int counter = 0;     for(int s= 0; s&lt;Suits.length; s++){         for(int r = 0; r&lt;Ranks.length; r++){             String card = Ranks[r] + " of " + Suits[s];             deck[counter] = card;             ++counter;         }     }      String [] deck2; //not a good way to copy =deck;     deck2 = new String[52];     for(int i = 0; i&lt;deck.length; i++){         deck2[i] = deck[i];     }      System.out.println(Arrays.toString(deck));  }    } </code></pre>
