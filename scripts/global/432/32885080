<p>I have 20+ Android projects exported from Unity3d, and I need to simply import them into Eclipse and run as Android application, one by one, to get the apk.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/PcwLa.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/PcwLa.png" alt="finder projects"></a></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/f0C0t.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/f0C0t.png" alt="eclipse import project"></a></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/SQaNf.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/SQaNf.png" alt="eclipse run as android application"></a></p>  <p>I have to do it every 2 or 3 weeks whenever our game has new version.</p>  <p>Therefore I am looking for a command line or any batch function in Eclipse or Android Studio.</p>  <p>I found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22893765/how-to-compile-and-run-android-application-using-a-batch-file-and-not-ide">this question</a> but I am not sure if it's relevant...</p>  <p>P.S.
