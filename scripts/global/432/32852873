<p>I'd like to create a config file like this:</p>  <pre><code>var config = { some stuff }  </code></pre>  <p>and import it to my main javascript file.</p>  <p>I know it is possible to import a function, this is part of the ES6 specification (but not supported yet?) and I can import some modules in node.js without any problems.</p>  <p>But what about importing an object? Is there any way to do it?</p>  <p>I try to make my config not a global variable.</p>  <p>Maybe this is not a good idea and there is a better way?</p>
