<p>I am trying to import/update categories using the module being developed for magento MAGMI, i have made my custom category csv file with columns:</p>  <ol> <li>Categories</li> <li>ttf1</li> <li>ttf2</li> </ol>  <p>2 and 3 are custom attributes, What i want to do is to update the categories different customly added attributes using csv file. And i get an error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>String could not be parsed as XML</p> </blockquote>  <p>I thought my csv is not working perfectly, so i exported products csv from magento backend and try to import it, and it gives the same error. I need to import categories via MAGMI, i don't need to include any product data in csv. Will this work?</p>
