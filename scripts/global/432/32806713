<p>Is it possible export the data of advance custom fields saved in the pages of another wordpress installation?</p>  <p>basically, I would like to import this data into my new wp installation, since they have the same contents.</p>  <p>I found the option to export from acf, but it seems to export only the structure of custom fields but not the content.</p>  <p>is it possible? any suggestion? thanks</p>
