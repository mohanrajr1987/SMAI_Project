<p>I have 2 python files. In file1, a list named MyList is created and in file2, the goal is to only print MyList from file1. In file2 I have the code below but it executes all of file1 along with the print function from file2.</p>  <pre><code>#CODE FOR FILE 2 #/usr/bin/python from file1 import MyList print MyList </code></pre>  <p>How do I prevent it from executing the commands in file1?</p>  <p>The code for file 1 is as follows:</p>  <pre><code>MyList={} UserListName = str(raw_input("Provide a name for your list: ")) MyList[UserListName]=[] print "The userlist name is ", MyList  #feed values into MyList[UserListName] using raw_input q = int(raw_input("Specify quantities for your list: ")) ArbitValue = 0 while ArbitValue &lt; q: MyList[UserListName].append(raw_input("Enter value: ")) ArbitValue += 1  print "The values entered in ", MyList </code></pre>
