<p>In an extension to this question: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16076309/import-multiple-csv-files-to-sql-server-from-a-folder">Import Multiple CSV Files to SQL Server from a Folder</a></p>  <p>As the question states, I want to import multiple tables from CSV into SQL server from a folder. But the thing is in my case, is that I can have up to 17 different tables, that all have different layouts. Some have 2 columns, while others have 10 for instance. </p>  <p>Is it possible to create a script that takes into account the different tables setup based on the name of the CSV file, and import it correct if the table actually exist in the folder? </p>  <p>The good thing is that the CSV files never change names/layout. But not all 17 tables are used in every project.</p>  <p>I want the rough code along with proper comments so that I understand it.</p>  <p>Someone do please help me out on this one.  Thanks a lot in advance :)</p>
