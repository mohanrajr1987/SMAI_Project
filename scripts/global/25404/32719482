<p>Trying to make an Airline Reservation program where the user inputs their name and then selects their seat via a radiobutton.</p>  <p>Once they reserve the seat the program is supposed to reset with the chosen seat no longer available for the next person to select their seat. So here is what I am confused about.</p>  <p>How do I get the previously "reserved" radiobuttons to change color and not selectable when the next person is choosing their seats. Eventually the plane will fill up and no more users can choose.</p>  <p>If there needs to be context or clarification for this I will be glad to add on more info.</p>  <p>Thank you in advance.</p>
