<p>I'd like to track a form on my real-estate website. The difficulty is that I have 3 radio buttons (only one can be chosen) and I don't know how to link the button chosen to the event that will be send after the customer has clicked on "Sent" (envoyé).</p>  <p>See the form on the bot left and corner  here : </p>  <p><a href="http://www.ajp-immobilier.com/annonces/achat/appartement/bordeaux-33/102071295.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ajp-immobilier.com/annonces/achat/appartement/bordeaux-33/102071295.htm</a></p>  <p>So my code, would be :</p>  <pre><code>$('.btn-send-contact ').on('click',function() { ga("send", "event", " Page Detail Annonces " , "click" ,"Contact envoyé",); </code></pre>  <p>... but what should I add to indicate inside GA that this event is linked to the chosen radio button? Otherwise I know that the event is "sent" but I don't know for what button...</p>  <p>I apologize if it's not clear enough, I'am not a developer nor a native english speaker.</p>
