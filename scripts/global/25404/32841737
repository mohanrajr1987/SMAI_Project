<p>I am formatting html radio buttons. I want to get something more or less like this (please ignore small font size and aligment) <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/tlkot.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/tlkot.png" alt="expected outcome"></a> </p>  <p>I did this by setting the width and height css properties of each individual button. Like for example here:</p>  <pre><code>#r_starkeAblehnung.css-checkbox, #r_starkeZustimmung.css-checkbox { border: 0px; height: 50px;  width: 50px; } </code></pre>  <p>This works when I look at my Chrome window with 75% zoom -which is my default for this page- but when I look at 100% zoom the radio buttons go back to all being small, and of equal size. They also lose their cool shading - I guess it has to do with a poorer resolution. The radio button dimensions are still there: my elements take up more space. But the radio buttons don't scale accordingly. I don't quite get what's going on. </p>  <p>I tried defining the radio button size in terms of em, but it didn't help. </p>  <p>For example, defining the three different sizes as 1em, 1.5em and 3em resulted in this:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/nkc04.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/nkc04.png" alt="Non-desided outcome"></a>     </p>  <p>EDIT: <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/x4fx5n7v/" rel="nofollow">jsfiddle</a>, which has the same behaviour when changing the browser zoom </p>
