<p>I have a program where user selects from 4 options (A, B, C, D). After selecting an option, user can either select again from these options or end the selection progress. </p>  <p>I am thinking of displaying the options with radio buttons and prompting the user if s/he wants to select more options with a pop-up window. </p>  <p>But, is there a better way of achieving this task?</p>
