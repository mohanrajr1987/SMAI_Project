<p>I have created a form and in this form there are several radio buttons: three for each line, horizontally aligned. </p>  <p>When the browser window shrink these radio buttons wrap so they are not horizontally aligned any more.</p>  <p>The relevant css is:</p>  <pre><code>.radio {    float: left;   height: 70px;   padding: 10px 5px;   margin: 0 !important; }  .radio:nth-child(1) {   }  .radio:nth-child(2) {  }  .radio:nth-child(3) {   } </code></pre>  <p>I need a css only solution to this problem: so far I only found alternative solution (html/css or js) but none of these is purely css.</p>  <p>Any suggestion is greatly appreciated.</p>  <p>dom</p>
