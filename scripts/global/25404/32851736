<p>I've been watching some vids and reading some stackoverflow pages on radio buttons, but I can't find the magic solution I'm looking for.  </p>  <p>The answers I've seen on SO generally show you how to create a group of radio buttons and then you have to <em>press a button to update a text field.</em>  I'm using italics just to draw attention to that aspect of what I <em>don't</em> want.  </p>  <p>Basically, I'm creating a simple program in which someone puts in two complex numbers into two different fields, and then selects a radio button to add, multiply, subtract or divide.  I want the operator field to auto-update whenever a radio button is pressed. </p>  <p>Can someone give me a tip or two?  I'm using C#.</p>  <p>TYIA.</p>
