<p>I have a radio buttons group. The choise is not mandatory for fill the form. At the beginning all the radio buttons are unchecked. If the user unintentionally clicks on one of them, he can not go back, because at least one have to be checked. </p>  <p>So How can I uncheck a radio button and not force the user to make an unwanted choise?</p>  <p>p.s. the form is built at run-time and I am following the MVVM design pattern. For Mandatory choises the radio buttons solution fit very well and I already use it in this case.</p>
