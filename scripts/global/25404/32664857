<p>I've created a contact form 7 in wordpress with two radio buttons. When a user selects second radio button, a drop down menu with three options should appear. I'm really not sure how to get this done. I'm a newbie to this. Excuse if my question or what I'm trying to do is wrong. I have a table with three drop down menu options ready.</p>
