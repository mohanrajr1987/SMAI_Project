<p>I would like to conditionally disable a button based on a radio and checkbox combination. The radio will have two options, the first is checked by default. If the user selects the second option then I would like to disable a button until at least one checkbox has been checked.</p>  <p>I have searched at length on CodePen and Stack Overflow but cannot find a solution that works with my conditionals. The results I did find were close but I couldn't adapt them to my needs as I am a Javascript novice.</p>  <p>I am using JQuery, if that helps.</p>  <p>If needed: <a href="http://codepen.io/traceofwind/pen/EVNxZj" rel="nofollow">http://codepen.io/traceofwind/pen/EVNxZj</a></p>  <p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false"> <div class="snippet-code"> <pre class="snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override"><code>&lt;form&gt; &lt;div id="input-option1"&gt;First option: (required)    &lt;input type="radio" name="required" id="required" value="1" checked="checked"&gt;Yes    &lt;input type="radio" name="required" id="required" value="2"&gt;No &lt;div&gt;  &lt;div id="input-option2"&gt;Optionals:    &lt;input type="checkbox" name="optionals" id="optionals" value="2a"&gt;Optional 1    &lt;input type="checkbox" name="optionals" id="optionals" value="2b"&gt;Optional 2 &lt;div&gt;  &lt;div id="input-option3"&gt;Extras:    &lt;input type="checkbox" name="extra" id="extra" value="3"&gt;Extra 1 &lt;div&gt;     &lt;button type="button" id="btn"&gt;Add to Cart&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/form&gt;</code></pre> </div> </div> </p>  <p>(Please excuse the code, it is in short hand for example!)</p>  <p>The form element IDs are somewhat fixed. The IDs are generated by OpenCart so I believe the naming convention is set by group, rather than unique. I cannot use IDs such as radio_ID_1 and radio_ID_2, for example; this is an OpenCart framework facet and not a personal choice.</p>  <p>Finally, in pseudo code I am hoping someone can suggest a JQuery / javascript solution along the lines of:</p>  <pre><code>if radio = '2' then    if checkboxes = unchecked then       btn = disabled       else          btn = enabled    end if end if </code></pre>
