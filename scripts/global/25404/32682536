<p>I have these two radio buttons inside an Input Form:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;input type="radio" name="info_only_on" value="yes"&gt; Info-only   &lt;input type="radio" name="info_only_on" value="off"&gt; (Clear Button) </code></pre>  <p>It creates two buttons, so the user can check info-only and then turn off info-only if they made a mistake.  I created the 2nd button because once the radio button is checked, clicking it again, doesn't deselect it.</p>  <p>I've switched to type="checkbox", which does let the user deselect.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;input type="checkbox" name="info_only_on" value="yes"&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Looking at specs for the radio type button, I'm not seeing anything for the user unchecking it.  What am I missing?  </p>  <p>I'm using html, php and avoiding javascript.</p>  <hr>  <p>The php used to check the box value is:</p>  <pre><code> // When info_only_on is set to clear, it's value should be passed here as "no"  if($_POST["info_only_on"] == "yes")                                      { $info_only =  "Added Member info online but not paying online. ";   } else  { $info_only = " ";  }       // BUILD UP MESSAGE to email to our membership chair   $MsgToWrite = "\r\n" . $BasicInfo . $PhoneInfo . $EmailInfo; If ($info_only &lt;&gt; " ")  {   $MsgToWrite = $MsgToWrite . "\r\n" . $info_only; } </code></pre>
