<p>We are using a JTable in a very old huge application to display some information. Till now we were working on Jre 1.7.0_17 or 1.7.0_51. Recently we tried to test our application with an upgraded JRE to 1.7.0_75. We noticed that when the JTable is displayed only one row appears for the first time. However during debug we see data for all rows getting added to table. I tried refresh, revalidate, repaint, fireTableDataChanged etc but still only for the first time only first row appears. If we hide and show the table again all the rows start appearing. Also tested on JREs 1.7.0_80, 1.8.0_31, 1.8.0_45 and 1.8.0_51 and the issue is reproducible. Any hint would be helpful.</p>  <p>(Note : The application was developed on very old java version and has been using old style swing dialogs)</p>  <p>Thank You In Advance!</p>
