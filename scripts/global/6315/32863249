<p>I've a <code>JTable</code> which shows an array of data of the type</p>  <pre><code>String [] data = {"String1", "String2", "String3", "String4"}; </code></pre>  <p>but in the JTable I show only the first 3 items and the fourth is hidden for the user. But I would sorter the table even in base of the <code>String4</code>that is not shown in JTable. I read JTable tutorial and I found out how to use <code>TableRowSorter</code>and set a <code>Comparator</code> but method <code>setComparator</code> wants as its argument the column to order but this is not available for me.</p>  <p>Could anyone help me to solve this task? thank you </p>
