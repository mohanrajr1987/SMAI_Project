<p>I am using a jTable which is populated with mysql db data using rs2xml</p>  <pre><code>table.setModel(DbUtils.resultSetToTableModel(rs)); </code></pre>  <p>I have some columns that are displayed by boolean values, but these must become checkboxes. I understand that i have to write my own AbstractTableModel, but I don't know how...</p>  <p>Can one of you give an example of how you extend the AbstractTableModel and use it in your code?</p>
