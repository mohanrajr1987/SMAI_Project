<p>So I'm trying to get data from my database and putting it into a jTable. It works correctly in that it shows the first set of results, but then it just keeps repeating the same records. Anyone have any idea what's wrong with it? Thanks in advance!</p>  <pre><code>void Flight(){ try{      int x = 0;     while (rs.next()){     jTable1.setValueAt(flightID, x, 0);     jTable1.setValueAt(departdate, x, 1);     jTable1.setValueAt(departtime, x, 2);     jTable1.setValueAt(destination, x, 3);     jTable1.setValueAt(arrivdate, x, 4);     jTable1.setValueAt(arrivtime, x, 5);      x++;     rs.next();     } } catch(SQLException err) {     JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(AdminWindow.this, err.getMessage()); } } </code></pre>
