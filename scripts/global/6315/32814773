<p>I have a jFrame with many elements, including a jTable in a JScrollPane. The table responds ok to the keyboard when it's focused, but I would like it to react the same way to UP, DOWN etc. even when it's NOT focused, i.e. when some other element in the frame has focus.</p>  <p>I manage to catch the keyboard event from whatever element is focused, all I need now is to pass that event to the table. I thought that with evt being the KeyReleased event, doing</p>  <p>TheTable.dispatchEvent(evt)</p>  <p>or perhaps</p>  <p>TheScrollPane.dispatchEvent(evt)</p>  <p>would do the job, but neither works: the table doesn't react in any way. What do I do wrong?</p>  <p>Many thanks for your help!</p>
