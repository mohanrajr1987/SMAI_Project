<p>I want to create a JTable having the last column with advanced options icon. On clicking this last column in the JTable, I want a new JPanel to pop up allowing user to enter input for required 4 string input fields. This JPanel when dismissed, should return to the original JTable. </p>  <p>I am not sure where to save the data for 4 fields from the new JPanel. As their would be 4 string input fields per JTable row, just displayed in the JPanel.</p>  <p>Can my JTabel cell hold an object saving the data?</p>  <p>UseCase: I have a JTable with 10 columns. It is getting very cluttered so I want to move 5 columns to a new panel which will be launched on clicking an advanced options icon in the original JTable last column. </p>  <p>Sample code on how to associate the data from the JPanel with the row in JTable will be highly appreciated. </p>
