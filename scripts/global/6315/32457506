<p>I have a small old application designed for one user. Now software should be changed for multi users. Software is realy simple shows just a one JTable,  but data are imported to this table only ones  when windows is opened. And the issue is that  when one user change some data different user  (that works in the same time) do not see this changes because will appears when window will be opened again. And now is me question is in hibernate something like data change litener, that tell to the application tat database  data has been changed and you have to update the JTable. I was thinking about @PreUpdate, but I do not know that is the good idea.</p>
