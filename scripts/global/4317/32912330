<p>I want to develop a java application for my server, but I need to authenticate to a website API (Twitch). To do so, I need to connect to an account through a webpage, so I want to use Lynx to do so. However, when I try to start Lynx from my java application, the program hangs, and does nothing :</p>  <pre><code>Runtime rt = Runtime.getRuntime();          try{              if (os.contains("win")) {                  // this doesn't support showing urls in the form of "page.html#nameLink"                 rt.exec( "rundll32 url.dll,FileProtocolHandler " + url);              } else if (os.contains("mac")) {                  rt.exec( "open " + url);              } else if (os.contains("nix") || os.contains("nux")) {                  // Build a command string which looks like "browser1 "url" || browser2 "url" ||..."                 StringBuffer cmd = new StringBuffer();                     cmd.append( "lynx" + " \"" + url + "\" ");                 rt.exec(new String[] { "sh", "-c", cmd.toString() });              } else {                 return;             }         }catch (Exception e){             return;         } </code></pre>  <p>Apparently this is because Runtime.getRuntime().exec() may not work under certain conditions, but I couldn't find anything relevant to make Lynx work.</p>  <p>Server OS : Ubuntu server 14.10</p>
