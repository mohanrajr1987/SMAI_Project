<p>I got a requirement to build a framework which is highly dynamic/ run-time extensible.</p>  <ol> <li><p>When a new field is added to a database table, should be able to add a new field in the UI form with run-time configurations. Also new form field should be able to be persisted with runtime configurations</p></li> <li><p>When a new field is added to a SOAP response, should be able to add a new field in the UI as well with run-time configurations. Also new form field should be able to be added into form which will be added into SOAP request intern, again dynamically.</p></li> </ol>  <p>With regards to UI changes I'm thinking of introducing server-side service - which will have some JSON configured with spring property listener. I will generate HTML out of JSON at my JS frontend. However I'm still struging with regards to mapping all these things (i.e. SOAP response + My JSON into one XML/ JSON). </p>  <p>Appreciate your input / thoughts / ideas and advise. Please note that this is Java platform.</p>
