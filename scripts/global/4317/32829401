<p>Alright, I think it would be a bit tough to explain what I'm trying to do, but debugger is jamming on "End With" and just couldn't go on. I just can't figure out what's wrong. Any help is highly appreciated.</p>  <pre><code>Private Sub AddHyperlinks()     Dim i As Integer         For i = 3 To 5                 If Cells(i, 1).Value = vbNullString Then                     With Worksheets("Sheet2")                         .Hyperlinks.Add Anchor:=.Range(Cells(i, 2)), _                         Address:="C:\Dropbox\DASC\DASC_v1.00\MIBD\MIB00" &amp; Range(Cells(i, 4)).Value &amp; ".xlsm", _                         ScreenTip:="", _                         TextToDisplay:="Info"                     End With                 End If         Next i End Sub </code></pre>
