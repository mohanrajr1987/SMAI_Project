<p>I'm trying to restart a Tomcat server after SSL certificate added to keystore from Java code, which is a restful webservice in Jersey.</p>  <p>Following is the code snippet :</p>  <pre><code>public void restartServer() throws RestHttpException {     try {          String path = "cmd /c start \\localPath\\apache-tomcat-8.0.24-windows-x64\\apache-tomcat-8.0.24\\bin\\restart.bat";         Runtime rn = Runtime.getRuntime();         Process pr = rn.exec(path);     } catch (IOException e) {         logger.error("IO exception caught while restarting the server", e);         throw new RestHttpException("Error",                 Response.Status.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);     }  } </code></pre>  <p>This is opening cmd window and showing:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>"Files\java\jre7\java.exe" unexpected at this time</p> </blockquote>  <p>and nothing is happening.</p>  <p>The script is working fine if I run directly from cmd and also above code is also working fine when I'm running as normal Java application.</p>  <p>The issue is happening only when it is called inside a REST call. </p>
