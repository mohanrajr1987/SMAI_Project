<p>I am having an issue with updating a KmlLayer in MySceneView.Scene.Layers. This is constantly updated at around 30fps. I have multiple threads (max of 4) calling this function, each has a unique ID. The contents of the kml changes, but the URI remains the same (each thread also has its own kml with different Uri). The problem I'm having is that my application is randomly crashing after running for about a minute, and it's not telling my why. It just says MyProgram has stopped working. If I comment out this part of the code, it works fine.</p>  <pre><code>bool lockWasTaken = false; try {     Monitor.Enter(MySceneView.Scene.Layers, ref lockWasTaken);     var kmlLayer = new KmlLayer(sourceUri); //sourceUri is a local file       kmlLayer.ID = id;       kmlLayer.Opacity = _alpha;       kmlLayer.IsVisible = _visibility;       kmlLayer.InitializeAsync();       if (MySceneView.Scene.Layers[id] != null)            MySceneView.Scene.Layers.Remove(id);       MySceneView.Scene.Layers.Add(kmlLayer);   }   finally   {       if(lockWasTaken) Monitor.Exit(MySceneView.Scene.Layers);   }   </code></pre>  <p>Also tried replacing the layer instead of removing it, but it also crashes</p>  <pre><code>bool lockWasTaken = false; try {     Monitor.Enter(MySceneView.Scene.Layers, ref lockWasTaken);     if (MySceneView.Scene.Layers[id] == null)       MySceneView.Scene.Layers.Add(kmlLayer);       else       {           for (int i = MySceneView.Scene.Layers.Count - 1; i &gt;= 0; i--)           {               if (MySceneView.Scene.Layers[i].ID == id)               {                  MySceneView.Scene.Layers[i] = kmlLayer; //I cant replace the layer using the id as an index, since it's read only using a string index           }       }   } finally   {       if(lockWasTaken) Monitor.Exit(MySceneView.Scene.Layers);   }   </code></pre>  <p>Any help would be appreciated</p>
