<p>I'm trying to create radioButtons. The thing is the number of radioButtons I want to create is variable. As a consequence, I should implement their creation in the java code of my android project (not in the xml).  My problem is I'm not sure how I'm supposed to add these radioButtons to the UI.</p>  <pre><code>for(int i=0; i&lt; quizQuestion.getAnswers().size(); i++){         radioButtons[i]  = new RadioButton(this);         rb[i].setText(quizQuestion.getAnswers().get(i));          //How do I add this to the UI? } </code></pre>  <p>Thanks.</p>
