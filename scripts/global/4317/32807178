<p>I moved a custom control to my custom framework lib (Cocoa Touch Framework):</p>  <pre><code>import UIKit   @IBDesignable public class MyButton: UIButton {       public let DefaultBGColor = UIColor(red:40.0/255.0, green:120.0/255.0, blue:210.0/255.0, alpha:0.6)       @IBInspectable var cornerRadius:CGFloat = 6 {           didSet{               self.layer.cornerRadius = cornerRadius               self.setNeedsDisplay()           }       }   }   </code></pre>  <p>I included successifully the Library to my App project</p>  <p>Now in the storyboard I tried to use it, but setting the customClass I notice that :</p>  <ul> <li>within the Identity Inspector tab the module field is not filled and designable label is not present. neither the user runtime attribute.</li> <li>within the Attribute Inspector tab I don't see my custom property.</li> <li>at runtime I have a message: <strong>Unknown class MyButton in Interface Builder file</strong> that bloc the execution of my app</li> </ul>  <p>how can I solve it?</p>  <p>Have I to do something compiling my Framework?</p>
