<p>I am trying to load a separate application into my c# application so that I can use reflection to view object data during runtime.</p>  <p>Typically this would just require an  Assembly.Load()  but the application launches via an unmanaged .exe that later loads several managed .dll files.</p>  <p>Is it possible(and how) to launch the unmanaged exe within my c# application and use reflection to see object data during runtime of the managed dll files that the unmanaged exe loads.</p>  <p>Note: I'm currently using Process.start() to launch the exe and after some digging I found that remoting would allow a shallow copy of the modules(dlls), would this be an alternative method to access the runtime object data(and how)?</p>
