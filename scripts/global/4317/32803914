<p>I am implementing a class called IntegralImage which has a 2D array as an instance variable. The 2D array represents an image with the height being the first index and the width being the second index. Is the following code construct 2D array in O(n) time with n being number of pixels(height * width) ? Also I don't understand what exactly is memory usage and how to determine it. I have to construct the array using O(n) memory.</p>  <pre><code>private final int[][] integralImage; private final int imageHeight; // height of image (first index) private final int imageWidth; // width of image (second index)  public IntegralImage(int[][] image) {     imageHeight = image.length;     imageWidth = image[imageHeight - 1].length;     integralImage = new int[imageHeight][imageWidth];     int row,column;     for(row = 0 ; row &lt; imageHeight ; row++)         for(column = 0 ; column &lt; imageWidth; column++)             integralImage[row][column] = image[row][column];  } </code></pre>
