<p>I am using array for storing a kind of object. I created an array of some fixed size</p>  <pre><code>int arr[]=new int[n]; </code></pre>  <p>Now after processing this array i want to free upto 75% of the memory from this array(now only n/4 elements are useful). So what my question is, since n is very large and i wish not to hold larger memory than useful, <b>How can i reduce size of array at runtime without copying to new array of size n/4(Is it even possible or not?)</b>.</p>
