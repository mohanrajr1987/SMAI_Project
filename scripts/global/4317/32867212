<p>I successfully dumped data using Java runtime.exec. <br>Now I want to handle exceptions like "mysqldump: Got error: 1045: Access denied for user 'errre'@'localhost' (using password: YES) when trying to connect" <br>when I put error username or password or bad where condition</p>  <p>But what i got from process.getErrorStream() is "Warning: Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure." And getInputStream() is null <br><br> In terminal, the output like this:<br>  mysqldump -uerror -p123456 erp_sys Warning: Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure. mysqldump: Got error: 1045: Access denied for user 'error'@'localhost' (using password: YES) when trying to connect</p>  <p>I did some research, but still can't find a way to get the mysqldump error.Anyone has experiences about this?</p>
