<p>This is the code I've written for counting the number of spaces, tabs and newlines in a string entered by the user(new line is marked by a full stop (".") and I'm doing this without file handling.  This code is throwing a string out of bounds exception during runtime and I'm not able to figure out why. Please help.</p>  <pre><code>import java.io.*; class Specialchars {     public static void main(String arg[]) throws IOException     {          BufferedReader obj=new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));         System.out.println("Enter one or more lines");         String s=obj.readLine();          int count1=0,count2=0,count3=0;          for(int i=0; i&lt;=s.length(); i++)         {             char ch=s.charAt(i);             if(ch==' ')             {                 count1++;             }             else                 if(ch=='\t')             {                 count2++;             }              else                 if(ch=='.')             {                 count3++;             }         }         System.out.println("The number of blank spaces is = "+count1);         System.out.println("The number of tabs is = "+count2);         System.out.println("The number of new lines is = "+count3);     } } </code></pre>
