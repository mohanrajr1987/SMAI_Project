<p>I mostly understand big-O notation, as far as analyzing loops and whatnot to determine the efficiency of an algorithm like the various sorts, but my book's exercise says to "give the worst-case asymptotic running time in Big-O, and the worst case order of growth in tilde notation, as a function of N" for a given code fragment such as </p>  <pre><code>int a = 1; while(a&lt;=N) {a*=2}; </code></pre>  <p>My guess is that the runtime would be O(log n) because a is being incremented exponentially and thus would be faster than linear O(n), but I'm not sure how this relates to order of growth or tilde notation </p>
