<p>I use sublime text 3 in linux for text editing and compiling.When I try to test a program, there are times when the program ends up into an infinite loop. People say that by cancelling build from tools menu you can break through the program execution. But on machine even the mouse pointer freezes up. I cant even point to the tools menu. Is there a better way of handling infinite loops. (Independent of the language in which I compile)?</p>
