<p>Hi I'm getting an error that resource can't be found. There is no gradle error, it was able to compile. But during runtime - resource can't be found.</p>  <p>What I did was:</p>  <ol> <li>ClassA - that has the getter and setter for int variable sound</li> <li>ClassB - passing the data - int - R.raw.sound</li> <li><p>ClassActivity - retrieving the data and passing it to the MediaPlayer object as the soundObject variable</p>  <pre><code>//Class Activity int soundObject; ClassB classB = new ClassB();  //to access the ClassA, I have a method in ClassB that enables me to access it - name getClassA(int soundNumber);  ClassA classA = classB.getClassB(0);  soundObject = classA.getSoundResource(); MediaPlayer sound = MediaPlayer.create(this, soundObject);  sound.start() </code></pre></li> </ol>  <p>What is wrong with what I did? Should I refer it to Resource instead of it. I initially tried doing Resource, but Android Studio suggested me to use int instead.</p>
