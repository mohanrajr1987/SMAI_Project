<p>I have 2D array filled with integers. I want a way to find the average of some portion of the array in O(1) time. For instance, I have the array <code>A[][] = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}};</code> and the input of the algorithm would be boundaries. So <code>Algorithm(int top, int bottom, int left, int right)</code>. If top = 1 , bottom = 2, left = 1, right = 2 , then the portion would be from the second to the third row and from the second to the third column. So the average would be (5+6+8+9)/4.</p>
