<p>I've noticed that scrolling for example a sap.m.List on BlackBerry Z10 is very laggy. The same code is running fine on devices with similar hardware like Galaxy S4 Mini. I'm using a default sap.m.List with 30 StandardListItems. I've tested it inside a cordova container and inside the default browser. Both variants are very laggy. Is it a general BlackBerry problem? Could anyone double check it?</p>  <p>I found out that this is related to the "<strong>touchmove</strong>" event which is getting fired much more than on the other devices/platforms.</p>  <p>BlackBerry Z10 Console output (touchmove event getting fired 500 times!!)</p>  <p><a href="http://postimg.org/image/o6ekvzudn" rel="nofollow">BlackBerry console output</a></p>  <p>Android console output (touchmove event getting fired 2 times)</p>  <p><a href="http://postimg.org/image/4ailggdcb/" rel="nofollow">Android console output</a></p>  <p>Thanks and best regards</p>
