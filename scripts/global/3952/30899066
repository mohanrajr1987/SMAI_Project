<p>I'm new to cornova and i'm trying to add some plug-in to my project. Everything run correctly, but When i'm adding a plug-in, let's say "cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.device". I am not able to use it or I do not know how to use it.</p>  <p>It support "BlackBerry 10". What I am missing? Do I need to include it somewhere? Is there anything I need to do before using it?</p>
