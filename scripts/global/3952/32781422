<p>I am new in phonegap development and need to develop phone gap for Blackberry. Similar question asked <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23960140/build-an-html5-web-app-to-work-in-blackberry-using-the-phonegap-build">here</a> (I don't understand the meaning in this link - "If you wish to build for other platforms, you will need to use Cordova locally on your machine.") .</p>  <p>But not solve my problem. I created a small app with Phonegap latest version via desktop version in visual studio 2012 express installed (OS: windows 8.1 ) and deploy on build.phonegap.com, but not get the blackberry option. </p>  <p>I <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12583507/phonegap-with-blackberry-os-10">read</a> this article and other article too, but not any clue. </p>  <p>My question is currently is there any support in phone gap version to build and deploy for Blackberry phone (with visual studio) and which version of Blackberry phone support this.</p>  <p>If you have answer, then guide me step by step.</p>
