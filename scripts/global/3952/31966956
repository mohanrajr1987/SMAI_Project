<p>I'm using WebWorks 2.2 to develop an HTML5 + javascript application for the Blackberry Z3, Z10 and Z30.  </p>  <p>On starting my app, I would like it to detect if a camera is available. Our IT department may or may not disable the camera on selected phones. </p>  <p>I would also like to detect if the GPS is available. </p>  <p>Can someone please help with how to do this via a cordova/webworks plugin and Javascript?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance, Scott</p>
