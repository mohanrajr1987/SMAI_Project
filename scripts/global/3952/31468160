<p>I am now using WebWorks to make a hosted web app, i.e. an app that open my website url. I also want to include some native Blackberry API functions (e.g. Toast) to the app.</p>  <p>Everything was working fine. I include my URL (for example, <a href="http://www.example.com/index" rel="nofollow">http://www.example.com/index</a>) in the "Main URL" field. And on my site, I have added the line</p>    <p>So it can load the cordova.js and use the blackberry functions.</p>  <p>But if I change my "Main URL" to https like <a href="https://www.example.com/index" rel="nofollow">https://www.example.com/index</a>, the cordova.js can't be loaded anymore. On the web inspector console, it says</p>  <pre><code> [blocked] The page at https://www.example.com ran insecure content from local:///cordova.js. </code></pre>  <p>I have tried to add <code>local:///</code> to the whitelist, and turn the "Enable Web Security" off, but to no avail.  </p>  <p>Please advice what I can do. Thank you very much! </p>
