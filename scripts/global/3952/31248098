<p>We recently released an Android APK to the Amazon app store.</p>  <p>On all our test Blackberry devices, after installing from the app store, the application (name / icon) shows up properly on the device, ie:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/mxIPc.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>However, we're receiving reports that some people are seeing an invalid (hex based) application name after the install, ie:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/2xC33.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>The application works perfectly on these devices - only the app name seems to be "corrupted";  we haven't been able to reproduce this on our test devices, and are at a loss as to whether its an issue with the APK, or an issue within the metadata provided in the Amazon app store.</p>
