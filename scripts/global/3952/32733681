<p>I have a BlackBerry Project from a customer. This project consists of the native Application (XYZAddressBook) and two libraries (XYZAddressBookCommon and XYZAddressBookService). I should reference both the libraries to the application, but how do I make them a library after importing to Momentics IDE?</p>  <p>In Android I just can click "Is Library", but I don't find this possibility in Momentics IDE.</p>  <p>Thanks for your answers.</p>
