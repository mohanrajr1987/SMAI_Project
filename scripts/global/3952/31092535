<p>I have the following markup (and JS code):</p>  <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt; &lt;title&gt;Visibility test&lt;/title&gt; &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt; &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css"&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;p id="vistest"&gt;This line should fade-in after 3 seconds&lt;/p&gt; &lt;script&gt; setTimeout(function () {     document.getElementById('vistest').className = 'active'; }, 3000); &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; </code></pre>  <p>and main.css:</p>  <pre><code>#vistest {     visibility: hidden;     opacity: 0;     transition: opacity 1s ease-in-out; }  #vistest.active {     visibility: visible;     opacity: 1; } </code></pre>  <p>You can <a href="http://stackexchange.marcelkorpel.nl/vistest/" rel="nofollow">view the example online</a> (alas, JSFiddle doesn't work in the BB OS 10 browser, so you can't play with it).</p>  <p>In any browser I tried, this faded in the line of text after 3 seconds. However, on my BlackBerry phone (a Q10 with OS 10.3.1.1779) the text doesn't appear. On a test site, where this method should pop up a menu, other element styles like <code>:hover</code> and <code>background-color</code> were also not applied after changing the <code>class</code> of the to-be-faded-in element to <code>active</code>.</p>  <p>I tried to use the built-in web inspector of my phone, where it seems that disabling the <code>transition</code> style makes the element appear, but it doesn't disappear again when the transition rule is enabled again. Also, I managed to show the said menu when enabling desktop mode in the developer tools, but I can't reproduce this now. Also, forcing the users to manually enable desktop mode on their phones is of course a no-go.</p>  <p>Is this a browser bug? Can it be circumvented one way or another?</p>
