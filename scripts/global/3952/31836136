<p>I'm developing an application based on jQuery. The issue is that I have an input field where I tap on it, the keyboard of my phone popup. However, the field is still behind the keyboard and I need to scroll my screen to see the field.</p>  <p>In my HTML page I did the following:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;script&gt;       $('#div1').click(function() {             $('#p2EmpContPer').focus();         }); &lt;/script&gt;  &lt;div id= "div1" class="float-right mobile-input-container"&gt;     &lt;input id="p2EmpContPer" type="text" class="font14 format-decimal inline-block" value="" /&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>What I want is when I click on the input field, I need the keyboard to popup (which is already working) and the app will focus on the field (which I'm unable to accomplish).</p>  <p>Issue is appearing on <strong>Blackberry</strong> devices only.</p>  <p>The app is built using Cordova.</p>
