<p>I try to build my app to blackberry (Blackberry Z10) which works on iOS and Android well. The camera has a strange behaviour (navigator.camera.getPicture), when i open the camera, the error callback called immediately in the background and the error message is empty. I can't see anything int the error log.</p>  <p>When i create a photo nothing happens, the device returns to the app and nothing called. I tried the following permissions but without error messages i can't find out what is the problem.</p>  <p><strong>use_camera, use_gallery, run_when_backgrounded</strong></p>  <p>On the other platforms everything works fine. Have you seen this problem?</p>
