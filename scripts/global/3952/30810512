<p>On Android, when a user purchases a "consumable" item (in quotes since that distinction doesn't really exist any more since API v3), my app needs to actively <a href="https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/api.html#consume" rel="nofollow"><strong><em>consume</em></strong></a> the item before the user can buy another copy. When I query the currently owned items, only items that have not been consumed are included in the list. So, if I only consume items after making 100% sure that I have successfully credited the user with the benefits, there is no way that the user can get charged twice.</p>  <p>This is similar to transactions in iOS that have not been <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/StoreKit/Reference/SKPaymentQueue_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/SKPaymentQueue/finishTransaction:" rel="nofollow"><strong><em>finished</em></strong></a> yet.</p>  <p>The Blackberry Store also offers the distinction consumable vs. non-consumable when creating a new item, but the <a href="http://www.blackberry.com/developers/docs/payment/1.8api/" rel="nofollow">API</a> doesn't seem to offer any methods at all that mention consumability of items or app-triggered completion of a transaction.</p>  <p>So, can a user just always purchase more copies of consumable items without my app having to actively consume the previous purchase first? Even if there is a transaction that my app hasn't completed processing yet?</p>  <p>If so, how do I go about ensuring correct delivery of the item? For example, if the user's phone crashes after the purchase is made but before my app has the time to process the success notification, how do I find out about the pending transaction? Are all previous purchases kept in the PurchaseHistory (not just the current uncompleted ones like on Android)? Can I rely on the PurchaseHistory always being 100% accurate and up to date, so that I can reliably prevent my user from buying the same consumable item twice in the case where the success notification was dropped?</p>  <p>Do consumable items show up in all PurchaseHistory's for a user account across all devices? If so, I would need to make sure manually that the (let's say) in-app currency only gets added once to the device where it was purchased, correct?</p>
