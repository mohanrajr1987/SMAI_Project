<p>I am using Blackberry WebWorks to try to make a WebApp that points to my site. My site is https. In the config.xml, I have  <code>&lt;content src="https://example.com"/&gt;</code></p>  <p>I also want to use some native functions of BB10, like sharing and toasting, so I also have the line  <code>&lt;script src="local:///cordova.js" type="text/javascript" &gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> on <a href="https://example.com" rel="nofollow">https://example.com</a>.</p>  <p>But once I run the app, the web inspector console says:</p>  <p><code>[blocked] The page at https://example.com ran insecure content from local:///cordova.js.</code></p>  <p>And variable blackberry is undefined so I cannot call the Blackberry functions. </p>  <p>How can I solve it? Your help is very much appreciated. Thank you very much!</p>
