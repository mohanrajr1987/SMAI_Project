<p>I`m trying to send a push notification from a BES(Blackberry Enterprise Server) to an enterprise application. The application is build with BB10-WebWorks.</p>  <p>My goal is fairly simple. I just want to receive a Push Notfiication on the device-</p>  <p>My config.xml contains:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;rim:invoke-target id="de.myserver.invoke.push"&gt;     &lt;type&gt;APPLICATION&lt;/type&gt;     &lt;filter&gt;       &lt;action&gt;bb.action.PUSH&lt;/action&gt;       &lt;mime-type&gt;application/vnd.push&lt;/mime-type&gt;     &lt;/filter&gt;   &lt;/rim:invoke-target&gt;    &lt;!-- Have an invoke entry here for when a notification is clicked on in the BlackBerry Hub --&gt;   &lt;!-- This will cause the application to be opened --&gt;   &lt;rim:invoke-target id="de.myserver.invoke.push"&gt;     &lt;type&gt;APPLICATION&lt;/type&gt;     &lt;filter&gt;       &lt;action&gt;bb.action.OPEN&lt;/action&gt;       &lt;mime-type&gt;text/plain&lt;/mime-type&gt;     &lt;/filter&gt;   &lt;/rim:invoke-target&gt; </code></pre>  <p>The message from the BES contains:</p>  <pre><code>http://server.de:8080/push?DESTINATION=$pushRecipient&amp;PORT=&lt;client_port&gt;&amp;REQUESTURI=/ </code></pre>  <p>The problem is, that i don't receive any push notification. We see that the BES is getting the message and everything looks fine. But the device of the User or the devices of the members of the group are getting nothing.</p>  <p>What exactly needs to be the <strong><em>client_port</em></strong>? I tried the application ID (from the WebWorks project) and the two target-IDs but nothing worked so far. Is there something else?</p>  <p>Additionally i tried all the registrations from the sample App <a href="https://github.com/blackberry/BB10-WebWorks-Samples/blob/master/pushCapture/www/js/register.js" rel="nofollow">Sample App</a> but i dont know what i need from this when using the BES for the Notifications. My understanding is, that i dont need to register anything if i just want to get a push Notification from the BES?</p>  <p>Any help would be nice. Thanks in advance!</p>
