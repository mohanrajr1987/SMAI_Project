<p>I'm trying to use the 'date' type for an input field in a PhoneGap application. It works on iOS and Android devices, but Blackberry treats it like a regular input field.</p>  <p>It's my understanding that Blackberry supports the "date" input type. <a href="https://developer.blackberry.com/html5/documentation/v1_0/html_input_types_1247751_11.html" rel="nofollow">https://developer.blackberry.com/html5/documentation/v1_0/html_input_types_1247751_11.html</a></p>  <p>I've tried dozens of ways of structuring the HTML, including removing all JS/CSS and making the app only one line:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;input type='date' class='submission-field date' name='my_date' /&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I've tried many variations of this line, including:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;input type="date" id="txtDate"  min="2010-01-01" max="2018-12-31" value=""/&gt; </code></pre>  <p>When I create a webpage with this line of code and visit it on the Blackberry device's browser, it correctly opens a native date picker. So it works in the browser, but not in PhoneGap application.</p>  <p>I've also updated Blackberry to the latest software.</p>  <p>Can anyone point out what I'm doing wrong, or if this is just impossible and I'm misunderstanding the capabilities of PhoneGap?</p>
