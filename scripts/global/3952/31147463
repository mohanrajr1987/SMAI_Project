<p>I turned my blackberry Q5 on this morning. surprise, surprise, i have the infamous bb10-0015 error. Now i don't mind resetting to factory however the phone wont let me.</p>  <p>When i force reset the phone, the time that it is off, it connects to my computer (the sound goes off) however as soon as it turns on, and shows the error, it sounds the "USB device removed" tune. Is there anything i can do?</p>  <p>I have tried near to everything except remove the back cover of the phone, since it isnt a removable cover and the battery is glued to the other components on the inside.</p>
