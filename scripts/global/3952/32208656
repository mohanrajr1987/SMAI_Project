<p>So, i'm developing a blackberry 10 application (c++ native) and i need some sort of listener for the power button that will work inside and outside of the application.</p>  <p>If i press the power button 2 times while outside, i need it to do something and while inside the app to do something else. </p>  <p>For inside the app, i'm planning to use <a href="https://developer.blackberry.com/native/reference/cascades/bb__cascades__keylistener.html" rel="nofollow">cascade key listener</a>, but have no idea what to use for outside of the app.</p>
