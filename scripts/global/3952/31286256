<p>I converted an android .apk build to a BB 10 .bar build. </p>  <p>I renamed .bar file into .zip and opened the Meta-Inf/Manifest.MF file.  The permissions here are:</p>  <p><code>Entry-Point-User-Actions: access_internet,access_shared,play_audio,post_notification</code></p>  <p>But I received a screenshot from a user with the permissions required by the BB app and they are:</p>  <pre><code>Phone Shared files Device identifying information Run when minimized </code></pre>  <p><strong>There is no full match between what I see in the Manifest.MF and what I see on device...Where should I look in the .bar file for the permissions?</strong></p>
