<p>We have a customer in the UK running BES 5.0.4 and Exchange (not sure version can find out if needed). We are porting the customer's mobile phone numbers between carriers. </p>  <p>The problem is this: if an email is received for a user while their SIM is in the dark period between providers during porting, the email message is not updated to the device when it fires up on the new network. To clarify: the message is in the user's email inbox, but never gets updated to the device.</p>  <p>Messages received AFTER the device registers on the new network are updated to the device fine.</p>  <p>The customer has been advised by BB that this is normal behavior. However an ex-BB contractor has advised us that that is not so, and emails received during the porting blackout SHOULD be updated to the device.</p>  <p>Does anyone have any experience of this, and are there any settings/logs we should advise them to look at? As you can tell we are rather at arm's length in this, but this issue is affecting our project and we would like to find an answer if possible. Any advice would be very welcome.</p>
