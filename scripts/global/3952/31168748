<p>I have built an Android app, and since now it is easily possible to create a .bar file (blackberry app) I decided to offer it also on blackberry. I got it running and everything works fine. </p>  <p>But there is just this thing that the app still looks and feels like android (I know, it is because it is android). I already made some modifications for the blackberry app, so you get more of the blackberry feeling, but it is still not "perfect" (as far as I can tell). Right now I am sarching for BB10 screens of those controls that I am using, and I am trying to rebuild them in my android app.</p>  <p>In order to fasten this process, I was wondering if there is a style, skin, theme or something similar which I could download and apply to my app so that all controls (dropdowns, fonts, toolbar, text input ...) get the blackberry style. </p>  <p>thanks</p>
