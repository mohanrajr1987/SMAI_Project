<p>I am working on my new project in CakePHP 3 with PostgreSQL database. I have created a few stored procedures. I am trying to call them in cakePHP 3.0 using below code. But not sure, Is this the right way to do this.</p>  <pre><code>$sql = "SELECT check_pass('test123','123456')"; $connection = ConnectionManager::get('default'); $results = $connection-&gt;execute($sql)-&gt;fetchAll('assoc'); </code></pre>  <p>Please suggest if is any other better way to do this.</p>
