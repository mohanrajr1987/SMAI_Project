<p>I have an array_agg column in postgresql which has values like these: </p>  <pre><code>"{Metabolic/Endocrinology}" "{Cardiovascular}" "{Oncology}" "{Autoimmune/Inflammation}" </code></pre>  <p>Basically a string variable being array_agg by an id. </p>  <p>Now I want to fetch all records from this table where either of Oncology or Autoimmune/Inflammation is present. </p>  <p>I am doing something like this but I am not sure why it is throwing an error. </p>  <pre><code>select * from Table where id = ANY('{Oncology,Autoimmune/Inflammation}') </code></pre>  <p>It throws the following error. </p>  <pre><code>ERROR: operator does not exist: text[] = text SQL state: 42883 Hint: No operator matches the given name and argument type(s). You may need to add explicit type casts. Character: 67 </code></pre>  <p>Please note I have also used ::TEXT [] and it still gives an error. </p>
