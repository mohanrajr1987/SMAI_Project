<p>I have a varchar field that has a key that is made up of a string that sometimes has some pattern to it, which starts with a name &amp; timestamp.</p>  <p>I'd like to support deleting old records that have a given prefix, and I want run a query like <code>DELETE FROM table WHERE key &lt; %s</code>, but I want to know exactly what I'm getting myself into.  I can't find any official docs about how this should work.  Do they exist?  I found <em>Practical Postgres</em> book that mentions it's based on alphabetical order, but I'm not sure if that is still true in any official docs.  Is there anything up-to-date I can refer to other than my poking around?</p>
