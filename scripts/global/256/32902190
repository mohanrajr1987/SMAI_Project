<p>I need to convert some MySQL databases to Postgresql.</p>  <p>I came across the <a href="https://github.com/dimitri/pgloader" rel="nofollow">pgloader</a> script, which promises to be the best solution, but coming from a Windows environment I have <em>no idea</em> how to build it. My server has CentOS7, but I have never compiled anything myself on it, other than with <code>yum</code>. I just don't know where to start or even how to run the bootstrap-centos7.sh script, which is mentioned in the readme-file.</p>  <p>Did anyone ever compile pgloader on Windows or can provide some clear steps how to build this program on CentOS7 ?</p>
