<p>I'm having a peculiar problem with one group. I have revoked all database access for this group I have revoked all schema access for this group I have revoked all table access for this group I have revoked all execute privileges on functions When I try to drop the group, I get an error saying it cannot be dropped because the group have a privilege on some object.</p>  <p>How can I find out what privileges a group has on redshift? Thanks</p>
