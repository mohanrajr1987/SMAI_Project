<p>I have the following Postgres query, the query takes 10 to 50 seconds to execute. </p>  <pre><code>SELECT m.match_id FROM match m WHERE m.match_id NOT IN(SELECT ml.match_id FROM message_log ml) AND m.account_id = ? </code></pre>  <p>I have created an index on <code>match_id</code> and <code>account_id</code></p>  <pre><code>CREATE INDEX match_match_id_account_id_idx ON match USING btree   (match_id COLLATE pg_catalog."default",    account_id COLLATE pg_catalog."default"); </code></pre>  <p>But still the query takes a long time. What can I do to speed this up and make it efficient? My server load goes to 25 when I have a few of these queries executing.</p>
