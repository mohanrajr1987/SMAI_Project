<p>I had some stuff on my site that was displaying in a different order depending on what was last edited in the db.</p>  <p>I confirmed that in the shell, the order of what was returned for </p>  <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;foo.objects.all() </code></pre>  <p>was dependent on what was last edited. I know how I can make the objects display in the order I want, but I could not come up with an explanation for why it was pulling them by the last edit. What field in the database is it going by? Is the database simply ordered differently by what was edited?</p>
