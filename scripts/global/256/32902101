<p>I have an existing PostgreSQL database with lots of columns with data types like "numeric(27,10)" or "numeric(17,2)".  In the Sails models I've set up for each table, I list the type of each attribute as either integer or float.  However, when Sails outputs JSON for these tables, the data are represented as strings.</p>  <p>I can always run something like parseInt() on the client side, but is there a better way to fix this by reconfiguring sails?</p>
