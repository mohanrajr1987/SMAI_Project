<p>So, if I have a number of records I want to insert into a foreign table, I could do this (pseudocode):</p>  <pre><code>DO     INSERT INTO my_fdw_table VALUES next_row; LOOP </code></pre>  <p>or this:</p>  <pre><code>INSERT INTO my_fdw_table SELECT all_the_rows; </code></pre>  <p>To my intuitions, the second seems more efficient, because all the data is sent in one go, with less repeated SQL keywords.</p>  <p>However, I don't know whether the second would really result in just as many round trips. I also don't know or whether or the second would risk hitting some kind of statement length limit if there were a lot of rows?</p>  <p>I'm using postgres 9.3</p>
