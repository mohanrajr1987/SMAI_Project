<p>I am trying the PostgreSQL database for the first time, after having worked for some time with MySQL. My environment is a shared hosting with cPanel and phpPgAdmin. One thing that puzzles me is the database collation. My hosting's cPanel always creates databases with the <code>Encoding</code>, <code>Collation</code>, and <code>Character Type</code> set to <code>UTF8</code>, <code>en_US.UTF-8</code>, and <code>en_US.UTF-8</code> respectively. I don't seem to have any way to change it, because the database is created via cPanel, there are no options there, and according to this answer, these parameters can only be changed by re-creating the database with the desired settings.</p>  <p>So I was wondering: does it actually matter? If the collation is set to en_us.UTF8, what will happen with non-English and even non-Latin strings, such as Russian or Hebrew? How will they be sorted? </p>
