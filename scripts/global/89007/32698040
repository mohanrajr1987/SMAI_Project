<p>I am having trouble with the ng-repeat directive inside of my Ionic app. I have a list of items where user can add an item to the list or remove it.</p>  <p>I recently changed the $scope.items to $rootScope.items to make the list available across the whole app without having to declare separate scopes when I needed to access the list. So I assume this will have something to do with this behaviour.</p>  <p>What happens is when I modify the list, the ng-repeat registers the change and displays the DOM for the list item, but the content inside the item where I print the item name is no longer visible until I refresh the browser/re-open the app.</p>  <p>See the screens attached to visualise my problem.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/R6lCQ.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/R6lCQ.png" alt="Before"></a></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/SOxkB.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/SOxkB.png" alt="And after"></a></p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
