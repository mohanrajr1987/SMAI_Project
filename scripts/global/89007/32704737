<p>I have a copy button that has:</p>  <pre><code>$scope.copyHeadline = function (headline) {         var headlineCopy = headline;         var current_time = Date.now();          headlineCopy.label = headline.label + ' (Copy ' + current_time + ')';                     $scope.headlineList.push(headlineCopy);     } </code></pre>  <p>but I get the "Duplicates in a repeater are not allowed" error.  I notice that everyone element in the array or list that i have has some sort of hidden property like:</p>  <pre><code>$$hashKey: "object:135" </code></pre>  <p>which i'm pretty sure is what it's duplicating but I can't change?</p>  <p>I read that I can use:</p>  <pre><code>track by $index </code></pre>  <p>but what ends up happening is that when I push the Copy button, it also edits the original element that I was copying as well so that doesn't work..</p>  <p>I was also of thinking of just creating a whole new element and writing a function that'll literally copy every element into a new one.. but this Class alone has several subclasses with ALOT of properties. So i guess I just wanted to see if there was an easier of doing it before I resort to that method.  Thanks!</p>
