<p>I have an ng-repeat with an ng-show inside. The variable passed to ng-show is not fully initiated until a promise in my controller resolves. </p>  <p>This is causing the ng-show to always end up reading a "falsey" object because it is reading the value before the promise finishes getting the correct results from the service. </p>  <p>Is there a way to cause the ng-show to wait until my objects are fully initialized? </p>
