<p>I am using deckgrid in conjunction with a custom built infinite scroller to load a continuous stream of photos in Angular laid out in a masonry layout. The data set returned each time is quite large and I had noticed that deckgrid calls quick-ng-repeat on the data set to generate the cards. Deckgrid also places a watchCollection on the data set so when the data set changes (triggered by appending data to the data set when user scrolls to the bottom), the ng-repeat will re render everything in the data set (old and new data alike).</p>  <p>Unfortunately, re rendering each card is extremely expensive given the size of the data set and other post processing that my application has to do. I want to be able to leave the already rendered cards as is and only render new cards with the newly fetched data. In other words is there a way for ng-repeat to un bind on elements that have already been rendered?</p>
