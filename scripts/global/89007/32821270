<p>Let's say we have the following list being populated by ng-repeat:</p>  <ul> <li>A</li> <li>B</li> <li>C</li> </ul>  <p>and we use a filter which removed <em>A</em> and <em>C</em>. While being transitioned out (or in, if filter removed), NgAnimate applies the class <em>.ng-leave</em> on items <em>A</em> and <em>C</em> (<em>.ng-enter</em> in other case).</p>  <p>I use these classes in conjunction with CSS to make animations.</p>  <p>The problem?  Item <em>B</em> has no class.  This means that even though its position will change, there will be nothing I can use to bind an animation to it.  So the item will just flicker into its new place.</p>  <p>Evidence: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/AJnvn.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/AJnvn.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Note item in the middle.</p>
