<p>I am using materialize.js for a project and I have an ng-repeat element with contents of my user array:</p>  <pre><code>         `&lt;div id="userObj" ng-repeat="user in allUsers"&gt;` </code></pre>  <p>The standard button <code>&lt;a class="waves-effect waves-light btn modal-trigger" href="#modal1"&gt;Modal&lt;/a&gt;</code> works when placed outside of the ng-repeat, but it needs to be present for every user in order to open an edit window. However, every time I put it inside the repeat directive the #modal1 is not called.</p>  <p>Has anyone else ran into problems with the materialize moda-trigger button?</p>
