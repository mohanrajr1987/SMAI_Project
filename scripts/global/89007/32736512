<p>I am using ng-repeat to render information provided by a rails api. </p>  <p>I have 2 objects in my array, with different prices.</p>  <p>What I want to do is display to the user a price per hour, but dependant upon the price, I need to divide by a different number, meaning that depending upon the index of the item in the array. Currently, I am getting the total price, for each item, but wish to divide both items differently.</p>  <p>Currently the code I have is this:</p>  <p><strong>Javascript/Angular</strong></p>  <pre><code>apiCall(function (data) {     for(var i=0; i&lt;data.length;i++){     controller.holder.push({     id: data[i].id,     price: data[i].price     }); }  controller.holder = [   {     id: 1,     price: 100 },{    id: 1,    price: 500 }] </code></pre>  <p><strong>HTML</strong></p>  <pre><code> &lt;div ng-repeat="pack in Test.holder" class="col-sm-6"&gt;       &lt;p&gt;{{pack.hours}}  - {{pack.price | currency }}&lt;/p&gt;        &lt;button translate&gt;Go&lt;/button&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;   </code></pre>  <p>What I wish to achieve is something like this (please see comment in the code):</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div ng-repeat="pack in Test.holder" class="col-sm-6"&gt; //if pack index in holder is 0 divide the item by 5 //if pack index in holder is 1 divide the item by 10            &lt;p&gt;{{pack.hours}}  - {{pack.price | currency }}&lt;/p&gt;            &lt;button translate&gt;Go&lt;/button&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;   </code></pre>  <p>By using $index is there a way to do this? After a lot of research I could not find a good answer for this. </p>  <p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. Please let me know if any of the above is unclear and I can provide more details.</p>
