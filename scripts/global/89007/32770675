<p>I have a div that I need to repeat by a sub group of newRat.  Can I create that sub group by grouping by substring?</p>  <p>This works, but I want newRat to be broken out more.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div ng-repeat="(group, persons) in filteredPersons | groupBy:'newRat'"&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Like this...</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div ng-repeat="(group, persons) in filteredPersons | groupBy:'newRat.substring(0,1)"&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Each substring's first value is different, but the same for the groups. Example data... Group 1 = 9P, 9O, 9J Group 2 = 7P, 7Y, 7J etc...</p>
