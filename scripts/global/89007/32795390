<p>I'm using angular's ng-repeat to present very large amounts of information. To handle this I've started using a filter.</p>  <p>I'm now trying to wrap it all in an angular directive that will handle paging by using a the ng-repeat and ng-filter, showing only X out of Y results. (results 100, showing 20-30).</p>  <p>I'm trying to present it in a similar way you'd encounter paging on an iPhone (with the number of pages represented as dots and clicking causing an animated scroll to another page).</p>  <p>As to my question, I'm stumped at what would be considered an 'angularish' way to solve my problem. The only real way I see to achieve this animation, is to render several divs, each with a certain width and perform a scroll between them. However, this doesn't really use the ng-filter's capabilities. I've also encountered the ng-animate class, but not sure how to achieve a paging effect with it. </p>  <p>Could anyone please direct me to a correct 'angularish' line of thought / solution? </p>
