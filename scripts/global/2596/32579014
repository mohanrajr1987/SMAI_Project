<p>I'm trying to authenticate to Opends server using winldap , I installed my self signed certificate to system trusted root certificates,personal store etc(where ever applicable). ldp.exe which is a tool by microsoft works fine for ssl and tls connection .I have 2 user accounts in my PC(admin and Administrator) everything works fine for both user accounts , except my windows service.</p>  <p>My windows service(a library management program) couldn't verify the server certificate. but my sample code works(which is a small part of code similar to my windows service) ,</p>  <p>I have seen similar scenarios on this website and their suggestion (<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa702621.aspx" rel="nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa702621.aspx</a>). </p>  <p>My service displays Group name as N/A in services tab and user name as SYSTEM in processes tab of task manager and I'm not sure what to do , please some one help me to solve this issue.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
