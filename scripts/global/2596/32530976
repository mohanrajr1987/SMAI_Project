<p>I am needing to uninstall a Windows Service in an InstallShield script.  Being new to InstallShield, I've looked online and in discussion boards, even asked people I work with, but to no avail.</p>  <p>I see the Start Type where I can disable the service.  There is also a control setting where it specifies Install Start, Install Stop, Uninstall Stop, Uninstall Delete.  I'm not sure if these are what I need, possible a Install Delete.</p>  <p>Would someone be able to help me out in trying to uninstall a Windows Service in an InstallShield script?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
