<p>my question is the following: When I try to install my Windows Service I get the following error:</p>  <p>snippet: <code> ... No public installers with the RunInstallerAttribute.Yes attribute could be found in the &lt;path to exe&gt; assembly. ... </code></p>  <p>I follow this <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/hh297113(v=vs.100).aspx" rel="nofollow">tutorial</a></p>  <p>I have one <code>Program.fs</code> file containing:</p>  <pre><code>[&lt;RunInstaller(true)&gt;] type public FSharpServiceInstaller() =     inherit Installer()     do         &lt; some logic, doesn't really matter &gt; </code></pre>  <p>This should be sufficient, as a matter of fact, I don't even think I need to add the <code>public</code> keyword to the type definition. Installing this executable with <code>InstallUtil.exe</code> gives me the same error as installing it using the following code:</p>  <pre><code>[&lt;EntryPoint&gt;] let main args =      if Environment.UserInteractive then         let parameter = String.Concat(args);         match parameter with         | "-i" -&gt; ManagedInstallerClass.InstallHelper [| Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().Location |]         | "-u" -&gt; ManagedInstallerClass.InstallHelper [| "/u"; Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().Location |]         | _ -&gt; printf "Not allowed!\n"      else          ServiceBase.Run [| new CreditToolsService() :&gt; ServiceBase |];     0 </code></pre>  <p>I have tried running this script in PowerShell, cmd and Visual Studio CLI as both administrator and my normal account but I keep getting the same error. If anyone knows what I'm doing wrong I would really appreciate some help.</p>
