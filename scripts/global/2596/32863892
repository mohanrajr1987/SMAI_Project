<p>I am writing Two ruby script (Active script and positive script) for monitor some network devices. These scripts are run in two different machines.</p>  <p>Master script is responsible for collect information's from the network devices and log them in to a file.</p>  <p>Slave script is responsible for Monitor the availability of the master Script and if it is not available (Master program is not working or Master Machine is down) Start log down the information's of the network devices until  Master program is restored.</p>  <p>I am wondering how to get the status of the Master program (running or not) inside the Slave program.</p>  <p>Do i need to use a windows service or a socket in order to do this.  I have no idea to work with windows service or socket.  </p>
