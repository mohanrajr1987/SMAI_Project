<p>I wrote a windows service that is supposed to copy a file from a UNC path to the local hard drive using FileCopy and File.Exists. This service works fine when is not on a UNC path but for some reason when the file that needs to be found and copied is on a UNC path it does not work. I tried exactly the same code on a regular winforms application and the code works with no issues. I am running this service with administrator privileges so I believe this is not a permission issue neither a string path issue since the same code works with no issues on a winform application.</p>  <p>Thank you in advanced.</p>
