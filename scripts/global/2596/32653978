<p>I created a Windows Service that will be running 24/7 on a server. </p>  <p>The service's job is to instantly process any message that is sent to my msmq queue.</p>  <p>Here is the code in my service so you have an idea of how I am processing each message in the queue:</p>  <pre><code>protected override void OnStart(string[] args) {     string path = @".\Private$\MyQueue";      MessageQueue myQueue;     if (MessageQueue.Exists(path))     {         // get queue         myQueue = new MessageQueue(path);     }     else     {         // create and get queue         myQueue = MessageQueue.Create(path);     }      // set formatter for all messages     myQueue.Formatter = new XmlMessageFormatter(new System.Type[] { typeof(string) });     myQueue.ReceiveCompleted += messageQueue1_ReceiveCompleted;      // start receive operation     myQueue.BeginReceive(); }  private void messageQueue1_ReceiveCompleted(object sender, ReceiveCompletedEventArgs e) {     // connect to the queue     MessageQueue q = (MessageQueue)sender;      // end the asynchronous Receive operation     Message message = q.EndReceive(e.AsyncResult);      // RETRIEVE MESSAGE INFORMATION (which is simply a list of Ids) AND DO DATABASE PROCESSING HERE      // restart the asynchronous receive operation     q.BeginReceive(); } </code></pre>  <p>I would like to know if running a service on my server 24/7 will eat up resources since it is running BeginReceive() from the time it is started.</p>
