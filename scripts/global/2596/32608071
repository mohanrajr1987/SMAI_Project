<p>I am trying to set up a windows service application that is using Fluent NHibernate to connect to a SQLite DB.</p>  <p>This is the code I am using to set up the DB:</p>  <pre><code>    public static void Create(string dbName, Assembly mappingsAssembly)     {         _mappingsAssembly = mappingsAssembly;         using (var sf = Fluently.Configure()             .Database(SQLiteConfiguration.Standard.UsingFile(CreateDbFileName(dbName))             .QuerySubstitutions("true=1;false=0")             .Dialect("NHibernate.Dialect.SQLiteDialect")             .Driver("NHibernate.Driver.SQLite20Driver"))             .Mappings(m=&gt;m.FluentMappings             .AddFromAssembly(_mappingsAssembly))             .BuildSessionFactory())         {             sf.Close();         }     } </code></pre>  <p>This works perfectly well when I'm running it as a console application. Whenever I run this code inside a windows service I get this <code>FluentConfigurationException</code>:          An invalid or incomplete configuration was used while creating a SessionFactory. Check PotentialReasons collection, and InnerException for more detail.</p>  <p>And the PotentialReasons collection is empty, so it gives no help.</p>  <p>I am not sure what am I doing wrong, I've tried running the service as LocalSystem thinking it might be a permission issue but it didn't help. The sqlite3.dll is in the same folder as the service exe file.</p>
