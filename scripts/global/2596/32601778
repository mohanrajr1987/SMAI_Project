<p>I have windows service program that starts an exe process, and have another user interface that can start same exe like service.</p>  <p>problem is when I start exe from UI, exe can access network share files and in task manager can be viewed without checking the check box: <strong>show processes from all users.</strong></p>  <p>but when start process from serivce, I can't see it in task manager list, and have to check the checkbox I mentioned.</p>  <p>in both situation username tab in task manager is the same, but in start from service not listed  without checking the checkbox.</p>  <p>I checked all 4 types in ProejctInstaller class from serivce project:</p>  <pre><code>this.serviceProcessInstaller1.Account = System.ServiceProcess.ServiceAccount.LocalService;  </code></pre>  <p>any idea?</p>
