<p>I install Windows Service with following code:</p>  <pre><code>ServiceBase.Run(new ServiceProcess(serviceName, serviceArgs)); </code></pre>  <p>From <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/tks2stkt(v=vs.110).aspx" rel="nofollow">documentation</a> I see, that this method also call <code>OnStart</code> method on service. But I want to install service as stopped and later start it manually.</p>
