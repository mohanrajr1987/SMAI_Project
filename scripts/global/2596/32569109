<p>I have service (written in c# 4) running as the Local System  user that needs to communicate with a COM Server (written in ATL) that is configured to run as the interactive user. This COM Server then launches a GUI application.</p>  <p>This works on my development machine but fails on our test environment and other developers' machine. On these machines it appears that the COM Server is not being activated at all.</p>  <p>Any help will be much appreciated</p>
