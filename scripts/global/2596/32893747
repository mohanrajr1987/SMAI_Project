<p>am having wiered issue here.</p>  <p>I am trying to register my windows service. Everything seems exectued well, but its just not appearing in my services list. </p>  <p>Registering my service like following ( on console )</p>  <pre><code>C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\InstallUtil.exe MyService.exe </code></pre>  <p>It executes perfetly fine and does not show any errors. Here is the output from console</p>  <pre><code>    Installing assembly 'C:\Program Files\MyService.exe'. Affected parameters are:    logtoconsole =    logfile = C:\Program Files\MyService.InstallLog    assemblypath = C:\Program Files\MyService.exe  The Install phase completed successfully, and the Commit phase is beginning. See the contents of the log file for the C:\Program Files\MyService.exe assembly's progress. The file is located at C:\Program Files\MyService.InstallLog.Committing assembly 'C:\Program Files\MyService.exe'. Affected parameters are:    logtoconsole =    logfile = C:\Program Files\MyService.InstallLog    assemblypath = C:\Program Files\MyService.exe  The Commit phase completed successfully.  The transacted install has completed. </code></pre>  <p>When i look in event viewer, i see following. I have no idea why it is failing.</p>  <pre><code>Install Service ServiceController Parameters :  config MyService start= demand type= own group= MyService.Group2  ServiceController Parameters :  failure MyService reset= 60 actions= restart/1000// </code></pre>  <p><strong>Note :</strong> I tried placing Debugger.Break(), and it executes perfectly fine, no errors or exceptions.</p>
