<p>Actually I try to install a service called poweroff. This service normally will be installed from a software also called poweroff. </p>  <p>You find it here under old projects:</p>  <p><a href="http://users.telenet.be/jbosman/applications.html" rel="nofollow">http://users.telenet.be/jbosman/applications.html</a></p>  <p>Until now on each pc i want to install the service I use an .cmd file with the content</p>  <blockquote>   <p>poweroff.exe shutdown -create_service -msg "This computer will be shut   down!" -warn -warntime 10 -wait 10 -force -allow_remote -remote_port   3210 -remote_pswd password</p> </blockquote>  <p>it creates the service so I can see it inside the services.msc program.</p>  <p>But now on one pc this command do nothing and when I try to create the service inside the poweroff program there comes an message "Access denied". </p>  <p>Because I logged on as administrator I think not that it is an right problem.  Do anyone have an idea why the service will not created?</p>
