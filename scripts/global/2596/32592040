<p>There is a number of issues logged on stackoverflow about a Windows Service that does not appear in the Windows Services Manager. A number of solutions suggest that you use InstallUtil.</p>  <p>When I run my setup project, my service does not appear in Windows Services, but when I run InstallUtil it does appear.</p>  <p>At least that tells me my project is okay, and the problem is with the setup project.</p>  <p>A good post from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1560407/windows-service-not-appearing-in-services-list-after-install">here</a> talks about adding Custom Functions.  I'm using Visual Studio 2013 and the default InstallShield setup project, and I do not see those options in my project.</p>  <p>Anything specifically that I have to change in the setup project so that it works as well to display the project in Service Manager?</p>
