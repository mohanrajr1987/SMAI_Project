<p>I installed Cassandra from DataStax on Windows 8 and it worked fine. I could use the database itself and could use the OpsCenter without issues. Then i restarted the computer, and the OpsCenter started giving my this message: </p>  <pre><code>Error: ClusterManager instance has no attribute 'sub_services' </code></pre>  <p>Cassandra is working fine, but the OpsCenter isn't. I start the service on the service manager and it suddenly stops.</p>  <p>I've tried <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22410760/datastax-cassandra-opscenter-service-not-starting-on-windows-7">this solution</a>, but it didn't work.</p>  <p>Since i'm learning to use Cassandra, i think the OpsCenter is a crucial visual tool for me.</p>
