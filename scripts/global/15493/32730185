<p>Demand: AActivity contained in section View, and contains a ViewPager, ViewPager contains three fragments. The contents of the fragments filling is based on the data ,which is from Activity of request to the server . The problems encountered: the getData () (ps: Activity request the server to get data method) created in fragments and set to the ViewPager adapter. The problem arises.</p>  <p>Question 1: in the press of setting up the adapter, it will invoke the adapter finishUpdate method, which in turn will call commitAllowingStateLoss method, but if in the process of call I pressed the home button or the return key, the Activity will call onStop method,.At this time, there is a possibility:the program will crash,if commitAllowingStateLoss behind the onStop method implementation. Specific reasons are as follows: <a href="http://www.androiddesignpatterns.com/2013/08/fragment-transaction-commit-state-loss.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.androiddesignpatterns.com/2013/08/fragment-transaction-commit-state-loss.html</a></p>  <p>Android official advice is not using FragmentManager commit method or commitAllowStateloss method outside the OnCreate method .The reason can reference the article links below. <a href="http://www.androiddesignpatterns.com/2013/08/fragment-transaction-commit-state-loss.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.androiddesignpatterns.com/2013/08/fragment-transaction-commit-state-loss.html</a></p>  <p>My solution: in the onCreate () method to create fragments, and then the corresponding request data twice in fragments, in AActivity request interface request again in fragments. But the efficiency is lower. (middle thought of a solution :before using FragmentManager commit or commitAllowingStateLoss method , set a flag bit in the  AActivity onPause or  onStop method for judgment. Although this will reduce the chance to collapse, but will not be completely avoided .I do not know why.)</p>  <p>Question 2: from AActivity jump to other Activity ,and then return need to refresh the content of fragments in AActivity ,the reason is that some state needs to be changed (for example a TextView show "ha ha" originally, but jump back need to display "ha, ha, ha," the fragments will need to refresh, fragments of the management process, however, is "if you have any fragments of instance in memory will use this instance, rather than to create, so I use the FragmentStatePagerAdapter, without using FragmentPagerAdapter, but after the jump back quickly when there is an error, error is: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Fragement no longer exists for key f1: index 3 Methods to solve this error: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11756102/java-lang-illegalstateexception-fragement-no-longer-exists-for-key-f1-index-3">java.lang.IllegalStateException: Fragement no longer exists for key f1: index 3</a> But the problem is not solve all. So, I think of a way to, or use FragmentPagerAdapter, then creat fragments required fields, such as the TextView "ha ha" I defined in AActivity static variables, and then used in fragments. But it seems not a good solution.</p>  <p>Is there any better solution?</p>
