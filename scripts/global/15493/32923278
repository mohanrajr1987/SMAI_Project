<p>I currently have this setup which is done using a navigation drawer and a view pager which handles all the fragments and its transitions.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/iVHIH.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/iVHIH.png" alt="Fragments"></a></p>  <p>What i want to achieve is to completely replace the above screen to this screen. So when a user clicks on the image it would go to the next screen as shown below.The next screen does not contain any tabs or a navigation drawer its just meant to show more details about the item clicked.Should i use a fragment or an activity for this purpose?I also want to use shared element transitions on the image.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/VBWiB.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/VBWiB.png" alt="Next"></a></p>
