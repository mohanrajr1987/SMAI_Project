<p>We are using Retrofit and Activeandroid for my project.</p>  <p>Currently we are facing an issue. The pattern which we follow in our project is, We get data from server and save it into local database and after data saved we call routine which fetches data from database and populate UI this all happens in single Activity..</p>  <p>Now we have an activity which makes 3 server request, and due to which the amount of code in activity increased.</p>  <p>We are trying to reduce Activity code by creating fragment for the activity and giving responsibility of fetching data and displaying data to Fragment. Rest call will be made by activity. Now once the data is loaded from all the 3 request we need to inform fragment about data is loaded, what is the best way for this.</p>  <p>And is it even possible to send data to fragment once it is loaded.. or the approach we are following is not correct..</p>  <p>Please guide us on this..</p>  <p><strong>Edit1</strong> I read about EventBus. Can event bus solve this problem or it will effect the efficiency.</p>
