<p>I previously start speech recognition service from <code>MainActivity</code> by <code>startActivityForResult</code> and put <code>onActivityResult</code> also in the main. I also stop the service by finishActivity in the <code>MainActivity</code>. All work O.K.</p>  <p>Now I pass the active of the service to the <code>Fragment</code> and also the <code>onActivityResult</code> in the <code>Fragment</code>. It get there the replay. But when i put the finishActivity in the <code>Fragment</code> it mark it in red and didn't recognize it. </p>  <p>It is look it need activity so I add before <code>getActivity.finishActivity(THE REQUEST CODE)</code> and it run. But it is look that it doesn't close the service any more. Where could be the problem? Bar. </p>
