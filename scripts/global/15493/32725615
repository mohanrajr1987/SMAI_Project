<p>Does anyone know how to make a viewpager respond to drags/swipes even when someone's finger is on a button within the view pager? I've attempted to override OnTouch (which isn't even being hit when I use breakpoints) and I've tried adding the fragment's touchables to the View Pager's touchables. Both to no avail.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ruacl.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ruacl.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
