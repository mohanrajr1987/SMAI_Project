<p>I want to use a custom date and time picker in my code for that  i created a seperate package and put all the date and time picker classes there. The code is running smoothly if i'm running it from main activity but when i want to call from a fragment it's not recognizing <strong>getSupportFragmentManager()</strong> method  the call which i'm making from my fragment is :</p>  <pre><code>SimpleDateTimePicker simpleDateTimePicker = SimpleDateTimePicker.make(             "Set Date &amp; Time Title",             new Date(),             this,             getSupportFragmentManager()     );      simpleDateTimePicker.show(); </code></pre>  <p>Please help, thank you guys.</p>
