<p>I am working on an Android app that has several different product flavors. Each flavor has a unique set of libraries it needs, but I don't have this information until runtime. Right now, all the features of the app are packaged into each product flavor, even if that flavor only uses a handful of them. What I would like to do is, at startup, determine which features can be accessed, and download the appropriate libraries it will need. Is there a way that I can determine at first startup which Fragments can be accessed by the Activity?</p>
