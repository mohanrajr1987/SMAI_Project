<p>I try to make the speech recognize as show in this link <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/developing-android-applications-with-voice-recognition-features" rel="nofollow">https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/developing-android-applications-with-voice-recognition-features</a>.</p>  <p>It uses a run() method to make it thread on the background, which I call it from the fragment like this <code>SpeechRecognitionHelper.run(getActivity());</code> Then in show it use </p>  <pre><code>ownerActivity.startActivityForResult(intent,SystemData.VOICE_RECOGNITION_REQUEST_CODE);  </code></pre>  <p>where the ownerActivity is the getActivity() I pass it on the run(). So I was thinking I can implement the <code>onActivityResult(..)</code> in the Fragment(which call the run() and get the result on the fly. But it is showing me a mistake when trying so.</p>  <ol> <li>Can't I get the result in the Fragment if I specify it even I use it in anther class?</li> <li>If not how can I get the result if I use the run() method? How get the result if I have to use also the <code>startActivityForResult</code>?</li> </ol>
