<p>i am developing an application. i am using viewpager to display 4 fragments as it's child. in each fragment it is using a listview. My problem is that when using listview it displays each child page's size as the maximum pages child. i want viewpager to recalculate it's size to adjust itself according to it's child's size,also the last listview row is not showing completely. Does anyone know any solution for this?</p>
