<p>How do I assign getActivity() by name explicitly? I have a viewpager with two fragments belonging to different activities.Let's say FragmentA and FragmentB. FragmentA extends BaseFragmentA and FragmentB extends BaseFragmentB. BaseFragmentA belongs to BaseActivityA and BaseFragmentB belongs to BaseActivityB.The ViewPagerAdapter containing the fragmentA and fragmentB belongs to MainActivity.So when i do getActivity() in any of these Fragments it gets me the MainActivity.But i actually want ActivityA or ActivityB. Any workaround?</p>
