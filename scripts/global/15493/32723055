<p>In Android, if you have the Application context you can register an <code>Application.ActivityLifecycleCallbacks</code> instance that will be called everytime an Activity goes through one of its lifecycle callbacks.</p>  <p>How can I accomplish the same for fragments? I think there is no such interface for Fragments nor any clear place where I would add that. </p>  <p>Maybe customizing a <code>FragmentHostCallback</code> creating a <code>FragmentController</code> but how can I plug that for the whole application?</p>  <p>The use case is a library that needs to be notified everytime a Fragment calls its lifecycle callbacks and I don't want to create a BaseFragment. I want to be called only from Application's onCreate and that's it (if possible...).</p>
