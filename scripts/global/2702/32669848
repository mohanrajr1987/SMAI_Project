<p>I have a symfony2 project with a page to write the report of a meeting. It means the user can stay on this page and type for 2 hours without loading any new page. So when the user sends the form, his session has expired and he is sent to the login page. And he loses everything he typed.</p>  <p>I've already seen this post "<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5933774/symfony2-session-lifetime">symfony2 session lifetime</a>" so here is my config.yml :</p>  <pre><code>framework:     session:         handler_id:  ~         cookie_lifetime: 86400         gc_maxlifetime: 108000 </code></pre>  <p>So a 24 hours cookie lifetime and a 30 hour garbage collector... Still, I tried staying 1 hour on the page and I am disconnected...</p>  <p>Any idea where to look at ? Thanks !</p>
