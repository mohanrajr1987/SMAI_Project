<p>We have a number of jquery scripts that run in an e-commerce checkout and everything works fine in Google Chrome and Firefox, but in some IE11 browsers an error occurs. We think it might be some kind of timeout error due to network speed because there's at least one user who said the page was slow to refresh but worked, then the same person another day said it caused the error. If it's not a timeout in IE11 then could it be a timeout setting in the firewall, or a router on the network?</p>
