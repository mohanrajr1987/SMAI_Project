<p>So last night I experienced a power outage which caused my server to reboot. Since then, I haven't been able to access any of my web pages. I keep getting the error "Connection Timed Out" and can't work out why. IIS is running and has been restarted. MySQL is running. </p>  <p>I've probably missed something simple but can't for the life of me figure it out, and after browsing the other questions I couldn't find any answers that seemed to work.</p>  <p>Thanks guys</p>
