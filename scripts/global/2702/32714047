<p>I recently started moving to <code>NSURLSession</code> and its related classes. Unfortunately I'm not able to set correct timeout values in the shared session configuration.</p>  <pre><code>NSURLSessionConfiguration *configuration = [[NSURLSession sharedSession] configuration]; [configuration setTimeoutIntervalForRequest:3600]; </code></pre>  <p>I know, 3600 seems to be a ridiculous long timeout. I chose it because my server is still under development as well and sometimes it does not react fast enough for the actual timeout.</p>  <p>As of the documentation the default timeout value is 60 seconds. Now, when setting an extremely short timeout, let's say 1 second, it works.</p>  <p>But with my 1hour example, it seems to fall back to a lower value. In this case it results in timeouts being thrown after 75 seconds.</p>  <p>Now I wonder if there is any known maximum timeout in iOS 8 or 9.</p>
