<p>I am using Protractor to test my code written in AngularJS</p>  <p>Probably there is some $timeout running in my AngularJS code which is making Protractor wait too long until it times out and gives error. But I am not able to figure out where in my code I am doing a continuous timeout/polling. Might be some library I am using but not sure.</p>  <p>Is there a global way to check in Angular how many timeouts are pending overall?</p>  <p>I am getting this error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Uncaught exception: Timed out waiting for Protractor to synchronize   with the page after 10 seconds. Please see   <a href="https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/master/docs/faq.md" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/master/docs/faq.md</a></p> </blockquote>  <p>I have also tried increasing default timeout of page load from 10secs to upto 60secs which is way more than enough for my page to load. But still no success.</p>  <p>This also brings me to another question: What are the advantages of using $timeout over the normal setTimeout in javascript</p>
