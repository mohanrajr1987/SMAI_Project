<p>When using HTTPUrlConnection, I use the following timeout values...</p>  <pre><code>urlConnection.setConnectTimeout(20 * 1000); // 20 seconds urlConnection.setReadTimeout(20 * 1000); // 20 seconds </code></pre>  <p>When reading, I read in chunks of 4 * 1024 bytes.</p>  <p>I just picked these timeout values from thin air.</p>  <p>What values for connection and read timeouts would be reasonable considering many of my users are using Mobile data.</p>  <p>I would like to make the connection timeout LOW if possible, but not too low that it would result in lots of timeouts and failed data downloads.</p>  <p>Any suggestions?</p>
