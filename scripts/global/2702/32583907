<p>I have an API application built with node and expressjs. Using Apache for reverse proxy, with keepalive enabled.</p>  <p>Some requests (specifically POST/PUT), will end up hanging for 2 minutes due to the default 2 minute socket timeout. Doesn't happen always, but often. As soon as the timeout is hit, the Client then gets the response and continues sending other requests.</p>  <p>It seems to be due to Keep-Alive, although I'm not 100% sure.</p>  <p>Adding the header:</p>  <pre><code>res.set('Connection', 'close'); </code></pre>  <p>Makes the problem go away, that's why I think this is related to keep-alive.</p>  <p>Been researching the issue for 2 days with no success.</p>  <p>Is it worth setting the header and accepting the consequences, or is there any other solution/explanation to this behaviour?</p>
