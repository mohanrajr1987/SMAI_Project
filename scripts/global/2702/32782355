<p>I have an MS Access application that is linked to SQL Server Express (2008 r2) database through linked tables. The system is on a server, accessible via RDP.  I recently made some database schema and application changes. Ever since the update, some on-click actions time out (error: odbc timeout). I have re-linked the tables and views, have reindexed the tables re-created the views, and modified the VBA code (for those function that are timing out) to use ADO instead of calling stored procedures. And also increased the timeout in xThe problem persists. Wonder what could be causing the problem? How do I resolve this issue? Below is the connection string.</p>  <pre><code>"Provider=SQLOLEDB.1;Persist Security Info=False;App=CTS;" &amp; _ "User ID=&lt;user_id&gt;;Password=&lt;password&gt;;Integrated Security=SSPI;" &amp; _ "Initial Catalog=&lt;database Name&gt;;" &amp; _ "Data Source=&lt;server_name&gt;"  </code></pre>  <p>I have also noted that after a timeout (and hanging), I cannot query the table that the timed-out (or hanged) form is based - seems like the table was locked.</p>
