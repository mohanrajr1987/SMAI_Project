<p>I'm developing a web app using AngularJS. It will run for both desktop and mobile browsers and my question is:</p>  <p><strong>Will AngularJS/JavaScript have any problem after long timeouts or due to Android memory management? Will they ever "crash" or be shut down?</strong></p>  <p>So if I browse my page, minimize the browser and get back to it after some hours, will the environment still be ok or do I have to reload everything to make it work?</p>  <p>Thank you! :)</p>
