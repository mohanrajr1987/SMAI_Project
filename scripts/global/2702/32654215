<p>I've just installed this awesome docker.  I made a container from ubuntu 14.04. Also I made a program which loops endlessly and prints loop count. This is what I executed.</p>  <pre><code>timeout -k 1s 1s ./a.out </code></pre>  <p>(Of course a.out is which I made)</p>  <p>However on normal ubuntu, it stopped at about 6000~7000 number but on the docker container it never stops(actually stopped at about 4000000 not by timeout command but by <code>^c</code></p>  <p>So I want to use <code>timeout</code> on docker container. </p>  <p>What should I do? :(</p>
