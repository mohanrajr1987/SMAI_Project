<p>Is there any way to time out a method after some time if it does not return result without using asynchronous programming?</p>  <p>If it cant be done without  asynchronous programming ,Please give me the asynchronous solution but the former is preferred.</p>  <pre><code>static void Main(string[] args){ string s=function(string filename); //want to time this out in 10 secs if does not return result  }   public string function(string filename){  //code placed here to ftp a file and return as string  //i know .net ftp library has its own timeouts, but i am not sure if they are that trust worthy  } </code></pre>
