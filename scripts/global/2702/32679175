<p>I'm researching for several hours now and cant solve my problem.</p>  <p>I got some protected content approving with</p>  <pre><code>WebSecurity.RequireAuthenticatedUser(); </code></pre>  <p>whether the user may do stuff or not.</p>  <p>And i got some public content where i want to put some protected stuff into.</p>  <p>Looks like:</p>  <pre><code>[...PUBLIC STUFF...]  @if(WebSecurity.IsAuthenticated) { [...SHOW PROTECTED STUFF...] }    [...MORE PUBLIC STUFF...] </code></pre>  <p>Now the problem is, that WebSecurity.IsAuthenticated seems to return false after several minutes.  </p>  <p>I need to reload a protected page where i got explicit approving by  WebSecurity.RequireAuthenticatedUser() for the session to be refreshed.</p>  <p>Meaning i dont need to login again, just need to load (no matter which) page with  WebSecurity.RequireAuthenticatedUser() in it, so that the content within @if(WebSecurity.IsAuthenticated) { ... } is getting accessible in another page for another several minutes before its getting inaccessible again.</p>  <p>FYI i'm using</p>  <pre><code>&lt;system.web&gt;    &lt;authentication mode="Windows" /&gt;    &lt;sessionState timeout="9999" mode="InProc"&gt;&lt;/sessionState&gt; &lt;/system.web&gt; </code></pre>  <p>within my web.config and i already tried with SQLServer mode.</p>  <p>Beside information may be, that i read about short time application pool cycles, which could be resposible for that, but why would WebSecurity.RequireAuthenticatedUser() refresh the session though ?</p>  <p>I also read that WebSecurity.IsAuthenticated won't work until a page is fully loaded, but it does work for several minutes until it doesn't for a reason i cant find out :(</p>  <p>Tell me if you need further information.</p>  <p>Thanks for your help and sorry for my bad english :S</p>  <p>best regards, Michael</p>
