<p>I am using "connect-timeout": "^1.7.0" as a top-level middleware in my express.js 4.12 ("express": "^4.12.3") app. I have no problem in using it as such. I can set the timeout to 50 seconds, 5 seconds, 1 second, all of which function perfectly fine. HOWEVER, I'm noticing that if I set the connect-timeout timeout value to anything greater than 110 seconds, the app will still timeout after 110 seconds with the following message: "HTTP request was terminated because the script did not produce output for 110 seconds"</p>  <p>Is there some other setting that needs to be adjusted? I can't find any reference of such a setting. Any help or insight would be very much obliged! Let me know if you need any more info from me. Thanks!</p>  <p>Best, Chris</p>  <p>(Do not worry that the process itself is taking more than 110 seconds, this is intended behavior)</p>
