<p>I have a php script which do calculation and will update a table with nearly a thousand records and probably will take few mins to complete the update. I encounter network timeout error when running the script which i think its the php or mysqli timeout error. </p>  <p>Questions: </p>  <ol> <li><p>What is the best approach to handle the update script if you have more than thousand records?</p></li> <li><p>Is it possible to apply a loading bar which tells the user how many percents have been completed?</p></li> </ol>
