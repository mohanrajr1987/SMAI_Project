<p>My team manages a Nexus repository used by many other teams in my company. A team is using it to store large archive files (mostly 1.6GB, sometimes 4.5GB) and that has been mostly fine, but now they are getting strange behaviour where they get a 504 Gateway Timeout on files that definitely exist. After some time, the files will become available, as if they have been downloaded. It might be recent uploads, or from several days ago, it seems fairly random. </p>  <p>I understand this error occurs with proxy repositories if the remote repo is slow, but this is hosted! How can it have a timeout error retrieving a file on disk?</p>  <p>These errors do not appear in the logs at all, are shown in a box in the GUI, and it seems like it's coming from some kind of front-end talking to a back-end which is slow. There are no other relevant entries in the log file that explain why hosted files were slow to retrieve. Is there some kind of loading or hashing happening that would cause this, and can we turn it off or at least monitor it? </p>  <p>This is causing builds to break frequently in a major project and we can't even monitor when and how often it happens because there is no logs. </p>  <p>Our Nexus version is a bit old, 2.6.4-02, is upgrading likely to fix? We need a solution that is either fast or has a good chance of working. </p>  <p>Thanks in advance. </p>
