<p>what I'm trying to achieve is forwarding a domain to a subdirectory of my web server.<br> I need to have several 3rd party domains pointing to the same content whit preserving the link structure. </p>  <p>So no matter if I type in <code>example.com/page1</code> or <code>example.nl/page1</code> or <code>example.eu/example1</code> there should be always the same content.  </p>  <p>Any ideas how to achieve that? </p>
