<p>I've never seen this issue before, and I have tried googling the hell out of it. Unfortunately I can't come up with unique enough search terms to not get a lot of generic speed tests and malware stuff.</p>  <p>My issue is that whenever I load any page, I always get a wait period. It can be an extra 1s and sometimes as bad as 10s. After the page initially loads, then its fine afterward. </p>  <p>That made me think its dns, so I updated my dns to googles' 4.4.4.4 but that didn't change anything at all. What else can I try?</p>
