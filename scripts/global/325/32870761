<p>I was unable to find existing answers on this topic.</p>  <p>I am running a redis client that connects to a remote redis server (not on the same host).</p>  <p>I can connect either via the domain name or via the server's IP, i.e. I can launch the client either via <code>redis-cli -h 123.123.123.123</code> or <code>redis-cli -h my.domain.com</code>. It is more convenient to use the domain name.</p>  <p>Speed is important for my use case, therefore I would like to know whether the "costly" DNS lookup happens only once at startup or multiple times throughout the life of the client.</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
