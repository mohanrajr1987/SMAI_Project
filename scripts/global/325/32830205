<p>To my knowledge all versions of Chrome running on all platforms have this feature.</p>  <p>Feature basically is issuing three random-looking DNS queries upon start (and some people claim also periodically while running under certain circumstances) to find out if DNS server resolves successfully all DNS queries, including ones for non-existent domain names.</p>  <p>It looks like a sketchy behavior and lots of people freak out suspecting malware or something wrong. </p>  <p>Unfortunately, random-looking DNS queries is really a good (i.e. has low percentage of false positives) indicator of malware, which often uses this trick to communicate back to command &amp; control servers to download malicious payload and newer versions of attacking malware.</p>  <p>So if you have an advanced IDS in your environment that watches for this behavior to detect malware AND many of your users use Chrome, it effectively renders this indicator useless.</p>  <p>It looks like this (sorry, don't have enough reputation to post images, but basically these are www.sfklj202sf2js8fj2l.com queries) in a network capture and you can easily recreate this in your environment with Google Chrome and Fiddler or any other network capture software, like wireshark or MNM or message analyzer.</p>  <p>There are a lot of discussions of this behavior on the Internet (example search query "Google Chrome random DNS queries" in your favorite search engine), but none of them concerns about controlling this. There are several questions on how to turn it off on Google Chrome support forum, but they remain unanswered.</p>  <p>I tried to browse through Chrome's advanced settings and about:flags, but haven't found any control that would allow me to disable this "feature". I disabled all privacy stuff that might be related like "DNS prefetching", but it doesn't stop random-looking DNS queries.</p>  <p>I know that Chrome has tons of config files in user's profile that we aren't supposed to touch. I wonder, if there's a way to stop Chrome from doing this and how? Any input is appreciated, including speculations, because I'm desperate here and expect that there could be no solution here unless Google decides to fix it by introducing a new setting to control this behavior...</p>
