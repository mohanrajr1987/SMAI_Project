<p>I am writing a code to pass domain name and ip address from file to dns resolver query. But it does not seem to be working</p>  <pre><code>import dns.resolver import os import sys  d = open(str(sys.argv[1]),'r') #contains the domain name list ip = open(str(sys.argv[2]),'r') # contain the list of ip address as dns resolver   domain_list = d.readlines() ip_list = ip.readlines() my_resolver = dns.resolver.Resolver() output_f = open("output.txt",'a') for nameserv in ip_list:         my_resolver.nameservers = [nameserv]         for domain in domain_list:                 try:                         answer = my_resolver.query(domain)                         entry = "server : " + "   " + nameserv + " " + "query_result " + str(answer) + '\n'                         output_f.write(entry)                 except :                         print domain,nameserv                         print "no domain"   d.close() ip.close() output_f.close() </code></pre>  <p>My ip address list contains 8.8.8.8 and 127.0.1.1 which are both valid dns resolvers. domain list contain www.facebook.com,www.urltrends.com etc Still i am getting error that no domain exists.</p>
