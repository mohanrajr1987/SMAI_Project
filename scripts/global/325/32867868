<p>I have a few WCF Web Services that I would like to test in Azure's staging area instead of deploying directly to the production area.  </p>  <p>Here's the setup:</p>  <p>I have two cloud services <a href="https://1.cloudapp.net" rel="nofollow">https://1.cloudapp.net</a> and <a href="https://2.cloudapp.net" rel="nofollow">https://2.cloudapp.net</a>.  These cloud service endpoints are endpoints in a traffic manager <a href="https://mycloudapps.trafficmanager.net" rel="nofollow">https://mycloudapps.trafficmanager.net</a>.  I have a DNS alias of <a href="https://mycloudapps.com" rel="nofollow">https://mycloudapps.com</a> mapped to the traffic manager url.</p>  <p>My client is setup to establish an SSL connection using the certificate for <a href="https://mycloudapps.com" rel="nofollow">https://mycloudapps.com</a>.  </p>  <p>When I deploy to staging I edit my host file to use the staging ip to point to <a href="https://mycloudapps.com" rel="nofollow">https://mycloudapps.com</a> and if I ping <a href="https://mycloudapps.com" rel="nofollow">https://mycloudapps.com</a> I get the staging areas ip returned.  Yet when I call the services with my test client I am still hitting the endpoints behind the traffic manager url.</p>  <p>Additionally, I have tried mapping the traffic manager url to the same virtual ip of the staging environment - but I get the same result.</p>  <p>How can I call wcf services in Azure's staging environment in this scenario?</p>  <p>I haven't had much luck on the web... Any help would be appreciated.</p>
