<p>I'm running 2 domains on a single mail-server with 1 IP. The first domain, let's call it a.com, is set on the rDNS and therefore has no problem with sending mails.</p>  <p>The second domain b.com, therefore will often be recognized as spam because the SPF record does not to be right..  following problem with the SPF:</p>  <pre><code>[SPF] b.com does not allow your server xx.xx.xx.xx to use user@b.com  What we retained as your current SPF record is:  v=spf1 mx ptr ptr:xx.xx.xx.xx include:a.com -all More information about this error:  b.com: Junk encountered in mechanism 'ptr:xx.xx.xx.xx' </code></pre>  <p>My SPF entries for a.com:</p>  <pre><code>v=spf1 mx ptr ptr:94.242.255.169 include:skuuup.net -all </code></pre>  <p>and for b.com:</p>  <pre><code>v=spf1 mx ptr ptr:94.242.255.169 include:wiiireopen.com -all  </code></pre>  <p>I would be thankful if you guys can help me out on this one. I tried to understand the SPF annotation but didn't find an article which explains the whole SPF system well enough.</p>
