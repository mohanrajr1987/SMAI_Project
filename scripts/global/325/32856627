<p>I'm running an app on a VM instance (instance-1) and would like myproject.appspot.com requests to be served by instance-1.  </p>  <p>I read <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/modules/routing" rel="nofollow">https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/modules/routing</a> but it wasn't clear.  Is there a way to say "send all traffic to my one instance"?</p>  <p>If I go to my (ephemeral) external IP address for that instance, I can see the server.  But, that won't work for an oAuth2 domain (no IP addresses allowed), so I need it to go through the named domain.</p>  <p>I'd be ok if I could use something constant like instance-1-dot-myproject.appspot.com but would prefer the base myproject.appspot.com to say "any instances?  great!  use that."</p>
