<p>For a particular development task, I need this mapping to happen:</p>  <p><code>mysub.myservice.com/a/b/* -&gt; localhost/*</code></p>  <p><code>mysub.myservice.com/anything else</code> should route as normal.</p>  <p>What is the simplest way to set this up on OSX? I tried <code>dnsmasq</code> but I couldn't figure out how to get this specific mapping to work.</p>  <p>I'm on OSX 10.10.</p>
