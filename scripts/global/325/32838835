<p>I have been experiencing some trouble when using cPanel and DKIM keys at my DNS provider.</p>  <p>The problem (From their opinion) was that my DKIM key inside the TXT file made all other DNS records stop working when the DKIM key expired (after 7 days)</p>  <p>My question is:</p>  <p>Is this true-> Will an expired TXT DKIM record make my A, Cname and MX records stop working ?</p>
