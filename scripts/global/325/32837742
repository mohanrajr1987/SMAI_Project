<p>There is a webpage. Users have their own profiles there. I need to allow users to have a deep link to their profiles. The easiest way is to use my webpage domain + user name. www.mywebpage.com/user-x</p>  <p>The question is if it is possible to allow users to bind their own domains to their profile urls on my web page.</p>  <p>E.g. www.user-x.com should point to www.mywebpage.com/user-x so that user can see the same page by navigating either to www.user-x.com or www.mywebpage.com/user-x </p>
