<p>I have created a WordPress project in my localhost, this is working.</p>  <p>I sent my project to git repository for hosting this in my <code>VPS</code>, I cloned the project in my <code>VPS</code> and imported my local database to remote database.</p>  <p>My Wordpress is hosting in remote, but why when I try access admin area with url <code>hwsystem.com.br/wp-admin</code>, this redirecting me to <code>http://localhost/wp-login.php?redirect_to=http%3A%2F%2Fhwsystem.com.br%2Fwp-admin%2F&amp;reauth=1</code> ?</p>  <p>How can I fix this problem?</p>  <hr>  <p>I found where the problem is!</p>  <p>This problem is because I import database of my local database, where <code>options_value</code> of <code>options_name</code> in <code>wp_options</code> table is <code>http://localhost</code>, I just change it to my remote domain and is working.</p>
