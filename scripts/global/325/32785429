<p>We are trying to detect that a new signup is or is not using Office 365 based off of their email address.</p>  <p>It's easy to identify the mx record domains used for Office 365 "UNIQUE_TOKEN.mail.protection.outlook.com", so searching for '<strong>.mail.protection.outlook.com</strong>' seems like the thing to do.</p>  <p><strong>Question: are there other "Exchange Online" services that use this MX record format that are NOT Office 365?</strong></p>  <p>I think that Office 365 inherited this MX record schema from other services, and that there could still be some other services that actively use it.  But I'm having a hard time confirming it.</p>
