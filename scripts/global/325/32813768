<p>Example</p>  <p>Let's say we have a domain www.example.com.</p>  <p>This domain points to Heroku and we have functional website.</p>  <pre><code>example.herokuapp.com www.example.com </code></pre>  <p>When we load the website</p>  <pre><code>www.example.com </code></pre>  <p>our website works and succesfully loading App on Heroku. Let's say it is running a Django framework (Python Environment)</p>  <p>There is another website that has different IP and is built in Ruby Rails for example and is running on different host provider.</p>  <p>If we load the website www.example.com, we are on the homepage, we can easily browse different pages like about, photos, videos etc.</p>  <p>Is there a possibility if I type</p>  <pre><code>www.example.com/store/ </code></pre>  <p>that it would load that ruby rails website?</p>  <p>Let's remove possibilty moving the app from different provider to heroku or any other provider that www.example.com is on (or precisly were example.com points to in DNS). </p>  <p>Is it possible to map it somehow or point it in DNS to make it work like that?</p>
