<p>I'm hosting a node app on the google compute engine. My app is set to listen to the port 8080. I opened up a firewall to allow tcp connections to port 8080. I can connect to my app by entering </p>  <pre><code>http://&lt;your-instance-ip&gt;:8080  </code></pre>  <p>in the google chrome browser, where your-instance-ip is the external ip of the compute engine instance. I bought a domain. <strong>I want to make it so that when you enter my domain, it redirects you to this specific port</strong>. But you can only add the external ip in the A-record of my godaddy domain. How do I route all traffic to that ip, to the specific port 8080? I used nodejs with express. I want to do this using NGINX, could someone point out some tutorials?</p>
