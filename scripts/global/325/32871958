<p>I have one .IN domain name currently registered with GoDaddy, and I am looking to transfer it to  another service. Also, the domain is protected by CloudFlare i.e my domain nameservers are those provided by CloudFlare rather than GoDaddy default, which moves my DNS record/Zone file management from GoDaddy to CloudFlare.</p>  <p>Right now I'm considering below two options: 1. Transfer my domain from GoDaddy to Enom($25/year) or Namecheap(Rs 574/year)</p>  <ol start="2"> <li>Transfer my domain from GoDaddy to DNSimple($5/month) which in turn registers the domain on enom for $25/year.</li> </ol>  <p>Note, I will still be using CloudFlare after domain transfer.</p>  <p>I don't understand what service will DNSimple provide in 2nd option when my domain is registered to Enom and DNS record management is done on CloudFlare Dashboard.</p>  <p>Does DNSimple just provide an easy &amp; cool interface for DNS zone file management?</p>  <p>Thanks for your help!</p>
