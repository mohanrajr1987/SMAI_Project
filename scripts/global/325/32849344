<p>I'm need to deploy an authoritative name server using and I've found <a href="https://github.com/miekg/dns" rel="nofollow"><code>miekg/dns</code></a> package to almost fit the bill  but I can't find how to store/persist records (i.e. on disk ). Currently it seems to store everything in a map but I guess it's all gone when the server is shut down. Is there anything I'm missing or an easy way to plugin a persistent storage engine ?</p>
