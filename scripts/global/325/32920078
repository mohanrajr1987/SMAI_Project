<p>I presently bought two new domains one .nu and one .dk. TTL for both were set to 360. I used the same registrant i always have (bringing my total number of domains up to 7) I am personally using googles dns servers and the .nu domain showed up after about 5 hours. however the .dk one has not yet showed up (i am using nslookup to check) and at the time i am writing this its been roughly 42 hours since it was registered. I'v checked and rechecked and both domain settings are identical from TTL to target ip. I'v allso tryed updating the serial for the domain. do you guys have any idea what might be going on? or what i might have missed?</p>
