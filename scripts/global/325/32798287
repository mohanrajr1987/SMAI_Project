<p>I understand that my question is certainly not specific to dns.lookup function but can someone explain to me the returned object ? </p>  <pre><code>&gt; dns.lookup("google.com",function(err, address, family){}); &gt; { callback: { [Function: asyncCallback] immediately: true },     family: 0,     hostname: 'google.com',     oncomplete: [Function: onlookup],     domain:      { domain: null,        _events: { error: [Function] },        _maxListeners: undefined,        members: [] } } </code></pre>
