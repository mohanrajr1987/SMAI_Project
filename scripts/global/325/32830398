<p>We are starting our Bluemix IoT infrasctructure with IoTF and I am wondering about DNS issues in my devices. When I ship my IoT devices with a pre-configured organization ID, which is generated by Bluemix like <code>orgid.messaging.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com</code>, how can I customize this address to <code>mqtt.myorganization.com</code> to have the ability to create other IoT instances without re-configuring my device?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
