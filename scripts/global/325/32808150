<p>Scenario: Proxmox 3.4 with 4 VM on OVH</p>  <p>I migrated 3 VM from an old server to a new one with no problems.</p>  <p>Today I migrated the last one, the migration with vzrestore was succesfully terminated. I moved the IP failover on the new machine (1 IP + 1 block of 8 ip), now I can access via Plesk to the server (plesk has a dedicated IP address) but I cannot access to any hosted web site via web:</p>  <p>I get ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED</p>  <p>HTTP request header:  HEAD / HTTP/1.1   User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; <a href="http://www.kloth.net/services/srvinfo.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.kloth.net/services/srvinfo.php</a>)   Host: MYIPADDRESS X  Accept: <em>/</em>  Connection: Close  This does not work, sorry. Connection timed out (110) HTTP response header from MYIPADDRESS X : Connection timed out (110) </p>  <p>On proxmox 3.4 all looks fine and on plesk 12 too.</p>  <p>Any tips? thx</p>
