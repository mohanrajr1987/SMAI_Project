<p>I am currently setting up <strong>TP LINK tl-wa850re</strong> repeater to work with Wi-Fi router <strong>ZYXEL vmg1312-b30b</strong>.</p>  <p>I followed the manual on the repeater, and selected a different SSID for the repeater so I know to which device I am connected to at the moment.</p>  <p>Right now, I am able to connect to both networks, but the repeater one is not able to connect to the internet despite the showing status in repeater web admin:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/u32lS.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/u32lS.png" alt="Repeater status"></a></p>  <p>When I simply enter URL into browser while connected to repeater (<strong>wifinka_ext</strong>), it looks that the DNS is not resolved, so I tried switching back to <strong>wifinka</strong> (router) and pinging www.google.com to get the IP and then switching to <strong>wifinka_ext</strong> and pinging the IP directly like so:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/CVRV2.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/CVRV2.png" alt="ping on www.google.com"></a></p>  <p>So this doesn`t look like DNS server issue, I also tried switching the band width of the repeater to 20Hz and 40Hz with no effect. Here is the log information:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/NvbTT.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/NvbTT.png" alt="Repeater system log"></a></p>  <p>I really ran out of ideas there, any help?</p>
