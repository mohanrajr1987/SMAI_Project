<p>We're trying to set up Cloudflare prior to our launch. We initially registered our domain with Route 53 and want to keep it there... For context, our servers are hosted by DigitalOcean</p>  <p>We set up Cloudflare and went through the flow about 24 hours ago. We changed the NS entries on Route 53 to Cloudflare.</p>  <p>However, when we go to sites like <a href="http://www.whoishostingthis.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.whoishostingthis.com/</a>, it's still showing Digital Ocean.</p>  <p>We also have a subdomain - c.opencritic.com - for our image deploy pipeline. This is showing similar results.</p>  <p>Here are our current entries:</p>  <p><strong>ON ROUTE 53</strong></p>  <ul> <li>A - opencritic.com - IP of server</li> <li>MX - opencritic.com - Gmail web servers</li> <li>NS - opencritic.com -Cloudflare name servers</li> <li>SOA - opencritic.com - long Amazon string during setup</li> <li>CNAME - c.opencritic.com - Alias of opencritic.com</li> <li>CNAME - www.opencritic.com - Alias of opencritic.com</li> </ul>  <p><strong>ON CLOUDLFARE</strong></p>  <ul> <li>A - opencritic.com - IP of server</li> <li>CNAME - c.opencritic.com - Alias of opencritic.com</li> <li>CNAME - www.opencritic.com - Alias of opencritic.com</li> </ul>  <p>What are we missing?? Why aren't we being routed through Cloudflare?</p>  <p>Cheers, Matthew</p>
