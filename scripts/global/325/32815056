<p>I'm having a really hard time configuring cloudflare properly so any help is much appreciated :)</p>  <p>I have an web application that create a unique database for each user, example :</p>  <p>the application is installed on example.com once the user (user1) sign up, is login url will be user1.example.com you can see in live what I'm talking about if you open an account on activecampaign.com</p>  <p>Now the issue is once I set cloudflare DNS example.com is working, I have a forum on a subdomain forum.example.com is working as well because I have added an A record for that subdomain on cloudflare but user1.example.com is not working</p>  <p>Again don't tell me to add an A record for user1 :( because is user1 is not a subdomain the app just create a unique database for each user same like activecampaign app does</p>  <p>Best</p>
