<p>I've set up Prestashop multistore according to the <a href="http://doc.prestashop.com/display/PS15/Managing+Multiple+Shops" rel="nofollow">Prestashop docs</a>. My main domain is margaretdabbs.nl and the other store that I want to manage from this backend is aspadirect.nl/shop. However, none of the guides that I've seen explain what you should actually do on the other domain, they only said what to do for the existing PrestaShop installation.</p>  <p>So my question is: what do I need to do on the other server? Should I install PrestaShop there as well? Set up multistore in the same way?</p>  <p>Or do I need to point the aspadirect.nl nameservers to the original domain (margaretdabbs.nl) and do some DNS-fu?</p>
