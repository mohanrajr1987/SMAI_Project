<p>hi i search almost entire place using google but not found my case i using clone of arduino uno r3 clone compatible  using 4.8v external power for servo</p>  <p>checked with blink example file and found no problem using servo sweep file and it rotate to the very limit but keep pushing if the power still attached, even with declaration .attach(9) on setup the servo rotate to it's boundary</p>  <p>is it about the power input?</p>  <p>can someone help me? will i encounter problem if i starting project using ultrasonic and such? sorry if my english so horrible</p>  <pre><code>#include &lt;Servo.h&gt;  Servo servo1;  void setup() {   // put your setup code here, to run once:   servo1.attach(9);    pinMode(13, OUTPUT); }  void loop() {   // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:   servo1.write(0);  digitalWrite(13,HIGH);  delay(500);  servo1.write(180);  digitalWrite(13,LOW);  delay(500);  } </code></pre>
