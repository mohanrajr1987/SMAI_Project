<p>I am using a Bluetooth HC-6 in my project and I need to <strong>tell whether it's paired or not</strong>.<br> I know there is some way like : look the led on the sensor.<br> led blinking => not pair<br> led not blinking => is paired<br> so I want to know how to get the led signal as an input<br><br> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16005454/tell-when-bluetooth-module-connects-on-arduino/16020652#16020652">Tell when Bluetooth module connects on Arduino</a> <br><br> This article is about HC-5 and I wonder <strong>how to use state pin on HC-6</strong>.<br> I also have searching about the pin <strong>state</strong> on the <strong>HC-6</strong> ,but i just get few information :(<br> By the way, I know that the <code>BTSerial.available()</code> can know whether <strong>the message was sent</strong> or not , but <strong>does the Bluetooth sensor have any function or method to tell the device paired or not?</strong><br><br> Thank you for your reading. :D</p>
