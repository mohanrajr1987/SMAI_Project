<p>I'm trying to connect to socket.io from arduino. The service works from the browser, but if I try to connect from the arduino, when I look in the node log I created via console.log when a connection happens, the socket is undefined, but picks up the connection. Below is the protocol switching request, which returns a 404 not found, but socket.io does register a connection but doesn't define the socket.</p>  <pre><code>client.print(F("GET /socket.io/1/websocket/")); client.print(sid); client.println(F(" HTTP/1.1")); client.print(F("Host: ")); client.print(hostname);  client.fastrprint(F(":")); char portBuffer[10]; itoa(port, portBuffer, 10); client.fastrprint(portBuffer);  client.print(F("Sec-WebSocket-Key: ")); //dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ== client.print(F("dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==")); client.println(F("Origin: ArduinoSocketIOClient")); client.println(F("Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: chat, superchat")); client.println(F("Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13")); client.println(F("Upgrade: websocket")); client.println(F("Connection: Upgrade\r\n")); </code></pre>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/WlIVQ.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/WlIVQ.png" alt="Here is a screenshot of the output from it trying to reconnect over and over."></a></p>  <p>I was thinking maybe I formed the request incorrectly, but I can't find any information for the socket.io protocol switching request so I don't know what to change. What I have done is loosely based on what I read in web socket protocol stand.</p>
