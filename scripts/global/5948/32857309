<p>I was wondering if it would be possible to power a dual relay shield on just the Arduino's analog/digital pins. I know you are supposed to connect one to the ground and another to the 5V VCC port but all the ports are taken up by other components I cannot spare. I don't know if it will draw too much current, but if it won't short my Arduino I can send the positive signal, just a bit unsure of the grounding in the code.</p>  <p>Thank you</p>
