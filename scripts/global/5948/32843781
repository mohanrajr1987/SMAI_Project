<p>I have an Arduino CPU connected to an Android app as USB accessory through ADK. I am able to read/write from/to the USB accessory. My problem occurs in the following scenario:</p>  <p>I have different apps that need to use the connected accessory. All of them have an intent filter for the USB ATTACH action so when I plug the accessory, the pop up appears to choose which app will handle the intent. The problem appears when I choose e.g. the app1 to open but then I need to use the accessory with the e.g. app2. I get an error: <blockquote>"User has not given permission to accessory"</blockquote> Which eventually means that currently only one app can use the accessory.</p>  <p>How can this be solved? Or maybe, as an alternative, would it be better if all the USB accessory-related functions, data etc are processed through something completely independent (maybe a service?) and then returned back to the specific app?</p>
