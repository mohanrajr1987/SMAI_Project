I can install the driver and on device manager it shows Arduino Uno (COM5).</p></li> <li><p>Then I run IDE, the serial monitor is empty, in tools tab, Port: "COM5" is showing, but Serial Port has greyed out.</p></li> <li><p>When uploading, the error message shows: </p>  <p>avrdude: ser_open(): can't set com-state for "\.\COM5"</p></li> </ol>  <p>I tried many solutions online, sometimes there is additional message saying it cannot find the file specified.</p>  <p>I have spent many hours trying to identify the problem, installed/uninstalled many things, searched solutions for a long time, tried the same thing on Win 7 laptop.
