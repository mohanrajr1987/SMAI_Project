<p>I know this is unrelated but still please try to answer it.</p>  <ul> <li>List item</li> </ul>  <p>Hi. I have an Arduino Uno and I am using arduino 1.0.5 IDE. I followed he procedures for bootloading an atmega328P-PU on a breadboard using an Arduino Uno from the link: </p>  <p><a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ArduinoToBreadboard" rel="nofollow">https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ArduinoToBreadboard</a></p>  <p>I uploaded the ArduinoISP sketch first, made the connections(using the External Oscillator) and then wired it up. Then, I selected the programmer as Arduino as ISP, selected the board as Arduino duemilanove w/ Atmega328P . Then I selected the correct serial port and clicked Burn Bootloader.  I got the following errors:</p>  <p>avrdude.exe: stk500_program_enable(): protocol error, expect=0x14, resp=0x50avrdude.exe: initialization failed, rc=-1              Double check connections and try again, or use -F to override              this check.avrdude.exe: stk500_disable(): protocol error, expect=0x14, resp=0x51</p>  <p>How to solve this issue? Also, can I upload the bootloader directly by using it on the Uno in place of the original chip. If so, how?</p>
