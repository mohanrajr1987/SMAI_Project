<p>I have been reading and rereading the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoGSMShield" rel="nofollow">GSM Board</a> site, and trying the sample codes on the Arduino IDE. I couldn't find how to get the default APN and SIM identrifier on the card. </p>  <p><strong>Q:</strong> How does one obtain the <em>default</em> APN (Access Point Name) and the SIM identifier information from the SIM card?</p>
