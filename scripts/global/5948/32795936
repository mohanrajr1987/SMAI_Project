<p>I have made an Java Application that it runs on a Udoo (with Ubuntu) and it connects to Arduino Serial port '/dev/ttymxc3' using RxTx Library.  I have 3 different case that system gets:</p>  <p>1) No Port Found 2) It connects right, but it doesn't receive nothing i the Buffer.</p>  <p>3) When there is 2nd case, i add the possibility of the port to be read from everyone using .   sudo chmod 777 /dev/ttymxc3  I reboot Udoo and i receive Data correctly, but sometimes also it doesn't work.</p>  <p>What I have to do?  I have tried the Program also in a  Windows pc and all works. Thank you.</p>
