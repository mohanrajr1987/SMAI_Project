<p>I have the following problem. I am using WS2811 diodes, Arduino Due and node.js to my project. I want to stream video from a device connected to a node.js server and show it on array of diodes. Right now I am able to capture video from any device with browser and camera, change resolution of the video to this desired by me (15x10) and create String chain containing informations of all colors (R,G,B) of all diodes. I am sending it from node.js server to arduino though serial port with baud rate 115200. Unfortunately sending process it is too slow. I would like it to refresh the LED array at least 10 times per second. So I was wondering maybe to compress this string which I am sending to arduino, when it gets there decompress it, and set colors to diodes. Maybe you guys have some experience with similar project and advice me what to do.</p>  <p>For handling diodes I am using adafruit_neopixel library.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance ;)</p>
