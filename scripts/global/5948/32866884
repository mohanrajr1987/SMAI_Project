<p>In a previous code of mine, I was using the following line of code to get the last 9digits of the "command" string</p>  <pre><code>if(command.indexOf("kitchen light: set top color") &gt;=0)  {OnColorValueRed = (command.charAt(28)- 48)*100 + (command.charAt(29)- 48)*10 + (command.charAt(30)- 48);} </code></pre>  <p>Now i am using a char buffer (char packetBuffer[UDP_TX_PACKET_MAX_SIZE];) and using the above code does not work since packetBuffer is not a string, how could I please go about this</p>
