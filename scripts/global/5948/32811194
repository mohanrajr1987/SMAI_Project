<p>I am working on IoT and planning to use Ardiuno Boards for that and PARSE cloud to store data on Cloud. But in the site parse.com it is showing that only Ardiuno Zero and Aurdiuno Yun boards. So is it only these boards can be used to send data on cloud. Similarly is happening with TI CC3200 development board, so am I bound to use these boards or I can use any development kit.
