<p>I have an Arduino UNO (or mega2560) and I want to use both usb host and ethernet shield. I know both shields use SPI to communicate with main board. By following some guides on how to use multiple slave and masters by separating SS pins, I've changed SS pin of usb host (from default PIN10) to PIN 6. I did it by wiring SS interface pad to PIN6 and also I've cut solder jumper of that interface. After that, i changed default ss pin in usbCore.h in usbHost_Shield_ver2 library by changing following line:</p>  <pre><code>typedef MAX3421e&lt;P10, P9&gt; MAX3421E; </code></pre>  <p>to</p>  <pre><code>typedef MAX3421e&lt;P8, P9&gt; MAX3421E; </code></pre>  <p>When I connect JUST usb host shield to UNO I can use it on pin 8 and 10 (if I change above line in usbCore.h again), But when I connect Ethernet shield nothing runs... :( So, I was wondering If anybody can help me about how I can solve the problem. Thanks</p>
