<p>I know PHP session default value is 24 minutes. This is I ensured from the phpinfo(); But My session is not expired till I close the browser. I am using XAMPP on Windows 7 machine.</p>  <p>Below is my php session values</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/VICtQ.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/VICtQ.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>My question is not to increase or decrease the session time. Why it is not expired after 24 minutes.</p>
