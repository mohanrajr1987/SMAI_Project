<p>I need to develop a website on ASP.NET and an android application. Both applications share the same mysql database. I was wandering if there's a way to run ASP.NET on either WAMP or XAMPP server? If there isn't, how do I connect the mysql database on WAMP or XAMPP server to the ASP.NET web application? Please help. Very confused. </p>
