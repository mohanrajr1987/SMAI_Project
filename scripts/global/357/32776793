<p>I'm doing a web project which facilitates uploading and downloading documents along with edit logs. The basic layout of the website is registering with email and uploading documents. If a user wants to download a document uploaded by another user, he has to give a link for it. I'm using MySql along with Xampp server. </p>  <p>I'm not able to understand the technology, languages to be used for it. </p>  <ol> <li><p>I can upload documents using PHP. I need to maintain a history of uploaded documents too and show it on the page. How do I achieve that?</p></li> <li><p>How do I share documents for downloading? I can't seem to figure it out. </p></li> <li><p>How do I maintain the edit logs? </p></li> </ol>  <p>It'll be really helpful if you could guide me. Many thanks! </p>
