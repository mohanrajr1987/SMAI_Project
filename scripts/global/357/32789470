<p>I'm making a sample page with php, and it's respective database with MySQL, In it, I ask for the user to insert the password and some other data(name, email...), I wan't to encrypt the password. I have the algorithm in a .Py file I made before, so I want to in some way insert it or make it work with the php so the password is revieved but not stored untill it is encrypted, and the so. Can I mix my files so it happen? I've heard of Python-Sql but I am not pretty sure it'll work.</p>
