<p>I have downloaded and installed XAMPP for Mac OS X (latest version) in my new macbook pro. I already have projects from my previous laptop (Windows) so I decided to migrate them in my macbook.</p>  <p>I have downloaded the source files from my repository and stored them at $HOME/Documents/Projects/my-project</p>  <p>When I was still using Windows, I don't really use the htdocs folder. Instead I am using the Alias directive. </p>  <p>But when I configured everything in the macbook for me to use the Alias, I'm getting the 403 Forbidden error.</p>  <p>I have searched for almost a day and still could't figure out a way of how to solve my problem.</p>  <p>Here are what I have done:</p>  <p>I modified /Applications/XAMPP/etc/http.conf and encoded this at the end of the file.</p>  <p><code>Alias /sample /Users/myusername/Documents/Projects/my-project &lt;Directory "/Users/myusername/Documents/Projects/my-project"&gt;     Options Indexes FollowSymlinks MultiViews ExecCGI     Order allow,deny     Require local     AllowOverride All     Allow from all &lt;/Directory&gt; </code></p>  <p>Then changed this:</p>  <p><code>&lt;IfModule unixd_module&gt;    #User daemon    User myusername    Group daemon &lt;/IfModule&gt;</code></p>  <p>Is there something I have done wrong?</p>
