<p>So, here we go with silly question number too many to count!</p>  <p>I've made a very simple PHP contact form using tutorials from the internet (I still need to add security measures to it but I wanted to get it working first) When I click on the send button on my website I do get the message sent script however no email arrives in my in box.</p>  <p>Any ideas what I'm doing wrong? The website is currently hosted locally via XAMPP.</p>  <pre><code>$name = $_POST['name']; $company = $_POST['company']; $email = $_POST['email']; $tel = $_POST['tel']; $message = $_POST['message']; $from = 'From: me@mywebsite.co.uk'; $to = 'me@mywebsite.co.uk'; $subject = 'Enquiry';  $body = "From: $name\n Company: $company\n Email: $email\n Telephone: $tel\n Message: $message\n";  if ($_POST['send']) {     if(mail($to, $subject, $body, $from)) {         echo '&lt;p&gt; Your message has been sent!&lt;/p&gt;';     } else {         echo '&lt;p&gt;Message could not be sent.&lt;br&gt;Please check that you have completed the name, email and message fields and try again&lt;/p&gt;';     } } </code></pre>
