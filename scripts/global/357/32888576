<p>so here's my code</p>  <pre><code>cmd.CommandText = "insert into tbl_project (`sampleField`) values(@sample)";                 cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@sample", DateTime.Now.ToString()); </code></pre>  <p>This is what's happening. When I run my solution/project on the Unit that have the database through xampp. I can perfectly put the right date on the database. But when run the solution/project from a different unit and remotely access the database. The date being saved to my database become 0000, not the correct date. How to fix this. Please help. BTW. I can perfectly remotely insert strings and numbers on the database. the only problem is the date. its becoming null or 0000.</p>
