<p>After a site migration, the home page of new site url loads, but the permalinks all redirect to Apache's(i'm on XAMPP stack) default page:</p>  <pre><code>Object not found!  The requested URL was not found on this server. If you entered the URL manually please check your spelling and try again.  If you think this is a server error, please contact the webmaster.  Error 404  localhost Apache/2.4.16 (Win32) OpenSSL/1.0.1p PHP/5.5.28  </code></pre>  <p>I don't think this is wordpress db issue. otherwise, I would've gotten wordpress's default page not found page.  What else is causing this?  Is there a .htaccess file somewhere that needs to be modified?</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong> I used this script for the db migration:  <a href="https://interconnectit.com/products/search-and-replace-for-wordpress-databases/" rel="nofollow">https://interconnectit.com/products/search-and-replace-for-wordpress-databases/</a></p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong> So added the default .htaccess from <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/htaccess" rel="nofollow">https://codex.wordpress.org/htaccess</a>, and it redirects to xampp's homepage.  So that officially means the permalink structure somewhere in wordpress db/routing is broken(not routing properly).  My new site url is "localhost/somewebsite", where "localhost" is default domain name of my xampp/local dns setup.</p>
