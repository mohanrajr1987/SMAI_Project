<p>I'm trying to make a subdomain for my xampp/apache hosted website. However, whenever I attempt to access the subdomain it gives me an "HTTPS insecure error" and redirects me to the main part of the site. Also, I can still access the main site without any issues at all.</p>  <p>In my 'httpd-vhosts.conf' file, I believe all the entries are correct and the issue lies with my hosts file.</p>  <p>To clarify, this is a website with a premium domain name, (i.e not just a website for local use). Most of the tutorials and guides I can find are only really designed for websites that are used locally only.</p>  <p>Here is my 'httpd-vhosts.conf' file (with my domain name edited out of course):</p>  <pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;     DocumentRoot "C:/xampp/htdocs/"     ServerName domain.xyz     ServerAlias https://domain.xyz     ErrorLog "logs/domain.xyz-error.log"     CustomLog "logs/domain.xyz-access.log" common &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;  &lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;     DocumentRoot "C:/xampp/htdocs/sub1"     ServerName sub1.domain.xyz     ServerAlias https://sub1.domain.xyz     ErrorLog "logs/sub1.domain.xyz-error.log"     CustomLog "logs/sub1.domain.xyz-access.log" common &lt;/VirtualHost&gt; </code></pre>  <p>The entries I have in my hosts file are (which I'm fairly certain is completely wrong):</p>  <pre><code>127.0.0.1   localhost 127.0.0.1   domain.xyz 127.0.0.1   sub1.domain.xyz </code></pre>
