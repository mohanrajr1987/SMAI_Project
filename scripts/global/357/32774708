<p>I want a default value and get rid off the notice. Below is my code </p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php $color = $_POST["color"]; //initialize variable if (!isset($color)){    // if nothing selected set default to Blue     $color = 'Blue'; } echo $color;     ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>So when I run the code and nothing is selected and the blue value (as it is set for default) does show up but the notice message also shows up. I want to get rid of the notice message completely. I have tried array_key_exists as well. Still can not get rid of the notice.</p>  <p>below is the notice I'm getting. Notice: Undefined index: color in C:\xampp\htdocs\test3\Assignment_1_Q2.php on line 17 </p>  <p>Thank you in advance.</p>
