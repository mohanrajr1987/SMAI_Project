<p>Im not sure if stack overflow allows such questions but during my research on google i came across some users here asking similar questions(none of their solutions worked) so i decided to ask this question.</p>  <p>I have a Ethernet that comes into my computer , now i use a third-party app to make a hot spot so i can connect a few other devices. What i wanted to achieve was a home server webpage which would contain family pictures ,videos etc that all those devices connected can access. So i installed xampp and successfully created the webpage and it works on my computer(the one hosting xampp). </p>  <p>But when i try from my android device it says webpage not found? I turned off firewall completely. I don't have a router so i don't have to change anything there. Oh and i edited the hosts on my computer to display this computer's ipV6 as home.net. I tried the same with google and it worked on my android device so i know that the hosts file is not the case. So if the ipv6 address works on my computer shouldn't it work on the other node even if localhost doesn't?</p>  <p>One more thing my public ip address is the  page for my  ISP's login portal for internet usage.</p>
