<p>I'm trying to create a application that doesn't require user input that interacts with the cell company to perform certain actions.</p>  <p>For example, upon noticing I'm lacking funds, or the funds I do have on the phone are about to expire, I can have it automatically update my account so I can make calls without much worry. (this is an example, not the story so don't try to give suggestions like "get an unlimited calling plan")</p>  <p>The problem I'm having is that I'd like to have to leave the app running on my home computer or server, that would have a more stable network connection and then have it make the necessary checks and send information to my service provider(cell company) when it needs to.</p>  <p>So say I need to update my funds the normal method.</p>  <p>I would  go on my phone and type</p>  <pre><code>*600*[insert 19 digit card number here]# </code></pre>  <p>This would then add the value of the card to my account for the phone.</p>  <p>What I want to be able to to find out out what instructions I what the code would be if I didn't send this from a phone but from a app on a server.</p>  <p>A friend suggested combing for the API however I'm newbie trying to learn as a I do interesting projects. </p>  <p>I tried googling about combing APIs but nothing showed up about how going about this.</p>  <p>Maybe I'm in over my head, however, either way I'd love if someone is able to help me understand what combing the API for my provider would involve?</p>
