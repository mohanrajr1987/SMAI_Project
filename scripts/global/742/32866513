<p>I'm search a library that could display PDF files inside a webpage. It have to work in desktop browsers and mobile. I would like to search text inside PDF (pdf/a) and draw figures over it like colored rectangles (for example some canvas).</p>  <p>I found <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/" rel="nofollow">PDF.JS</a> by mozilla that works good with desktop but it didn't works very well on mobile, above all on ipad and iOS. Same situation with  <a href="http://viewerjs.org/" rel="nofollow">ViewerJS</a>.</p>  <p>I tried to insert PDF inside canvas but I can't search the text.</p>  <p>Is there other valid solition for web mobile pdf viewer? I will not updload my documents to 3rd part server hosting. </p>  <p>Thank you in advance.</p>
