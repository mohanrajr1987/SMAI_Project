<p>I have a little app to dress dolls, and I want Facebook integration for sharing with my friends. I do this:</p>  <ol> <li><p>Import SDK Unity Package 7.1.0 to my app;</p></li> <li><p>Create my app in Facebook developer, put package name, class name, and debug keyhash in debug key and release key;</p></li> <li><p>Put APP ID in Facebook Setting in Unity;</p></li> <li><p>Put contact mail (Facebook developer), turn alive my app;</p></li> </ol>  <p>I'm trying to adapt the SDK to my code, so I try to see example that came with Facebook SDK 7.1.0. I can log (read permission), share in my time line, but I have invite issues: I press invite button, I can select a friend in facebook account, the facebook SDK example return SUCESSFULL, but the invite never comes to friend.</p>  <p>Can someone help me please? If possible post some invite example to Uunity monobehaviour.</p>  <p>I can't post my main manifest and code here, some issue with CTRL+K.</p>
