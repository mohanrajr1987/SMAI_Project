<p>I'm using a number of the Blogger templates (like Simple, Ethereal, Watermark) and I've just noticed recently that on IPhone 5 using Safari browser that the main content is shifted slightly to the left.  This does not happen with Chrome browser.  It may have happened right after Apple pushed out IOS 9.0 or 9.0.1.  Is anyone still supporting the Blogger templates for such issues or can they suggest some CSS to override this?  This happened when using either fluid width or fixed width setting on the templates.</p>
