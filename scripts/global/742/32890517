<p>the site is up here. www.bridgemarkmedia.com/resume/jeff_fero.html </p>  <p>The desktop version of this site is working just fine, and the mobile version looks fine, but on this mobile site, once you scroll to the bottom of the content you are only about 5% down the page as there is an excessive amount of extra space to scroll down on this mobile version. </p>  <p>I don't currently have a clue why this occurring, so I don't really have any code snippets I can post. I assume the issue is in my mobile.css document, but like I said, I am lost on this one. </p>  <p>** Issue occurs on iPhone 4s. When mobile site is brought up on iPad this issue does not occur **</p>
