<p>During testing we noticed that on mobile devices, any number that is displayed starting with a 0 is recognized as a phone number. How can I keep this from happening?</p>  <p>We have policy number that are listed out in the header. I need them to remain unclickable and white in color instead of becoming a link for mobile users.</p>  <p>There seem to be lots of options for turning phone number recognition off for all pages and all links, but we do actually have phone numbers on the site and need the mobile phone recognition to remain working. I just need to ability to turn it off for this one section of the site - the header.</p>  <p>Any suggestions?</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Edit</p> </blockquote>  <p>Does anyone know how to set a format for numbers I <strong>want</strong> to recognize as phone numbers? That way I wouldn't worry about having to setup this number directly.</p>  <p><em>For example: I only want number that follow this format to be recognized on mobile devices as a phone number</em> - 888.888.8888</p>
