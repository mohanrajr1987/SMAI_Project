<p>I am building a mobile-focused web application, to later convert to hybrid, and I would prefer new user registrations confirm the user's phone number versus their email address. </p>  <p>I would like to send a new user an SMS with a unique code. When they first log in, they must enter that code to activate their account.</p>  <p>I have a custom SMS service, and would like to know how to integrate this into the Identity registration process. </p>  <p>Please note that I do not wish to use SMS for routine two-factor authentication.</p>
