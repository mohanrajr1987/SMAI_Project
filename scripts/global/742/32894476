<p>Developing a Mobile Application that uses CORS REST on the backend. I am parsing data from the back end to populated fields on the front-end.</p>  <p>I am currently using ngCookies to store the sessionId as well as authentication username and password.</p>  <p>When testing in Ripple Emulator CLI, seems everything is ok. When I build for phonegap and test on device, it doesn't seem to be storing the sessionId.</p>  <pre><code>var SessionId = $cookies.get('SessionId'); </code></pre>  <p>Is this the correct way of going about this or is there something else I should be doing? Thank You in advance.</p>
