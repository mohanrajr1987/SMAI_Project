<p>In the process of making a website mobile friendly, but not sure what's stopping an Ignite Image gallery from shrinking.</p>  <p>I've tried changing all of the widths on the containing  tags, and the image itself to max-width but it doesn't seem to have made any difference.</p>  <p>The url is: <a href="http://discus-music.co.uk/juxtavoices#!Juxtavoices_36" rel="nofollow">http://discus-music.co.uk/juxtavoices#!Juxtavoices_36</a></p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
