<p>I came across this prototype while debugging my website in Safari mobile browser. I have a flag in my code to check the container is HTMLDivElement before adding d3 elements. </p>  <p>Thats where i cam across this new Prototype for DOM element - DIV . You can see that in screenshot right side at constructor property. To double check i typed them in console, it surprised me with the error..</p>  <p>When i did google search with "HTMLDivElementConstructor"... there were no information.</p>  <p>My question "HTMLDivElementConstructor" is it for mobile alone ?  This question arrises as my page broke only in Mobile browsers [ chrome and Safari ].And i could only inspect safari mobile browser.... </p>  <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0By6n6D7KyxUaaWd5OW50QldTaXM/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">ScreenShot from my MAC</a></p>
