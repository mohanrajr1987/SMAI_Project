<p>I just have a little question about using SVG with "modern website". I was lately told that using SVG isn't really a good idea because they use the CPU (Is It linked to the fact SVG is in fact vector graphic ?), which might be bad on some mobile devices because of the low CPU they could have.</p>  <p>So is that "true" ? Because I'haven't found any good article talking about that.</p>
