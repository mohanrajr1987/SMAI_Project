<p>I've been practising making webpages that run smooth on mobile. Currently I have a simple front page that works fine on all iphones and samsungs.</p>  <p>I then looked at the webpage on a sony experia and the layout went wrong. The sizes of the screens are very similar so I can't really work out what I have to do to correct the problem.</p>
