<p>I wrote some code for an email advertising campaign my company is about to launch.Code works great on a computer screen, problem is when I load it on my phone, the code is blown up! Is there away to better epitomize my html code? </p>  <p>I would have to use CSS I know, but I cant just attach it to the email, so I need do some inline stuff. </p>  <p>any ideas? </p>  <p>I am using div tags, h1 tags as well as the standard html stuff. I am using px to dictate the size of my images, should I use percent values? But when I do, if someone re-sizes a window on a desktop, it gets all messed up. </p>
