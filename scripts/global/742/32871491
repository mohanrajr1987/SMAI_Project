<p>I have been trying to get this figured out, and IG's dev support isn't super responsive. I have an application that makes use of IG's realtime api. I have working tag and geography subscriptions, but subscriptions for authorized users are not coming through.</p>  <p>I added the user subscription to our subscribed list through this:</p>  <p><code>curl -F 'client_id=XXXXX' \      -F 'client_secret=XXXXX' \      -F 'object=user' \      -F 'aspect=media' \      -F 'callback_url=CALLBACK_URL' \      -F 'access_token=USER_ACCESS_TOKEN' \      https://api.instagram.com/v1/subscriptions/</code></p>  <p>I have a working client ID &amp; Secret and my callback url works as I am receiving notifications for tags and geo tags. However, I am getting absolutely 0 notifications for authorized users. </p>  <p>Ig's response for my subscriptions shows it subscribed as follows:</p>  <p><code>{ object: "user" object_id: null aspect: "media" callback_url: "CALLBACK_URL" type: "subscription" id: "XXXXXXXX" }</code></p>  <p>According to their API docs, <a href="https://instagram.com/developer/realtime/" rel="nofollow">https://instagram.com/developer/realtime/</a> , one user subscription is needed for all of an applications authed users. </p>  <p>If anyone sees anything blatantly wrong any help would be appreciated. </p>  <p>EDIT- </p>  <p>After deleting the subscription and attempting to subscribe again, i was able to get user subscriptions for roughly ten minutes before they stopped and we are back at the same problem.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
