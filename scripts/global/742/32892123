<p>I have some social sharing links to share a post. This has to be in a new popup/tab/window. You know, the box we all know to share something on FB etc.</p>  <p>For desktop a new tab isn' necessary, so I'm using this:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;a href="popup-example.html" target="popup-example" onClick="javascript:open('', 'popup-example', 'height=400,width=400,resizable=no')"&gt; </code></pre>  <p>But now I was asking myself how to make it for mobile devices..</p>  <p>Maybe just a php script to detect if it's desktop, than use example above. If mobile, use <code>&lt;a target="_blank"</code>?</p>  <p>Would this be the right way? Or do I need a mobile hook for the Facebook app for example?</p>
