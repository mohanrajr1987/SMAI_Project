<p>Recently I began exploring developing UI in Qt Designer and editing them through PyQt. Things have been going pretty smoothy, but I'm currently stuck trying to solve the following issue:</p>  <p>I've inserted a MatplotLib widget through Qt Designer and managed to plot pretty well horizontal bars using barh. Next I tried and successfully managed to insert a functional NavigationToolBar through matplotlib.backends.backend_qt4agg.NavigationToolbar2QT</p>  <p>Then, following this thread (and similar ones) I managed to edit which buttons I would like to display on the toolbar... <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12695678/how-to-modify-the-navigation-toolbar-easily-in-a-matplotlib-figure-window">How to modify the navigation toolbar easily in a matplotlib figure window?</a></p>  <p>It works well for every button except for the last one, with a check box drawing which description "Edit curves line and axes parameters". In this particular case, I would really like to remove this button, because it constantly resizes the plot when moving the mouse and in this case I don't need this button.</p>  <p>I haven't found yet any thread discussing this particular toolbar button (just this one <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12445732/matplotlib-qt4agg-toolbars-irritating-bug">matplotlib: Qt4Agg toolbar&#39;s irritating bug</a>)</p>  <p>The code used to insert the toolbar and currently edit buttons looks something like this:</p>  <pre><code>from matplotlib.backends.backend_qt4agg import NavigationToolbar2QT  class currentUI(QtGui.QWidget):      def __init__(self):         super(currentUI,self).__init__()         (...)         uic.loadUi('portfolioManager.ui',self)         self.initUI()         (...)     def initUI(self):                 self.setWidgetsPropertiesAndActions()     (...)     def setWidgetsPropertiesAndActions(self):         (...)         self.navi_toolbar=NavigationToolbar(self.mplwidgetExposures, self)         self.LayoutPlot.addWidget(self.navi_toolbar) (...) class NavigationToolbar(NavigationToolbar2QT):      toolitems = [t for t in NavigationToolbar2QT.toolitems if                  t[0] in ('Home','Pan', 'Zoom', 'Save','Subplots')] </code></pre>  <p>This successfully embeds the toolbar, but the "edit" button remains.</p>  <p>Thanks very much for any insight. Regards</p>
