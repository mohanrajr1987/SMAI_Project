<p>I write a software that uses the PyQt4 library on Windows 7 platform and its works fine. I try to execute the same *.py file on my Osx Yosemite but it show me a Window without widget. Both machine have Python 2.7.1.</p>  <p>P.S.: i install pyqt using:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>brew install qt     brew install sip     brew install pyqt</p> </blockquote>  <p>Where is the problem?</p>
