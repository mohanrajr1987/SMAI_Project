<p>I routinely use PyDev in Eclipse for Python development.  However, I'm trying PyQt for the first time in the same environment.  It works well, with one exception.  If the program errors out anywhere within the Qt main event loop, including within my own code, no error information is output to the PyDev console.</p>  <p>To demonstrate this I created the following simple PyQt app:</p>  <pre><code>import sys from PyQt5 import uic from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication  # test.ui contains a single Push Button named pushButton base, form = uic.loadUiType("../ui/test.ui")   class MainWindow(base, form):     def __init__(self, parent=None):         super(base, self).__init__(parent)         self.setupUi(self)         self.pushButton.clicked.connect(self.button_pressed)      def button_pressed(self):         print('button pressed')         print(invalid_variable) # intentional error         pass  if __name__ == '__main__':     app = QApplication(sys.argv)     app.setStyle("fusion")     main_window = MainWindow()     main_window.show()     sys.exit(app.exec_()) </code></pre>  <p>If I place an intentional error such as <code>print(invalid_variable)</code> anywhere after <code>if __name__ == '__main__':</code> and before the <code>app.exec_()</code> command, the program properly terminates with a traceback and the expected <code>NameError: name 'invalid_variable' is not defined</code>.  However, if I press the button in my dialog using the above code, <code>button pressed</code> appears on the console but then the application terminates silently and with no error information in the console.  Other debugging operations, such as breakpoints and expressions, work fine.</p>  <p>Is this expected behavior?  If so, what do you recommend for facilitating debugging of PyQt apps in this environment.  If not, I'd appreciate insight into what I need to do to rectify the problem.</p>  <ul> <li>Python version: python-3.4.3.amd64 </li> <li>PyDev version: PyDev for Eclipse 4.3.0.201508182223 </li> <li>PyQt version: PyQt5-5.5-gpl-Py3.4-Qt5.5.0-x64</li> </ul>  <hr>  <p>Update <strong>2015-09-30</strong>:</p>  <p>When I run the test app directly with python.exe, it outputs the error correctly to <strong>stderr</strong> in both error scenarios.  So this issue does seem specific to the PyDev environment.  I additionally created an entirely fresh Eclipse workspace with only the Python interpreter configured and ran my test again on a freshly created PyDev project using the same source code.  The results were the same.</p>
