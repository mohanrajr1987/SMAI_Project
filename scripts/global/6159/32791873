<p>Trying to create a function that increments the value of the number entered in my Gui. The function is </p>  <pre><code>def autoIncrement(self):     myNumber = int(self.windowObj.myInt.value()) #This is my QSpinBox and it's value.     selection = cmds.ls(sl=True) #List selected     global myNumber #Setting the global     start = myNumber #Setting the value to be QSpinBox's value.      interval = 1 # Adding 1 interval     for object in selection:         if (myNumber==0):             myNumber= start         else:             myNumber = myNumber + interval #Needs to get the value in my spin box and add +1 to it for the next object selected.             cmds.rename(object, myNumber) </code></pre>  <p>What am I doing wrong? Keep in mind that my number being added in the middle of naming convention and want to avoid Maya to add one in the end. Current naming convention is  NAME_NUMBER_POSITION_LEVEL eg = MF_100_L_HI </p>  <pre><code>Currently it renames but adds number at the end to: MF_100_L_HI MF_100_L_HI1 MF_100_L_HI2 When it should be like: MF_100_L_HI MF_101_L_HI MF_102_L_HI  This is my renaming script: def renamer(self):     myNames = str(self.windowObj.myName.text()) # First field of text (e.g MF)     myLevels= self.windowObj.myLevel.currentText() #Third feild of text (e.g HI)     myPositions= self.windowObj.myPosition.currentText() #Fourth field text (e.g L)     myNumbers= int(self.windowObj.myInt.value()) #Second field of text (The number goes here) (e.g 100)     renamedName = (myNames + "_" + myNumbers + "_" + myPositions + "_" + myLevels)     selection = cmds.ls(sl = True)      for object in selection:         cmds.rename(object, renamedName)         print renamedName </code></pre>
