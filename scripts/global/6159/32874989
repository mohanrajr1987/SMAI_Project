<p>a simple situation is proving fairly tricky.</p>  <p>My target is to get a window to update the status of a widget in another window. To explain:</p>  <p>I have window A with some "data" and I want it written into the textEdit widget of window B. The specifics of the main window and the widgets are </p>  <pre><code>class MainWin(object):     def setupUi(self, MainWindow):         MainWindow.setObjectName(_fromUtf8("MainWindow"))         MainWindow.resize(1127, 880)          self.centralwidget = QtGui.QWidget(MainWindow)         self.centralwidget.setObjectName(_fromUtf8("centralwidget"))         self.textEdit = QtGui.QTextEdit(self.centralwidget)         self.textEdit.setGeometry(QtCore.QRect(20, 150, 1081, 661))         self.textEdit.setObjectName(_fromUtf8("textEdit"))         self.textEdit.isUndoRedoEnabled () </code></pre>  <p>What I am currently failing at obtaining is a simple method which called from another window (and another file) could change the content inside the textEdit. Not sure what I am doing wrong, but when I do try to import the class or a method from the class I always seem to have issue with the </p>  <blockquote>   <p>TypeError: unbound method updEdit() must be called with   MainWin instance as first argument (got nothing instead)</p> </blockquote>  <p>I am very much open to suggestions, and thanks in advance!</p>  <p><strong>Edit #1</strong></p>  <p>from file Rep.py (the second window I am simply calling)</p>  <pre><code>def addTemplate(self):         data = self.textBrowser.toPlainText()         MainWin.MainWin.addText(MainWindow.MainWin,data)         self.close() </code></pre>  <p>From the first window, all I would need to do is:</p>  <pre><code>def addText(self,data):     self.textEdit.setText(data) </code></pre>  <p>I am fairly new to OOP so please forgive me if there's some rather stupid mistake.</p>
