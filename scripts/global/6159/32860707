<p>I Want to create a Windows Desktop Replacement app. something like Bumptop or many other apps do the same thing. i want to use Qt( if it would be pyqt thats the best).  what libraries should i use? is there any example for this? another solution is to create a windowed app which doesn't minmized and always on bottom of other windows.</p>
