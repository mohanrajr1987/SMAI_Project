<p>How can I convert PyQt4 (Python 3) code to an EXE file (without the errors)?</p>  <p>I have tried using: py2exe, PyInstaller, and cx_freeze. py2exe does not work, pyInstaller is unable to install (always some kind of error) and cx_freeze looks like it might work.</p>  <p>I can sucessfully "freeze" a program to an .exe using the following command:</p>  <pre><code>cxfreeze --base-name Win32GUi --include-modules=sip file_name.py </code></pre>  <p>But upon running the file (on another system) I always get an error. I fix one, a different one pops up.</p>  <p>Right now I am getting the following error: </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/qKLjr.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/qKLjr.png" alt="My stupid error"></a></p>  <p>It says DLL Error but really, it's something with the paths messed up. </p>  <p>It expects it will find a dll or a module in the directory of the Python installation (which does not exist because the program was compiled on another system.</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
