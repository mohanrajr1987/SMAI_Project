<p>I have created a program that uses the Scanner to ask the user for int values until they insert -1 which makes the program to stop receiving numbers. After doing so, it will add all the values entered by the user. This is my code so far: </p>  <pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) {     int sum = 0, value, count = 0;        Scanner scan = new Scanner (System.in);       System.out.print ("Enter an integer (-1 to quit): ");       value = scan.nextInt();      String string = Integer.toString(value);     while (value != -1)     {           count = count + 1;           sum = sum + value;           System.out.print("Enter an integer (-1 to quit): ");           value = scan.nextInt();           string = Integer.toString(value);     }       System.out.println ();       if (count == 0)           System.out.println ("No values were entered.");       else       {           System.out.println("Number entered: " + string + ",");         System.out.println ("The sum is " + sum);       }   }   </code></pre>  <p>I want the output to look like this:</p>  <pre><code>Entered numbers: 1,2,3,4,5 //example of number the user might enter The sum is 15 </code></pre>  <p>I wanted to use a String for it to give me the sets of entered numbers, but it only gives me the last entered value. Which is -1 because that is the number that has to be entered to stop the program.</p>  <p>How can I out this problem?</p>
