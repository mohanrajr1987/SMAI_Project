<p>One of the tasks in today's exam was to create an integer array</p>  <pre><code>int arr[N][N]; </code></pre>  <p>where N is an odd number, as in the following examples:</p>  <pre><code>N = 3       N = 5           N = 7  3 2 3     5 4 3 4 5     7 6 5 4 5 6 7 2 1 2     4 3 2 3 4     6 5 4 3 4 5 6 3 2 3     3 2 1 2 3     5 4 3 2 3 4 5           4 3 2 3 4     4 3 2 1 2 3 4           5 4 3 4 5     5 4 3 2 3 4 5                         6 5 4 3 4 5 6                         7 6 5 4 5 6 7 </code></pre>  <p>and so on.</p>  <p>I have been trying to write the correct <code>for</code> loops in order to produce the array, but I have not succeeded.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
