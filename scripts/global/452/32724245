<p>I am a complete (GCSE) beginner in python. I am trying to add the numbers in an integer. My variable FNT comes out as a different number every time (depending on what I have inputted earlier) and I then need the numbers to add themselves.    E.g.   FNT=19  I now need the number to do this-  1+9=10        1+0=1                                                                                                                                                        The numbers need to keep adding themselves until they are a single digit but the number could be different every time. All help is greatly appreciated but, as I said I am a complete beginner and probably won't be able to understand anything too complicated, so would anybody know how to do this?                </p>
