<p>an <code>illegal start of expression</code> error comes up for a private int instantiation. All my <code>()</code> and <code>{}</code> are closed and previous statements have been ended with <code>;</code>. Is there any common reason for this?</p>  <pre><code>private int starting = start;  StringCoder_Driver.java:138: error: illegal start of expression       private int starting = start; </code></pre>
