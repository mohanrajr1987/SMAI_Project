<p>I got a little problem, I get an error:<br> <code>"C2361: initialization of *identifier* is skipped by 'default' label"</code> </p>  <p>I use an internal class member to set the chosen approach used in my methods.<br> The methods use this internal member (<code>static int</code>) with a switch to determine which approach was set.<br> The switch needs an intial value when compiling, so I decided to use a <code>static const int</code>. However, VS is still unhappy, and I can't change the <code>static const int</code> as well. I am pretty sure this ain't a big deal, but it's quite frustrating.</p>  <p>example:</p>  <pre><code>class test{     public:     static int Val;     static void setVal(int val);     static int doStuff(void); };  test::setVal(int val){     Val=val; }  test::doStuff(){     switch(Val){     case 1:     // do stuff     case 2:     // do other stuff     default:     // do default     } } </code></pre>  <p>Many thanks for any tips or solutions</p>
