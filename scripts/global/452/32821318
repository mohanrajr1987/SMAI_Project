<p>Hi i really need some help over here. For my course in Java I am doing some tests i have found online. Question is: What gets displayed in console. </p>  <p>And I really have some problems with understanding. </p>  <p>Here is the code:</p>  <pre><code>public static void felda(){     char[] felda = {'2',0x31,48};     for (int i = 0; i&lt; felda.length; i++){         System.out.println(" : " + felda[i]);     }     System.out.println(); } public static void feldb(){     int[] feldb = {'2',0x31,48};     for (int i = 0; i&lt; feldb.length; i++){         System.out.println(" : " + feldb[i]);     }     System.out.println(); } public static void feldc(){     int [] feldc = {'2',0x31,48};     for (int i = 0; i&lt; feldc.length; i++){         System.out.println(" : " + (char) feldc[i]);     }     System.out.println(); } </code></pre>  <p>So if I run in the Solution is:</p>  <pre><code>: 2 : 1 : 0  : 50 : 49 : 48  : 2 : 1 : 0 </code></pre>  <p>So i don't understand how it is even possible to have an int definded with ' '.  And i find it very confusing how int feldb = '2' results in beeing 50 and int feldb=0x31 results in beeing 49.. dam this is all so confusing. I hope someone can enlighten me. </p>  <p>Edit: Why is char feldc = 48; resulting in beeing 0?</p>  <p>Sorry for bad english, and also sorry for bad java skills.</p>
