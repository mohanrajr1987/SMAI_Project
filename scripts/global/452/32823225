<p>As you can see I am simply trying to make the division of 2 integer variables equal a double. But, when I researched this problem I couldn't find anything and the answers that I DID find... I could not understand.</p>  <pre><code>import java.util.Scanner;  public class JRGlab02Num14 {     public static void main(String[] args)     {          int classMembers, females, males;         double pMales, pFemales;         Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);         System.out.println("Welcome to: The Male and Female Percentage Calculator.\nDesigned for taking the them number of females and males and giving you percentages from the number of total people.");         System.out.println("Please enter the number of Males:");         males = keyboard.nextInt();         System.out.println("\nThank you!\nNow, please enter the number of Females:");         females = keyboard.nextInt();         classMembers = males + females;         System.out.println("\nVery good.\nSo there are " + males + " Males.\nAnd " + females + " Females.\nGiving you a total of " + classMembers + " People.\n");         pMales = (males / classMembers) * 100;         pFemales = (females / classMembers) * 100;         System.out.println("The percentage of males are " + pMales + "%");         System.out.println("The percentage of females are " + pFemales + "%");      } } </code></pre>  <p>When I try to Print the output for pMales and pFemales... I get 0.0's I am not sure what I am doing wrong or if I had maybe missed something.  If you couldn't tell I am new to coding, so, sorry for such a lame first question.</p>
