<p>I want AutoFixture to generate two integers, and for the second one, I don't want it to be 0, or the previous generated number. Is there a way to tell AutoFixture to honor that "requirement".</p>  <p>Looking at <code>RandomNumericSequenceGenerator</code>, I looks like the <a href="https://github.com/AutoFixture/AutoFixture/blob/master/Src/AutoFixture/RandomNumericSequenceGenerator.cs#L26" rel="nofollow">lower limit is 1</a>, so I might not have to specify the first requirement. Next, I was looking at the "seeding" option, but as indicated in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/28475970/471780">this answer</a>, it won't be used for a number, by default.</p>  <p>Is there something I'm overlooking here?</p>
