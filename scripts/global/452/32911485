<p>I was performing a taks at Codility (it's content is in links below). I can't understand why it gives different results:</p>  <p>1) <a href="https://codility.com/demo/results/trainingFH5VPC-SKD/" rel="nofollow">80%</a></p>  <p>2) <a href="https://codility.com/demo/results/trainingUVM6GD-2KD/" rel="nofollow">100%</a></p>  <p>It seems like it treats the result as System.Int32 and it is System.Int64, I've checked it in VS. Is it a bug, or am I missing something?</p>
