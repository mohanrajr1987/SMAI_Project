<p>I have a problem with converting alphabet to numbers in the following case.</p>  <pre><code>string text = ""; for (X[1] = 1; X[1] &lt; 13; X[1] = X[1] + 1) {     for (X[2] = 1; X[2] &lt; 13; X[2] = X[2] + 1)     {         for (X[3] = 1; X[3] &lt; 13; X[3] = X[3] + 1)         {             if (X[3] &gt; X[2] &amp;&amp; X[2] &gt; X[1])             {                 text += "a" + "      " + X[1] + "," + X[2] + "," + X[3] + "Â¥n";             }         }     } } label1.Text = text; </code></pre>  <p>Then, I get answers something like those.</p>  <pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>a    1,2,3  a    1,2,4 a    1,2,5 a    1,2,6 </code></pre>  <p>After that, I would like to convert "a" to numbers by using counter. What I mean is that if a appears once, it is "1", twice, it is "2" and three times, it is "3" etc.</p>  <p>Thus, I would like convert the above answers in the following:</p>  <pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>1   1,2,3  2   1,2,4 3   1,2,5 4   1,2,6 </code></pre>  <p>In that case, how can I write the code. This looks very simple but I cannot come up with any solution.</p>
