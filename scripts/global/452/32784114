<p>Today i tried to make a simple program in Java that gives me the average of the numbers i entered.</p>  <p>The problem is that if i use int added (as shown below), i don't get the same answer as when i use double added.</p>  <p>Code:</p>  <pre><code>public class Main {      public static void main(String[] args) {          int amount;         int number;         int added = 0;         double average;          Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);          System.out.println("This program calculates the average of the numbers entered by you.");         System.out.println("How many numbers do you want to enter?");         amount = input.nextInt();          for(int i=1; i&lt;=amount; i++){             System.out.println("Enter a number:");             number = input.nextInt();             added = added + number;         }          average = added/amount;         System.out.println("The average of the numbers entered is: " + average);      }  } </code></pre>  <p>Result:</p>  <pre><code>This program calculates the average of the numbers entered by you. How many numbers do you want to enter? 6 Enter a number: 3 Enter a number: 2 Enter a number: 4 Enter a number: 1 Enter a number: 6 Enter a number: 5 The average of the numbers entered is: 3.0 </code></pre>  <p>When i use double, i get the right answer:</p>  <pre><code>public class Main {      public static void main(String[] args) {          int amount;         int number;         double added = 0;         double average;          Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);          System.out.println("This program calculates the average of the numbers entered by you.");         System.out.println("How many numbers do you want to enter?");         amount = input.nextInt();          for(int i=1; i&lt;=amount; i++){             System.out.println("Enter a number:");             number = input.nextInt();             added = added + number;         }          average = added/amount;         System.out.println("The average of the numbers entered is: " + average);      }  } </code></pre>  <p>Result when i use double added instead of int added:</p>  <pre><code>This program calculates the average of the numbers entered by you. How many numbers do you want to enter? 6 Enter a number: 3 Enter a number: 2 Enter a number: 4 Enter a number: 1 Enter a number: 6 Enter a number: 5 The average of the numbers entered is: 3.5 </code></pre>  <p>Why does this happen and what should i do to avoid it? To me it seems like added could be an int because i don't add up decimals but i add up whole numbers.</p>  <p>Thank you in advance.</p>
