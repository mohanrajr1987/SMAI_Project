<p>To make a long story short, I need to know how I can identify integers in a string array. For example, the following text file is opened, and each line is stored as a line in the array Movement[]....</p>  <p>right 20</p>  <p>left 25</p>  <p>up 37</p>  <p>down 42</p>  <p>left 45</p>  <p>left 65</p>  <p>... ect... </p>  <p>Is there a way that I can access one line at a time in a while loop, identify the integers, and store these integer as a variable so that I may perform operations on it?</p>  <p>Thanks very much!</p>
