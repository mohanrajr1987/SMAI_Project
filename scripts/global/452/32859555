<p>Today I came a cross this strange behaviour, could someone explain why it happens?</p>  <pre><code>var x = -1U; // When using -1UL it complains though. Console.WriteLine(x.GetType().Name); Console.WriteLine(x); </code></pre>  <p>Output:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Int64 </p>      <p>-1</p> </blockquote>  <p>MSDN says:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>If the literal is suffixed by U or u, it has the first of these types in which its value can be represented: uint, ulong.</p> </blockquote>  <p><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa664674%28v=vs.71%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa664674%28v=vs.71%29.aspx</a></p>
