<p>I am quite new to python and programming in general. For my school task i was asked to develop a basic arithmetic quiz. However when i enter a letter instead of an integer I get a ValueError. What i wanted to do was to make the code recognize a string input as a wrong answer and i am not quite sure of how to do this. I apoligise for any messy code because it is my first time posting a question. Here's my full code:</p>  <pre><code>import random import math import operator as op  def test():     #First randomly generated number     num1 = random.randint(1, 10)     #Second randomly generated number     num2 = random.randint(1, num1)                                                     #List of the signs that the program is allowed to use in order to generate the question      ops =     {                                                                               '+': op.add,         '-': op.sub,         '*': op.mul,     }      ##=&gt; ['+', '*', '-']     keys =     list(ops.keys())                                                           #e.g. '+' is chosen at random     rand_key =     random.choice(keys)                                                    #e.g. op.add     operation =     ops[rand_key]                                                          correct_result = operation(num1, num2)      #Asks the user the randomly generated question     print ("What is {} {} {}?".format(num1, rand_key, num2))                         #User inputs the answer that he/she thinks is right     user_answer= int(input("You answered: "))                                          if user_answer != correct_result:         #This is what happens when he/she gets a wrong answer         print ("Unfortunately are wrong!. The correct answer is     {}".format(correct_result))         return False      else:         #This is what happens when he/she gets a right answer         print("Well done! You got the right answer!

")                                           print("Hi {}! Welcome to the Arithmetic quiz!".format(username))  #The amount of correct questions the user starts with (default) correct_answers =     0                                                               #The amount of questions that are going to be asked num_questions =     10                                                                #Loops the process for i in     range(num_questions):                                                    if test():     correct_answers +=1   #Prints out the final score print("{}: You got {}/{} questions     correct.".format(                                                      #Along with the username     username,                                                                     #And the right number of correct answers         correct_answers,                                                               #Out of 10 (the original number of questions asked) num_questions,          ))                                                       </code></pre>
