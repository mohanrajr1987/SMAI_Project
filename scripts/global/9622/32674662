<p>How to create a chain of two tables (build two new rows through two different many to many)</p>  <pre><code>Zombies -&gt; Organs -&gt; Body_parts  Zobmies -&gt; Recovery_tools -&gt; Tools_impacts -&gt; Body_parts </code></pre>  <p>The association: </p>  <pre><code>class Zombie &lt; ActiveRecord::Base  has_many :organs  has_many :Body_parts, through: :organs  has_many :Recovery_tools, dependent: :destroy  class Organ &lt; ActiveRecord::Base  belongs_to :Zombie  belongs_to :Body_part  class BodyPart &lt; ActiveRecord::Base   has_many :zombies   belongs_to :zombies   has_many :organs   has_many :zombies, through: organs,  dependent: :destroy  class RecoveryTool &lt; ActiveRecord::Base   belongs_to :zombies   has_many :Body_parts, :through =&gt; :tools_impacts   has_many :tools_impacts, dependent: :destroy    accepts_nested_attributes_for :tools_impacts, :allow_destroy =&gt; true   class ToolsImpact &lt; ActiveRecord::Base  belongs_to :Recovery_tools  belongs_to :Body_parts </code></pre>  <p>I need if the Zombie updates\creates tools_impacts also update\create organs (with Zombie_id and body_part_id)</p>  <p>I think that am able to do it separately, like so:</p>  <pre><code> @Recovery_tools = @zombie.Recovery_tools.build(Recovery_tools_params)  if @Recovery_tools.save     @zombie.organs.build(Recovery_tools_id) </code></pre>  <p>but I would like to know if there is a way to do this at once, together. Or any other more correct way to do it. Thanks.</p>
