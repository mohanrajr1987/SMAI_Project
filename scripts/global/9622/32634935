<p>I'm trying to eager load a nested association. I've read through the <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html#eager-loading-associations" rel="nofollow">Rails Guide (13.1.2)</a> and a couple of blog posts on the subject, but I'm still struggling to grasp why the following code operates the way that it does.</p>  <p>It seems to me that <code>includes</code> should be doing exactly what I need here, but when I run my code, it doesn't seem to be doing anything at all. I've also tried <code>preload</code> and <code>eager_load</code> with identical results.</p>  <p>Models:</p>  <pre><code>class Product   has_many assets end  class Post   has_many products end </code></pre>  <p>Controller:</p>  <pre><code>@post_products = @post.products.includes(:assets) </code></pre>  <p>Console:</p>  <pre><code>@post_products.first.assets.first == nil //=&gt; true </code></pre>
