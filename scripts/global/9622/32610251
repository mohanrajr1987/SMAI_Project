<p>I'm working with CakePHP to develop a web application that has a few tables and some relationships between them. In this instance I have a series of meetings which reference a calendar year, a department and the relevant school however the model fails to grab the associated table information when data is returned from the controller to the view.</p>  <p>There is already existing <code>$belongsTo</code> relationships between staff and the department and school they belong to and I also managed to grab the associated meeting when the calendar array is returned on the calendar index but ideally I want to be able to list all the meetings with the names of calendars, departments and schools rather than the id field stored in the meetings table.</p>  <p>Here are my tables:</p>  <pre><code>dbo.meetings     id (int) *primary key*     calendar_id (int)     department_id (int)     school_id (int)     created (datetime2(7))     modified (datetime2(7))  dbo.calendar     id (int) *primary key*     name (nvarchar(50))     startdate (datetime2(7))     enddate (datetime2(7))     created (datetime2(7))     modified (datetime2(7))  dbo.schools     id (int) *primary key*     name (nvarchar(255))     (other fields)  dbo.departments     id (int) *primary key*     name (nvarchar(255))     (other fields) </code></pre>  <p>Here is the controller for Meetings:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php App::uses('AppController','Controller');  class MeetingsController extends AppController {     public $helpers = array('Form');      public function beforeFilter() {         parent::beforeFilter();     }      public function index() {         $this-&gt;set('meetings', $this-&gt;Meeting-&gt;find('all'));     } } ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Here is the model for Meeting:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php App::uses('AppModel','Model');  class Meeting extends AppModel {     public $primaryKey = 'id';     public $recursive = -1;      public $belongsTo = array(         'Calendar' =&gt; array(             'className' =&gt; 'Calendar',             'foreignKey' =&gt; 'calendar_id'         ),         'School' =&gt; array(             'className' =&gt; 'School',             'foreignKey' =&gt; 'school_id'         ),         'Department' =&gt; array(             'className' =&gt; 'Department',             'foreignKey' =&gt; 'department_id'         )     ); } ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Currently the <code>index.ctp</code> file in <code>/View/Meetings</code> just contains <code>&lt;?php echo var_dump($meetings); ?&gt;</code> which is printing out the array until I can get the association working and then I will restyle it as required.</p>  <p>Here is what the array looks like atm:</p>  <pre><code>array(1) {   [0]=&gt;   array(1) {     ["Meeting"]=&gt;     array(6) {       ["id"] =&gt; string(1) "1"       ["calendar_id"] =&gt; string(1) "1"       ["department_id"] =&gt; string(2) "33"       ["school_id"] =&gt; string(1) "1"       ["created"] =&gt; NULL       ["modified"] =&gt; NULL     }   } } </code></pre>  <p>For some reason it just won't fetch the calendar, department and school details that it should and I want it to. Can anyone help?</p>  <p>Thanks. :)</p>  <p><strong>Edit: Model for School</strong></p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php App::uses('AppModel','Model');  class School extends AppModel {      public $validate = array(         'name' =&gt; array(             'required' =&gt; array(                 'rule' =&gt; 'notBlank',                 'message' =&gt; 'A school name is required.'             )         )     ); } ?&gt; </code></pre>
