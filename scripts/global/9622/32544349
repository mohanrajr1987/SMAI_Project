<p>Lets say that i have the following associations schema:</p>  <pre><code>Person =&gt; [      hasMany =&gt; [          Courses =&gt; [Person.id = Courses.person_id]      ], Courses =&gt; [     belongTo =&gt; [          Schools =&gt; [School.id = Courses.school_id]     ] </code></pre>  <p>When I view a person through <code>mydomain/person/view/1</code> I need to have a table to show the Courses of that Person. Inside this table each Course need to show the name of the School.</p>  <p>So I tried the following on my controller:</p>  <pre><code>public function view($id = null) {     $person = $this-&gt;Persons-&gt;get($id, [         'contain' =&gt; [             'Courses.Schools',         ]     ]);     $this-&gt;set('persons', $test);     $this-&gt;set('_serialize', ['person']); } </code></pre>  <p>What I get on view is:</p>  <pre><code>Person =&gt; [     firstname =&gt; test,     lastname =&gt; test,     courses =&gt; [         0 =&gt; [             id =&gt; 1,             shool_id =&gt; 1,             person_id =&gt; 1,         ]     ] ] </code></pre>  <p>There is no school in the array although I used it in the contain option. So I can't display the name of the school. Am I doing anything wrong? Is there any guideline how can I show these fields on the view.</p>
