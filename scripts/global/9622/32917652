<p>I am trying to make an app with Rails 4.</p>  <p>I have a project model and a project invitations model.</p>  <pre><code>Projects has many project invitations Project invitations belong to projects </code></pre>  <p>In my project show, Im trying to count how many invitations have been sent and how many have been accepted.</p>  <p>The first part works fine. For the acceptances, I have an attribute in my project_invitation table called :student_accepted. If that is true, I want to count the record.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;%= @project.project_invitations.size %&gt;             &lt;% if @project.project_invitations.student_accepted == true %&gt;                 &lt;%= @project.project_invitations.size %&gt;                 &lt;% else %&gt;                 'No'             &lt;% end %&gt; </code></pre>  <p>It gives this error: </p>  <pre><code>undefined method `student_accepted' for #&lt;ActiveRecord::Associations::CollectionProxy []&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I have also tried: </p>  <pre><code>&lt;% if project.project_invitations.student_accepted == true %&gt;  &lt;%= project.project_invitations.size %&gt; </code></pre>  <p>It gives this error:</p>  <pre><code>undefined local variable or method `project' for #&lt;#&lt;Class:0x007fc01d9dcbe8&gt;:0x007fc01de04248&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Im struggling to understand how to reference attributes though associated models. I have read several books but they all assume background knowledge. I've had helpful input on related questions (below), but still not grasping the concept.</p>  <pre><code>http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32916133/rails-how-to-show-attribute-of-an-associated-model  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32898541/rails-how-to-show-attributes-from-a-parent-object </code></pre>  <p>Can anyone see what I've done wrong?</p>
