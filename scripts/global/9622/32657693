<p>I use the rails-4-automplete gem which works nicely with simple_form to autocomplete the "name" field of my model. It also updates other fields when an existing record is found except a multiple select field that is populate from a HABTM association.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;% f.association role, collection: Roles.all, prompt: "Choose a role" %&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I have set the user_params including <code>role_ids: []</code></p>  <p>Is there a way to populate this field through the association using the update_field and extra_data options of the gem?</p>
