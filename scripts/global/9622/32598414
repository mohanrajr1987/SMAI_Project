<p>I'm a new with Rails and I'm having trouble with some types of associations that seem a bit more complex than the ones I've been exposed to so far.</p>  <pre><code>Zombie_users      Body_parts_status                              Body_parts  | id | name |     | id | user_id | body_part_id | recovery |     | id | name     | |-----------| --&gt; |----------------------------------------| --&gt; |---------------| | 1  | Joe  |     | 1 |    1     |     2        |   10%    |     | 1  | left leg | | 2  | Max  |     | 2 |    1     |     3        |   43%    |     | 2  | brain    |                                                                  | 3  | hair     |                                                                  | 4  | blue eye |   Zobmie_users    Recovery_tools          Body_parts_impacts  | id | name |   | id |user_id| name |   | id|recovery_tool_id| body_part_id | impact | |-----------|--&gt;|-------------------|--&gt;|--------------------------------------------| | 1  | Joe  |   | 1  |   1   |hammer|   | 1 |       1        |      2       |   10%  | | 2  | Max  |   | 2  |   1   |magic |   | 2 |       2        |      3       |   43%  | </code></pre>  <p><a href="https://gomockingbird.com/projects/awkdgjk" rel="nofollow">graphic illustration of the needed functionality</a></p>  <p>We have <strong>users</strong> and a list of <strong>body parts</strong>. I need that the users will be able to create <strong>recovery tools</strong> with which they can through <strong>Body Parts impact</strong> recover their <strong>body parts status</strong> :) and be able to check what part of the body still need to be fixed(compared to the list) and what body parts they have already corrected.</p>  <p>My problem is that I do not know how to implement such connections. because I need to have some kind of clone of the <strong>body parts</strong> to <strong>body parts status</strong> for each user. But how I reference it so it also works with <strong>Body Parts impacts</strong> I do not have even a concept of where to start :)</p>  <p><strong>body parts</strong> table is just a long listing of all the parts of the human body and each user should have their own "copy" of all these parts.</p>
