<p>What I'm trying to do here is calculate the percentage of IDS or "users" who rated Both M1 and M2. In Other words calculate the percentage of users who rated M1 but also M2... if a box is empty on either side it doesn't count...</p>  <p>For example on Row 2 is a user who rated both M's...</p>  <p>The formula or the method I'm supposed to use is X + Y / X ... and the result is supposed to be 46.7%... but I can't get that number. Please help and thank you in advance.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/u6x0z.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/u6x0z.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
