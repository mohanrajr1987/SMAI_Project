<p>I cracked my head trying to realize how Symfony and Doctrine fetch associated entities.</p>  <p>Lets imagine: i have several associated entities:</p>  <ul> <li>Company (ManyToOne to City)</li> <li>City (ManyToOne to Region, OneToMany to Company)</li> <li>Region (ManyToOne to Country, OneToMany to City)</li> <li>Country (OneToMany to Region)</li> </ul>  <p>When i render Company form i create Form Event Listener (on PRE_SET_DATA) that inserts Region and Country selectboxes to this form. The values in these fields must be set according to associated Region.</p>  <p>I retrieve current Company Region via:</p>  <pre><code>$company = $event-&gt;getData(); $city = $company-&gt;getCity() </code></pre>  <p>That works good</p>  <p>But when i try this:</p>  <pre><code>$region = $city-&gt;getRegion(); // returns NULL $country = $region-&gt;getCountry(); // returns NULL </code></pre>  <p>these methods returns NULL. But in fact all associations exists and Doctrine association mapping is correct. <strong>Why?</strong></p>  <p>According to Doctrine documentation: when i call getter for the proxy object (these ovjects are proxies, right?) - Doctrine should fetch insufficient data from database and update the object. In fact - methods return NULLs.</p>  <p><strong>How can i get any associated entity? (from any association deep level)</strong></p>
