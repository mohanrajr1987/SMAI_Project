<p>I am using QueryBuilder to write a method in a repository. I want to make a <code>where</code> statement against an association the entity has <strong>but without needing to join on the entity</strong>. </p>  <p>Normally if I was using regular sql I would just do something like </p>  <pre><code>select * from entity where entity.assocId=5 </code></pre>  <p>But with doctrine I don’t have a field for the association's Id because it's mapped as the actual entity on that column. </p>  <p>So I think I need to do this to achieve the same thing:</p>  <pre><code>$qb-&gt;innerJoin(‘e.associatedEntity', ‘ae', Query\Expr\Join::ON); $qb-&gt;andWhere($qb-&gt;expr()-&gt;eq(‘ae.id’, $id)); </code></pre>  <p>Which implies I need to do a <code>join</code> on every entity I want to filter against, even if it's just the Id which seems <strong>way more expensive</strong> an operation than it should be.</p>  <p>So is there a way to filter by the value in the association column without needing to join the entity?</p>
