<p>I am trying to understand the model design for classified ads. Suppose I have some category and sub category under it like below</p>  <pre><code>Electronics(Main category) -Mobile --Company ---Model -TV --Company ---Model Property(Main category) -Car(Sub category) --Brand(Sub Sub category) ---Speed Range(Sub Sub Sub category) </code></pre>  <p>And I have a model for Ads.</p>  <p>How can I make the relationship among the categories, all sub categories and ads. So far I have come up with the design below</p>  <pre><code>class MainCategoy &lt; ActiveRecord::Base   has_many :subcategory end  class SubCategoy &lt; ActiveRecord::Base   has_many :subsubcategoy    belongs_to: maincategory end  class SubSubCategoy &lt; ActiveRecord::Base   has_many :subsubsubcategory   belongs_to: subcategory end  class SubSubSubCategoy &lt; ActiveRecord::Base   belongs_to: subsubcategory end  class Ads&lt; ActiveRecord::Base  end </code></pre>  <p>Now my question is (1) is my association for different category and subcategories correct? If not please suggest what would be best design.</p>  <p>(2) I don't understand how to associate ads with category and subcategory. It is not necessary that a Category will always have a SubSubSubCategory or SubSubCategory but it will must have SubCategory. How can I do the association for this? </p>
