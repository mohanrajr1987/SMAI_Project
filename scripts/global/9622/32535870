<p>In the class diagram a User can take multiple exams. An Exam is made up of several categories. Each Category has many questions. Each Question has many choices.</p>  <p>The two places I have questions about are where the User interacts with the Exam.</p>  <p>A friend of mine said I should have an association class between User and Exam called Examination. I guess, as attributes, it could have DateTime and Score. Why can't Exam store the score and have a completion date?  (Doesn't that mean that when the exam is complete it simply changes states?) With this design i guess it will have to have an attribute for User as well. This will couple User and Exam.  (If i need Examination to store the score, then will I need a CompletedCategory to store the individual scores for each Category?)</p>  <p>The other place is the relationship between User and Question. Or should it be User and Choice? I need somewhere to store the response to the questions before the score is calculated.  These responses have to be saved to the Database as well. Should Response be an association class or a list in Question? </p>  <p>Can someone explain to me the pros and cons? Is there a good resource I can read? I've read lots of StackOverflow articles. I learned a lot but still not sure which are the best designs.</p>  <p>The following article was helpful: <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/9900/Identifying-Object-Oriented-Classes" rel="nofollow">http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/9900/Identifying-Object-Oriented-Classes</a></p>  <p>But I'm still not sure why this is true: "For example, a Student class has an association to a Course class. A student can take many courses, and a course can be taken by many students. However, who is responsible for the grade? <strong>Placing the grade in the Student class gives a student the same grade for all courses. Placing the grade in the Course class gives all students taking the same course the same grade.</strong>"</p>  <p>Why can't each Exam, in my case, not simply have a User assigned to it. True that does seem to imply an Exam Session or Examination as my friend said. I can't justify it by clear explanation. Then what do i do with Category which has it own scores and Responses?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/jCVky.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/jCVky.png" alt="Association Example1"></a></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/f71gw.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/f71gw.png" alt="Association Example2"></a></p>
