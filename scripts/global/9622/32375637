<p>In my model i have this basic relationship,</p>  <p>One User has many issues.</p>  <p>One issue belongs only to one user.</p>  <p>=> On issue side: ManyToOne</p>  <p>My model:</p>  <pre><code>/**  * @var User $user  *  * @ORM\ManyToOne(targetEntity="User")  * @ORM\JoinColumn(name="userID", referencedColumnName="id")  */ private $user; </code></pre>  <p>This relation is just defined on issue side, so its unidirectional.</p>  <p>My question is:</p>  <p>Why is the column "userID" defined with:</p>  <pre><code>unique=true </code></pre>  <p>Anybody has this issue before?</p>  <p>Thanks and Greetings!</p>
