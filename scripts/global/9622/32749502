<p>I recently started working with SailsJS, and I found the process of defining attributes and associations very elegant. However, there is one thing I cannot find out:</p>  <p>I have a model Couple(person1, person2). I'd like to create an association in Person, that lists every couple they are a member of. Something along the lines of: </p>  <p><code>attributes{     //other attributes,     couples:{         collection: 'couple',         via: 'person1, person2'     } }</code></p>  <p>My current method is:</p>  <p><code>attributes{     //other attributes,     couples1:{         collection: 'couple',         via: 'person1'     },     couples2:{         collection: 'couple',         via: 'person2'     },     getCouples: function() {         return this.couples1 + this.couples2;     } }</code></p>  <p>But this doesn't seem very pretty, is there a way to do it more elegantly?</p>
