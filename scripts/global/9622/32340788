<p>I have an SPD2013 workflow on a 2010 platform.  Ever so often, I lose the association between the list and the workflow.  The workflow is not listed when viewing workflow settings for the list.  In SharePoint Designer I can see, edit, check for errors and re-publish the workflow.  After that the workflow will appear in Workflow Settings for the list. My question is why am I losing the association in the first place?</p>
