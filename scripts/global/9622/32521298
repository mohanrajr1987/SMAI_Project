<p>I'm using Atlassian Confluence which uses Lucene as searchengine.</p>  <p>I wanna associate a list of words to a specific search term.</p>  <p>Example: The user searches for "DNA", then i want lucene to look in a table if there is field for DNA...next to the DNA stands "DNS" (which is the german term). After this lookup, lucene should search for DNA OR DNS. </p>  <p>Context: Our company is international and the people from the denmark should find the content that is written in german.</p>  <p>I now that we have to set up these index by ourself. Thats okay, there are only some special words that are used, so we can handle the association.</p>
