<p>If you assemble a PE (.exe, portable executable for Win32) file it has an entry point which you could call <code>_start</code>, <code>_main</code> or whatever you like.</p>  <p>The question is - is this entry point called with some args? If so, are they accessible in the stack? If so, does this entry point function need to clear the stack? Where can I find some documentation about this?</p>
