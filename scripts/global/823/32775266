<p>In Linux kernel, the page table entry (PTE) contains R/W bits but no eXecute bit because there is no NX bit in early x86 architecture. </p>  <p>I don't understand why X bit in PTE needs hardware support. </p>  <p>As I see, we can define a bit to struct PTE as X bit in kernel source code. Kernel will check this bit in PTE when accessing page table.</p>  <p>Any explanation will be appreciated. Thanks!</p>
