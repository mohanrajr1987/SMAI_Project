<p>Running into a syntax problem when trying to declare an integer expression constant. </p>  <p>I have one constant, a <code>DWORD</code> named <code>MAX</code> with a value of <code>30</code>. I want to declare another <code>DWORD</code> named <code>MIN</code> that is 15% of 30, <code>MAX*0.15</code>, or <code>4</code>. I've tried <code>MIN DWORD MAX*0.15</code>; but that hasn't worked. </p>  <p>I need to use a <code>DWORD</code> as I have to move the value to the <code>eax</code> register. Thanks for the help!</p>
