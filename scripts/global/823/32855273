<p>I am very new to GNU assembly inlining, I have read multiple write ups but still do not fully understand what is going on. From my understanding:</p>  <p><code>movl %eax, %ebx\n\t</code> will move whatever is in <code>%eax</code> into <code>ebx</code>, but will not add the contents to each other</p>  <p><code>addl %eax, %ebx\n\t</code> will add the contents of <code>%eax</code> with <code>ebx</code> and keep it at the right most register</p>  <p><code>addl %1, %0\n\t</code> this is where i get confused, we are adding 1 and 0? why do we need to have the <code>%0</code> there?</p>
