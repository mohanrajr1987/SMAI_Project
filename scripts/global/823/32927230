<p>I want to know how to copy one string to another string in masm, I've tried multiple ways that I've found online that didn't seem to work, I can't figure it out myself as I'm rather new to this assembly language.  So, I've got a string/byte array in .data which I am modifying in another function, and I'm wondering how I can restore the string to how it was originally, after modifying it.</p>  <p>How I'm declaring my strings:</p>  <pre><code>.data menu_text db "Option 1, Option 2, Option 3", 0 og_menu_text db "Option 1, Option 2, Option 3", 0 </code></pre>  <p>One of the things that I've tried:</p>  <pre><code>cld mov esi, offset og_menu_text mov edi, offset menu_text mov ecx, lengthof og_menu_text rep movsb </code></pre>
