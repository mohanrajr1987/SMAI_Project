<p>The Intel Memory Model guarantees:</p>  <ul> <li>Stores will not be re-ordered with other Stores</li> <li>Loads will not be re-ordered with other Loads</li> </ul>  <p><a href="http://bartoszmilewski.com/2008/11/05/who-ordered-memory-fences-on-an-x86/">http://bartoszmilewski.com/2008/11/05/who-ordered-memory-fences-on-an-x86/</a></p>  <p>I have seen claims that SFENCE is redundant on x86-64 due to the Intel memory model, but never LFENCE. Do the above memory model rules make either instructions redundant?</p>
