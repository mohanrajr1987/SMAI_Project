<p>I am trying to allocate some memory using sys_brk in NASM/x86 assembly. sys_break returns the new address of break, which is the end of the data segment right? So where does my newly allocated memory reside? I assumed that it is in between the old break value and the new break value. So if I allocate 64bytes of memory with sys_brk i can use the next 64 bytes starting from the old break value that i stored before calling sys_brk. Am I right?</p>  <p>My Assembly code that will allocate memory will look somewhat like this.<a href="https://gist.github.com/nikAizuddin/f4132721126257ec4345" rel="nofollow">https://gist.github.com/nikAizuddin/f4132721126257ec4345</a></p>  <p>And another side question is; </p>  <p>I am supposed to write a function in Assembly that returns the pointer to the dynamically allocated memory and that function will be called from a C program. How can i free this block of memory from C side of my program? Would just calling free() be enough?</p>
