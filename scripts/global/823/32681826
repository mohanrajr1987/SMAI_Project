<p>If a Core writes but the cache line is not present in its L1, so it writes to the Store Buffer. Another Core requests that cache line, MESI cannot see the Store Buffer update and returns the unmodified cache line. The Store Buffer is flushed shortly after, but the second Core already uses the older value.</p>  <p>I don't see how an <code>SFENCE</code> solves this problem? Yes the cache line will be updated sooner, but the Core still needs to wait to write the value to L1 and during this time the second Core can request to read?</p>
