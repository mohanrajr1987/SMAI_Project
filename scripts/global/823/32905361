<p>I have this program that I need to make that should compute someone's age by supplying the current year and the birth year of the person. I have tried various methods but failed. What should the program/algorithm be? </p>  <p>Thank you!</p>  <p>here's what i tried:</p>  <pre><code>    mov word ax, [ANSCURRYEAR]     mov word bx, [ANSBIRTHYEAR]      SUB ax, bx       mov word [AGE], ax       lea dx, [AGE+2]  ; Print: AGE     mov ah, 09h     int 21h </code></pre>  <p>The output is some funny (probably ascii)characters</p>
