<p>Basic question:</p>  <p>I wrote the following block of code:</p>  <pre><code>DATASEG  Result db ? Modulo db ?  var3 db -9 var4 db 2   CODESEG  start:      mov ah, 0     mov al, [var3]     mov bl, [var4]     div bl     mov [Result], al     mov [Modulo], ah  </code></pre>  <p>I get wrong result for -9/2.  The result I get is "7B", seems that it treats "F7" as 247.</p>  <p>How can I get this done correctly while still defining var3 as a databyte (db)?</p>  <p>Or, is there any other way?</p>  <p>Thanks for answers</p>
