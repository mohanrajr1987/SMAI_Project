<p>I get that the x86 <code>call</code> instruction is basically:</p>  <pre><code>push return_address jmp function </code></pre>  <p>This is purely out of curiosity:</p>  <p>Let's say for whatever reason I wanted to call a function without using the <code>call</code> instruction and instead manually wanted to push the return address onto the stack and jump to the function's entry point, how would I know beforehand what my return address is so that I can push it onto the stack?  I can't directly access the <code>EIP</code> register, obviously.</p>
