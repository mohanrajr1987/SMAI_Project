<p>APM shutdown has been covered at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21463908/x86-instructions-to-power-off-computer-in-real-mode">X86 instructions to power off computer in real mode?</a></p>  <p>How to reboot instead of shutting down the computer? Please quote and explain the relevant documentation / standard in your answer.</p>  <p>I've understood that APM and ACPI are the two main methods, and I'm interested in both. Let me know if there are others.</p>  <p>I have found the ACPI spec is at <a href="http://uefi.org/specifications" rel="nofollow">http://uefi.org/specifications</a> but it's taking too much brainpower to parse it that I found it worthy of a question.</p>  <p>I could not find the URL for the APM spec, only a Google cache of a Microsoft RTF <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CB0QFjAAahUKEwjo77yCkIbIAhVCfxoKHaELBU4&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fdownload.microsoft.com%2Fdownload%2F1%2F6%2F1%2F161ba512-40e2-4cc9-843a-923143f3456c%2FAPMV12.rtf&amp;usg=AFQjCNHoCx8gHv-w08Dn_Aoy6Q3K3DLWRg&amp;sig2=a0yymq6DjHzDZDwid3E-iA" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>  <p>If you need a way to test your answer, <a href="https://github.com/cirosantilli/x86-bare-metal-examples/blob/01a5e64efaac653429ee24e502f611fea7850abb/apm_shutdown.S" rel="nofollow">this minimal APM shutdown boot sector example</a> may be a good starting point. The goal is to convert it to a reboot example instead.</p>  <p>I have read the Linux kernel 4.2 code at <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v4.2/arch/x86/realmode/rm/reboot.S#L114" rel="nofollow">arch/x86/realmode/rm/reboot.S</a> but I don't understand how it works, since I can't find the difference between those commands and my working shutdown example.</p>  <p>Related more generic on superuser: <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/294681/how-does-a-computer-restart-itself">http://superuser.com/questions/294681/how-does-a-computer-restart-itself</a></p>  <p>Related question for protected mode: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30633489/rebooting-in-protected-mode/30696648#30696648">Rebooting in Protected Mode</a></p>
