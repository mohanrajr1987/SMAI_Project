<p>UserPrincipal seems to be Microsoft's preferred method of accessing information for a user in active directory, and Microsoft does supply tools to find the a UserPrincipal  by a primary email address, but if you also want to check the secondary email address (found in "proxyAddresses") there seems to be no method other than accessing the UserPrincipal for each user and checking it.</p>  <p>The active directory's DirectorySearcher  allow one to build a query to directly check for a match in the "proxyAddresses". Those call return a SearchResult and I cannot find a method of converting a SearchResult to a UserPrincipal.</p>  <p>Is there any way find the UserPrincipal for user given any primary or secondary email address and get a UserPrincipal as a result?</p>
