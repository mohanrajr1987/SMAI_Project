<p>I've decent experience in sharepoint OOTB features, but I'm totally new to Custom things like CSOM, JAVAScript etc.,</p>  <p>I've recently received task to create a webpart to display treeview of AD users in sharepoint 2013.</p>  <p>The requirements are: TreeView should organized through designation of AD users. If we click on any user, I will get the details of that user like Name, Dept, Email, Phone etc.,</p>  <p>When I googled I found similar custom webpart in CodePlex named "<a href="https://usersadbrowser.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">USERADBROWSER</a>"</p>  <p>on which, the treeview is organized based on Departments. I need AD users treeview &amp; it should organized by users designations.. Pls Help!!</p>  <p>Thanks in advance..</p>  <p>Regards, Arun</p>
