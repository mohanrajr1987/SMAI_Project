<p>Is there anyway to connect to a server that uses CAM authentication in VBA using the TM1 API? </p>  <p>I've tried the following code based on the answer found here:<br> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21336817">Error when connecting to server</a></p>  <pre class="lang-vb prettyprint-override"><code>Dim credentials(1 To 3) As Long credentials(1) = TM1ValString(hPool, Trim(CAMNamespace), 0) credentials(2) = TM1ValString(hPool, Trim(ClientName), 0) credentials(3) = TM1ValString(hPool, Trim(ClientPassword), 0) vCredentials = TM1ValArray(hPool, credentials, 3) hServer = TM1SystemServerConnectWithCAMNamespace(hPool, vServerName, vCredentials) </code></pre>  <p>However, this causes Excel to crash.</p>  <p>I know I'm connecting to the correct server and I know the usernames / passwords are correct, I know that the TM1 API is installed correctly on my computer as well.</p>
