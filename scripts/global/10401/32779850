<p>I would like to determine if the organization I work for requires a centralized, decentralized or hybrid administration structure. How do I do that? Is it a general valid recommendation say if the organization has 100, 1000 or 10 000 employees? What exactly means centralized / decentralized administration structure from Active Directory perspective? Highly appreciate if you would direct me to some links or resources, but a few brief explanation would be also highly appreciated ...</p>
