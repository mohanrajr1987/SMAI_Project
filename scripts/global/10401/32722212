<p>I have an application where I use SASL(Kerberos) to bind to ldap. In this case ldap_search_s function returns operation error when I use root as a base dn. In example if base_dn="DC=AD" and filter is (cn=administrator) ldap_search_s returns 1. ldap_search_s works as expected when I use the same filter with base_dn = "OU=OMD,DC=AD"(it works also with any other sub entry in the tree used as a base dn). I don't see the same issue when I use ldap_simple_bind_s function to bind to the server. Could you please help me understand what do I do wrong here ?</p>
