<p>I have a scenario where user's of a Windows .net client app want to use Active Directory based SSO against a cloud service that the .net client calls. The .net client should use the local user's credentials without requiring a sign-in form. The cloud service is not in a trusted domain.</p>  <p>Can this be achieved?  Is there a method to use OAuth2 or OpenID Connect with the user's AD?</p>
