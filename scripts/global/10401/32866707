<p>I am attempting to use LDIFDE to export users, groups, and OUs for importing into a different domain.  I'm at the stage where I'm importing users, and I've noticed a problem.</p>  <p>I utilized this command to export users from my domain controller:</p>  <pre><code>ldifde -f Exportuser.ldf -p subtree -r "(&amp;(objectCategory=person)(objectClass=User)(givenname=*))" -l "cn,givenName,objectclass,samAccountName" </code></pre>  <p>This is the bare minimum required, because if you run the command without the -l filters, you end up with data that wont import, and stops the import.</p>  <p>Anyways, I get users out perfectly fine with the script (that is, it runs), and they even import with the -i -f Exportuser.ldf command no problem.  However, while importing the group membership associations I got some errors that gave me cause to look closer at what I'd created.  To wit:  The command above skipped quite a few users in the process of export.  These range from system accounts to actual active users, though the "hardest" hit was an OU where we keep deactivated accounts.  Not a single strange flag goes up, either.</p>  <p>I can't seem to find anything special about these various users that they'd have in common, but I'm still looking.  In the mean time, I thought I'd check to see if anyone here had any history of LDIFDE simply just blowing past users.</p>  <p>Thanks,</p>  <p>M.</p>
