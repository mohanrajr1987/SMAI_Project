<p>I have 2 PCs, both have Windows Server 2003. PC1 is Primary Domain Controller and PC2 is additional domain controller. PC55 joined Active Directory Domain. PC55 was visible in Active Directory Users and Computers on PC1 (Primary Domain Controller) and PC2 (Additional Domain Controller). PC2 (Additional Domain Controller) was shutdown for 1 month. I reinstalled Windows on PC55 and delete PC55 from PC1 (Primary Domain Controller), then PC55 joined joined Active Directory Domain. I started PC2 (Additional Domain Controller) after 1 month, disconnected network cable then delete PC55 and reconnected network cable. I was thinking that Active Directory Replication would copy PC55 from PC1 (Primary Domain Controller) to PC2 (Additional Domain Controller). But instead of copying PC55 from PC1 (Primary Domain Controller) to PC2 (Additional Domain Controller), Active Directory deleted PC55 on PC1 (Primary Domain Controller). Can anyone tell me why this happened?</p>
