<p>I have a need to find all the nested groups in a particular group 1 layer down.  The problem I have is the code below usually works, but for some groups it does not.  </p>  <p>If I use Windows Explorer to search for a particular group (click on the Network icon, then click on 'Search Active Directory', I can see the members and nested groups within the parent group.  But through code using   System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement on 3.5 Framework, <code>var Groups = MyGroup.GetGroups();</code> can't see the nested groups of some groups.  I thought it was a permissions thing, but if i can see inside the group from my own manual  search mentioned above, then I assume the code running from the same account should be able to see the same thing too.  Is there something different I should try?</p>  <p>For what its worth, I'm using a script task on top of Framework 3.5 inside of a SSIS package. Also in the same package, searching for groups from a user principle object instead of a group principle works fine.  </p>  <p>And for clarity, when I run this code</p>  <pre><code>     PrincipalContext AD = new PrincipalContext(ContextType.Domain, "ctx", "mypath");      GroupPrincipal myGroup = GroupPrincipal.FindByIdentity(AD, "myparentgroup");      var nestedgroups = myGroup.GetGroups(); </code></pre>  <p>"Nestedgroups" is null when it should contain my nested groups.</p>
