<p>I currently use a script to display all computers assigned to a security group. The script I currently use is a VB Script:</p>  <pre><code>Set objGroup = GetObject("LDAP://cn=My Group,ou=Security Groups,ou=_Groups - standard,ou=city,ou=state,dc=my,dc=domain,dc=tld,") For Each objMember in objGroup.Members Wscript.Echo objMember.Name  Next </code></pre>  <p>This script works and pulls every member of My Group from the entire domain. This works, but I'm trying to filter it a bit. I want to search computers through a specific OU. I have tried the following code to no avail:</p>  <pre><code>Dim objGroup Dim objMachine Dim objMatch  Set objGroup = GetObject("LDAP://cn=My Group,ou=Security Groups,ou=_Groups - standard,ou=city,ou=state,dc=my,dc=domain,dc=tld") Set objMachine = GetObject("LDAP://ou=Building,ou=street,ou=city,ou=state,dc=my,dc=domain,dc=tld")  Dim c For each c in objGroup if c = objMachine Then Wscript.Echo objMachine.Name end if next </code></pre>  <p>The code executes without error, but I do not see any output. I then decided to tackle this problem in PowerShell.</p>  <pre><code>$computer = Get-ADGroup -searchbase 'ou=Building,ou=street,ou=city,ou=state,dc=my,dc=domain,dc=tld' -Filter * ` | Get-ADGroup -Filter {(Name -eq "My Group") -or (Name -eq "My Other Group")} ` | Select-Object -Unique ` | Sort-Object DistinguishedName;  $computer | Select-Object Name, DistinguishedName;  export-csv C:\Temp\Result.csv </code></pre>  <p>This throws a few errors in ISE stating that the cmdlet Get-ADGroup doesn't support pipeline input or the input didn't match. At the end, it lists the two groups, as well as their distinguished names.</p>  <p>I would like to get a computer name as well as the Distinguished Name for every computer that is a member of either "My Group" or "My Other Group" in the Building OU as well as each OU under that OU. I would prefer a way to do it in PowerShell, but I can use VB Script as well.</p>  <p>(Sorry if I'm missing any critical information, this is my first posting.)</p>
