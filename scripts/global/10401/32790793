<p>I am working on Active directory for the first time. I have managed to get my user's information from LDAP active directory. Also I could retrieve all groups of my active directory.</p>  <p>But the groups that I retrieved from AD, don't appear in Microsoft outlook groups.</p>  <p>Also I could get users for a specific group from active directory's retrieved list of groups. And that user was part of the microsoft outlook.</p>  <p><strong>Does Active directory and microsoft outlook use different databases?</strong></p>  <p>Query to fetch groups is as below, and few of those that I checked did not appear in my outlook,</p>  <pre><code>ldapTemplate.search(query().where("objectClass").is("group") </code></pre>  <p>Below is the query to fetch users of 'some-ABC Group' that my client told is part of Active direcotry, but the below query did not fetch results, also the  "some-ABC Group" is not available through outlook.</p>  <pre><code>List&lt;User&gt; users = ldapTemplate.search(query().where("objectCategory")         .is("user").and("memberof").is("CN=some-ABC Group,OU=Users,DC=XX,DC=XX,dc=xx,dc=xxx")         , new ContextMapper()); </code></pre>  <p>Please suggest.</p>
