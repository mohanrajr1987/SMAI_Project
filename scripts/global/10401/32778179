<p>I have the following scenario:</p>  <p>We have own token service interface which we would like to use with Azure Active Directory. </p>  <p>I use "<a href="https://login.microsoftonline.com/[clientId]/oauth2/authorize" rel="nofollow">https://login.microsoftonline.com/[clientId]/oauth2/authorize</a>" endPoint</p>  <p>and trying to authorize user using basic authentication and post request.</p>  <p>Is something wrong in this scenario?</p>
