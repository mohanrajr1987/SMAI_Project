<p>I am administering an office that utilizes Office 365 instead of the traditional Microsoft Office suite. While I have Azure ADSync set to run every hour, our Office 365 passwords haven't quite synced with our Active Directory passwords.</p>  <p>Case in point, we have two users who recently got prompted by Outlook to put in their passwords but had to put in their previous Active Directory passwords to advance. </p>  <p>If ADSync is running every hour, why did users still have to use old passwords to use Office 365? I'll be consulting Microsoft on this issue as well.</p>
