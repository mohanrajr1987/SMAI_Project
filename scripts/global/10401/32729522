<p>I have an Azure web API application which is secured by an azure active directory tenant.  Through Postman I am trying to obtain the OAuth2 access token <strong><em>using Postman's OAuth2 Helper</em></strong>.  The get access-token requires four bits of info: The tenant auth endpoint, the tenant token endpoint, the client id  and the client secret of the associated tenant application.   It also seems that the tenant application reply url must include <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/oauth2/callback" rel="nofollow">https://www.getpostman.com/oauth2/callback</a> which is where postman is supposed to retrieve the token into the helper. </p>  <p>I can't get this to work.  The get access token button reports back an error but it is very hard to decipher what the error is: the debug url reveals nothing really.</p>  <p>Has anyone had any experience attempting to get an AAD Oauth access token with postman's OAuth2 helper?  If so, do you have any hints as to where I should look to debug what is going on? </p>
