<p>I am not very familiar with networking and hence apologise if this looks a trivial query.</p>  <p>I am having few EC2 machines that have been created on AWS. One of them is a Windows 2012 R2 machine on which Active Directory is being setup. And the rest are CentOS machines. All the CentOS machines are part of a Hadoop cluster.</p>  <p>The query I am having is with the domain name for these Ec2 machines. Assume our requirement is to have the domain name /realm for the Windows machine as AD.com and the domain name  /realm for all the other Linux machines as HADOOP.com</p>  <p>How to setup such a mechanism and enable these two domains to talk? We would want to use Kerberos authentication as thats the authentication model Hadoop supports at the moment.</p>  <p>Any ideas please?</p>  <p>Thanks Vijay</p>
