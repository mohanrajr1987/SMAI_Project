<p>Is there a way to connect to SQL Server using the domain account from Linux box with Python? Like windows authentication or trusted connection or integrated security when we connect from a windows box is there a similar way to be able to connect from Linux box using pymssql? I don't want to provide a username and password for my connection and want to use the domain account of the user trying to connect to SQL server.</p>  <p>If so, what is the connection string?</p>
