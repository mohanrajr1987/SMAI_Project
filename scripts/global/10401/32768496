<p>Typically I use the "set-aduser -replace" option for updating attributes in Active Directory, but I am finding that some attributes require a different syntax to modify them and I was just wondering why.  A good example of this are the two attributes below, Office and physicalDeliveryName, same cmdlet to modify, but different syntax.  Are all attributes not created equally?</p>  <pre><code>$users = gc -Path C:\0NIX\03SCRIPTS\TMP\jkirb\allen.txt              foreach ($user in $users) {                 Get-ADUser -Identity $user -Properties * | Select samaccountname, Office, physicalDeliveryOfficeName                 Set-ADuser $user -Office "Allen"     Set-ADuser $user -replace @{physicalDeliveryOfficeName="Allen"} } </code></pre>
