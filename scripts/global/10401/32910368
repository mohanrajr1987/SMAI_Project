<p>I am writing an iOS app and using Azure Mobile Services for my identity management and DocumentDB for noSQL DB. However the only access control that I can see for DocumentDB is when we use Active Directory (which I am not currently using.)</p>  <p>I see from  <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/fundamentals-identity/" rel="nofollow">https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/fundamentals-identity/</a> that there is a way of integrating  access control service without using the active directory authentication.  However I can't find any documentation showing how this can be done. Has anyone done this?  I am on a mac and developing for iOS. The only documentation I see is for .NET and a ASP.NET MVC application: <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-dotnet-how-to-use-access-control/" rel="nofollow">https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-dotnet-how-to-use-access-control/</a></p>  <p>Also, does anyone know if Active Directory can be integrated with a JavaScript backend? All the docs show using Active Directory with a .NET backend.</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
