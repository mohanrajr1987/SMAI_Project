<p>We are using our TokenHandler to generate tokens</p>  <p>Our urls look like this <a href="http://abc.go.com?token=1234" rel="nofollow">http://abc.go.com?token=1234</a>.</p>  <p>Now we would like to use Azure AD to generate tokens, it it possible to make server side token validation without creating special http request headers, so that we just use current interface for tokens, but tokens are comming from azure ad?</p>
