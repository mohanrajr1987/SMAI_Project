<p>Probably an amateur question, but I have taken over consulting for an application a previous consulting used to do. </p>  <p>His ASP.NET connection strings appear to work in a way I have never seen before. The connection string points to a server, username, password as usual yet when I look for the SQL Server account to the DB it doesn't exist nor does it appear in a UDL test file and the only account that exists in the database is a windows account.</p>  <p>Is there some sort of aliasing happening, and if so, where and how would I find it?</p>  <p>If a duplicate the database for testing using the same credentials but different db name, it fails. </p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
