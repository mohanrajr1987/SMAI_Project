<p>I have a background in AD infrastructure and powershell. However, I don't have much background on C# and .NET  I'm thinking of putting aside some time to learn the how to write useful applications using C#/visual studio using .NET on Active Directory. Is there is a good book (preferably PDF/ebook) which I can read? Preferably if the books covers how to get some common tasks in AD groups:</p>  <ol> <li>List item</li> <li>detecting circular nested groupings</li> <li>writing reports on groups</li> <li>creating forms to create applications for help desk level support people</li> <li>Where and what classes are available in .net and pros and cons of each</li> <li>some basics of how to use hash tables, lists, dynamic arrays, working with xml</li> <li>get various reports on user based on password expiry, account expiry etc.</li> </ol>
