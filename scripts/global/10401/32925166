<p>This may be too broad, but I'm a bit lost and hope you can help me.</p>  <p>In general: I have to decide whether I use LDAP or Microsoft Active Directory as an identity provider (in OpenShift).</p>  <p>In particular: I <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/663402/what-are-the-differences-between-ldap-and-active-directory">know</a> that AD uses LDAP and I know how about those two concepts work. </p>  <p>BUT: Which one is easier to setup and to maintain? Which one provides "more" or "better" security? There is already a working company-wide AD but this (introducing OpenShift) is a pilot project and we have a little time and litte money. ;)</p>  <p>Really looking forward to any answers.</p>
