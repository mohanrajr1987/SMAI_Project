<p>For a WordPress multisite installation i'm trying to set up SAML into Active Directory. </p>  <p>I have a metadata file, that's being loaded from ADFS. </p>  <p>Is it possible to add multiple "claims" or "whitelisted domains" to this metadata file so i can access it from other domains as well?</p>  <p>My main domain is:  <a href="http://testing.com" rel="nofollow">http://testing.com</a></p>  <p>I'd like <a href="http://subdomain1.testing.com" rel="nofollow">http://subdomain1.testing.com</a> and <a href="http://subdomain2.testing.com" rel="nofollow">http://subdomain2.testing.com</a> to work as well.</p>  <p>And if it's possible, does anyone have a good reference for this?</p>
