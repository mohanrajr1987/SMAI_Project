<p>I'm trying to retrieve an old mailbox in the hopes of getting a mail that is important. I use SBS 2010 with a MS exchange server 2010 installation. I've concluded that it is deleted permanently because of the limits in the 'Mailbox database properties(30 days)'.</p>  <p>I need help in finding a way of retrieving this. I found out that on the client computers there might be an old *.pst file in which the email is located. I'm hoping that the Active Directory keeps a log on the client computers logins, so I can manually check each of them if the have this file. I looked for a solution or possibility but with no success.</p>  <p>Another way maybe, would be to create a new mailbox database and put an older backup in this one.</p>  <p>An answer would be great but pointing me in the right direction aswel.</p>
