<p>I need to get a companies 365 users migrated over into server 2012 essentials as users. Wondering if this is just a simple tool that is built into either of the systems. I have looked other places and it is easy to do say from AD to 365, or even from essentials (not using the classic AD system) to 365. I would like to avoid using AD azure sink first and then migrating them back to essentials via poweshell if I can (would rather then never hit AD). Thank you in advance. </p>
