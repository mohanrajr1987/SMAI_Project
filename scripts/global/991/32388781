<p>I'm sorry I couldn't figure out a better way to phrase my question. But hopefully this example makes more sense: I have a function that I'm writing, and in a part of it, I get results such as '(13). My question is, can I turn that into '(1 3)? I hope this is the right place to ask this since I haven't posted any code.</p>
