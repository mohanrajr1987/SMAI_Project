<p>I'm trying to write a program in Scheme to compute the result of the power function using the fast power algorithm/recursion. The algorithm should be correct, but somewhere my syntax is off. The program compiles, but when I input a base and exp to test, Dr. Racket freezes up and runs out of memory. Having a difficult time locating online examples for how the (even?) function should appear in scheme code. I think this might be throwing my syntax off. New to scheme so any help would be much appreciated. </p>  <pre><code>(define (powFun base exp)     (if ( = exp 0)                       //base case      1                                             (even? exp                        //if exp is even           (*             (powFun base ( / exp 2))             (powFun base ( / exp 2))           )         (*           (powFun base (- exp 1) )      // else if exp is odd            base         )      )   ) </code></pre>  <p>)</p>
