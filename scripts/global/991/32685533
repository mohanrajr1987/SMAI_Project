<pre><code>(define (pair a b)     (lambda (f) (f a b)))  (define (fst x) .... ) </code></pre>  <p>'fst' is supposed to return a when i call (fst(pair 1 2))</p>  <p>I know that function (f a b) is stored in 'x' when i call (fst(pair 1 2)) How can I extract 'a' out? Any tips? </p>  <p>I tried using (car x) and (cdr x), but x is clearly not a list.</p>  <p>Edit: I ended up with this:</p>  <pre><code>(define (fst x) (x (lambda (p q) p))) (define (snd x) (x (lambda (p q) q))) </code></pre>  <p>I am really new to scheme programming so i am still trying to understand how the compiler works. So, from this i learnt that if the "lambda" keyword is used after a function. so like (x (lambda (p q)), this actually extracts the p and q from x. Am i correct?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
