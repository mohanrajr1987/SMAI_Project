<p>I can't find out how to do trigonometry in Scheme. As far as I know, there have been <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=trigonometry+%5Bscheme%5D">no questions</a> asked on SO about this! What are the names of the functions, and what units do they use?</p>  <p>EDIT:  Just remembered I'd found a lisp function list <a href="http://community.schemewiki.org/?lispme-language-elements" rel="nofollow">here</a>, but it has no units.</p>
