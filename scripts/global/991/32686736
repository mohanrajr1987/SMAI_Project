<p>So my task is to implement the most basic version of the 'map' function and the 'filter' functions in Scheme using fold-left or fold-right. I am having a really hard time understanding what exactly these functions are doing. Here is what I have:</p>  <pre><code>(define (myMap f l)     (fold-left (lamda (f a) (f a)) '() l))  (define (myFilter f l)     (fold-left f '() l)) </code></pre>  <p>The bottom one is what I intuitively thought it should be. Apply a filter (say number? to every element of l and put the result in the null list). The top is just completely wrong but I feel like that is more on the right track. Using some kind of lambda function to apply the function to a number?</p>  <p>Here is an example of the output I am looking for:</p>  <pre><code>(myMap sqrt '(4 9 16 25)) ; (2 3 4 5) (myFilter odd? '(1 2 3 4 5)) ; (1 3 5) </code></pre>
