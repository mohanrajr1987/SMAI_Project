<p>I am using Sublime Text 2 and Petite Chez Scheme interpreter. I have the REPL up in Sublime and I can run line commands on it successfully, but when i create a .ss file above it and attempt to transfer the file (tools->SublimeREPL->Transfer to File->File) I get an error message saying "cannot find REPL for 'scheme'". </p>  <p>I have found other questions with the same error message but the only issue was that they did not have the REPL open or they were using MIT-Scheme (in which the solution did not fix my problem)</p>  <p>The bin path for Petite is in my env. var. path</p>  <p>Does anyone have any idea what is the issue and how I might be able to get this to work? Thank you!</p>  <p>OS: Windows 7 64-bit Sublime Text 2 Version 2.0.2 Petite Chez Scheme Version 8.4</p>
