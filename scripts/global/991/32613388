<p>I'm working on Racket in Scheme for a class and the problem is to create a recursive function that displays the sum of n odd numbers starting from 1. The program just keeps running and running and I can't understand why. Any help would be appreciated.<br> (ie if I call (odd-sum 2) I want it to evaluate 1 + 3 (first two odd numbers) and display 4) </p>  <pre><code>(define (odd-sum n)  (odd-sum-work (- (* 2 n) 1))) (define (odd-sum-work n)  (if (= n 1)       1)      (+ n (odd-sum-work (- n 2)))) </code></pre>
