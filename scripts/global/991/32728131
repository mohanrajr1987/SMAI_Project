<p>Lets say I want to do the following: </p>  <pre><code>(define (foo lst x)    (filter function lst) </code></pre>  <p>but <code>function</code> takes in 2 arguments (and <code>function</code> was given to me), one being the list <code>lst</code> it will use, and the other being <code>x</code>. Syntactically, how would I change that line to pass in the second argument? Sorry I am new to Scheme/DrRacket.</p>
