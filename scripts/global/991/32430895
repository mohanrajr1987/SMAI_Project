<p>I would like to define an unbind-var function that unbinds the closest binding of a variable. </p>  <p>For example </p>  <pre><code>({let {[x 2]}   {let {[x 3]}      {let {[z 3]}       {+ x {unbind-var x {+ x z}}}}}}) </code></pre>  <p>would return 3+2+3=8 (it uses the first value of x in the unbind-var form). There can be arbitrary nestings. </p>  <p>It seems the only strategy is walk back from the unbind-var x until we find the second let for x. I.e. somehow I have to convert the entire expression into a list and then pick pieces with car/first and cdr/rest?</p>
