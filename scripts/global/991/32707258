<p>I just starting learning functional programming and need help with something that I would think is really easy, but can't figure out (been a long day).</p>  <p>Basically I have multiple lists (each with ints) within a bigger list. I want to add an element to each list. What I have so far, but can't finish off...</p>  <pre><code>(define (number-adder lstInlst x)      (map append x somehow??? lstInlst)) </code></pre>  <p>Any help is appreciated!</p>
