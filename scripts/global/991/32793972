<p>I'm trying to make a switch statement macro in Racket. I'm having some trouble figuring out excatly how to do it. I would like to be able to use the function as shown below.</p>  <pre><code>(define x 99)  (switch x     [3 (displayln "x is 3")]     [4 (displayln "x is 4")]     [5 (displayln "x is 5")]     ['default (displayln "none of the above")]) </code></pre>  <p>I've tried using pattern matching with syntax-case but i'm not sure that is the correct approach. Any Racket experts here that could give me a push in the right direction?</p>
