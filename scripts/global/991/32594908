<p>I am working with ANSYS Fluent solver having built-in Scheme interpreter in TUI alowing scheme journals to be sourced for batch runs. Unfortunately the interpreter is not documented by the vendor being assumed to be internal part, though users worldvide use the built in interpreter to automate some tasks, like reporting of results for example.</p>  <p>Is there a way how to get more knowledge about the interpreter by using some standard scheme inqueries? To acquire the scheme version or standard it is using or list of functions available for using?</p>  <p>Generally, what could user do having known nothing about the interpreter, to get information to start with?</p>
