<p>I'm building fairly simple portrait application with vertical scrolling, and using currently <a href="https://github.com/freshplanet/Air-Mobile-ScrollController" rel="nofollow">Air-Mobile-Scrollcontroller</a> for scrolling.</p>  <p>I basicly create empty movieclip <code>content</code>, add all my graphics into it and trying to use my background image (also inside <code>content</code>) as size for the scrollable area.</p>  <pre><code>bg.width = content.width = stage.stageWidth; bg.scaleY = bg.scaleX; content.height = bg.height; content.addChild(bg); </code></pre>  <p>So at this point I know that my bg is scaled correctly and it should define limits for my scrollable area. Here's the code for ScrollContainer:</p>  <pre><code>var container:RectangleSprite = new RectangleSprite(0xFFFFFF, 0, 0, stage.stageWidth, bg.height); addChild(container); container.addChild(content); var containerViewport:Rectangle = new Rectangle(0, 0, stage.stageWidth, stage.stageHeight); scroll = new ScrollController(); scroll.horizontalScrollingEnabled = false; scroll.addScrollControll(content, container, containerViewport); </code></pre>  <p>And obviously with debug player it works fine as my document size is correct (640x960), but with mobile device (Note4) the height of <code>content</code> seems to be too high, just like scaleY would be more than scaleX. If I disable the line with <code>addScrollControl</code>, everything looks correct.</p>  <p>This really must be something simple that I just don't see now. I've tried to trace all possible values but can't seem to see where I go wrong way.</p>  <p>Thanks,   Kaarto</p>
