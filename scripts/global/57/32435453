<p>As part of a recent project, I've build a Desktop AIR application - a toolkit of sorts that makes various File calls, loads numerous BorderContainer objects to propulate the UI.</p>  <p>When running in the Debugger, the application runs very smoothly. No CPU hikes, fairly steady memory consumption - overall nice performance.</p>  <p>However, when I build it as a proper release, install it, and run it - the CPU utilisation skyrockets, using 13% of my CPU at all times (running a pretty beefy i7, so this is a concerning amount for a simple toolkit).</p>  <p>I've run the Profiler, same performance spikes.</p>  <p>Is there any reason my application would have so much higher utilisation when running as an app - than in the debugger?</p>  <p>Can provide more info as needed to help - Thanks in advanced.</p>
