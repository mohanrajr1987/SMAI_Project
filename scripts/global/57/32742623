<p>So, I'm building fairly simple application for portrait mode only, and it will have vertical scrolling for content.</p>  <p>Content is basicly a MovieClip containing image as background and other minor elements (couple small MovieClips as buttons etc).</p>  <p>The problem is that I don't seem to find a smooth way to scroll my content. I would love it to be smooth and accurate, and I've tried numerous different ways for it.</p>  <p>For testing purposes the background I'm using (inside my <code>content</code> MovieClip) is 533x1250 jpg from library.</p>  <p>This is how I add my <code>content</code> mc and backround into it:</p>  <pre><code>scaleXFactor = stage.stageWidth / 640; //my stage is 640x960 ... addChild(content); //which is new MovieClip() var bg:bg1 = new bg1(); bg.x = p1bg.y = 0; bg.width = 640 * scaleXFactor;  bg.scaleY = bg.scaleX; content.width = bg.width; content.height = bg.height; content.addChild(bg); </code></pre>  <p>For scrolling I assumed I'd be safe by just simply using MOUSE_DOWN &amp; MOUSE_UP event listeners and basic ENTER_FRAME function like this:</p>  <pre><code>mouseLastPos = stage.mouseY; if(MouseUpVar == 1){                                                             mousePosDiff = (mouseOriPosY-mouseLastPos);          }                                                         content.y -= mousePosDiff*1.2; mouseOriPosY = stage.mouseY;                              if(MouseUpVar == 0){ //Smoothening which is allowed by MOUSE_UP     if(mousePosDiff &gt; 0){         mousePosDiff -= 0.001;     }else if(mousePosDiff &lt; 0){         mousePosDiff += 0.001;     } } if(content.y &lt; (content.height - stage.stageHeight)*-1){                     content.y = (content.height - stage.stageHeight)*-1; }else if(content.y &gt; 0){     content.y = 0; } </code></pre>  <p>In debug player it's as smooth as you can ever imagine, but in real device (Samsung Note4) it's very laggy and clumsy.</p>  <p>I've also tried freshplanet's script, which is not as laggy, but still a little clumsy, and messes up my scaleY for some reason.   And IScrollerComponent seems to have some issues on AIR, and I didn't get any visual elements on my screen with it. Rendering settings or cacheAsBitmap didn't seem to have any effect on this.</p>  <p>How should this be done right? Is it normal that this 'small' image (533x1250) causes bad lag?  I really need to use AS3 and AIR for this, so I'm hoping to find a good and "simple" solution (yeah, that doesn't happen too often).</p>  <p>Thanks,   kaarto</p>
