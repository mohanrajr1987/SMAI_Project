<p>I am trying to learn ActionScript 3 for the purpose of using the Air for Mobile   ( Android ) feature. I have two swf files and would like to load and run the second file from the first file. This works fine when i package both files as part of the  apk.</p>  <p>But if the second swf file is placed in user storage the file is loaded but it does not wait for user interaction.The swf plays out like a video.</p>  <p>This is what i wrote in the first file to load the second file.</p>  <pre><code>var loader:Loader=new Loader();  loader.contentLoaderInfo.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, onLoaded); loader.load(new URLRequest("file:///storage/emulated/0/swfs/second.swf"));  function onLoaded(e:Event):void {     addChild(loader); } </code></pre>  <p>I would really appreciate it if some one can point me i the right direction.</p>  <p>This the code in second.swf. Event though now i can see the button.. the click event does not work. Now i am not sure this issue is totally related to AS3.</p>  <pre><code>loader.contentLoaderInfo.addEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME, handleReady ); function handleReady( initEvent:Event ):void {     trace("Enter-Frame");     MovieClip(initEvent.currentTarget.content).stop(); }  button.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK,touchfun); function touchfun(e:MouseEvent) {     trace("btn click");     button.visible=false; }  </code></pre>
