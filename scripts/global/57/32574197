<p>I'd like to implement an offline map of my region in my AIR apps (IOS/Android). </p>  <p>I've read that OpenStreetMap was doing a really great job with offline maps. </p>  <p>I went to this site  : market.trimbledata.com and downloaded the region that I want.  I've downloaded the file in ESRI Shape, CSV and GeoJSON. </p>  <p>Now, I would like to import this map in an AS3 project (in Adobe FLASH PRO CC). Do you know how I can do that ? </p>  <p>Thank you very much,  </p>
