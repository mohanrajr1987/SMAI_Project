<p>I am working on a mobile app on <code>AIR 17.0.0.124</code>. It works smooth and great but while running on an other computer it says ~" there is no <code>AIR SDK 17..</code>. It set to closest version". And when test it says "test movie launch terminated/test movie terminated". If I switch AIR 3.2 from <code>Target</code> dropdown menu it throws the same error too. What is wrong and what could be the problem?</p>  <p>edit:</p>  <p>Is it possible to have such failure because of unsupported features/functions from version to version?</p>
