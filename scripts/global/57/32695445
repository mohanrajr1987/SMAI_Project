<p>I am trying to send wstring (which is a device name) to flash side but having a really tough time even after so many efforts. I am able to send the device name after converting it to string which is not desirable as special characters get lost during the conversion. The code used for sending string is:</p>  <pre><code>void dispatchEvent(string msgCode, string message){      const uint8_t* sbuffer = (uint8_t*) message.c_str();     string cd = msgCode;     const uint8_t* code = (uint8_t*) cd.c_str();     if(eventContext != NULL){     FREDispatchStatusEventAsync(eventContext, code, sbuffer);     } } </code></pre>  <p>but this fails when device name is say माइक्रोफोन or any name having special characters (I am on an english system and working on a windows desktop app).  <br> Please help me with something like <code>void dispatchEventW(wstring msgCode, TCHAR *message)</code></p>
