<p>I'm building a mixed interaction AS3/AIR application. Some of my scenes use the regular CPU rendered display classes (flash.display.Sprite, flash.display.MovieClip) and another high-density graphics mode uses Starling. I can switch between and use these happily, and I can switch between windowed mode at 720p to fullscreen mode just fine.</p>  <p>However, I just added a StageWebView to easily add some HTML based content, and I'm having trouble with resize. If I don't call "new Starling()" then the StageWebView instance will correctly resize to maintain the same relative screen dimensions when I switch from windowed to FullScreen. However, as soon as I create a Starling instance, the StageWebView will not correctly resize on fullscreen; it retains the absolute dimensions originally specified. If I don't instantiate Starling, the StageWebView resizes perfectly.</p>  <p>Do I need an event handler for Event.RESIZE to specifically adjust the viewPort member of the StageWebView object? How do I get the correct relative dimensions from the original fixed windowed size? (I tried looking at stage width/height and the numbers were oddly large, with AIR failing to build a new Rectangle correctly).</p>  <p>I would appreciate any sample code for anyone who has solved this problem. Thanks.</p>
