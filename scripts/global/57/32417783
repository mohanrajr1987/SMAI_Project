<p>Simplest code example: in a fresh desktop air project, with a few lines of code:</p>  <pre><code>import flash.system.Capabilities; trace(Capabilities.os); // returns "Windows 8" on a Windows 10 machine </code></pre>  <p>I haven't tried it on systems where Windows 10 has been installed from scratch, but on both a windows 7 -> windows 10 upgrade and a windows 8 -> windows 10 upgrade, it looks like Air's Capabilities class is returning the wrong value, even though I can run something like <code>wmic os get Caption</code> on the command line and get back "Microsoft Windows 10."</p>  <p>Any ideas?</p>
