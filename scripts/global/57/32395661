<p>I've created an AIR application and it seems to be working fine but when I drag the title bar to move the native window it shakes violently and have seizures while it's dragging about. </p>  <p>FYI It does eventually end up where I want it to be when I stop moving the mouse. </p>  <p>I'm using Flex 4.6 and AIR 3.6 on Mac OSX 10.10.5. It's a <code>s:WindowedApplication</code> I'm also using the DragManager on a list in part of the application if that matters but it is not enabled until the user clicks into the list and moves more than a certain number of pixels. </p>  <p>Here is my descriptor file minus name and version info:  </p>  <pre><code>&lt;application xmlns="http://ns.adobe.com/air/application/3.6"&gt;     &lt;initialWindow&gt;         &lt;autoOrients&gt;false&lt;/autoOrients&gt;         &lt;fullScreen&gt;false&lt;/fullScreen&gt;         &lt;visible&gt;false&lt;/visible&gt;     &lt;/initialWindow&gt; &lt;/application&gt; </code></pre>  <p>On initialize I run this: </p>  <pre><code>protected function initializeHandler(event:FlexEvent):void {      width = Capabilities.screenResolutionX * .96;     height = Capabilities.screenResolutionY * .9;      nativeWindow.x = (Screen.mainScreen.bounds.width - width)/2;     nativeWindow.y = (Screen.mainScreen.bounds.height - height)/2;  } </code></pre>  <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong><br> I removed the main view component so it is an empty application and it drags around smoothly. </p>  <p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong><br> I added the main view back in and dragged around step by step along the way. It appears to start happening when I've loaded a second Application (called a sub application) into the main application. I'm not sure though. </p>
