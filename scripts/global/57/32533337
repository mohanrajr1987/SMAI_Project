<p>I would like to use ActionScript3 to write "Hello World" to a text file.  I'd like to compile and run that code from the command line.</p>  <p>Installed: Windows 10, Adobe AIR 18.0 SDK, flex_sdk_4.6</p>  <p>(TLDR: I want to do automated testing for a much larger piece of code from the command line, and of course I can't figure out this piece)</p>  <p>I am missing some steps that I can't figure out.  Here's my code:</p>  <p>MainF.as</p>  <pre><code>package {     import flash.display.*;     import flash.text.*;     import flash.filesystem.*;      public class MainF extends Sprite     {         public function MainF()         {             var file:File =  new File("output.txt");             var stream:FileStream = new FileStream();             stream.open(file, FileMode.WRITE);             stream.writeUTFBytes("Hello World!");             stream.close();         }     } } </code></pre>  <p>I ran this command first:</p>  <pre><code>amxmlc MainF.as -dump-config aircfg.xml </code></pre>  <p>And now I am using this to compile my project:</p>  <pre><code>amxmlc MainF.as -load-config aircfg.xml </code></pre>  <p>My AirSdk\bin path is in my PATH environment variable, so it finds AirSdk\bin\amxmlc.bat correctly.</p>  <p>I have tried compiling this with the air compiler (shown above) and the flex compiler (flex_sdk_4.6\bin\mxmlc.exe).  Everything I have tried has this error:</p>  <pre><code>Warning: No definitions matching flash.filesystem.* could be found.         import flash.filesystem.*; </code></pre>  <p>This answer has not resolved my issue: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5446536/flash-builder-1172-definition-could-not-be-found">Flash Builder: 1172 Definition Could not be found</a></p>  <p>I need much more specific instructions, I'm very new to AS3.  And, as I said, I need it to work when compiled and run from the command line.</p>
