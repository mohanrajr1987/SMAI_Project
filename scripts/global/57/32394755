<p>I'm trying to get an old Flex project up and running.  (It was written by someone else, in Flash Builder.  I've imported it into FDT).</p>  <p>I've noticed that all my MXML image links are all broken.</p>  <p>I thought I could remedy this by adding the assets directory to the package contents.  (Project Properties -> FDT AIR Properties -> Desktop ... added the assets directory)  But it didn't help.</p>  <p>I found a work-around.  I simply say:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;mx:Image source="@Embed('assets/picture.png')" </code></pre>  <p>Instead of:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;mx:Image source="assets/picture.png" </code></pre>  <p>I also tried /assets, /src/assets, ../assets/, /..assets/ etc... (by the way, assets is a subdirectory of src)</p>  <p>But I'm curious why adding the assets directory to the package didn't work.  And given that the project must have worked before as-is - I'd like to make it work for me, without modification.</p>
