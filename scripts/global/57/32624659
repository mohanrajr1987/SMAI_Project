<p>Why FLVPlayback can't play video file on <code>File.applicationStorageDirectory</code> path? Let's say the file path is <code>/Users/my user/Library/Application Support/my app/Local Store/cache/9e136f394a080a5b537d1ecaca6773d4</code> that's achieved by write video file to <code>File.applicationStorageDirectory.resolvePath("cache/9e136f394a080a5b537d1ecaca6773d4")</code></p>  <p>If I set the source file directly to <code>FLVPlayback</code> object on the editor, the video preview is loaded. But not when I run it, the <code>FLVPlayback</code> is blank.</p>  <p>PS: It can be played if I place the file on project directory. so the file is not the issue.</p>
