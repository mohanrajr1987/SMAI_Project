<p>I'm a little bit confused about Admob mediation, (question 1) can I use the mediation with this ane <a href="https://github.com/lancelot1/ane-admob" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/lancelot1/ane-admob</a> ? </p>  <p>I'm not sure if I need to do some extra setup inside the app, or it's just as simple as that, to just change settings in Admob dashboard without any code modifications.</p>  <p>My seconds question: I already have few apps using that ane, (question 2) can I just setup Admob mediation on Admob dashboard or do I need to launch a new update of my games with updated code ?</p>  <p>Thank you very much</p>
