<p>I've just noticed in my AIR application that redo is not working. It also seems that there it only is going back one step (but sometimes two or three). </p>  <pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt; &lt;s:WindowedApplication xmlns:fx="http://ns.adobe.com/mxml/2009"                         xmlns:s="library://ns.adobe.com/flex/spark"                         xmlns:mx="library://ns.adobe.com/flex/mx"&gt;     &lt;fx:Declarations&gt;         &lt;!-- Place non-visual elements (e.g., services, value objects) here --&gt;     &lt;/fx:Declarations&gt;      &lt;s:TextArea horizontalCenter="0" verticalCenter="0" /&gt; &lt;/s:WindowedApplication&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I'm using CMD + Z for undo and CMD + Z + Shift for redo. I'm sure this was working at one point. Maybe it was only in the browser? </p>  <p>I'm using Flex 4.6 and AIR 3.6. I'm using Mac 10.10.5. I'm using Firefox 40.3. I also tried it in Safari. </p>  <p>Undo and redo work correctly in the text fields in both of those browsers using the same shortcut combinations listed. </p>
