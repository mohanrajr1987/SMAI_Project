<p>Similar to the WhatsApp 'Add Participants' to a new group feature, in my app I have a UITextField where the user can begin searching for contacts which also have the app installed to add to a group chat.</p>  <p>I store all of the available contacts in an NSMutableArray searchableContacts with the following keys</p>  <p>"firstName" "lastName" "phoneNumber"</p>  <p>Using the following delegate method, I would like to check the current input in the UITextField and see if it matches either part of the firstName OR lastName in the searchableContacts array:</p>  <pre><code>-(void)textFieldDidChange :(UITextField *)theTextField{      // Check if the user input matches the beginning of either firstName or lastName in contactsArray. If so, output that user information to the tableView  } </code></pre>
