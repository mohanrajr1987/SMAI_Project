<p>I have a CustomObject(of type NSObject) having an NSMutableArray property. This property contains NSDictionary objects. I need a deep copy of just the property to allow for editing in a different view controller; after editing, I desire to replace the original property with the edited deep copied property. </p>  <p><strong>My question is:</strong></p>  <blockquote>   <ul>   <li>Do I need to make a deep 'copyWithZone' ?</li>   <li>and if so, how do I implement it considering that it's just the single property that requires deep copying? </li>   </ul> </blockquote>  <p>I've for now circumvented this by doing:</p>  <pre><code>NSMutableArray *deepCopyArray = [NSMutableArray arrayWithArray:[NSKeyedUnarchiver unarchiveObjectWithData:[NSKeyedArchiver archivedDataWithRootObject:&lt;CustomObject&gt;instance.&lt;propertyToDeepCopy&gt;]]]; </code></pre>  <p>Although this works as NSMutableArray &amp; NSDictionary implement NSCoding, it doesn't feel the right way, or is it? Kindly help :)</p>
