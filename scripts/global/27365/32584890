<p>I have 10 <code>NSMutableArrays</code> and I need to compare them by its count and select the name of the array which has the lowest count - <code>[array count]</code>. What would be the best and fastest method to do so? </p>  <p>I tried to add the names of all arrays into another array, loop through with <code>'for'</code> method, but it doesn't work as <code>NSUInteger</code> conflicts with ID</p>  <p>There must be simpler method, I am sure of it. I just can't find the right reference on google...</p>  <p>Can you please point me the right direction?</p>  <p>Many thanks a. </p>
