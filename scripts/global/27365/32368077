<p>I have an array with custom objects. Now what I need to do is when ever an element will be added or removed I need a method to be called where I'll compute totalCost. Is it possible??</p>  <pre><code>class Company {     var name: String?     ....     ....     var employees[Employee] = []     var totalCost: Float = 0 }  class Employee {     var name: String?     .....     .....     var salary: Float = 0 } </code></pre>  <p>I have an option to override getter method of <code>totalCost</code> where I need go through all the employee object to calculate totalCost. But I don't want to do this cause I might have a huge number of employees and on every call this iteration can be a expensive operation. </p>  <p>Any suggestion will be appreciable.   </p>
