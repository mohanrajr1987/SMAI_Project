<p>I'm trying to use the input on an NSTextField along with NSPredicate to populate a NSMutableArray of like objects.</p>  <p>In my app I have the following simple NSMutableArray</p>  <pre><code>{         firstName = Danton;         phoneNumbers = 5555555555; } </code></pre>  <p>Now, I am using the following code to try and filter the results as the user types (if "Dan" is in the textField, the filtered array should include the above object)</p>  <pre><code>NSMutableArray *filteredArray = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];  NSPredicate *sPredicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@"firstName CONTAINS[cd] %@", self.searchField.text];  filteredArray = [[filteredArray filteredArrayUsingPredicate:sPredicate] mutableCopy];  NSLog(@"Filtered values: %@", filteredArray); </code></pre>  <p>However, I am getting an empty return on filteredArray. Can someone tell me what is wrong with my code?</p>
