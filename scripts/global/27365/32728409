<p>I have two <code>array</code>, called <code>array1</code> and <code>array2</code>. I would like to remove every object from <code>array1</code> that's value of the <code>"nameId"</code> key can be find in both array. Actually I'm trying it in a <code>for loop</code>, but it doesn't make sense. It doesn not crash, it just simply calls the log in the <code>else statement</code>, that I don't understand why happens. Maybe somebody could show me the right solution. </p>  <pre><code>NSMutableArray *newArray = [self.array1 mutableCopy];  for (PFObject * object in newArray) {      PFObject *placeholderObject = object;      for (PFObject *object2 in self.array2) {          if ([placeholderObject[@"nameId"] isEqualToString:object2[@"nameId"]]) {              [self.array1 removeObject:object];              NSLog (@"EXISTING OBJECT FOUND %@", object);         } else {               NSLog(@"UNIQUE OBJECT FOUND %@", idO[@"hirCime"]);          }       }   } </code></pre>
