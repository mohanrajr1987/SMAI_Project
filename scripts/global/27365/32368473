<p>I have an NSArray loaded with objects (see below).   I need to load these into a tableview based on which indexpath.row is clicked from another tableview.</p>  <p>If a user selects indexpath.row = 0, then the second tableview is reloaded with ORDER_CODE's which contain only GROUP = 0. If the user selects indexpath.row = 1, then the second tableview is reloaded with ORDER_CODE's which contain only GROUP = 1.</p>  <p>Anyone have any advice/coding on how I can search thru the array and display the relevant data into the second tableview?</p>  <pre><code>array=(         {         GROUP = 0;         "ORDER_CODE" = 410;         "PROD_DESCR" = "cement";         id = 0;     },         {         GROUP = 0;         "ORDER_CODE" = 411;         "PROD_DESCR" = "concrete";         id = 1;     },         {         GROUP = 1;         "ORDER_CODE" = 405;         "PROD_DESCR" = "asphalt";         id = 2;     }) </code></pre>
