<p>We have a Ruby on Sinatra application. We use sidekiq and redis for queue process.</p>  <p>We already implemented and using sidekiq that queues up jobs that does insertion into database. it works pretty fine till now.</p>  <p>Now I wanted to add another jobs which will read bulk data from database and export to csv file.</p>  <p>I donot want both this job to be in same queue instead is there possible to create different queue for these jobs in same application?</p>  <p>Please give some solution.</p>
