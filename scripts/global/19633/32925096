<p>In Sinatra, how to redirect back to a route?</p>  <pre><code>require 'sinatra'  get "/A" do   redirect '/B'  end  get "/B" do    redirect request.referer end </code></pre>  <p>This is the code, and I want "/B" bring me back to "/A".   </p>  <p>Now, in browser, in "/C", send a get request to "/A". I will then go back to "/C". The reason is:<br> The "request.referer" is recording "/C", because the redirect in "/A" is initiated by the server, it doesn't count as the referrer to the target page.   </p>  <p>There is a JavaScript way solving it(placed on /A):   </p>  <pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;window.location = '/B';&lt;/script&gt; </code></pre>  <p>(Got this from:<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26016053/how-to-redirect-web-page-from-a-specfic-page-in-sinatra#">How to redirect web page from a specfic page in Sinatra?</a>)  </p>  <p>My question is how to redirect back to a route in server side?</p>
