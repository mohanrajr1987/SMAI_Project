<p>I have the sqlite3 gem in my Gemfile.  Running 'bundle install' works without errors.  When running a dababase migration using Rake:</p>  <pre><code>rake db:create_migration NAME=create_messages </code></pre>  <p>I get the following error:</p>  <pre><code>rake aborted! LoadError: Could not load 'active_record/connection_adapters/sqlite_adapter'. Make sure that the adapter in config/database.yml is valid. If you use an adapter other than 'mysql', 'mysql2', 'postgresql' or 'sqlite3' add the necessary adapter gem to the Gemfile. </code></pre>  <p>I even tried specifying sqlite3 with 1.3.3 and then with 1.3.4 versions in the Gemfile but that did not resolve the issue.  Ruby version is 1.9.3</p>  <p>Following is from my environments.rb file:</p>  <pre><code>configure :development do  set :database, 'sqlite:///dev.db'  set :show_exceptions, true end </code></pre>  <p>Following is from Gemfile:</p>  <pre><code>source 'https://rubygems.org' #ruby "1.9.3"  gem "sinatra" gem "activerecord" gem "sinatra-activerecord" gem 'sinatra-flash' gem 'sinatra-redirect-with-flash'  group :development do  gem 'sqlite3-ruby'  gem "tux" end </code></pre>  <p>I have also tried sqlite3 in place of sqlite3-ruby but that did not solve the issue.  </p>
