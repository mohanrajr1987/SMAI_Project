<p>I'm about to begin working on a Gem for Ruby (not necessarily for web application). My Gem will require a web interface for controlling the Gem. The web interface must have some basic authentication and authorization.</p>  <p>I know Sinatra is lite, but are there other (smaller) web-servers that meet the requirements?</p>  <p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>  <p>I should elaborate: By controlling interface I meant an interface for viewing and editing DB (probably Redis) rows. Super simple.</p>
