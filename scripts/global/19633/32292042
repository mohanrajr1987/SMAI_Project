<p>I just set up a db.t2.micro instance on Amazon's AWS. I am using sinatra to load a localhost webpage. I am using Active Record to do maybe about 30~ queries and it's taking 92 seconds to load. It's extremely slow. I tried doing custom parameters as listed here: <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_BestPractices.html#CHAP_BestPractices.PostgreSQL" rel="nofollow">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_BestPractices.html#CHAP_BestPractices.PostgreSQL</a></p>  <p>This didn't help speed anything up. I'm not sure how I can speed up this instance. This is my first time hosting a database. Any help would be appreciated. </p>  <p>When I run my sinatra app it host locally(localhost). Here is where the 30~ queries are taking 92 seconds to load. When I run select * statements in Postgres they take only a couple seconds.</p>
