<p>Im currently trying to get i18n with rack-contrib/locale up an running with my Padrino app, but right now Im stuck.</p>  <p>My code so far in boot.rb:</p>  <pre><code>require 'rack/contrib/locale'  Padrino.before_load do     Padrino.use Rack::Locale     I18n.default_locale = :en     I18n.enforce_available_locales = false end </code></pre>  <p>The locale is read out of the HTTP request headers by rack-contrib/locale, but I need some way to tell rack-locale to discard the region keys, since I get "translation missing" errors for de-de and de-DE although I defined everything needed in de.yml under the de: tag.</p>  <p>It also seems that rack-locale disables the default locale mechanism in i18n, since Im seeing the "translation missing" errors although the default locale is defined and en.yml is existing.</p>
