<p>I have problems with my open connections with RethinkDB. If errors occur in my Sinatra back-end app methods, the connection with Rethink is not closed. Therefore the number of open connections slowly increases.</p>  <p>This results in too many open connections, resulting in the error:</p>  <pre><code>Error: the RethinkDB database is not available </code></pre>  <p>So questions is twofold: First to help me out right now; how can I close the open Rethink connections? Secondly, how can I avoid the build-up of open connections? Should I open a connection for every call to my back-end, or should I just open a connection with Rethink once when my app is initiated?</p>  <p>Rethink looks promising, but a little help would be greatly appreciated!</p>
