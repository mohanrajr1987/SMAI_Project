<p>I am trying to run the code in <a href="https://github.com/openjournals/theoj" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/openjournals/theoj</a> on my computer. This is the first time I used ruby so I started by installing ruby from <a href="http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/" rel="nofollow">http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/</a>. I installed the program and nothing happened. The files in <a href="https://github.com/openjournals/theoj" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/openjournals/theoj</a> are not associated with the ruby program I installed. </p>  <p>Why is this not working? Am I doing something wrong?</p>
