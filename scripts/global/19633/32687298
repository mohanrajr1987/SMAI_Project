<p>I can't seem to get this to work. I try to run <code>bundle exec rake db:migrate</code> after running <code>bundle exec rake db:create</code> and it gives me this error: </p>  <p><code>rake aborted! PG::ConnectionBad: fe_sendauth: no password supplied /home/david/DBC/survey-gorilla-challenge/Rakefile:106:in block (2 levels) in &lt;top (required)&gt;' Tasks: TOP =&gt; db:migrate (See full trace by running task with --trace)</code></p>  <p>I've tried looking around, but it all seems like a solution for rails, whereas I'm using this with Sinatra and activerecord. I'm not sure if that makes any difference. I even tried changing my <code>pg_hba.conf</code>, which looks like this currently: </p>  <p><code>IPv4 local connections: host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            md5  IPv6 local connections: host     all             all             ::1/128                 md5</code></p>  <p>I'm not sure how to get this working. Any help is appreciated. </p>
