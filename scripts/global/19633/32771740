<p>I am setting up a container manually to create a proper Docker file. </p>  <p>I am starting from bitnami/ruby:latest a container with the following syntax:</p>  <pre><code>sudo docker run -p 4567:4567 --name vcaexplorer bitnami/ruby bash </code></pre>  <p>The container gets instantiated correctly: </p>  <pre><code>CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                 CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                              NAMES 1ac394d247a4        bitnami/ruby        "/entrypoint.sh bash"   37 minutes ago      Up 37 minutes       3000/tcp, 0.0.0.0:4567-&gt;4567/tcp   vcaexplorer </code></pre>  <p>I am downloading the follwoing repo with this syntax: </p>  <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/mreferre/vcautils.git /app/vcautils </code></pre>  <p>I then start the Sinatra app in the /app/vcautils/lib directory. </p>  <p>It looks like this: </p>  <pre><code>bitnami@1ac394d247a4:/app/vcautils/lib$ ruby vcaexplorer.rb  vcaexplorer.rb:36: warning: already initialized constant OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_PEER vcaexplorer.rb:39: warning: class variable access from toplevel vcaexplorer.rb:40: warning: class variable access from toplevel vcaexplorer.rb:41: warning: class variable access from toplevel [2015-09-24 21:42:48] INFO  WEBrick 1.3.1 [2015-09-24 21:42:48] INFO  ruby 2.2.3 (2015-08-18) [x86_64-linux] == Sinatra (v1.4.6) has taken the stage on 4567 for development with backup from WEBrick [2015-09-24 21:42:48] INFO  WEBrick::HTTPServer#start: pid=255 port=4567 </code></pre>  <p>when I try to connect to <code>dockerhost:4567</code> it gives me a black eye. It says there is nothing there. </p>  <p>I tried to install net-utils in the container and I started the Sinatra app in background (with <code>&amp;</code>). It seems to be starting in background but when I run netstat nothing is listed (but the process is there). </p>  <p>The docker host is in good shape because if I try other containers all the internal NATting works fine and I can access the containers from the outside. </p>  <p>Even the app is in good shape as if I start it locally on my laptop with the same command it gives me the same "output" and I can connect to <code>localhost:4567</code></p>  <p>It must be something with the way I am instantiating the container (using bash?) </p>  <p>Thoughts? </p>  <p>Thanks. Massimo. </p>
