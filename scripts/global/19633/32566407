<p>I've got an ordinary rails app which now gets some widgets which are rendered inside a Sinatra app.</p>  <p>On my local machine I run <code>rails s</code> and <code>ruby lib/sinatra/widget.rb</code> which then fetches stuff from the rails app. As a result <code>localhost:3000</code> and <code>localhost:4567</code> work fine together.</p>  <p>How can I do all this in a staging environment? The deployment itself is working and the rails app starts up. How can I access the Sinatra stuff now?</p>  <p>One idea would be mounting the Sinatra app to some path in the rails app? Any ideas, suggestions?</p>
