<p>Please help me to understand the following Sinatra::Aplication.instance_variables. I would like to know ideas on how to use them say for debugging for one and any other ways they might be applied.</p>  <pre><code>[:@conditions, :@routes, :@filters, :@errors, :@middleware, :@prototype, :@extensions, :@templates] </code></pre>  <p>Any examples or samples of how people might use them would be fine rather than a tutorial post here. Just quickies would be great. (links included)</p>
