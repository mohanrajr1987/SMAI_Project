<p>I've been dealing with this problem.  I'm working with active record + OCI8 + Sinatra, And I'm not able to run migrations (because I have not access to admin user on database, but I could send queries to my oracle admin).</p>  <p>This is my model</p>  <pre><code>class Modify &lt; ActiveRecord::Base   self.sequence_name = "PRM_W01.seq_modifies"   belongs_to :parameter end </code></pre>  <p>But when I tried to create a new user I had this output</p>  <pre><code>D, [2015-08-31T16:50:34.636767 #4696] DEBUG -- :   Primary Key (7.5ms)  SELECT cc.column_name FROM all_constraints c, all_cons_columns cc WHERE c.owner = 'PRM_W01' AND c.table_name = 'MODIFIES' AND c.constraint_type = 'P' AND cc.owner = c.owner AND cc.constraint_name = c.constraint_name D, [2015-08-31T16:50:34.639891 #4696] DEBUG -- :   Primary Key Trigger (2.5ms)            SELECT trigger_name           FROM all_triggers           WHERE owner = 'PRM_W01'             AND trigger_name = 'MODIFIES_PKT'             AND table_owner = 'PRM_W01'             AND table_name = 'MODIFIES'             AND status = 'ENABLED'  OCIError: ORA-00942: table or view does not exist </code></pre>  <p>I was reading <a href="http://oracle-enhanced.rubyforge.org/rdoc/classes/ActiveRecord/ConnectionAdapters/OracleEnhancedAdapter.html#M000032" rel="nofollow">this</a> </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Create primary key trigger (so that you can skip primary key value in   INSERT statement). By default trigger name will be “table_name_pkt“,   you can override the name with :trigger_name option (but it is not   recommended to override it as then this trigger will not be detected   by ActiveRecord model and it will still do prefetching of sequence   value).</p> </blockquote>  <p>So I think that my problem is that I didn't create that trigger, but I don't know how to migration does, could anybody help me to get that code? </p>
