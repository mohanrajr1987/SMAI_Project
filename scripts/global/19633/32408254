<p>I am trying to only allow a person to see the page if their name is in the database. I figured the best way to go about it was to loop through all of the entries and check if it matches, if it does then display it and stop looping. I keep getting a blank page, any help?</p>  <pre><code>get '/' do   user  = "john"   num = DB[:users].all    for person in num  do     if person[:name].to_s == user then       File.read('index.html')       break     else        "you're not authorized"     end   end  end </code></pre>  <p>If I were to remove the line that says break within the if statement, I get this error:</p>  <pre><code>  NoMethodError at /   undefined method `bytesize' for #&lt;Hash:0x007fcf60970a68&gt;   file: utils.rb location: bytesize line: 369 </code></pre>
