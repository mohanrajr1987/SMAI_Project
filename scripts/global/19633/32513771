<p>I am trying to build a Ruby on Rails application for Bigcommerce. They don't have a RoR hello world app, but they have a hello world sinatra app. I am trying to get that one up and running so I can figure out how that works and then get one working with Rails.</p>  <p>I clone the repo (<a href="https://github.com/bigcommerce/hello-world-app-ruby-sinatra" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/bigcommerce/hello-world-app-ruby-sinatra</a>) and follow the instructions verbatim, however I am getting an <code>Invalid request: Invalid HTTP format, parsing fails</code> error in terminal, and a screen that shows "SSL protocol error" within Bigcommerce's iFrame (using chrome).</p>  <p>I don't know how to trace this error - it may not even be my fault, maybe requirements on Bigcommerce's side have changed and just haven't updated their hello world app. Why am I getting this error, and how can I fix it?</p>
