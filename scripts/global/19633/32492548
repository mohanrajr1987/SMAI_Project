<p>I have a reference to a Model object called Admin which has a field called id.  The object property is accessible in the puts line.  I now need to pass in that ID into an ActiveRecord call to create another object (where it serves as foreign key) as follows but it throws an exception copied below (the admin.id does not get picked up in the Bill.create call):</p>  <pre><code>admin = Admin.find_by(email:email) puts "admin id #{admin.id}"  # this gets printed with correct value   bill = Bill.create(admin_id: admin.id, body: body) </code></pre>  <p><strong>Exception</strong>:</p>  <pre><code>/usr/local/rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.1/gems/activerecord-4.2.4/lib/active_record/attribute_assignment.rb:59:in `rescue in _assign_attribute': unknown attribute 'admin_id' for Bill.
