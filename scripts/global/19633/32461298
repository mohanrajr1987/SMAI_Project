<p>Some of my files in my Sinatra server's public folder have a '+' in their names.  When I try to access these files via browser, I get a 404 error. There is no additional log output.</p>  <p>I triple-checked that the files do exist and the URL is correct. I can access other files in the public folder. If I rename these files, so they don't contain a '+' in their name, I can access them as well.</p>  <p>Unfortunately, I can not avoid having '+' characters in my filenames.</p>  <p>Has this been experienced before?</p>
