<h2>The gist</h2>  <p>Is it possible to bake feature-toggle-like functionality into a <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com" rel="nofollow">Sinatra</a> application?</p>  <p><a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureToggle.html" rel="nofollow">A bit about feature toggles, just in-case ;)</a></p>  <h2>Back story</h2>  <p>I've set up a modular Sinatra project, and I tend to implement a <code>GET</code>/<code>POST</code>/<code>PUT</code>/<code>DELETE</code> endpoint for all my resources; it makes it easier to test the app and manipulate the data while in development.</p>  <h2>Problem</h2>  <p>When I go into production I don't want the unneeded endpoints to exist (e.g <code>DELETE '/users'</code>).</p>  <h2>Question</h2>  <p>Can I annotate the methods with some kind of a <code>:development</code> flag, or maybe intercept the request in a before block? Would you do this using a helper? I'm not sure if I'm heading down the right path here, I'm probably over complicating it(?)</p>  <p>How would one go about this?</p>  <p>If you've done something like this it would be great if you can share your findings with the nation.</p>
