<p>Seek issue: Click “Fastforward” button once when a YouTube video is paying , the video progress bar will go forward 10 seconds and then start playback. If only implements Fastforward once with our browser, the video can play well. But if we press Fastforward button multiple times in a short time, the video can’t continue to play and the page will keep to display  “Loading…” . We found only Audio sourceBuffer was appended on, but video bufferdata wasn’t appended. Sometimes only video bufferdata was appended.</p>  <p>What the conditions are to append audio and video bufferdata after multiple seeks in YouTube Java Script page?</p>
