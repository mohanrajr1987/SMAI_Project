<p>I Wanted to know is there any WebKit port for C# (.NET). As far as I found there is only this <a href="http://webkitdotnet.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">WebKit.Net</a> port which was first hosted on Sourceforge and then moved on to <a href="https://github.com/webkitdotnet" rel="nofollow">Github</a>. But the problem is it was last updated 2 years ago in 2013 which is now old. So is there any other port of WebKit for C# which is in active development ? If not, how can I my self port WebKit for C# ?</p>
