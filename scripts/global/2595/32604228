<p>I am trying to use Picture in Picture in the WKWebView while the user can continue to use the app. </p>  <p>The problem I am having is that the WKWebView is in it's own View Controller and I do not receive a notification for when the user is trying to restore the video or closes it. But I need to know when the view controller can be removed or when it needs to be presented again so i can restore the view controller again. </p>  <p>I am missing a NSNotification somewhere?</p>
