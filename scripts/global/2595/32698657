<p>I have a problem with the Content property in webkit. If the value of content is empty it is not working. With all other browsers work but not with webkit ...</p>  <p>Look at this code:</p>  <p><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/s2pf4wmg/1/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/s2pf4wmg/1/</a></p>  <p>The problem is here:</p>  <pre><code>#list li::before {   content:""; //this is problem   display: list-item; } </code></pre>  <p>This code works very well with chrome, firefox, IE ecc. In those browser before each item of ul <em>#list</em> there is only one list-style. But in safari doesn't work! in safari there are TWO list-style (two circle). </p>  <p>If i want to see my code work in webkit i must change this:</p>  <pre><code>#list li::before {   /*  content:""; */   display: list-item; } </code></pre>  <p>Why this problem ?</p>
