<p>I've seen other questions addressing this issue but none of the solutions work for me.  Basically I have a sidebar that has:</p>  <pre><code>.sidebar {     width: 300px;     position: absolute;     top: 0;     right: -300px; } </code></pre>  <p>And when I click a button I want the sidebar to slide into view from the right while also pushing the rest of the content over to the left.  So I added a wrapper around the sidebar and all of the content, with an inner wrapper inside of that:</p>  <pre><code>.site-wrapper {   overflow-x: hidden;    .site-wrapper-inner {     -webkit-transition: -webkit-transform 0.3s ease;             transition: transform 0.3s ease;      &amp;.shifted {       -webkit-transform: translate3d(-$sidebarWidth, 0, 0);               transform: translate3d(-$sidebarWidth, 0, 0);     }   } } </code></pre>  <p>When a button is clicked, the <strong>shifted</strong> class is added to the inner wrapper, and everything slides over 300px to the left (including the sidebar, which comes into view perfectly).  It works great, except on Sarafi mobile browser.  In this case, there is a horizontal scrollbar that you can use to go and look at the sidebar...and it messes up the whole layout.  I added overflow-x to not only the outer wrapper but also html and body, and I still have the scrollbar.  I'm pulling my hair out over this...overflow-x simply is not respected if the sidebar is positioned absolutely outside of the bounds, and only in mobile safari...</p>
