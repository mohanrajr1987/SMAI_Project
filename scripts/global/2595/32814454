<p>I know ngTouch removes the default 300ms delay on mobile to make for a better mobile experience, but it makes mobile link taps occur so quickly that the <code>-webkit-tap-highlight-color</code> style no longer works. There are a few elements that I need to have that highlight style. Is it possible to add attributes or get ngTouch to have at least a little bit of a delay for those elements, say 100ms? P.S. I tried adding the highlight style on the <code>ng-click-active</code> style and that didn't work. I also added a JS interceptor that applies a highlight class manually on click, but that didn't work either.</p>
