<p>Sorry for a long introduction of the problem.</p>  <p>In my app I am using recording audio and set category to record</p>  <pre><code>AVAudioSession *session = [AVAudioSession sharedInstance]; [session setCategory:AVAudioSessionCategoryRecord error:&amp;err]; </code></pre>  <p>When an ad network shows interstitial ad, after that recording is all mute (there is no sound in recording). As this happens with users on live network only, I am not able to reproduce it at my end. </p>  <p>In the log I get "<strong>>>>> frameSizeChanged = 4096</strong>" from users which points to webkit code  <a href="https://github.com/WebKit/webkit/blob/master/Source/WebCore/platform/audio/ios/AudioDestinationIOS.cpp" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/WebKit/webkit/blob/master/Source/WebCore/platform/audio/ios/AudioDestinationIOS.cpp</a></p>  <p>This looks like some process is holding on to Audio Unit setup and not letting it go even after it is completed(freed / released).</p>  <p>Question: Is there a way to clean up audio unit setup by some other module? Just need to reset so that recording can work again in app after the ad is shown.</p>  <p>I have tried to capture "AVAudioSessionInterruptionNotification" but there is none. Any help is really appreciated</p>
