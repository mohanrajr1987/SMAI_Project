<p>DRM issue : The normal decryption process is : 1.      The player throws a needkey event 2.      Webkit sends the event to Java Script 3.      Call ‘webkitGenerateKeyRequest’ of Java Script ‘HTMLMediaElement’ to generate a ‘Request’, then interacts with the license server to get the key 4.    Call ‘addkey’ to send the key to browser webkit, then pass the key to the player. If these steps are completed , the player could play the encrypted videos.</p>  <p>On our platform, the player starts 2 needkey events at the beginning of the video play, and the key is obtained successfully every time. But after about 10 seconds playback, the player will throw the 3rd needkey event, and step 3 is not completed this time, no key can be sent to browser. So the video play has to stop.</p>  <p>Is there any conditions according to which YouTube Java Script will implements “webkitGenerateKeyRequest”?</p>
