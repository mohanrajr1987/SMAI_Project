<p>I am working on an <code>Angular</code> app that will be deployed on webkit :</p>  <pre><code>Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686) AppleWebKit/534.34 (KHTML, like Gecko) Qt/4.8.0 Safari/534.34 </code></pre>  <p>when I test in Chrome or Firefox everything works fine but when I run the app on webkit, some elements are not showing among other problems. How could I have test environment for that webkit on my windows 7 OS to test my <code>Angular</code> app before deploy it on the machine?</p>
