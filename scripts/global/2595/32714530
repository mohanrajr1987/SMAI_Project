<p>I have a class that is derived from NSView and wraps a WebView instance. This class is set as delegate for different parts (frame load, UI, policy and resource load). This compiles and works well with XCode 6.</p>  <p>After upgrading to XCode 7 I got errors, because the WebView's frameLoadDelegate etc. have been changed from just <code>id</code> to e.g. <code>id&lt;WebFrameLoadDelegate&gt;</code>. In order to make it compile again I changed the code to:</p>  <pre><code>@interface WebBrowser : NSView &lt;WebFrameLoadDelegate, WebUIDelegate, WebPolicyDelegate, WebResourceLoadDelegate&gt; { ... </code></pre>  <p>This compiles and works fine with XCode 7, but does not in XCode 6. Even though the delegates are defined there too and WebKit is included I still get errors that those delegates are unknown. What's the fix here to make it work in XCode 6 too?</p>  <p>I was thinking about wrapping the protocol part with an #if/#endif, but don't know what I could use as condition.</p>
