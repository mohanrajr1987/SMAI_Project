<p>When I play an encrypted video, the player throws NeedKey event, I sent MediaKeyNeededEvent to JS, JS calls webkitGenerateKeyRequest of HTMLMediaElement to generate request, then get to interact with key licence server, set licence key to the player</p>  <p><strong>But when I play a video, the player will throw NeedKey event many times, will throw twice at the start of play, then the player will throw the same event about 10 seconds later, when the third event thrown JS, webkitGenerateKeyRequest dose not called, And then the licence key is not set to player, so the video can not be played continue</strong></p>  <p>Has any EME developer to help confirm where is the problem</p>  <p>THX</p>
