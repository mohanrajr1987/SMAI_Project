<p>I'm trying to create a simlpe responsive layout (<a href="http://jsfiddle.net/5358bhhr/1/" rel="nofollow">JSFiddle</a>) for a web app and struggle with the rendering on mobile webkit browsers.<br> They shrink some of the floating elements in a (to me) unpredictable way.<br><br> Layouts work well with desktop browsers and Firefox and Opera on Android but not with Chrome on Android and seemingly Safari on iOS (tested with Kitkat smartphone and simulated in Chrome for Android and Apple devices):<br><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/94JyN.png" rel="nofollow">Simulated Nexus 4 Rendering</a><br>(Text in blue and orange areas should be as big as in the white area)<br><br> It seems it doesn't matter which exact CSS attributes I use; I tried CSS tables, boxes, floats, flex-boxes and lastly -webkit-boxes - all with the same result: Too small headers and footers<br><br> This is part of a project on Google Script, so unfortunately I am not in control of the viewport meta-tag, but a quick try with a local file and a <code>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"&gt;</code> tag didn't solve the issue either.<br><br> Has anyone experienced this before and has an idea how to fix it?<br><br> Thanks!</p>
