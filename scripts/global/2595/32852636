<p>I've download the files in the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/webkitdotnet/files/" rel="nofollow">http://sourceforge.net/projects/webkitdotnet/files/</a> and I made a browser application. On my pc windows 10 with VS2012 is working fine. But on my other pc with Win 7 again with vs 2012 is working but the webkit browser is not showing anything. There's no error but nothing it shows in the webkit browser. I made a setup, I've included all the dll files from the webkit and I've installed in several pc's. Same thing happen again. The program works fine without errors but the browser is blank. Any ideas?</p>
