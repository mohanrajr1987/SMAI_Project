<p>I'm creating a extension for chrome and I did a context menu which has a few options:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/GCXvh.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/GCXvh.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Technically it works fine, the problem is, that every entry of the menu has an icon assigned to it, styled with css. Normally the icons are grey until the get hovered. This worked fine for a long time and since yesterday it's broken and I dont know what i've changed to get it to that.</p>  <p>The status now ist, that when I'm opening the menu (happens via jQuery, its just a div which is hidden most of the time), all icons are invisible until I hover them. So if I move my mouse over "Call" now, it looks like this:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/nuj7y.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/nuj7y.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>When I unhover it, the icon stays visible and looks like its supposed to. So basically I can show all of the icons when I hover them once.</p>  <p>Now there are three things which are giving me a complete brainfuck:</p>  <ol> <li>I'm sure, persistent changes, meens something is in state a, you hover it and it gets into state b and stays in state b or goes to state c when you unhover it again, are impossible in CSS but thats exactly whats happening here and</li> <li><p>When I open the chrome developer tools and change <strong>anything</strong> in the css settings</p>  <p>Before: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/tcxOc.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/tcxOc.png" alt="enter image description here"></a> After <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5IOYA.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5IOYA.png" alt="enter image description here"></a> Every icon is displayed correctly (not in case of the changed css property of course but It stays visible when you turn it back on). Its completely irrelevant which of the css properties you change, whenever you change it, the images pop up.</p></li> <li><p>The context menu is a div. It gets hidden and shown through jQuerys <code>slideUp</code> and <code>slideDown</code> functions so it never gets reset, just hidden and shown from time to time. Now when I hover all of the icons to make them visible, close the menu (clicking somewhere otuside it) and open it again, the icons are invisible. </p></li> </ol>  <p>Now I experimented with the css properties in my css file and I found something out. My Icons are grayscaled when theyre not hovered. In css it looks like this</p>  <pre><code>-webkit-filter: grayscale(100%); filter: grayscale(100%); filter: gray; filter: url("data:image/svg+xml;utf8,&lt;svg version='1.1' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' height='0'&gt;&lt;filter id='greyscale'&gt;&lt;feColorMatrix type='matrix' values='0.3333 0.3333 0.3333 0 0 0.3333 0.3333 0.3333 0 0 0.3333 0.3333 0.3333 0 0 0 0 0 1 0' /&gt;&lt;/filter&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;#greyscale"); </code></pre>  <p>now when I comment out <code>-webkit-filter: grayscale(100%);</code>, the icons are not grayed out of course, but they show up like they should.</p>  <p>So how the f does this work?</p>
