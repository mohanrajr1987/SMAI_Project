<p>I made a program in Delphi to move windows to another screen/monitor reserving the state, size (if possible) and center the window on the screen if not fullscreen. Especially for borderless windows this is very useful because the easy window hotkeys of Windows do not work properly. </p>  <p>The function is a part of a software suite. I have tested this with fullscreen YouTube videos and works perfectly with mozilla, IE but not with Chrome and Opera (webkit), the window won't move.</p>  <p>Two questions:</p>  <ol> <li>What's the reason the window won't move?</li> <li>Can I move it with a trick or is trying to a waste of time?</li> </ol>  <p><strong>EDIT:</strong> <em>Found out that the chrome window doesn't respond to any message send to this window, for example, restoring, minimize and maximize the window doesn't do anything (tried also other things). Maybe there is something in the code of chrome that avoids it. Maybe someone can confirm this?</em></p>  <p>Some code (using Windows API func moveWindow() ):</p>  <pre><code>var  AHandle : Hwnd;  brCurrent : TBounds; // TBounds = TRect + width and height   iCurrDispNum : LongInt;  iNextDispNum : LongInt;  brNext       : TBounds;  begin     ........  AHandle:=getForeGroundWindow(); brCurrent:=getWindowBoundsRect( AHandle ); iCurrDispNum:=getDisplayNumFromBoundsRect( brCurrent ); iNextDispNum:=getNextDisplayNum( iCurrDispNum ) brNext:=getBoundsRectOnDisplay( iNextDispNum, brCurrent.width, brCurrent.height, alNone, TRUE );      ....... // Finally, move the window with WINAPI function, this does not work for chrome and opera fullscreen window, all other window work ok.       moveWindow( AHandle, brNext.left, brNext.top, brNext.width, brNext.height, TRUE );  // Find out if window is moved to other screen if( getDisplayNumFromBoundsRect( getWindowBoundsRect( AHandle )) &lt;&gt; iNextDispNum ) then  begin   // Error, window not moved  end; </code></pre>  <p><strong>You can try it yourself with this piece of code:</strong></p>  <p>Put a TTimer on a form and paste code below. What does it do? It checks if the foreground window is a chrome window and moves the window 20px to the left. When you maximize a YouTube video in chrome, the window won't move but moveWindow returns TRUE. Relying on the result of moveWindow is useless. NOTICE: This is just a quick example, not a brilliant piece of code. </p>  <pre><code>function getWindowClassName( AHandle : hWnd ) : string; begin     SetLength( Result, MAX_PATH );     SetLength( Result, getClassName( AHandle, PChar( Result ), length(Result))); end;  // Code in a TTimer proc procedure TForm1.Timer1Timer(Sender: TObject); var  h : Hwnd;  r : TRect;  begin  h:=getForeGroundWindow();  writeln( getClassName( h ) );  if( h &gt; 0 ) and ( getClassName( h ) = 'Chrome_WidgetWin_1' ) and ( getWindowRect( h, r )) then  begin   inc( r.left, 20 );   writeln( moveWindow( h, r.left, r.top, r.right-r.left+20, r.bottom-r.top, TRUE ) );   end; end; </code></pre>  <p>PS: You need to turn on "Generate Console Application" at the Project Options to avoid writeln I/O errors.</p>  <p>////////////////////</p>  <p>The properties of the chrome fullscreen window obtained with MS SPY doesn't show something weird is going on: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/6mqor.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/6mqor.png" alt="spyxx window properties of chrome fullscreen window"></a> </p>
