<p>I try to build Qt 5.4 from scratch including WebKit with ICU/Unicode support for Windows using VS2013. According to Qt's manuals I'm first setting the environment variables to point to the 32 bit binaries of ICU as downloaded from their webpage:</p>  <pre><code>SET INCLUDE=D:\Qt\icu\include;%INCLUDE% SET LIB=D:\Qt\icu\lib;%LIB% SET PATH=D:\Qt\icu\include;D:\Qt\icu\lib;%PATH% </code></pre>  <p>Next I'm doing a configure</p>  <pre><code>configure.bat -commercial -confirm-license -debug-and-release -release -force-debug-info -nomake tests -nomake examples -qt-zlib -qt-libjpeg -qt-libpng -plugin-sql-sqlite -no-openssl -opengl dynamic -icu -I D:\Qt\icu\include -L D:\Qt\icu\lib -prefix D:\Qt\Qt5.4.1\install\ </code></pre>  <p>This results in folllowing outputs:</p>  <pre><code>Third Party Libraries:     ...     ICU support.............yes  Additional libraries........-LD:\Qt\icu\lib </code></pre>  <p>But after doing "nmake" and "nmake install" I end up with Webkit-DLL's that do not depend on ICU and therefore fail to display my webpages containing Unicode.</p>  <p>So...any idea what is wrong here and why Qt does not make use of ICU although it recognises it correctly and does not show any build/link errors?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
