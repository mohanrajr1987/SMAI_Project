<p>I have a matrix like below</p>  <pre><code>data &lt;- replicate(30, rnorm(30))  </code></pre>  <p>I would like to make a network like this image <a href="http://www.forwardprogress.net/data-steps-effective-relationship-marketing-dean-delisle/" rel="nofollow">http://www.forwardprogress.net/data-steps-effective-relationship-marketing-dean-delisle/</a></p>  <p>of course the name of the variables (in this case V1 to V30 appeared)</p>  <p>is there any way to do it in R?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
