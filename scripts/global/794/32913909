<p>I am learning chord system. But I have a question about its querying algorithm. Why the finger table in chord only store the information of <code>successor(n+2^{i-1})</code> but not all the other nodes in the ring? Like in this picture,<a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/9CVFx.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/9CVFx.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>If I want to search key 7 at node 1. If node 1 stores all the address of nodes on the ring, since we obviously know the successor of 7 is 0, we can go directly to 0. Why should I go to node 6 first and use node 6 to route to 0. I am a little confused.</p>
