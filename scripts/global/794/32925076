<p>I'm setting up Vagrant on a university network. I don't want to use a public network as the university network is quite strict about what can connect. I'd rather use a private network. </p>  <p>The problem is, when using a private network Vagrant seems to create a network adapter on the machines, something the students don't have permission to do. Is there any way to set up the private network in such a way that it doesn't require administrator privileges on the machine?</p>  <p>The machines are running Windows 7, and the vagrant box is using Virtual Box with a Linux guest.</p>
