<p>I have extra router that I converted to switch wifi, Im able to do it but weird thing happened. </p>  <p>Anyway first let me describe the layout. </p>  <pre><code>Main Router -&gt; switch -&gt; dlink router  </code></pre>  <p><strong>In dlink router (i setup / changed the config to) :</strong></p>  <pre><code>lan ip to : 192.168.0.2 dhcp : disabled wifi : access point / keep default </code></pre>  <p><strong>Number of device connected to dlnk :</strong></p>  <pre><code>direct connect or via cable : 1 wifi : 3 all computers / laptops OS : win 7 </code></pre>  <p><strong>Issue :</strong> The 3rd device connected to the wifi <strong>can ping website</strong> but <strong>can't browse</strong> it to the browser. Im sure no issue with the 3rd device because when it is connected to other wifi or main wifi, it can do browsing.</p>
