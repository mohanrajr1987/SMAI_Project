<p>Trying to create a VM only network that the guests can use to speak to each other, but not the host. I want to isolate the host for security reasons, as multiple test users will be using the VMs. </p>  <p>Currently I have a fedora 22 box with multiple windows/fedora/freebsd guests. It has two network interfaces, one for the host and the second tied to a bridge called "bridge0"</p>  <pre><code># cat /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-bridge0 DEVICE="bridge0" ONBOOT="yes" TYPE=Bridge BOOTPROTO=static IPADDR=192.168.1.2 NETMASK=255.255.255.0  # cat /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-enp4s0f1 TYPE=Ethernet BOOTPROTO=static NAME=enp4s0f1 DEVICE=enp4s0f1 ONBOOT=yes NM_CONTROLLED=no BRIDGE=bridge0  # brctl show bridge name     bridge id               STP enabled     interfaces bridge0         8000.0010183803ce       no              enp4s0f1                                                         vnet0                                                         vnet1                                                         vnet2 virbr0          8000.5254000a60a5       yes             virbr0-nic </code></pre>  <p>Is this as simple as creating another bridge "bridge1" and not attaching a physical interface AND not assigning an ip address? </p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
