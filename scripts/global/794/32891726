<p>I need to add a long list of IPs to multiple WatchGuard XTM515 for a third party uptime service. I have created an alias in one of the firewalls and manually entered all the IPs. I wanted to export that alias and just import it into the next firewall, but I don't think that's possible. My next thought would be to import all the IPs from a CSV file, either into an alias or just straight into a policy. </p>  <p>Does anyone know if this is possible or a similar way to allow 40+ IPs through our firewalls for pings. </p>
