<p>I am attempting to interop with a custom hardware device. </p>  <p>It requires the first TCP packet to contain a data payload </p>  <p>I tried to achieve this using TcpClient in System.Net.Sockets</p>  <pre><code>   TcpClient tcpclnt = new TcpClient();    tcpclnt.Connect("192.168.1.11", 1500);    Stream stm = tcpclnt.GetStream();    byte[] ba = messagestr.StringToByteArray();                       stm.Write(ba, 0, ba.Length); </code></pre>  <p>However wireshark shows that this code sends a number of TCP/IP packets to establish a connection and the data packet (containing messagestr) is the 4-5th packet. </p>  <p>How can I make C# send the data in the FIRST TCP packet? </p>
