<p>I am trying to know if a process is running on a remote computer. But the default vb.net getprocess is showing network path not found error, i can connect and communicate with the PC through TCP and share stuff, how to get the processes? I am a beginner and don't know what is WMI and if possible full example of the thing i am trying to do, there is always a link of sorts and it is always in C# or something but my app is in vb.net.</p>
