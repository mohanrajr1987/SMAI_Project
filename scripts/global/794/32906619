<p>Can you suggest please SCTP traffic generator?  I tried iperf 3.1, SCTP doesn't works, also I tried special modified iperf1.6-lksctp doesn't work either. </p>  <p>All I need is just application that generates SCTP traffic to set destination. Also it will be good to set DSCP values.</p>  <p>I know that scapy allows to do it. But I have no time to go deep in scapy.</p>  <p>Please suggest SCTP packet/traffic generator.</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
