<p>I'm an amateur web developer that's trying to learn lower level networking concepts, and Python. In order to enhance my skills and knowledge, I want to write a simple Python program that allows me to "kick" people out of my network.</p>  <p>I got the inspiration to try and do such a thing from a program I had on my old Android cellphone, called "WifiKill". I found <a href="http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/21080/how-does-wifikill-actually-work">this post on SO</a>, in which the way that it does what it does is explained. </p>  <p>So far, I have a simple script that opens up a GUI and lists the devices and their local IP addresses on my network. I have no idea how to send these devices the ARP packets. I've read quite a bit on ARP, but so far I'm still not fully getting the concepts. </p>  <p>My question is, how do I even get started? I want to write all of this on my own, with nothing but the help of native modules. Would the <code>socket</code> module be of any help?</p>  <p>I guess that what I need help with here, specifically, is sending specially crafted "raw" packets to a device on my network. I have no networking code whatsoever, other than using the Windows <code>arp -a</code> command to fetch the devices. I'm not even sure if that's the next step to take, or if there's even something like being able to send raw packets with Python. I just want a hint in the right direction.</p>  <p>I'm on Windows, although ideally I'd like to make this work on Linux too. But I just want to get started on Windows.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
