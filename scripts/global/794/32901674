<p>I know how to adjust the adapter binding order in Windows so that LAN is preferred over wireless, and remote access connections are preferred over either.  The latter is very important when accessing resources over the VPN that have different addresses on the inside of the remote network than they do on the Internet.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/F9KgP.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/F9KgP.png" alt="Windows 10 adapter binding order dialog"></a></p>  <p>Unfortunately, when I change the order so the remote access connections are listed first and click OK, the change does not take effect, and is back in the other order when I check it again.  This works properly on Windows 7 and 8.</p>  <p>I've been looking for similar reports and a solution, but haven't found anything.  I suspect that this is a bug in Windows 10.</p>
