<p>I have recently been seeing unknown phones and computers in my Windows 10 Network (see FileExplorer.Network).  These most often show up after an F5 refresh of the window.  My network is WPA2 protected with MAC filtering.  These unknown devices have a MAC address, but the IP address is "Unavailable".  I am curious as to why Windows 10 shows them as part of my network.</p>  <p>Are there possible attacks at the MAC address level?  For example: if a device (device1) that IS allowed on the network were to send its MAC address to an attacker, could an attacking device (device2) then send MAC datagrams directly to device1?</p>
