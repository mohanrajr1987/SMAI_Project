<p>I am using angry ip scanner to find the open ports in my friends remote computer but I am unable to find any how to find it? I tried using different versions of angry ip scanner even tried online ports finder and even advanced ip scanner but unable to find any open ports. kindly help.  Is this error may be due to firewall (windows) or some network firewall is blocking  even i am unable to connect via telnet and FTP server?</p>
