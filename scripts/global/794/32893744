<p>I am looking for solution to create outdoor wifi local network with coverage about 2 sq.km and capacity about 1000 simualtenous connections. All access points will be connected to one web/stream server. Could you advise something, equipment, software? How much it will cost?  I thought about 4-5 Cisco Aironet 1530 series but it's expensive and I don't know what is will be coverage area? Thank you. </p>
