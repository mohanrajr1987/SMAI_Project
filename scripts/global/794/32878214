<p>I am software programmer. Just need to know is there a hardware solution to commutate or map 2 external socket connections on hardware level?</p>  <p>PeerA -----> Server &lt;------PeerB</p>  <p>A server hardware with setup parameter like @Port range@ which allows connection from one Peer to the Port in that range to be directly connected to established connection from another Peer to the same Port?</p>  <p>To map outcomming stream from PeerA to Peer B, and outcoming from PeerB to PeerA?</p>  <p>Programmatically it looks like 2 transit threads like <strong>Transit(SocketA, SocketB)</strong> and same, but with reverse order <strong>Transit(SocketB, SocketA)</strong>.</p>  <p>Is there the similar, but hardware solution, with API lib, where I could get that port range visible as a table, where FREE/BUSY marks let me select and assign ports to looking for mutual connection peers?</p>
