<p>I have searched all over for a good code for uploading an mp3 or similar file to a php server and have tested over 10 samples but none has been successful so far. Most codes I have checked out are either full of bugs or use outdated libraries.</p>  <p>I would appreciate if anyone has a truly working code sample. Possibly one that uses volley or a similar library. Would appreciate any help or some code that points me in the right direction.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
