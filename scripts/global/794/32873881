<p>I have created the networks and established the connection between those networks.I have made sure that the systems in the different networks are pinging to each other. I have turned of the windows firewall.I have created home groups too to make the networks private.I have used same routers and switches and made connections perfectly.When I create a sever and create a new game in NFS then I couldn't find the server I have created in the other system, I don't know why. I have tried everything I know. Please anyone help me with this.</p>
