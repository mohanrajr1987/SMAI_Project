<p>I have made a script that takes files from directory, and sends them to backburner for network rendering. When I run the script it renders fine but without the render elements they dont show in the backburner monitor nor do they save. If I open some of the files manualy and send them to render with backburner it works fine, but not with the script? The render element is VrayAlpha, but I dont think it matters.</p>
