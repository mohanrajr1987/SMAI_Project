<p>Is it possible to use my router as a VPN client to a Proxy Server?</p>  <p>Basically I have a web server that I'm already paying for. I'm hesitant to install OpenVPN on my web server because in this article:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.vpntutorials.com/tutorials/openvpn-sharing-a-port-with-a-webserver-on-port-80-443/" rel="nofollow">http://www.vpntutorials.com/tutorials/openvpn-sharing-a-port-with-a-webserver-on-port-80-443/</a></p>  <p>...it says that OpenVPN basically takes over port 80 then forwards HTTP requests to a different port. I'd really prefer to not mess with that if I can help it, since I've already got a lot happening on port 80. So I'm trying to get a working solution (if it's even possible) with router -> Squid proxy connection.</p>  <p>I've searched for answers to this, but I can't find any recent discussions. I've found these articles:</p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11029129/can-squid-run-behind-nginx">Can squid run behind nginx?</a></p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15696908/rewrite-nginx-host-and-proxypass-to-squid">Rewrite nginx host and proxypass to squid</a></p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19497620/nginx-doesnt-pass-request-uri-field-to-squid">Nginx doesn&#39;t pass Request-URI: field to SQUID</a></p>  <p>...which were helpful, but still couldn't give me a working solution.</p>  <p>Up to this point I've installed <a href="http://nginx.org/en/" rel="nofollow">NGINX</a> and <a href="http://www.squid-cache.org/" rel="nofollow">Squid</a>. NGINX is successfully routing my web traffic already. As for Squid, I've managed to configure my web browser to connect successfully with my server via Squid to handle proxy traffic, and I can browse the web just fine. But I want to do this at the network level via my router so I don't have to do this for all devices (multiple computers, tablets, phones, media streamers, etc.).</p>  <p>Currently, my NGINX file looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>#upstream _squid {     #server 127.0.0.1:3128;     #}  server {       listen xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:80;       listen [::]:80;       server_name sub.example.com;       location / {             proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;             proxy_set_header Host $host;             #proxy_pass http://_squid/$host$uri;             proxy_pass http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:3128;             proxy_redirect off;       }     } </code></pre>  <p>(x's represent my actual IP address) </p>  <p>I've tried to remove the comment hashes for the upstream section, and switching the proxy_pass statements, but both basically have the same effect. When I go to sub.example.com (my domain), it gives me this error:</p>  <pre><code>ERROR  The requested URL could not be retrieved  The following error was encountered while trying to retrieve the URL: /squid.trentpages.com/  Invalid URL  Some aspect of the requested URL is incorrect.  Some possible problems are:  Missing or incorrect access protocol (should be http:// or similar)  Missing hostname  Illegal double-escape in the URL-Path  Illegal character in hostname; underscores are not allowed. </code></pre>  <p>I'm guessing this is because I haven't passed in an actual URL - I went to the url that forwards to Squid, but there wasn't an actual URL request in the header (??). I would expect at this point that Squid would ask for my username and password, but it hasn't yet.</p>  <p>More importantly, I've tried every option I can think of in my router's (ASUS RT-N66W) VPN Client options without luck.</p>  <p>Am I chasing a unicorn here?</p>
