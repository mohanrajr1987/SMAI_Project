<p>IPFW dummynet tool generally filter network packet and set allow or deny rule by IP name. Most of the websites uses dynamic IP which periodically changes its IP address. How can i set deny or allow rules for websites by its domain name using IPFW from freeBSD? For example i set rules for www.facebook.com in IPFW, but it will converted by its IP.</p>  <p>c:\IPFW>ipfw add 1001 deny log IP from any to www.facebook.com</p>  <p>00102 deny log ip from any to 31.13.69.197 (Rule set by its IP in IPFW)</p>  <p>Or any other way i can accomplish it. </p>
