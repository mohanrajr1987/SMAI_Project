<p>im switching from zoidcom to raknet, for now I'm researching what I can do with it, and I can't find information on object relevance to connection, as far as I know I have to call <code>RakPeerInterface::Receive()</code> or <code>ReplicaManager3::Update()</code> and this will update all objects and send differences to all clients (in client/server setup). what if one player is far away from object and it doesn't need to receive updates on this object from server, is this possible?</p>  <p>Second problem with raknet that I see is it stores pointers to all objects internally and when I call update (which have to be called every game tick), it updates ALL objects, what if I have like thousands or millions of objects? Will raknet enumerate all of them and call their callbacks or is there way to manually call update on objects I think are relevant? Because I don't see the point of updating objects that are far away from all players, any way to combine this with some sort of quadtree?</p>
