<p>I have a server that successfully generates push notifications and sends them to devices. On the app side, if the user is already in the app or if the user enters the app from the notification I can easily 'find' the notification and run the necessary code to action the notification (app delegate gets invoked and the notification is stored in NSUserDefaults which I can then access throughout the app).</p>  <p>However, if the user has the app running in the background (for example, user was in the app, but then switched to another app), when the user reopens the app from the <strong>app icon</strong>, the app simply returns to the last state it was in and no code actually gets invoked (which is kind of what you expect).</p>  <p>What I am trying to figure out is how to either invoke AppDelegate again so that I can extract the notification <strong>before</strong> I return to the current state or how do I invoke  some code so that I can intercept the notification.</p>  <p>Thoughts?</p>
