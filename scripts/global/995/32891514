<p>I want to implement a plugin for <a href="http://www.gajim.org" rel="nofollow">gajim</a> to have native notifications on Windows 8/10 via <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.notifications.toastnotification.aspx" rel="nofollow">Toasts</a>. Are there any implementations for toasting notifications from python code? At the moment I am calling a powershell script, but that does not feel right.</p>
