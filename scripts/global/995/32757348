<p>I want my app to notify users of specific events that can occur at a certain time.</p>  <p>I know how to send a notification knowing the exact time of it, but things get a little complicated for me when I want to trigger notifications at times that are unknown at app install (notifications whose time can change or which depend on a specific event). </p>  <p><strong>Here are two cases in which I don't know how to trigger a notification :</strong></p>  <ul> <li><p>Send a notification every day at a time <strong>that can change from day to day</strong>. Say I want to notify users that it's sunrise time, do I need a Service to run permanetly an calculate for each day the time of sunset and trigger a notification when the time comes ?</p></li> <li><p>Send a notification everytime something new in the community occurs. I don't want to notify users of an update, but just of a particular event at a certain time. <strong>How do I send notifications to them</strong>?</p></li> </ul>  <p>How can I achieve this ?</p>  <p>Thanks !</p>
