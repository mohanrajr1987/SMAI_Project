<p>When my iOS app is in the background and i receive a notification, the notification banner is displayed. When I tap on the banner, the application comes into foreground. But when I open the notification bar, I find that my notification is still there. I know that there is a way to clear the notifications from the notifications bar (i.e. [[UIApplication sharedApplication] cancelAllLocalNotifications];) but that removes even the notifications that are never tapped. Is there a way to remove only one notification that was tapped from the notification banner?</p>
