<p>I understand that there is a very limited number of options to do with the Applescript notification alert call, but I am curious as to whether alerts can be called with icons or specified images to better identify them?</p>  <p>I ask this as i have seen it employed by other Applications which use the Notification Centre, and each Application has its notifications heralded by its own Application Icons. </p>  <p>Example:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/zRJ4A.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/zRJ4A.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Thanks in Advance.</p>
