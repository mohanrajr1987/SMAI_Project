<p>I found a script that does great. The only change I want to make is to list just the files, not the new folders. This script should monitor a folder and subfolders and notify only when a new file has been created. How can I filter this down to just the file? Can I add an exclude on the get-childitem?</p>  <pre><code>    Param (     [string]$Path = "\\path\share",     [string]$SMTPServer = "smtp server",     [string]$From = "email",     [string]$To = "email",     [string]$Subject = "New File(s) Received on the FTP site"     )  $SMTPMessage = @{     To = $To     From = $From     Subject = "$Subject at $Path"     Smtpserver = $SMTPServer }  $File = Get-ChildItem $Path | Where { $_.LastWriteTime -ge (Get-Date).Addminutes(-10) } If ($File) {   $SMTPBody = "`nTo view these new files, click the link(s) below:`n`n "     $File | ForEach { $SMTPBody += "$($_.FullName)`n" }     Send-MailMessage @SMTPMessage -Body $SMTPBody  } </code></pre>  <p>Thanks</p>
