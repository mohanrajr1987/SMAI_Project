<p>I'm very new to Android Wear (development). I started reading and implementing the <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/notifications/creating.html" rel="nofollow" title="documentation">documentation</a>. </p>  <p>However I'm not sure if what I want to implement is "Ã¼berhaupt" possible. I can attach custom "actions" on the push notifications I receive, but it seems it can only open a phone-activity. Why can't I open a wear-activity?</p>  <p>The push notifications contains text, which is initially displayed, and data about a soccer match (second page?). I want to display the names of the teams and the score without an intervention of the phone.</p>  <p>So is it possible?</p>  <p>Plus what is the default behaviour? Do I attach this to an action or via an extra page on the notification?</p>  <pre><code>NotificationCompat.Builder notificationBuilder =     new NotificationCompat.Builder(this)             .setSmallIcon(R.drawable.ic_stat_notification_icon3)             .setContentTitle(this.getString(R.string.notifications_title))             .setContentText(message)             .setStyle(new NotificationCompat.BigTextStyle().bigText(message))             .setContentIntent(matchDetailPendingIntent)             .setAutoCancel(true)             .extend(new NotificationCompat.WearableExtender()                             .addPage(CustomDesignedPage) //Is this possible?                             .addAction(action)                             .setBackground(BitmapFactory.decodeResource(getResources(), R.drawable.soccer_background_big))             ); </code></pre>  <h2>EDIT</h2>  <p>Looking at the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facebook.orca&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow" title="Messenger-wear">Messenger</a> wear-app it seems possible? <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/QakuE.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/QakuE.png" alt="Messenger Android Wear App "></a></p>  <p>The second screen shows a list of messages for example.</p>
