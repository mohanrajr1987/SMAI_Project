<p>I am using the <code>TNotificationCenter</code> to present a local Notification in my App. In Android, the component works well, but in iOS it does not, (It doesn't show the notification message). I have checked the value of <code>FMLocalNotificationPermission</code> to true, and the same problem. I have also tested the sample code of Embarcadero, and that does not show me the Notification mesagge.</p>  <p>Do you also happen to you ?</p>  <p>Here is the code:</p>  <pre><code>procedure TNotificationsForm.btnSendNotificationClick(      Sender: TObject); var   Notification: TNotification; begin   Notification := NotificationCenter.CreateNotification;   try     Notification.Name := 'Notification_'+IntToStr(contNotification);     contNotification := contNotification + 1;     Notification.AlertBody := 'Example';     Notification.FireDate := Now;     NotificationCenter.ScheduleNotification(Notification);     // NotificationCenter.PresentNotification(Notification); //I've also tried   finally     Notification.DisposeOf;   end; end; </code></pre>  <p>I am using Rad Studio Delphi 10 Seattle, on Ios 9. </p>
