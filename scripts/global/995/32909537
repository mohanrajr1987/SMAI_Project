<p>I have to implement a reminder - make the note, then store it in local DB and then make the notification when time comes. I have no experience in mobile development so I'm asking what's better - to implement some time manager that will invoke notifications instantly or store the notifications "as is" to let them be activated by themselves. What is good approach?</p>  <p>EDIT: I forgot to mention, that I use Xamarin and I've already implemented cross-platform notifications, but now the problem is to choose right way to store and handle them</p>
