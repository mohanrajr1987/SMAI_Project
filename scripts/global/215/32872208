<p>Each time after I deploy my code into IIS I keep getting the error "Missing type map configuration or unsupported mapping".</p>  <p>Once I restart IIS, the problem goes away, so I don't think it's my code. However, today, I am continuing to get this error. </p>  <p>The mapping error initially happened in one place and after restarting, it is now happening on different mappings, so it's not always the same place.</p>  <p>Is there anything with a release into IIS that would cause Automapper to use a previously "cached" assembly, which would explain why when I restart IIS it fixes itself?</p>  <p>I'm pretty stumped here.</p>
