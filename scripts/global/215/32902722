<p>For web application development using C#, IIS seems to be the standard choice of web server. But are there any other options? I want to even use Linux for my web server.</p>  <p>As far as I can see the other options are:</p>  <ol> <li><p>Make your web server program handle the IIS stuff yourself. (As long as you don't need a lot of IIS features, this won't be too expensive)</p></li> <li><p>Use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSP_(software)" rel="nofollow">XSP</a> </p></li> <li><p>Use Apache Tomcat with <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/docs/web/mod_mono/" rel="nofollow">mod_mono</a></p></li> <li><p>Use another web server like <a href="http://nginx.org/en/" rel="nofollow">nginx</a> or <a href="http://www.lighttpd.net/" rel="nofollow">lighttpd</a> (Is this even possible with C#?)</p></li> <li><p>Use that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Web_Interface_for_.NET" rel="nofollow">OWIN</a> stuff (Are there implementations of this which are mature enough to consider yet?)</p></li> <li><p>Something else I haven't considered ... ? </p></li> </ol>  <p>Which of these options is the most viable for a web application in the long term?</p>  <p>I'm mostly concerned about the long term maintainability of the project, rather than the server being able to handle high volume loads.</p>
