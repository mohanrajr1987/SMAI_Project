<p>I just published my mvc application on IIS server and its working correctly and i can access it through webbrowser. The problem is within same network i canlt access it from other host for which the server is visible. Error i receive when trying to access is saying:</p>  <pre><code>403 - Forbidden: Access is denied. You do not have permission to view this directory or page using the credentials that you supplied. </code></pre>  <p>P.S How to check what port was assigned to my web application and eventually how to change it?</p>
