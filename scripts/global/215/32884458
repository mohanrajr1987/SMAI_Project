<p>I am struggling hard from since last 2 days in fixing this issue. I have a website hosted in IIS 7.5 on azure virtual machine that has its endpoints defined to be accessed via a web browser. Website has 4.0 .Net framework and <code>mark logic</code> as back end.<br>  On clicking a button I am instantiating a process that basically loads some hundreds of XML documents in the mark logic database, but after a few minutes I am getting the page <code>The connection was reset</code>.<br> I have already increased the session timeout in App-pools, IIS and web.config respectively, also allowed the firewall to bypass the inetmgr and World Wide Web services. Please suggest some solutions, desperately need help.<br> Thank you.</p>
