<p>I have 2 web sites installed on the same IIS server. I need them both to listen on port 443 with HTTPS. I want them to use different application pools and be able to stop and start one without affecting the other. The clients of these websites are not able to configure the host header that they use in their HTTP requests.</p>  <p>Is there a solution? I have been trying to use IIS Rewrite rules. I have one website deployed on port 443 and the other on some unusual port. I tried setting up a URL rewrite on the first one that did a rewrite (not a redirect) to an absolute URL referencing the 2nd site on the unusual port. This always seems to produce an HTTP 404 response.</p>  <p>I can't do a redirect because the client gets redirected to the unusual port and the client is not allowed to make internet requests to non-standard ports.</p>  <p>I believe I am using IIS 6.2, that's what is says in the Help about in IIS MAnager</p>  <p>What options do I have?</p>
