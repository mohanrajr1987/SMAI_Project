<p>My Azure web app (App Service) writes a log file <code>mywebapp.log</code> to the d:\LogFiles directory of the VM that hosts the website.  When the log file gets to a certain size I rename it to <code>mywebapp1.log</code>, <code>mywebapp2.log</code>, and so on so and a new log file is created.  (I do this manually - stop the website, rename the file and restart the site.)</p>  <p>One day I inspected the directory through the Kudu (SCM) portal and saw just a lone <code>mywebapp.log</code> that was much larger than normal.  The file included all of the individual logs that previously existed (included the contents of <code>mywebapp1.log</code> + <code>mywebapp2.log</code> and so on).</p>  <p>My app has no which combines the files.  Is there an Azure process that does this or did I do it in my sleep and have no recollection?</p>
