<p>I'm new to DASH technology. I need a streaming via HTTP of mp3 audio files from an IIS Web server that will be used by web applications with HTML5 tag , no video. To implement the DASH I know I have not special needs / configurations on the web server, but only the creation of files mpd. correct? Can it streams .mp3 files ?</p>  <p>I read that the easiest way to generate a file mpd is <a href="https://gpac.wp.mines-telecom.fr/mp4box/" rel="nofollow">https://gpac.wp.mines-telecom.fr/mp4box/</a> but could not find a version already compiled for Windows.</p>
