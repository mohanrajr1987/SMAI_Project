<p>I was asked to make some modifications on a website that is hosted on an iis7 server. I was given the DNS address and a password (I'm guessing I need a username also..) but I have no idea how to connect to the server to even see the files (after that I know how to make the necessary changes).</p>  <p>Is there a manual on how to do this (I'm guessing it's pretty simple). Do I need special software?</p>
