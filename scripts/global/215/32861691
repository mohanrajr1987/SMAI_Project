<p>In IIS, I have a website ("MyWebsite").</p>  <p>In this website, I have several applications ("MyWebsiteAppV1", "MyWebsiteAppV2" "MyWebsiteAppV3")</p>  <p>So the URL to access an application is like "<a href="http://localhost/MyWebsiteAppV1/" rel="nofollow">http://localhost/MyWebsiteAppV1/</a>"</p>  <p>I would like to add add an URL that correspond to the last version of my application (MyWebsiteAppV3) like "<a href="http://localhost/MyWebsiteAppLastVersion/" rel="nofollow">http://localhost/MyWebsiteAppLastVersion/</a>".</p>  <p>For Now, I simply added a virtual directory that use the same folder than "MyWebsiteAppV3", but I think that this is not a good solution.</p>  <p>How can I do it ? It should not be a redirection, so I think I must use Url rewriting but I didn't manage to get it work.</p>
