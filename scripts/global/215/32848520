<p>As of <a href="https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/69" rel="nofollow">ASP.NET Announcement 69</a>:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>"ASP.NET 5 applications run in IIS have been hosted by a component named Helios" and In beta8, we're discontinuing the "Helios" IIS host..</p> </blockquote>  <p>Also:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Hosting ASP.NET 5 applications in IIS will now be achieved using the IIS HttpPlatformHandler configured to forward through to the ASP.NET 5 Kestrel server. This native IIS module, manages the launching of an external application host process (in this case dnx.exe) and the routing of requests from IIS to the hosted process.</p> </blockquote>  <p>The problem I have right now is that I've spent a few days stumbling through the internet looking how to host DNX application with <code>HttpPlatformHandler</code> in Azure and achieved nothing working.</p>  <p>Can anyone point me to a sample, tutorial or simply the direction I need to be taking?</p>
