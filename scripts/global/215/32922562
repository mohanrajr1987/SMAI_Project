<p>I want to run my asp.net 6 (beta7) application in Visual Studio 2015 on specific domain, mydomain.com for example. How could It be achieved?</p>  <p>Hosting the published version would lose the Visual Studio debuging. Built in IISExpress launch profile do net let domain address change, just port number of localhost address.</p>  <p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I've solved the problem with self-host, Microsoft.AspNet.Server.WebListener, but there is a way to do that with Windows IIS 8.5?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
