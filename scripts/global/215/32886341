<p>We have an Asp.net MVC application that has several dropdown lists on an input form. </p>  <p>We populate the lists as below:</p>  <pre><code>@Html.DropDownListFor(model =&gt; model.Title, SelectLists.Title)  public class SelectLists     {         public static IEnumerable&lt;SelectListItem&gt; Title = new[]         {             new SelectListItem {Text = "Title", Value = "", Selected = true},             new SelectListItem {Text = "Mr", Value = "Mr"},             new SelectListItem {Text = "Mrs", Value = "Mrs"},             new SelectListItem {Text = "Miss", Value = "Miss"},             new SelectListItem {Text = "Ms", Value = "Ms"},             new SelectListItem {Text = "Dr", Value = "Dr"}         };     } </code></pre>  <p>The default selected value is correct straight after a deploy onto our production environment but after time, what seems to happen, is that for all dropdowns, random values start to get selected on page load.</p>  <p>When we inspect the element on the form the <code>selected="selected"</code> attribute is set on the incorrectly displayed value on the offending dropdowns.</p>  <p>When we re-deploy the application the issues seems to temporarily go away, this is leading us to believe it could be an issue with IIS?</p>  <p>The application is running on IIS on a windows server 2012 on AWS Elastic Beanstalk. </p>
