<p>I'm running a Wordpress site and I changed a .php file which creates the email for a contact form. I'm running this with IIS on Windows 2012 R2 with PHP 5.6 as FastCGI module.</p>  <p>What I already tried. - Clear the client/browser cache (but as far as I know php is serverside) - Disable IIS Output caching completly - Disable IIS Output caching for .php file - Restarted the server - Restarted the website in IIS Manager - Renamed the file locally - Reuploaded the file via FTP - Disabled wincache extension in php.ini - Cleared Windows temp dir - Cleared IIS temp dir - Checked the dir which serves the content (that I don't change a possible duplicate)</p>  <p>I changed the header and message of the generated email, and when I send a mail using the contact form I also received the messages with the correct content but not with the updated header and message-formatting.</p>  <p>Currently I don't have any idea what else I should try or how to solve the problem. I mean currently it's only one file, but what if I have to do a wordpress update. Somehow it is cached or a preloaded state is saved somewhere but I don't know where.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
