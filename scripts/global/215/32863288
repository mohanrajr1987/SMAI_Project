<p>I have my web app I'm developing under local IIS (so not not the visual studio embedded one). It works fine, I can go from page to page... </p>  <p>But if I then change the code and recompile, IIS stops responding properly for ~2 minutes. If I attach the debugger, then there's no executing code, but it just won't serve any pages.</p>  <p>If I stop the App Pool in IIS, then I get a 503 error instantly, but I then am prevented from restarting the App Pool for ~2 minutes with error: Cannot Start Application Pool / There was an error while performing this operation. / Details: / The service cannot accept control messages at this time. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80070425)</p>  <p>As you can imagine, this is crippling my productivity. Only started happening a couple of days ago, I haven't made any changes to the code which I would have though would cause this problem... and it doesn't matter which page I touch and recompile anyway, it takes just as long to recover. Nothing in the event log. </p>  <p>Any clues as to where to start looking?</p>
