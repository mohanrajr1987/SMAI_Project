<p>I debug a site on the local IIS (localhost).</p>  <p>I use a tool (<em>Gulp</em>) to generate minified JS files directly from "dev" to the "dist" folder that is used by the server.</p>  <p><em>Gulp</em> watches the <code>dev/my.js</code> file and once modified genetates the </p>  <pre><code>dist/my.min.js dist/maps/my.min.js.map </code></pre>  <p>This <em>should permit</em> to see directly the modifications on the server, without rebuilding/redeploying the entire site, there is need just to refresh the page...</p>  <p>The problem is the generated <code>map</code> file.. The local IIS thinks that this is a binary file change, and restarts/recycle the server once binary files are changed... </p>  <p>So in order to see my change is JavaScript I need to wait until the local server is refreshed (so it removes any advantage of generating files with GULP)...</p>  <p>Is there a way to say to IIS do NOT recycle itself when <code>.map</code> files are changed?</p>  <p>Hopefully for the <code>.css</code> files the trik works, because there is no map files associated with the <code>.min.css</code> files</p>
