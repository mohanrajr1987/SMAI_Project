<p>So I am trying to catch a particular url using a wildcard match in IIS 8.5 with the UrlRewrite tool.</p>  <p>The url I am trying to match is of this format:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><a href="http://www.somesite.com/%20-%20/here/is/the/rest/of/the/url" rel="nofollow">http://www.somesite.com/%20-%20/here/is/the/rest/of/the/url</a></p> </blockquote>  <p>These urls are coming out of Excel and Word, it is replacing the # in our angularJS urls with ' - '.</p>  <p>The rule I have is as follows:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;rule name="Catch spaces and dashes" patternSyntax="Wildcard" stopProcessing="true"&gt;     &lt;match url="*" /&gt;     &lt;conditions logicalGrouping="MatchAll" trackAllCaptures="false" /&gt;     &lt;action type="Redirect" url="http://google.co.uk" /&gt; &lt;/rule&gt; </code></pre>  <p>However, in IIS all I am receiving is a 404, can someone explain why this rule is not being hit?</p>  <p>Is there any way I can get it so this rule does get hit?</p>
