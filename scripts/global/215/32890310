<p>I was testing <a href="http://www.cardsengifts.nl/" rel="nofollow">this site</a> and noticed some strange behavior.</p>  <p>When I go to <a href="http://www.cardsengifts.nl/something" rel="nofollow">http://www.cardsengifts.nl/something</a> I get a good looking error page that tells me that the page doesn't exist.</p>  <p>But if I go to <a href="http://www.cardsengifts.nl/something.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cardsengifts.nl/something.html</a> I get a different page, which I can't seem to find on the server.</p>  <p>Unfortunately I have not a lot of knowledge on IIS, so after some searching I just couldn't wrap my head around how these two link sends to different pages.</p>  <p>How can I manage the redirects on errors (404) in IIS? Where can I find the error page <a href="http://www.cardsengifts.nl/something.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cardsengifts.nl/something.html</a> directs me to?</p>
