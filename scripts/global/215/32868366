<p>I have hosted my website in 2 different servers. Of course their URL's are different, having different Port / IP Address. I have tagged and used my SSL in one website / server which is working fine. Also I have hosted same website in another server. Now I am getting issues in my new server URL of <strong>UNTRUSTED SITE. DO YOU WANT TO CONTINUE?</strong>. Can I use or map or tag my existing SSL into my this new URL / Server in which I have hosted my website.? If No. Then What if i host my website in same server and their IP Address and Port Numbers are same ?</p>
