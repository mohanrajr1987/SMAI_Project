<p>I've successfully installed Team City 9.1.3 on a Win2k12 R2 server. I can get to TC by going to <a href="http://localhost:8080" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8080</a> - all works as it should and no issues.</p>  <p>However, I would like to access TC from any browser within my company. I don't want to remote desktop just to get to TC, so I followed the instructions <a href="https://blogs.endjin.com/2010/11/a-step-by-step-guide-to-hosting-teamcity-in-iis-7/" rel="nofollow">Here</a>, but I cannot get to TC through my domain. My domain is <a href="http://teamcity" rel="nofollow">http://teamcity</a> and is bound to a 10.* ip address since I don't want it public. I do get a reply when I ping "teamcity." Should it be a public ip?</p>  <p>The server is a fresh VM I created yesterday and there are no other sites on it. The server is on the domain and I can remote desktop into it. </p>  <p>Is there anything I need to do to associate <a href="http://teamcity" rel="nofollow">http://teamcity</a> or the ip address with the server?</p>  <p>As a test, I associated the default web site in iis with the new domain and ip address. If I navigate to either the ip address or the domain in a browser on the server, it does not take me to the default web site. Nor does that work if I do the same from my desktop.</p>  <p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>  <p><strong>Update:</strong> Sys Admin fixed the issue. The ip was not bound to the server. As soon as he fixed that issue, everything is working as it should now.</p>
