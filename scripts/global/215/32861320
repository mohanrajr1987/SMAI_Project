<p>I have a problem which is similar to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31063048/azures-inbuild-website-authorization-throws-permission-error-after-returning-to#">this one</a>, but not quite.</p>  <p>We have a solution with two Azure Web Apps, built and deployed by Visual Studio Online. It has been working just fine for a few months, but suddenly all requests end in a 401.72 response:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>HTTP Error 401.71 - Unauthorized You do not have permission to view   this directory or page.</p>      <p>Most likely causes: The authenticated user does not have access to a   resource needed to process the request.</p>      <p>Things you can try: Create a tracing rule to track failed requests for   this HTTP status code. For more information about creating a tracing   rule for failed requests, click here.</p>      <p>Detailed Error Information: Module       EasyAuthModule_32bit   Notification     AuthenticateRequest Handler<br>   ExtensionlessUrlHandler-Integrated-4.0 Error Code    0x80004005   Requested URL    <a href="https://[appname]:80/" rel="nofollow">https://[appname]:80/</a> Physical Path<br>   D:\home\site\wwwroot Logon Method    Not yet determined Logon User<br>   Not yet determined</p>      <p>More Information: This is the generic Access Denied error returned by   IIS. Typically, there is a substatus code associated with this error   that describes why the server denied the request. Check the IIS Log   file to determine whether a substatus code is associated with this   failure.
