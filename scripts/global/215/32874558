<p>I have set everything up in SQL Server to access a FileTable using UNC share. I can verify this, since I can manually access the share and manipulate the files contained in it. I have also confirmed that other applications have access to the share. </p>  <p>The only application which doesn't seem to be able to access it under any circumstances is IIS. I have set a virtual directory up which points to the share. However, even if I use the GUI to change the virtual directory's settings, IIS complains that it can't access the share (specifically, it complains about being unable to access the web.config file). If I try to access the virtual directory from a remote client, IIS returns an HTTP 500 error which I assume has to do with being unable to access the web.config file.</p>  <p>I have searched for questions relating to IIS and UNC, and they all say that you should provide read access to IIS's account. However, since my share is an SQL Server FileTable, I can't exactly grant access like you would with a normal share. Also, I have verified that IIS's account has access to the SQL Server instance and Database where the FileTable is (it's in the same database that the entire website is using without any problems).</p>  <p>I'd really appreciate any ideas as to how I can make this work. Thanks in advance.</p>
