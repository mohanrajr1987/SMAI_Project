<p>I am on Windows 7 and logged in with a different domain\username than I am trying to use for my IIS application pool.  </p>  <p>I am unable to set my application pool identity to a custom account.  The error I get is:</p>  <p><code>The specified password is invalid.  Please type a new password.</code></p>  <p>The domain\username and password works fine in a remote desktop connection and I am able to connect to databases using <code>runas /netonly /user:domain\username ssms</code> command, so I know the username and password is good.</p>  <p>Why is IIS (IIS 7) specifically rejecting the account when it's otherwise good?  How would I troubleshoot this?</p>  <p>Note that I cannot browse the domain in question in Control Panel->User Accounts.  I <em>can</em> find it in Computer->Network->Search Active Directory.</p>
