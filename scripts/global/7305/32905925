<p>Is there way How can I get selected item from DateChooser calendar and how to change one specific dayCell? My goal is to create dialog after I'll double click on dayCell, that's not the problem, but after I'll do some actions in called dialog, like creating some entry for that day etc. I need to change the dayCell I've double clicked before, for example add small image to TOP_RIGHT of the dayCell. I need simply match dayCell for the specific day with specific entry, for example I'll click na 2.10.2015, it'll open new window with dialog and in this window I'll choose match this day with running, I'll click confirm and the dayCell I clicked before would update and it would display date number and small image of running man. So I need to get selected item and update only this selected item which is dayCell. </p>
