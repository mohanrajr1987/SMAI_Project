<p>I'm trying to implement a jquery datepicker showing the current and the last month.</p>  <p>However when selecting a date from last month (or when opening the datepicker with a selected date range from last month) it is "offsetting" with the last month and showing the non-selectable month before the last month and not the selectable current month.</p>  <p>My configuration is like this:</p>  <pre><code>    $('#dateselect').datepick({        rangeSelect: true,        monthsToShow: 2,       monthsOffset: 1,       changeMonth: false,       showOtherMonths: true,       selectOtherMonths: true,       minDate: '-2w',       maxDate: '+2w'}); </code></pre>  <p>What is the best way to set the defaultDate or Offset onShow and onSelect so that the datepicker is showing last and current month independently of selected date or date range ?</p>
