<p>I'm using the Bootstrap Date Range Picker (<a href="http://www.daterangepicker.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.daterangepicker.com/</a>).  Overall the plugin works great, however I do have one question that i'm hoping to find the answer to.</p>  <p>The input field that contains the date range picker sits within a bootstrap dropdown.  Therefore, the user has to click the dropdown to view the date range picker.</p>  <p>When the user clicks into the input field to select the date, the date range picker appears.  However, it doesn't generate the HTML that shows the picker within the dropdown DIV like I want it to.  It generates the HTML at the bottom of the page.  I'd like to <strong>move this generated HTML to the dropdown DIV</strong>.</p>  <p>In can view the generated HTML within the daterangepicker.js, but i'm not sure if this could be changed.</p>  <p>Thanks for the help!</p>  <p>-Adam</p>
