<p>I get String a and b and check if b contains the exact characters of a. For example: "ABBA" and "BAAAAA" returns false, "ABBA" and "ABABAB" returns true. I'm made a into and array with each String value and check if b contains that value, removing the value if it does so it doesn't find it twice. </p>  <p>However, the method is too slow, apparently on 12 seconds for some big strings. I've been trying but I haven't found a faster solution. Please help me out if you can!</p>  <pre><code>public static boolean inneholdt(String a, String b) {     int k = 0;     String[] Inn = a.split("(?!^)");      for (int i = 0; i &lt; Inn.length; i++)     {         if(b.contains(Inn[i]))         {             b = b.replaceFirst(Inn[i], "");              k++;         }     }      if(k &gt;= Inn.length)     {         return true;     } else return false; } </code></pre>
