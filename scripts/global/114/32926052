<p>I have the following Json response: </p>  <pre><code>[ {     "Year": 2016,     "Links": [ {         "Href": "/v1/Information/YMME/Years/2016/Makes",         "Rel": "VehicleMakes"       } ]   },   {     "Year": 2015,     "Links": [ {         "Href": "/v1/Information/YMME/Years/2015/Makes",         "Rel": "VehicleMakes"       } ]   },   {     "Year": 2014,     "Links": [ {         "Href": "/v1/Information/YMME/Years/2014/Makes",         "Rel": "VehicleMakes"       } ]   },   {     "Year": 2013,     "Links": [ {         "Href": "/v1/Information/YMME/Years/2013/Makes",         "Rel": "VehicleMakes"       } ]   },   {     "Year": 2012,     "Links": [ {         "Href": "/v1/Information/YMME/Years/2012/Makes",         "Rel": "VehicleMakes"       } ]   } ] </code></pre>  <p>As you can see is an Array of nested hashes. I know that there are several post on this but either my skill level or the uniqness of this issue I want to be able to manipulate this data. What method can help me to take this data into a Selectbox so that only the year shows up. So far in my view this is what I have and is only placing the complete object in the select box. I only want to see the year. </p>  <pre><code>    &lt;%=select_tag("Year", options_for_select(@caryears))%&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Where <code>@caryears</code> is the complete Array of hashes or (Objects). By the way I can't use symbols based on the response that is the way I get the data. The idea is to go to the Year link after the person selects the year</p>
