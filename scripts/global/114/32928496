<p>I would like to print something like this once I have my array finished:</p>  <p>Leg_______Departure Time_______Origin_____Destination________Travel Time</p>  <p>1..................(time).............................(place).........(place)........................(time)</p>  <p>2..................(time).............................(place).........(place)........................(time)</p>  <p>3..................(time).............................(place).........(place)........................(time)</p>  <p>I want to print out the array with automatically assigned numeric values based on the order that the user inputs the array item. I have a good idea on how to print out the array objects (time, places) but I do not know how to print out the reference number that would correspond. How would I go about making these numbers? (the dots are just placeholders and shouldnt appear in code. Id like to just float it in columns. SO doesnt let me place empty paces)</p>  <p>I thought I could ask the user for a location and track that item to a reference and add that reference to the the array, but that makes the numeric order static and I want them in order. Any help would be well appreciated. Thank you.</p>
