<p>I need to do something like this in the fastest way possible (O(1) would be perfect):</p>  <pre><code>for (int j = 0; j &lt; V; ++j)         {             if(!visited[j]) required[j]=0;         } </code></pre>  <p>I came up with this solution:</p>  <pre><code>for (int j = 0; j &lt; V; ++j)         {              required[j]=visited[j]&amp;required[j];         } </code></pre>  <p>Which made the program run 3 times faster but I believe there is an even better way to do this. Am I right?</p>  <p>Btw. required and visited are dynamically allocated arrays </p>  <pre><code>bool *required; bool *visited; required = new bool[V]; visited = new bool[V]; </code></pre>
