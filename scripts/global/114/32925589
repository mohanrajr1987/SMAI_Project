<p>I have two arrays</p>  <pre><code>let toBeFiltered = ["star0", "star2", "star1", "star0", "star3", "star4"] let theFilter = ["star1", "star3"] </code></pre>  <p>How to filter the first array using the second array? Actually the <code>theFilter</code> can be changed dynamically, e.g,</p>  <pre><code>let theFilter = ["star2"] or maybe let theFilter = ["star0", "star4", "star2"] </code></pre>  <p>Thanks for your help :)</p>
