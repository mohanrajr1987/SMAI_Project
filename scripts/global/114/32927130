<p>I have a set of correct combinations like following</p>  <pre><code>[["dbc", "dbs", "dbt"], ["dyc", "dys", "dyt"], ["drc", "drs", "drt"]] </code></pre>  <p>and was hoping to see if my combinations contain any of correct combination when my combinations are </p>  <pre><code>[["drs", "gbc", "lrs"], ["grt", "lbc", "lbt"], ["drc", "drs", "drt"], ["dyc", "dys", "dyt"]] </code></pre>  <p>If there are any matches, then print out correct combination.</p>  <p>I've tested .contains, but I guess it only works with finding one element in one-dimensional array. How can I check if multi-dimensional array contains specific arrays?</p>
