<p>I m developing a Java web application on a Tomcat server which would be deployed in various instances. Application has login and authorization in it. Login is done via Ldap and authorization is done via security realm. </p>  <p>Now I need to maintain the session. I dont want to maintain sticky session. Is it possible to use Oauth2 for session management for my application. If so, how can I achieve it? Kindly help me in this.  Thanks in advance.</p>
