<p>Which are the possible values of port numbers we can give for Tomcat in Eclipse ? I know that port numbers are ranging from 0-65535, as shown <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers" rel="nofollow">here</a>, but is there any <strong>preferred range</strong>? Should it consist of 4 digits?</p>  <p>Also, when changing those port numbers in Eclipse, why don't we need to change the port number in Tomcat's <code>server.xml</code> file too?</p>
