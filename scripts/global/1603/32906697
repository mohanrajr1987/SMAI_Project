<p>I am struggling with realms in Tomcat 7. And after hours of digging, <em>stackoverflow</em> is the my last chance to find a sollution or an answer ,)</p>  <p>Let's say I have two applications with their own definitions of <code>org.apache.catalina.realm.DataSourceRealm</code> with different parameters (<code>digest</code>, <code>userTable</code> and so on) defined within <code>app/META-INF/context.xml</code> file. Both applications are deployed within the same <code>Host</code>.</p>  <p>My "problem" is that both applications share the one realm (the one which is being instantiated as the first one). I was not able to find anything about instantiation of realms in Tomcat's documentation. Is it even possible to tell Tomcat to create singleton instance of the realm defined within <code>Context</code> element? Or just Tomcat striclty creates singleton instances (one per realm's <code>className</code>) for entire <code>Host</code>/<code>Engine</code> no matter where they are defined?</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
