<p>I've built a java program that logs into a game server and asks the user for an input ID and then sends a packer to the game server and parses and prints out the reply.</p>  <p>I need to convert this into an API that will be run on Tomcat I assume? I've installed Tomcat on my server but I am not sure what to do now and what the correct way to convert this would be.</p>  <p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. </p>
