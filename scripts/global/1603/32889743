<p>I have a java web application which is being served by apache tomcat on port 8080. We have instructed nginx to serve the application based on following configuration:</p>  <pre><code>location ~ ^/conference/(.*)$ {     proxy_set_header Host $host;     proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;     proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080/$1; } </code></pre>  <p>As you can see there should be a 'conference' keyword present in URL of all requests destined for this application.</p>  <p>We have made use of JDBCRealm for authentication purposes. So lets say I have entered '<a href="http://example.com/conference/conferencearchive" rel="nofollow">http://example.com/conference/conferencearchive</a>' in the address bar. After entering a valid username and matching password in the login form, I would expect to be redirected to the page I asked for but instead I'll get a redirection to '<a href="http://example.com/conferencearchive/" rel="nofollow">http://example.com/conferencearchive/</a>'.</p>  <p>What happens to the 'conference' part of the url?</p>
