<p>I have a jsp application witch has some css and javascript stuffs. The problem is that when I run this application on my local tomcat(localhost) is works just fine with all browsers(IE,Firefox,Chrome).But when I put it on a real server it doesn't work anymore with IE.</p>  <p>The real server is an https one,but I think that is not an issue.</p>  <p>Does anyone now what is the problem ?</p>
