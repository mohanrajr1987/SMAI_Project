<p>I just finished the upload process of files in my JSF web app. I would like to know :</p>  <p><strong>-</strong> How a temps file is cleared from files, when and by who ?</p>  <p><strong>-</strong> How to do a simply file copy from Temp folder to my uploads folder.</p>  <p><strong>The context :</strong></p>  <p>I'm using a Java code to upload a file to server uploads path, and all works great. This happens when a new user is subscribing, but, what if he uploads and change uploaded file before registration ? What if the user cancels the registration ? </p>  <p>For that, I made a little var holding uploaded file, to which I'm going to applu to copy(from Temp, to Uploads) that I'm asking about. The copy is performed on user submit button.</p>
