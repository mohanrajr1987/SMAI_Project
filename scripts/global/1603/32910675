<p>I am running atom on my machine and am trying to do drag and drop between atom and an iframe I have being served up by tomcat on my machine.  However I am running into CORS issues since the node server in atom has a <code>location.origin</code> of <code>file://</code> and my iframe is <code>http://localhost:8080</code>  how can I make it so that tomcat sets the location as <code>file://</code> or how can can proxy requests to a specific URL with it appearing as <code>file://</code></p>
