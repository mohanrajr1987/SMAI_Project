<p>I'm trying to wrap my brain around setting up load testing secure azure web applications. I want to push a load test to the cloud, which is pretty simple given we are using VS online. However, when running multiple users I get several errors. I think the errors revolve around a single account trying to gain authorization to web app simulated with multiple 'virtual users.' </p>  <p><strong>Errors:</strong> <a href="https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/login----" rel="nofollow">https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/login----</a>{POST} Context parameter $HIDDEN1.ctx not found in test context</p>  <p><a href="https://mysite.azurewebsites.net/----" rel="nofollow">https://mysite.azurewebsites.net/----</a>{POST} Context parameter $HIDDEN1.code not found in test context</p>  <p><strong>a slew of socket exceptions:</strong> <a href="https://localhost:port/skypetoc/v1/pnr/parse----" rel="nofollow">https://localhost:port/skypetoc/v1/pnr/parse----</a>{POST} connection actively refused</p>  <p><strong>ValidateResponseUrl errors</strong> <a href="https://mysite.azurewebsites.net/----" rel="nofollow">https://mysite.azurewebsites.net/----</a>{GET} The value of the expectedresponseUrl property '<a href="https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/authorize" rel="nofollow">https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/authorize</a> does not equal the actual response url <a href="https://mysite.azurewebsites.net" rel="nofollow">https://mysite.azurewebsites.net</a> querystring parameters were ignored. </p>  <p>running this test locally with a single user account works fine. pushing to the cloud under a single login account with multiple simulated users yields all these errors. </p>  <p><strong>Questions</strong>: <strong>1.</strong> Do I need to create n number of user accounts for this to work properly? <strong>2.</strong> Do I just need to create custom plugins at the request level to get new auth tokens per user request? <strong>3.</strong> Is there any built in support for this kind of stuff in Visual Studio Online Azure load testing?</p>  <p>I really don't want to test the performance of login since its out of my hands. but I do want to test the performance of my web app under load for other functions. </p>
