<p>I have been following the tutorials on the following URL to build myself a custom OAuth 2 Authorization Server.</p>  <p><a href="http://bitoftech.net/2014/06/01/token-based-authentication-asp-net-web-api-2-owin-asp-net-identity/" rel="nofollow">http://bitoftech.net/2014/06/01/token-based-authentication-asp-net-web-api-2-owin-asp-net-identity/</a></p>  <p>After a bit of work I now have my service up and running that I can register new users and then request a token from the service after providing the registered users credentials :)</p>  <p>The next part of the exercise I am undertaking is creating a MVC5 Web Application that can use my service for Authorization.</p>  <p>Can anyone point me in the direction of a simple tutorial that goes through this as I am in the process of banging my head off the wall with this now.</p>  <p>I have managed to request the token manually and store it in local cookie but this does not seem to allow be to do simple things like display the users name on the Views for example using @User.Identity.Name.</p>  <p>Any help/directions would be most appreciated as I am sure to be missing something obvious.</p>
