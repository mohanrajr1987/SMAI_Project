<p>I have R&amp;D for google fit rest API. I have setup project at console part and check out some queries regarding height, weight, steps count, heart bit etc with help of <strong>oauthplayground</strong>.  But I want some special case of queries. I have read about activity type, segment etc in developer guideline. All possible type of activity are <a href="https://developers.google.com/fit/rest/v1/reference/activity-types?hl=en" rel="nofollow">https://developers.google.com/fit/rest/v1/reference/activity-types?hl=en</a> I want individual activity records over particular time period. As per google guideLine I can get all activity data over particular time period (I can't fire query for single Activity for eg. I want Baseball(11) step count or any individual activity then I can't fire any single query which give activity records. Let me correct If I am wrong).  Now I am planning to implement this solution in different way</p>  <p>1) I will fire Query for segment on <strong>oauthplayground</strong>  <a href="https://www.googleapis.com/fitness/v1/users/me/dataSources/derived:com.google.activity.segment:com.google.android.gms:merge_activity_segments/datasets/0-1443354266000000000" rel="nofollow">https://www.googleapis.com/fitness/v1/users/me/dataSources/derived:com.google.activity.segment:com.google.android.gms:merge_activity_segments/datasets/0-1443354266000000000</a> which gives me list of all activity over time period  <br><strong>Out Put</strong><br></p>  <pre><code>modifiedTimeMillis": "1442576308378",        "startTimeNanos": "1441089000000000000",        "endTimeNanos": "1441092000000000000",        "value": [         {           "intVal": 8         }       ],  </code></pre>  <p>2) Based on the intVal '8' of the datapoint, I know that this is a 'running' type activity. I also know the 'from time' and 'to time' of the activity from startTimeNanos and endTimeNanos. The above data-point also gives us the 'date added' value from the  modifiedTimeMillis.Now, I grab the startTimeNanos and the endTimeNanos from the above data-point to obtain the run-distance, steps taken and the calories expended during the activity. Now Its fine. to get individual activity steps count calories etc. Query for steps count between time period.</p>  <pre><code>https://www.googleapis.com/fitness/v1/users/me/dataSources/derived:com.google.step_count.delta:com.google.android.gms:estimated_steps/datasets/1441089000000000000-1441092000000000000</code></pre>  <p><strong>Out Put</strong></p>  <pre><code>{   "minStartTimeNs": "1441089000000000000",    "maxEndTimeNs": "1441092000000000000",    "dataSourceId": "derived:com.google.step_count.delta:com.google.android.gms:estimated_steps",    "point": [     {       "modifiedTimeMillis": "1442576308566",        "startTimeNanos": "1441089000000000000",        "endTimeNanos": "1441092000000000000",        "value": [         {           "intVal": 55         }       ],        "dataTypeName": "com.google.step_count.delta",        "originDataSourceId": "raw:com.google.step_count.delta:com.google.android.apps.fitness:LAVA:PixelV1:72fa819f:user_input"     }   ] } </code></pre>  <p><strong>Let me suggest any good idea. If this process is wrong.</strong><br> <strong>Now I want Last Added,Edited,Delete(Hidden) data</strong> I mean Query Over  <strong>"modifiedTimeMillis": "1442576308566"</strong>  time Is it possible?<br> Is there any particular query which gives me Last Added record? Please give me any suggestions or instructions. I have one more question, every API or any record have one unique Identity I mean Some Id/GUID etc which is unique all over. In google fit API I can't get this identity. Let me suggest any query which gives me this ID.  <br>Thanks in Advance.</p>
