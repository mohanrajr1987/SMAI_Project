<p>I am developing a native application that should access the Azure tenant of the customer that is logging in (like the Azure PowerShell signin experience).  I tried to use Azure PowerShell's client id, but the refresh token to renew the credentials seems to be valid for 12 hours only. Afterwords, the user had to sign in again. </p>  <p>I tried to create a multi-tenant Azure AAD application, but multi-tenancy is not available for native AAD applications. How can I get a client id similar to PowerShell AAD client ID 1950a258-227b-4e31-a9cf-717495945fc2 that allows me to use the Azure Service Management API of the user loggin in (who is not in my Azure AD). </p>
