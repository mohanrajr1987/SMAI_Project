<p>I'm trying to implements OAUTH2 for a web applciation and need a simple OAUTH2 setup to secure rest APIs. One of the rest APIs provides login functionality where in it validates user credentails(username/password). My usecase is as follows:<br>   1. Client for APIs is AngularJS for now but there might be other clients in the future<br>   2.Users to login into the application with username and password i.e. UI layer (angular) to call login rest service and on successful authentication generate access token with an expiry time.<br>   3. Clients to use this generated access token to consume other APIs in the application<br></p>  <p>Please suggest a simple OAUTH2 configuration for the above usecase?</p>
