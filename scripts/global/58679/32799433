<p>I am trying to create a simple console application that retrieves a json stream using oauth2 authentication. I am at a total loss when it comes to the actual webrequest/response.</p>  <p>Google caused only additional confusion.. Anything like some sample code or to point me into the right direction on where to get started on this would be very much appreciated.</p>  <p>I was hoping to use .net Webrequest class to solve this.</p>  <p>Many thanks in advance.</p>
