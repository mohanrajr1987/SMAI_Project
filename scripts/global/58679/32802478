<p>I'm using Node + express to build an API. The idea is to be able to let other developers login and register their app so that i can authorize access to my API endpoints.</p>  <pre><code>exports = passport.use(new FacebookStrategy({      clientID: '999999999',     clientSecret: '999999999',     callbackURL: "http://localhost:3000/auth/facebook/callback"  },function(accessToken, refreshToken, profile, done) {      profile.access_token = accessToken;      db.mongoClient.connect(db.moments, function(err, db){         var user = db.collection('user');          user.find({'facebook':profile.id}).toArray(function(err, docs){             console.log(docs);         })     })      done(null, profile);  })); </code></pre>  <p>I have set this up using the <a href="http://passportjs.org/docs/facebook" rel="nofollow">passport facebook strategy</a>. This allows developers to login to a profile page on my app where they are presented with the access_token i got from facebook. I'm using this access_token to allow a connection between my app and their app using the <a href="https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-http-bearer" rel="nofollow">bearer token strategy</a>.</p>  <p>However, i also want to add another layer of security. They should register the domain name that is going to make API calls to my app. This should protect me from developers passing along the token to other developers (did i got that part right?).</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The question: How can i check that they are indeed making the request from the registered domain name?</p> </blockquote>  <p>thx,</p>
