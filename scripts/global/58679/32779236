<p><strong>I am currently working on the authentication system of my <code>ember</code> app.</strong></p>  <p>I have set up a custom OAuth 2.0 authentication system based on <code>torii</code> only (I don't use <code>simple-auth</code>). The system is almost working: <strong>I'm now trying to implement a token refresh logic.</strong>  </p>  <p>I thought of reopening the <code>torii</code> session service in an initializer to add a <code>refresh</code> method to its definition, but I get the following error when trying to import the <code>SessionService</code> class from the <code>torii</code> lib:  </p>  <pre><code>Error: Could not find module torii/services/torii-session imported from myapp/initializers/session </code></pre>  <p>Of course, I'm wondering if what I'm trying is the cleanest way of handling itâ€¦  </p>  <p><strong>By chance, does somebody have any best practice for access token refresh with <code>torii</code>? :-)</strong></p>  <p>Cheers from Berlin!</p>
