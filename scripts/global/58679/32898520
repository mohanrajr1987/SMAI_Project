<p>I'm writing an Android app that integrates with Fitbit and Jawbone.</p>  <p>I've already completed the Jawbone integration.  Jawbone uses OAUTH2 and they provide a default redirect URI of <a href="http://localhost/helloup" rel="nofollow">http://localhost/helloup</a>?</p>  <p>This is probably me not fully understanding OAUTH but I was under the impression that the redirect URI was used for processing the reply from the server.</p>  <p>In a mobile app this really doesn't make any sense to me.  I just want to POST to a server and get an accesstoken that I can use.</p>  <p>Can someone please explain to me the following:</p>  <ol> <li><p>What is the elementary school explanation of what the OAUTH redirect URI is used for?</p></li> <li><p>In a mobile app like Android how does the redirect URI factor in?  </p></li> </ol>  <p>I'm happy to elaborate on my question if what I'm asking is not clear enough.</p>  <p>Cheers</p>
