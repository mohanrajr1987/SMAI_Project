<p>I am newbie in oAuth 2.0. I have scenario in which there are 2 platform first is client side angular code and another one server side Node(Express) code. I want to implement oAuth 2.0 in background. The server application will communicate to google auth(Server will provide auth values) and without populating pop-up to end user i.e. to client app it will get authentication token. Then from angular app i want to call youtube api to access private channel video of user which token i received from server. I have read this articles <a href="https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/auth/installed-app" rel="nofollow">https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/auth/installed-app</a></p>  <p><a href="https://developers.google.com/console/help/new/?hl=en_US#creating-server-api-keys" rel="nofollow">https://developers.google.com/console/help/new/?hl=en_US#creating-server-api-keys</a></p>  <p>So my question is this possible. As server app is different and client app will be different.</p>
