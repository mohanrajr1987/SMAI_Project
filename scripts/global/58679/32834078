<p>I'm trying to add OTP/2FA support into OAuth2, but after much reading through the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749" rel="nofollow">RFC6749</a>, it's still not clear how OTP/2FA could be cleanly added without violating the specification.</p>  <p>Although OTP/2FA entry can be added into the <code>authorize</code> dialog flow, there is no provision for adding it into <code>token</code>. For example, <code>public</code> client apps with <code>Resource owner password-based</code> privileges may want to provide the token directly when requesting a new <code>access_token</code>, rather than having to embed a HTML dialog box.</p>  <p>Therefore my questions are;</p>  <ul> <li><p>Does the RFC allow for custom <code>grant_type</code>? Should this be used to provide 2FA/OTP functionality?</p></li> <li><p>Does the RFC allow for additional attributes on an existing <code>grant_type</code>? For example, <code>grant_type=token&amp;otp_code=1234</code> (RFC does not make it clear if additional attributes are allowed on <code>grant_type</code>'s within the specification)</p></li> <li><p>Should OTP functionality be placed into headers? This is the approach that Github <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/auth/" rel="nofollow">used</a>, but it feels really ugly/hacky.</p></li> <li><p>Are there any other approaches that I have overlooked?</p></li> </ul>  <p>Thank you in advance</p>
