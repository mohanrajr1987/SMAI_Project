<p>I'm currently using <strong>UseWindowsAzureActiveDirectoryBearerAuthentication</strong> to secure a Web API. This is fine at the moment as the test environments use Azure AD Identity.</p>  <p>However, the production environment will use a different Auth provider (OAuth 2 compliant).</p>  <p>What I'm looking for is to convert the following Azure AD specific code:</p>  <pre><code>app.UseWindowsAzureActiveDirectoryBearerAuthentication(                 new WindowsAzureActiveDirectoryBearerAuthenticationOptions                 {                     Audience = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ida:Audience"],                     Tenant = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ida:Tenant"]                 }); </code></pre>  <p>To something more generic that will still work with Azure AD for the moment but will be easy to configure for a different Auth provider in the future. For example:</p>  <pre><code>app.UseOAuthBearerAuthentication             (                 new OAuthBearerAuthenticationOptions()                 {                     //...                 }             ); </code></pre>  <p>How can the latter be implemented to work with Azure AD and also be "generic" enough for other OAuth 2 compliant providers?</p>
