<p><strong>Is there a way to mock (generate valid token-object) oauth v2.0 token (implicit grant strategy) for test purposes?</strong></p>  <p>I want to unit test access-token parsing from oAuth service and would be nice to have some piece of javascript code that does something like this:</p>  <ol> <li><p>generate valid object</p></li> <li><p>encode it with base64 encoding ( I think this is the one that is used )</p></li> </ol>  <p><strong>Or this is impossible due to some limitations?</strong></p>
