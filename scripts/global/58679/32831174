<p>I read the link below but I couldn't send mail with OAuth2 authentication mechanism. Can anyone give me an example about this ? </p>  <p>Without this authentication user have to enable less secure apps option from the gmail's security settings. But I don't want to push user to do that. That's why I need this authentication mechanism.</p>  <p>link: <a href="https://java.net/projects/javamail/pages/OAuth2" rel="nofollow">https://java.net/projects/javamail/pages/OAuth2</a></p>
