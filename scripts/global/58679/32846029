<p>I have a single page application (SPA) with a WebAPI and for authentication/authorization I am using OpenId Connect and specifically IdentityServer3 with OidcTokenManager on the client.</p>  <p>So, my SPA talks to the server fine by passing the access/bearer token in the Authorization header for all requests made to the WebAPI.</p>  <p>i.e. Authorization: Bearer ACCESSTOKENGOESHERE</p>  <p>The application also embeds files from the WebAPI into the page. Mainly svg's, pdf's etc. To do this I use an object tag. This doesn't work as the WebAPI requires the Bearer token in the authorization header to authorize the request. I cannot find anyway to pass the bearer token as a request header when the object tags load the file.</p>  <p>Does anyone know how I can pass the authorization header when the object tag makes a request for the files?</p>
