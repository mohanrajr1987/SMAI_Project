<p>What are the best practices for when to use a TokenStore or @EnableOAuth2Client (check_token) in resource server?</p>  <p>I have a Spring OAuth2 AuthorizationServer and several REST microservices (resource servers). At the moment I have a shared TokenStore for the AuthServer and for the resource servers, and it seems to be working fine. </p>  <p>I'm a bit confused about when to use the @EnableOAuth2Client, @EnableOAuth2Sso annotations and the access-token-uri. Is it best to use a shared TokenStore for resoruce servers and auth server. And then use access-token-uri for web applications consuming the resource servers?</p>  <p>Regard</p>
