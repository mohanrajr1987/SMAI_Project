<p>I have been trying to write a python (IPython Notebook) script to access and process Google Sheets data. </p>  <p>I have looked into gspread (<a href="http://gspread.readthedocs.org/en/latest/oauth2.html" rel="nofollow">http://gspread.readthedocs.org/en/latest/oauth2.html</a>) but the flow described requires that the spreadsheet to be shared with the registered google service account (client email). This does not work as my company google sheet does not allow sharing with "external" accounts. </p>  <p>However there seems to be a way to enable the access (authentication) as described here: <a href="https://developers.google.com/drive/web/quickstart/python" rel="nofollow">https://developers.google.com/drive/web/quickstart/python</a></p>  <p>Yet I cannot figure out how to do that in IPython notebook as the sample code seems to require command line arguments (that I don't understand). </p>  <p>Can anyone give a few samples on how to access Google Sheets <em>without</em> using the service account? </p>
