<p>I'm just wondering (as im starting to make a game with pygame) is there a way to 1) Run a program that only opens a GUI and not the shell and  2) Run the program without having to edit with idle (I'd like to do this so the game will look more professional.</p>  <p>I would like to just have a desktop shortcut or something that when clicked, runs only the GUI and doesnt show my code or show the shell.</p>
