<p>I am using pygame to capture an image, and I can't seem to get it right.  Attached is the image, and as you can see the image is split down the middle.</p>  <p>Here is the sourcecode:</p>  <pre><code>def getImg(fname):     pygame.camera.init()     cm = pygame.camera.list_cameras()      cam = pygame.camera.Camera(cm[0])     cam.start()     img = cam.get_image()     pygame.image.save(img,fname)     cam.stop() </code></pre>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/lLr04.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/lLr04.jpg" alt="Image I have a problem with"></a></p>
