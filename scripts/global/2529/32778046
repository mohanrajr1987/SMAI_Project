<p>I have a <a href="http://www.manhattan-products.com/webcam-5005" rel="nofollow">USB webcam</a> that includes a button meant to capture images in their software. I would like to capture this button press in python.</p>  <p>The project I am working on uses the webcam to read barcodes. I am able to do this using zbar, pygame and/or opencv. However, I would like to be able to toggle whether these codes are comming <code>in</code> or <code>out</code> using this button.</p>  <p>I have looked at pygame's joystick, midi and camera modules. The midi and joystick modules do not see the device, and the camera module works but doesn't know about the button. This seems like something opencv should be able to do, but I do not know where to look. I have also considered using Serial to listen for a specific code, but am unsure where to begin.</p>  <p>BTW, I am on Ubuntu 12.04.</p>
