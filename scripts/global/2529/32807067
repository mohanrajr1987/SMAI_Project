<p>Hi I was using cx_freeze 2.7 for a tutorial I was following and every time I used the program it would come up with an AssertionError. Here is my setup.py file if anyone wants to see:</p>  <pre><code>    import cx_Freeze       executables = [cx_Freeze.Executable("Slither.py")]     cx_Freeze.setup(           name = "Slither",           options = {"build_exe": {"packages":["pygame"],"include_files": ["apple.png","snakehead.png","funnydog.png"]}},     executables = executables       ) </code></pre>
