<p>I'm making a platform game which is mostly based on recreate the very first Super Mario Bros.</p>  <p>For now what I need is to know when the player (object) stops colliding with a wall (object). I know when it does collide, for example when player.rect.bottom == wall.rect.top then Floor state = 1. How can I make Floor state = 0 (which would make he fall) if player is no longer colliding.</p>  <p>I already tried by using :</p>  <pre><code>if player.rect.bottomleft  == wall.rect.topright or player.rect.bottomright == wall.rect.topleft:         Floor = 1 </code></pre>  <p>That makes the player fall if it's in the corner. But if the player has an acceleration, it won't pass through this point, Floor will still be Floor = 1 and the player won't fall, he'll be afloat or flying. Thanks</p>  <p>Is there anyway to know when it stops colliding, which would allow me to change Floor's value?</p>
