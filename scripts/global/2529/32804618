I have installed <code>pygame</code> by using windows installer. but still getting following error.let me know how to use <code>castro</code></p>  <pre><code>C:\Python35-32\Scripts&gt;pip install pygame==1.9.1release Collecting pygame==1.9.1release Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement pygame==1.9.1release (from versions: ) Some externally hosted files were ignored as access to them may be unreliable (use --allow-external pygame to allow). No matching distribution found for pygame==1.9.1release </code></pre>
