<p>I'm trying to install PGU on python 2.7, but it just does not appear. I've already installed it on python 3.4 and it works just fine. I am using the msi installer from <a href="http://pygame.org/download.shtml" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I run the installer, it says that everything is ok, but python says there's no module named 'pgu', and it doesn't appear in site-packages folder. When I try to run the installer again it proposes me to either repair the current installation or remove PGU. Thanks in advance.</p>
