<p>Currently I am making a small game in pygame, I was wondering if there is a way to move the class from outside of the original class function. Currently it looks like:</p>  <pre><code>class Player(pygame.sprite.Sprite):     def __init__(self,):         super().__init__()         self.image = Playerimg         self.rect = self.image.get_rect()         self.image = pygame.transform.scale(Playerimg,(42,42))         self.startposx = 298         self.startposy = 358         self.rect.x = self.startposx         self.rect.y = self.startposy     def update(self):         ..... etc </code></pre>  <p>Is there a way of making it so that you can change the value of self.rect.x and self.rect.y from outside the function?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
