<p>I've found dozens of tutorials on how and when to use sprites, but I still don't really know what they are or what they do. The default idea seems to be that you subclass the <code>pygame.sprite.Sprite</code> class and add <code>rect</code> and <code>image</code> attributes to the class. But why do I need to subclass the <code>Sprite</code> class, how does it affect my code? I can just do this anyways:</p>  <pre><code>class MySprite:  # No subclassing!     def __init__(self, image):         self.image = image         self.rect = image.get_rect() </code></pre>  <p>And it seems to work just fine. I also tried going through the source code, but <a href="http://i.imgur.com/esaTKdt.png" rel="nofollow">couldn't find a sprite file</a>.</p>
