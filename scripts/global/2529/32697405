<p>I want this simulation of paint to work such that if the mouse button is pressed, it starts drawing ( button is released instantly).  Again, when the button is pressed, it should stop drawing.</p>  <p>There is no error. In the present case shared it basically always remains the pen down (drawing) mode. I have tried the <code>get_pressed</code> function but succeeded in drawing only when the key remains pressed. I tried making it equal to <code>(a,0,0)</code> and vary <code>a</code> to achieve the goal but was unsuccessful.</p>  <p>After a few attempts it resulted in the drawing mode turning on or off instantaneously instead of on click.</p>  <p>Here's the part that controls the action:</p>  <pre><code>while keepGoing:     clock.tick(30)      for event in pygame.event.get():         if event.type == pygame.QUIT:             keepGoing = False         elif event.type == pygame.MOUSEMOTION:             lineEnd = pygame.mouse.get_pos()             if pygame.MOUSEBUTTONUP:                 pygame.draw.line(background, drawColor, lineStart, lineEnd, lineWidth)             lineStart = lineEnd         elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:             myData = (event, background, drawColor, lineWidth, keepGoing)             myData = checkKeys(myData)             (event, background, drawColor, lineWidth, keepGoing) = myData     screen.blit(background, (0, 0))     myLabel = showStats(drawColor, lineWidth)     screen.blit(myLabel, (450, 450))     pygame.display.flip() </code></pre>  <p>Complete Code link:  <a href="http://codeshare.io/gbPc0" rel="nofollow">http://codeshare.io/gbPc0</a></p>
