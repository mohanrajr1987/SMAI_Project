<p>I have created a fully functioning chess game with pygame in python. The only current on-screen options I have are the reset button (to reset the game board) and the quit button, to quit the game. I want to create an option for the user to save and load a game at any time they like, so that it will store the piece positions and whose turn it is. I've tried using the pickle module for this, but I can't seem to grasp how it works, or whether or not it will actually work with pygame.  </p>
