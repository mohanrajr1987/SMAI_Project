<p>I am working on windows 8.1 64 bit machine with 32 bit python 2.7 and 32 bit cx_Freeze. I used cx_Freeze and it creates an exe of the required files but as soon as I open the exe it shows not responding dialog box and crashes. Here is my code for setup.py file for cx_freeze.</p>  <pre><code>import cx_Freeze  executables = [cx_Freeze.Executable("1.py")]  cx_Freeze.setup(      name = "Space Attack",      version = "1.0",      description = "Space Shooter",      author = "Kocha",      options = {"build_exe":{"packages":["pygame"],"include_files":["Bulletcropped.png","eship2.png","gameover.png","health.png","healthbar.png","ship.png","youwin.png","boss.xm","enemy.wav","explode.wav","shoot.wav","spacebackground.jpg"]}},      executables = executables         ) </code></pre>  <p>1.py is the name of the game which I have created using pygame 32 bit as well.</p>
