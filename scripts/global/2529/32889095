<p>I have installed anaconda on my on Mac OS(10.9.2), but it's often very slow to open the launcher. Sometimes I can solve it with </p>  <pre><code>conda install -f launcher </code></pre>  <p>anyone know what's the reason for this.</p>  <p>Therefore,I want to use spyder directly, I have installed spyder and want to change python interpreter path to anaconda, how I can set the directory information there in Preferences > Console > Advanced Settings > Python executable? (the anaconda is installed under applications).</p>  <p>In addition, if I can open anaconda, how I can install <strong>pygame</strong> on it? Thanks!</p>
