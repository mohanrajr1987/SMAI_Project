<p>I don't really want to move the whole world in my game but I do want the screen to follow my character. </p>  <p>So for example, normally pygame would render at the position of 0,0 and the window height width would allow you to expand that viewing area. But I want to move the starting position so that I can view something at coordinates 1000x1000 even if my screen is only 500x500 big.</p>
