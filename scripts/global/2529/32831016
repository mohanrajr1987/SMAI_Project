<p>Win 10/64bit/3.5:</p>  <p>I want to pass a list of .mp3s from within a variable (<strong>mp3Fin</strong>) to <strong>pygame.mixer.music.load()</strong>. Is there a way to do this? PyGame does work when I load separately. I've only been learning programming/python for the last couple weeks and am new to stackoverflow, so sorry if I left anything out.</p>  <p><strong>Last Edit</strong> Here is the latest code as it should be, properly formatted/indented. It is still getting an error, but the error has changed to something related to 'Rwops'. Only found a few links off bing about Rwops. Will delete the previous code because I don't think they're helpful anymore.</p>  <p><strong>Code:</strong></p>  <pre><code>if catChow == cat1[0]:         print("Welcome to SoCha's music player.")            def get_files(directories):             mp3Pre = []             for root, directories, files in os.walk(directories):                 for filename in files:                 #Joins the two strings in order to form the full filepath.                     filepath = os.path.join(root, filename)                     mp3Pre.append(filepath) #Adds to the mp3PreParse variable above.             return mp3Pre         mp3Post = get_files("C:\\Users\\SoCha\\Music")         pygame.mixer.init()         pygame.mixer.music.load([s for s in mp3Post if s.endswith(".mp3")])         pygame.mixer.music.play() </code></pre>  <p><strong>Rwops Error:</strong></p>  <pre><code>Welcome to SoCha's music player. Traceback (most recent call last):   File "SoChaOS.2.0.py", line 38, in &lt;module&gt;     pygame.mixer.music.load([s for s in mp3Post if s.endswith(".mp3")]) pygame.error: Couldn't read from RWops  ***Repl Closed*** </code></pre>  <p>This is the last edit I'm making on this original post.</p>
