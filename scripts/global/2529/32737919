<p>So I've noticed that character only moves when my velocity is greater than 1 and is an integer but the question is why I can't use move_ip() function to have my character move slower than 1 velocity and in between 1 and 0?.</p>  <p>Here is the code that I use:</p>  <pre><code>def Physics():     for k, v in enumerate(ENTITIES):         vel     = ENTITIES[k].GetVelocity()         pos     = ENTITIES[k].GetPos()          vel[1] = vel[1] + 0.1         ENTITIES[k].Entity.move_ip(vel) </code></pre>
