<p>I am using pygame's joystick api to use a joystick with my project on a headless system, but pygame requires a "screen" so I have setup a dummy video system to over come this. It worked fine but now all of a sudden it gives me this error:</p>  <pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):   File "compact.py", line 10, in &lt;module&gt;     screen = display.set_mode((1, 1)) pygame.error: Unable to open a console terminal </code></pre>  <p>Here is what I have as the headless setup that is supposed to over come this issue. </p>  <pre><code>from pygame import * import os import RPi.GPIO as GPIO os.environ["SDL_VIDEODRIVER"] = "dummy" screen = display.set_mode((1, 1)) </code></pre>
