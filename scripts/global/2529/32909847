<p>In pygame, when I draw a rectangle, corners are not filled like I want them to be. It looks like:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/1okES.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/1okES.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>The problem is the same even with thick lines so I don't think it is the problem.</p>  <p>In another drawing library there were line styles like square or round. I searched everywhere and I couldn't find something similar. Anyone knows how this can be done without filling the corners manually?</p>  <pre><code>import pygame  pygame.init() while True:     window = pygame.display.set_mode((500, 500))     pygame.draw.rect(window, (255, 255, 255), (100, 100, 100, 100), 10)     pygame.display.flip() </code></pre>
