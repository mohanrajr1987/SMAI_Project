<p>Good morning,</p>  <p>I need to create an animation to explain my physical experiment easily. I've never worked with pygame before but it seems to be very easy to move objects, calculate movements and use full power of python. Just to be sure: I don't want to make a simulation!</p>  <p>My question is: Is it possible to export the animation into a video file? I was thinking about to save each frame as an image and make a video file of these images. But does there exist a function/module to do that out of the box?</p>  <p>I found this code which seems to be useful: <a href="http://pymedia.org/tut/src/make_video.py.html" rel="nofollow">http://pymedia.org/tut/src/make_video.py.html</a></p>  <p>Do you have some ideas or experience?</p>  <p>Bests, Alex</p>
