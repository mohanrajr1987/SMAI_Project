<p>I'm making a text-based adventure of sorts, and I've currently managed to get a Tkinter window up and running with two frames, one showing a pygame screen and the other a command-line-esque input and log.</p>  <p>I would like to be able to show a tile-based map of sorts of the world, with one room equalling one tile. This I've been able to get working too by using the <code>tmx</code> module and then shoehorning it into a Tkinter frame. </p>  <p>However, it doesn't really work very well, and I was wondering if there were any Python 3 examples of such a tile-game inside Tkinter (say another text adventure?) that I could learn from.</p>  <p>I'm not sure this is the right place to ask this either, so I apologise if this is wrong.</p>
