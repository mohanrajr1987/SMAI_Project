<pre><code>import random thenum = random.randint(1000, 9999) print (thenum) tally = 1 guessone = int(input("What is your first guess?: ")) strguessone = str(guessone) strthenum = str(thenum) if strguessone [0] == strthenum [0]:     tally + 1 if  strguessone [1] ==  strthenum [1]:     tally + 1 if strguessone [2] == strthenum [2]:     tally + 1 if  strguessone [3] ==  strthenum [3]:     tally + 1  print (tally) if tally == 5:     print ("You Win") </code></pre>  <p>When I run this code I only get a response of one from the print tally why is that I add the tally within the if statements I know that I should be using loops but I figured this is what i want to do</p>
