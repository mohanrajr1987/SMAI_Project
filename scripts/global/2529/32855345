<p>I am trying to make a game with Pygame similar to the Oregon Trail Games.  I'm pretty new to Python and Pygame so I'm not sure how this could be done.  I would like it so that the background is an certain image, for example, the first background could be "Image 1".  Image 1 would say: Press "K" to do this or press "J" to do this instead.  I would like it to go to "image 2" if you press K and go to "image 3" if you press J.  I would think it would be pretty simple but basically I want it so that the background has to be a certain image to press that key to go to another image.  A code example would be awesome, THANKS!</p>
