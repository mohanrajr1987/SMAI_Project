<p>I am trying to make a script in python for pygame to draw a button with text centered, but when I blit onto the screen, it blits to the x and y I give it, not a proportionally centered location. I want to be able to center it to a set of (x,y,w,h). How would I do this? Here's my code:</p>  <pre><code># Imports import pygame  class Text:     'Centered Text Class'     # Constructror     def __init__(self, text, (x,y,w,h), color = (0,0,0)):         self.x = x         self.y = y         self.w = w         self.h = h         # Start PyGame Font         pygame.font.init()         font = pygame.font.SysFont("sans", 20)         self.txt = font.render(text, True, color)     # Draw Method     def Draw(self, screen):         coords = (self.x, self.y)         screen.blit(self.txt, coords) </code></pre>  <p>Edit: Comments, yes I know but I only used x and y as temporary variables because I have no idea what the centered x and y would be to center the text. (I want to know how to center its CENTER to a rect, not its top left corner)</p>
