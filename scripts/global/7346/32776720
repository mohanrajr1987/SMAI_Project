<p>I am using a third party plugin Telerik RadEditor version 2011.01.0519.35. There suppose to be a popup that allows me to paste the content.  <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/PQmkm.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/PQmkm.png" alt="Popup found in all other version of browsers except IE"></a></p>  <p>Popup found works ok in all other version of browsers but disappear in IEs except IE edge. The only message that I can found is the warning message from IE console: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/WAFYO.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/WAFYO.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Can someone point me out on what is the problem?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
