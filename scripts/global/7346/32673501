<p>An application that I've written (<a href="https://github.com/JuliusSweetland/OptiKey" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/JuliusSweetland/OptiKey</a>) requests UIAccess (to be able to be rendered above everything) and has a modal popup window styled using MahApps.Metro. When run on Windows 8/8.1 everything is fine, but on Windows 10 the popup window does not display (is not rendered anywhere), but is visible in the taskbar. Hovering over the thumbnail displays the preview, but the window can never be made visible.</p>  <p>I have narrowed the problem down to Windows 10 and whether the <strong>UIAccess="true"</strong> setting in the manifest is true/false (it is fine if set to false).</p>  <p>I initially thought the problem was linked to the .Net 2.0.0.0 runtime not being present on a default install of Windows 10, as the problem went away when I installed Snoop (which I think installed .Net 3.5 and so the 2.0.0.0 runtime), but to prove the fix I uninstalled .Net 3.5, which brought back the issue with the child window, and then re-installed .Net 3.5, which did NOT resolve the issue again.</p>  <p>I have tried the following:</p>  <ol> <li>Running application as admin = no fix</li> <li>Updating all graphics drivers = no fix</li> <li>Checking the event logs = nothing</li> <li>Converting my child (popup) window to be non-modal = no fix</li> <li>Converting my child (popup) window to be a standard Window class, rather than a MetroWindow (MahApps) = no fix</li> <li>4 &amp; 5 = no fix</li> <li>Installing .Net 3.5 = no fix</li> </ol>  <p>The only thing that works is setting UIAccess="false", but I need it to be true.</p>  <p>N.B. UIAccess is working correctly on Windows 8.1, and I have fulfilled the requirements (adding UIAccess="true" to the manifest, signing the assembly, and running from a protected directory "Program Files")</p>  <p>Any idea what is going on?</p>
