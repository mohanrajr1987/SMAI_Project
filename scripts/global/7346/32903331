<p>This is an accounting app, WinKonto, and this bar pops up at bottom and covers that part of the view when a text field gets focus - when accounting in a grid, this means all the time. The user is just entering short numbers, so it's quite superfluous. I've tried UIRequiresFullscreen=true in info.plist and set IOS Deployment target to 7.1, but no dice.</p>  <p>What's the official name of this bar, and how do I prevent it from appearing?</p>
