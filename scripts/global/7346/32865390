<p>I found some ways to make javascript/jquery popup windows. But, there were some problems, first of all, I am not very good with these two languages, just beginner.</p>  <p>If there is any ready code, for opening POPUP window on website load, but only once per browser session. It would be very nice, if someone could help me with this.</p>  <p>I need simple popup, with just some text in it, but design for popup box something good looking, not like original browser popup (like in image), of course, with closing button.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/xNWxf.png" rel="nofollow">http://i.stack.imgur.com/xNWxf.png</a></p>  <p>Thanks a lot</p>
