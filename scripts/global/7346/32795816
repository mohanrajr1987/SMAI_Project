<p>I have made 2 user controls. First one contains a textbox and a button. In the second one there is a panel and a repeater control is used. Now when I am writing in the textbox 2nd control will open as a popup and and after focusing to textbox I am unable to write. I have searched a lot about this but nothing works.</p>  <pre><code>CustomPopup customPopup; Popup popup; popup = new Popup(customPopup = new CustomPopup());  private void txtSearch_TextChanged(object sender, EventArgs e) {     popup.Width = Width;     popup.Show(this);     popup.AutoClose = false; } </code></pre>  <p>In this way I am opening the popup from the textbox text changed event.</p>
