<p>I'm stuck on this one after much searching....</p>  <p>I started with scraping the contents of a table from:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.skatepress.com/skates-top-10000/artworks/" rel="nofollow">http://www.skatepress.com/skates-top-10000/artworks/</a></p>  <p>Which is easy: </p>  <pre><code>data &lt;- data.frame() for (i in 1:100){   print(paste("page", i, "of 100"))   url &lt;- paste("http://www.skatepress.com/skates-top-10000/artworks/", i, "/", sep = "")   temp &lt;- readHTMLTable(stringsAsFactors = FALSE, url, which = 1, encoding = "UTF-8")    data &lt;- rbind(data, temp) } # end of scraping loop </code></pre>  <p>However, I need to additionally scrape the detail that is contained in a pop-up box when you click on each name (and on the artwork title) in the list on the site. </p>  <p>I can't for the life of me figure out how to pass the breadcrumb (or artist-id or painting-id) through in order to make this happen. Since straight up using rvest to access the contents of the nodes doesn't work, I've tried the following:</p>  <p>I tried passing the painting id through in the url like this: </p>  <pre><code>url &lt;- ("http://www.skatepress.com/skates-top-10000/artworks/?painting_id=576") site &lt;- html(url) </code></pre>  <p>But it still gives an empty result when scraping:</p>  <pre><code>  node1 &lt;- "bread-crumb &gt; ul &gt; li.activebc"   site %&gt;% html_nodes(node1) %&gt;% html_text(trim = TRUE)  character(0) </code></pre>  <p>I'm (clearly) not a scraping expert so any and all assistance would be greatly appreciated! I need a way to capture this additional information for each of the 10,000 items on the list...hence why I'm not interested in doing this manually! </p>  <p>Hoping this is an easy one and I'm just overlooking something simple. </p>
