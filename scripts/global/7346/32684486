<p>I'm aware that this might not be a proper question? But I'm looking for the possible solutions for the following problem that I have:</p>  <p>I need a popup control in ASP.NET which would allow me to once button is pressed, the popup would appear, and once thats done, I would like to send an ID through that event and populate the popup window dynamically.</p>  <p>I have tried to use Modal popup extender control within ajax control toolkit, but it didn't do the good job as I wanted it ... </p>  <p>So my question is, what other libraries are out there that offer this kind of popup ? :)</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
