<p>Since printing is not compatible with Filemaker WebDirect as desired, I alternatively want to do a popup window of the printable layout similar to the way I see it done with Google Maps, so in my scripting logic if Get(SystemPlatform) = 4, I want to have a popup layout with no buttons to go back and such and assuming the user will need to not block such popups anyways.  </p>  <p>Is there a way to get a popup to work for this? I tried display as popover and that didn't seem to work as desired since it also printed the backgroud as well.</p>
