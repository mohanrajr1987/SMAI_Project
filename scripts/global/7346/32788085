<p>I have a popup that I created that works just fine, but for some reason I am having issues with the background-color opacity. On my page the script runs and I am not getting any errors. When the popup first comes up it shows the opacity, but then very quickly the color turns a bit darker and is a solid color rather than having any transparency. I created a fiddle, but cannot get it to perfectly replicate what is going on in my page. In my fiddle, it does not allow the popup to close, but on my page that is not the case. </p>  <p><a href="https://jsfiddle.net/hvLtezza/" rel="nofollow">https://jsfiddle.net/hvLtezza/</a></p>  <p>On my site it looks like this...</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Y6zhs.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Y6zhs.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I have the almost exact same popup else where on this same page, with this as the jquery and I do not have any issues.</p>  <pre><code>//Tech Help pop up script     $('.admin_popup').on('click',function(){         $(".light_admin,.white_overlay").fadeIn("slow");     });      $('.close_admin_popup').on('click',function(){         $(".light_admin,.white_overlay").fadeOut("slow");      }); </code></pre>  <p>I cannot change my jquery in the jsfiddle I shared because it has a function in it that I need to get my page to work correctly.</p>  <p>Does anyone see why my page is not allowing the opacity to go through?</p>
