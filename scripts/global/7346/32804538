<p>I am trying to figure out how to create a popup message that asks for an employee ID number so that can edit the spreadsheet. </p>  <p>My idea is that I should be able to a validate user response with a list of employee ID numbers in a tab. And if it doesn't validate I would like it to redirect user to a URL or for example, www.google.com.</p>  <p>I have the first part, and can get the submission from the user, but I am not sure how to do anything farther than that, my expertise does not extend this far. </p>  <p>Reasoning for this is, is that I have quite a few employees, and would like to make sure that if they have the link that I would be able to still stop them from trying to do anything with my spreadsheet, as it is very important on a hourly and daily basis. </p>  <p>Here is what I have so far...</p>  <p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false"> <div class="snippet-code"> <pre class="snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>function onOpen() {   var ui = SpreadsheetApp.getUi();    var result = ui.prompt(       'NEH Sales Tracker v4.0 Access',       'Enter employee ID Number',       ui.ButtonSet.OK_CANCEL);        // Validate user's response function validateForm() {     var x = document.forms["myForm"]["fname"].value;     if (x == null || x =="") {         alert("Name must be filled out");         return false;     } }}</code></pre> </div> </div> </p>
