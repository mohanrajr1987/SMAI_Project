<p>I'm developing a web forms application in .NET, however I'm more well versed in back end programming rather than front end. I need a pop-up window which is meant to show up and collect the experience from the user with the application, done by three image buttons, each with their own event.</p>  <p>For this purpose, I found a CSS based modal window that I modified so that it looks like the pop-up I want. The html for this is as follows:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;a href="#test" class="btn btn-big"&gt;Modal!&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="#" runat="server" id="test" class="modal" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;div runat="server" id="dia" class="modal-dialog"&gt; &lt;h3&gt;How was your experience?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="modal-body"&gt; &lt;asp:ImageButton ID="ImageButton1" imageURL="~/resources/smileyface.png" runat="server" Width="75" Height="75" /&gt;     &lt;asp:ImageButton ID="ImageButton2" imageURL="~/resources/neutralface.png" runat="server" Width="75" Height="75" /&gt; &lt;asp:ImageButton ID="ImageButton3" imageURL="~/resources/sadface.png" runat="server" Width="75" Height="75" /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>This produces a button named Modal (first a tag) and opens the window with a nice transition specified by the CSS.</p>  <p>I want to be able to make the pop-up visible from code behind. Something like</p>  <pre><code>popup.Visible=true; </code></pre>  <p>And to be able to catch the OnClick events of the three image buttons.</p>  <p>Could anyone point me in the right direction? Thank you in advance.</p>
