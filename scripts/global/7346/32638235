<p>I am on the parent page from which I use javascript in jsp, to open a popup and I used the method window.open("url","windowName"," width,height,locastionx, locationy") to get a popup. Everything works fine in all browsers(like Mozilla, Chrome etc) except that the Popup doesn't show the url or address bar in Internet Explorer 10. </p>  <p>I am attaching the screenshots for reference</p>  <p>The following screenshot is a popup from IE</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/tz896.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/tz896.png" alt="IE10"></a></p>  <p>The following is a screenshot of popup from Mozilla </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/tkOx9.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/tkOx9.png" alt="Mozilla"></a></p>  <p>Is there a way in which the window.open method which will show address bar in the IE? </p>  <p>Thanks for helping</p>  <p>I did read in few online blogs that the behaviour of the popup is different with the IE7 or above than in the Mozilla or the Chrome browsers. </p>
