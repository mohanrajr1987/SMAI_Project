<p>I have the following code for my homepage:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div class="unit one-fifth" style="width: 18.6%;  padding-top: 0px;"&gt;*content of my sidebar*&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="unit four-fifths" style="width: 81.4%;  padding-top: 0px;"&gt; content of my page*&lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I'm currently using <a href="https://github.com/cobyism/gridism" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/cobyism/gridism</a> as my grid framework.  The thing is that I have several buttons or texts that open a popup window to filter certain search criteria.</p>  <p>This, for example:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;a href="#" onclick="window.open("Modulos.php?modname=misc/EscogerCurso.php","","scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=800,height=400"); return false;"&gt;Escoger&lt;/a&gt; </code></pre>  <p>The problem is that these popup windows open with the same Grid system, but they won't load the sidebar, only the main content:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div class="unit four-fifths" style="width: 81.4%;  padding-top: 0px;"&gt; content of the popup*&lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>The problem is evident: the popup loads leaving 20% of the page blank... <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Wr2Wk.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Wr2Wk.png" alt="the main Div is only 80%"></a></p>  <p>The main Div is only 80% of the page, the remaining 20% is for the sidebar. What could I do? I was thinking maybe some conditional that recognizes the popup and changes the class of the main Div, or changes the width from 80% to 100%, but I certainly don't know how.</p>  <p>Thanks for your time.</p>
