<p>When using the deep linking feature in iOS 9, the first new system popup is displayed that says '{your app} would like to open Facebook' there is also a popup that accompanies the call back 'Facebook would like to open {your app}'</p>  <p>I have whitelisted the FB URL's so that if user pushes 'OK' everything works fine... However, in order to improve my apps workflow, I need to be able to handle if the user presses 'Cancel' on the initial popup.</p>  <p>How can I capture if user presses 'Cancel' on the new iOS 9 deep linking system popup(s)?</p>  <p>I am building using Xcode 6.4 and Facebook SDK 4.5</p>
