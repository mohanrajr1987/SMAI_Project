<p>Is there any way to influence the size of the image displayed? In other words: Can I achieve the same size for the full image even if the original pictures have different sizes?</p>  <p>Many thanks Michael</p>  <p>The Q&amp;A "found the answer. It can be done by changing the respective class's css properties manually. But, that is also fixed for all images." states like this. Which css property has to be changed?</p>
