<p>I'm trying to create a message dialogue in Powershell where the user has no option to action on the message as that is the intention. So the message will have the X button grayed along with the buttons (not showing buttons are even better).</p>  <p>The closest I could reach was disabling the X via below code:</p>  <pre><code>$wshell = New-Object -ComObject Wscript.Shell -ErrorAction Stop $wshell.Popup("Aborted",0,"ERROR!",48+4) </code></pre>  <p>But cannot figure out disabling button part. Below MS articles were of little help as well:</p>  <p><a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/heyscriptingguy/archive/2006/07/27/how-can-i-display-a-message-box-that-has-no-buttons-and-that-disappears-after-a-specified-period-of-time.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.technet.com/b/heyscriptingguy/archive/2006/07/27/how-can-i-display-a-message-box-that-has-no-buttons-and-that-disappears-after-a-specified-period-of-time.aspx</a></p>  <p><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/x83z1d9f(v=vs.84).aspx" rel="nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/x83z1d9f(v=vs.84).aspx</a></p>  <p>Referred to few other articles over net some even suggesting custom made buttons using HTML, or VB library. But not what I was looking for.</p>  <p>Any help/hint/suggestion would be deeply appreciated.</p>  <p>Regards, Shakti</p>
