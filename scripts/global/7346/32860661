<p>I am relatively new to VBA.</p>  <p>I have a table <code>Range(E16:DW39)</code>, where each Cell has a dropdown menu <code>(Data Validation = List)</code> to pick a value manually BUT at the same time I have a Macro to copy data from another worksheet (two ways to populate the table).</p>  <p>I want to get a Message every time the user changes any cell value <strong><em>Manually</em></strong>. </p>  <p>I want to be able to still run the Macro (as I noticed that I cannot after adding the following code) independently. This Intersect check I want it only for the manual data input.</p>  <p>In order to do this check I have the following code (in the specific Sheet):</p>  <pre><code>Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal Target As Range) ------------------------------------------------------ Dim myRange As Range  myRange = Range("E16:DW39") '-&gt; Mission Mix Table  If Intersect(myRange, Target) Then  MsgBox "Mission Plan is not matching with this change"  End If  End Sub ------------------------------------------------ </code></pre>  <p>I get the following ERROR </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Run-Time Error 91: Object variable or With block variable not set</p> </blockquote>  <p>When I tried to change a cell value to another one from the dropdown menu, I get the above ERROR, any idea how to solve this problem?</p>  <p>Please notice that due to this code I cannot run my previously running fine Copy macro.</p>
