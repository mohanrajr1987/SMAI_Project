<p>I have a set of html webpages for my website. The website has been fully completed except for the popup, which is supposed to be loaded automatically when a user accesses the homepage of the website. This popup, which will be loaded in the middle of the homepage, will contain an image (900x400) with a close button on the top left of the popup. </p>  <p>I have tried numerous sources and many of these web resources require the user to click on the link for the popup to appear. I am not looking for the user to click to have the popup displayed. I want the user to be automatically shown the popup when the user accesses the homepage.</p>  <p>May someone please assist me through this issue?</p>
