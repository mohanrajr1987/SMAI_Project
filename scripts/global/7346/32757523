<p>I have multi-language Wordpress website and I use different Mailchimp pop up subscribe forms for different languages. I need that pop up form would appear with the delay of 30 sec and also when the user tries to exit the website. </p>  <p>Any suggestions? Maybe there is a plugin or smth to achieve this? </p>  <p>Thank you!</p>
