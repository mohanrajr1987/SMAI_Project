<p>I am using a <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-fancybox/" rel="nofollow">Easy FancyBox Plugin</a> in wordpress i have saved it's <code>settings</code> in <code>wordpress admin</code> panel.</p>  <p>Now, problem is it enables itself on every image that is linked.  I want to <code>exclude</code> some links to open as fancybox. Like <code>logo</code> or <code>Product category images</code> it is not an ecommerce website but it displays its products category wise.</p>  <p>When i click on click on category images instead of taking me onto that category it tries to open it in fancybox and as that image does not have any image path in the <code>href</code> it keeps on loading.</p>  <p>I have tries some solutions listed below but are not working in my case, like in the documentation itself they say just use <code>class="nofancybox"</code> and it will be excluded. But it didn't worked for me.</p>  <p>Already Tried.</p>  <p><a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-easy-fancybox-disable-fancybox-on-individual-images" rel="nofollow">Disable Fancybox on individual images</a></p>  <p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-fancybox/faq/" rel="nofollow">Can I exclude images or other links from auto-attribution</a></p>  <p>Please assist.</p>
