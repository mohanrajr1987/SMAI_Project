<p>I recently started a project using Symfony, and as a part of it, there is a Sonata (modeled) backoffice. I love the way Sonata make that lists of items where you can search / filter or wathever.. So, the question is:</p>  <p><strong>Can I reuse this lists as a popup for example to select a user of my DB?</strong></p>  <p>The example is easy:</p>  <ul> <li>I have a user table on my DB</li> <li>I have a form where you can select a user in one input but, there is 10.000 in the DB so a select is not an option.</li> <li>I'd love to use the user list of my sonata project in a popup and when the client click on a user of the list I would put it on the base form.</li> </ul>  <p>Is that possible? Is there a way for that?</p>
