<p>At the moment I am working on an APP. I am trying to find out why the methods from my webservices are not working but because I'm working with javascript in the app developer I am not able to debug my C# (Cordova and visual studio). Is there a way for me to write popups in the C# code so I can still see the values of my objects and properies?</p>  <p>So: I want to be able to force a popup from C# while running the javascript APP because I can not debug my C# code since it's only a webservice.</p>
