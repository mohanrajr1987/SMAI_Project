<p>I want to send a log to another computer but what I get is that I received myself, not the other computer.</p>  <p>Important that if possible, I don't want to be required any configuration on the receiver server.</p>  <p>This is what I do:</p>  <pre><code>logger -n 192.16.0.213 -t myapp -p user.notice "FOO BAR" </code></pre>  <p>The result is that the other computer doesn't receive anything, it's me who received the msg, I do : <code>tail var/log/syslog</code> and I see the message.</p>  <p>Does anyone know how to work it outÂ¿? It doesn't have to be achieved with logger necessarily, it's preferably, but it could be performed with netcat or using Python or whatever. The simpler the better.</p>  <p>Thank you in advance</p>
