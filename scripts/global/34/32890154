<p>Please see following python code: <br></p>  <pre><code>signal.pthread_sigmask(signal.SIG_BLOCK, range(1, signal.NSIG)) #block signals time.sleep(60) #waiting 60 seconds pending = signal.sigpending() #check how much signals in pending state </code></pre>  <p>When application is sleep I am sending for example five SIGUSR1 signals, but I received only one SIGUSR1 signal in pending. <br><strong>Can I receive all SIGUSR1 signals which were sent ?</strong></p>
