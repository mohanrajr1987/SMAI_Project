<p>I was following the instructions <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/compilation.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> and I'm having trouble getting the installation to work.  Basically, the first part works fine.  I downloaded portaudio, followed the instructions, and it all seemed to work.</p>  <p>However, when I tried<code>python3 setup.py install</code>, I got an error.  The error came from the /src/_portaudiomodule.c file, and it said that "The file Python.h could not be found".  I don't really understand what's going on because there was no Python.h file when I extracted the PyAudio archive.  I don't know where the Python.h file was supposed to come from.</p>  <p>I'm kind of a noob to unix systems so I could have easily made a mistake somewhere.  I've been trying to solve this for hours and I've had no luck so far.  Thanks in advance for your help!</p>
