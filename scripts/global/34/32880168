<p>I execute the following command in Unix </p>  <pre><code>$ date --date='06/01/2015 00:00:00' +%s 1433142000 </code></pre>  <p>when i convert it to date, it is as follows:</p>  <pre><code>Date in your timezone*: 6/1/2015, 12:30:00 PM </code></pre>  <p>I executed the following command in Mac</p>  <pre><code>$ date -j -f "%Y-%m-%d" "2015-06-01" "+%s" 1433221179 </code></pre>  <p>when i convert it to date, it is as follows:</p>  <pre><code>Date in your timezone*: 6/2/2015, 10:29:39 AM </code></pre>  <p>I found this command online to convert to PDT timezone(in my mac):</p>  <pre><code>$ export TZ=America/Los_Angeles $ date -j -f "%Y-%m-%d" "2015-06-01" "+%s" 1433221424 </code></pre>  <p>when i convert it to date, it is as follows:</p>  <pre><code>Date in your timezone*: 6/2/2015, 10:33:44 AM </code></pre>  <p>Unix is my production environment and Mac is my local environment.  I want to write a script(which will convert my date to timestamp) such that if my prod environment gives 6/1/2015 then, the script which i execute should also give 6/1/2015 instead of 6/2/2015.</p>  <p>My prod(unix) is set in PDT and my local is IST. As mentioned i already tried setting TZ=America/Los_Angeles but still i do not get the same dates.</p>  <p>Please help</p>
