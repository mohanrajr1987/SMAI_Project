<p>I've started using a database at work that is based off SQL and Unix. </p>  <p>I am surprised to learn, that if someone requests for a change to be made to their details at around 5PM or a certain date, then the person who is allocated the incident then has to WAIT until 5pm and make the changes manually.</p>  <p>I'm surprised a button that says 'Apply changes later' does not exist, there is only a 'Save' button.</p>  <p>I have seen complicated solutions using Java on stackoverflow, but I am not familiar with UNIX or SQL, and googling brings no results.</p>  <p>Would it be a simple fix?  It wouldn't have to account for any time differences, and I'm assuming would just work off System clock; and I know Java has a calendar function that I assume works off the PC clock.</p>
