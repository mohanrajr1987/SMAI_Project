<p>I was looking over the Unix man page of write . <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/3/write" rel="nofollow">http://linux.die.net/man/3/write</a></p>  <p>In my application i will log errors, warning and process related minor information, which are written in a log file. What i want is if the file size becomes greater than 1GB , then the process should no more be able to write into that logfile . I see the man page tells about this can be achieved and write fails .</p>  <p><code>If a write() requests that more bytes be written than there is room for (for example, the process' file size limit or the physical end of a medium), only as many bytes as there is room for shall be written.</code> </p>  <p>Does this requires ulimit related changes ? I do not want to apply at server level but just process level for my application , so it unnecessary do not fill the disk size completely. Any suggestion what should i do here ? I believe solution will equally apply for C++.</p>
