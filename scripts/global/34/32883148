<p>Imagine I have some text, like 'Feef'. I can gzip it and the result is 24 bytes. Is there a way to gzip it so the result would be 1024 bytes? It should be still a valid gzip stream, i.e. it would not generate the message "trailing garbage ignored" when decompressed.</p>  <p>How would I use it: Gzip data header to fixed size. Append gzipped data body. Update header, gzip it to same fixed size and overwrite.</p>  <p>You can concatenate gzip streams and it will still be valid gzip, but they have to be proper streams. Maybe there's a way to pad gzip output?</p>
