<p>How can I commit changes to SVN repo from a unix server using jenkins? I want to create a job which commits changes every hour from the server to the svn repo.</p>  <p>I am aware of the svn publisher plugin, but that can only commit changes from a workspace. I want to commit changes from a different host. Let me know the syntax using ssh script. (or any plugins, if available)</p>
