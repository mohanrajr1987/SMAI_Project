<p>When a program is run, only certain parts of the code are actually executed. Especially when using more complex frameworks a lot of boilerplate is included with the code that never gets actually executed. </p>  <p><strong>Question:</strong> Is it possible to trace the execution of a program with the purpose of dumping only the used instructions to disk and in this way obtain a much leaner and smaller binary?</p>
