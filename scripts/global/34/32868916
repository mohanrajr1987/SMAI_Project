<p>Let's say I have two unix machines, <code>shell1</code> and <code>shell2</code> and I want to connect automatically without password from <code>user1@shell1</code> to <code>user2@shell2</code>.</p>  <p>So I execute <code>ssh-copy-id -i /home/user1/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user2@shell2</code>, confirm host adding and insert <code>user2</code> of <code>shell2</code> password and I have automatic ssh login. Good!</p>  <p>But my question is: what happens if <code>user2@shell2</code> changes password? Will the automatic login behave as before or will I have to register again <code>user1@shell1</code> against <code>user2@shell2</code>?</p>
