<p>I'm trying to get all the files from my modem via telnet using tftp. when i write tftp command i get the following message:</p>  <pre><code>BusyBox v1.6.1 (2013-07-19 18:23:03 CST) multi-call binary  Usage: tftp [OPTION]... HOST [PORT] </code></pre>  <p>BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single small executable. i wanna take advantage of that and retrieve all files that are stored in my modem's flash memory.</p>  <p>now i want to get all the files from "/" (which is the root) using tftp since i understand it has a get command but i don't know how to do it. what's the solution? is there a better way?</p>
