<p>I am attempting to take output from a command that looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>Thing ID: 1234     Object_Name = MyObject1     Object_Owner = MeMyselfAndI  Thing ID: 5678     Object_Name = MyObject2     Object_Owner = MeMyselfAndI </code></pre>  <p>and throw these collections of lines into their own elements in an array like this (where the brackets delimit an element of the array):</p>  <pre><code>MyArray =  [   Thing ID: 1234         Object_Name = MyObject1         Object_Owner = MeMyselfAndI   ] [   Thing ID: 5678         Object_Name = MyObject2         Object_Owner = MeMyselfAndI   ] </code></pre>  <p>such that retrieval of an element, like</p>  <pre><code>${MyArray[0]}) </code></pre>  <p>would result in the following:</p>  <pre><code>Thing ID: 1234     Object_Name = MyObject1     Object_Owner = MeMyselfAndI </code></pre>  <p>In other words, I'd like to use "Thing ID:" as a delimiter here (of sorts), but keep it in each of the array elements.  Is this possible in bash?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
