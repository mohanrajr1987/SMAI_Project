<p>Programming with VIM requires several plugins for most modern projects, especially when dealing large code bases. </p>  <p>To this end: </p>  <ul> <li><p>Is there a fully automated VIM environment manager, which allows you to deploy pathogen based VIM environments, on any machine, without any manual work?   If not..</p></li> <li><p>Are there any good idioms for doing this which are commonly used and which can be efficiently borrowed?</p></li> </ul>  <p>Rationale: I have lots of VIM customizations. Is there a way to sync VIM setups between machines that is elegant and well supported?  </p>  <ul> <li>Current Alternative: I tend to use a crude <code>cp -r</code> based mechanism which always manages to get out of sync.</li> </ul>
