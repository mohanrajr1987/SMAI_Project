<p>I have a homework in which my professor gave us a java program inside a directory named "example" and asked us to copy that directory to a new directory named "fixedExample." Then he asked us to rename bin/runExample to bin/runFixedExample and edit that file so that it refers to FixedExample.jar. After that we can start working on the code to fix it. </p>  <p>My problem is that I can't find a way to modify bin/fixedExample since it is a run file. </p>
