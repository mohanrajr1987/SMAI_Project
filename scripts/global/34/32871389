<p>I am installing CS-Cart software on Apache server and it does not work. I tried to follow instructions, but there is always an error: SERVICE UNAVAILABLE (as shown bellow). <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/j657W.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/j657W.png" alt="SERVICE UNAVAILABLE"></a> Before installation, we have to change permissions to this: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/BrEa3.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/BrEa3.png" alt="Permissions"></a></p>  <p>Is it right, if I changed permissions of:  - config.local.php to 666  - (directories) design, images, var to 777 Should I do anything else? Sadly, I do not have an access to terminal and I have to change it manually. </p>  <p>Thank you for your answers!</p>
