<p>Good day</p>  <p>Kindly assist, I have created  a periodic alert using Operating System Script as an action type.</p>  <p>I would like to know how can I achieve the the summary template  functionality used in MESSAGE action type:</p>  <pre><code>=**= Enter summary template below this line =**= ** =**= Enter summary template above this line =**=; </code></pre>  <p>Currently if there are three  different employee records then the alert will send three emails for each employee.Instead I would like  all employees to be listed in email.</p>  <p>The operating System Script code is as follows:</p>  <pre><code>echo 'Dear Supervisor  Employee Number :   &amp;employee_number Employee Name   :   &amp;full_name' |mutt -s "Attachment" -a /u01/ProgressReport.doc  &amp;tt  </code></pre>
