<p>Simply put: Is there a great tutorial, from start to finish, to get the simulation of your app to appear EXACTLY as you see it in the storyboard?(using xcode 6.4) No frills, straight-to-the-chase kind of thing. "Here's how you make this appear exactly as it is in storyboard". I've looked at autolayout tutorials but have yet to find one that gets straight to the point about what everyone wants to accomplish-- making it appear as you see it in storyboard. My main problem is maintaining aspect ratios across different screen sizes -- I don't want to set fixed heights on anything, I need everything to be relative. Thanks</p>
