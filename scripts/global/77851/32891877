<p>Auto layout is a pain, at least for me. All I want to do is center two labels on the same line so that they are always in the center so matter what screen it is on. </p>  <p>I want the two labels to act as one 'stack' so you can just center the stack and as a result both labels together will look like they are centered. </p>  <p>I have stacked them but I don't know how to get rid of the borders and fill, I just want to display two labels, no borders or fill. </p>  <p>I'm sure there is a way to do this without code. If there is a better way to do this without stacking please let me know!</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/RZHeM.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/RZHeM.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
