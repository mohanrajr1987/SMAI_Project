<p>I have an app that has iOS 8 as a development target and uses auto Layout from Interface Builder to position the views. all the UI is rendered correctly without any errors being thrown in the console output while running under iOS 8. </p>  <p>under iOS 9 and a left to right language the app also behaves as expected. but when I change the locale to a right to left language, the UI behaves unexpectedly also conflicting constraints errors are thrown in the console. </p>  <p>I'm suspecting the issue is related to Leading and trailing constraints but I can't find the correct way to fix it.  </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/JMfz1.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/JMfz1.png" alt="Interface builder constraints"></a></p>  <blockquote>   <p>and here's the console output on iOS 9</p> </blockquote>  <pre><code> Unable to simultaneously satisfy constraints.     Probably at least one of the constraints in the following list is one you don't want. Try this: (1) look at each constraint and try to figure out which you don't expect; (2) find the code that added the unwanted constraint or constraints and fix it.
