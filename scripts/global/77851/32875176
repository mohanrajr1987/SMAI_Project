<p>I have <code>UIView</code> that contains <code>UILabel</code> (variable text) and <code>UIImage</code> I want them to be centered inside the <code>UIView</code>. </p>  <p>The solution <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21684609/horizontally-center-uilabel-uiimageview-in-superview-using-autolayout">here</a> suggest :</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Using a container view is the simplest solution. If you create   constraints between the container view and its label and image   subviews, and you don't create any explicit width constraints on the   container or the label, then the label will size itself to fit its   content, and the container will size itself to fit its subviews. Then   you can create a horizontal center constraint between the container   and the top-level view.</p> </blockquote>  <p>But the problem is that Xcode complains and tells me to give a with and height for the container but I want it be centred dependong on the with of the <code>UILabel</code> + <code>UIImage</code></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/VgxzF.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/VgxzF.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Any other solution </p>
