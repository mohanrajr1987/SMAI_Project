<p>I have a <code>Text View</code> inside of a <code>Scroll View</code>  I want this <code>Text View</code> to expand vertically to match the content (text) that is inside. I was wondering if there is anyway to set a <code>height constraint</code> to match the <code>instrinsic</code> size of the text view. I can only see a way to set the the <code>height</code> to a constant.</p>  <p>I would prefer to be able to achieve this using the interface builder if it is possible. I tried messing around with the content hugging and stuff, but xCode just starts complaining about an ambiguous height for the <code>Scroll View</code></p>  <p>Any help or suggestions would be appreciated</p>  <p><strong>Solution:</strong> So I found out what was going wrong, I had the right idea, pinning the textview to the bottom of the scrollview and stuff, the problem was that I had <code>Scrolling Enabled ON</code> so this didn't allow the interface to calculate the <code>intrinsic size</code> which is why it was not expanding to the content.</p>
