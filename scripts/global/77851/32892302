<p>I am desperately trying to stick one of my UILabels to the right edge of it's superview while the label's width is variable (it's a time so the thing is getting bigger and should be expanding to the left, this is done using sizeToFit inside of the label when text is set).</p>  <p>So far I have tried loads of things but closest I got with:</p>  <pre><code>_elapsedTimeRightConstraint = [NSLayoutConstraint constraintWithItem:_elapsedTimeView attribute:NSLayoutAttributeRight relatedBy:NSLayoutRelationEqual toItem:self attribute:NSLayoutAttributeRight multiplier:1.0 constant:-150]; </code></pre>  <p>While the label is initially set to 150px width. But when I modify the constant, it all goes to hell.</p>  <pre><code>_elapsedTimeRightConstraint.constant = (_elapsedTimeView.frame.size.width * -1); [self layoutIfNeeded]; </code></pre>  <p>So my question is, how do I align trailing edges of a view and it's superview (so it sticks to the right) when the width of the subview is constantly changing. I have been using <code>FLKAutoLayout</code> elsewhere in the project so if this can be done this framework easily than great, but basic autolayout solution would be amazing too!!!</p>
