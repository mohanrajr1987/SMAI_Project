<p>I am in a situation where I need to check if preferredMaxLayoutWidth is set to automatic. I'm using a custom subclass of UILabel, and in that subclass, I am setting the preferredMaxLayoutWidth every time the user calls <code>layoutSubviews</code> or <code>intrinsicContentSize</code>. The issue occurs in just one of my views, on iOS 9 on an iPhone 5S or earlier, so it's a very limited issue.</p>  <p>What happens is the text gets truncated instead of word wrapping. This seems to be fixed by setting the preferredMaxLayoutWidth to automatic in the storyboard, and removing the manual setting of it in the two methods before, however, this breaks other uses of this UILabel subclass across the app. So I'd like to only set it if preferredMaxLayoutWidth is not set to automatic, otherwise I'd like to skip over setting it.</p>  <p>I've searched and searched and haven't found a good way to check if it's set to automatic. Checking if preferedMaxLayoutWidth is equal to zero was my first and only thing I've come across to try, and that didn't work.</p>  <p>I'd prefer to not subclass this subclass for just this one use-case, as this issue may pop up elsewhere across the app, it would be nice to be able to fix it by just setting this one property and having my custom subclass handle that change in properties. Any ideas on how to check if preferredMaxlayoutWidth is set to automatic or not?</p>
