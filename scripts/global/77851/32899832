<p>I am using Xcode 7.0 and Swift 2.  I am trying to get an object to move Up, Down, Left, and Right when pressing on directional buttons.  If I have auto layout on I can move the object Up and Down but cannot move left and right it just animates in place (I have no constraints on the image).  Then if I turn auto layout off the object moves as intended in all 4 directions, but then there are no constraints for my images on my other view controllers and my app only looks as intended on an iPhone 6+ because thats what my storyboard is set to.</p>  <p>Is there a way to get just 1 image to ignore the auto layout and get it to move around the screen?</p>
