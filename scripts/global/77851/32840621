<p>In my iOS app (Developing for iOS 7 and up ) I have a <code>UItableViewCell</code>that calculates it height based on the <code>auto layout constraints</code> I've set and the content of the cell. The code to that works well as for all other cells the height is correct. </p>  <p>However I have a <code>UITableViewCell</code> that only has a <code>UILabel</code> in it and this label gets its text via a web service. So its height needs to be calculated at runtime. This is how I setup the <code>constraints</code> on the <code>UITableViewCell</code>: </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/O2o08.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/O2o08.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>So as you can see I expect the <code>UITableViewCell</code> height to be based on the text within the <code>UILabel</code>. </p>  <p>At first the height was too short and my text was cut off. Only after setting <code>preferredMaxLayoutWidth</code> from Automatic to explicit did the height of the cell incase. However how it's seems the hight is too much. Here is what the <code>UITableViewCell</code> now looks like at runtime: Lots of whitespace above and below the <code>UILabel</code>.  <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/PCJ8x.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/PCJ8x.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I would really appreciate any help on this and hoping someone can tell me where I am going wrong with my constraints. </p>
