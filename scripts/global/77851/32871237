<p>For my LaunchScreen file on iPad, I simply have a UIImageView.  I have constraints set to 20 for the top, and 0 for sides and bottom.  For width and height I have >=768 set.  It was my thinking that this would keep the Image Stretched out to all edges (except for top where it would be 20 away) no matter the rotation.  Here is portrait, as expected.  What am I doing wrong?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ilNlb.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ilNlb.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>And here is Landscape</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8oDwS.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8oDwS.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Here is how I have it set up, I keep telling it 0 on leading and trailing, but it keeps going back to -20.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/6hHx6.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/6hHx6.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
