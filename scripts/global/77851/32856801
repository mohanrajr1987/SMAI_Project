<p>What is happening to my app in Xcode 7 / iOS 9?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Lbuse.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Lbuse.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>The whole screen looks condensed, as if an iPhone 4S app is displaying on an iPhone 6. It looks normal in the iPhone 4S simulator. </p>  <p>I thought it was a problem with the auto layout constraints in the main storyboard, so I eventually deleted everything apart from the root view in the root view controller (blue screen), and there's still a problem with it. </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/BICgl.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/BICgl.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I tried enabling size classes, thinking that this was the problem due to previously being disabled, but the result was the same. </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/DhYFh.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/DhYFh.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Is anyone else getting this problem in their existing apps running in iOS 9?</p>
