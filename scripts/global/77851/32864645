<p>I'd like to handle the keyboard appear/disappear behaviour leveraging on the <code>bottomLayoutGuide</code>. I've set up my whole UI through the storyboard, and the element at the bottom of the view is "constrained" to the <code>bottomLayoutGuide</code>. I want to get that constraint from my controller code, without referencing it through an IBOutlet, and substitute the constant with the keyboard height. </p>  <p>The problem that I'm encountering is that I don't find any way to recognize the right constraint. I can get the whole list of constraints from the main view, but how can I check which is the BottomLayoutGuide!?</p>  <p>I'm trying with a code like this... but it doesn't work properly (it doesn't compile at all...)</p>  <pre><code>func bottomConstraint(){     for constraint in  view.constraints{         if constraint.firstItem == bottomLayoutGuide || constraint.secondItem == bottomLayoutGuide{             ...         }     } } </code></pre>
