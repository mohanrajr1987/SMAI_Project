<p>I have a view (view 1) with another view (view 2). I am adding view 1 to window and everything was working as expected in iOS 8.  But in iOS 9, view 2 is not getting rendered properly, when view 1 is added on the window. I checked the frame of view 2, I am getting (0, -21, phone width, phone height). So autolayout contraint are not getting added to view 2. I have attached an image link for the reference. </p>  <p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/cxioam78of1tyuv/stackoverFlow.png?dl=0" rel="nofollow">https://www.dropbox.com/s/cxioam78of1tyuv/stackoverFlow.png?dl=0</a></p>
