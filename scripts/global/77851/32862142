<p>Am new to Auto layout constraints in Xcode. I have one Bottom View like <code>UITabBar</code> with 6 <code>UIButtons</code>. Without constraints I aligned those buttons with 5 space padding with each buttons and each buttons has 50 width.  Now,I am trying to make it by using Auto layout to support all Screen sizes. </p>  <blockquote>   <p>In Storyboard constrains I set equal width for 6 buttons and I made 60   space between each buttons. I set first button 0 to leading space and   I set the last button 0 to tail constraints.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I want the <code>buttons with equal width and flexible spaces</code> between views in all device sizes. </p>  <p>Can anyone pleas help me? Looking for the help. Thanks in advance.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/V8qFT.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/V8qFT.png" alt="enter image description here"></a> </p>
