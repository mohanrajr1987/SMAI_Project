<p>On iOS9, my outlet subviews don't have any superview when <code>updateViewConstraints</code> is called.</p>  <p>That practically means I can't add any constraint to them. (<code>Impossible to set up layout with view hierarchy unprepared for constraint.</code>)</p>  <p>Am I doing something wrong? Where else should I add additional constraints then?</p>
