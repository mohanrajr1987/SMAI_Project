<p>So i am having a little bit of an issue with auto layout. I am inserting a TextView into my VC and everything is normal..cursor and text start in top left hand corner. As soon as a nav bar is put into the VC, the text in the textview will lower to center on the left hand side, so basically it is just dropping it. I cant figure out what i am doing wrong, or a way to fix this. Any possible solutions? Thanks!</p>
