<p>I have a launch story board, set to work with two sets of size constraints: <em>Compact-Any</em> and <em>Regular-Any</em>.</p>  <p>All works as expected on <em>iPad</em>, <em>iPhone 6S</em>, but on other <em>iPhone</em>s the launch screen is always shown in portrait, even though the device is in landscape (i.e. the launch screen is on its side). </p>  <p>Is this a trait of earlier phones or am I doing something wrong?</p>
