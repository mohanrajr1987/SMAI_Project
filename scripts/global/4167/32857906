<p>I have recently put all my java EE projects into my google drive so i can access them on my laptop and desktop computer. Some of my projects have a database component which I have the database stored in a MySQL server. Is there a way that I can export this database and just access it from like a database file which I can store in my project file so I can use it on both my laptop and desktop computer?</p>  <p>This is really what I would like: -Be able to work on my java EE projects that have a database on both my computers  -Store my MySQL Server databases in a file which can go in my project folder then use java to access that database instead of going through the server</p>  <p>Any alternate ways of doing this would help me out this is just one way I can think of doing.</p>  <p>Note: I am using my laptop on the go so my desktop computer wont always be accessible from my laptop neither will I have an active internet connection always. Thanks</p>
