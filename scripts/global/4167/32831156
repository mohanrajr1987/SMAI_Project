<p>I am working on an Access application wherein I have plenty of reports being generated by applying filter via VBA code such as      ...     DoCmd.OpenReport reportName, acViewPreview, , Filter, , False</p>  <p>When I open a report this way it is open on Print Preview. Then, by right-clicking the report with the mouse I get a lot of options, including one menu entry for exporting:</p>  <p><em>Export > PDF</em>, or <em>Export > HTML</em>, for example.</p>  <p>Until now, every single report I open this way was exported correctly to whatever format I choose. By "correctly" I mean applying to the exported report the same filter applied to the print preview mode. </p>  <p>Today, however, one of my reports is being exported wrongly. No matter which filter I apply to it when opening in print preview mode, when I export to any format I get a report with all the records of the table (the table being reported), without the application of the filter.</p>  <p>Does any of you have any idea of why such a thing is happening to me?</p>
