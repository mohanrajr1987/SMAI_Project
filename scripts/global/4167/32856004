<p>I just updated my Xcode from version 6 to 7. Upon exporting my Mac app (targets OS X 10.10) Xcode creates a folder that has its name in the following format <code>&lt;app name YYYY-MM-DD HH-MM-SS&gt;</code>. When I try to run the app while in that folder it crashes. If I move the app outside of that folder (to the desktop for example) it works fine. This is my workaround, but I'm wondering, what causes this to occur?</p>
