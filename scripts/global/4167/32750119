<p>I have a MS SQL 2005 based database with a load of tables belonging to a particular schema. I want to export the data each of those tables to a file. I will then import each of them into another MS SQL database. I need to do a file based export/import because the 2 databases are on different networks.</p>  <p>I am using the following article as my starting point: <a href="http://blogs.lessthandot.com/index.php/datamgmt/dbprogramming/bcp-all-tables-into-files/" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.lessthandot.com/index.php/datamgmt/dbprogramming/bcp-all-tables-into-files/</a></p>  <p>However, I want to make sure that it is a 'like for like' copy and it isn't going to lose data when converting certain data types to text (e.g. numeric types).</p>  <p>The bcp -N flag seems to be the one I want (<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms189941.aspx" rel="nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms189941.aspx</a>), rather than the -c flag used in the original article. I guess I am safer using -N rather than -n in case there are extended characters within the data and I am at no disadvantage in doing so.</p>  <p>Will this give me what I want?</p>
