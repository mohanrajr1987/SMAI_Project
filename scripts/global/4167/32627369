<p>I have a Mongodb collection with the following fields that I want to export to csv:</p>  <pre><code>&gt; Object.keys(db.datas.findOne()) [         "_id",         "session",         "deviceID",         "sessionID",         "data",         "meditation",         "normalization",         "survey",         "demographic",         "__v" ] </code></pre>  <p>I am only concerned with the "data" field which has many subfields. E.g: alpha, beta, gamma, etc, where data looks something like that:</p>  <pre><code>{"data":[{"alpha":1215,"beta":674, "theta":1103},{"alpha":3094, "beta":2305,"theta":3382}]} </code></pre>  <p>What i need is all the instances of data.data.alpha from all instances and I am not sure how many "alpha" are in each data. When I try to export this to csv and use a fieldFile with data.data.0.alpha, obviously I only get the first instance of alpha for each record whereas typically I would want to get all the alpha fields in all the records. Is there any way to do that??</p>
