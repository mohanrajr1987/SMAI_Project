<p>Iam trying to export/checkout a specific revision from my repository from SVN command line. How do I get files from a specific revision, only the modified files.</p>  <p>Say, If revision#457 has 3 file modification, I need to pull only these 3 files from repository.     I tried:-</p>  <pre><code>    svn co -r 457 https://test.repo.com/branches/1.0.X     svn export --force -r 457 https://test.repo.com/branches/1.0.X ./ </code></pre>  <p>Both seems to be pulling all the files. Any help?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
