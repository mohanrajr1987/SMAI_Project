<p>I have presently bulit a parser for a input file in c++ and as the final product, i have map of 2d vectors which corresponds to value generated w.r.t to latitude and longitude.  However, i would like to export this map object to matlab, so that i can interpolate over the values and generate world maps. I am new to c++ and it sounds complex to do the above operations in it, hence i think matlab will be a solution. Please provide suggestions/solutions...</p>  <pre><code> map&lt;int,vector&lt;vector&lt;double&gt; &gt; &gt; is the object i would like to export. </code></pre>  <p>Thank you :) Lakshmi </p>
