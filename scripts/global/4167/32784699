<p>I have a script /usr/bin/test.sh which looks like that:</p>  <pre><code>test_func() {     echo "callertest 1:"     cat /proc/$PPID/cmdline | tr '\0' ' '     echo "callertest 2:"     ps aux | grep $PPID }  export -f test_func bash -c test_func </code></pre>  <p>Because "/usr/bin" is in $PATH, i call the script with "test.sh". The function should echo the script's name or better full path, but i havent got any further than getting "bash". Seems to be an issue with scripts which are placed in $PATH.</p>
