<p>I would like to be able to export the Value from each Name in the Workspace using MATLAB. </p>  <p>I have some questions, which then sets the variables in the workspace. I have tried <code>xlswrite</code> but I have been unsuccessful in being able to export the file. I don't think that it would export just the value, which I would like it to do.</p>  <pre><code>% Construct a questdlg with three options choiceprepq = 'Which animal do you like?'; choiceprep = questdlg('Which animal do you like?', 'Which animal do you like?', 'Dog', 'Cat','Fish'); % Handle response switch choiceprep case 'Dog'     disp([choiceprep ' Dog Selected.']) case 'Cat'     disp([choiceprep ' Cat Selected.']) case 'Fish'     disp([choiceprep ' Fish Selected.']) end  alldata= whos('global'); filename='Test.xls'; xlswrite(filename,alldata) </code></pre>  <p>Is there any way to export the question and the value which the user selects from the question boxes as an Excel file? Not the name of the variable, <code>choiceprep</code>, but its value.</p>  <p>An example in this case would be: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Z4cF2.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Z4cF2.png" alt="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Z4cF2.png"></a></p>
