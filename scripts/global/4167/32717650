<p>I'm using; DOORS client 9.6.1.0 and DOORS server 9.2.0.0.</p>  <p>The problem; An export of a partition file I made last week is no longer shown in the Exported Partitions view on my DOORS client. Therefore I cant synchronise or rejoin it.</p>  <p>I'm wondering if there is a problem using the slightly older server with the newer DOORS client, although the IBM help says it should be compatible.</p>  <p>Does anyone have a workaround?</p>  <p>Kind Regards, Chris</p>
