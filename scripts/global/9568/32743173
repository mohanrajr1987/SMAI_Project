<p>I am working on an asp.net mvc-5 web application. and i want the same user to be able to send a maximum of 5 contact us forms each hour.</p>  <p>so i need to know what is the best way to determine if the request i am receiving is comming from the same user or not. now i am planning to store all the requests when a submit form action method is called, and before submitting to check if the request is coming from a user who have already submitted 5 requests . but which parameter inside the Request is the most reliable one to depend on ?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
