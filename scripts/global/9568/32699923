<p>When i was using normal servlet using doGet and doPost it was easy to parse the request headers, but i moved to this kind of web services where for me it is better because of the parameters in the methods.</p>  <pre><code>@POST     @Path("/sumPost")     @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)     public String sumPost(@QueryParam(value = "x") int x,             @QueryParam(value = "y") int y) {         System.out.println("x = " + x);         System.out.println("y = " + y);         return (x + y) + "\n";     } </code></pre>  <p>however in this method there is no <code>request</code> parameter to parse the request headers. I would like to ask how can i parse the request http headers. For example to know the user agent or the content type accepted or the operating system </p>  <p>thanks</p>
