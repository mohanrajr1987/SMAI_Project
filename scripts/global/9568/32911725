<p>I was writing a test HTML form locally, invoking a distant webpage in the <code>action</code> field.  However I figured that though set as POST, the form would only send GET data.  I moved it on the distant server, but it behaved the same way.  Then I changed the absolute URL to a relative one and it worked.</p>  <p>Is it expected, or is there some server setting to change this behaviour ?</p>  <p>Here is an almost minimal form reproducing the issue :</p>  <pre><code>&lt;form action="http://example.com/foobar.php" method="post"&gt;   &lt;input type="text" name="blah"&gt;   &lt;input type="submit" value="Submit"&gt; &lt;/form&gt; </code></pre>  <p>For testing purposes foobar.php could contain</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php echo $_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD']; ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Edit : There <em>must</em> be something wrong with my setup, since I can find loads of similar and supposedly working samples on the web (and actually this is what I am supposed to achieve at the end).</p>
