<p>This might be a very trivial questions, but I couldn't find any Specific question on SO. </p>  <p>I have developed an RESTful API using Jersey. I tested this on the localhost and it works fine. Now I thew it onto the RPi and tested it locally it works fine. </p>  <p>When I try to access this same API from my mac it gives me an error of could not connect to the webservice. </p>  <p>During my local test I used the URL: </p>  <p><a href="http://localhost:8080/healthyhome/" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8080/healthyhome/</a><strong>webresource/myresources</strong></p>  <p>Now to access the same service I use Yaler Tunnel to take of my firewall and make a tunnel through it. </p>  <p>I call the service on PORT:8080 same as tomcat. When I'm listen to the port it shows me the incoming POST request with form-data that I passed. </p>  <p>But when I run the tomcat it does not. </p>  <p>I send request to the URL:</p>  <p>http://********.try.yaler.net/<strong>webresource/myresources</strong></p>  <p>What do you think I'm doing wrong. </p>
