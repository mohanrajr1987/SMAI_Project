<p>I have a form with POST method. if i click on submit button it submits as POST and even if i reload the page its working fine but weird thing is when i click in address bar and hit enter it submits as GET instead of POST. I am not able to understand this behaviour Browser - Chrome. server - tomcat 7</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
