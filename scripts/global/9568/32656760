<p>First, I asked this question <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32653838/what-did-i-miss-to-send-a-http-part-post-request">What did I miss to send a http part post request</a> and it seems i didn't understand the logic of sending multipart from a client to a server. Using this post <a href="https://developer.constantcontact.com/docs/mylibrary-files-api/file-add-multipart-post.html" rel="nofollow">https://developer.constantcontact.com/docs/mylibrary-files-api/file-add-multipart-post.html</a> I was able t see the required fields in each part.</p>  <p>I build my request and added all the required fields as you see here</p>  <pre><code>HttpClient client = HttpClientBuilder.create().build();         HttpPost httpPost = new HttpPost(                 "http://localhost:8080/ServletExample1/multipart1");         httpPost.addHeader("Content-Type",                 "multipart/related; boundary=HereItGoes");         httpPost.addHeader("Accept", MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN);         MultipartEntityBuilder builder = MultipartEntityBuilder.create();         FileBody bin = new FileBody(new File("./test.txt"));         builder.addPart("source", new StringBody("MyComputer",                 ContentType.TEXT_PLAIN));         builder.addPart("folder_id", new StringBody("-1",                 ContentType.TEXT_PLAIN));         builder.addPart("file_type", new StringBody("txt",                 ContentType.TEXT_PLAIN));         builder.addPart("file_name", new StringBody("test.txt",                 ContentType.TEXT_PLAIN));         builder.addPart("description", new StringBody("The file to test",                 ContentType.TEXT_PLAIN));         builder.addPart("data", bin);         HttpEntity entity = builder.build();         httpPost.setEntity(entity);         HttpResponse response = client.execute(httpPost);         String responseString = new BasicResponseHandler()                 .handleResponse(response);         System.out.println(responseString); </code></pre>  <p>my problem is in the server, i keep receive that the number of the parts is zero. for somewho the server is not receiving the parts (note i am not saying there is exceptions in the server)</p>  <p>I am saying this because on the server (my servlet) i do this</p>  <pre><code>Iterator&lt;Part&gt; partsIterator = request.getParts().iterator();             System.out.println("The number of parts is :"                     + request.getParts().size()); </code></pre>  <p>and the result of the printing is always zero, always</p>  <p>what am i missing please?</p>
