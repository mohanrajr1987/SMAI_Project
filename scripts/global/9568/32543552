<p>I am required to post variables to a website API using JSON format. After some research and using a test post server I came up with this string:</p>  <pre><code>curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"id":"value"}' http://posttestserver.com/post.php  Successfully dumped 0 post variables. View it at http://www.posttestserver.com/data/2015/09/12/09.46.20574590076 Post body was 12 chars long. </code></pre>  <p>However no variables are parsed from the string (it should find the variable "id" in this case). Instead everything is put into the post body.</p>  <p>The full post request can be seen at the given address:</p>  <pre><code>Time: Sat, 12 Sep 15 09:46:20 -0700 Source ip: 178.112.221.72  Headers (Some may be inserted by server) HTTP_CONNECTION = close REQUEST_URI = /post.php QUERY_STRING =  REQUEST_METHOD = POST GATEWAY_INTERFACE = CGI/1.1 REMOTE_PORT = 53709 REMOTE_ADDR = 178.112.221.72 CONTENT_LENGTH = 12 CONTENT_TYPE = application/json HTTP_ACCEPT = */* HTTP_USER_AGENT = curl/7.43.0 HTTP_HOST = posttestserver.com UNIQUE_ID = VfRW3NBx6hIAAHNyJToAAAAK REQUEST_TIME_FLOAT = 1442076380.6991 REQUEST_TIME = 1442076380  No Post Params.  == Begin post body == '{id:value}' == End post body ==  Upload contains PUT data: '{id:value}' </code></pre>  <p>Here the data appears both in "post body" and under PUT. But again no post parameters are listed.</p>  <p>Am I doing something wrong? Is it at all possible to post variables using JSON (the way you would by using <code>id=value&amp;id2=value2</code> with <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>)?</p>  <p>PS I found a similar post (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20464354/how-to-post-with-curl-to-rest-json-service">how to post with curl to REST/JSON service?</a>), there it depends on the server. But in my case by using this test server I should see the actual "raw" request (quoting from posttestserver.com </p>  <blockquote>   <p>"Thus, I've put together a simple service which will dump the contents   of an* HTTP POST to a file which can be viewed at leisure."</p> </blockquote>  <p>).</p>
