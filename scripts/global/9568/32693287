<p>I am sending a multipart request from my client to my server like this:</p>  <pre><code>FileBody file2 = new FileBody(new File("./test2.txt")); FileBody image1 = new FileBody(new File("./DSC_0064.JPG")); </code></pre>  <p>and as you see, one of the files is txt, and one if JPG image.</p>  <p>On the server, I receive the request and I take the headers for each part, and I get this:</p>  <pre><code>------------Part 1------------ content-disposition=form-data; name="test2"; filename="test2.txt" content-type=application/octet-stream content-transfer-encoding=binary ------------Part 2------------ content-disposition=form-data; name="image1"; filename="DSC_0064.JPG" content-type=application/octet-stream content-transfer-encoding=binary </code></pre>  <p>As you see, the content type for both of them is <code>application/octet-stream</code>. How to determine in the dynamic environment the actual type? Is it an image? a text? a video?</p>  <p>I can't depend on the file name because the user can change it for example from txt to png and then my server will think that it is an image but he will exception because of that.</p>
