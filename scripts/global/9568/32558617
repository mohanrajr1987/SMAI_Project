<p>I am using RPC with HTTP 'post' methods to provide API services. where I am doing like </p>  <pre><code>def device_call   case params['method']   when "login"     redirect_to api_sessions_login_path params   when "logout"     redirect_to api_sessions_logout_path params   when "forgot_password"     redirect_to api_sessions_forgot_password_path params   else     render_json_fail "Method name not found.", 401   end end </code></pre>  <p>where I am accepting 'method' attribute and accordingly redirecting to that method of different controller.</p>  <p>Am I doing it in correct way or is there any other way to implement RPC-JSON post requests?</p>
