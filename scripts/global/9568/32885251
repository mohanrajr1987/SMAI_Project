<p>I want to know the difference between sending data in bulk vs making multiple POST request to send the data. For eg:-</p>  <p>I've an endpoint <code>/data</code>. I want to know the difference between sending data as one API call, ie posting data in a list</p>  <pre><code>[     {'key1':value1,'key2':value2,'key3':value3},     {'key1':value11,'key2':value21,'key3':value31},     {'key1':value12,'key2':value22,'key3':value32},     {'key1':value13,'key2':value23,'key3':value33}, ] </code></pre>  <p>vs making multiple calls on the endpoint <code>/data</code>, in this case 4 calls sending data one by one.</p>
