<p>I am using the below code and sometimes in production(which I couldn't replicate in dev) there is an object reference error on the line highlighted below. My code is checking whether my formcollection is null and only then it is being iterated over. However sometimes while the formcollection is being iterated, we are getting a object reference error? Have anyone came across this scenario? I am not able to replicate this scenario in Development environment.</p>  <pre><code>[HttpPost]  public ActionResult Someaction(FormCollection formCollection) {         if (formCollection == null)          {             return RedirectToAction("Index", "Home");         }          if (ModelState.IsValid)         {              ***foreach (string key in formCollection.AllKeys)//This is the error line***             {             } } } </code></pre>
