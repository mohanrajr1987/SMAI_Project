<p>I'm looking at the documentation for baked queries and it isn't obvious to me how I would accomplish subqueries or ctes using baked queries. In other words, it doesn't appear possible to create a baked query and then select from it using another baked query.</p>  <p>I see there is the undocumented function _as_query which converts it to a regular query, but once you do that I don't see a way to have another baked query select from it unless you implement some sort of caching system based on the values input into the subquery, which pretty much defeats the purpose of baking the first query in the first place.</p>  <p>edit: Actually, _as_query bypasses all caching so using it defeats the purpose of the bakery.</p>
