<p>I have a Flask application and a MySQL database. I would like to have a search box which searches my database. I heard of Flask-WhooshSQLAlchemy and found the <a href="http://pythonhosted.org/Flask-WhooshAlchemy/" rel="nofollow">documentation</a> which says to add this to my SQLAlchemy models file:</p>  <pre><code># set the location for the whoosh index app.config['WHOOSH_BASE'] = 'path/to/whoosh/base' </code></pre>  <p>For a MySQL database, what would you need to put for <code>WHOOSH_BASE</code>? If I had a SQLite database, I would just put the database location but as it is a MySQL database, I can't. What should I do? Thanks.</p>
