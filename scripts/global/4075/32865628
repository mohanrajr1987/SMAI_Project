<p>I have a table which has columns - <code>id(int)</code>, <code>date(DateTime)</code>, <code>value(float)</code>. I wanted to output daily average group by date of all rows which has <code>id=2.</code> </p>  <p>I wrote following sql query for that and query was working fine:</p>  <pre><code>select cast(date as date), avg(value) from table where id=2 group by cast(date as date) </code></pre>  <p>For the same problem, if I wanted to execute in sqlalchemy, I was using following expression :</p>  <pre><code>&gt;&gt; from sqlalchemy import sql, types &gt;&gt; x = sql.cast(Table.date, types.Date) </code></pre>  <p>But when I tried executing x, I got following error :</p>  <pre><code>&gt;&gt; x.execute()     ArgumentError: Not an executable clause: CAST(Table.date AS DATETIME) </code></pre>  <p>which means that SQL Server is considering that <code>types.Date as DateTime</code>. </p>  <p>Is there any way so that I can convert DateTime to Date in sqlalchemy?</p>
