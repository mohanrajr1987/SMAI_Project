<p>MySQL table space tends to increase for large deletions.</p>  <p>I am currently doing:</p>  <pre><code>s = session.query(model) s.delete() </code></pre>  <p>I understand that I can add </p>  <pre><code>s.limit(1000) </code></pre>  <p>and <code>sleep</code> after each deletion and re-querying <code>s.all()</code> to determine if all the entries have been wiped. Is there a way to just say delete in batches of <code>1000</code> until all the original records have been cleaned out?</p>
