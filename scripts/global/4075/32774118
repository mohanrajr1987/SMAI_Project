<p>I'm working with Flask on building a Bootstrap table out of a list of people taken from a SQLAlchemy database. However, the information I want to put in the table is appearing above it.</p>  <p>Here's the code in question:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;  {% extends "base.html" %}  {% block page_content %} &lt;div class="page-header"&gt;     &lt;h1&gt;componentes familiares&lt;/h1&gt;         &lt;table class="table"&gt;             &lt;thead&gt;                 &lt;th&gt;name&lt;/th&gt;                 &lt;th&gt;age&lt;/th&gt;                 &lt;th&gt;option&lt;/th&gt;             &lt;/thead&gt;             &lt;tbody&gt;                 {% for person in people %}                     &lt;tr&gt;{{ person.name }}&lt;/tr&gt;                     &lt;tr&gt;{{ person.age }}&lt;/tr&gt;                     &lt;tr&gt;{{ person.option }}&lt;/tr&gt;                 {% endblock %}             &lt;/tbody&gt;         &lt;/table&gt; {% endblock %} </code></pre>  <p>(This is already a slimmed-down version, since I kept taking stuff off to see if it would solve the problem.)</p>  <p>But let's say I have two persons in my database, Alice, and Bob. Alice is 30 and Bob is 40, Alice's option is 1 and Bob's is 2. This is what I get:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/xalTe.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/xalTe.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>The information is there, but it's rendered above the table. And right below it comes the table header and an empty table row.</p>  <p><strong>Links</strong></p>  <p>I found another question about Bootstrap tables in Flask <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13315883/how-to-structure-data-to-easily-build-html-tables-in-flask">here</a>, but it didn't really solve my problem. My data is being passed to the html page exactly as I want it, I just want to put it in a table.</p>  <p>I also found <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Flask-Table" rel="nofollow">Flask-Table</a>, an extension to build the table in Python and then using it. It may end up being a solution, but I still don't see what's wrong with my code.</p>  <p>Didn't find anything useful in the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#tables" rel="nofollow">Bootstrap docs</a> either.</p>  <p>Any help greatly appreciated!</p>
