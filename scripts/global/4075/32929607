<p>I could not find a question/answer on this specifically. Apologize if it is a dup. </p>  <p>I am using scoped_sessions from SQLAlchemy(to MySQL) and running the sql commit inside tornado's threadpool. In my unit test, the first time Session.commit() passes but the second Session.commit() hangs. I am closing the session properly after the first time commit. I enabled sqlalchemy logging and I can see that there is nothing emitted after INSERT INTO ... for the second commit. </p>  <p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
