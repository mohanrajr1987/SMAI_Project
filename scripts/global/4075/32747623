<p>I figured I could find answer to this on the internet somewhere, but I seem to have missed it. You can query a table for all rows where an array column contains a specific value:</p>  <pre><code>MyModel.query.filter(Mymodel.arrayField.contains(['someValue']) </code></pre>  <p>And you can put in multiple values such that the array must contain <strong>all</strong> the specified values:</p>  <pre><code>MyModel.query.filter(Mymodel.arrayField.contains(['someValue', 'anotherValue']) </code></pre>  <p>But what about querying and where the array contains <strong>at-least one</strong> of the specified values.  That is, a query that would return rows where <code>arrayField</code> contains <code>'someValue'</code> or <code>'anotherValue'</code>, and maybe both but not necessarily both.</p>  <p>How would I do that?</p>
