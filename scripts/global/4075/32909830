<p>I used SqlAlchemy to manage the database. However, there is one thing frustrating.</p>  <p>I decided to extends others method. However, there are change of object in the code. But I only want to commit the specific column. How to avoid that?</p>  <p>Fot example.</p>  <pre><code>f=db.session.query(form).filter(form.ID=="12").first(); #other's code f.a=1 #my code f.b=100 #but it will also change the a column! db.session.commit() </code></pre>  <p>is there a good way to solve it? I need to hold it in the same session.</p>
