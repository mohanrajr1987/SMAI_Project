<p>I'm building a project that involves a list of people and the transactions they've made. Each person will have their own profile with x amount of transactions. </p>  <p>My database, so far, consists of two models:</p>  <p>One to define a person</p>  <pre><code>class Person (models.Model):     """     A person     """      id = models.AutoField(primary_key=True)     name = models.CharField(max_length=100, blank=True)      def __unicode__(self):         return self.name </code></pre>  <p>One to associate a transaction each person made.</p>  <pre><code>class Purchase (models.Model):     """     A purchase for each person     """     person_id = models.ForeignKey(Person)     purchase_description = models.CharField(max_length=1000, blank=True) </code></pre>  <p>I determined this would be a many-to-one database relationship because some people might make the same transaction.</p>  <p>Now, I can make pages for each person, showing their name in the header. What I'd like to do is show the transactions made to that particular person. How can this be done? Here's what my view.py file looks like:</p>  <pre><code>from django.shortcuts import render from .models import Person, Purchase  def load_person(request, name):      person = Person.objects.get(name=name)      # name = Purchase.objects.filter(purchase)      context = {         'name': name         # 'purchase': purchase     }      return render(request, 'pages/person.html', context) </code></pre>  <p>Here's the url associated to the query in my url.py file.</p>  <pre><code>url(r'^project/(?P&lt;name&gt;[-\w]+)/$', views.load_person),  </code></pre>
