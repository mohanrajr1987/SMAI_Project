<p>We are working on a big data model redesign project. In this project one of the models is changing from an actual table to an abstract model. When I work on the redesign branch and run the new migrations, then go back to a branch that still uses the older model, the migrations don't revert or reset? </p>  <p>I get an error from the ModelSerializer:</p>  <pre><code>File "/home/vagrant/.virtualenvs/chalktalk/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/rest_framework/serializers.py", line 198, in __init__ self.fields = self.get_fields() File "/home/vagrant/.virtualenvs/chalktalk/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/rest_framework/serializers.py", line 234, in get_fields   default_fields = self.get_default_fields() File "/home/vagrant/.virtualenvs/chalktalk/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/rest_framework/serializers.py", line 670, in get_default_fields while pk_field.rel and pk_field.rel.parent_link: </code></pre>  <h2>AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'rel'</h2>  <p>I tried dropping the database and recreating it and that doesn't fix it. I feel like this is something that live in the local memory cache for django and it is not reseting when i go back to master or a branch that uses the current model which does not have an abstract model.</p>
