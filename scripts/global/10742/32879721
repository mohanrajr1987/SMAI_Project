<p>I have a django project in which I have not created any app, I directly wrote models for the project in models.py file inside project folder. But whenever I perform </p>  <pre><code>python manage makemigrations </code></pre>  <p>it says : No changes detected</p>  <p>so when I perform</p>  <pre><code>python manage migrate  </code></pre>  <p>it says :   No migrations to apply.</p>  <p>So is there any different way to perform migrations if you are directly writing your models without creating any App for django project</p>
