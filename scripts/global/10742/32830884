<p>I am writing a django web app that models an application where hospital staff and patients can login. The patients, nurses, and doctors all have different permissions and the models need to store different information. I am currently trying to create a user profile model that holds all the common fields, and then create separate models for each type of employee that each have a oneToOneField(UserProfile) attribute. I was wondering how I could tell which type of user was logged in from my views.py file. For example, is it possible to do something like:</p>  <pre><code>    if request.user.is_patient():         show patient form     elif request.user.is_doctor:         show doctor form </code></pre>  <p>Here is what I have in models.py so far:</p>  <pre><code>class BaseUser(models.Model):     user = models.OneToOneField(User)     username = models.CharField(max_length=30)     firstName = models.CharField(max_length=50)     middleName = models.CharField(max_length=50)     lastName = models.CharField(max_length=50)     sex = models.CharField(max_length=10)     address = models.CharField(max_length=200)     email = models.CharField(max_length=50)     phone = models.CharField(max_length=10)  User.profile = property(lambda u: BaseUser.objects.get_or_create(user=u)[0])  class PatientUser(models.Model):     user = models.OneToOneField(BaseUser)     existingConditions = models.TextField()     prescriptions = models.TextField() </code></pre>
