<p>I have the following function...</p>  <pre><code>def DoStuffWithModelInstance(model_instance):     name = model_instance.name     model = apps.get_model(name, name) </code></pre>  <p>Where model_instance is a parameter I am passing in that holds two values, name and description.</p>  <p>The name value is the name of another Model. When I use </p>  <pre><code>apps.get_model(name, name) </code></pre>  <p>I get an error saying that the app_label does not exist....</p>  <p>However, if I type out the app_label like soo....</p>  <pre><code>apps.get_model('some_app_label', name) </code></pre>  <p>It works...  How can I make it so I can pass in the app_label with a variable?</p>
