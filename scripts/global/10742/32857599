<p>it would be great if I could have your opinion, apologies I am fairly new to Django and struggling on how to model this relationship. Basically I have a series of courses</p>  <pre><code>class Course(models.Model):     title = models.CharField(max_length=128)     track = models.ForeignKey(Track,verbose_name="Learning track", default=1, null=True, blank=True)     description = models.CharField(max_length = 240, null=True, blank=True)     slug = models.SlugField(max_length = 100, null=True, blank=True, unique= True) </code></pre>  <p>and in a course we have lectures:</p>  <pre><code>class Lecture(models.Model):     title = models.CharField(max_length=128)     course = models.ForeignKey(Course,verbose_name="Lecture Course", default=1,blank=True)     description = models.CharField(max_length = 240, null=True, blank=True)     tags = GenericRelation("TaggedItem", null=True, blank=True) </code></pre>  <p>My question is what is the best way to model each of the items completion by a particular user, allowing to express things such as: "user A has completed 50% of lecture 1"  <em>and</em> "user A has completed 80% of course ABC"</p>  <p>What I had in mind is using contenttypes for this but not sure it is the best approach from a data modelling perspective - any advice or ideas you could provide would be greatly appreciated!</p>  <p>Thanks in Advance!</p>
