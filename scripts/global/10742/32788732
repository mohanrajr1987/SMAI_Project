<p>I have a checkbox choice field like this:</p>  <pre><code>models.py TYPE_CHOICES = (        ('s', 'small'),        ('m', 'medium'),        ('b', 'big'),      ) class Post(models.Model) :     size = models.CharField(blank=True,max_length="3", choices=TYPE_CHOICES) </code></pre>  <p>So in the admin form:</p>  <pre><code>class MainContent(forms.ModelForm):     size = forms.MultipleChoiceField(choices=TYPE_CHOICES, widget=forms.CheckboxSelectMultiple())     class Meta:         model = Post         fields = '__all__' </code></pre>  <p>But when I saving the form it give me this error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Select a valid choice. ['s', 'm', 'b'] is not one of the available   choices.</p> </blockquote>  <p>So, what is the problem?</p>  <h2>UPDATE</h2>  <p>My apology, this question was not given enough info, let me explain more. </p>  <p>The reason I want a checkbox input is because I want it able to store multiple values in the single field (one column). Perhaps the data can be serialized (or comma separated),  </p>  <p>Since the TYPE_CHOICES is static and will not changed in the future, I am not planning to use ManytoMany.</p>  <p>Also I want it able to display in the template easily by the language language. </p>  <p>Hope this is clear enough. </p>
