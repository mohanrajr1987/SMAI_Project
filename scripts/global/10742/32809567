<p>I am fairly new to django rest framework. I have these tables in my database:</p>  <p>1) <strong>MainCategroies</strong> - which stores a list of all education fields.</p>  <p>2) <strong>College</strong> - which stores list of all college of my state.</p>  <p>3) <strong>CollegeCategoryLink</strong> -  which stores the link between colleges and the categories to which they belong( here same college can fall under multiple categories). <i> created a model with two foreign-key column</i></p>  <p>4) <strong>Users</strong> - the users of my app.</p>  <p>5) <strong>UserCategoryLink</strong> - link between the users and their selected categories.<i> created a model with two foreign-key column</i></p>  <p>6) <strong>UserCollegeLink</strong> - link between the users and their selected colleges.<i> created a model with two foreign-key column</i></p>  <blockquote>   <p>Now the users will select their preferable categories from the list   and that will be stored in my database and then i will return the   related colleges back. All the data will come in json format from my   ionic app.</p> </blockquote>  <p>i have written serializers for each model and created viewsets for CRUD operations. Now i am confused, how to store the data through viewset methods? I am currently doing this:</p>  <pre><code>class UserCategoryLinkViewset(viewsets.ViewSet):     serializer_class = UserCategoryLinkSerializer      def create(self, request):       selectedCats = []       collegeList = []       data = JSONParser().parse(request)       for field in data:          selectedCats.append(field['cat'])          ucl = UserCategoryLink()          ucl.user = collegeAppUser.objects.get(id=field['user'])          ucl.cat = MainCategories.objects.get(id=field['cat'])          if not UserCategoryLink.objects.filter(user=field['user'], cat=field['cat']).exists():             ucl.save()        for cats in selectedCats:          queryset = CollegeCategoryLink.objects.filter(category_id=cats)          serializer = CollegeCategoryLinkSerializer(queryset, many=True)          for clg in serializer.data:             queryset_college = College.objects.filter(id=clg['college_id'])             serializer_college = CollegeSerializer(queryset_college, many=True)             collegeList.append(serializer_college.data)      return JSONResponse(collegeList) </code></pre>  <p>But this is not the correct way to accomplish what i need to do as i am directly setting the data in my model and saving it, no use of serializer in here. I want to store the data through serializer rather then directly using my model.</p>
