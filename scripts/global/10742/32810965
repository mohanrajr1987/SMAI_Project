<p>Using django 1.7.5, I made changes to User_Profile by adding a field:</p>  <pre><code>school = models.CharField(max_length = 255, blank=True, default="") </code></pre>  <p>Then, </p>  <pre><code>$ python manage.py makemigrations  </code></pre>  <p>No problem. It added the field. Next,</p>  <pre><code>$ python manage.py migrate </code></pre>  <p>gives me:</p>  <pre><code>django.db.utils.IntegrityError: mathbreakers_userprofile__new.school may not be NULL </code></pre>  <p>Uh oh. Well, after trying different things by making the field <code>default=""</code> or <code>blank=True</code>, nothing works. Forget it, I deleted the field and reverted the model to the way it was when everything worked fine. Model looks like it did before, and I run makemigrations, it removes the field (it says). Great!</p>  <p>However,</p>  <pre><code>$ python manage.py migrate </code></pre>  <p>still results in the SAME error, complaining about the field I added and then deleted.  It's as if I can't make django forget that that field exists. But it doesn't exist in my models.py file. How do I fix this? Where is that field? Is it in my SqlLite that I should go in and delete it manually from there?</p>  <p>NOTE: I have manually deleted broken migration files and also reverted to a previous GIT version before the changes. Nothing has worked, <code>python manage.py migrate</code> seems to still be broken..</p>
