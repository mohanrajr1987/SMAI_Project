<p>Django Rest Framework serializers do not call the <code>Model.clean</code> when validating model serializers. The explanation given is that this leads to 'cleaner separation of concerns', <a href="http://www.django-rest-framework.org/topics/3.0-announcement/" rel="nofollow">from the Django Rest Framework 3.0 release notes</a>: </p>  <blockquote>   <h2>Differences between ModelSerializer validation and ModelForm.</h2>      <p>This change also means that we no longer use the <code>.full_clean()</code> method   on model instances, but instead perform all validation explicitly on   the serializer. This gives a cleaner separation, and ensures that   there's no automatic validation behavior on ModelSerializer classes   that can't also be easily replicated on regular Serializer classes.</p> </blockquote>  <p>But <strong>what</strong> concerns are the authors of Django Rest Framework attempting to separate? </p>  <hr>  <p>My guess is that they're saying that a model instance should not be concerned about it's own validity. If that's the case I don't understand why.</p>
