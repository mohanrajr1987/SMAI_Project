<p>I'm trying to transfer this very simplified query to Django models:</p>  <pre><code>select B.value from A join B on A.id = B.id where B.param = "foo" group by B.value; </code></pre>  <p>Basically giving me unique <code>B.value</code> of rows with common <code>id</code></p>  <p>My models in Django are:</p>  <pre><code>#A id = CharField() ...  #B id = CharField() param = CharField() value = CharField() ... </code></pre>  <p>From what I've read, people are against <em>joining</em> tables in Django. How does my query translate to Django in simplest form?</p>  <p>I'm almost willing to just execute this query using <code>django.db.connection</code> but I'd rather not</p>
