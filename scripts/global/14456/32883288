<p>I have a vb.net program which processes some data and user input and then uses R.net to set this information into R objects and run R scripts on these objects.</p>  <p>My problem is that this is hard for me to debug, as the error messages that bubble back up through the Visual Studio debugger about the R scripts are often not helpful. </p>  <p>My latest solution to this is to add </p>  <pre><code>engine.Evaluate("save.image('Scripts/debugging/image.RData')") </code></pre>  <p>into my vb.net code just before the script that has an error. This allows me to load up the objects in my R IDE and check if everything is in the form I expect it to be.</p>  <p>I was wondering if there was a better way to do this? For instance I wonder is it possible to set up the R environment/engine to run a <code>save.image()</code> if an error is encountered automatically?</p>
