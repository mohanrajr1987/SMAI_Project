<p>I'm developing an ArcGIS add-in (don't worry, this is not a GIS question!) and wondered if there was an easier way to increment the version number.</p>  <p>At the moment, you have to edit the AssemblyVersion in AssemblyInfo.cs in both the project and the unit test project, the Config.esriaddinx (an XML file containing add-in details), and we have a config JSON file that contains a version too. So that's four places to change the version number. I know that you can use environment variables like $(VERSION) in code, but this doesn't work in AssemblyInfo.cs because version must be a constant. Also it's unlikely to work in project XML and JSON files.</p>  <p>Is the best approach a pre-build batch script that does a regex find and replace? Or just a script I can run from the commandline outside of visual studio. This is probably what I'll end up doing.</p>
