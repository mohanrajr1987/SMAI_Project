<p>I am using VS 2010. When I clean the solution the dll is disappearing from the bin\debug folder and 'COPY Local' is automatically set to False. When I rebuild the solution, the dll is showing up in that folder and 'Copy Local' attribute is still set to False.</p>  <p>How to make the dll should present in the bin\debug folder always. And the 'Copy Local' attribute  set to True.</p>
