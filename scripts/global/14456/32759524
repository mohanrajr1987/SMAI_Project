<p>I have just set up visual studio on a new computer, the only problem is that I am having trouble converting the projects from 2010 onwards giving me conversion errors.</p>  <p>Secondly we have dynamic urls and it is erroring because its not got a phicical file that it is pointing to as they are dynamic, what do I need to install to get it working? Thank you!</p>
