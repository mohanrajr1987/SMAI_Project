<p>I have an enum as below:</p>  <pre><code>enum myFilter {     myFilter_None = 0,      myFilter_Line = 1,      myFilter_ArcCCW = 2,      myFilter_ArcCW = 4,      myFilter_Circle = 8,      myFilter_Arc = myFilter_ArcCCW | myFilter_ArcCW,      myFilter_ALL = myFilter_Line | myFilter_Arc | myFilter_Circle }; </code></pre>  <p>This compiles fine in VS 2010. When I ported the same to VS 2013, I get this error.</p>  <pre><code>IntelliSense: expression must have a constant value </code></pre>  <p>The error is thrown for the <code>|</code> in <code>myFilter_Arc</code> and <code>myFilter_ALL</code>.<br/> Though the linking is successful, as it is only Intellisense error, I would like to resolve this.  Am I doing something wrong?  </p>
