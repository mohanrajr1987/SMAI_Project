<p>When I deploy my application, I'm getting the following error:</p>  <pre><code>**Parser Error Message:** The resource object with key 'Help' was not found. Source File: /Authenticate/Controls.ctlLogin.ascx </code></pre>  <p>I've searched the web, and see that usually the error is because of missing default resources or build configuration issues.</p>  <p>My problem is that this was working fine until my latest deployment. Neither the resource 'Help' nor the ctlLogin.ascx page have been changed in this sprint.</p>  <p>What was changed was: 1. Added a new page, which means a new code file in the compiled dll 2. I accidentally dropped a different .sln file in this project directory. I did a few builds before noticing this, then deleted what I accidentally copied.</p>  <p>If I use a resources.dll from the previous sprint, I get past this error. But then when I navigate to the page I added in this sprint, I get the same error except with 'SharePoint_Upload' missing (as expected).</p>  <p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
