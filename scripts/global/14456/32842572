<p>I am working on a project which is on Visual Source Safe(VSS). Me and my colleague were working on the same file. I am working in Visual Studio 2010 with VSS 2005, while my colleague was working in VIsual studio 2013 with VSS 2006.</p>  <p>My colleague committed her changes with no errors, but when I tried to get latest version of the file I am getting this error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Cannot be merged because visual source safe doesn't support merging of   files with different encoding</p> </blockquote>  <p>The option that worked earlier for such an error is completely deleteing a file from local drive (of course keeping a backup copy!), and then recreating the file from visual studio &amp; copy pasting the content from backup file.</p>  <p>But I am sure there will be some way out as the method I followed earlier doesn't seem to be the best practice.</p>  <p>Also, I cannot check in file; same error arises.</p>  <p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
