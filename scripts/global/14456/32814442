<p>I just started OpenGL with Visual Studio 2010 and this is my first project that I have compiled but I got Unresolved External problems. I have searched google and this website but I cant seem to pinpoint the problem. Thus I have come here for help. I have attached the links to the Project Properties(Linker,Additional Libraries etc) that are required from the tutorial I am viewing. Here is the code, I am not done with it.</p>  <pre><code>//GLEW  #define GLEW_STATIC #include &lt;C:\Users\Pdas002\Desktop\FOLDERS\Directories\Include\glew.h&gt; //GLFW #include &lt;C:\Users\Pdas002\Desktop\FOLDERS\Directories\Include\glfw3.h&gt; #include &lt;iostream&gt;   int main() { glfwInit(); //GIVES HINTS FOR THE WINDOW, HINTS ARE LIKE PROPERTIES THAT CAN BE CHANGED BY CALLING THE CHANGE. glfwWindowHint(GLFW_CONTEXT_VERSION_MAJOR, 3); glfwWindowHint(GLFW_CONTEXT_VERSION_MINOR, 3); glfwWindowHint(GLFW_OPENGL_PROFILE, GLFW_OPENGL_CORE_PROFILE); //CANNOT BE RESIZABLE  glfwWindowHint(GLFW_RESIZABLE, GL_FALSE);  GLFWwindow* window = glfwCreateWindow(800, 600, "LearnOpenGL", nullptr,  nullptr);          if (window = nullptr)                     {                         std::cout &lt;&lt; "Failed to creat GLFW window" &lt;&lt;  std::endl;                         glfwTerminate();                         return -1;                       }                     glfwMakeContextCurrent(window);    } </code></pre>  <p>Album of Images of Properties and the Problems <a href="http://imgur.com/a/4zHea" rel="nofollow">http://imgur.com/a/4zHea</a></p>  <p>Album of the folders where I put the Libs and headers <a href="http://imgur.com/a/wCnff" rel="nofollow">http://imgur.com/a/wCnff</a></p>  <p>How do I solve this?</p>
