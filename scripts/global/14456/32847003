<p>I am trying to build a calculator that will give me the calculation for width <em>length and Area and perimeter. Now where I'm stuck, once I label the text box ( txtWidth) and then I click on it to bring up the code editor what do I put in under the handler. Second question how do I enter the math for them. Like I know that to get the area I just do width</em>length and for perimeter it's 2*width + 2*length. And I also need to add fractional decimal entries like 10.5 and 20.65. I hope this gives more insight to what I'm trying to do.</p>
