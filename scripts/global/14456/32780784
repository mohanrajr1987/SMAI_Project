<p>I have some trouble when deploying my web application which is using a Nuget package for Gdal.</p>  <p>When installing the Gdal 4 DLL gets included and then a lot of COM(?) objects get but in a folder. These are being loaded through PInvoke. This all works fine on my dev machine.</p>  <p>Then I use web deploy to my server. To begin with i got errors that a ogr_wrap.dll could not be found and i added a _bin_deployableAssemblies folder with all the content from the Nuget package. And when I do a web deploy it all get nicely copied to the Bin folder on the server. Yet when I call a method I receive an error </p>  <pre><code>Unable to find an entry point named 'CSharp_Geometry_ExportToGML__SWIG_0' in DLL 'ogr_wrap'. at OSGeo.OGR.OgrPINVOKE.Geometry_ExportToGML__SWIG_0(HandleRef jarg1)  at OSGeo.OGR.Geometry.ExportToGML() </code></pre>  <p>Im using Visual Studio 2010. The server is a 32 bit machine</p>
