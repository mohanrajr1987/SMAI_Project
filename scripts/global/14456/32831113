<p>I'm new to SourceTree and I'm working on a solution in Visual Studio that I checked out of Git. After check-out, naturally, the first thing I did was build the solution. This kicked in the Nuget Restore mechanism which started doing things to some files in the solution. Everything compiled without errors, but when I look in SourceTree I see that a bunch of files were added to the Unstaged Files list. Most of them were <code>.dll</code> files, some were <code>.xml</code> files, some where even executables like WebGrease (<code>WG.exe</code>). </p>  <p>Do I put them all in the ignore list? And if yes, do I commit this <code>.gitignore</code> file that also gets added to the Unstaged Files list?</p>
