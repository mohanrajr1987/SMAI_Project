<p>I have developed a office application using interop assemblies for Office 2010 in Visual studio 2010.The PIA referred in this is 14.All works fine here. Now I have changed the office 2010 to 2013,so referred PIA 15 in VS 2010.The project builds successfully.When I run the application,the word document launches but Ms office configuration setup also start and after completing the setup it prompt to close the launched office component.It start happening after changing office 2010 to 2013. I have tried removing old references from project and adding again for Office 15 library.But still the same. After a lot search,i found something in my .vbproj file</p>  <pre><code>&lt;Reference Include="Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word, Version=14.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=71e9bce111e9429c, processorArchitecture=MSIL"&gt;   &lt;SpecificVersion&gt;False&lt;/SpecificVersion&gt;   &lt;EmbedInteropTypes&gt;True&lt;/EmbedInteropTypes&gt;   &lt;HintPath&gt;C:\Windows\assembly\GAC_MSIL\Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word\15.0.0.0__71e9bce111e9429c\Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word.dll&lt;/HintPath&gt; &lt;/Reference&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Is anything need to change here ?
