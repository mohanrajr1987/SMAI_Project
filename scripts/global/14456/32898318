<p>Our company is planning to start a large new WinForm project, it will be written in c#-4.0 using Visual Studio 2010.</p>  <p>This project will have many modules (Production, Accounting, Service and etc...) and each module with have lots of possible forms. So we are testing the idea of create multiple projects inside a single solution and have each module be it's own project rather then having a single very large project.</p>  <p>I created a test solution with two projects <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong>, next I added each project as a reference to the other project, when adding one project as a reference to the other, I right clicked on <em>Reference</em>><em>Add Reference</em>>Browsed to the other projects <em>bin/Debug</em> folder and added the other project's <em>.exe</em> as the reference. Next, using the other project as a namespace I was able to do things like form inheritance and opening forms or calling methods between my two test projects.</p>  <p>But I accidently clicked <em>Clean Solution</em> which cleaned the bin/Debug folder for my two projects, and all of my references between the two projects were broken.</p>  <p>What is a proper and reliable way to add permanently references between projects inside a single solution? I was thinking I could physically copy each project's .exe into the other projects bin, then add it as a reference. But that means I'll have to manually re-copy it every time the other project get's updated.</p>
