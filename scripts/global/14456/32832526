<p>In my company, we are using Team Server Foundation 2010. </p>  <p>Last week when I was checking out some ssrs (sql server reporting services 2010) files, I obtained the correct files from TFS. I could see that the files were still connected to TFS.</p>  <p>However, I think there was a time last week where there was a message saying that I was working offline.</p>  <p>Now when I obtained the most current code from TFS, I do get the correct code. However I do not see that the code is connected to TFS any longer. Basically when using Source Control Explorer, I do not see that this code is linked to TFS</p>  <p>Thus I would like to know how to get my code back to accessed in TFS 2010?</p>
