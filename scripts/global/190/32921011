<p>First of all, this is not a duplicate.  When I display the basic MessageBox, it uses Windows XP/2000 style for buttons and icons. The solution is to add custom manifest with this section:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;dependency&gt;     &lt;dependentAssembly&gt;       &lt;assemblyIdentity type="win32" name="Microsoft.Windows.Common-Controls" version="6.0.0.0" processorArchitecture="*" publicKeyToken="6595b64144ccf1df" language="*" /&gt;     &lt;/dependentAssembly&gt;   &lt;/dependency&gt; </code></pre>  <p>The problem is that the project won't build. More precisely, if I disable ClickOnce security it will, but it makes it obviously useless, because I can't use ClickOnce deployment. Is there some kind of workaround? Of course it is not really important, but the legacy MessageBox is just ugly. The build error with enabled security is</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Error 1   Could not find file 'Microsoft.Windows.Common-Controls,   Version=6.0.0.0, Culture=<em>, PublicKeyToken=6595b64144ccf1df,   ProcessorArchitecture=</em>, Type=win32'</p> </blockquote>  <p>I am using Windows 10 pro. Please don't suggest changing deployment method.</p>
