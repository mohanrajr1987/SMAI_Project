<p>currently I am writing a deployscript for our build system. I have an ec2 machine that i want to push my installer to, install the program and then run the program (exe). The program is in fact a server that should run forever. I already tried doing this with Powershell Remoting, this is not satisfying because a permanent connection is needed (if the powershell remote session disconnects, the process terminates).</p>  <p>Now I am looking into Invoke-WMIObject, is this really the best way to go, or am I missing something obvious?  Requirement is that the whole build process can be run from a powershell script (which is executed by our build server). </p>  <p>The server is running windows 2008 Server R2</p>  <p>kind regards</p>
