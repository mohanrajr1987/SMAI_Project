<p>In developing a network application for Windows, I need to consider how the software will operate if the application is installed and run in a Domain environment, as compared to a Workgroup or non-domain environment.  I have limited experience with software in such installations, and although we will test our product thoroughly, I need to be aware of differences that may exist as early as possible.</p>  <p>The application is currently targeted at <code>.NET4.5</code> and consists of two modules:</p>  <ol> <li>A Windows service, run as <code>LocalSystem</code>, which starts Automatically.</li> <li>A WinForms application, run on the system at login, which lives in the task tray for 99% of its life.</li> </ol>  <p>The Windows Service</p>  <ol> <li>Uses two specific <code>UDP</code> and <code>TCP</code> ports to communicate over the local network.</li> <li>Communicates with the WinForms application via <code>TCP</code> at <code>localhost</code>.</li> <li>Communicates with a server on the internet, outbound only, via a RESTful API.</li> <li>Automatically attempts to create exceptions for itself in the Windows Firewall. Customers will be expected to create any other required exceptions for other firewall or AV products manually.</li> <li>During a live-test installation (in the wild) would ideally have attached <code>cdb.exe</code> or similar for the purpose of automatically building a crash dump should the service throw an unhandled exception and terminate.</li> </ol>  <p>The WinForms Application</p>  <ol> <li>Does not have User-Specific configurations.  Application-level configurations only.</li> <li>Communicates with the Windows Service via <code>TCP</code> at <code>localhost</code>.</li> <li>Following installation should run at login for all users.</li> </ol>  <p>Given this arrangement and description, what are some potential pitfalls that I should be aware of, if the operating environment is domain-based?</p>  <p>For example, how can a Group Policy affect the desired operation per above?  It's not a problem for us to require that such a Group Policy must be changed</p>
