<p>I need to check the deployment status of my application which is deployed by Wildfly 8.2.1 programmatically (preferably java). As far I am concerned, there can be multiple ways to achieve this:</p>  <ol> <li>monitoring the semaphore files in the deployment folder (like if deployed there are .deployed files created for the war files). </li> <li>check by calling a rest service which is supposed to be available when the war file is successfully deployed</li> <li>using JMX mbeans</li> </ol>  <p>There might be other ways too, which I am not yet aware of. But I am more interested in learning the ways of using <strong>JMX mbeans</strong>. But unfortunately my online search is not giving me any good direction. If anyone can shed some light to this that would be really helpful.    </p>
