<p>I have spent some time recently learning the basic Capistrano deploy method and I managed to deploy code from SVN to our internal server. As we know, Capistrano deploys the code to the "releases" folder.</p>  <p>I am stuck on the last piece. I am trying to deploy a Magento extension and in SVN, we just have the extension but not the whole Magento application code.</p>  <p>Ideally, I want my extension to get deployed at the right place. Instead of </p>  <blockquote>   <p>/releases/xxxxxxx/app/code/community/MyModuleName/MyExtensionName</p> </blockquote>  <p>I want it to be at</p>  <blockquote>   <p>/magento/app/code/community/MyModuleName/MyExtensionName</p> </blockquote>  <p>The case is same with the deploy of <em>design</em> as well as <em>etc</em> folder. I thought of writing a script to move from the releases folder to the folders I have specified above but that looked ugly. I am also not sure if I am on the right track.</p>  <p>Excuse me for my ignorance and please help!</p>
