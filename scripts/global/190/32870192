<p>I have successfully built my artifacts and uploaded the artifacts with the help of code deploy plugin in jenkins</p>  <p>Now I have a scenario where I'll deploy my revision but will not trigger the codedeploy automatically. I'll login to amazon console and select uploaded revision and trigger deployment.</p>  <p>Is there a plugin to upload only the artifact and not trigger deployment?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
