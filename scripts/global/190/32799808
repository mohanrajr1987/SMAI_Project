<h1>Description</h1>  <p>For instance, I have a following flask project structure:</p>  <pre><code>├ project_root/ ├── .gitignore ├── README.md ├── docs ├── requirements.txt ├── yourapp │   ├── templates/ │   ├── static/ │   ├── migrations/ │   ├── config.py │   ├── app1/ │   │   ├── __init__.py │   │   ├── controllers.py │   │   ├── forms.py │   │   └── models.py │   ├── app2/ │   │   └── ... │   └── app.py └── tests/ </code></pre>  <p>And I have following requirements:</p>  <ol> <li>I would like to deploy it with gunicorn behind nginx, with a rabbitmq and celery and postgresql as database. Nginx serves static files from <code>yourapp/static</code></li> <li>I would like to have all configuration be the part of my codebase, for instance all nginx, gunicorn and other configs should be placed somewhere in the same git repository.</li> <li>I would like to use a docker and have following docker images: web-app, postgresql, nginx, rabbitmq and celery-worker. </li> <li>I would like to be able to build all docker images from this git repository </li> <li>I would like to use Dockerfiles</li> </ol>  <h1>Question</h1>  <p><strong>Where should I put configuration files and Dockerfiles if I want to meet all these requirements?</strong></p>  <h1>Additional information</h1>  <p>I have some thoughts, but it's not clear. For instance I know, that I actually don't need a Dockerfile for postgresql image, I can use volume-only container and postgres image from Docker hub.</p>  <p>The main problem, that I can't solve is a interference of the nginx and application scopes: static files should be visible for nginx's Dockerfile and whole flask application also should be visible for gunicorn's Dockerfile, but I can't put 2 Dockerfiles in the same folder.</p>  <p>The other problem, that I would like to have folder with flask code(yourapp) be separated from the configurations folder, and all configuration files(nginx, gunicorn, celery) should be stored in the same folder.</p>
