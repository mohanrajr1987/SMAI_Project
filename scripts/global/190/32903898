<p>I have server with <strong>Nginx</strong>, <strong>PHP5-FPM</strong>.</p>  <p>I'm running 1 process in fpm pool with this configuration:</p>  <pre><code>user = php-site group = www-site  listen = /var/run/php5-fpm_web.sock  listen.owner = php-site listen.group = www-site listen.mode = 0666 </code></pre>  <p>I have these users: - www-site (groups: www-site) - php-site (groups: www-site) - deploy   (groups: deploy, www-site)</p>  <p>This <strong>deploy</strong> user has only SSH access to do some stuff (composer, git deploy, etc..). </p>  <p>Problem is here, my application creates cache files in cache folder. Cache folder has <strong>0775</strong> (deploy:www-site), but <em>cache/template/file.cache</em> has <strong>0644</strong> (php-site:www-site). When I want to purge this cache folder, over <code>rm -rf cache/*</code>, I'm receiving <code>Permission denied</code>.</p>  <hr>  <p>How could I solve it? If php5-fpm would create files with mask <strong>0666</strong> everything gonna be alright. </p>
