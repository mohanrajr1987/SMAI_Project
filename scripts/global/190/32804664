<p>In deploying my OSX application, the .app file was having trouble finding the custom dylib that I coded. Here's the strange thing about that, though:</p>  <ul> <li>It worked in Qt Creator just fine.</li> <li>If I went to command line, cd'd into the directory where my executable app (LibraryTester) and dylib file were located, and did ./LibraryTester, it worked just fine.</li> <li>If I doubleclicked the executable or the .app file icon, the program would crash because it couldn't find the custom dylib that I created.</li> </ul>  <p>Now, I can fix this easily by using install_name_tool like so:</p>  <pre><code>install_name_tool LibraryTester -change mycustom.1.dylib @loader_path/mycustom.1.dylib </code></pre>  <p>(the key thing being the @loader_path variable)</p>  <p>...however, is there a setting in the .pro file of my Qt 5.5 project so that I don't have to keep doing that all the time on deployment?</p>
