<p>Receive ClassNotFoundException when using JRE Deployment Rule Set Platform: Windows 7 x64 Browser: IE 11 32-bit and 64-bit Installed JRE versions: 1.8.0_60 32-bit &amp; 64-bit 1.7.0_79 32-bit &amp; 64-bit</p>  <p>JRE Deployment Rule Set (DRS) is signed and is valid. I added force and changed the DRS version from 1.0 to 1.1, it didn’t change anything.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;ruleset version="1.1+"&gt;   &lt;rule&gt;     &lt;id location="http://%Site%:%Port%/%blahblahblah%/" /&gt;     &lt;action permission="run" version="1.7.0_79" force="true" /&gt;    &lt;/rule&gt; &lt;/ruleset&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I have a site with two different Java applets that are available through different links. The applets are from an external vendor and have not been updated, thus the need for this function in the DRS. Both the applets launch Java and then switch to JRE 1.7.0_79, as directed. One loads fine, the other errors with ClassNotFoundException – com/%AppName%/wcm/api/User. The details in the Java Console lead with, "log4j:WARN No appenders could be found for logger (%AppName%.vw.base). log4j:WARN Please initialize the log4j system properly." </p>  <p>The kicker is that when only JRE 1.7.0_79 is installed both applets load without issue. </p>  <p>My best guess is that the DRS can’t handle spaces in some of the paths. I’ve seen this line “com/%AppName%/wcm/api/User“ as the trailing part of a longer path in the logs. Ultimately I’d love to go to the vendor and tell them to fix their code, but I’m doing this because that hasn’t happened yet. :P</p>  <p>Has anyone seen this before or does anyone have any idea what the resolution to the issue might be?</p>
