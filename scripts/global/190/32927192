<p>We are trying to deploy a Google Web Application.   The applications runs fine on local machine but ran into an issue when deploying as Google App Engine.</p>  <pre><code>-- Our Index File has this line    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="validation_form"&gt;Data Validation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  -- Where validation_form is another HTML file in the same folder (WEB_iNF)       Insert Data in the box below     &lt;form action="results/validation" method="post"&gt;           &lt;textarea rows="50" cols="50" name = "inputJson" &gt;         &lt;/textarea&gt;          &lt;input type="submit" value="submit"/&gt;       &lt;/form&gt;    </code></pre>  <p>on localhost when the link is clicked on the index page, the validation_form opens at localhost:8888/validation_form.</p>  <p>On Google App Engine, when I click the link, it downloads the validation_form to the local drive.  </p>  <p>I was expecting this to show up at "myapp.appspot.com/validation_form".</p>  <p>Appreciate any suggestions.  Thanks.</p>
