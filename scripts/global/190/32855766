<p>i actually have a rest api written in python with flask and flaskrestful extension. I use gevent WSGI</p>  <pre><code>def runserver(): api.debug = True http_server = WSGIServer(('', 5000), api) http_server.start() </code></pre>  <p>All works like a charm on my machine. I want go in production on a linux vm,on the internet i searched for hours,i don't choosed mod_wsgi because gevent doesn't work properly with it,so i prefer use nginx.</p>  <p>On the internet i saw flask apps hosted with uWSGI,my answer is i need to use uWSGI? Even i use geventWSGI in my flask application? How to work with this? In case i don't need uWSGI,i only need to config nginx sites to pass the request properly to my flask app? I'm newbie to all this so i'm a little confused.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
