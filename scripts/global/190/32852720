<p>I know this question has been asked many, many times before, but the answers don't seem to help me. Here is  my specific issue:</p>  <p>I have a class "TaQL" that accesses two text files from within its void main(String args[]) method. The two text files are in the same package as this class: package "taql". The following code runs fine within Eclipse (Mars) IDE:</p>  <pre><code>    String stoplist = TaQL.class.getResource(stoplist).toURI().getPath();     String input = TaQL.class.getResource(input).toURI().getPath(); </code></pre>  <p>When I output these two strings I get the correct path to the resource and the code hums along.</p>  <p>However, when I use this method after packaging everything up in a JAR, both strings return "null".</p>  <p>Here is what my code does with each of these text files in the non-JAR version</p>  <ol> <li>Get filename string for each text file.</li> <li>create a new File object from one string and a new FileReader object from the other.</li> <li>These are fed into a stoplist function and a data input iterator, respectively.</li> </ol>  <p>What I really need to be able to do is to seamlessly access these two text files once they are all in a JAR and then use some reference to these to create a File and FileReader object.</p>  <p>Here is some diagnostic code I put in my main method. It will show what the JAR file is seeing as far as files (note that both input and stoplist are filename strings):</p>  <pre><code>    System.out.println("intput argument" + input);      System.out.println("Resource path"+TaQL.class.getResource(stoplist));      stoplist = TaQL.class.getResource(stoplist).toURI().getPath();     input = TaQL.class.getResource(input).toURI().getPath();      System.out.println("Path"+stoplist);     System.out.println("Input path" + input); </code></pre>  <p>command line output from running the JAR version of my program (note that this code works perfectly fine when I run from Eclipse)</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/dr2JL.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/dr2JL.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
