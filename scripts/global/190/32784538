<p>I'm using Spacewalk to deploy simple bash scripts (as root) and, as expected for a <strong>not interactive, not login shell session</strong>, <code>/root/.bashrc</code> or <code>/root/.bash_profile</code> does not get sourced on the targeted machines when executing the deployed script. But this is kind of annoying as many commands are failing due to missing env variables.</p>  <p>Deploying this script via Spacewalk :</p>  <pre><code>#!/bin/bash env [[ $- == *i* ]] &amp;&amp; echo 'Interactive' || echo 'Not interactive' shopt -q login_shell &amp;&amp; echo 'Login shell' || echo 'Not login shell' whoami </code></pre>  <p>output :</p>  <pre><code>TERM=linux PATH=/sbin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin _=/bin/env RUNLEVEL=5 runlevel=5 PWD=/ LANGSH_SOURCED=1 LANG=en_US.UTF-8 PREVLEVEL=N previous=N CONSOLETYPE=vt SHLVL=4 UPSTART_INSTANCE= UPSTART_EVENTS=runlevel UPSTART_JOB=rc Not interactive Not login shell root </code></pre>  <p>Many Env Variables declared in /etc/profile.d/ are missing.</p>  <p>Starting "every" scripts deployed via Spacewalk with <code>. /root/.bashrc</code> will obviously get all needed variables updated, but I'm trying to understand why I would need to do that in the first place ? Isn't a login session (sourcing /root/.bash_profile) initiated first when the script is launched via Spacewalk ?</p>
