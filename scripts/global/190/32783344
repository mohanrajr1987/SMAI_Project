<p>I'm new in Android development, and I couldn't find much information on how to deploy and publish an android app made with React Native to the google-play. </p>  <p>Does anyone know were I can find more information about it (like a tutorial or something...)? I didn't find anything on the documentation. </p>  <p>Thanks...</p>
