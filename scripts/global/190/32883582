<p>I'm wondering which options are there for docker container deployment in production. Given I have separate APP and DB server containers and data-only containers holding deployables and other holding database files.</p>  <p>I just have one server for now, which I would like to "docker enable", but what is the best way to deploy there(remotely will be the best option)</p>  <p>I just want to hit a button and some tool will take care of stopping, starting, exchanging all needed docker containers. </p>  <p>There is myriad of tools(Fleet, Flocker, Docker Compose etc.), I'm overwhelmed by the choices. </p>  <p>Only thing I'm clear is, I don't want to build images with codes from git repo. I would like to have docker images as wrappers for my releases. Have I grasped the docker ideas from wrong end?</p>
