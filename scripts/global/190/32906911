<p>I know we should do TDD to prevent this and I know release manager is the key responsible for something like this. But we are a small company at this moment and I have to do something urgently.</p>  <p>I need to create a deployment strategy for my company, shortly I must force the developers making a code review for the latest pushed commit before they send their codes. My aim is to create a self-driven structure during deployment. Is it possible? </p>
