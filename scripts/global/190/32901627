<p>I've developed an application with the MEAN stack on WebStorm and now I want to put it online on Heroku. I have faced many many problems and already (partially solved) some of them, but, the app still encounters an error when its deployed.</p>  <p>I will list all the steps I've taken and things I need (or I think I need) to do, to put it online.</p>  <p>The app uses: RaphaelJS, Bootstrap+CSS, AngularJS, a MongoDB database already hosted on MongoLabs and nodeJS for the server-side code.</p>  <p>The first steps are to create a package.json and a Procfile.</p>  <p>In the folder of the repo I used the command npm init to automatically create the following package.json:</p>  <pre><code>{   "name": "herokuFinalApp",   "version": "0.0.0",   "description": "deployment attempt with heroku",   "main": "app.js",   "dependencies": {     "body-parser": "^1.14.0",     "mongoose": "^4.1.7",     "nodemailer": "^0.7.1",     "express": "^4.13.3",     "cors": "^2.7.1"   },   "devDependencies": {},   "scripts": {     "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" &amp;&amp; exit 1",     "start": "node server.js"   },   "repository": {     "type": "git",     "url": "https://github.com/bruno-oliveira/herokuFinalApp.git"   },   "author": "bruno",   "license": "ISC",   "bugs": {     "url": "https://github.com/bruno-oliveira/herokuFinalApp/issues"   } } </code></pre>  <p>The dependencies listed there dont include in any way nothing related to RaphaelJS and/or the more "graphical" part, so, the way I see it myself, I am not referencing in any way the CSS/RaphaelJS files as a dependency...and I think I should...It doesnt refer AngularJS, that is inside a bower_components folder (see below)</p>  <p>The procfile follows the "standard" definition, i.e. :</p>  <pre><code>web: node server.js </code></pre>  <p>where server.js is where I start the server. I've ran into some doubts here too, because in WebStorm, I usually start the  database models first, i.e. I establish the connection to the remote database in a file called database_1.js and after running that, I run another one called database_2.js to add some data models to my DB and only afterwards I do server.js</p>  <p>I dont see that listed on the above Procfile, but adding those other files fixed nothing.</p>  <p>Then, the last question I have is: can a github repository being used for deployment have the following folder structure:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/mBMKG.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/mBMKG.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>or do I need to put everything in the same place (without any folders).</p>  <p>Any pointers will be great.</p>
