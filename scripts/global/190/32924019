<p>So I am fairly new to laravel and especial to its deploying. I set up a fortrabbit application and got my website running so that's all good. The thing is though, the app url is not the one I wanted. I have an older website running without Laravel, and that is the url I want it to be hosted on. I have the ftp credentials for the old site but I have no clue how I can sort of clone the new Laravel site to the old one.</p>  <p>Briefly, I have a Laravel app running on insertname.eu1.frbit.net but I want it to be hosted on www.insertname.com which an older site is being hosted on for the time being.</p>  <p>Can anyone help me out? There must be a way to do this. Thanks alot!</p>
