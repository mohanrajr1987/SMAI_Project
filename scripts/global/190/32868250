<p>I'm trying to understand what is the best way to deploy custom modules from a development environment to staging or production. Reading from SugarCRM support pages (<a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/04_Knowledge_Base/02Administration/100Studio_and_Module_Builder/01_Best_Practices_When_Building_Custom_Modules/" rel="nofollow">http://support.sugarcrm.com/04_Knowledge_Base/02Administration/100Studio_and_Module_Builder/01_Best_Practices_When_Building_Custom_Modules/</a>), all new modules should be built with Module Builder. The output of this is a <code>.zip</code> file which is a deployable unit. Then the support page says never to redeploy a package and all further modifications should be done with Studio.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Once the module is deployed, you should use Studio to perform any additional configurations to your module ...</p> </blockquote>  <p>As I understand, Studio modifies files in the <code>custom/</code> directory and there's no deployable package with the changes (e.g. a <code>.zip</code> file). How can I deploy changes made with Studio to staging or production environments? I was thinking of using Git and have the modifications in <code>custom/</code> directory tracked. Then I could pull the changes to the desired environment. Is this a viable solution? Or has anyone come up with something else?</p>
