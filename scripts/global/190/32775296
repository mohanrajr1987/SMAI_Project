<p>I'm trying to make git auto deploy to different directories depending on a branch that was pushed. I have a remote bare repository, local repository and two directories where I whant the data to be deployed and updated with each push from local to remote repository. I've added post-update hook:</p>  <pre><code>#!/bin/sh   echo $1 echo "*UPDATE*"   case " $1 " in *'refs/heads/develop'*)         GIT_WORK_TREE=/home/git/public_html/example_deploy_dev git checkout develop webroot         echo         echo "Dev was pulled"         echo         ;; esac  case " $1 " in *'refs/heads/master'*)         GIT_WORK_TREE=/home/git/public_html/example_deploy git checkout master webroot         echo         echo "Master was pulled"         echo         ;; esac </code></pre>  <p>It deploys just fine on first file creation, but doesn't update it when it's changed in directories which shold be deployed. Where do I miss smth? Thanks!</p>
