<p>Excuse my dev ops naivet√© but I assume all you need to deploy to a machine is a proper SSH key, a port to expose, the machine's IP address a login and the code to deploy.  </p>  <p>So are there any simple solutions that deploy code to a remote server with the only input being an SSH key, a Dockerfile and the code itself?  I'm thinking it could be set up in a deterministic (almost functional) manner where the input is server IP address, login, and the output is a running server.</p>  <p>I've tried setting up Dokku on digital ocean (<a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-the-digitalocean-dokku-application">https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-the-digitalocean-dokku-application</a>) and that requires a DNS record, and git.  I don't need those as dependencies.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
