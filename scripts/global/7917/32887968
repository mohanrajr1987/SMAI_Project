<p>I don't want to have radio buttons in my app as they don't suit for selecting images. So, I want something similar to this slider <a href="http://visiontime.in/#services" rel="nofollow">http://visiontime.in/#services</a> to select an image among a list of images in Android. </p>  <p>(Most contemporary TVs esp. Sony Bravia, use this kind of UI for selecting options)</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/uPCGV.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/uPCGV.jpg" alt="TV UI"></a></p>  <p>Is there a layout predefined for something like that? If not, how do I implement it the right way? </p>  <p>Will this help (I just thought of this solution)?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/H9Vte.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/H9Vte.png" alt="My solution"></a></p>
