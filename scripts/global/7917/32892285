<p>I have a question related to implementation of iDangero.us Swiper with React. I have been playing with it for a while and my problem is that the actual sliding doesn't work in situation when I work with dynamic data. Let me illustrate this on example.</p>  <p>My code is composed in following way:</p>  <p>1) I have a component called SwiperComponent. There are two parts - method componentDidMount() where I put the initialisation of the Swiper component and render() one where I generate the structure defined by iDangero.us Swiper.</p>  <pre><code>var SwiperComponent = React.createClass({   componentDidMount() {     this.swipe = new Swiper(React.findDOMNode(this), {       slidesPerView: 3,       centeredSlides: true,       spaceBetween: 10     });   },    render() {     return React.createElement('div', React.__spread({}, this.props, {className: 'swiper-container'}),       React.createElement('div', {className: 'swiper-wrapper'},         React.Children.map(this.props.children, function (child, index) {           return React.createElement('div', {className: 'swiper-slide'}, React.cloneElement(child));        })       )     );   } }); </code></pre>  <p>2) I have a simple Index.jsx file where I prepare a 'dynamic content' in a way that I simply create an array which I populate with some images.</p>  <pre><code>var Index = React.createClass({    getInitialState: function() {     return {       movies: []     };   },    componentDidMount() {     this.setState({       movies: ["http://www.themusehotel.com/design/images/930-481/nyc-skyline.jpg", "https://ephemeralnewyork.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/broadway47thstreet2010.jpg", "http://41.media.tumblr.com/27d14da3be1e02eb7b6ead5bda0ac1b2/tumblr_n5dqi4XDz61qdeuyro1_1280.jpg", "http://photos.cntraveler.com/2014/09/29/5429c32b425f183f61bf7316_new-york-city-skyline.jpg"],     });   },     render: function() {     var items = this.state.movies;      return (       &lt;SwiperComponent&gt;       {         items.map((item) =&gt; {           return (            &lt;img src={item} width="100%" height="200"/&gt;           )         })       }       &lt;/SwiperComponent&gt;     )   } }); </code></pre>  <p>As I mentioned, the problem is that the sliding part doesn't work. Quite interesting thing is that it starts working once I open the developer console in Chrome or swipe out the array and place some static tags instead of.</p>  <p>I prepare a JSfiddle where you can see this problem in action - <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/4z3zyk07/4/" rel="nofollow">https://jsfiddle.net/4z3zyk07/4/</a></p>  <p>Does anybody know what I have been missing and doing wrong? I will appreciate your help a lot. Thank you very much!</p>  <p>Radek</p>
