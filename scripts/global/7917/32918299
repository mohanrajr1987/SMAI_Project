<p>I'm using <a href="http://supersimpleslider.com/" rel="nofollow">SSS</a> to display a slider of images, but can't access its next_slide() and prev_slide() functions. I think it should be because of the way the object is defined, would you be able to help getting access the navigation triggers?</p>  <p>Source: <a href="https://github.com/intllgnt/SSS/blob/master/sss/sss.js" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/intllgnt/SSS/blob/master/sss/sss.js</a></p>
