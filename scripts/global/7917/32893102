<p>I have a template with embedded Slider Revolution along with a lot of libraries. Due to a conflict or maybe something else I have the following problem. If I resize browser window, the slide elements can overlap each other. But if I press F5, everything is good again for that particular size.</p>  <p>So, the question is what Slider Revolution API function should I call to recalculate all slides and their elements, as if the page has been reloaded, without actual reloading the page on every resize?</p>  <p>Regards,</p>
