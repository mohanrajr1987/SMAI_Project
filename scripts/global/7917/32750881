<p>I am new to jQuery, and messing around with an image slider. Although I know there's lots out there. I'd rather understand it myself. </p>  <p>Here's what I have, and pardon the newbie stuff. </p>  <pre><code>$( document ).ready(function() {       // image timer         setInterval("slideImages()", 2000);     });      function slideImages(){         //sets current position or slider         var currentPosition = 0;         $(".main-img").animate({'marginLeft': '-=960px'});          currentPosition++          if(currentPosition &gt; 3){             alert("done");         }     }      slideImages(); </code></pre>  <p>Easy to make work, but I can't seem to sort out the logic to have it come back to it's start point. </p>  <p>Can I increment a counter for its position every time it animates? </p>
