<p>I am using a jquery layer slider on my html. Below is the url. <a href="http://subhasreemazumdar.com/subhasree_hmc/" rel="nofollow">http://subhasreemazumdar.com/subhasree_hmc/</a></p>  <p>I am not able to centre align the layer in the layer slider. When i inspect code with firebug, the ls-l element has an "element.style{margin-left:0;}". How to override the element.style css. I have added a rule in the layerslider.css as below but it is not working.     .ls-l     {         margin-left:auto;         margin-right: auto;         display: block;     }</p>  <p>How can i make the div layer in layer slider aligned to center of the screen.</p>
