<p>I have implemented a slider using Daimaja android slider library. i have included that library as a module in my project. I want to have a left and right arrow in my slider as well as indicator at the bottom. The slider with the indicator is working fine. But just to give the user same look and feel in app as that in the webpage, i need to add these left and right arrow at sides, so that when user click on arrow , the slider moves in the respective direction. But all the touch events are being intercepted by slider image itself and i am not able to pass the touch events to the arrow to move the slider. Please help me. </p>
