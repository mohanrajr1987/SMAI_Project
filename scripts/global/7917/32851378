<p>I've tried Swiper for web and all went really good. Now i have to realize an iOS app that include Swiper in some slides. I'm having some problems to activate my slide. I initialize my object Swiper within my controller:</p>  <pre><code>app.controller('composeCtrl', function($scope){      // sliders     var swiperMontatura = new Swiper('.swiper-container-montatura', {         initialSlide: 2,         slidesPerView: 5,         observer: true,         observeParents: true,         centeredSlides: true,         paginationClickable: true,         spaceBetween: 10,         width: 1400     });  }); </code></pre>  <p>If i launch <code>ionic serve</code> in the terminal to see the result in my browser, everything goes normally, after my build i don't see the same in my app, the slider doesn't work.</p>  <p>Any suggestions?</p>
