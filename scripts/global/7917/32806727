<p>I have a html code which is composed of a carousel made by Menucool Plugin and Amazing slider. The code works in desktop, but when I tried to use the Smart TV to display the page, both web pages have problems in playing the video. The page that uses the Menu cool Plugin doesn't auto-play the video. On the other hand, the page that is created by Amazing Slider auto-plays the video but stays on 0:00 (in other words, you can only see a black screen). What puzzling me is that this two codes mentioned works before. Can anyone help me?</p>
