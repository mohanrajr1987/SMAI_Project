<p>I am trying to add new slides to Nivo slider which is on a Wordpress install. The slider is not installed as a plugin and it's custom post types which let it know which images to use. I have uploaded all images (they are client logos) to the relevant custom post types but Nivo slider wont append the images to the existing slides.</p>  <p>Where do I find the settings for Nivo slider to change the number of slides it displays?</p>  <p>Many thanks</p>  <p>Billy</p>
