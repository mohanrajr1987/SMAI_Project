<p>I have tried couple of regular expressions but have not been able to come up with one that works correctly. I have string with lines and I want to keep the lines which contains numbers.</p>  <pre><code>Current String -----------------  Dog  Cat  Cat 1  Dog 22 </code></pre>  <p>Once processed the expected result is:</p>  <pre><code>Filtered String ----------------- Cat 1  Dog 22 </code></pre>
