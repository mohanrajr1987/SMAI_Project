<p>How can I create, in HTML, a textbox which I can customize with CSS and has a character limit, and the string that the user passes gets stored in a js var? I want the data to be submitted when, let's say, the function <code>submit()</code> gets executed. </p>  <p>I've try researching but I don't see any tutorial with what I want. I've seen tutorials of how to make forms but I want just the one textbox. </p>  <p>I'm sorry I don't include any code, but I still don't have nothing regarding this part of my project.</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>  <p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Also, is there a way to know, as the user types, how many character he or she has left?</p>
