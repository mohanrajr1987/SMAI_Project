<p>This is the code I am having trouble with:</p>  <pre><code>Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click     Dim THR As Double     Dim a As Double     Dim r As Double     THR = CDbl(0.7 * (220 - a) + 0.3 * r)     textBox.Text = "Your THR is" &amp; THR &amp; " beats a minute"  End Sub </code></pre>  <p>I want to get the information from <code>TextBox1</code> and <code>TextBox2</code> and then print it out to <code>TextBox</code>, but I am having a hard time understanding where to begin. </p>
