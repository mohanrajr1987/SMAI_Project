<p>I want to create a multiline textbox control that will be used for an application as "Snap to grid" when all of the characters are Monospaced, and the fitting font size was found (for example - for a textbox with 6 columns, exactly 6 characters should be entered). - Of course with Word Wrap!</p>  <p>As for the above - it's OK. The correct way to calculate the font size was found.</p>  <p>The only issue is that I need to create an "Alt+Enter" option to represent "Enter". </p>  <p>For some reasons, I can't use \r\n and need that all of the remaining line space will be full of whitespaces. The thing is that wrap doesn't accept spaces in an amount which is larger than the textbox's width. For example:</p>  <p>If I write in a textbox with width=8cells, the following (or paste that string etc..):</p>  <p>"Hello      World!" ("Hello+6Whitespaces+World!") </p>  <p>I would like to recieve: (_=whitespace)</p>  <p>First Line: Hello___ </p>  <p>Second Line: ___World</p>  <p>Third Line: !</p>  <p>What really happens is:</p>  <p>First Line: Hello___</p>  <p>Second Line: World!</p>  <p>(No spaces at all in the beginning of the second line)</p>  <p>PS - On debug I can see that the spaces (all of them) are considered as a part of the string.</p>
