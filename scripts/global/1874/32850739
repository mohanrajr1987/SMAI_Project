<p>I would like to create a dialogue box that is embedded in a window that a user can input values. All of the resources I have found show how to create a dialogue box with a gui, which is not what I'm trying to do. It would be greatly appreciated if someone could show me where I can find some resources to answer this question or give me some functions or modules that might help.</p>
