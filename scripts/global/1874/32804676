<p>I'm using <a href="/questions/tagged/winforms" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;winforms&#39;" rel="tag">winforms</a>. I have 2 forms which contain a <code>TextBox</code> and a <code>Button</code> in each form. My goal is to get the content from the <code>TextBox</code> on <code>form1</code> to the TextBox on <code>form2</code> on a click of a button. I also want to close form1 and only show <code>form2</code> with the content that was typed in the TextBox on <code>form1</code>. </p>  <p>This is what I have so far. The problem with my code is the content doesn't show in <code>form2</code>.</p>  <pre><code>this.Hide();  Form2 f2 = new Form2(); f2.ShowDialog();  f2.textBox1.Text = textBox1.Text;             this.Close(); //close form1 </code></pre>
