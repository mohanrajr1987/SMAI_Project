<p>I have a WPF application that loads XML content from a DB and displays it in the GUI for the user to view &amp; update.</p>  <p>Using a <code>System.Windows.Controls.TextBox</code> works OK, but the user can modify everything. Normally, I would like to have only the content editable and the tags read-only.</p>  <p>Currently I'm using <code>ICSharpCode.AvalonEdit.TextEditor</code> in order to have highlighting and folding. Ideally, all three functionalities (read-only tags, code highlighting and folding) should be included in the solution.</p>
