<p>Is there a way in VBA Excel Userform to automatically create textboxes on the userform based on the number of rows on a particular sheet?</p>  <p>My data is in Sheet 1 starting from A1, being:</p>  <ul> <li>A1: Invoice Date</li> <li>B1: Invoice No.</li> <li>C1: Invoice Amount</li> <li>D1: Payment Received</li> </ul>  <p>Now there are many rows of data (invoices) and there is no way one can know how many rows relate to a particular customer. The Payment received textboxes would be empty when the userform loads while Invoice Date, Invoice No. and Invoice Amount would be taken from Sheet 1.</p>  <p>Then it would be very easy to fill the the payment received textboxes payments can be applied to a particular invoice.</p>
