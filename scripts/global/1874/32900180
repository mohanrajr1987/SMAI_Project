<p>I use standart TextBox  in my windows universal app. When  I enter text to TextBox  appears button delete. </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/n61C6.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/n61C6.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I need a press event to button delete. It should simply be, but I found nothing. Or do I just go to sleep :)</p>  <p>update:</p>  <p>I solved this problem by binding properties of the text.</p>
