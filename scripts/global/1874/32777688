<p>I'm using .NET Framework 4.6 and C# 6.0 and I'm trying to create a control which should look like the one for attached files in an Outlook-Email: A Textbox where filenames are shown which represents a link to the file. With double-clicking into one of the filename, the file will open. With having the cursor inside the textbox and pressing the "delete"-key, the filename will be removed.</p>  <p>At the moment I created a Textbox. To add a filename, a LinkLabel will be created and added to the Controls-Collection of the Textbox (Textbox.Controls.Add(...)).</p>  <p>For one filename, it works fine. But when I add another LinkLabel to the controls, the second one will be shown behind the first one. Why? And how can I handle it? It doesn#t make sense to display them behind each other... I want to have them next to each other..</p>  <p>Also what exactly happens with adding a control to the textbox in the background?</p>
