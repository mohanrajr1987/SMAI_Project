<p>I am developing a chat application on JavaFX and I stuck with a little problem. In short, I want to have a possibility to insert an image(for example smiles) inside TextField which is intended for text input.But as I know, there is no possibility to insert images inside this element. Does JavaFX have some alternatives for that or maybe you know something else, what I can use for this?</p>  <p>Thank you, in advance.</p>
