<p>I am trying to update a bookmark within a Word document realtime from a textbox field within an addin panel I have created. I have created an event handler that fires off background worker thread that updates the bookmark. The issue I am having is that after a single character is entered in the textbox the bookmark updates, but the cursor jumps to the body of the Word document and doesnt remain in the addin panes textbox waiting for more text. Does anyone know how I can keep the cursor within the textbox whilst typing in more text?</p>  <pre><code>public partial class ShipperPane : UserControl {     BackgroundWorker bw = new BackgroundWorker();      public ShipperPane()     {         InitializeComponent();     }      private void textBox1_TextChanged(object sender, EventArgs e)     {         bw.DoWork += bw_DoWork;         bw.RunWorkerAsync();     }      private void bw_DoWork(object sender, DoWorkEventArgs e)     {         Globals.ThisDocument.fooBookmark.Text = textBox1.Text;     } } </code></pre>
