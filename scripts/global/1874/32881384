<p>I am designing a WinForm application , in which I need to show a html content (without any picture), just some content with some formatting(like color, Bold, Italic,Bullet points etc.),</p>  <p>I know there is WebBroswer control, but it can only show the content ,</p>  <pre><code>webBrowser_Description.DocumentText = HttpUtility.HtmlDecode(testDesignStepList[0].Description); </code></pre>  <p>It can't be used as a textbox. where you can change your text,  also I tried something like this over text box :</p>  <pre><code>textBox1.Text = HttpUtility.HtmlEncode(testDesignStepList[0].Description); </code></pre>  <p>also looked to some SO post , which suggest [TextEditor with html output][1],</p>  <p>[1]: <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/15559/A-Windows-Forms-based-text-editor-with-HTML-output" rel="nofollow">http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/15559/A-Windows-Forms-based-text-editor-with-HTML-output</a>, but it says refering to a exe, which sounds little different , to have a separate, for a simple task .</p>  <p>Any easy workaround as per my requirement, would be helpful .   </p>
