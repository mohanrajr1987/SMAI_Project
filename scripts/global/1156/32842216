<p>I have a string in C : "Phone/mis. ie Credit Card pmnt". Its length is 30 chars. I want to append a string in front of this "R*". So that my final output stands as "R* Phone/mis. ie Credit Card p". String truncates over here at the end as its max length is 30 chars. I have tried below code where iov_pPymArr->pymInfoArray[i].type_desc variable contains string "Phone/mis. ie Credit Card pmnt":</p>  <pre><code>sprintf (iov_pPymArr-&gt;pymInfoArray[i].type_desc,"R*%s",iov_pPymArr-&gt;pymInfoArray[i].type_desc);  But it gives me output as : "R*R*e/mis. ie Credit Card pmnt".  </code></pre>  <p>R* is getting appended twice and string is getting truncated from beginning instead of end. Please advice the possible Solution.</p>
