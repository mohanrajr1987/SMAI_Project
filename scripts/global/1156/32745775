<p>So I'm probably being really stupid and missing something super obvious but I'm new to coding so I'm not quite sure howto do this. I would like the user to input a file name and an error message to be displayed if unsuccessful. This is what I have so far:</p>  <pre><code>char filename; //declares variable for input.  printf("Please input the file name.\n"); //asks user to input the name of file.  scanf("%s\n", &amp;filename); //allows user to input file name.  FILE*b= fopen(filename, "r"); //opens the file for reading.  if(!b){      printf("Unable to open the file.\n"); } //if unable to open the file an error message should be displayed. </code></pre>  <p>any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!</p>
