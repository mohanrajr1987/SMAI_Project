<p>I am having some weird trouble when I am trying to display an int in C with the printf() function. This is the code I am using  </p>  <pre><code>            printf("To compute pi enter n: ");             int n_term = 1;              printf("n: %d \n", &amp;n_term);              scanf("%d", &amp;n_term);             printf("n: %d", &amp;n_term); </code></pre>  <p>I realized there was an issue because when I try to simply print n_term back to the user, even before they input any value for n_term, it comes out with this giant number, 2686776. Any insight as to what the issue here would be greatly appreciated. I am using gcc compiler if that makes any difference.</p>
