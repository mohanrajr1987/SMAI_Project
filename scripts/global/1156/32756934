<p>I want to implement an invalid_parameter_handler in order to handle exceptions thrown by sprintf_s (buffer overflow).</p>  <p>I want to know some more information, such as in which method this sprintf_s was called.</p>  <p>I know that the signature of the handle method has to be :</p>  <pre><code>void myInvalidParameterHandler(const wchar_t* expression,     const wchar_t* function,     const wchar_t* file,     unsigned int line,     uintptr_t pReserved) </code></pre>  <p>but the parameter "function" will be of course "sprintf_s" (actually it will be _vsprintf_s_l).</p>  <p>Is there a way to pass this kind of information?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
