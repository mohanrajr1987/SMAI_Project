<p>I am trying to write C code to perform some mathematical calculation. I was using a printf statement to check the print the variable. When I was done with the code, and I was getting the desired output, I commented the line out. However, after doing that, I am not getting any output. Uncommenting the line gets the desired output back. </p>  <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include &lt;math.h&gt; #define M 1000  const double eps = 1.110223e-16; const double delta = 1.110223e-16;  void bisection(double (*fn)(double), double a, double b) {     //Bisection algorithm     double w, c, u, v, e;     int i;     u = (*fn)(a);     v = (*fn)(b);     e = b - a;      if(signbit(u) == signbit(v)) {         printf("Stopping due to same sign\n");         return;     }      for(i = 0; i &lt; M; i++) {         printf("%d\n", i);         e = e / 2;         c = a + e;         w = (*fn)(c);          //Stopping conditions epsilon and delta         if(abs(e) &lt;= eps || abs(w) &lt;=  delta) {             printf("Root is %e\n", c);             return;         }          if(signbit(w) == signbit(u)) {             //Means that root lies in [c,b]             a = c;             u = w;         } else {             // Means root lies in [a, b]             b = c;             v = w;         }     }  }  double problem_a(double x) {     return (pow(x, -1) - tan(x)); }  int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {     double (*fn)(double);     fn = &amp;problem_a;     bisection(fn, 0.0 + eps, M_PI/2 - eps);     return 0; } </code></pre>  <p>The output I am getting is: Root is 7.853982e-01 I get no output if I comment the file.</p>  <p>I am using the gcc compiler version 4.8.3</p>  <p>What can be a possible explanation for this behaviour? </p>
