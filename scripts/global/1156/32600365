<p>I have a <code>toString()</code> method from my class that takes the information from the object and puts it into a string to be printed.</p>  <p>This is what it should look like:</p>  <pre><code>Susan         70     &lt;Average   C Alexander     80     &gt;Average   B </code></pre>  <p>, but I'm having trouble formatting my <code>toString()</code> method. This is what it looks like this right now which is very unorganized.</p>  <pre><code>public String toString() {      return ("\n" + fullName +              "            " + relativeScore +             "            " + testScore);  } </code></pre>  <p>I would normally use printf, but since it's a return statement I can't use it. Any help would be much appreciated. </p>
