<p>I wrote some code to count the bits in a word. When I <code>printf()</code> the count it prints 32 as expected but when I stuck the same code in a function and printed the return value it gives me some crazy large number. </p>  <p>I then copy/pasted the code back into <code>main()</code> printed the count and printed the return value of my function at the same time and hey both gave me 32 but if I then comment out the code in <code>main()</code> my function again prints the large number. </p>  <p>Anyone have an idea about why this is happening?</p>  <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;  int wordlength();  int main() {  printf("%d", wordlength()); // prints 4195424 but                           // if I uncomment the code below                           // it then prints 32 like I want  //  int count; //  unsigned int n = ~0; //  //  while( n != 0) { //      n = n &gt;&gt; 1; //      count++; //  } //  printf("\n%d", count); // prints 32 as expected      return 0; }  int wordlength() {      int count;     unsigned int n = ~0;      while( n != 0) {         n = n &gt;&gt; 1;         count++;     }      return count; } </code></pre>
