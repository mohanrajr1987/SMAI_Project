<p>I was just wondering what would be the best way to find the intersection and union of two arrays that are the same size? They do not have to be in order, but there cannot be duplicates. For example, lets says the user enters 12 2 3 for the first and 2 3 4 for the second. The union would print 12234 and the intersection would be 23. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. </p>
