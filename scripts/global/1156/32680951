<p>Working on a project that requires something to be printed as "printf" but the next line then ends up on the same line as the previous one, how would I go about seperating these?</p>  <pre><code>System.out.print("Cost per course: "); double costPerCourse1; costPerCourse1 = keyboard.nextDouble(); System.out.printf("%.2f", costPerCourse1 + /n);  double tuition; tuition = numberOfClasses1 * costPerCourse1; System.out.println("Tuition: " + tuition); </code></pre>
