<p>I've tried to write a program which gets the highest character a person has entered. I made a program which gets the highest number work without any problem but with characters it doesn't work. Here's my code:</p>  <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include &lt;string.h&gt;  int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {     char characters[5];     char highest = "a";      printf("Please enter five characters: \n");     for (int i = 0; i &lt;= 4; i+=1) {         scanf("%c", characters[i]);     }      printf("These are the characters you entered: ");      for (int i = 0; i &lt;= 4; i+=1) {         printf("%c  ", characters[i]);     }      for (int i = 0; i &lt;= 4; i+=1) {         if (characters[i] &gt; highest) {             highest = characters[i];         }     }      printf("\nThe highest character is %c", highest); } </code></pre>  <p>What am I doing wrong?</p>
