<p>I am making a clock in java and I have to print 2 digits for the minutes and 2 digits for the seconds.  I am using printf to try to print the two values but I keep receiving an error saying "illegal statement" or "; exprected".  What am I doing wrong?</p>  <p>Below is the code that I have attempted to implement and has failed thus far.</p>  <pre><code>public void printStandard() {     int hours;      if (hrs &lt; 12) {         System.out.printf(hrs + ":" + mins + ":" + %2d + "AM", secs);     } else if (hrs &gt; 12) {         hours=hrs-12;         System.out.printf(hours + ":" + mins + ":" + %2d+ "PM"), secs;     } else if (hrs == 12) {         System.out.printf(hrs + ":" + mins + ":" + %2d, secs + "PM");     } } </code></pre>
