<p>I am writing the solution to a programming problem. The problem is as follows:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Your program is to use the brute-force approach in order to find the   Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything. More precisely...   rewrite small numbers from input to output. Stop processing input   after reading in the number 42. All numbers at input are integers of   one or two digits.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I have pasted my code below. I am getting segmentation fault when I submit this solution. Can someone point out what's wrong with this code? Any help will be much appreciated.</p>  <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;  int main(void) {     int number = 0;     while (1)     {         int c = getchar();         if (c != EOF)         {             number = number * 10 + c;         }         else         {             //const char value = number;             if (number != 42)             {                 printf(number);                 printf("\n");                 number = 0;             }             else             {                 return 0;             }         }     } } </code></pre>
