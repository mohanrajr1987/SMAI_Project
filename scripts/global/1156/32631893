I'm trying to figure out how to use printf with this char Buffer[65]. Essentially, my algorithm pulls in a value and base given by the user, then calculates what that number is in that base. If I change my printf to print out digit, it prints "123" for 57 base 4. So, I have it storing digit into the Buffer array in reverse (set int i to 63 because i set 64 to null).</p>  <p>Long story short, when it stores into the buffer, increments down, then returns to the while loop it doesn't print any text.</p>  <p>Edit: As I'm looking around, it looks like printf only prints ascii characters. So I need to convert digit to one of the characters in Table[16]?</p>
