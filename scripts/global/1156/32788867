<p>it seems like such a silly thing to ask but i seriously don't know why this is happening. Could be that it's almost 5am and i'm still doing this but.. </p>  <p>It should print -CA but why when i compile it, it is printing</p>  <pre><code>- CA? </code></pre>  <p>instead of -CA, there isn't a '\n' anywhere in sight.  Can you guys think of anything logical that would explain it?</p>  <pre><code>int main(int argc, char* argv[]){  int check = 0; char *thing = (char*)malloc(2 * sizeof(char));  strcpy(char, "CA");  some code..     do{      more code...      if(condition== 1) {             more code....              if(check == 0) {                  printf("-");                 check++;             }       if (some conditon != NULL){         printf("%s\n",thing);     }while(condition)   return 0; </code></pre>  <p>}</p>
