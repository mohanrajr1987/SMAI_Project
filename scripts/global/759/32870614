<p>I have a really simple app that uploads files to a remote server.</p>  <p>I would like to build a SDK, so that external apps can also use the app to upload files. I'm wondering what's the best thing to do for this SDK.</p>  <p>For now, the only thing I've found is to expose a Receiver with a "dangerous" permission in the main app (signature is not conceivable, because "client" apps does not have the same signature).</p>  <p>But I don't really like this solution, because apps without the sdk can also send Intent to the main app.</p>  <p>Do you have another solution for this kind of problem?</p>  <p>Thanks :)</p>
