<p>I come to you because I test for several days to make a background on which it is possible to apply a zoom / unzoom and which would also be navigable.</p>  <p>I try to reproduce what we find in "clash of clan" for example.</p>  <p>I tried with ScrollView widget or simply touch the event but I'm still the same problem.</p>  <p>My image that serves as my background is larger than the display capability of the screen and I can not restrict movement on both axes.</p>  <p>Should you have to give me a track to limit his movements.</p>  <p>I thank you in advance, Best regards !</p>
