<p>Everyone. Thank you very much.</p>  <p>I was using Google Map API in iOS.</p>  <p>It was used in X-Code 7.0 this time.</p>  <p>It's and is failed as follows.</p>  <p>What is the cause?</p>  <p>Would there be a countermeasure?</p>  <p>BITCODE succeeds in a build in NO. I'd like to make it a bundle by Apple Watch correspondence, so I have to make BITCODE YES and am in trouble. Thank you.</p>  <p>pod log</p>  <p>Ainetmakoto-no-MacBook-Pro:XcodeSorce ainetmakoto$ pod try GoogleMaps    Updating spec repositories CocoaPods 0.39.0.beta.4 is available.
