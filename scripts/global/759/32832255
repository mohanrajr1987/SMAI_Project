<p>Suppose I have my website (PHP Backend) with an account system created and I want to make it so that anyone can put a "Login with (my website name)" button on their page. Would I have to do it with an API or an SDK? And how exactly could I do it?  If you have any sources or tutorials on this, I'd appreciate it if you indicated it here. Thank you!</p>
