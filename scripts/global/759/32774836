<p>I have a site I am using the JS LinkedIn SDK. I am trying to minify the HTML but removing the line breaks from the LinkedIn SDK breaks it. This is the code they say to use:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="//platform.linkedin.com/in.js"&gt;     api_key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE     authorize: true     onLoad: onLinkedInLoad &lt;/script&gt; </code></pre>  <p>As far as I know this isn't even valid content for a script tag and I don't even know what a multimillion dollar company is doing this for. Any ideas on how to minify this? Thanks in advance!</p>
