<p>I just buy a Kinect for Xbox 360 with the USB adapter to connect to your computer. I downloaded the SDK 1.8 and I have seen that is the last compatible version , but I have several problems, the microphone recognizes me well and I've tried to record audio and recorded , but in the windows's devices I look in part of unspecified : Xbox and Xbox NUI Camera NUI Motor . </p>  <p>I try to throw in some Browser Developer Toolkit application and I get " device not found " even understand that I have to install any driver to recognize me the cameras and the engine, any help please ?</p>
