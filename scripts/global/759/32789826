<p>This must be a painfully simple question but I am new to IntelliJ. I am running 14.1 community, and created a new plugin project.</p>  <p>This asked me to set the SDK, which is install of IntelliJ. No problem, I pointed it at the IDEA directory.</p>  <p>I grabbed some example source for creating a task repository from github.</p>  <p>When I try to import any of the actual classes in the Task jar, I get no classdef errors all over. <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/upmrW.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/upmrW.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>It shows that it knows about <code>intellij.tasks</code> but all of the classes are missing. </p>  <p>What rookie mistake have I made?</p>
