<p>I have just downloaded the latest Android Studio for Mac. Now I am in the process of Adding SDK Packages. I am following the instructions provided on the Developers page for Android entitled "Adding SDK Packages:" I have successfully followed the instruction that states, "In Android Studio, click SDK Manager  in the toolbar." So now my location is "/Users/myname/Library/Android/sdk" which is the same as "Appearance &amp; Behavior > System Settings > Android SDK." Under "Get the latest SDK tools," one of the instructions states, "Open the first Android X.X folder." That folder doesn't exist. Under "Get the support library for additional APIs," the main instruction states "Open the Extras directory." That doesn't exist either. I have clicked various buttons but just can't find any of these directories anywhere. What am I doing wrong or does anyone know of any new instructions that I should be following instead?</p>  <p>ANSWER: The directories were discontinued and their contents were moved to "SDK Tools" which is a subdirectory of "Appearance &amp; Behavior > System Settings > Android SDK."</p>
