<p>My question is primarily because of a bug in 4.4 and earlier devices. More on it <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleCardboard/comments/3i3t4z/cardboard_app_connection_error_when_trying_to_set/" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleCardboard/comments/3kyrca/cardboard_vr_app_refuses_to_switch_viewer_type/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. </p>  <p>The gist is this </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Something changed recently with the goo.gl/ URL shortening service   that breaks the Cardboard app's own QR-code scanner. It only seems to   affect Android 4.4 and older versions.</p> </blockquote>  <p>What Im looking to do is add viewer profiles to these devices either using a script via adb or manually copy pasting needed files. </p>  <p>This is for a hackathon I'm organizing in 2 days so timely help is appreciated. Also if it helps the devices we are developing on will be rooted so changes to the filesystem are possible. </p>
