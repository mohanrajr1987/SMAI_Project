<p>I've recently discovered that Android M locks down the option to automatically allow users to draw over other apps, which is outlined in this article  <a href="http://www.androidpolice.com/2015/09/07/android-m-begins-locking-down-floating-apps-requires-users-to-grant-special-permission-to-draw-on-other-apps/" rel="nofollow">http://www.androidpolice.com/2015/09/07/android-m-begins-locking-down-floating-apps-requires-users-to-grant-special-permission-to-draw-on-other-apps/</a> </p>  <p>So I've tried to upgrade my API to 23 to account for this change. As outlined in this post <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32061934/permission-from-manifest-doesnt-work-in-android-6">Permission from manifest doesn&#39;t work in Android 6</a>. However, the Settings.canDrawOverlay() and others don't seem to appear in my Android SDK. I was wondering if I missed anything in upgrading my SDK. </p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
