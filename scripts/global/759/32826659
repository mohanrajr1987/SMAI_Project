<p>I'm new on LG smart TV apps. I've installed the SDK provided by LG (Oracle Virtual Box, Safari, Eclipse, sdk itself).</p>  <p>Now everything is running, but when I try to launch the emulator, a remote control is displayed, and on the virtualbox window, I see an error and no emulator is launched.</p>  <p>This is my plataform: Windows 7 on a intel i7, 8 gb ram Virtual Box 4.1.18 (I've installed 4.2.4 before, but sdk installer replace it to 4.1.18) Safari 5.1.7 Java JRE 1.6 LG Smart TV SDK 3.0.0</p>  <p>This is the log generated by Virtual Box:</p>  <p>VirtualBox 4.1.18 r78361 win.amd64 (Jun  5 2012 15:58:23) release log</p>  <p>00:00:05.144 Log opened 2015-09-28T15:09:54.564361900Z</p>  <p>00:00:05.144 OS Product: Windows 7</p>  <p>00:00:05.144 OS Release: 6.1.7601</p>  <p>00:00:05.144 OS Service Pack: 1</p>  <p>00:00:05.144 Host RAM: 7926MB RAM, available: 864MB</p>  <p>00:00:05.144 Executable: C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox\VirtualBox.exe</p>  <p>00:00:05.144 Process ID: 12536</p>  <p>00:00:05.144 Package type: WINDOWS_64BITS_GENERIC</p>  <p>00:00:05.145 Installed Extension Packs:</p>  <p>00:00:05.145   None installed!</p>  <p>00:00:05.156 Power up failed (vrc=VINF_SUCCESS, rc=E_FAIL (0X80004005))</p>  <p>00:00:05.439 ERROR [COM]: aRC=E_ACCESSDENIED (0x80070005) aIID={1968b7d3-e3bf-4ceb-99e0-cb7c913317bb} aComponent={Console} aText={The virtual machine is not powered up}, preserve=false</p>  <p>Is there any known issue about this? What is the reason because "Power up failed"? How can I fix the VM? Does this software really works on Windows?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
