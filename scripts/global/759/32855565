<p>I've been trying for days to compile a project which uses Windows.h, but cannot because it fails to find. I did provide additional include and lib directories for it, but noticed that all the SDKs I have downloaded only have the bin folder.</p>  <p>I've ran the installation for multiple SDKs now and all of them finished without failures, but I have four directories v7.0, 7.1A, 8.0A and 10.0A and none of them can provide me with the header files.</p>  <p>Any idea how to solve this? I'm afraid it might be related to running Windows 10.</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
