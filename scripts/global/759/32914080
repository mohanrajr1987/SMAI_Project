<p>Good evening,</p>  <p>I am currently working on making a Samsung Gear S2 APP using tizen sdk standalone (which works using HTML).</p>  <p>While working on this app we have an input (type number) to set a number, and all works fine by testing with the emulator, but when trying on a real device it seems the keyboard is showing Smilies when it should be showing just a conventional keyboard with numbers.</p>  <p>Can anyone help me with this error? Many thanks in advance</p>
