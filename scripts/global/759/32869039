<p>So Citrix left out their old .NET SDK framework such as the RunSpaceFactory and MFCOM in favor of a PowerShell SDK in 7.x.</p>  <p>I understand that powershell commands can be run using C# and other .NET languages.  The problem is, despite this PowerShell SDK being installed on this computer where I am using Visual Studio, I can't gain access to the commands as System.Management.Automation does not have these commands in the library. The commands are in some other library installed with the PowerShell SDK.</p>  <p>I can use them from the command prompt but that's about it.</p>  <p>How do I access these commands from .NET?</p>
