<p>I've an app for a community. In the app, I have links to their fb page, fb group and their blog.       App doesn't use facebook SDK and if you open app, you can also use whole fb. Under such conditions, will my app get banned ? If yes, is there any way to avpid it like any SDK etc. ? Thanks!</p>  <p>Regards, Sankarshan</p>
