<p>I am in the process of setting up a headless Ubuntu server to experiment with <a href="https://crosswalk-project.org/" rel="nofollow">Crosswalk</a>.  My first attempt was on a virtual server with 15Gb of disk space.  It came a cropper because I ran out of disk space during the <code>android update sdk --no-ui</code> step.  I was slightly taken aback at this but I decided to try again with a server with 20Gb of disk space.  Much to my surprise it consumed all of the 20Gb and gave up.</p>  <p>Clearly, this is not a viable route forward.  I could in principle get a VM with, say, a 100Gb disk but I would end up paying for something I don't need.  I observed what was happening during the install more carefully during my second attempt.  The <code>android update sdk</code> command gets a whole load of SDK APIs and the corresponding documentation all the way down to the distant Android Version 1 days.</p>  <p>I have no interest whatsoever in being able to compile APKs for anything lower than, say, Android 4.x.  I have checked the docs but been unable to find any mechanism for instructing <code>android update sdk</code> to be more specific in what it downloads.</p>  <p>The closest I have come to finding something useful is </p>  <pre><code>android update sdk --no-ui --filter android-XX &gt; /dev/null </code></pre>  <p>which I suspect sends the <code>android-XX</code> version to <code>/dev/null</code> oblivion.  However, it is not clear to me how/whether I can filter out everything less than, say, android-43.</p>  <p>I suspect this is possible but I am not sure how to go about it.  I would much appreciate any help.</p>
