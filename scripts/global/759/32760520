<p>I am working on an app that needs reliable push messages (like any voip) under ios9.  Here it says, that with IOS8+ one should use apns (registerForRemoteNotifications):</p>  <p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIApplication_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/UIApplication/setKeepAliveTimeout:handler" rel="nofollow">https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIApplication_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/UIApplication/setKeepAliveTimeout:handler</a>:</p>  <p>In the Optimize VOIP Apps document, Pushkit is preferred: </p>  <p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Performance/Conceptual/EnergyGuide-iOS/OptimizeVoIP.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015243-CH30-SW1" rel="nofollow">https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Performance/Conceptual/EnergyGuide-iOS/OptimizeVoIP.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015243-CH30-SW1</a></p>  <p>Does anybody have a clue on this?  Or do they run the same code in the background? </p>
