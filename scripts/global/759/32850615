<p>I have uninstalled ALL versions of Java on two PC'a.  Then used a registry cleaner to remove all dead links and bad reg entries.</p>  <p>I then installed 64 bit versions of Java jdk and jre on both.</p>  <p>I then restarted both.</p>  <p>I then installed Android SDk to both.</p>  <p>Both PC are Windows 7 Home Edition 64bit. Just different hardware specs.</p>  <p>On one the SDK Manager works when I open it, it takes time but opens up by double clicking and WITHOUT setting any environmental variables etc...</p>  <p>On the other one it just doesnt work, even after settign JAVA_HOME variables etc...</p>  <p>What is the solution?</p>  <p>I am trying to figure any other differences like in the registry etc..  cant find any.</p>  <p>They both have "C:\ProgramData\Oracle\Java\javapath" in the PATH environmental variable settings.</p>
