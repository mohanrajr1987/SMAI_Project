<p>I have created <code>ubuntu</code> droplet on Digital Ocean. Configured it and installed <code>Vesta</code> panel. I have also created few email accounts in the <code>Vesta</code>. Now I want to configure fetch/send mail with <code>Gmail</code>. </p>  <p>I have done this and it works, but when I configured this I set as mail server domain my real domain like <code>mydomain.com</code>. But looks like it's wrong, must be something like <code>smtp.mydomain.com</code> and <code>pop.mydomain.com</code>.</p>  <p>So it works for now, but how can I configure my Droplet to work with mail subdomains and close possibility to use directly <code>mydomain.com</code>?</p>
