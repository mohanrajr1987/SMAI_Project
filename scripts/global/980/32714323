<p>I am using grails mail plug-in <strong>compile ":mail:1.0.7"</strong> with the following configuration in the Config.groovy</p>  <pre><code>grails {     mail {         host = "smtp.gmail.com"         port = 465         username = "email@example.com"         password = "password"         props = ["mail.smtp.auth" : "true",                  "mail.smtp.socketFactory.port"    : "465",                  "mail.smtp.socketFactory.class"   : "javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory",                  "mail.smtp.socketFactory.fallback": "false",                  "mail.smtp.connectiontimeout"     : 1000]         } } grails.mail.default.from="email@example.com" </code></pre>  <p>I have added my other alias email addresses as other email addresses I own under <em>Gmail account -> settings -> accounts -> Send mail as:</em></p>  <p>What I get from the plug-in documentation is that email address mentioned against <strong>grails.mail.default.from</strong> will be used as default mail address until I provide an other email address in against <strong>from :</strong> while sending email.</p>  <p>Such as :</p>  <pre><code>mailService.sendMail {     to "fred@g2one.com","ginger@g2one.com"     from "john@g2one.com"     subject "Hello John"     body 'this is some text' } </code></pre>  <p>But it doesn't work like that in my case it continues to send emails from email address mentioned against <strong>grails.mail.default.from</strong> and does not override the email address mentioned against <strong>from</strong> while sending mail.</p>
