<p>I'm trying to using Google's API to send an email. I have a web application powered by AngularJS where the user signs in with their google account (via passport.js) using oauth2. A new access token is written to their account on my database. Their google user ID is also written to their account. I'd like the user to be able to send an email via an HTTP request using simply their user Id and access token. I'm using Postman to make some test requests, but I keep getting this error:</p>  <pre><code>{   "error": {     "errors": [       {         "domain": "global",         "reason": "insufficientPermissions",         "message": "Insufficient Permission"       }     ],     "code": 403,     "message": "Insufficient Permission"   } } </code></pre>  <p>I'm using the following link to make a POST request:</p>  <pre><code>https://content.googleapis.com/gmail/v1/users/106xxxxxxxxxxx/messages/send </code></pre>  <p>In my header, I have:</p>  <pre><code>Authorization: Bearer yaxx._wxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Content-Type: application/json </code></pre>  <p>My body:</p>  <pre><code>{  "raw": "test" } </code></pre>  <p>I've had some of the emails intermittently come in using this method, but I can't seem to recreate a successful request with certainty. I'm a little confused by Google's documentation. Do I need to explicitly grant access as seen in the example at the bottom of <a href="https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/v1/reference/users/messages/send" rel="nofollow">this page</a>?</p>
