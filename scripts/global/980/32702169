<p>i have a website, its like diary, where i add new info every day. i store flashcards there, for my study. and they are very important. to make them safe, i build up script, which will send me all that database txt file to my gmail account , every time when i create new flashcard . so daily i gonna create 200-300 flashcards , and totally i expect 5000-6000 cards or even more. hence it will send to my mail 6000 files. those cards are very little , and txt will be maximum few kb. but i wonder, will gmail place that mail to black list, spam list and block it ? plz give some info , and sorry for my bad english</p>
