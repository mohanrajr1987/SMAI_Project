<p>I can open emails using python (imap and mail modules), mostly following the advice here: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1463074/how-can-i-get-an-email-messages-text-content-using-python">How can I get an email message&#39;s text content using python?</a></p>  <p>But I need to print only the first line of every email body - how could i do that? </p>  <pre><code>    for part in email_message.walk():     # each part is a either non-multipart, or another multipart message     # that contains further parts... Message is organized like a tree     if part.get_content_type() == 'text/plain':         print part.get_payload() # prints the raw text </code></pre>  <p>this is what i currently have to print the body, any ideas how I could restrict that to the first line of the email? </p>
