<p>Has anyone done something every simply around retrieving emails from a gmail account with node.js or mocha? There are a few modules around, all with some complexity in the setup, which is understandable. The official google api docs show a fair bit of code. We are setting up unit tests for a system that sends alert emails, and we just want to ensure that the email is sent, arrived, and contains 'x' in the body. We are using mocha to do the tests. Any thoughts appreciated.</p>
