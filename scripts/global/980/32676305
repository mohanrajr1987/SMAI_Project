<p>I had one of my domain hixpert.com which I bought from bigrock, hosted on bigrock single hosting plan (US). I also had a google app acount for gmail services for my domain. Every thing was working perfertly in last one year.</p>  <p>Now I took an multidomain hosting plan (India) on another domain of mine "hixpert.in" . The problem starts when I tried porting hixpert.com which was in US hosting to my new India multidomain hosting as an addon domain.</p>  <p>For that when I changed on DNS servers in hixpert.com  from </p>  <blockquote>   <p>dns1.bigrock.in (US)   to => (INDIA)   ns1.md-in-24.webhostbox.net </p> </blockquote>  <p>My google mails to my hixpert.com domain stared bouncing. with followin message.</p>  <p><em>Technical details of permanent failure: Google tried to deliver your message, but it was rejected by the server for the recipient domain hixpert.com by hixpert.com. [103.21.58.112]. The error that the other server returned was: 550 No Such User Here</em></p>  <p>I checked my MX records which are needed for gmail to work for hixpert.com which are perfectly ok.</p>  <pre><code>*1 28138496 hixpert.com 1 aspmx.l.google.com Active 2 28138521 hixpert.com 5 alt1.aspmx.l.google.com Active 3 28138525 hixpert.com 5 alt2.aspmx.l.google.com Active 4 28138539 hixpert.com 10 aspmx2.googlemail.com Active 5 28138547 hixpert.com 10 aspmx3.googlemail.com Active* </code></pre>  <p>The email starts working fine when I revert to old DNS server settings dns1.bigrock.in (US).</p>  <p>Please help me know the solution to this problem. How can I point my domain to my multi domain hosting without disturbing my google mail services.</p>  <p>Regards.</p>
