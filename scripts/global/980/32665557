<p>I've got a simple registration process implemented on my website - user enters email in registration form and system sends on that email confirmation link with some random hash to complete checkout. Link looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>http://somedomain.com/registration_confirm/1/be770f0a002f181deedcb3d8da2f9f638579ace3fe218251fe3558824ba548d2 </code></pre>  <p>also, in email template:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;a href="{{ url('registration_confirm', { '_locale': app.request.locale, 'readerId': readerId, 'registrationDigest': registrationDigest }) }}"&gt;     {{ 'registration.link'|trans({}, "emails") }} &lt;/a&gt; </code></pre>  <p>When it's got delivered on <strong>Gmail</strong>, and I click that link - something strange happens: target page is loaded twice. So I get to the <code>registration_confirm</code> route, and than browser loads <code>registration_confirm</code> route again. Which is problem, because on second load link is not valid anymore, and user sees an error.</p>  <p><strong>Symfony2</strong> is the framework, and my route definition looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>/**  * @Method({"GET"})  * @Route(  *      "/registration_confirm/{readerId}/{registrationDigest}",  *      name="registration_confirm",  *      host="{domain}",  *      defaults={"_locale" = "%locale%", "domain" = "%domain%"},  *      requirements={"_locale" = "%locale%", "domain" = "%domain%", "readerId" = "\d+", "registrationDigest" = "[a-f0-9]{64}"}  * )  */ </code></pre>  <p>Checked across different browsers - same result. Checked with different email services - <em>all except Gmail works as expected</em>, so I assume that Gmail itself does something unwanted.</p>  <p>Appreciate any thoughts about this issue, because for now it looks like voodoo magic.</p>
