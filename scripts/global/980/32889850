<p>I have the following questions on how i can manage my cloud hosting infrastructure. currently i completed an asp.net mvc website for one of our customers, and we want to host it to one of the hosting companies. the current situation is as follow:-</p>  <ol> <li><p>Our customer has already bought a domain name (for example <code>www.123.com</code>) from Godaddy 3 years ago.</p></li> <li><p>Also they have created some email addresses with in the domain name such as <code>info@123.com</code>.</p></li> <li><p>they configure to access their emails using <code>gmail.</code> so currently they are accessing their domain emails such as (info@123.com) from gmail interface .</p></li> <li><p>currently if i try to access their domain name <code>www.123.com</code> i will get this page (as currently they do not have any website)</p></li> </ol>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/XSgSk.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/XSgSk.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>so i have the following questions on how i can manage the new web site deployment:-</p>  <ol> <li><p>Let say i login to their Godaddy account and i chose a plan for asp.net mvc, then i deploy the asp.net mvc web site to godaddy. will this affect their current emails addresses or current emails stored inside their inboxes and Sent folders ? i mean by affect will they still access their emails as they are currently doing ?</p></li> <li><p>second question which i am confused about. now they purchased the domain name from Godaddy and they renew it every year. but when i access their domain name using the following url <code>www.123.com</code>, i will get the above picture which gives an indication that the domain is within google and not within godaddy ... does this gives any indication ?</p></li> </ol>
