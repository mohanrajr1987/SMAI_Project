<p>I have been following the rails tutorial by Michael Hartl for some time. When I came to the point of creating account activation links and automatically send them in an Email, I noticed some bad stuff:</p>  <p>I'm using the cloud 9 ide and the activation link from the Email <strong>only</strong> works when the cloud 9 project is <strong>private</strong>. Since I need to store the password for my gmail account in the configs, everyone can view my code and log in to my gmail account. </p>  <p>How could this problem be solved? Making the project private doesn't work because you then aren't able to activate your account.</p>
