<p>I did try to look for an answer, but gained unsatisfactory results - if someone finds a perfectly good answer, don't kill me.</p>  <p>So, basically, I've set up an email intent and have tried to launch it.</p>  <pre><code>    public void emailSummary(String emailText, String name) {         Intent emailIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_SEND);         emailIntent.setData(Uri.parse("mailto:"));         emailIntent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_EMAIL, "");         emailIntent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_SUBJECT, "JustJava order for " + name);         emailIntent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT, emailText);         Log.v("MainActivity", "Finished setting up intent");         if (emailIntent.resolveActivity(getPackageManager()) != null) {             startActivity(emailIntent);             Log.v("MainActivity", "Sharing the order summary to email");         } else {             Log.d("MainActivity", "No email app installed!");             Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this, "Uh...No email app?", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();         } </code></pre>  <p>However, when I do press the Order button, the "Uh... No email app?" toast shows up. I have both Inbox and Gmail installed and have tried a series of combinations (Inbox only, Inbox and Gmail, Gmail only), only to find that the Intent doesn't seem to care at all.</p>  <p>Anybody help?</p>
