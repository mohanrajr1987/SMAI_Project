<p>Please I need a help because this problem is really killed me ...    When I send an Email with PHPMAILER using localhost on Wamp server with a non English text ,The receiver shows the Email as is (The body and subject) but TO name is shows as a numbers and hashes(symboles) , This name  was got from POST[] </p>  <p>Now, if i write a text directly to a variable then it received as is ($variable='Arabic name';) this sends correctly(the name TO is true). This what i got when getting the name from POST!</p>  <pre><code>from:correct in any language&lt;my@gmail.com&gt; reply-to:   Information &lt;info@example.com&gt; to: "&amp;#1605;&amp;#1581;&amp;#1605;&amp;#1583;" &lt;my@gmail.com&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I don't know why the receiver name is converted to symbols like that.</p>  <pre><code>$mail-&gt;CharSet = 'UTF-8'; $mail-&gt;Encoding     = "base64"; </code></pre>  <p>And as i mentioned above ALL Email elements(body,subject and sender name) are correct.</p>
