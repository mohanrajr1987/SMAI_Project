<p>I quite new to Laravel, am forced to use a Google Apps email with custom domain (admin@domain.com) in Laravel 5 as per client request, and I am at a bit of a loss. I set up my .env file as such:</p>  <pre><code>MAIL_DRIVER=smtp MAIL_HOST=stmp.gmail.com MAIL_PORT=587 MAIL_USERNAME=admin@domain.com MAIL_PASSWORD=my_password MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls </code></pre>  <p>From here I know I should be setting the values of my app/mail.php but don't know what should match and what should be different. Any help would be really appreciated!</p>
