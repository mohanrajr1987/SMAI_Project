<p>I have the following code, which tries to send a mail with a .pdf file attached. This .pdf is located in my Google drive.</p>  <pre><code>var files = DriveApp.getFilesByName('file_test.pdf'); GmailApp.sendEmail(email, subject, message, {attachments:files[0]}); </code></pre>  <p>I've found that "getFilesByName" returns an array, so that's why I'm using files[0], but it's still not working. I don't know how to debug it, so when I'm testing my code, I am able to send the mail, but I receive it with no attached files.</p>
