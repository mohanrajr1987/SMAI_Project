<p>If understood correctly, a user can have the option of creating a gmail email address with a non-gmail email (<a href="https://accounts.google.com/signup" rel="nofollow">SignUp</a>). </p>  <p>However hotmail/outlook addresses filter spam poorly. On many occasions, emails don't even enter the junk or inbox folders. This is very troublesome. </p>  <p>If an old hotmail/outlook address is used for the gmail signup. Do the emails still go through hotmail/outlook's filters, so is gmail just copying all emails that the account receives, OR do emails now go through gmail's filters?</p>
