<p>I have configured droplet on Digital Ocean and install <code>Vesta</code> panel on it. All works good and I have created few email accounts in <code>Roundcube</code>. I can receive e-mails now and read them in the <code>Roundcube</code>. But I want to fetch my e-mails with <code>GMail</code>. How can I do this? How I must to configure POP server access in the Gmail settings?</p>  <p>Now I have tried:</p>  <pre><code>Server: pop.mydomain.com Port: 110 Login: support@mydomain.com </code></pre>
