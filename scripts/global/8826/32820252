<p>I am trying to get my device ID in the simulator of Telerik with Cordova:</p>  <pre><code> localStorage.setItem("Device id", device.uuid); </code></pre>  <p>Yet this is what I get in my watch in the debugger:</p>  <pre><code>"device.uuid: &lt;not available&gt;" </code></pre>  <p>Same goes for device.name or window.device.uuid etc.. I could not find anything on their sites or on google/stackoverflow. Does anyone know why this is not working, or how to get a unique ID from a device?</p>
