<p>I need to check for possible duplicate addresses in a table called User.  To do so I am using a JOIN then comparing tables for the first set of street numbers in an address string.  For example "123 First Street" and "123 First St." need to be identified as a possible match/duplicate.  </p>  <p>However I also need the Telerik RadGrid displaying the records to have a unique DataKeyName to identify the row for a double click javascript function to work.</p>  <p>Because of the JOIN my normal Primary Key's are duplicated in "both" tables a and b.  How can I create a temporary psuedo Primary Key using SQL just so my datagrid can identify the row double clicked on?</p>  <pre><code>    try     {         //Select Query to populate the RadGrid.            string selectQuery =              "SELECT " +             //We rename the dbo.User table as "a" then rename it again as "b" so we can look for duplicate Street Address numbers             "a.Id AS LeftID,a.DateSubmitted AS LeftDateSubmitted,a.Updated AS LeftUpdated," +             "a.Status AS LeftStatus,a.StreetAddress AS LeftStreetAddress," +              "b.Id AS RightID,b.DateSubmitted AS RightDateSubmitted,b.Updated AS RightUpdated," +             "b.Status AS RightStatus,b.StreetAddress AS RightStreetAddress " +              //We join the 2 virtual dbo.User tables where table b Id's are greater than table a meaning b records are newer             "FROM [User] a JOIN [User] b ON b.Id &gt; a.Id AND " +              //LEFT selects the left most characters (usually numbers) in the StreetAddress field string before the space ' '             //and eliminates the rest of the address isolating just the street address numbers for matching             "LEFT(a.StreetAddress,CHARINDEX(' ',a.StreetAddress)) = LEFT(b.StreetAddress,CHARINDEX(' ',b.StreetAddress)) " +              //Don't show orange or blue status records             "AND b.Status != 'Orange' AND a.Status != 'Orange' AND a.Status != 'Blue' AND b.Status != 'Blue' " +              //If a b record (newer) is red then ignore because it is completed and ignore a records (oldest) older than 90 days             "WHERE a.DateSubmitted &gt;= (GetDate() - 90) AND b.Status != 'Red' " +              //Show newest records first             "ORDER BY b.DateSubmitted DESC"             ;          SqlDataAdapter.SelectCommand = new SqlCommand(selectQuery, SqlConnection);         SqlDataAdapter.Fill(dtTable);         RadGrid1.DataSource = dtTable; </code></pre>
