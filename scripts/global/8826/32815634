<p>I have a web site. In site master page I use Telerik RadScriptManager.When I add a web service to it works well.But I want to add the web service in each page. Each page is ascx. I found ScriptManagerProxy but when I put it in ascx I can't call from Java script and if I put ScriptManagerProxy in site master it works. I want to add the web service in each page  What should I do? </p>
