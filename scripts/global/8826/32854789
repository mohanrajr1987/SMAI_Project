<p>I have a RadGrid with a GridEditCommandColumn.  I'd like to have the EditText property of each row change based on the contents of the row.  Eg, change EditText from 'Edit' to 'Edit Product' or 'Edit Bundle' based on the contents of the row.</p>  <p>I tried using databinding syntax but got an error saying that it doesn't support databinding.</p>  <p><strong>Is there an event I can hook into to change the value of EditText programmatically per row?</strong></p>
