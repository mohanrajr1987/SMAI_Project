<p>I want to select multiple parts of rows in the RadGridView by ctrl+drag like this<a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/HKCfZ.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/HKCfZ.png" alt="Select Two Parts of rows by ctrl +drag"></a></p>  <p>I set the selectionMode as extended but range selection resets previously selected rows each time when i tried to select new rows. For example, 2-6 will unselected when I use drag from 9 to 13 in the above image How to make this works?</p>
