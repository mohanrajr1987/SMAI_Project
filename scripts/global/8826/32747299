<p>I would like to go through every cell in a RadGridView and see if its value is equal to a string.</p>  <p>It should work like a find tool (ctrl + f). The user type something and I try to find what was typed in the cells. Is there anyway of doing this? Or a easiest way?</p>  <pre><code>if(text == cell.value) {     //do whatever I want } </code></pre>  <p>I've read this one: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24264290/search-for-value-in-radgridview-using-c-sharp-just-finds-values-in-first-row-of">Search for value in radGridView using C# just finds values in first row of radGridView</a> But my RadGridView does not contain properties such as "Rows" or even the class GridViewRowInfo. I have already tried something like that, however this properties don't exist in my grid.</p>
