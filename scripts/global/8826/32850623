<p>I am having an occasional problem with a radGridView where items that I add to an observable collection are not shown in the grid until I mouse over where it should be. Most of the time it works fine, but It is happening enough that it needs to be addressed. Calling rebind doesn't make any difference.</p>  <p>What could be causing the grid to not update until the mouse is moved?</p>
