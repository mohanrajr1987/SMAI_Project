<p>I am using Telerik WPF Controls 2014.2.729.40. I have enabled the multi-rows selection in the radgridview by setting SelectionMode="Extended". </p>  <pre><code>    &lt;tk:RadGridView              ...                 SelectionMode="Extended"     &gt; </code></pre>  <p>The user can select all or select multiple rows in the grid. However, if the user clicks out of the radgridview. The selected rows appear as unselected until the radgridview regains the focus back. </p>  <p>Here is how it looks like.</p>  <p>Step 1: The user selected multiple rows in telerik radgridview. </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/u0RNJ.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/u0RNJ.jpg" alt="user selected the rows"></a></p>  <p>Step 2: The user clicked outside of telerik radgridview. For example here the user click the green spot 1. <strong>Now the rows looked unselected.</strong></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/hbjey.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/hbjey.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Step 3: The user clicked back in the blank area of the radgridview. For example here the user click the green spot 2. The rows appeared selected as desired.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/xiZjG.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/xiZjG.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I want the selected rows stay SELECTED visually all the time no matter if the Telerik RadGridView lost focus or not. I have searched on the web and Telerik website and no luck to find the solutions. Please let me know if there is any ways to achieve my goal. Any help is appreciated.</p>
