<p>I have a WPF application that contains telerikRadDataForms with the usual sort of controls, TextBlocks, TextBoxes, a number of telerik:RadGridViews, etc.</p>  <p>These forms may be displayed in read-only or can be editable. My problem is that my users want to be able to select, then copy to the clipboard, text that is displayed in the TextBoxes, when the forms are in read-only mode, and the controls are disabled.</p>  <p>The problem is that the textboxes aren't selectable, and hence the users can't copy the text that is in them.</p>  <p>Anyone have any ideas?</p>
