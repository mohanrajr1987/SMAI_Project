<p>I am trying to install the <code>fpc</code> package on linux os. I got the error:</p>  <pre><code>dependencies ‘mclust’, ‘prabclus’, ‘mvtnorm’, ‘robustbase’, ‘kernlab’ are not available for package ‘fpc’ </code></pre>  <p>Then I tried to install <code>mclust</code> first, and I got <code>ERROR: compilation failed for package ‘mclust’</code></p>  <p>I suspect OS is missing some files, but not sure how to fix. Can anybody help? Many thanks!</p>
