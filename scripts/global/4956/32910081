<p>I'm using git to transfer files between test server and live server.  first i used to commit updates from test to the repo (Master) then pull updated from repo(Master) to live server then the whole live website down and when i try to edit any controller or any file i can not do that although the files have the same permissions.all what i can do is deleting the file and create it again with the same content. </p>  <p>can any one help me . thanks </p>
