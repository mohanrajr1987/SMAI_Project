<p>I installed instant client for Linux x86-64, and added the following to my <code>.bashrc</code>:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>export LD_LIBRARY_PATH =/home/wyl/instantclient_12_1:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH<br>   export PATH=/home/wyl/instantclient_12_1:$PATH"</p> </blockquote>  <p>I've also added ojdbc7.jar to my application, but it still results in <code>java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError</code>.</p>  <p>What could be the problem here?</p>
