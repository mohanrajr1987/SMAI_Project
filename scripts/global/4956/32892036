<p>I'm setting up Firewall with a CentOs 6.0 for testing. I'm doing this on two virtualmachines.</p>  <p>First VM (Firewall) has 2 interface:  eth0 - connected to NAT with 10.0.2.10, access to internet  eth1 - connected to local vm network with 20.0.0.1</p>  <p>Second VM (Server) has 1 interface:  eth0 - connected to local vm network with 20.0.0.2, GATEWAY 20.0.0.1.</p>  <p>They both have static ip's and dns. What I want to do is that Server have inet access via Firewall VM, to do that I've done those configurations:</p>  <p>VM1-Firewall: /etc/sysctl.conf net.ipv4.ip_forward 1 iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING --out-interface eth0 -j MASQUERADE iptables -A FORWARD --in-interface eth1 -j ACCEPT</p>  <p>VM2-Server: Just set that the gateway is the firewall 20.0.0.1 and DNS is 8.8.8.8</p>  <p>When I try to ping, for example, 8.8.8.8 it says Destination Host Prohibited.</p>  <p>Could anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong? I think it's iptables doesnt redirect traffic from eth1 to eth0 but it should do with this config, no?</p>  <p>Thanks a lot!</p>
