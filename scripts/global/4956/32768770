<p>I know in java-fx to make the window transparent, you need to set the stage style as <code>stage.initStyle(StageStyle.TRANSPARENT);</code>. However this will also remove any stage decorations so this does not solve my problem.</p>  <p>The reason I need this is because my application will need to use <code>stage.setAlwaysOnTop();</code> at certain points, but this feature is not well supported on the target system (centOS). The application also requires <code>stage.setIconnified();</code>, but this does not work if the stage is undecorated.</p>  <p>Any suggestions will be appreciated.  Thanks </p>
