<p>We have one CentOS7 or RedHat 7 "BIG" HP Proliant DL360 Gen 9 server with 4 NICs, two external switches Switch 1 and Switch 2 and many "small" servers.</p>  <p>Those small servers have two NICs: those NICs send exact the same traffic through each NIC to different switches. NIC1 is connected to Switch 1 and NIC2 to Switch 2. So we get redundancy with small servers: each server sends the same traffic through two switches towards one "BIG" server....</p>  <p>I tried to understand if I can by using teaming on BIG server create such configuration, for example:</p>  <p>NIC1 and NIC2 are team1, two NICs need for 2Gbps bandwidth.. NIC3 and NIC4 are team2 here is exactly the same mirrored 2 Gbps traffic...</p>  <p>Each team has the same traffic - and somehow (how?) we need to "know" or maybe define initial ACTIVE team. WE have to switch to another team if, for example Switch 1 dies, or even if on cable/NIC stops work, failed even if cable is taken out of connector..</p>  <p>Application on BIG server should not notice it because it wants to see just one static IP all the time, independently which team is ACTIVE and which is passive..</p>  <p>My question: is it possible to configure our BIG by using "teaming" in the way I described above or we need to buy some High Availability 3rd Party SW?</p>  <p>Thank you for your attention :-)</p>
