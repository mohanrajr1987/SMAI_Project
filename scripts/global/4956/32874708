<p>I just installed php 5.6 on a test box, and the normal cli php interpreter doesn't appear to exist:</p>  <pre><code>$ -&gt; php -v -bash: php: command not found  $ -&gt; php56 -v PHP 5.6.13 (cli) (built: Sep  3 2015 13:41:04)     </code></pre>  <p>If I try to do a <code>yum install php --enablerepo=remi</code> then it tries to install php 5.4. </p>  <p>So it's obvious that php56 is a cli interpreter, but I've always been used to just typing <code>php</code> vs <code>php56</code>. Is this the new norm, or is there another step for installing php56 on CentOS (6.7)? Is it as simple as creating a symlink? <code>ln -s /usr/bin/php56 /usr/bin/php</code></p>  <p>Steps to upgrade:</p>  <pre><code>$ -&gt; yum remove php* --enablerepo=remi  $ -&gt; yum install php56* --enablerepo=remi </code></pre>  <p>Thx to Remi for the push in the right direction, here's what my repo config looks like:</p>  <pre><code>[upstream_remi54] name=Remi - CentOS - $releasever/$arch  baseurl=http://mirrors.mediatemple.net/remi/enterprise/$releasever/remi/$basearch/ enabled=0  gpgcheck=1  gpgkey=http://rpms.famillecollet.com/RPM-GPG-KEY-remi  [upstream_remi56] name=Remi - CentOS - $releasever/$arch baseurl=http://mirrors.mediatemple.net/remi/enterprise/$releasever/php56/$basearch/ enabled=0  gpgcheck=1  gpgkey=http://rpms.famillecollet.com/RPM-GPG-KEY-remi </code></pre>  <p>This works well if you want to completely replace existing PHP, vs running versions in parallel. I have to keep PHP 5.4 in place for Roundcube and Postfix Admin, as some of the modules necessary for those to work have not yet been ported, so that server has to stay 5.4 for now.  </p>
