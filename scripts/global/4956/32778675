<p>I'm using a machine with CentOS to run some calculations. Memory is not being released after the process is over and eventually I run out of it. I've killed all processes belonging to all users (except for root) to make sure there are no sneaky background tasks hogging memory. Apparently, the machine is as idle as it can be, with only some daemons using a few MB of memory. And yet the vmstat command shows something different.</p>  <pre><code>   129051 M total memory     74241 M used memory     40047 M active memory     31511 M inactive memory     54810 M free memory       425 M buffer memory     71111 M swap cache      8191 M total swap        45 M used swap      8146 M free swap </code></pre>  <p>How do I find out which process is using all that memory and how do I stop it?</p>
