<p>I need help to setup to my hosting server Rocket Chat via SSH. I have: CentOS release 6.7(final)/PHP 5.4.45/MySQL Server 5.5.42/Apache 2.2.15 If you can step by step what I need to install and how to make the configuration. Thank you in advance.  I found the answer to a question on installation of ssh, but I would like to detail (in steps) This is my first post, if there are errors, not much to criticize.</p>
