<p>I'm trying to get forever installed on a centos server I'm running on AWS and having no luck. When I run "forever start bin/www"</p>  <pre><code> warn:    --minUptime not set. Defaulting to: 1000ms  warn:    --spinSleepTime not set. Your script will exit if it does not stay up for at least 1000ms  info:    Forever processing file: bin/www </code></pre>  <p>but as soon as I do that, if I run "forever list" I get </p>  <pre><code>info:    Forever processes running data:        uid  command             script  forever pid  id logfile                         uptime   data:    [1] SvwP /usr/local/bin/node bin/www 5986    5987    /home/centos/.forever/SvwP.log STOPPED  </code></pre>  <p>Anyone have any ideas? It's very frustrating, anything I have tried hasn't fixed it. Are there alternatives I could use to "forever"?</p>
