<p>I am trying to get rsyslog to send a specific logfile to a remote server over TCP.( centos 6.5) This is the rsyslog.conf file for the sending server:</p>  <p>/var/log/myApp.log  -- is my application log 10.10.10.10:514 -- is destination server (modified)</p>  <pre><code>#### RULES ####  # Log all kernel messages to the console. # Logging much else clutters up the screen. #kern.*                                                 /dev/console  # Log anything (except mail) of level info or higher. # Don't log private authentication messages! *.info;mail.none;authpriv.none;cron.none                /var/log/messages  # The authpriv file has restricted access. authpriv.*                                              /var/log/secure  LOCAL1.*                                              /var/log/myApp.log # Log all the mail messages in one place. mail.*                                                  -/var/log/maillog   # Log cron stuff cron.*                                                  /var/log/cron  # Everybody gets emergency messages *.emerg                                                 *  # Save news errors of level crit and higher in a special file. uucp,news.crit                                          /var/log/spooler  # Save boot messages also to boot.log local7.*                                                /var/log/boot.log   # ### begin forwarding rule ### # The statement between the begin ... end define a SINGLE forwarding # rule.
