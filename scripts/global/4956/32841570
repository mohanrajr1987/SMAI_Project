<p>Python version:2.7 OS: CentOS</p>  <p>I have a python project with multiple files spread across different directories. I am able to run this through Eclipse(PyDev). However I am unable to run it from linux shell.</p>  <p>The directory structure looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>      Projectrepo           |           |         __|__     src       conf      |          |      |          |  buildexec.py   |                 |              script_variables, list_of_scripts </code></pre>  <p><code>buildexec.py</code> is my main script. <code>script_variables</code> and <code>list_of_scripts</code> are two modules which I am referencing from buildexec.py. </p>  <p>I have included <code>from conf.script_variables import *</code> in my main script and it is working fine when I run it on eclipse. But, when I try to run it on shell, I get an error </p>  <p><code>'Traceback (most recent call last):   File "buildexec.py", line 6, in &lt;module&gt;     from conf.script_variables import * ImportError: No module named conf.script_variables'</code></p>  <p>I have added PYTHONPATH=/usr/bin/python2.7 and have exported it.. </p>  <p>Also, in the main script, I have added </p>  <p><code>sys.path.append('/home/tejas/Projectrepo/conf')</code> before importing the modules.</p>
