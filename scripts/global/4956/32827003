<p>I'm trying to install and configure a freeipa server on a centos 7 machine with many opensuse 13.2 client machines on a computer room in my job, the problem is when i try to login in in centos with the free ipa user previously configured, opensuse says me that the user doesn't exists.</p>  <p>Some could help with this problem?, maybe with an step an step guide or somethins like that.</p>  <p>Psdt: I'm a new on linux, and excuse me for my little poor english.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
