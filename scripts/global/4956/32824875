<p>So ive installed a brand new php handler for my plesk and registered it with plesk accordingly.</p>  <p>Now when i switch the php handler for one of my domains to the new 5.4 fastcgi it causes an internal server error 500.</p>  <p>This is not a fastcgi problem since 5.3 runs good on fastgci. It only happens with 5.4.</p>  <p>Also i took a brand new 5.4 php.ini for this domain so that cant be it either. Anyone has any idea?</p>
