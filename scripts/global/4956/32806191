<p>Yesterday I installed <strong>LEMP</strong> (php, mariaDB and so one) through SSH(Putty). Surprisingly  today SSH doesn't work anymore. I got the error connection established, so I looked it up on the internet and found that I had to start/restart sshd but if I run the command </p>  <pre><code>service sshd start/restart  </code></pre>  <p>I'll get this error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Failed to issue methode call: Unit sshd.service failed to load: No such file or directory</p> </blockquote>  <p>So it looks like my SSH just disappeared. How can I fix that?</p>  <p>I'm running Centos7</p>
