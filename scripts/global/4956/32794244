<p>lost some important data from my server and I know that data was sended via email. I have root access and I need to recover those emails.</p>  <p>I looked into exim logs and I have the email ID, but when I use a command like:</p>  <pre><code>root@server [/var/spool/exim/msglog]# exim -Mvh 1ZfRwk-003bDf-JB </code></pre>  <p>Failed to open input file for 1ZfRwk-003bDf-JB-H: No such file or directory.</p>  <p>Logs looks like:</p>  <pre><code>2015-09-25 08:17:50 1ZfRwk-003bDf-JB &lt;= info@myserver.com U=username P=local S=7453 id=20150925121750.117390002 ...... etc </code></pre>  <p>I am running WHM under centOS</p>  <p>Is possible recover sended mails? Any help would be appreciated.</p>
