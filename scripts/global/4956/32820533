<p>I meet a problem today. I have the VPS with CentOS5.5.</p>  <p>Today I can't FTP file. After check the disk, I find most of the space is lost. The total space is 150GB, but CentOS tells me there's only 121GB and used 2.6GB, what I can't understand is the used is 100%?</p>  <p>Can anyone tell me how to deal with it?</p>  <p>This is my df info of my VPS:</p>  <pre><code>[root@d9 ~]# df -h Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on /dev/simfs            121G  2.6G     0 100% / none                  512M  8.0K  512M   1% /dev </code></pre>
