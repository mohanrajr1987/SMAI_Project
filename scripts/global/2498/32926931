<p>Imagine a scenario where you're changing the bases of DNA to their complement (<code>A</code> -> <code>T</code>, <code>T</code> -> <code>A</code>, etc.)</p>  <p>If I wanted to do this in one line, with just a replace command (whether <code>replaceFirst</code>, <code>replaceAll</code>, etc.), how would I do it or could I without running into a logic trap?</p>  <pre><code>System.out.println(X.replaceFirst("A","T").replaceFirst("G","C").replaceFirst("C","G").replaceFirst("T","A"); </code></pre>  <p>If I were to say AAA as a codon here, it'd come out AAA. Is there a way to code that once a letter has been changed, it can not be changed again by a further command?</p>
