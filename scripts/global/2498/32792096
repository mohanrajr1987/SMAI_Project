<p>In a very large cvs file, I would like to change the 1st and 4th digits in the first column (test format) as follows:</p>  <pre><code>column1; col2; col3; etc. "01230456"; ....; ...; etc. </code></pre>  <p>if the first digit is 0, change it 1, if it is 1 change to 2 (only two possible values) the same applies for the 4th digit within column one.</p>  <p>is there a way to do in the terminal in Mac?</p>
