<p>I had a set-up data.frame like this</p>  <pre><code>c1 &lt;- c(1:5) c2 &lt;- c('A','B','C','D','E') d &lt;- data.frame(c1,c2) d d[,2] = as.character(d[,2]) typeof(d[,2]) mapping &lt;- list(   'A'='Apple',   'B'='Blue Berry' ) d[,2] &lt;- as.character(mapping[d[,2]]) d </code></pre>  <p>From my data.frame, I only want to replace 'A','B', and keep 'C','D', etc, but the result shows NULL for 'C','D',etc. I also tried different methods to give a result I want. However, I want to know why list behaves like that. Is there any way I can use list to have a result I want? Thanks. My result should be like:</p>  <pre><code>  c1         c2    1      Apple    2 Blue Berry    3       'C'    4       'D'    5       'E' </code></pre>  <p>Note: The mapping future using list is from a textbook example from my class.</p>  <p>Edit: Why does the result replace non-match list elements to NULL? </p>
