<p>I have a dictionary with keys and values that represent letters.</p>  <p>for example a simple one :</p>  <pre><code>DICT_CODE = {'b' : 'g', 'n' :'a', 'p' : 'o', 'x' : 'd', 't' : 'y'} </code></pre>  <p>I've received an encrypted code and turned the string into a list, where each item is a word. I need to solve it, according to the items in the dictionary.</p>  <p>an example for a code is :</p>  <pre><code>words_list = ["bppx","xnt!"]  # "good day!" </code></pre>  <p>I've tried to solve it by using double for loops, as here:</p>  <pre><code> for word in words_list:      for char in word:          if char in string.letters:             word = word.replace(char, DICT_CODE.get(char))  print words_list </code></pre>  <p>expected output -> <code>["good","day!"]</code></p>  <p>output -> <code>["bppx","xnt!"]</code></p>  <p>It does not working at all. the charcaters stay the same and the code is stil unknown. I don't understand why it isn't working, if someone has time to look and try to help me and see whats wrong, or even suggest a better way (that works).</p>
