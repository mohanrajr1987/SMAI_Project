Is there any way to convert these to UTF-8 or ASCII formats to English. LIke the above word can be just displayed as pave ?</p>  <p>I did go through as few questions here, but I they suggested removing spaces which is not what I want.</p>  <p>What I have :-</p>  <pre><code>I have a pavé </code></pre>  <p>What I want :-</p>  <pre><code>I have a pave </code></pre>  <p>Any pointers or help is appreciated. I am not looking for a code sample straight away.</p>
