<p>What's the procedure to disable Text Replacement inside a Mac OSX application written in Objective-C?</p>  <p>The application I'm currently debugging is using lots of NSTextFields and<br> from what I've found out NSTextFields doesn't seem to have the same methods as NSTextViews for disabling this:</p>  <ul> <li>setAutomaticQuoteSubstitutionEnabled:NO</li> <li>setAutomaticTextReplacementEnabled:NO</li> </ul>  <p>This is although what I'm trying to achieve for all text fields within the application so what's the procedure in order to get this working? Note that the user shouldn't be able to enable this at any point and it should also override the global settings in System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Text.</p>
