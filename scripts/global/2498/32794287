<p>I have a SQL Server table that is used to populate a website</p>  <p>The website has been attacked, probably using some SQL injection technique and many columns in this table (text columns) have some HTML into it, usually like <code>&lt;div&gt;some stuff and some links&lt;/div&gt;</code>.</p>  <p>I simply want to remove everything after the first <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> using:</p>  <pre><code>UPDATE MyTable SET MyField = REPLACE (MyField,                        SUBSTRING(MyField, CHARINDEX('&lt;', MyField), LEN(MyField)), '') WHERE MyField LIKE '%&lt;%' </code></pre>  <p>It does work great on <code>nvarchar</code> and <code>char</code> columns, but it doesn't work on <code>nvarchar(max)</code> columns. I get this error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Msg 8152, Level 16, State 10, Row 1<br>   String or binary data would be truncated.</p>      <p>Msg 3621, Level 0, State 0, Row 1<br>   The statement has been terminated.</p> </blockquote>  <p>What should I do to remove this stuff from <code>nvarchar(max)</code> columns?</p>
