<p>I'm doing something wrong, that's for sure :-) I checked <a href="https://regex101.com/" rel="nofollow">https://regex101.com/</a> to check if the Regex is correct and couldn't find any problems. Also I'm pretty new to jQuery/JavaScript but the console isn't firing any Syntax errors etc.</p>  <p>I tested the code to replace 'Goedemorgen' to 'Goodmorning'. <strong>that worked fine</strong> so I guess the fault is within the replace/regex? I'm not sure! Any help would be appreciated.</p>  <pre><code>$( document ).ready(function() {      $(".wpcf7-number").focusout(function() {          var InputVal = $('.wpcf7-number').val();         var InputValNew = InputVal.replace(/^[0-9]*$/g,'');          console.log(InputValNew + ' New Var');      });  }); </code></pre>  <p>The output I wish to get: 033-2245-22455 to: 033224522455 (so without the -).</p>  <p><strong>Don't be harsh I'm still learning!</strong></p>
