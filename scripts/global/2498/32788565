<p>I have a rather interesting issue. Content is being build dynamically and creating the following scenario.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;button id="something"&gt;     &lt;i class="fa fa-refresh"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;     Some button text &lt;/button&gt; </code></pre>  <p>What I'm trying to do is replace "some button text" while preserving the Font Awesome tag. I've tried regex and so on, but kind of stuck.</p>  <p>As a note, I've tried .text() and it does replace the text, but also removes the i tag too.</p>
