<p>I have binary files larger than 50 GB, which contain a specific string I want to replace with equal length all-spaces string. The string I am looking for is in the beginning of file, say within the first megabyte. How can I do this with PowerShell?</p>  <p>I am afraid <code>[System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes("myfile.bin")</code> is not the solution, because I don't want to load the whole binary. I want to search and replace within the first megabyte.</p>
