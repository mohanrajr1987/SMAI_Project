<p>I am trying to find regex pattern in a string and replace it using a hash table. First example works fine and I get "$$oldstring$$ $$oldstring$$" as result. I cannot figure out how to pass the '$1' into a hash table as the key in order to replace it with the value corresponding to that key in my hash.</p>  <p>Here is my code:</p>  <pre><code>$hashtable = @{'$$oldstring$$' = 'newstring'}  $testString = '$$oldstring$$'  $replaced = [regex]::Replace($testString, '(\$\$(.*?)\$\$)', '$1 $1') $replaced  $replaced2 = [regex]::Replace($testString, '(\$\$(.*?)\$\$)', $hashtable.Get_Item($1)) $replaced2 </code></pre>  <p>And the output:</p>  <pre><code>$$oldstring$$ $$oldstring$$  Exception calling "get_Item" with "1" argument(s): "Key cannot be null. Parameter name: key" </code></pre>  <p>I understand that $hashtable.Get_Item($1) is not valid syntax and $1 is null here, but can't seem to figure out how to do this properly.</p>
