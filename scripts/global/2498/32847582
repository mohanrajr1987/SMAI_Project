<p>Microsoft Expression Web had a nifty find/replace feature which could find and modify HTML tags according to rules. For example, you could add a new attribute value to all tags with a certain class, insert some text before each <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag in all open files, etc. </p>  <p>I have since moved to Visual Studio 2013 with my web projects, but for some such tasks I occasionally still use this feature in Expression Web. I have looked around for this in Visual Studio and tried to find an extension which can do this, but have found none. </p>  <p>Does someone know of such a feature for Visual Studio?</p>
