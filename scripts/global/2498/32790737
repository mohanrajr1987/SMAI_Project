<p>Please help. Trying to figure out how to replace a string in PowerShell, but don't know the rest of the string. I have this:</p>  <pre><code>(Get-Content $file) -replace[regex]::Escape('file='*''),('file='+$_.BaseName) | Set-Content $file </code></pre>  <p>I don't know what comes after <code>file=</code></p>  <p>I tried my code, but it replaces it multiple times instead of just once.</p>  <p>So trying to replace <code>file=*</code> with <code>filename=$_.BaseName</code>.</p>  <p>Thanks for looking.</p>
