<p>I've created a web application, Now i want to put <code>login authentication</code> using twitter account.</p>  <p>As Stackoverflow include <code>Gmail</code>, <code>Facebook</code> to login into stackoverflow. Similarly i want to make the same thing with my application.</p>  <p>I'm bit confused here, Here is example i found. Please see <a href="http://demos.9lessons.info/twitter-facebook2/login.php" rel="nofollow">this</a>.</p>  <p>I found it into URL bar it generates this:</p>  <pre><code>https://twitter.com/oauth/authenticate?oauth_token=VOU5SAAAAAAAASO2AAABUBx3tgE </code></pre>  <p>But i'm finding difficulties to generate my own's application <code>oauth_token</code>. Can you please help me? How to generate it? I googled and searched into twitter everywhere. But none of things worked for me. :(</p>  <p>Please Help me.. <strong>HELP WOULD BE APPRECIATED!!</strong> </p>
