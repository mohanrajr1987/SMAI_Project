<p>When submitting a tweet ID to GET statuses/lookup, Twitter will return information about the tweet author as well as the tweet.  (<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/statuses/lookup" rel="nofollow">Their documentation gives an example.</a>)  If one requests multiple tweets from the same user, will the information about the user in the returned object reflect the user at the time the tweet was created or the time of the query?  </p>  <p>For example, if John Doe had 100 followers when he wrote Tweet A and 150 when he wrote Tweet B but has 300 when I query him, will submitting the tweet IDs of Tweet A and B return [user][followers_count] = 100, 150 respectively or 300 for each tweet?  When downloading tweets through GET statuses/user_timeline, the returned followers count corresponds to when the query was made, e.g. 300 in this example, not when the tweet was authored (100, 150).</p>
