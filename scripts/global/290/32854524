<p>I'm having an issue where I can get the Twitter API to provide me with the top 10 list of trending topics in a given area, but I can only get the entirety to print, or the first character to print, but not the first entry in the list.</p>  <p>The following code is what I tried to just print the first entry in the list (entry 0) but I get the first character for each list entry instead (character 0).</p>  <pre><code>from twitter import *  access_token = "myaccesstoken" access_token_secret = "myaccesstokensecret" consumer_key = "consumerkey" consumer_secret = "consumersecret"  t = Twitter(auth=OAuth(access_token, access_token_secret, consumer_key, consumer_secret))  results = t.trends.place(_id = 2442047) #I used the Los Angeles WOEID  for location in results:     for trend in location["trends"]:         trendlist = trend["name"]         print trendlist[0] </code></pre>  <p>If I just use a simple list like this, I can get Python to just print the first entry:</p>  <pre><code>trendlist = ['one', 'two', 'three'] print trendlist[0] </code></pre>  <p>Can anyone provide a pointer on why this behavior is different and how to just get one entry to print from the Trending list?</p>  <h1>Thank you!</h1>
