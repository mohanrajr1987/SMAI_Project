<p>When I am authenticating the twitter through handshake It takes me to the authorization page where i authorize the app but its not generating the pin, Its saying may be twitter is slow or connection problem . But I think twitter is good. Can anyone tell me?</p>  <p>Also when I am putting command on twitter it shows an error regarding "carcat.pem" unused argument.</p>
