<p>I have a Mailchimp input form, which I haven't modified (apart from the CSS). In the Twitter in-app browser, when filling in the form, the text appears as expected in the input box. However on clicking submit, a Mailchimp pop-up appears saying that the field was blank.</p>  <p>I'm not sure if this is a bug in Mailchimp or Twitter in-app, but I suspect it's Twitter!</p>  <p>Has anyone else come across this problem, and has tips to fix or debug?</p>
