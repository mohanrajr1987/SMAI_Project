<p>I am building a search engine as a start-up project in Web Development. The search engine takes a string and queries the Wiki and Twitter API.  I have been working on it for days and, I believe, I have found a nice, clean way to implement it.</p>  <p><a href="https://github.com/BoyCook/TwitterJSClient" rel="nofollow">BoyCook's TwitterJSClient</a></p>  <p>In his code (which is beautifully written) he has set up a Twitter function which takes in a config variable and sets up the authorization for us.  Is there something it is missing? I have been through it and it all looks great.  I am new to Javascript and might be missing something..</p>  <p>My code:</p>  <pre><code>var error = function (err, response, body) {     console.log('ERROR [%s]', err); }; var success = function (data) {     console.log('Data [%s]', data); }; var config = {     "consumerKey": "{Mine}",     "consumerSecret": "{Mine}",     "accessToken": "{Mine}",     "accessTokenSecret": "{Mine}",     "callBackUrl": "" }  var Twitter = require('twitter-node-client').Twitter;  var twitter = new Twitter(config);  twitter.getSearch({'q':'Lebron James','count': 10}, error, success); </code></pre>  <p>Can anyone help?  Have you done this before and know an easier way?  Has anyone been able to get it working using postMessage()?</p>  <p>And yes... the origin is using HTTPS protocol. See: <a href="https://jbengine.herokuapp.com" rel="nofollow">JBEngine</a>.  My app permission (on Twitter) is set to read only.</p>  <p>[EDIT] Should probably also mention that I glob'd it all together with browserify and am running the script client-side.</p>
