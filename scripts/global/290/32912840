<p>I've got a Rails app in which I'm building an interface for a user to send a tweet with text, a link, and/or an image. I'm trying to figure out how to handle parsing links into a <code>t.co</code> format and what to do with usernames, but I'm coming up short on any clear explanation of what's required.</p>  <p>I'm using the <code>twitter</code> and <code>omniauth-twitter</code> gems and I've also found the <code>twitter-text</code> gem. What I need to know is, am I required to parse links into a <code>t.co</code> format or do anything to usernames in my app before posting to the API? If so, how can I do that in Ruby/Rails? The documentation for the <code>twitter-text</code> gem, which seems to be the official way to handle this function, is nonexistent. </p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
