<p>I am trying to un retweet a tweet using twitter developer api. For doing that i need the tweet id of my retweet.(as per this answer <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6736153/whats-the-api-to-undo-retweets-unretweet-in-twitter">What&#39;s the API to undo retweets (unretweet) in Twitter?</a>). But how do i get tweet id of my retweet, so that i can un retweet a specific tweet?</p>  <p>One approach is i go through my time line(/user_timeline.json) get every tweet that is retweet, get the original tweet id, compare it with the tweet id in question and get the corresponding retweet id  and then delete that tweet. This seems very inefficient to me.</p>  <p>Is there a better approach. Twitter client allow you to untweet a retweet from home_timeline, i wonder how they do it?</p>
