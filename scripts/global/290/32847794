<p>I would like to get tweets which are belong to same hashtag. I wrote the code below. It works when there is no special character but when there is, it doesn't work. </p>  <pre><code>$query= array(             "q" =&gt; utf8_encode("#InternationalCoffeeDay"),             "result_type" =&gt; "popular"         );  $connection= new TwitterOAuth($apikey,$apisecret,$token,$tokensecret);  $result= $connection-&gt;get('search/tweets',$query);          foreach($result-&gt;statuses as $tweet){              echo $tweet-&gt;text;             echo "&lt;br/&gt;";         } </code></pre>
