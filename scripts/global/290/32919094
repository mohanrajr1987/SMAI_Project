<p>I'm currently trying to make my background image on my homepage to stretch across the whole page, but I'm having difficulties doing this because when I try and re-size the window it becomes smaller?</p>  <p>this is my code:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;             body{                 background: url(img/phantom410.jpg); repeat-y;                 background-size:cover;                 background-color:black;             }         &lt;/style&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Is there a way I can get an image for my website homepage and stretch it across the whole page like what twitter does with their background image; but not have it shrink once it starts getting smaller? thanks!</p>
