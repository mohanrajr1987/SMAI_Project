<p>I have a quick question regarding the rate limits for Twitter Favourites - specifically the GET favorites/list call. I built <strong>favourites.io</strong> to keep track of my favourites. It lets you search and organise your favourites.</p>  <p>Anyway, it works as follows:</p>  <ul> <li>You sign up and authorize the application</li> <li>It imports your favourites (every 15 minutes it makes a call to GET favourites/list and imports any new tweets that you favourited)</li> <li>It uses the user's access token to make the call</li> </ul>  <p>When checking the log file I noticed that one of the import jobs failed for a particular user. The error was: "Rate Limit Exceeded".</p>  <p>My understanding was that an authorized user could make 15 requests in a 15 minute window (and each request could return a maximum of 200 favourited tweets)</p>  <p>My job was running once every 15 minutes, so I'm not sure why that user is getting the "Rate Limited Exceeded" error.</p>  <p>Why might this be happening?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance,</p>  <p>Ross</p>
