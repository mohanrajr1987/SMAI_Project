<p>I'm trying to run this python code, and when I run the code in the command line, there are no errors and the command line goes blank. However, my twitter account isn't connecting to the program. Basically, my program is supposed to find retweets of certain words, and follow the user and retweet the statement.</p>  <p>The program link is here, as it is kinda long.</p>  <p><a href="https://gist.github.com/anonymous/74826364c5384a9254c7" rel="nofollow">https://gist.github.com/anonymous/74826364c5384a9254c7</a>.</p>
