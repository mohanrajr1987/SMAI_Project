<p>When we login to analytics.twitter.com via our account we could see a brief explanation about our followers like interests and occupation etc.</p>  <p>I have a basic portal that users could logIn via their Twitter accounts and I was wondering that, Is it possible to retrieve those data who loggedIn to my portal via using API?</p>  <p>Those data gathered all under audience insight, and I would like to make a meaningful inference about the people who loggedIn to my portal related the quality of their audience and etc.</p>  <p>All in all, I only would like to know is it possible to retrieve those data via using APIs both for Twitter and Youtube?</p>
