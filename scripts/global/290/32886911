<p>Is any member of the community working with Relay ( Stripe) and Twitter for ecommerce ?  We are testing Relay a solution that allows ecommerce transactions backed by Stripe using Twitter as buying platform .Means :u can buy from inside Twitter using Stripe accounts.The basic scheme is nice and works but a deeper look shows:</p>  <ol> <li>No quantity appears in the buy 'form' .So u r limited to q= 1 .This is not usual for an ecommerce solution.</li> <li>No test products can be used ( test means products from the Test Sandbox from Stripe )  ,so u test u pay .We can afford that ,but it is against best practices.</li> <li><p>U cant add an extra param to the order scheme :so if u have some data besides the typical delivery data, you are lost.In our case a customer must add an account number and a given customer can have more than 1 account ( 2 houses,1 cabin,etc ) and order for each of it.</p>  <ul> <li><a href="http://finmove.com" rel="nofollow">http://finmove.com</a></li> <li><a href="http://stripe.com" rel="nofollow">http://stripe.com</a></li> </ul></li> </ol>
