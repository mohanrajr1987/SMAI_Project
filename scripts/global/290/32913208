<p>I have a Rails 4 app on Heroku using the <code>Paperclip</code> gem for storing attachments in S3. I want to be able to use the <code>twitter</code> gem to tweet a Paperclip attachment. I know I can use the <code>update_with_media(text, image)</code> method, however <code>image</code> must be a Ruby <code>File</code> object according to the docs. How can I convert a <code>Paperclip::Attachment</code> object to a <code>File</code> object that can be used with the <code>update_with_media</code> method? Preferably without first saving the file to disk, though that's not a hard requirement as long as I can easily delete the file afterwards?</p>
