<p>Using</p>  <pre><code>&lt;meta name="twitter:app:url:googleplay" content="http://example.com/deep/link"&gt; </code></pre>  <p>in the twitter cards app shows the correct card with an "OPEN THE APP" button however pressing that button opens the twitter in-app browser instead of actually opening the app. When I changed the twitter:app:url:googleplay value to</p>  <pre><code>&lt;meta name="twitter:app:url:googleplay" content="myapp://example.com/deep/link"&gt; </code></pre>  <p>the "OPEN THE APP" button works as expected and open my android app.</p>  <p>Is this really by twitter design or is this a bug? I actually made the same question in twitter community but there is no answer yet. TIA</p>
