<p>For the App I am working on I am using In App Purchases. I am now trying to test it but when I try to purchase something I get the error: </p>  <pre><code>Authentication is required. You need to sign into your Google Account </code></pre>  <p>I already created a signed APK, uploaded it as Alpha to the Play Store. I also added my personal account (not my developer account) as alpha tester and as purchase tester in the Google Play Developer Console. I installed the signed APK on both my personal as my development phones but on both I get the error. </p>  <p>The only thing I haven't done is Publish the Alpha app in the Play Store. This is because our client doesn't have all the data to fill in at the Store Listing section. I have read that it is possible to test IAB without publishing the app.</p>  <p>What am I doing wrong?</p>
