<p>I'm using the google play game services for a multiplayer game. In the app there is a invite button. When the user clicks on this button the built-in player picker UI provided by Google Play games services opens to invite friends or auto pick players (Auto-Match).</p>  <p>For example: I create a game with min. opponents = 1, max. opponents = 4. Then the pick player UI opens (see image). Now I select 3 times auto pick player. Then I click play. Now you see a waiting room. My problem here is, that the room waits for three auto players. It's not starting the game when only 1 random opponents picked.</p>  <p>How can I do that, that the game starts, when only one random opponent comes or start the game with no opponents? Google should add the players later to the game.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/AbuTr.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/AbuTr.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>This is the player selection code:</p>  <pre><code>// launch the player selection screen // minimum: 1 other player; maximum: 3 other players Intent intent = Games.RealTimeMultiplayer.getSelectOpponentsIntent(mGoogleApiClient, 1, 3); startActivityForResult(intent, RC_SELECT_PLAYERS); </code></pre>  <p>Code from: <a href="https://developers.google.com/games/services/android/realtimeMultiplayer" rel="nofollow">Adding Real-time Multiplayer Support...</a></p>
