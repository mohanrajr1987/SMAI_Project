<p>I have submitted several versions of my app to the Google Play and I noticed a bug in the most recent version. However, all previous version still appear and marked <code>Unpublished</code> in the <code>APK</code> section.I am trying to un-publish version <code>2.1</code> and use the version <code>2.0</code>.</p>  <h3>Here are the steps I took:</h3>  <ul> <li>I went to the APK section</li> <li>I switched to the advanced mode</li> <li>Then on version <code>2.0</code> I clicked <code>Move to Prod</code></li> <li>Then on version <code>2.1</code> I clicked <code>Deactivate</code></li> </ul>  <p>I then get this error message : (version 7 is 2.1 and version 6 is 2.0)</p>  <pre><code>This configuration cannot be published for the following reason(s): It is forbidden to downgrade devices which previously matched version 7  to version 6, which would occur when  API levels in range 16+ and  Screen layouts containing any of [small, normal, large, xlarge]  and Features containing all of [android.hardware.screen.PORTRAIT, android.hardware.TOUCHSCREEN].  </code></pre>  <p>When comparing the APK for both versions, the configuration is exactly the same:</p>  <pre><code>------------------------------------------------------- Details     | Version 2.0        | Version 2.1        | ------------------------------------------------------- API levels  | 16+                | 16+                | ------------------------------------------------------- Screen lay. | 4 screen (s/n/l/xl)| 4 screen (s/n/l/xl)| ------------------------------------------------------- Features    | same for both      | same               | ------------------------------------------------------- </code></pre>  <p>so the error message is not very informative in this case. Is this the correct method to go back and activate an older APK version? if yes, what is the problem here?</p>
