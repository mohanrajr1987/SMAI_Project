<p>I'm experiencing something weired and my question goes to if the two could be connected at all and if so: how? </p>  <p>I modeled a php login system after this tutorial:  <a href="http://de.m.wikihow.com/Ein-sicheres-Login-Skript-mit-PHP-und-MySQL-erstellen" rel="nofollow">http://de.m.wikihow.com/Ein-sicheres-Login-Skript-mit-PHP-und-MySQL-erstellen</a> It's in German but the code examples should be straight forward. </p>  <p>Now, it works great. Only whenever I use the site on my android device I get the message "Google play service has been ended" right after I log in on the site.  This doesn't happen with any other action on the site or on the device. But very reliably right after login (not on logout or anywhere). </p>  <p>Is there even the possibility that it could have something to do with the session start? If so, does anyone have some insight?  It doesn't seem to affect the overall functionality of the site but it's weired anyway. </p>  <p>Thanks in advance. </p>
