<p>I recently submitted an Android app to Google Play Store and got a message that my app has rejected. I am not sure what the problem is and couldn't find an exact solution.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>REASON FOR REJECTION:Violation of the Prohibited Actions provision of   the Content Policy.</p>      <p>After a regular review, we have determined that your app enables   background playing of YouTube videos, which is a violation of the   YouTube API Terms of Service:</p>      <p>"Your API Client will not, and You will not encourage or create   functionality for Your users or other third parties to: (8) separate,   isolate, or modify the audio or video components of any YouTube   audiovisual content made available through the YouTube API;"</p>      <p>All submission rejections are tracked. Repeated rejections due to   policy violations will result in app suspension, at which point this   app will count as a strike against the good standing of your developer   account and no longer be available on Google Play.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Actually,the app logic is very simple. The app has the only one WebView and it just loads a url with embedded youtube videos. </p>  <p>Here is a link that the webview shows. <a href="http://www.x17online.com/2015/08/benji_madden_cameron_diaz_are_at_lax_photos_083115#kWESwFbZwGicf9PV.99" rel="nofollow">http://www.x17online.com/2015/08/benji_madden_cameron_diaz_are_at_lax_photos_083115#kWESwFbZwGicf9PV.99</a></p>  <p>So I guess there is a problem when playing this youtube videos, so I tried to use several methods to solve it but it isn't fixed.</p>  <p>Please help me out!!! Thanks</p>
