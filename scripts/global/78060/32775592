<p>Got warning from google play.</p>  <p>How can i handle "SSL Error Handler Vulnerability" of unsafe implementation of the WebViewClient.onReceivedSslError handler.</p>  <p>"Please address this vulnerability as soon as possible and increment the version number of the upgraded APK. To properly handle SSL certificate validation, change your code to invoke SslErrorHandler.proceed() whenever the certificate presented by the server meets your expectations, and invoke SslErrorHandler.cancel() otherwise."</p>
