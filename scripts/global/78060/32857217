<p>I have an beta version of an app in Google Play.  I've gotten beta testing to work (via a list of email addresses) but when my beta testers opt in, they are forced to return to the app store every time to open the app.  It will not allow them to place an icon on their home screen.  Is this standard for apps in the beta testing stage?  If not, any idea how I can fix it so they can open the app from their apps list like all other apps rather than returning to the play store each and every time?  Thanks!  </p>  <p>This posted is related to, but the same as the following post (the following post refers to apps in production, my question is specifically about apps in beta and is not answered by this post) <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17951352/android-app-not-creating-shortcut-icon-on-home-screen-downloaded-from-play-stor">Android app not creating shortcut icon on home screen (downloaded from play store)</a></p>
