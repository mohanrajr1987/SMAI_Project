<p>I use the gsutil Google tool to get the sales reports of my app: <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6135870#export" rel="nofollow">https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6135870#export</a></p>  <p>I have a free trial (one week) for an one month subscription.</p>  <p>To track transactions relating to a given subscription, Google payments provides a base Merchant Order Number for all recurrences of the subscription and denotes each recurring transaction by appending an integer as follows: </p>  <p>GPA.1234-5678-9012-34567 (base order number)</p>  <p>GPA.1234-5678-9012-34567..0 (first recurrence orderID)</p>  <p>GPA.1234-5678-9012-34567..1 (second recurrence orderID)</p>  <p>GPA.1234-5678-9012-34567..2 (third recurrence orderID)</p>  <p>If I call gsutil : </p>  <pre><code>gsutil cp -r gs://pubsite_prod_rev_XXXXXXXXXXXX/sales/salesreport_201509* /Users/XXXX/Desktop </code></pre>  <p>As I have a free trial, gsutil doesn't display the base order number, it always starts with the first recurrence. I suppose it's because the base order corresponds to the free trial (user hasn't charged).</p>  <p>It's a problem for me, because I really need to know when user is subscribed, even if the user hasn't paid yet.</p>  <p>How can I do?</p>
