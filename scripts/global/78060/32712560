<p>I am developing a mobile game for Android using Unity 3D. I'm using Soomla package as the in-app billing module.</p>  <p>Now, I only have one item to sell. The initial price for that item was X, and I have changed it to Y (days ago) in the google play developer console inside the in-app products sector. But, the price still showing as X inside the app in the google play purchase window when trying to purchase it. The Soomla code also contains the Y price-</p>  <pre><code> public static VirtualGood NO_ADS_LTVG = new LifetimeVG(         "No Ads",                                                       // name         "No More Ads!",                                                 // description         "no_ads",                                                       // item id         new PurchaseWithMarket(NO_ADS_LIFETIME_PRODUCT_ID, &lt;Y price&gt;));     // the way this virtual good is purchased </code></pre>  <p>The app is in production, the in-app item in the google play console is active, the apk was built as release mode, Soomla code of purchasing and viewing the balance is good, but the price is still X.</p>  <p>Any idea?</p>  <p>By the way, does any one know what's the purpose of the pricing in the <code>PurchaseWithMarket</code> object? as far as I understand the price is defined by the in-app item inside the google developer console, and no further information about that is availble in the Soomla documentation.</p>
