<p>I'm from Egypt and I'm Learning Android Developing, I've already made 2 apps but not yet published, that's why I made the Play developer console and got a domain name with web hosting for it as a front for my apps and presentation for it, I wanted to put some free and some paid apps or apps with ads, the problem is that if i put paid or ads then i must <strong>make a merchant account with my business name and address on it which will be made public</strong>, and I don't have any of that, I'm a freelancer, what should I do? Please help</p>
