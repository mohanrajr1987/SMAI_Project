<p>I am having an android app already published in Google play store , now I want to <strong>update</strong> its description and screenshot only.</p>  <p>Can I update it and save it as draft <strong><em>before publishing</em></strong> it in the play store (like <strong>iTunesConnect</strong> for apple).</p>  <p>When I edit its content its showing like this,</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/cZhaW.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/cZhaW.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>If I click this <strong>Submit</strong> button will it save as a draft or directly published in the play store.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
