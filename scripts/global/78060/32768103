<p>Suppose I have an Android app that contains more than one launchable Activity (so marked with the LAUNCHER category. If a user downloads my app from the Play Store, they will of course see an Open button in the Play Store UI on my app's product page. I have noticed that tapping on this Open button consistently selects one of my launchable Activities, but I wonder how does it choose which of my Activities to launch?</p>  <p>My guess is that it chooses the topmost one listed in the compiled manifest binary. I could test this with trial-and-error but it would take a while as there is an ingestion delay when publishing an app to the Play Store.</p>
