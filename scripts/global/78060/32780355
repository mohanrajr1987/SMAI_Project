<p>I have three app's in google play and the app' store, all of which are related in one way or another and all of which had cross-referenced keywords. I now want to make one of the app's my primary app and in essence de-optimise the other two so that they do not appear in the search results. So far I have..</p>  <p>Changed the key words so that they are not related Changed the app names so that they are not related Changed the category so that they are not related</p>  <p>Having saved the changes and published them to the app stores/google play I'm still getting the other two app's listed alongside the one that should be returned on its own when I do a search on a key word specific to that app.</p>  <p>What am I doing wrong?</p>
