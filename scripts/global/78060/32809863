<p>I am working on a project that has a web as well as a mobile application. The purpose is to build a platform that would let a number of companies push content into a single app (the one I am building), and then in this android app the end user can interact with the content and if needed, can open the company's app directly.    </p>  <p>For this I need other companies to register their android apps. In order to let them do so, I am asking them for the play store URL, which I would then parse to get the package name from it. </p>  <p>All of this info, company details along with the package names of their android apps, would then be pushed into my mobile app. This would enable the user to directly open the companies app from within my app.</p>  <p>The challenge that I am facing right now is how to stop fraud/fake registrations? </p>  <p>How do I verify that the android app, for which the URL has been provided, belongs to the company that is under registration. I do not want any one to walk in and get someone else's app registered as his own.</p>  <p>I thought that Google might have had some search API for the play store but no there's none. Any suggestions?       </p>
