<p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>  <p>So, what I need is that I want to have different download links for my android app which will ultimately redirect to playstore. And for my app; downloaded from each different link I want some different functionality on the basis of a parameter passed from the link. </p>  <p><em>What can be done?</em></p>  <p>I have heard about DeepLinking. I want to know whether it is even possible to achieve what I am thinking? If yes then how?</p>
