<p>When I linked my android app to the game center it asked for the SHA1 key. I gave it the android debug key. My release key obviously has a different SHA1. The problem is that I already published the game. The app is only published on Alpha release. Anyway do I have to relink the app to game center with the release version of the SHa1, or is the developer console smart enough to sort it out? </p>
