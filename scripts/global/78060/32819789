<p>Seen several S/O links which failed to fix this for me.</p>  <p>Have been developing an Anrdoid App with some use of Google Maps API. Cannot test said code because it claims:</p>  <p>"Google Play services out of date.  Requires 7895000 but found 6774470"</p>  <p>Instead of showing the map, you get a message plus an "Update" button, which crashes the APP if you click on it. (I believe it's dependent upon Google Play Store being installed)</p>  <p>There is no Google Play store installed on the emulator - this appears to be by design from Google, neither does there appear a way to install it.</p>  <p>The Google Play Services cannot be updated through the settings panel</p>  <p>I have tried downloading the appropriate APK and using adb install, but despite choosing the correct download (current version 6.7.74 1723905-470, downloaded apk 7.8.99 2134222-470) it says: Failure [INSTALL_FAILED_UPDATE_INCOMPATIBLE]</p>  <p>I have tried creating a new x86 emulator with a different Android version, same problems persist. Current preference is Google APIs v22 on x86.</p>  <p>How can you test Google Maps on an emulator without paying Google money?</p>
