<p>I'm attempting to concatenate two fields into one, the first one is a varchar and the second is an int. I'm getting a "conversion failed when converting the data type varchar to data type int" error, and I'm not familiar enough with sql to troubleshoot on my own why this is happening.</p>  <p>The code is as follows:</p>  <p>concat(polpolicynumber, '-', convert(varchar(10),poltermsequence)) as RefValue</p>  <p>I'm also not sure why it's attempting to convert it to an int. Keeping it as a varchar is what I want.</p>  <p>Any help would be most appreciated. </p>  <p>Thanks so much!</p>  <p>Here's the entire code in case that helps:</p>  <pre><code>declare @rundate date = '10-02-2015' select @rundate as RunDate, 'FINYS' as Source, 'Agency' as ReferenceTable, 'AgcID' as RefID, agcid as RefValue,  agcname as LastName, '' as MiddleName, '' as FirstName from COHPROD_Policy..agency where AgcExpirationDate is NULL or agcexpirationdate &gt; @rundate union select @rundate as RunDate, 'FINYS' as Source, 'Agent' as ReferenceTable, 'AgtID' as RefID, agtid as RefValue,  agtname as LastName, '' as MiddleName, '' as FirstName from COHPROD_Policy..agent where AgtTerminationDate is NULL or AgtTerminationDate &gt; @rundate union select @rundate as RunDate, 'FINYS' as Source, 'Policy' as ReferenceTable, 'PolNumber' as RefID,  concat(polpolicynumber, ' ', 'Term', ' ', convert(nvarchar(10),poltermsequence)) as RefValue,  isnull(connamelast,'') as LastName, isnull(connamemiddle,'') as MiddleName, isnull(connamefirst,'') as FirstName from COHPROD_Policy..policy p join COHPROD_Policy..ContactXref cox on coxpolid = polid join COHPROD_Policy..Contact con on conid = coxconid join cohprod_policy..policystatus on pospolid = polid where pospolicystatus = 'active' </code></pre>
