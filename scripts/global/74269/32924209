<p>My DB is an SQL Server 2012. I try to select only the year from my datetime filed. The date format is dd/mm/yyyy 00:00:00. Here is my queries:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT         ,YEAR(DateTime) FROM MayTable </code></pre>  <p>But when I run my queries I get this error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Conversion failed when converting date and/or time from character   string.</p> </blockquote>
