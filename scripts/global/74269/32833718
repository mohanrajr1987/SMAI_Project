<p>I have two databases DB1 and DB2 DB1 has a source table named 'Source' I have created a login 'Test_user' in DB2 with Public access. I have also created a view named 'Test_view' in DB2 which references data from DB1.dbo.Source</p>  <p>How can I do the following: AS A Test_user</p>  <blockquote>   <p>SELECT * FROM DB2.dbo.Test_view --Should work</p>      <p>SELECT * FROM DB1.dbo.Source --Should Not work</p> </blockquote>
