<p>How can I modify the following query to Identify possible implicit conversions (for columns that share the same name) across databases? </p>  <p>What I currently have works, but only for whatever database you are currently in. </p>  <p>What I would like is to see all the potential matches for each database on the same server. Here is what I'm currently working with:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT DISTINCT         @@SERVERNAME AS [server_name] ,         DB_NAME() AS [database_name] ,         [left].[COLUMN_NAME] AS [column_name] ,         [left].[TABLE_SCHEMA] AS [table_schema] ,         [left].[TABLE_NAME] AS [table_name] ,         [left].[DATA_TYPE] AS [data_type] ,         [left].[CHARACTER_MAXIMUM_LENGTH] AS [character_maximum_length] ,         [left].[NUMERIC_PRECISION] AS [numeric_precision] ,         [left].[NUMERIC_SCALE] AS [numeric_scale] FROM    [INFORMATION_SCHEMA].[COLUMNS] [left]         INNER JOIN [INFORMATION_SCHEMA].[COLUMNS] [right] ON [left].[COLUMN_NAME] = [right].[COLUMN_NAME] WHERE   ( ( [left].[DATA_TYPE] != [right].[DATA_TYPE] )           OR ( [left].[CHARACTER_MAXIMUM_LENGTH] != [right].[CHARACTER_MAXIMUM_LENGTH] )           OR ( [left].[NUMERIC_PRECISION] != [right].[NUMERIC_PRECISION] )           OR ( [left].[NUMERIC_SCALE] != [right].[NUMERIC_SCALE] )         ) ORDER BY [left].[COLUMN_NAME] ,         [left].[TABLE_SCHEMA] ,         [left].[TABLE_NAME]                          </code></pre>
