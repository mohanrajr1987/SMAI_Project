<p>I have CDC InstanceA created with 2 Columns (col1, col2) and have 1 million of data. If I want to have few more columns included (lets say Col3, Col4), then I have to create a new instance (InstanceB) because we cannot have the columns included in the already created InstanceA as per CDC design. Hence, I will be creating a InstanceB with all new columns mentioned. Then, CDC will start capturing the transactions and then I can move the old data from the instanceA to instanceB.</p>  <p>Now, I have an important requirement.</p>  <p><strong><em>I want to stop all the transactions getting captured only on instanceA till I complete moving the records from Instance A to Instance B.</em></strong></p>  <p>Please suggest.</p>  <p>With many Thanks in advance.</p>
