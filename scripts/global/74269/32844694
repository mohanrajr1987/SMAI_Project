<p>This works good, as I expected:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT * FROM Openquery(RETAIL_PROD_UK, 'select LOAN_STATUS FROM lloanall') </code></pre>  <p>But why can't I do this? Is it not possible to use joins in openquerys?</p>  <pre><code>SELECT * FROM Openquery(RETAIL_PROD_UK, 'select LOAN_STATUS FROM lloanall As l') </code></pre>  <blockquote>   <p>Msg 7321, Level 16, State 2, Line 1 An error occurred while preparing   the query "select LOAN_STATUS FROM lloanall as l" for execution   against OLE DB provider "MSDASQL" for linked server "RETAIL_PROD_UK".</p> </blockquote>
