<p>I have used SQL Merge for CRUD operations in a table that holds records more than 3 million and due to merge locks the table this would gives time out errors on other selects and updates in the production environment.</p>  <p>Site has been accessed by multiple users at a given time and same table could be updated by different set of users at the same time.</p>  <p>so based on my scenario is using SQL merge is efficient or do i have to use INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE statements?</p>  <p>is there are any way that improve merge by only locking the data record instead of locking the entire table?</p>
