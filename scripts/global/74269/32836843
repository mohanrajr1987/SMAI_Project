<p>I am having a table view named <code>Symbols_Master</code></p>  <p>I am trying to get data from this view using C#. Here is my code:</p>  <pre><code>SqlConnection connMits = new SqlConnection("test\\dev05;Initial Catalog=xyz;Integrated Security=True");  SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand(); command.CommandType = CommandType.Text; command.CommandText = "select top 2000 Name from Symbols_Master where TypeID=10 and Active=1"; command.Connection = connMits;  //Option 1:  SqlDataAdapter myAdapter = new SqlDataAdapter(); myAdapter.SelectCommand = command;  DataSet myDataSet = new DataSet(); myAdapter.Fill(myDataSet);  //Option 2:    DataTable table = new DataTable(); table.Load(command.ExecuteReader());  //Option 3: SqlDataReader reader = command.ExecuteReader(); </code></pre>  <p>I have tried 3 different ways for executing this query as wriiten above, but none of these are working. I always get a crash <code>Additional information: Invalid object name 'Symbols_Master'.</code></p>  <p>Am I doing something wrong here or is there any other approach I should follow to read a view?</p>
