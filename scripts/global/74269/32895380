<p>Hi all consider following as my table structure  </p>  <pre><code>Col1   Col2 Col3  A       1    Aa A       2    Bb A       1    Aa A       4    Bb B       2    Bb C       1    Aa C       5    Bb D       3    Aa </code></pre>  <p>As you can see Col3 contains distint values of Aa and Bb.</p>  <p>I am trying to write a query which return only rows with Col1 having value Aa and Bb (Both) or Aa(Alone). </p>  <p>Point is to remove those rows which have only have Bb associated with distinct Col1 value to it.</p>  <p>Example - For Col1 Distinct value of A should have Aa and Bb / Aa in corresponding Col3. This requirement is violated by value of B in Col1, hence result set should not have rows associated with B.</p>  <p>Expected output -</p>  <pre><code>Col1   Col2 Col3  A       1    Aa A       2    Bb A       1    Aa A       4    Bb C       1    Aa C       5    Bb D       3    Aa </code></pre>
