<p>I'm having some very strange behavior with coalesce. When I don't specify a return amount (TOP (50)) I'm only getting a single last result, but if I remove the "Order By" it works... Examples below</p>  <pre><code>DECLARE @result varchar(MAX) SELECT @result = COALESCE(@result + ',', '') + [Title] FROM Episodes WHERE [SeriesID] = '1480684' AND [Season] = '1' Order by [Episode] ASC SELECT @result </code></pre>  <p>Will only return a single last result:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The Shiva Bowl</p> </blockquote>  <p>But If I specifiy a max return amount (only adding <strong>TOP (50)</strong> to same statement)</p>  <pre><code>DECLARE @result varchar(MAX) SELECT TOP(50) @result = COALESCE(@result + ',', '') + [Title] FROM Episodes WHERE [SeriesID] = '1480684' AND [Season] = '1' Order by [Episode] ASC SELECT @result </code></pre>  <p>I get all the results in proper order</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The Draft,The Bounce Test,Sunday at Ruxin's,Mr. McGibblets,The Usual Bet,The Shiva Bowl</p> </blockquote>  <p>The culprit seems to be the [Title] column as if I return a different column it seems to be working without specifying a return limit. FYI [Title] is a VARCHAR(MAX) NOT NULL column.</p>  <p>Any insight what could be causing this? I really don't want to set a limit, but it's the only way it's returning all the data at the moment... Thanks</p>
