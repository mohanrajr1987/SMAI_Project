<p>I'm importing data from Sybase to sql server 2012 . I created a windows application to do this. Problem is that when i import the data from Sybase to Sql server 2008 R2 its work perfect in this case the Sybase and Sql server database are in same computer. But when i try to import the data from local to another computer this is not working.The Exception  <code>Cannot initialize the data source object of OLE DB provider "MSDASQL" for linked server "LINKServer". OLE DB provider "MSDASQL" for linked server "LINKServer" returned message "[Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager] Data source name not found and no default driver specified".</code>.</p>
