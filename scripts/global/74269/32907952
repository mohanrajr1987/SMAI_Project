<p>not 100% sure on how to title this, but here's my question</p>  <p>say I want to find multiple words in a string, for example: <code>"AHU Replacement"</code></p>  <p>now the user could have stored this in the database as </p>  <pre><code>"Replacement of AHU" "Replacement of the AHU" "The AHU needs Replacing" </code></pre>  <p>and most likely in many more ways, so how could I write a query that could scan through a table and detect all of these based on this search string as an example <code>"AHU Replacement"</code> which would be stored in a table itself as key searches</p>  <p>this code could find the 1st two strings above, however the variation of "<code>Replacing</code>" and "<code>Replacement</code>" is an issue:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT * FROM ProjectNotes where Notes like '%AHU%' and Notes like '%replacement%' </code></pre>
