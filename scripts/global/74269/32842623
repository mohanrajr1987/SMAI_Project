<p><strong>Dear all,</strong> Currently I am just researching how I could handle the change of the collation on the database. </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Somebody made an unusual decision to create accent sensitive database for global use... but I am on the way to handle this!</p> </blockquote>  <p>REASON: of changing the collation is that database contains data collected from different countries and as we all know some of cultures have their own letters. </p>  <p>With the respect for the customers, our organization would like to have Accent Insensitive database. That will allow users to request data from the server without any limitations using local characters.</p>  <p>As far as I have find out, there may be an option to drop constraints and etc. change collation and then just to bring everything back. In this case I am afraid if this would be enough to affect already existing data (columns).</p>  <p>Another way, I have found an article in <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/302405/The-Easy-way-of-changing-Collation-of-all-Database" rel="nofollow">Collation change on 2005 and 2008 server</a>. However, this does not include the 2012 server.</p>  <p>Also I am taking the complexity of this example into consideration as well.</p>  <p>I believe that I am not in an easy phase. But I am hoping to get few advises what would be the best and safest way to handle this.</p>  <p>Thank you for your concerns and assistance.</p>
