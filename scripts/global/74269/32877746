<p>Which of the following is a better performing query? </p>  <pre><code>--query a Select * UserDefXml.query('/Product/ProductName/text()') From ProductsDB.dbo.ProductsTable  --query b Select *  UserDefXml.value('(/Product/ProductName)[1]','varchar(max)') From ProductsDB.dbo.ProductsTable </code></pre>  <p>What are the recommended scenarios for each of these? Are there any other ways to accomplish this? </p>  <p>Thank you. </p>
