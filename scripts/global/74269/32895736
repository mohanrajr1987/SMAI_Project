<p>I am running queries on an alarm system signal automation platform database in SQL Server 2012 Management Studio, and I am running into some hiccups. </p>  <p>My queries run just fine, but I am unable to refine my results to the level that I would like.</p>  <p>I am selecting some columns that are formatted as <code>DATETIME</code>, and I simply want to take the value in the column and subtract 4 hours from it (i.e., from GMT to EST) and then output <em>that</em> value into the query results. </p>  <p>All of the documentation I can find regarding <code>DATESUB()</code> or similar commands are showing examples with a specific <code>DATETIME</code> in the syntax, and I don't have anything specific, just 138,000 rows with columns I want to adjust time zones for. </p>  <p>Am I missing something big or will I just need to continue to adjust manually after I being manipulating my query result? Also, in case it makes a difference, I have a read-only access level, and am not interested in altering table data in any way. </p>
