<p>My stored procedure has 3 parameters i'm passing <code>(@nameP, @idP, @dateP</code>) and is inserting the data in a  <code>#myTemp</code> table</p>  <p>then i use </p>  <pre><code> select *      into dbo.realTable     from #myTemp </code></pre>  <p>and then I want to filter out any data which already exists (in <code>dbo.FinalTable</code>)based on <code>dateP</code> and <code>idP</code>:</p>  <pre><code>insert into dbo.FinalTable  select * from dbo.realTable where not exists (select * from dbo.FinalTable where idP = @idP and dateP = @dateP)  drop table dbo.realTable </code></pre>  <p>The data is appended to the table, when i execute my procedure. The problem is that if i put the same <code>idP</code> and execute it again for the same <code>dateP</code>, it shouldn't insert anything but it does. I think the problem might be in the <code>insert into</code> part.</p>  <h2>EDIT:</h2>  <p>this works perfectly if i remove <code>and dateP = @dateP</code> from the where clause) ps: thank you all for your answers, even if in my case i simply had to do what i wrote above, I learned from your answers</p>
