<p>I'm working on the storage optimazation system, where I have 3 storage boxes of different sizes, any combination of these goes into a storage space of a fixed size, and thus I need to find the best combination to use the least amount of storage space, so more can easily be added later.</p>  <p>Example</p>  <pre><code>4x 35cm3 3x 50cm3 3x 75cm3 </code></pre>  <p>Total space needed: 515 cm3</p>  <p>Each storage space is 400 cm3</p>
