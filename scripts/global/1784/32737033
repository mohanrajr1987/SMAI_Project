<p>I have the HTML page around 15 thousands lines of code and printing it  on pdf using the pdf generation tool <strong><a href="http://wkhtmltopdf.org/" rel="nofollow">WKHTMLTOPDF</a></strong>. On PDF page it  goes around 103 pages but some of the content from lowest section of  HTML code removes automatically in PDF while in HTML it is rendering  properly.</p>  <p>When I search around for the issue than i found that the WKHTMLTOPDF  use <code>--enable-default-shrinking (default)</code> and when i use the  <code>--disable-default-shrinking</code> than it show the content which was  removing.</p>  <p>But it produce the new problem for me that the content from LEFT size  is removing partially. I have tried using <code>--dpi 96</code> but it some how  fix the content on pdf but still the issue with removing the content  from right.</p>  <p>What could be the solution ? Should i use <code>--disable-default-shrinking</code>  and <code>--dpi 96</code> but this also not works perfectly for me.</p>  <p>Here is my tools details :  <strong>Operating system</strong> : Ubuntu 12.04<br>  <strong>WKHTMLTOPDF Version</strong> : 0.12.1 (with patched qt)</p>
