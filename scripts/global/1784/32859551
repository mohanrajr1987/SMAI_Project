<p>I have tried everything from jsPDF + html2canvas, jsPDF + rasterize, mPDF (a PHP library), HTML2PDF (PHP Library) and they all turn out either very blurry images and text or (in the case of mPDF and HTML2PDF, are very poor at positioning elements). The quality is very poor.</p>  <p>I need a way to create it either client side or server side (in PHP) but I don't have the ability to install executables on the server. Are there any options?</p>  <p>This code turns out very poor quality:</p>  <pre><code>html2canvas(document.body, {   onrendered: function(canvas) {     document.body.appendChild(canvas);   } }); </code></pre>
