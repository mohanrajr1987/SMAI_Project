<p>Is there any way to write a PDF in iText with syntax highlighting?</p>  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_highlighting" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_highlighting</a></p>  <p>Any Plugins, libs etc.? I would like to add syntax highlighting to my .java, .xml, .php files when I am writing them into a PDF(a single PDF, by the way).</p>  <p>EDIT: The project which I am writing(that generates the PDF) is written in java, so I need java-compatible libraries</p>
