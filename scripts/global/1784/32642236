<p>I'm using <code>\newpage</code> to force my figures to be in the right spot. I have added <code>\newpage</code> after the figure chunk. However, the figure caption is ignored when rendering the PDF.</p>  <p>I have tried <code>fig.pos</code> to force my figures, but it didn't work. I've also tried <code>\clearpage</code> and <code>\pagebreak</code>. None of them seem to work. Any idea what I'm doing wrong, or what I need to add to make it work?</p>  <p>Here's an example:</p>  <pre><code>```{r eg, fig.width=4, fig.height=6, echo=FALSE, fig.pos="!H", fig.cap="\\label{fig:eg}Plot example", dev='png'}   plot(c(1:20))  ```  \newpage  some text some text   some other figure (with proper caption)  some text </code></pre>  <p>In the PDF version after using the figure label, I only see Figure?? as the caption.</p>
