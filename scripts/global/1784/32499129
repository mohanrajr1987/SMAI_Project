<p>In PDFBOX, I want to insert some images as form fields which can be stored in an acroform. Later for some value changes in specific PDTextBox field by user, I want to invoke Javascript function to show/hide above image fields. Also confirm whether there is a support in javascript to make image field hide/show (i.e., If I am able to give name to such image filed then i think it is possible).</p>  <p>Is there functionality available in PDFBOX 1.8.10 to achieve this goal? If yes, please provide reference code/document.</p>  <p>Thanks for help in advanced.</p>
