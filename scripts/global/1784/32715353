<p>Here is my question presented in a below picture. The issue is that the first type of PDF documents with Cyrillic letters in ANSI (MS Windows) encoding can be viewed/printed properly when loaded from a web stream into a C1 (ComponentOne) Silverlight 5 PDF viewer control, and the second type of PDF documents gets Cyrillic letters presented improperly.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/P14Vy.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/P14Vy.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
