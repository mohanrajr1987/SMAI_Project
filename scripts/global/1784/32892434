<p>Libharu seems to be a great way to create pdfs on multiple platforms but I am not able to compile it on all platforms. Is there a place where binary versions can be downloaded?</p>  <p>I am searching for a way to have pdf creation ability in a Firemonkey (Delphi 10 Seattle) appliaction I am currently developing. Delphi bindings are provided by libharu. But perhaps there is an alternative out there in native pascal that compiles in Delphi?</p>
