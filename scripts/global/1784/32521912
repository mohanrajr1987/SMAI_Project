<p>I was trying to create a pdf dynamically and send it by attaching in the mail. This is my code and it works perfectly for me.</p>  <pre><code>   public ActionResult sendmail()     {         MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream();         Document doc = new Document(PageSize.A4, 10f, 10f, 100f, 0.0f);         PdfWriter writer = PdfWriter.GetInstance(doc, ms);         doc.Open(); //open doc for editing         doc.Add(new Paragraph("First Paragraph"));         doc.Add(new Paragraph("Second Paragraph"));         writer.CloseStream = false; //important         doc.Close(); //build the doc.          ms.Position = 0;          SmtpClient smtpClient = new SmtpClient();         smtpClient.Host = "provider.com";         smtpClient.Credentials = new NetworkCredential("credentialmailid", "password");           MailMessage mailMessage = new MailMessage()         {             From = new MailAddress("from@gmail.com")         };         mailMessage.To.Add(new MailAddress("to@gmail.com"));         mailMessage.Subject = "Pdf attached";                     mailMessage.Attachments.Add(new Attachment(ms, "pdfname.pdf"));         smtpClient.Send(mailMessage);         return RedirectToAction("index");     } </code></pre>  <p>Now my issue is : Document that I have to send is a purchase confirmation . it will have 3 pages. Many headings and styles will be there in it.</p>  <p>also some values I have to pass dynamically like who purchased it and date like wise a lot datas should pass dynamically</p>  <p>How to do this? I thought to create an Html of pdf file to be send and use something like this add parameters dynamically...</p>  <pre><code>        string mailpath = Server.MapPath("~/Mail/HtmlOF_pdfToSend.html");         string mailbody = System.IO.File.ReadAllText(mailpath);         mailbody = mailbody.Replace("##CompanyName", "Bhavin Merchant");         mailbody = mailbody.Replace("##BusinessType", "Bhavin business"); </code></pre>
