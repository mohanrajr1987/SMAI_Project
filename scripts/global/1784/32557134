<p>I am trying to extract or download the PDF which is currently being displayed in the browser using the PDF.js viewer.  Here is an example of the URL which displays the PDF:     <a href="http://www.reports.targetsite.ca/pdfjs/web/viewer.html?file=%2FReport%2F%3FSessionID%3D62294da9-9e7f-4d12-8d64-ebc684083a66%26ReportID%3D246214%2C%26InvoiceID%3D430019%26InvoiceItemID%3D470627%26Type%3DBasic%20Report%26Agent%3D2%26NoImg%3Dfalse%26AddMap%3Dtrue" rel="nofollow">http://www.reports.targetsite.ca/pdfjs/web/viewer.html?file=%2FReport%2F%3FSessionID%3D62294da9-9e7f-4d12-8d64-ebc684083a66%26ReportID%3D246214%2C%26InvoiceID%3D430019%26InvoiceItemID%3D470627%26Type%3DBasic%20Report%26Agent%3D2%26NoImg%3Dfalse%26AddMap%3Dtrue</a></p>  <p><em>(Unfortunately the above is not a live link.  I cannot provide a live link because the links are within a password-protected site, and are time-limited.)</em></p>  <p>Is there any way to automate the downloading of the PDF file and specify the filename and path, without having to press the download button each time and wait for the <code>Save As</code> dialog box to appear?  I am wondering whether something like this can be done with javascript.</p>
