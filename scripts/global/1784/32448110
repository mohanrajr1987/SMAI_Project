<p>I'm looking at creating a form in my website by which I can enable my users to fill in certain information in the various text boxes of the form. Also I would like to have a file upload option so that the users can attach documents to it. I would like these documents to be converted to PDF format online itself and then create a new folder on my server in a specified destination where each users file will be saved in a new folder. The folder name must be the users id number which will be collected in the form. Also the form data which is submitted can also be created in the same folder as a text file or CSV. Please help me on how do I achieve this. Also could you let me know if this kind of function can work on a WordPress site as well? </p>  <p>As of yet i managed to get the following code to create a form &amp; also have a file uploaded.</p>  <p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false"> <div class="snippet-code"> <pre class="snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override"><code>&lt;form action="./upload.php" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data"&gt; Name: &lt;input type="text" name="name"&gt;&lt;br&gt; E-mail: &lt;input type="text" name="email"&gt;&lt;br&gt; User ID: &lt;input type="text" name="uid"&gt;&lt;br&gt; Phone number: &lt;input type="number" name="phno"&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;label for="file"&gt;Select a file:&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input type="file" name="userfile" id="file"&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;button&gt;Upload File&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/form&gt;	      &lt;?php    // Configuration - Your Options   $allowed_filetypes = array('.doc','.docx','.pdf'); // These will be the types of file that will pass the validation.   $max_filesize = 524288; // Maximum filesize in BYTES (currently 0.5MB).   $upload_path = './testupload/'; // The place the files will be uploaded to (currently a 'files' directory).      $filename = $_FILES['userfile']['name']; // Get the name of the file (including file extension).    $ext = substr($filename, strpos($filename,'.'), strlen($filename)-1); // Get the extension from the filename.      // Check if the filetype is allowed, if not DIE and inform the user.    if(!in_array($ext,$allowed_filetypes))   die('The file you attempted to upload is not allowed.');      // Now check the filesize, if it is too large then DIE and inform the user.    if(filesize($_FILES['userfile']['tmp_name']) &gt; $max_filesize)   die('The file you attempted to upload is too large.');      // Check if we can upload to the specified path, if not DIE and inform the user.    if(!is_writable($upload_path))   die('You cannot upload to the specified directory, please CHMOD it to 777.');      // Upload the file to your specified path.    if(move_uploaded_file($_FILES['userfile']['tmp_name'],$upload_path . $filename))      echo 'Your file upload was successful, view the file &lt;a href="' . $upload_path . $filename . '" title="Your File"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;'; // It worked.   else      echo 'There was an error during the file upload.  Please try again.'; // It failed :(.   ?&gt;</code></pre> </div> </div> </p>  <p>In the above code, when a user uploads a file, i would like it to get converted to pdf create a new directory in the path based on the UserID entered in the form. Please help me ahead of this.</p>
