<p>So I have a program where you need to call a get method to get two items in an object. I thought, what if I could just have it so if the user passes in nothing with the arguement...</p>  <pre><code>x.getItem(); </code></pre>  <p>It would work and just return one of the two items.</p>  <p>But if they wanted a specific item...</p>  <pre><code>x.getItem(0); or x.getItem(1); </code></pre>  <p>Is this possible in Java? I just didn't want 0 to be random and 1 and 2 to be default...because that could get confusing to read later. </p>
