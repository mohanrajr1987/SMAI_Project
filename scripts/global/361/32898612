<p>I am trying to pass three integers from one method to another method in the same class in Java. </p>  <p>My current code looks like this (but simplified):</p>  <pre><code>import java.util.Scanner;  public class One() {     int var1 = 33;     int var2 = 34;      //these three have to sum to 100     int var3 = 33;      //this is in a while loop in case the three numbers != 100     public int two()     {         Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);         //let user change var1, var2, var3 if they want         if (var1 + var2 + var3 == 100)         {             //I would guess the code for passing the variables is here             break;         }         //else statement     }      public int three()     {          //transfer var1, var2, var3 here and do stuff with it     } } </code></pre>  <p>I have looked this up, and apparently I would have to make an object or an array to pass them into the other method(?). However, I feel like there is a simpler way to go about doing this as I only have two methods in my class. </p>
