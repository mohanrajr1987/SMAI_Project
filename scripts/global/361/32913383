<p>I can't seem to make this work let alone compile and I am at loss at how to fix it. My teacher gave us the following code (simplified for question's sake):</p>  <pre><code>public static void doing1(String s) {     // add code here }  public static void doing2(char start, char end) {     // add code here }  public static int doing3(int num) {     // add code here }  public static void doing4(Scanner keyboard) {     // add code here } </code></pre>  <p>I know what needs to go in each method (the work I mean) I just don't know how to print it out in the main method. We cannot change the code given to us, only add to it.</p>  <p>Thank you!</p>
