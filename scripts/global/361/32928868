<p>I am working on pre-course material for a coding boot camp. So, I'm looking for guidance, not the answer. I'm at a loss for how to approach this question. There is an HTML file that checks each step of the answer. With the code, I've currently written (below), I keep getting this response --"expected {} to have a property 'push'" and the same error for 'pop'. I believe I am adding the methods incorrectly. But I couldn't find any other way to add a method besides using prototype, which applies the method to all Array objects. I also tried doing simple tests which also failed.  </p>  <pre><code>// returns an empty array object. this object should have the following    methods: // push(val) adds val to the end of the array // pop() removes a value from the end and returns it // the goal of this problem is to reverse engineer what array methods are actually doing and return an object that has those methods function createArray() {     //CODE HERE     var array = [];     array.push = function(val){          array[array.length] = val;         return array;        };     array.pop = function(){         return array[array.length-1];     };  } createArray(); console.log(array.push(hey)); </code></pre>  <p>And the error message:</p>  <pre><code>console.log(array.push(hey));             ^ ReferenceError: array is not defined     at Object.&lt;anonymous&gt; (/Users/Fox/Documents/Programming/Codesmith/precourse-part-1/Level-2-Intermediate/src/main.js:67:13)     at Module._compile (module.js:460:26)     at Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:478:10)     at Module.load (module.js:355:32)     at Function.Module._load (module.js:310:12)     at Function.Module.runMain (module.js:501:10)     at startup (node.js:129:16)     at node.js:814:3 </code></pre>  <p>I realize array is a local variable. But once I call the function createArray shouldn't it be global? Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.</p>  <p>I'm new to coding. Please, be gentle.</p>
