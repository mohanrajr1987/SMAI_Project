<p>I'm using Java, and wondering if it's possible to put methods directly into arrays as elements. Something like:</p>  <pre><code>...[] arrayName = {herp(), derp(), jinkies()}; </code></pre>  <p>When I looked this up prior, some people mentioned "reflection," but I don't know what this is (I'm very new to programming). Is there a simple way to put methods into arrays (my goal is to spit them out randomly with a Random, and eventually terminate with a String parameter in each method named "quit" or something)? If not, how does reflection work for this circumstance (if at all)?</p>  <p>I am NOT only asking what reflection is. My exact (main) question is "Is it possible to put methods into arrays," and if it is, how is that done? <em>What is the syntax for it?</em></p>  <p>Thank you for your time</p>
