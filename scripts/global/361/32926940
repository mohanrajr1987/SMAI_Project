<p>Given the following methods:</p>  <pre><code>public int methodOne() {     int total = local_int_one + local_int_two;     return total; }  public int methodTwo() {     return local_int_one + local_int_two; } </code></pre>  <p>1) Is the only difference in the above methods readability or is there a micro-optimization "benefit" in methodTwo()?</p>  <p>2) Should the defining of local variables in a narrow scope be shunned and avoided when possible? (I can see methodTwo becoming unreadable if several calculations must be performed in a single statement)</p>
