<p>I'm working in a project, and recently we have migrated from hibernate 3.0.1 to 3.3.2. After fixing library dependencies and code errors, I've encountered a problem, and the problem is that the method <code>getSchemaSeparator()</code> of <code>Dialect</code> class (<code>org.hibernate.dialect.Dialect</code>) seems to be deprecated and doesnt appear anymore in hibernate 3.3.2.</p>  <p>Here is the code line:</p>  <pre><code>dialect.getSchemaSeparator() </code></pre>  <p>I've googled my problem and searched here for any fix, but nothing found. It seems that there are no such method.</p>  <p>My question is if there any method that can substitude the <code>getSchemaSeparator()</code> method?</p>
