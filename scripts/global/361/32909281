<p>I am following a pluralsite tutorial without source code so I wrote</p>  <pre><code>class Methods {     public void MethodDemo()     {         WriteAsBytes(32);     }      public void WriteAsBytes(int p)     {         byte[] bytes = BitConverter.GetBytes(p);         foreach (byte b in bytes)         {             string message = String.Format("0x{0} ", b);             Debug.Write(message);             Console.Write("{0:X}", 0xffff);              Console.WriteLine("Hey look here " + message);         }         Debug.WriteLine(" space ");         Console.WriteLine(" ");     } } </code></pre>  <p>And looked in the output and debug/output and I see nothing ? This is my first time really working in C# so its more of a visual studio question or just a question of why the consoleWL are also blank?</p>  <p>My output is </p>  <pre><code>The thread 0xb48 has exited with code 259 (0x103). The thread 0x2ffc has exited with code 259 (0x103). The program '[12864] Formating.vshost.exe: Program Trace' has exited with code 0 (0x0). The program '[12864] Formating.vshost.exe' has exited with code 0 (0x0). </code></pre>  <p>and I do not know where the console would be found in a WPF application.</p>
