<p>I am having trouble with a very simple program. I need to call in a method (getNumber) outside of main that takes two numbers from the user and then store those numbers. Those two numbers are then used in a calculation method (math) which is also called into main. I am getting an uninitialized local variable for my two numbers I am calling in from getNumber. I would like the user to enter two numbers have them added together and display the result but by calling in methods. </p>  <pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt; #include &lt;string&gt;  using namespace std;   int getNumber(int x, int y) {                                                 // here is where the user is prompted to input two numbers  cout &lt;&lt; "Please enter two values" &lt;&lt; endl;  cin &gt;&gt; x &gt;&gt; y;  return x, y; }   int math(int x , int y)                             // here is where the    calculations are done  {  int result;  result = x + y;   return result;   }  int main() { int x; int y;  int result;     x = getNumber(x, y);     // trying to call in the input method here   result=math(x,y);       // calling in claculation method   cout &lt;&lt; result;  system("pause");  return 0;  } </code></pre>
