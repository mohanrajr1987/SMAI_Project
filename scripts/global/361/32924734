<p>I'm in a Java class and I'm having extreme difficulty getting started on the assignment. I do not want the answer but I really would appreciate any and all help on getting going and a basic outline of what to do.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>A supermarket wants to reward its best customer of each day, showing the customer’s name on a screen in the supermarket. For that purpose, the customer’s purchase amount is stored in an <code>ArrayList&lt;Double&gt;</code> and the customer’s name is stored in a corresponding <code>ArrayList&lt;String&gt;</code>.</p>      <p>Implement a method</p>      <p><code>public static String nameOfBestCustomer(                    ArrayList&lt;Double&gt; sales,                     ArrayList&lt;String&gt; customers)</code></p>      <p>that returns the name of the customer with the largest sale.</p>      <p>Write a program that prompts the cashier to enter all prices and names, adds them to two array lists, calls the method that you implemented, and displays the result. Use a price of 0 as a sentinel.</p> </blockquote>
