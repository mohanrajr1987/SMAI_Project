<p>Am i thinking wrongly about something: Clojure imports upon starting REPL all the Classes in the java.lang package. So one should be able to call methods from these classes without importing them. Now i am trying to play a bit with different classes of java.lang package, and i cant call some public methods in the form <code>(.Method)</code>, for example (.<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Runtime.html#totalMemory()" rel="nofollow">totalMemory</a>) of the Runtime Class throws IllegalArgumentException. Any ideas?</p>
