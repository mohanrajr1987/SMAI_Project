<p>Creating a program that makes use of arrays and pointers and takes several inputs from the user (e.g. Name, Age, etc.) and outputs them into a short story. The story has to be different each time the user runs the program however, like this:</p>  <p><strong>Sample Output:</strong></p>  <pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>What is your name? Donkey How old are you? 30 What is your favorite color? black Donkey is a 30 year old who likes his black laptop... </code></pre>  <p><strong>Sample Output (second run of the same program):</strong></p>  <pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>What is your name? Donkey How old are you? 30 What is your favorite color? black Donkey is a 30 year old who likes his black Toyota Corolla... </code></pre>  <p>I can get the inputs from the user and output them just fine; my problem is randomizing the events which incorporate the users data. I'm not really sure where to even begin. I've looked at <code>rand()</code> but I'm not sure how I'm supposed to incorporate it into my program. Any help would be appreciated!</p>
