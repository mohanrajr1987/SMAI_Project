<p>So, as someone who is fairly new to C, I came across my first SIGSEGV Error.  It appeared in a short C  program that is meant to be a "guess the number" game. It consists of a self-defined function that compares two numbers and a do-while loop with an input inside it. The start and the do-while loop:</p>  <pre><code>#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;  int checkNum(int num1, int num2); //See below for explanation  int main(void) {     int input=0, rand=3; //"Random" number has fixed value for testing      do {         printf("Enter number from 0-10: "); //There is not actual range yet         scanf("%d",input); //Get input     } while(checkNum(input, rand)); //Checks if difference != 0 } </code></pre>  <p>The function for comparing:</p>  <pre><code>//Function for comparing input with "random" number int checkNum(int num1,int num2) { //The two numbers that get compared; First one: input, Second one: "random" rumber     if(num1==num2) {         printf("Correct. The random number was %d",num2);     } else if(num1&lt;num2) {         printf("Wrong. The random number is bigger.");     } else if(num1&gt;num2) {         printf("Wrong. The random number is smaller.");     }     return num2-num1; //Return the difference, leads to 0 if equal } </code></pre>  <p>I suspect the error to be in the function, caused by a missing use of a pointer, but as far as I understand pointers, they don't seem necessary here: I don't change a single variable in the function, and the return only subtracts two values (which are given I assume).</p>  <p>I hope my error isn't too stupid, and I'd like to thank everyone who can help or tries to. (I can post my processor values, altough I am not sure if that will help; If any more information is needed for debugging, please tell me)</p>
