<p>I have a program that returns an error after I've compiled, then run it in g++. I know because when I test this code in Visual Studio that this error is occuring when I try to set a new nodes data pointer equal to something. More specifically, when I try to set <code>n-&gt;data = ch;</code> Visual Studio breaks (stops) at that line of code. For context, here's part of my header file (with <code>n-&gt;data = ch;</code> towards the end):</p>  <pre><code>#include &lt;ostream&gt;  class LinkedList { public:         LinkedList();         ~LinkedList();          void add(char ch); private:     struct node     {             node();             char data;             node * next;     };     node * head;     node * curr;     node * prev; }; LinkedList::LinkedList() : head(nullptr), curr(nullptr), prev(nullptr); LinkedList::node::node() : data('\0'), next(nullptr); LinkedList::~LinkedList() {     if (!head) // head is null and so list is empty     {             return; //nothing to delete     }      for(curr = head; head; /* head isn't NULL*/ delete curr /*delete first element*/)     {             curr = head;  // set curr to head of list             head = curr-&gt;next;  // move head over to next element (or make it null)     } } void LinkedList::add(char ch) {     node * n = nullptr;     n-&gt;next = nullptr; //my compiler doesn't like this     n-&gt;data = ch; // or this     //irrelevant code after this. } </code></pre>  <p>I wish I could give you guys more context, but I'm clueless as to why this isn't working. Even if it <em>does</em> have something to do with C strings, I don't know what to do to fix this.</p>
