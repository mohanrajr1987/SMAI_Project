<p>I pass a pointer of a given type to a function. In the function I allocate the memory needed:</p>  <pre><code>Pointer = (mytype * ) malloc (N* sizeof (mytype)); </code></pre>  <p>And it all goes well. After the function ends another one calls pointer.</p>  <p>But the previously filled pointer is now without memory.</p>  <p>Shouldn't pointer have kept its filled memory? </p>  <p>Or does the ending of a function deallocate the memory?</p>  <p>Sorry but I am unable to paste my code because I work on a non connected PC.</p>
