<p>i have a very hard issue here, i looked the Parse.com js sdk at least 3 times now but can't figure this out.</p>  <p>I have a Question Class with text, user, comments. I have a Comment Class with text, user.</p>  <p>Comments are placed in an array of pointers on the Question Class.</p>  <pre><code>Question = Parse.Object.extend('Question'); question = new Question(); question.set('text', 'my first question');  // the user posting the question var acl = new Parse.ACL(Parse.User.current());  acl.setPublicReadAccess(true); question.setACL(acl); question.set('user', Parse.User.current()); question.save(); </code></pre>  <p>here everything fine. Now another user log's in the app and post a comment</p>  <pre><code>question; // let's asume the question is fetched Comment = Parse.Object.extend('Comment'); comment = new Comment(); comment.set('text', 'my first comment on the first question');  // the user posting the comment (another user) // this user is have public read rights on the comment but not write rights // he has the write rights on his comment though  var acl = new Parse.ACL(Parse.User.current());  acl.setPublicReadAccess(true); comment.setACL(acl); comment.set('user', Parse.User.current()); comment.save();  // comment is saved we can now add it to the question's array question.add(comment); question.save(); // this is where everything fails...  </code></pre>  <p>it says user don't have the right to write on the question object which is normal but how can the comment be saved if i don't save the question with the new array ?</p>
