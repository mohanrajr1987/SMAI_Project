<p>My goal with this program is to incorporate the users inputs into a sort of interactive/randomized story but I'm not sure how I'm supposed to get the inputs from the users to fit between <code>*ptrDescription</code>, <code>*ptrBeginning</code>, <code>*ptrMiddle</code>, and <code>*ptrEnd</code>. Any help would be much, much appreciated!</p>  <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include&lt;stdlib.h&gt; #include&lt;time.h&gt; #include &lt;string.h&gt; #include &lt;ctype.h&gt;  int main(void){      int i;     char name[20];     char color[20];     int age;     char sentence[1];     //array of pointers to char arrays     char *ptrDescription[]={"the painfully handsome","the one and only","who seemed much older than"};     char *ptrBeginning[]={"was blissfully ignoring","could clearly see","had no idea"};     char *ptrMiddle[]={"the huge truck","the falling meteor","the bucket of milk","the mailman","the most powerful wizard"};     char *ptrEnd[]={"that was barreling toward them.","on the horizon."};      srand(time(NULL));      printf("Enter your first name: ");     scanf("%s", &amp;name);     printf("\nEnter your age: ");     scanf("%d", &amp;age);     printf("\nEnter your favorite color: ");     scanf("%s", &amp;color);       for (i = 0; i &lt; 1; i++)     {         //strcpy(sentence,ptrDescription[rand()%3]);         //strcat(sentence," ");         //strcat(sentence,ptrBeginning[rand()%3]);         //strcat(sentence," ");         //strcat(sentence,ptrMiddle[rand()%5]);         //strcat(sentence," ");         //strcat(sentence,ptrEnd[rand()%2]);         //strcat(sentence,".");         //sentence[0]=toupper(sentence[0]);          puts(sentence);     }      getch();     return 0; } </code></pre>  <p>EDIT:</p>  <p>I've edited a section of my code so that directly following <code>for (i = 0; i &lt; 1; i++)</code> it now looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>snprintf(sentence, sizeof sentence,"%s, %s %d year old, %s %s %s %s", name, ptrDescription[rand()%3], age,ptrBeginning[rand()%3], ptrMiddle[rand()%5], ptrEnd[rand()%2]); </code></pre>  <p>There are tons of strange characters after the sentence in the output, like Japanese characters and stuff. I'm not sure why they're there, though. This is what it looks like exactly:</p>  <p>"Enter your first name: Justin</p>  <p>Enter your age: 20 Justin, the arrogant 20 year old, was purposefully ignoring the most powerful wizard that was barreling toward them. 汽$0HβHζ(ﾃﾌﾌﾌﾌﾌﾌﾌﾌﾌﾌﾌﾌﾌH・(DｷHH広$0陏&amp;・汽$0ﾀHζ(ﾃﾌﾌﾌﾌﾌﾌﾌﾌﾌﾌﾌﾌﾌﾌﾌH WH・ H櫛H・t9HνHﾃ&lt;"</p>  <p>Anyone know how I can get rid of them?</p>
