<p>I have a dataframe with a column called Dir that contains five values: N, S, E, W and C. I've  split them into separate dataframes like so:</p>  <pre><code>df_N = df[(df['Dir'] == 'N')] df_S = df[(df['Dir'] == 'S')] df_E = df[(df['Dir'] == 'E')] df_W = df[(df['Dir'] == 'W')] df_C = df[(df['Dir'] == 'C')] </code></pre>  <p>However I'd like to create a function or list comprehension that does this for me so if the values in the data change, I don't have to re-code it.</p>  <p>I've created a list of the values like so:</p>  <pre><code>CP_Vals = Series.unique(dftc2['iDir']).tolist() </code></pre>  <p>But not having a great deal ofd experience in Python, I'm struggling to create something that automates this. I was thinking something like:</p>  <pre><code>for x in CP_Vals:     df_x = df[(df['iDir'] == '%s' % x)] </code></pre>  <p>Is this possible? Thanks in advance!</p>
