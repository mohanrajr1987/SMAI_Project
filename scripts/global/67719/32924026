<p>For example, instead of writing:</p>  <pre><code>cast[(cast['title'] == "Hamlet") &amp; (cast['year'] == 1921)] </code></pre>  <p>is it possible to write something along the lines of this:</p>  <pre><code>cast[('title' == "Hamlet") &amp; ('year' == 1921)] </code></pre>  <p>and have Pandas infer the DataFrame name? I know the first is creating a boolean Series and that's how Pandas works, but I'm hoping there's a way to write what looks to me to be cleaner code and have it still work in these cases.</p>
