<p>I have a Pandas DataFrame that contains duplicate entries. Some items are also listed twice or three times. I would like to filter it so that it only shows items that are listed at least n times. In the final table all items should only be shown once. The DataFrame contains 3 columns: [colA, colB, colC]. It should only consider colB in determining whether the item is listed multiple times. Note: this is not drop_duplicates. It's the opposite, I would like to drop items that are in the dataframe less than n times.</p>
