<p>I have a database that contains multiple tables, and I am trying to import each table as a pandas dataframe. I can do this for a single table as follows:</p>  <pre><code>import pandas as pd import pandas.io.sql as psql import pypyodbc  conn = pypyodbc.connect("DRIVER={SQL Server};\                         SERVER=serveraddress;\                         UID=uid;\                         PWD=pwd;\                         DATABASE=db")  df1 = psql.read_frame('SELECT * FROM dbo.table1', conn) </code></pre>  <p>The number of tables in the database will change, and at any time I would like to be able to import each table into its own dataframe. How can I get all of these tables into pandas?</p>
