<p>I am trying to count which strings in a pandas dataframe are substrings of a given string. I don't want to use lists or loops but would like to use succinct pandas-internal syntax to accomplish this.</p>  <p>I just can't get the logics to work. This is what I have:</p>  <pre><code>import pandas  given = 'abcdef'  df = pandas.DataFrame(['abc', 'cde', 'aaa'],columns=['A'])  matches = df[(df.A in given)] </code></pre>  <p>What I want is a subframe of <code>df</code> that only contains entries satisfying the boolean condition. I can't be that hard ... but I seem to be unable to get it right.</p>
