<p>I have a Pandas dataframe with sport results per tournament as follows (simplified):</p>  <pre><code>Tournament  WinnerName  LoserName t1          A           X t1          B           Y t1          C           Y t2          A           X t2          B           Y t2          C           Y </code></pre>  <p>In a dictionary I have information about the players' ranks per tournament:</p>  <pre><code>Tournament  Player  Rank t1          A       1 t1          B       7 t1          C       70 t2          A       11 t2          B       1 t2          C       100 </code></pre>  <p>Now I want to know how often <em>per tournament</em> the winner of a match is ranked in one of these categories: a) between 1 and 10, b) between 11 and 49, c) greater than 49.</p>  <p>So the result could either look like this:</p>  <pre><code>Tournament  WinnerName  LoserName   Group t1          A           X           a t1          B           Y           a t1          C           Y           c t2          A           X           b t2          B           Y           a t2          C           Y           c </code></pre>  <p>or like this:</p>  <pre><code>Tournament  WinnerName  LoserName   GroupA  GroupB  GroupC t1          A           X           1       0       0 t1          B           Y           1       0       0 t1          C           Y           0       0       1 t2          A           X           0       1       0 t2          B           Y           1       0       0 t2          C           Y           0       0       1 </code></pre>  <p>After that I can easily count the occurrences per column. But currently I am stuck in achieving one of the two given results. I know it should work somehow with <code>apply</code> or <code>transform</code>, but I have no precise idea unfortunately. Maybe there is even a better solutions to achieve this?</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
