<p>I have a binary matrix which have the following structure</p>  <pre><code>df = pd.DataFrame({"col1": [0,1,0,1,1],                 "col2": [1,0,1,0,0],"col3": [1,1,1,0,1],"col4": [1,0,0,1,0]},index=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']) </code></pre>  <p>This is the current <code>df</code> <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/YsHt8.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/YsHt8.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>And I am applying some similarity measure(jaccard distance) to each row and I want to have this type of item-item matrix by the end(the intersections values should comes from <code>jaccard</code> function\not actual values used here). Final outcome should be like this.</p>  <pre><code>  a  b  c  d  e a 0  3  2  1  1 b    0  1  2  3  c       0  1  4 d          0  2  e             0  </code></pre>  <p>I have the jaccard similarity function defined as <code>jaccard()</code> I only want to know how to apply it to <code>df</code> so that I can have this type of representation matrix by the end. Thank You!</p>
