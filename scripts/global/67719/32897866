<p>I have been using Pandas for a while but I am new to HDF5 so I am trying to learn it and convert some of my research datafiles to HDF5 files. I've looked through a bunch of the SO posts about python and HDF5 and I am interested in using the BLOSC compression algorithm (We do a lot of calculations with the data sets so read/write speed is a higher priority than storage size). </p>  <p>In using the pandas.to_hdf I have run into issues with blosc compression library. When I use blosc, python crashes and when I open the debug in Visual Studio 2010 I get </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Unhandled exception at 0x00007ffcd59fa28c in python.exe: 0xC0000374: A heap has been corrupted.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I have set up a separate example in a script and get the same issue:</p>  <pre><code>import pandas as pd  test = pd.DataFrame() test['random1'] = np.random.randn(1000000) test['random2'] = np.random.randn(1000000) test['random3'] = np.random.randn(1000000)  # Write out a csv first to compare file sizes test.to_csv('./examples/data/random_3c.csv')  # Write out using different compression algorithms to compare test.to_hdf('./examples/data/random_3c_zlib.h5',             key='Random_3Col', mode='w', format='table',              append=False, complevel=9, complib='zlib', fletcher32=True)  test.to_hdf('./examples/data/random_3c_blosc.h5',             key='Random_3Col', mode='w', format='table',              append=False, complevel=9, complib='blosc', fletcher32=True) </code></pre>  <p>The csv writes out fine (file size of 65,217 kb)<br> The zlib compression writes out fine (files size of 21,719 kb)<br> the blosc compression crashes the kernel and I get a heap corruption message when I open the debug in VS<br> My pandas version is 0.16.2<br> My PyTables version is 3.2.0<br> I also have installed hdf5 from the hdfgroup<br> And I'm working on a windows machine</p>  <p>At this point I'm not even really sure how to start tracking down what's causing the crash. Any suggestions or has anyone seen this before? I found some cases of people having issues on SO when trying to use an external blosc library but I haven't come close to touching that yet. I figure I'll get the basics working first! As far as I know pandas is using pytables which comes bundled with a version of blosc. </p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
