<p>I am having a dataframe that contains the following data:</p>  <pre><code>Estimate     Value       Announce date      Period       Company Estimate 1:  0,24        01-01-2015         31-12-2015     X Estimate 2:  0,22        08-04-2015         31-12-2015     X Estimate 3   0,26        07-05-2015         31-12-2014     Y Estimate 4:  0,29        21-09-2015         31-12-2014     Y Estimate 5:  0,21        30-09-2015         31-12-2013     Z </code></pre>  <p>I would like to include only the <strong>earliest</strong> estimate <strong>per period</strong> and per <strong>company</strong>. </p>  <p>Example: Company x has for the period 31-12-2015 two estimates, 1 and 2, but estimate 1 has an earlier announce date than estimate 2. So I would like to delete the row for estimate 2, and then this for every period and company.</p>  <p>Announce date, and period are both in <code>datetime</code> format.</p>  <p>What is a proper method to do this? </p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
