<p>I was looking through Brandon Rhodes' <a href="https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/pycon-pandas-tutorial/blob/master/style-table.css" rel="nofollow">Pandas CSS file</a>, and I'm struggling to find what the HTML looks like for a Pandas DataFrame.</p>  <p>Basically I'm trying to figure out how to freeze the DataFrame's header row so I can view the header even if I scroll down.  But I don't have any insight into what the raw HTML looks like so I can access divs and classes.  How would I find it?</p>
