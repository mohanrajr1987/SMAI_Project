<p>I need to modify a python pandas dataframe. Consider</p>  <pre><code>Id    Col 1     a 2     a 3     p 3     sp 4     n 4     sn 5     b 6     c </code></pre>  <p>is my dataframe. Ids 3 and 4 appear twice. For rows having Id 3, Col has values p and sp. Similarly for Id 4 we see values n and sn in Col. I want to remove row having Col as p for Id 3 and row having Col as n for Id 4. So i wnat my dataframe to look like</p>  <pre><code>Id    Col 1     a 2     a 3     sp 4     sn 5     b 6     c </code></pre>  <p>so basically, here is what i need to do</p>  <ol> <li><p>Check if ther are any duplicates. Lets assume that the duplicates only occur in pairs and not in triples or more.</p></li> <li><p>Then if the value of the Col is same, then we keep only one such row.</p></li> <li>If the values in the Col are p and sp, i want to keep the row that has sp.</li> <li>If the values in the Col are n and sn, i want to keep the row that has sn.</li> </ol>  <p>how can i achieve this?</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>  <p>actually, ideally i would need to check before deciding which row to drop. Lets say i know that there are multiple rows with Id 3 and the corresponding values of Col are</p>  <pre><code>p sp </code></pre>  <p>now i want to collect these values in a list as</p>  <pre><code>['p','sp'] </code></pre>  <p>and send it to a function like</p>  <pre><code>def giveMeBest(paramList):     bestVal = ""     for param in paramList:     '''     some logic goes here    '''    return bestVal </code></pre>  <p>then i only keep the row which has value bestVal in Col. Note that this will also allow me to handle any number of duplicates.</p>
