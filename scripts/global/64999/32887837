<p>I had a <a href="https://jenkins-ci.org/" rel="nofollow">Jenkins</a> server setup on Mac OS environment. It had one buildNumberUpdate job, which makes exactly what it's name says. When this job is done, other 8 build jobs are started simultaneously(actually 3, because that's my executors limit setup). All these jobs checkout the same repo, and build it's workspace with different schema(target). </p>  <p>The last step of each job is deploy to iTunesConnect. The problem is that if two builds finish at exactly the same time, iTMSTransporter gives following error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Cannot proceed with delivery: an existing transporter instance is   currently uploading this package</p> </blockquote>  <p>My best guess is this is caused by <code>.token</code> file being already used from let's say JobA, when JobB want's to used it too for uploading. After some research I found this SO topic:</p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24884261/executing-multiple-instances-of-itmstransporter">Executing multiple instances of iTMSTransporterProtocol</a></p>  <p>The guy over there had probably the very same issue and sayed he fixed it by making folder unique. However my folders are already unique, as Jenkins make folder for each separate job. So he's probably talking for making separate folder for each iTMST token, but I do not know how to do that. As far as I know this token on MAC OS is stored here:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>/Users/<code>&lt;username&gt;</code>/.itmstransporter/UploadTokens/</p> </blockquote>  <p>If you know any other possible cause of this error I'm eager to discuss them :)</p>
