<p>I have done the usual steps of making the <code>xcodebuild</code> work on jenkins, which would be installing "keychain &amp; provisioning profiles" plugin, uploading the right keychain+profiles in the plugin's configuration, and using <code>security -v unlock-keychain</code>, and <code>PROVISIONING_PROFILE</code> in the <code>xcodebuild</code> command.</p>  <p>the build goes forward O.K., even runs the defined <code>postbuild</code> scripts defined in the Xcode project, and creates the <code>.app</code> folder with all the necessary content, but fails here...</p>  <pre><code>/Users/Shared/Jenkins/Home/jobs/iOS_feature/workspace/build/Applications/MyApp.app/Frameworks/libswiftUIKit.dylib: User interaction is not allowed. *** error: Couldn't codesign /Users/Shared/Jenkins/Home/jobs/iOS_feature/workspace/build/Applications/MyApp.app/Frameworks/libswiftUIKit.dylib: codesign failed with exit code 1 </code></pre>  <p>Any ideas what could cause this? from what I understand, the Keychain+ProvisioningProfiles are in place since the build doesn't fail <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/999313/iphone-app-signing-a-valid-signing-identity-matching-this-profile-could-not-be">here</a>.</p>
