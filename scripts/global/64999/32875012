<p>I have spent days now trying different approaches to get Jenkins trigger when we accept a Merge Request. Unfortunately, I can't get anything to work on our system. I have tried different plugins from Jenkins side of things to trigger GitLab, but they seem not to work either. Adding parameterized strings and adding token to end of URL's, I have tried them all - maybe not in correct order, I'm not sure.</p>  <p>I would like a nice configuration to tell me exactly what settings I have to setup and which plugins to use. I have uploaded most plugins for webhooks and merge request plugins, but none of them really work.</p>  <p>Then, next question is how do I debug what is coming from GitLab over to Jenkins? Do you look at system logs? There seem to be a lot of stuff there, and the same with /var/log/Jenkins/jenkins.log file.</p>  <p>Any help/suggestions is very much appreciated.</p>  <p>GitLab version: 7.12.2 Jenkins version: 1.620</p>
