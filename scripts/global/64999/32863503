<p>I'm using <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Gerrit+Trigger" rel="nofollow">Gerrit Trigger plugin</a> to build on gerrit merge event. I don't want any new builds to be triggered if one build is already running. How can I achieve this? Quiet period is working only in the way that it just waits the set amount of time before starting, but build queue gets enlarged anyway.</p>
