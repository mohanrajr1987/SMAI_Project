<p>I am using Jenkins ver. 1.629, and am using the JSON api to read statistics about our builds.</p>  <pre><code>http://jenkins/job/MyProject/25/api/json </code></pre>  <p>This call behaves correctly, however, since the artifacts of my build has a lot of files, the returned JSON has a large array for the artifacts.  The difference is 6.8mb with artifacts, and 16kb without.</p>  <p>Since I do not need to know the list of files in the artifact, I would like to know how to omit it from the JSON result (on the server).</p>  <p>Note: I don't want to zip my artifacts to make the list smaller as I have another project that relies on the artifacts and needs them unzipped, I do not want to zip it and unzip it unnecessarily.</p>
