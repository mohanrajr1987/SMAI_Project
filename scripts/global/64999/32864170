<p>I am using OClint for the static code analysis of my iOS app and using jenkins as the dev ops operandi. The shell command am using for this is as follows : oclint-json-compilation-database -- -report-type pmd -o oclint.xml -stats -max-priority-1=10000 -max-priority-2=10000 -max-priority-3=10000 and it runs fine but doesn't give any return on the cyclometic complexity. Can some tell what command shall I add further to this to have the desired result. Thanks in advance.</p>
