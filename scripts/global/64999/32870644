<p>I want to create a modular process which will merge the "devel" branch upon each successful build to the master branch, and it will also create a tag. Is there any way to do it using Jenkins and Git plugin rather than writing code. If yes, is there any option to provide Git plugin the repository URL as a parameter, so it will be as modular as possible. The job that I want to create will be performing only the merge (<code>git merge --no-commit -X theirs</code>) operation and it will create a tag (the tag name will be provided as a parameter as well).This job will be triggered by other jobs.</p>
