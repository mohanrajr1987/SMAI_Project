<p>I have a jenkins master and a separate slave server. I using swarm plugin to connecting the slaves to the master. Everything works fine before I configured LDAP authetication and revoke the grants from the anonymous user. </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/oDlsv.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/oDlsv.png" alt="enter image description here"></a> Obviously now I have to autheticate swarm client but I cannot able to do this. If anyone has experience with swarm plugin please let me know.</p>  <p>Console from slave machine:</p>  <pre><code>$ java -jar swarm-client-2-0.jar -master http://x.x.x.x:8080/ -username 'exxxx' -password common.pwd Discovering Jenkins master Oct 01, 2015 2:14:51 PM org.apache.commons.httpclient.auth.AuthChallengeProcessor selectAuthScheme INFO: basic authentication scheme selected Oct 01, 2015 2:14:51 PM org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpMethodDirector processWWWAuthChallenge INFO: Failure authenticating with BASIC 'Jenkins'@x.x.x.x:8080 Failed to fetch slave info from Jenkins CODE: 401 Retrying in 10 seconds </code></pre>  <p>Br,</p>
