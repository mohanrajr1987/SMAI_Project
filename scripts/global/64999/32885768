<p>How are you? I have a problem with one idea. Can't realize it.<br> I have one maven project with automated tests (selenium). Lets call it "Tester" Have second job for another maven project that download data from database and create this db on docker using vagrant with data that it downloaded. Let's call it "Creator"</p>  <p>Now I want to create something like this. After pushing changes I want Creator to run itself. There's bash script that runs vagrant and in the middle run maven tests that download that data and upload into new database. Had to make it through json, cause some data is serialized. But that's not the point. And I have a ready db with running application on it.</p>  <p>Then I want to run Tester to test this environment. </p>  <p>After test passed or not it pings Creator to end itself. Destroying app and db.</p>  <p>How can I achive this in jenkis?</p>  <p>Standard triggers does not allow me to run another job in the middle of the current job. Yes, I know i'd be blocking two builders on jenkis, but that does not matter. Its acceptable.</p>  <p>Or is there any other solution for this?</p>
