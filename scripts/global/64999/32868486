<p>I am looking for possible solutions for maintaining Jenkins jobs and plugins configuration in Git. My motivation is easy (perhaps automated) backup of changes made on the Jenkins instance as well as fast recovery in case I need to set-up a new Jenkins instance / revert to a previous version of the configuration.</p>  <p>I came across <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/SCM+Sync+configuration+plugin" rel="nofollow">SCM Sync configuration plugin</a> and <a href="http://docs.openstack.org/infra/jenkins-job-builder/" rel="nofollow">Jenkins Job Builder</a> and having a hard time figuring whether these solutions are suitable for me and what are the differences between them.</p>  <p>Any information to help me determine the differences and choose the appropriate fit for my needs?</p>
