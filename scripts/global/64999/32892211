<p>I have a Jenkins project set up to poll Git every 5 minutes and build any new or updated branches.</p>  <p>However, I would also like the option to trigger a manual build of the project on a specific branch. I have experimented with using parameters to determine the branch to build, but everything I have tried has broken the polling, so new branches are not built automatically.</p>  <p>I would prefer to keep everything in one project, so that all test results will be aggregated there. At this point, it's not as important that I have a list of branches to choose from, only that I have some way to specify the branch.</p>  <p>How can I trigger a manual build for this project without breaking polling?</p>
