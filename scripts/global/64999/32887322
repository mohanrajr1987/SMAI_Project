The console output is:</p>  <p>Recording test results ERROR: Publisher 'Publish JUnit test result report' failed: No test report files were found. Configuration error? Finished: FAILURE</p>  <p>I've include a "Publish JUnit test result report" in my Post-build Actions, with the path of the Test report XMLs </p>  <pre><code>**/build/test-results/**/*.xml </code></pre>
