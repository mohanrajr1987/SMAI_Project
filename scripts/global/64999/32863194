<p>I am using Jenkins to build project. I am able to build Project. I need to copy the war file in target location. I can copy the .war file using <code>cp source_file_location target_file_location</code> it will do the job. But I want to check if the file already exist show message old file found  then delete the old file and copy the new file in target location.</p>  <p>and zip the target location folder and copy in x place.</p>  <p>I am really sorry. It seems I  have just given the requirement. I really don't know how to write shell script except some basic command. can any body help me?      </p>
