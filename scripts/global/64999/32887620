<p>My SSH code runs fine and I get the desired output as well. But, in the output displayed the whole SSH exec command is printed. How can I stop displaying the exec command in output. I don't want to use scripts as well.</p>  <p>Below is the SSH command:</p>  <pre><code>#!/bin/bash echo "Hello World" </code></pre>  <p>Output:</p>  <pre><code>SSH: EXEC: STDOUT/STDERR from command [#!/bin/bash echo "Hello World"]      ... Hello World SSH: EXEC: completed after 201 ms </code></pre>  <p>I want to remove the SSH exec command and display only the output of the SSH exec command.</p>
