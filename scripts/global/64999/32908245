<p>I have a Windows 7 and I am testing an Android Native app using Appium using Java. The framework used is TestNG. I would like to use Jenkins for running smoke testing for builds available in Jenkins. My desired capabilities are listed in <code>@Before</code>. Can we dynamically paremetrize all of the following in Jenkins?</p>  <pre><code>“automationName” “platformName” “platformVersion” “deviceName” “app” “appPackage” “appActivity“ </code></pre>  <p>If so How?</p>  <p>Now if I dynamically parametrize, what would happen to the desired capabilities in my script <code>@Before</code></p>
