<p>I have a project with a complicated ant build that we would like to remain as ant at the moment (will be converted to maven eventually).</p>  <p>I am using jenkins at the moment to build/test our application. After build/test, I now want to push the built artefact to a Nexus repository. </p>  <p>For a Maven project, I can use the post build action "Deploy Artefacts to Maven Repository" to do this.</p>  <p>Whats the best way to structure my Jenkins jobs to achieve an ant build and then deploy the code to Nexus?</p>
