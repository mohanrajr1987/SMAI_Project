<p>I need to execute some action after build has been deleted (by user or automatically) on Jenkins.</p>  <p>Actually, I need the following:</p>  <ol> <li>Send http-request with info about deleted build. </li> <li>Delete build artifacts on remote location.</li> </ol>  <p>About #2: I use Artifact Deployer plugin to deploy build, but because of issue <a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-26109" rel="nofollow">https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-26109</a> build is not deleting on remote location after build has been deleted.</p>  <p>Any way, how I can do something on deleting build? Maybe I have to write script or create plugin?</p>
