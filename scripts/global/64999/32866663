<p>My requirement is to get the perforce change-list details from the last successful build to the latest successful build.</p>  <p>For Eg: I have Jenkins builds like below</p>  <p>JOB1:build#112 - Successful</p>  <p>JOB1:build#113 - Failed</p>  <p>JOB1:build#114 - Failed</p>  <p>JOB1:build#115 - Successful</p>  <p>I want Jenkins to show all p4 change-list in the build#115 that went in for build#113 and build#114 . Jenkins always show the p4 change-list between the last two build regardless of failure or successful build. I need this to generate the report that the particular successful build has these many p4 check-ins. </p>
