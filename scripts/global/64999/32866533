<p>I am using GitLab, Jenkins and SonarQube. All tools are with <em>Free</em> licences.</p>  <p>Currently we are having a need to implement more strict control over Git(Labs) Merge Request functionality based on "external" tools / plugins.</p>  <p>I am now trying to figure out how to implement the behaviour that would do the following:</p>  <ul> <li>listen to Jenkins Job build result</li> <li>while GitLab has no result from Jenkisn Job, button "Accept Merge Request" is disabled.</li> <li>once the result is recieved and it is Positive ( Thumbs Up icon ), button gets enabled.</li> </ul>  <p>Could you please provide sample or redirect to some already working solution?</p>
