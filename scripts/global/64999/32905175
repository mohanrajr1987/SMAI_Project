<p>I have a grunt task that builds my static application into a <code>dist</code> folder, I serve this locally using a simple <code>Node.js</code> server together with the <code>Express.js</code> framework.</p>  <p>In order to run on <code>Heroku</code> I have a <code>Procfile</code> that simply calls the web server and everything works fine.</p>  <p>I dislike having to manually <code>git push heroku master</code> every time I want to deploy my app. I like having a <code>Jenkins</code> job set up. </p>  <p>My issue with how <code>Heroku</code> apps are deployed is that it requires a push to a repo, I would prefer to create a static resource and push this into the <code>Heroku</code> app instance from my <code>Jenkins</code> job.</p>  <p>I have found a <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-scala-and-play-applications-with-the-heroku-sbt-plugin" rel="nofollow">link</a> on <code>Heroku</code> that describes how to do this with a <code>Scala</code> application. My question is this - has any one been able to create a Jenkins job where a <code>Node.js</code> app is deployed to <code>Heroku</code> via their API as opposed to deploy via <code>Git</code>?</p>
