<p>I installed Jenkins on my Windows PC with Windows Installer. It ran successfully in localhost:8080 but I wanted to run in localhost/jenkins or jenkins.localhost. I tried adding the following virtual host to my http-vhost.conf but it doesnt work.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost *:8080&gt;     ServerName jenkins.localhost     ServerAlias jenkins.localhost     ProxyPass / http://localhost:8080/     ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:8080/ &lt;/VirtualHost&gt; </code></pre>  <p>What am i doing wrong?</p>
