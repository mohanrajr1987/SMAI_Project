<p>I am using Jenkins to run builds that end up pushing large amounts of data to a database. To make it easier to manage the database I would like to run a script on build log deletion that would delete the associated tables in the database.</p>  <p>My searching has uncovered lots of ways to trigger build log deletion but I haven't found any about triggering something on build log deletion.</p>  <p>I also tried looking at writing a plugin to do this but browsing the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Extension+points" rel="nofollow">extension points</a> didn't turn up any obvious way to hook into that.</p>  <p>In case it turns out to be useful this is Ubuntu 14.04 server and Jenkins 1.631</p>
