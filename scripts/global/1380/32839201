<p>For some reasons, I'd like to analyze the code coverage of my application with PHP_CodeCoverage, but not by using PHP unit (with manual testing).</p>  <p>I know how to use XDebug on the long run (across multiple requests, by keeping the code coverage analysis into the shared memory). Building simple XML files such as clover.xml (or any other format) after some tests is not difficult with the output of XDebug  (it is a simple associative array and it is documented).</p>  <p>Is there a way to instruct PHP_CodeCoverage to use clover.xml (or another file format) so as to generate the HTML report (which is very good). Or do you know a simple hack that would rely on PHP_CodeCoverage internal function to deal directly with the output of XDebug so as to generate the HTML report.</p>
