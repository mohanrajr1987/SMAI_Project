<p>Is there a phpdoc-compliant way* of expressing the various returned values in a PHPUnit dataProvider?</p>  <p>For example:</p>  <pre><code>return array(     array(false, 17, array(1,2)),     array(true, 19, array(1,2)), ); </code></pre>  <p>I would like to write something more detailed than <code>@return array</code>, that expresses that the first value passed to the test method is a bool, the second is an integer, third is an array (and also what each of these values represent).</p>  <p>* If there's no compliant way, does anyone have tips on how to document in a clear manner?</p>
