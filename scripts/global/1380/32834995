<p>I have two Silverstripe websites running in the same WAMP 2.5 environment, sharing the same _ss_environment.php file (which sets database permissions etc.)</p>  <p>Both are:</p>  <ul> <li>Silverstripe 3.2.0RC1</li> <li>Installed/ updated via Composer</li> <li>PHPUnit 3.7.28</li> </ul>  <p>When I go to localhost.example/dev/tests I get completely different behaviour:</p>  <p>Site #1 runs the tests without any issues and returns the expected output.</p>  <p>Site #2 won't run any test and comes back with this sort of error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Couldn't run query:</p>      <p>SELECT DISTINCT "Group"."ClassName", "Group"."LastEdited",   "Group"."Created", "Group"."Title", "Group"."Description",   "Group"."Code", "Group"."Locked", "Group"."Sort",   "Group"."HtmlEditorConfig", "Group"."ParentID", "Group"."ID",             CASE   WHEN "Group"."ClassName" IS NOT NULL THEN "Group"."ClassName"             ELSE   'Group' END AS "RecordClassName"</p>      <p>FROM "Group"</p>      <p>WHERE ("Group"."ID" = ?)</p>      <p>LIMIT 1</p>      <p>Table 'ss_tmpdb6760406.group' doesn't exist</p> </blockquote>  <p>What the heck is going on?</p>  <p>The Site #2 does have more modules installed but I can't see how that'd affect MySQL permissions/behavior.</p>  <p>The only difference that makes sense to me is Site #1 was a clean composer install on 3.2.0RC1 when Site #2 has been upgraded from an earlier version of Silverstripe (via composer).</p>  <p>Does anyone have any idea of what is going on and how I can get Site #2 to test properly?</p>
