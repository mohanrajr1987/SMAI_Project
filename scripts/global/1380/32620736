<p>Some of my tests rely on times, and for simplicity I use offsets from "now".</p>  <p>I run all my fixtures in the set up for all tests. So when creating objects, I will do something like this:</p>  <pre><code>$start_time = Carbon::now('UTC'); if(($state === 'scheduled') || ($state === 'sent')) {    $start_time-&gt;addHours(5); } elseif ($state === 'complete') {    $start_time-&gt;subMinutes(5); } $entity-&gt;setStartTime($start_time); $manager-&gt;persist($entity); </code></pre>  <p>The problem is, the "now" always seems to be based on the last time I cleared the test cache, or updated the php file the fixtures came from. So when I run the tests over a few minutes and log both the object timestamp and "now" within the test, I get this (when run three times over four minutes):</p>  <pre><code>[2015-09-17 09:40:07] app.INFO: TIME START: 2015-09-17 04:40:06 [] [] [2015-09-17 09:40:07] app.INFO: TIME NOW: 2015-09-16 23:40:07 [] []  [2015-09-17 09:40:24] app.INFO: TIME START: 2015-09-17 04:40:06 [] [] [2015-09-17 09:40:24] app.INFO: TIME NOW: 2015-09-16 23:40:24 [] []  [2015-09-17 09:44:57] app.INFO: TIME START: 2015-09-17 04:40:06 [] [] [2015-09-17 09:44:57] app.INFO: TIME NOW: 2015-09-16 23:44:57 [] [] </code></pre>  <p>This is less than ideal behaviour, as it will start causing tests to fail as the cache gets past five hours old. </p>  <p>It would be nice to have my fixtures based on current times rather than some explicitly specified fixed date that gets older and older, even though that would be a workaround.</p>  <p>I also don't really want to use Carbon::setTestNow($someFixedDate) in the test setup function as I like the idea that my tests get run at all sorts of different times without explicitly specifying times.</p>  <p>Ideally, when I run the tests, the fixtures should actually behave as you would expect them to - using the actual current time to create objects. </p>  <p>I'm using Symfony 2.7, with PHPUnit 4.4.5.</p>
