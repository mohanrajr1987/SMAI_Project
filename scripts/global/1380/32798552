<p>I want to prevent Model events such as 'created'. 'updated' etc when testing my application using phpunit. </p>  <p>In the documentation of Laravel it says that you can prevent events from firing by using </p>  <p><code>$this-&gt;expectsEvents(App\Events\UserRegistered::class);</code></p>  <p>But in my situation I have no class to expect. </p>  <p>I know that I can use <code>$this-&gt;withoutEvents();</code> to prevent all events, but how can I prevent only specific model events?</p>
