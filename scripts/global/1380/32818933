<p>I'm using a plugin for vim, c9/phpunit, for PHPUnit testing, it requires a path to my src, tests, and phpunit directories defined in my vimrc.</p>  <p>At the moment, I use vim-rooter to set my cwd to the root of my repo.</p>  <p>Is there a way to tell c9/phpunit to go to &lt; current-working-directory >/module/Search/src, &lt; current-working-directory >/module/Search/tests, and &lt; current-working-directory >/vendor/phpunit from inside the vimrc so that it automatically gets the required paths when I open a file?</p>
