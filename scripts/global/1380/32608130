<p>I am trying to get the results of a php unit tests folder , but not using the CLI, and instead using a php file.</p>  <p>I would like to get the answer ( OK, 4 tests passed ) in a variable or something so I can decide whether the script should execute or not,  what's the best way to do this? i don't want to use batch files, I want to force the execution of the tests, inside the library itself.</p>  <p>I started with </p>  <p>require_once 'PHPUnit/Autoload.php';</p>  <p>When I included the tests, don't know how to start them thought.</p>  <p>Any advice?</p>
