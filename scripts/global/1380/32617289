<p>I've been trying to setup up PHPUnit in PhpStorm 8.0.1 with no luck. I downloaded phpunit.phar and set the path to the phar in PhpStorm's settings as well as a phpunit configuration file, but when I try to run a test it fails with the following output:</p>  <pre><code>/usr/bin/php /tmp/ide-phpunit.php --no-configuration MyTest /project/MyTest.php Testing started at 9:31 PM ...  Process finished with exit code 1 Cannot find PHPUnit in include path (.:/usr/share/pear) </code></pre>  <p>I'm no expert, but it doesn't seem like it's using the phpunit.phar as the tests run fine when I run</p>  <pre><code>$ phpunit  </code></pre>  <p>in the terminal.</p>
