<p>I'm completing a lab for college and I'm a little stuck on what it is the lecturer wants me to do, we've just started learning C#, the lab wants us to write a console application, using Polymorphism, has 4 classes: Vertex, Shape, Line, Circle and a test.</p>  <p>I have all my classes and most of my methods implemented fine, but I can't figure out what it is he wants us to do in the Translate method, below is the question as it appears on the lab sheet: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Implement 2 methods in Shape, one to return details of the Shape   (ToString() ) and one to allow a shape to be translated in 2D space   (Translate(..)). The amount to be translated should be passed as a   parameter to the translate method (as a reference to a Vertex object   i.e. the amount the object is to be translated with respect to the X   and Y axes).</p> </blockquote>  <p>I'm pretty sure he's not looking for anything as complicated as the solution given here: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3858904/how-to-draw-box-rectangle-in-a-c-sharp-console-application">How to Draw Box,Rectangle in a C# Console application</a></p>  <p>Any suggestions appreciated.</p>  <p>Edit</p>  <p>this is my code so far:</p>  <pre><code> public override void Translate(ref Vertex v)     {       } </code></pre>  <p>The method is implemented as a virtual method in the Shape class and is overridden in the Line and Circle class.</p>
