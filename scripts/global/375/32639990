<p>I have a model <code>Navigation</code> that has a polymorphic <code>target</code>. That <code>target</code> can be a <code>Page</code>, an <code>ExternalLink</code>, or a <code>Plugin</code>. Each of these targets has different attributes (page has <code>content</code>, <code>title</code>, external link has <code>title</code>, <code>url</code>, plugin has its own polymorphic relations.</p>  <p>I'm building a little form to add a Navigation link, and I want to give my users the option to select an existing one of these relations (which is easy enough, just a grouped collection select), but I also would like to let them select a 'New' option for each of these <code>target</code> models.</p>  <p>The question is -- how do I include it in the same form? </p>  <p>I could make a form object, but that feels like the last-resort option. I know I can accept nested attributes for <code>target</code>, but I don't know how to do that with a selection form as well. I know I could do some js hackery to add or remove form elements on selecting or not selecting the 'new' options.</p>  <p>All of these don't feel railsey. This problem feels like a not-uncommon issue, and I imagine this is a solved problem that I'm trying to reinvent the wheel for. What option am I missing? What is the rails way to make this?</p>
