<p>I want to implement a function in a baseclass that uses members of its derived classes. So with each DerivedClass, I would have a member of a different value. Here's an example. The <code>BaseClass</code> has member function <code>Foo()</code> which uses variable <code>arrStr</code>. This content of this NUL terminated char array however is only to be found in a derived class. How can I make <code>BaseClass</code> "know" the variable <code>arrStr</code> without knowing its size? Is that even possible?</p>  <pre><code>    class BaseClass     {     public:         BaseClass();         ~BaseClass();      protected:      void Foo()     {      prtinf("%s\n", arrStr);     };      };      class DerivedClass : public BaseClass         {         public:             DerivedClass();             ~DerivedClass();              protected:              char arrStr[] = "FooString!";      }; </code></pre>
