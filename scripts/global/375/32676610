<p>With regards to this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/32655535/1977152">answer</a>, why doesn't a non-virtual method of the base class gets "name-hidden" when called via a base class pointer pointing to a derived object? I have edited that post to explain what my doubt is but haven't got any response from the fella who answered my <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32655484/ambiguity-in-static-polymorphism/32655535#32655535">previous doubt</a>.</p>
