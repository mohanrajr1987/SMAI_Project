<p>Sorry to bother you fellas. I don't know if this is possible, but I am going to ask it anyway.</p>  <p>Consider a parent class named <code>PowerHost</code>. Consider child class named <code>PowerHostHistory</code> which is like this:</p>  <pre><code>PowerHostHistory extends PowerHost </code></pre>  <p>I have a list of child class defined like this which is constantly filled with <code>PowerHostHistory</code> objects.</p>  <pre><code>List&lt;PowerHostHistory&gt; excludedHosts = new LinkedList&lt;PowerHostHistory&gt;(); </code></pre>  <p>Now, in a bit different way, I am going to add a list of <code>PowerHost</code> objects to my <code>excludedHosts</code>.</p>  <p>Bottom line I want to add add a list of parent objects to a list of child objects. Is that even possible, and how?</p>  <p>I really appreciate your attention. </p>
