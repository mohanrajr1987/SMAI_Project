<p>I'm currently writing a simulator for a card game. I'm trying to code a move generator. I have got a base class "Card" from which I'm deriving every card (around 150 different ones). They are pretty specific so I can't implement them within a single class (and I don't want to use any scripting language).</p>  <p>What I need (want) to do: Code 150 classes derived from "Card". Now I need to generate new objects during runtime and push them into my board.</p>  <p>For example:</p>  <pre><code>std::vector&lt;Card*&gt; board; board.push_back(new Card132()); </code></pre>  <p>So how would I be able to do this - cause I need to decide <strong>during runtime</strong> which object (from which class) I need to generate?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
