<p>I have a base ViewModel that has a public method. Things were pretty simple at first and its role was the same for all of its derived classes, but now we want the ViewModel to do different things depending on which derived class calls it.</p>  <p>So for example we have:</p>  <pre><code>    public void DoMethod()     {         DoThisMethod();     } </code></pre>  <p>we want something like</p>  <pre><code>    public void DoMethod()     {         if (this.GetType().Name == "ThisName")            DoThisMethod();         else            DoAnotherMethod();     } </code></pre>  <p>Is it wrong to do this?</p>
