<p>I have to implement basically the same function but for different size. Specifically it is something like...</p>  <pre><code>type&amp; operator=(unsigned int); type&amp; operator=(unsigned long int); type&amp; operator=(unsigned long long int); type&amp; operator=(int); type&amp; operator=(long int); type&amp; operator=(long long int); type&amp; operator=(short int); //so on and so forth... </code></pre>  <p>They have to do exactly the same thing... (except i should take into account the different size), the main idea would be "if the type is the widest use the code for the task... otherwise perform a casting and execute the code". Is it possible to avoid all such repetitive code by using only one method? (i just don't want the compiler throw me some warning when i compile...).</p>  <p>Thank you</p>
