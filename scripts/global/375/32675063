<pre><code>public class a{   public void sup()   {     System.out.println("1");   }  public class b extends a {   public void sub  {       System.out.println("2");  } </code></pre>  <p>When I instantiate an object like this and run it:</p>  <pre><code>a ob1 = new b(); ob1.sub(); </code></pre>  <p>There would be a compilation error that says the sub() method in ob1 is not defined. If I want to instantiate an object of the class "a" and it could still use the method in class b. What is the appropriate way to do that?</p>
