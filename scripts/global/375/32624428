<p>I played around with inheritances and tried to extend a method from the base class from the subclass. Polymorphism. Basically, I tried to extend the base method (status) with an additional option. </p>  <p>However, for some reason it doesn't work as expected. I thought B.new.status(1) would return 2 instead of nil. </p>  <p>If I place super after "y if opt == 2" then the results are vice verse.</p>  <p>Why is that and how can I solve this problem? </p>  <p>Many thanks in advance!</p>  <pre><code>    class A       attr_reader :x        def initialize         @x = 2       end        def status(opt)         x if opt == 1       end     end      class B &lt; A       attr_reader :y        def initialize         super         @y = 10       end        def status(opt)         super         y if opt == 2       end     end      B.new.status(1)     =&gt; nil     B.new.status(2)     =&gt; 2 </code></pre>
