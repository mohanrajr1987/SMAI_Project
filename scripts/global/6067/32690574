<p>I'm new to C so some clarification would be very helpful! I'm trying to use a scanner to ask my program for a series of words which I will store..what I have so far is,</p>  <pre><code>     char[]listOfWords[9999]; //creates a large array of characters      scanf("%s", listOfWords); //stores inputs into listOfWords </code></pre>  <p>with this, I can access the first word easily, but it comes to a matter of accessing the second, and third words..any suggestion? For example, how my input was</p>  <pre><code> Hello how are you guys </code></pre>  <p>I can access "Hello" no problem,  but how would I call "how" and "are"</p>
