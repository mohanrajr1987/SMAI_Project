<p>So, My script needs to convert a windows share to Unix and pick up file from this Unix location and process it.  Input >  ./script.ksh '\win\SCM\build\process'</p>  <p>Here is the conversion  : BAR_Dir="<code>echo "${BAR_Dir_Win}" | sed -e 's/win/opt/g' -e 's/SCM/samp/g'| sed 's,\\\,/,g'</code>"</p>  <p>and this works good with most of the paths but when the above path is used, there is a "\b" in the structure which is causing a backspace to be inserted and is giving me an output as /opt/samuild/process considering \b as backspace and deleting the "M". Will there be a solution? </p>
