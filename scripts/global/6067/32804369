<p>I just want to ask for an efficient algorithm for Character Recognition/Detection of captured image of a word search game like Boggle or Word Factory game. The idea is that the user will capture an image, the system will recognize the characters from the cube and put it into an array. My propose plan would be something like this</p>  <ol> <li><p>Capture an Image (My idea here is that there is a box from the capture screen and the user will have to capture the board game inside the rectangle or box and after capturing the image, it will automatically crop the background.</p></li> <li><p>Convert the RGB Image to Gray scale.</p></li> <li><p>Apply Image Thresholding (for thresholding, we will use otsu method)</p></li> <li><p>Find contours (we will use the algorithm that opencv use for this)</p></li> <li><p>Recognition of Characters through Classifier </p></li> </ol>  <p>This is where the problem lies. I can't decide which classifier algorithm will we use for best results. What can you suggests guys? Is pattern recognition okay? if so, what algorithm should i use?</p>  <p>Another question would be do you think the process mentioned above would be sufficient for good character recognition? Do i still to reduce noise from the image and use algorithms for that? Is finding contours good than finding edges and using edge algorithm. I want some inputs please. Please feel free to comment and suggest if you have better answers. Thanks and God Bless.</p>
