<p>This is what I have so far:</p>  <pre><code>def stats(filename):     ' prints the number of lines, words, and characters in file filename'     infile = open(filename)     lines = infile.readlines()     words = infile.read()     chars = infile.read()     infile.close()     print("line count:", len(lines))     print("word count:", len(words.split()))     print("character counter:", len(chars)) </code></pre>  <p>When executed, return the number of lines properly, but return 0 for words and character counts. Not sure why...</p>
