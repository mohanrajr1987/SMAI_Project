<p>Sorry if this is a duplicate. It's hard to precisely ask what I need on Google without showing examples.</p>  <p>I want to use an array of chars that are the allowed characters, and then use a method (that has a length parameter) to return a list of all the possible strings using these allowed characters.</p>  <p>For example, if the char[] would contain <code>'A', 'B', 'C'</code> and the given length would be 3 then the results would be</p>  <pre><code>AAA, AAB, AAC, ABA, ABB, ABC, ACA, ACB, ACC, BAA, BAB, BAC, BBA, BBB, BBC, BCA, BCB, BCC, CAA, CAB, CAC, CBA, CBB, CBC, CCA, CCB, CCC </code></pre>  <p>An exact  answer with code is not necessary, as I'm trying to make this out of pure interest and for enjoyment, so hints are welcome to!</p>
