<p>This came up a couple of years ago here: </p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13009203/plot-a-character-vector-against-a-numeric-vector-in-r">Plot a character vector against a numeric vector in R</a></p>  <p>But it doesn't look like it was ever resolved. I'm looking to change the symbology for a plot of a character variable against a quantitative variable (exactly as in the example I linked to). So far, pch does nothing, and I haven't been able to find anything on here resolving this (the author of the post I linked to asked this at the end of the post, but it was never answered). </p>  <p>Thanks for your help. </p>  <p>***Here is the data from the example in the link I posted. </p>  <pre><code>  Mean.Rank Sentence.Type 1       2.5       An+Sp+a 2       2.6      An+Nsp+a 3       2.1       An+Sp-a 4       3.1      An+Nsp-a 5       2.4       In+Sp+a 6       1.7      In+Nsp+a 7       3.1       In+Sp-a 8       3.0      In+Nsp-a </code></pre>  <p>and the code to plot: </p>  <pre><code>plot(Mean.Rank~factor(Sentence.Type), AcceptData, las=2,  xlab="", main="Mean Acceptability Ranking per Sentence") </code></pre>
