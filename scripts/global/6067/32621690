<p>There is a similar question but that didn't answered everything. 1. In layout.xml how can I use double quote? The following code gives an error</p>  <pre><code>&lt;TextView android:layout_height="match_parent" android:text="This is double" quote." //The text have only one double quote (after double)  //This is double" quote. android:layout_width="wrap_content"/&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I tried to use &amp;quot; and \" but neither helped. I can get the double quote from strings.xml but I want to keep the text in layout.xml (It doesn't make sense to write a separate string file if I want to show a small piece of text, like degree-minute-second (Â°'")). How can I do this? </p>  <ol start="2"> <li><p>In strings.xml I cannot use &lt; or &gt;.</p>  <p>&lt;string name="x"&gt;The &lt;sub&gt; terranean tunnel&lt;/string&gt;</p></li> </ol>  <p>The &lt;sub&gt; gets ignored, though I want to show that part (with the less-than and more-than signs). Though I have not tried it but I think that using \&lt;sub\&gt; may help. But in that case if I want to show \&lt;sub\&gt; (with the backslash) how can I do that?</p>  <p>As I said in the first line, I know that this is a duplicate question. But the solution in the other question didn't helped me (&amp;quot; doesn't work for me). Moreover I have asked two questions (2. related with strings.xml). </p>
