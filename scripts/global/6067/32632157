<pre><code>#!/ usr/bin/python3 import sys  def main():     for line in sys.stdin:         line = line.split()         x    = -1         for word in line:             if word[-1]==word[0] or word[x-1]==word[1]:                 print(word)           main() </code></pre>  <p>It also prints dots at the end of the sentences, why? And words like 'cat' and 'moon' should also be out of the question. But it also prints these words.  Can someone point me in the right direction please?</p>
