<p>I have a df with three thousand rows and I would like to create a new column with zeros or ones depending on the word written in a different one. </p>  <p>I have a function which assesses the entry in a column, and if it matches the word I'm looking for, then a "1" is returned in a new column. Like this:</p>  <pre><code> oneorzero &lt;- function(x) {    if (x["col_one"] == "dog") {      return("1")    }    return("0")  }  df["col_two"] = apply(df, 1, oneorzero) </code></pre>  <p>I would like to  be able to apply the logical OR operator so that a one will be added when various different words are encountered like this:</p>  <pre><code> oneorzero &lt;- function(x) {    if (x["col_one"] == "dog" | "cat" | "rat") {      return("1")    }    return("0")  }  df["col_two"] = apply(df, 1, oneorzero) </code></pre>  <p>But of course that doesn't work because logical operators can only be used on numeric values. Does anyone know how this can be done`?</p>
