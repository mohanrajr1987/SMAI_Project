<p>I need to form a regular expression (reg ex) for an .aspx program that validates one character followed by optional characters.</p>  <p>The first character is more strict, not allowing hyphen or space.</p>  <p>I had</p>  <pre><code>^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9 -]{1,9} </code></pre>  <p>which works, except there must be at least two characters (the limit is 9 chars total).</p>  <p>The .net code was as follows:</p>  <pre><code>   controltovalidate="txt1" validationexpression="^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9 -]{1,9}"&gt;&lt;/ASP:REGULAREXPRESSIONVALIDATOR&gt; </code></pre>  <p>[Since asking the question, I've found that simply changing {1,9} to {0,9} accomplishes what I need, but I am retaining the question as possibly useful to others, especially the answer below]</p>  <p>I read that</p>  <pre><code>^[A-Za-z0-9]([A-Za-z0-9 -])?{1,9} </code></pre>  <p>might work as I'm grouping the chars after the first with parens and using a "?" as optional.</p>  <p>However, I really need to know if this is correct syntax before I move this code to production.</p>  <p>Furthermore, it fails an online reg expression validator.</p>  <p>Does anyone know if this will work for an aspx reg expression validator?</p>
