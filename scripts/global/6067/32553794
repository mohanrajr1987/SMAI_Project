<p>I have looked at many issues here and elsewhere on how to set a character limit/countdown script in javascript or query. I have tested more than a half dozen. none was proved to work, neither on a wordpress test site nor on a laravel project that I'm working on. they instead work on a plain html page. what is it that I'm doing wrong? thank you for your assistance.</p>
