<p>I have a data frame which looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>data.frame(puts = c("Put Daimler N JUN13 EUR 50 (24.06.2013)",   "Put Daimler N SEP12 EUR 40.5 (24.09.2012)",   "Put Wincor Nixdorf OCT14 CHF 43.80 (20.10.2")) </code></pre>  <p>I need to extract the so called <em>strike prices</em> from each string. That means I need to separate the numbers that are following the EUR and CHF currency description. </p>  <p>Unfortunately, the only constant in each string is that the prices are following either the EUR or CHF characters. So my idea was to extract the first numeric value after either "EUR" or "CHF" appears, but I completely faild to produce any presentable result.</p>  <p>The resulting data frame should look like this:</p>  <pre><code>data.frame(puts = c("Put Daimler N JUN13 EUR 50 (24.06.2013)",   "Put Daimler N SEP12 EUR 40.5 (24.09.2012)",   "Put Wincor Nixdorf OCT14 EUR 43.80 (20.10.2"),   strike = c(50, 40.5, 43.80)) </code></pre>  <p>Thanks for your help!
