<p>Just started on K&amp;R and hit:</p>  <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; /* copy input to output; 1st version */ main() {     int c;     c = getchar();     while (c != EOF) {         putchar(c);         c = getchar();     } } </code></pre>  <p>And it just displays what I input, even if it's a string of text.</p>  <pre><code>cacti cacti stop repeating what i'm saying stop repeating what i'm saying </code></pre>  <p>Just like that.</p>  <p>What I don't get is why I can't just instantiate variable c with a string of text and print it the same way. (Ignoring the while loop for the sake the example) Like with:</p>  <pre><code>main() {     int c;      c = "cacti";     putchar(c); } </code></pre>  <p>Wherein the output is apparently just 'd'</p>
