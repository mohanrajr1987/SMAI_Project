<p>I am currently looking solution to remove quote from syslog. I'm running a Debian 6 server which receives log from many devices ex: juniper.These logs will be stored in /var/log/syslog file and later it will be parsed and stored to database. However some of the log strings contain quote (") or single quote (') character which confuses the parser (python regex) or mysql input string. </p>  <p>log example :</p>  <pre><code>Aug 18 11:05:56  DMZ-SRX240-4 mgd[41143]: UI_CMDLINE_READ_LINE: User 'admin', command 'show configuration | display set | match 172.30.1.10 ' </code></pre>  <p>the question: can i replace the quote character before processing to retrieve the data or store it into database?</p>  <p>thanks in advance</p>
