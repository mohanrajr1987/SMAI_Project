<p>I'm writing a parser and I need to take exactly one char from the input and then change the control flow based on the value of this char,I know that I can do something like this <code>input.next().charAt(0)</code>,but if I will do it not only this char but the whole next string will disappear from the scanner and this is not what I want,so is there a way to check the value of the next character without taking it out of the scanner?</p>
