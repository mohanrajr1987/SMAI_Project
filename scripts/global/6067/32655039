<p>Wrecking my head over this for days, i've tried quite a few solutions to this. Each method worked to some degree (searched here on stackoverflow), but each method failed to pick up most of the special characters.  (and i'm really not good with the ` '  " [ { characters for if checks)</p>  <p>Basically i want to detect if one of these characters is in the filename  ( &amp; ` ´  ' " ~ / | \ [ ] $ * ; ) if the user selects a file and i'll make an error dialogue and a exit 0 in the code. </p>  <p>I'm currently using this:</p>  <pre><code>STARTUPFILE="$(/usr/bin/osascript -e "tell application \"System Events\" to activate" -e "tell application \"System Events\" to set thefile to choose file with prompt \"choose file \"" -e "do shell script (\"echo \"&amp;(quoted form of POSIX path of thefile as Unicode text)&amp;\"\")")"   FILENAME=$(basename "$STARTUPFILE") # via osascript input dialogue  if [[ $FILENAME = *[( &amp; ` ´  ' " ~ / | \ [ ] $ * ; )]* ]]; then </code></pre>  <p>What's the best way to detect all of them short of only allowing a-Z &amp; 0-9?</p>
