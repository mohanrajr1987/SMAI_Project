<p>I'm trying to get a single character input from the user without the user having to press enter. I've tried this:</p>  <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;  int main() {     int input;      for (;;) {         input = getchar();         printf("%d\n", input);     } } </code></pre>  <p>But not only does the user need to press enter, it also registers two presses (the input character and the newline character) ie:</p>  <pre><code>$ ./tests a 97 10 c 99 10 </code></pre>  <p>Since I will always expect exactly one character input from the user, and want this character as either a <code>char</code> or an <code>int</code>, how can I get the character without waiting for a <code>\n</code>.</p>  <p>I also tried using <code>fgets</code>, but because I'm in a loop waiting for user input, that just continously executes the <code>printf</code> without blocking until input.</p>  <p>My expected output would be:</p>  <pre><code>a97 b98 ... </code></pre>  <p>NB: I'm currently on OSX but I'm happy with a solution that applies to either OSX or Linux.</p>
