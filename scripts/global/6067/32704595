<p>As you probably know, Intellij doesn't recognize all the different characters in the world. How would I configure Intellij IDEA so that it would not translate ยง into an unknown character box thing?</p>  <p>I have looked for a solution, but nothing has arisen. The reason I need that character is because the API I am using requires that character to do something with strings.</p>
