<p>I have looked really hard on this.  Integers seem easy, but this is what I have been trying to figure out in C# in visual studio.</p>  <p>I want to have a user input of a letter like "a" then the console writes "apple", b=bobby, c=charlie, etc.  and when they don't put a letter then it gives an error message like "no letters used".  I am not sure if I am suppose to convert the user input from a string with ToChar or what the best way to do this is.  I haven't gotten into arrays yet and haven't figured out the switch command with characters (instead of integers or strings).</p>  <p>This is how I was trying to do it:</p>  <p>Console.WriteLine("Enter a letter "); choice = Convert.ToChar(Console.ReadLine());</p>  <pre><code>        if (char choice = 'a'){             Console.WriteLine("apple");          }else if (char choice = 'b'{             Console.WriteLine("bobby");         }else if (char choice = 'b'{             Console.WriteLine("bobby");         }else (char choise=!IsLetter){             Console.WriteLine("No Letters entered"); </code></pre>
