<p>Following sed expression decodes HTML URL Encoding (exactly as required): sed 's/%/\x/g' HTML encoding reference can be found here: <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.asp</a></p>  <p>However, I can't get how it works. Regex seems to say: find "%" and replace it by "\x" in the string, but it does much more then that. Why does it do decoding here ?</p>  <pre><code>Example: $ echo "This%20%2C%20character%20is%20comma" | echo -e "$(sed 's/%/\\x/g')" This , character is comma </code></pre>
