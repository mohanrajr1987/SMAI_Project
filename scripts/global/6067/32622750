<p>I have the following Variable called Date in an excel file which I'm reading into SAS:</p>  <pre><code>Date May2005 June2005 July2005 .. July2015 </code></pre>  <p>Both the format and the informat are characters ($8)</p>  <p>I wanted to convert these into a SAS Date variable. How can I accomplish this task? </p>  <p>I thought about using substr to first create a month and year variable,  then use proc format to convert all the months to numeric (e.g 'jan' = 1).  The use the mdy date function to create a new date. But I wonder if there is a shorter way to accomplish this task? </p>
