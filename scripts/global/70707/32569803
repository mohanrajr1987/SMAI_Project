<p>I'm trying to create a custom designed share icon for Google Plus that sits in an app that will be inside an iframe. The share should allow for text and an image.</p>  <p>I <strong>cannot</strong> use meta tags as these would sit in the iFrames parent, of which already has it's own tags for it's own sharing utils.</p>  <p>Can this be done, and if so how?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>  <p>PS. Google plus documentation is so over complicated and sucks!</p>
