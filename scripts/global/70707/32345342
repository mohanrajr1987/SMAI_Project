<p>I am working on a app that uses google+ and facebook login as user authentication. <br><br> I want to introduce different roles of users (ex- admin,user,product owner etc.) <br> A "product owner" will be able to see/ modify a different set of features than a  "user" and so on. <br><br> Does google+/facebook sign-in support such role based user login or I will have to write my own sign up process?</p>
