<p>i hope Google remove this constraint of being ( that is buy ) in a specific Domain to be able to use function of googleplusDomain API, and make this API really public for the develloper as Facebook and tweeter did. Otherwise G+ would never grow as social, this is my point of view.   My question is for Googles' devellopers: in the future, any change about this could happen ?</p>  <p>THKS NN</p>
