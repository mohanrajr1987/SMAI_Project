<p>I am trying to integrate google+ login with my website using javascript sdk, Though I am able to validate the user I need to obtain an access token on successful signin which I pass to the server to obtain further information. I went through the documentation in google developer console in this link: <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/reference" rel="nofollow">https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/reference</a><a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/reference" rel="nofollow">enter link description here</a></p>  <p>in that is could see a method GoogleUser.getAuthResponse() whose response object must contain an access_token.</p>  <p>However in my response object I couldn't find the access_token , but all the remaining key were present. I am not sure if the documentation is outdated.</p>  <p>Please help with me a solution this problem.</p>
