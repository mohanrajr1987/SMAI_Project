<p>When I share a link via the share-link endpoint <a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=_link-url_" rel="nofollow">https://plus.google.com/share?url=<em>link-url</em></a> (as described <a href="https://developers.google.com/+/web/share/?hl=en#sharelink-endpoint" rel="nofollow">here</a>) and then request the activities of the account I shared with using the Google Plus API, the resulting activity does not show (even though it was created and exists on the activity-feed)</p>  <p>Neither <code>activities.list</code> nor <code>activities.search</code> shows the post.</p>  <p>Is this intended behaviour/ are these shared links filtered?</p>
