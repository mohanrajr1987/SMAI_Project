<p>This question might be very trivial but this is giving me headache since past 6 hours. I have integrated google sign in SDK for iOS in my project and everything seems to be working fine except for the cancel button. <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/dQ3yq.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/dQ3yq.png" alt="enter image description here"></a>.</p>  <p>This screen comes up when i click on the google button in my login screen. But there is no way to dismiss this if the user decides to cancel google login. Typically the cancel button should come in the place of left bar button item but in this case  it is missing. </p>  <p>What am i doing wrong here??</p>
