<p>Like how I tried to effectively word in the title, my issue with Sign-ups and log-ins for my application is that it would work best with a college email, as it's an app designed for college campuses, but I can only find APIs and information regarding the Google+ sign-up that is everywhere. </p>  <p>For instance, an app like Kik does not require a Google+ sign-in and you can make your account however you like, but I've not found any information on how to go about creating a sign-in like that. The only substantial information regarding sign-ups/log-ins I've found are for the Google+ API.</p>  <p>The only other thing i thought of was using the Google+ sign-in to verify the person, and then having something in the settings to enter and save the college email for the uses it'll have.</p>  <p>Would any of you have thoughts on this? I'd prefer not to do the latter simply because it requires more for set-up of the app on the users part (which isn't ideal) to use it's full functionality, but I don't really see any other way of doing it at this point.</p>
