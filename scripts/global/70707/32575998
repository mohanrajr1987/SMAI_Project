<p>I'm using the C++ Api of Google Play Games Services for a cross-platform app.</p>  <p>After playing a match against a random player in Google Play Games Services, one can fetch this player via this function:</p>  <pre><code>void FetchRecentlyPlayed(DataSource data_source, FetchListCallback callback); </code></pre>  <p>How can I add a player from there as a permanent friend, so my users can later invite these players?</p>
