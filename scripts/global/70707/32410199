<p>I need to extract the category of a business. I already have the business ID on google+, but I haven't been able to find a method to get the category. Note that Google Places API has a very <a href="https://developers.google.com/places/supported_types" rel="nofollow">general categorization</a>, but I'm in search of the more <a href="https://plus.google.com/+CARPETCLEANERSGEELONGOceanGrove/about?hl=en-US" rel="nofollow">detailed one</a>. Is there a way to get that from any google API?</p>
