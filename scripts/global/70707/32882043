<p>We have an app that uses Google+ sign in (version 1.7.1)</p>  <p>We are upgrading to iOS 9 and face some issues. Looking in google docs we can not find any explicit reference to those issues + we see that the library was not updated lately.</p>  <ul> <li>Did google stopped supporting Google+ sign in ?</li> <li>Is there a valid way to support Google+ sign in iOS 9.0 or should we move to Google sign in?</li> </ul>  <p>The main problem is that we can not find any official reference for this issue.</p>  <p>(We did found this - <a href="https://code.google.com/p/google-plus-platform/issues/detail?id=1220" rel="nofollow">https://code.google.com/p/google-plus-platform/issues/detail?id=1220</a>) but no official answer.</p>  <p>Thaks</p>
