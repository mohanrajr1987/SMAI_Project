<p>Hello I am using google api to sign in to my web application . Now Its working fine . But the problem is the sigin is initiated automatically as I go to my log in page . But I do not want that . I want the user to click the signin button first then the  process will start .</p>  <p>I am using below button </p>  <pre><code>&lt;div class="g-signin2" data-onsuccess="onSignIn"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>and  <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in" rel="nofollow">google log in</a> references .  </p>
