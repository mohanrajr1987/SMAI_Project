<p>I have to share some text and a link from android application for that I have wrote code as follows</p>  <pre><code>        PlusShare.Builder shareBuilder = new PlusShare.Builder(this);         shareBuilder.setType("text/plain");         shareBuilder.setText("text to be shared");         shareBuilder.setContentUrl(Uri.parse("link_to_share"));         Intent shareIntent = shareBuilder.getIntent();         startActivityForResult(shareIntent, SHARE_GOOGLE_PLUS_REQUEST_CODE); </code></pre>  <p>this code works fine and I can share to google plus, and am getting a call back in onActivityResult(). what my issue is if the user not installed google plus, the app stop responds and exits. how do I fix this</p>
