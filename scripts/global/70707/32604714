<p>I have integrated Google Plus SDK for ios and setup everything for share. But is there a callback after the share display popup is opened AND THEN user shares or cancels the share. I want to know the delegate method where it says this. I know that <code>-(void)finishedSharingWithError:(NSError *)error</code> is the delegate method but its not being called. Here is my code for sharing via google plus..</p>  <pre><code>  -(void)postToGooglePlus:(PostModel *)parameter{  GPPSignIn *signIn = [GPPSignIn sharedInstance]; signIn.shouldFetchGooglePlusUser = YES; signIn.clientID = kClientId; signIn.scopes = @[ kGTLAuthScopePlusLogin ]; signIn.delegate = self; [signIn authenticate]; }   - (void)finishedWithAuth: (GTMOAuth2Authentication *)auth                error: (NSError *) error { NSLog(@"Received error %@ and auth object %@",error, auth);   id&lt;GPPNativeShareBuilder&gt; shareBuilder = [[GPPShare sharedInstance] nativeShareDialog];  [shareBuilder setPrefillText:@"This is a test"]; [shareBuilder open];  }  -(void)finishedSharingWithError:(NSError *)error{     if(!error){    }  } </code></pre>
