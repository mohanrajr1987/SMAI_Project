<p>I have successfully integrated Google+ api on my Android app, but I still can't figure out how to save my user in-app activity, like the user test scores, user high scores. and tgung of that type. I know how to get their data like profile picture and other. All I need is how to save their activity in my app. Will I need some database or something.  I hope someone can help</p>
