<p>I've used <a href="http://hybridauth.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">HybridAuth</a> to establish a single sign on on a website. This plugin uses server side authentication method to Google+ amongst others.</p>  <p>Downside of authenticating with Google+ is that users need to create a Google+ account first. On this site "<a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/quick-migration-guide" rel="nofollow">Google Sign-In for Websites</a>" it seems that a SSO can also be established using the 'main'-google account. </p>  <p>What if I would implement this 'main'-google account SSO? Would that mean that current authenticated users need to log in again? Does this have any advantage over using Google+?</p>
