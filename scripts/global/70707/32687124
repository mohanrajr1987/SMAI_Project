<p>I have my iOS app set up to allow users to sign in with Google Plus. Here is how I do that:</p>  <pre><code>GIDSignIn *signIn = [GIDSignIn sharedInstance]; signIn.shouldFetchBasicProfile = YES; signIn.delegate = self; signIn.uiDelegate = self; </code></pre>  <p>Then, when they want to sign out, I call this:</p>  <pre><code>[[GIDSignIn sharedInstance] signOut]; </code></pre>  <p>However, when they open the app again, I call a function to sign them in silently (if they are already signed in):</p>  <pre><code>[[GIDSignIn sharedInstance] signInSilently]; </code></pre>  <p>and this signs them in silently even after they signed out.</p>  <p>So, what's happening is...</p>  <pre><code>1. User signs in 2. User signs out 3. User resets app 4. User is silently signed in </code></pre>  <p>I wouldn't expect them to be silently signed in if they logged out. Is there something I am doing wrong? Thanks!</p>
