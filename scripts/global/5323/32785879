<p>Issue:</p>  <ul> <li>Loading a code-file from the harddrive into a text-widget created by tkinter (may be larger than xxx lines)</li> <li>Finding a position within this text-widget (line/column)</li> <li>Scrolling the text-widget to that exact position</li> </ul>  <p>So far I could not find any way to scroll to a specific line in a Tkinter text-widget. Since Tkinter always uses the line/column (e.g. "1.0") notation to identify positions in the text-widget, isn't there a way to directly scroll to a given position?</p>  <p>So far I tried setting the yview directly:</p>  <pre><code>textWidget.yview("scroll", scrollamount, "units") </code></pre>  <p>But that seems very unclean to me to use the "units" here...</p>  <p>Looking for a clean solution. Thanks.</p>
