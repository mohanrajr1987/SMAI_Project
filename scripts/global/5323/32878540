<p>I read related posts but they didn't satisfy me.</p>  <p>Using tkinter i coded a class Musicsheet. Then I wrote classes of notes like wholeNote &amp; halfNote, etc. After instantiaing MusicSheet followed by an instance of WholeNote, it looked ok, with the whole note on the music sheet. However, when I instantiated a half note the whole note had disappeared with just the half note on the sheet;it looks like halfNote had also instantiated ( sub classed?) a new music sheet thus previous notes/objects aren't there. This result in that the latest instance is always the only one on the sheet.</p>  <p>Thanks for the replies. Here are additional info:</p>  <pre><code> class Musicsheet(Frame):     .......TCanvas initialization..  class WholeNote(MusicSheet):    ......  class HalfNote(MusicSheet):    def __init__(self,x1,y1,x2,y2)    self.can.create_oval(x1,y1,x2,y2)    .....   more notes classes follow </code></pre>
