<p>The type field is the most important part of an event specifier. It specifies the kind of event that we wish to bind, and can be user actions like Button, and Key, or window manager events like Enter, Configure, and others. The modifier and detail fields are used to give additional information, and can in many cases be left out. There are also various ways to simplify the event string; for example, to match a keyboard key, you can leave out the angle brackets and just use the key as is. Unless it is a space or an angle bracket, of course.</p>
