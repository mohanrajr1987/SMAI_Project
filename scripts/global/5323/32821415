<p>I'm creating a simple text editor in Python 3.4 and Tkinter. At the moment I'm stuck on the <code>find</code> feature.</p>  <p>I can find characters successfully but I'm not sure how to highlight them. I've tried the tag method without success, error: </p>  <pre><code>str object has no attribute 'tag_add'.  </code></pre>  <p>Here's my code for the find function:</p>  <pre><code>def find(): # is called when the user clicks a menu item     findin = tksd.askstring('Find', 'String to find:')     contentsfind = editArea.get(1.0, 'end-1c') # editArea is a scrolledtext area     findcount = 0     for x in contentsfind:         if x == findin:             findcount += 1             print('find - found ' + str(findcount) + ' of ' + findin)     if findcount == 0:         nonefound = ('No matches for ' + findin)         tkmb.showinfo('No matches found', nonefound)         print('find - found 0 of ' + findin) </code></pre>  <p>The user inputs text into a scrolledtext field, and I want to highlight the matching strings on that scrolledtext area. </p>  <p>How would I go about doing this?</p>
