<p>I have a GUI that features 12 TK text widgets, one box for each team, each widget containing the list of players within the team, when the program starts each team is empty. </p>  <p>The user will select a player for team one, then team two, etc.  I need a method of preventing the user from adding a second player to team one before they have chosen a player for each other team. It doesn't matter what order the teams players are chosen in, just that each team must have an equal amount of players in it before the user can proceed to the next round of picking players. </p>  <p>I'm really struggling to come up with a method of doing this, any advice would be greatly appreciated.  I'm fairly new here so if this isn't the sort of question this site is for, or if I've used inappropriate tags, I apologise. </p>
