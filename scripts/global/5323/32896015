<p>I am trying start learning Tkinter to make a small gui application, however every time I do <code>import tkinter</code> all the print statements are duplicated. The problem exists with the absolute simplest script.</p>  <p>I am running windows 8.1 and python 3.5, and I am writing and building the application in Sublime Text 3 with a customized build system.</p>  <p>It is however unlikely that ST3 has anything to do with it since the problem also exists when running the script from the command line <code>py -3 tkinter.py</code></p>  <p>Here is an example of my problem. This is all of the code.</p>  <pre><code>import tkinter print("Hello") </code></pre>  <p>Always outputs </p>  <pre><code>Hello Hello </code></pre>  <p>But code consisting of just <code>print("Hello")</code> outputs, as expected</p>  <pre><code>Hello </code></pre>  <p>I am truly lost with this problem and it would be of great help if any of you could point me to the right direction</p>
