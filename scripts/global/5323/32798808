<p>I have a calculator program with a tkinter created GUI. I want to package this into a single GUI but using</p>  <pre><code>py -3.4 -m py2exe.build_exe calc_gui.pyw -p tkinter -b 0 </code></pre>  <p>in the command prompt, I get get the error message:</p>  <pre><code>The following modules require a minimum of bundle_files option,  otherwise they will not work (currently bundle_files is set to 0):          tkinter: 2  Please change the bundle_files option and run the build again. Build failed </code></pre>  <p>I was wondering if there was a way I could package this into a single .exe using py2exe as using -b 2 or 3 works fine but they don't produce standalone .exe's</p>  <p>BTW, this is in Python 3 (which is supported by py2exe)</p>
