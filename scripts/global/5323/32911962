<p>Building a word processes in Tkinter, and I want to center the title that the user inputs. But I am having trouble when getting the title from an Entry box, and spacing it halfway through the page.</p>  <p>The following code uses the input (pnames), and then takes its length and converts it to float (pname_parse).</p>  <p>From there the program divides the length of the title in half. Then it takes half of the width of the Text box (64 characters). Then it subtracts pname_parse2 from 64 and mutiplies the number of spaces by pname_parse3 (final number). </p>  <p>This should center my title when I insert the spaces and the title after it.</p>  <p>Except I am getting this error:</p>  <pre><code>TypeError: can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'float' on line </code></pre>  <p>On the line that determines pname_parse3. Why can't I multiply the number by the space. I have converted the number to float, and the same basic principle works when I multiply "\n"*4.</p>  <pre><code>pname_parse = float(len(pnames)) pname_parse1 = (pname_parse/2) pname_parse2 = (64 - pname_parse1) pname_parse3 = (" "*pname_parse2) </code></pre>
