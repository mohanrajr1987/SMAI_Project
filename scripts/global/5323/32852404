<p>So.....</p>  <p>I want my program to launch a Tkinter GUI Window, which gives the user text boxes to enter values as strings or as integers..... The code below does that</p>  <pre><code>    from Tkinter import *       def add_text():        label1 = Label(root, text="You have entered the information to the average speed checker")        label1.pack()      root = Tk()     root.title("Average Speed Checker")     root.geometry("450x165")      veh_reg_label = Label(root, text="Vehicle Registration:")     veh_reg_label.pack()      veh_reg_text_box = Entry(root, bd=1)     veh_reg_text_box.pack()      distance_label = Label(root, text="Distance")     distance_label.pack()      distance_text_box = Entry(root, bd=1)     distance_text_box.pack()      time_label = Label(root, text="Time")     time_label.pack()      time_text_box = Entry(root, bd=1)     time_text_box.pack()      enter_button = Button(root, text="Enter", command=add_text)     enter_button.pack()      root.mainloop() </code></pre>  <p>However..... There is one problem: I can't seem to find a (simple  ;) ) way of storing this text entry as a variable, which means that I am not able to continue with my program by making it calculate if a car is over a certain speed when travelling a distance of road etc etc.....</p>  <p>If anyone could help me, I would be very grateful!</p>  <p>Thanks!    Python 2.7.8</p>
