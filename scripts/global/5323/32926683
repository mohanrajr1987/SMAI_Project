<p>I've got a button that I'd like to be able to click and have a toplevel window appear to say 'Processing..' while the rest of the function runs.</p>  <p>Not sure why, but the toplevel window only appears AFTER the rest of the function has done its thing.</p>  <p>I've tried messing around with time.sleep() and such, but no dice.</p>  <pre><code>class newFrame():      def __init__(self, master):          frame_main = Frame(master)         frame_main.grid(row=1, columnspan=2)          self.scan_button = Button(master, text="Scan", command=MasterScan)         self.scan_button.grid(row=5,column=1))  def MasterScan():      top = Toplevel()     msg = Label(top, text="Processing...")     msg.pack()      button = Button(top, text="Cancel", command=top.destroy)     button.pack()      #Rest of the function starts here - web scraping stuff </code></pre>  <p>Any help would be much appreciated!</p>  <p>Cheers</p>
