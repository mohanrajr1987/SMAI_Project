<p>I am trying to make my matrix (tc) symmetric (using R) by adding the corresponding entries and divide those by the sum of the corresponding diagonal entries (tc[i,j]+tc[j,i])/(tc[i,i]+tc[j,j]). I tried it with loops but it does not give me the right values let alone make the matrix symmetric. This is my code so far:</p>  <pre><code>    for (i in 1:end){       for(j in 1:end){         tc[i,j]&lt;-(tc[i,j]+tc[j,i])/(tc[i,i]+tc[j,j])       }     } </code></pre>  <p>It's probably a super obvious mistake but I can't figure it out. Can anyone help me? =)</p>
