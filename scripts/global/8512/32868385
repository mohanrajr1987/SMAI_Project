<p>I have a numpy matrix that I want to fill with the results of a function. This function returns a map of integer values that will be maped into a row of the matrix.</p>  <p>The values returned by the function are like:</p>  <pre><code>{1:6, 2:3, 3:2, 4:2, 5:1} </code></pre>  <p>Then, I wrote the following code to fill in the values into the matrix:</p>  <pre><code>results = np.empty((10, 5), dtype=int)  for i in range(10):     result = method()     for j in range(5):         results[i, j] = result[j] </code></pre>  <p>I want to know if there is a more properly/efficient way to do this with python?</p>
