<pre><code>julia&gt; A = [1 2; 3 4] 2x2 Array{Int64,2}:  1  2  3  4  julia&gt; A * inv(A) 2x2 Array{Float64,2}:  1.0          0.0  8.88178e-16  1.0 </code></pre>  <p>Why is the result in the lower left corner <code>8.88178e-16</code> rather than <code>0.0</code> like in the upper right? How can I perform the operation so that I get <code>[1.0 0.0; 0.0 1.0]</code> as the result.</p>  <p>Is there a way to display the result as desired, but actually perform the matrix operation symbolically as one would be able to in muPad or some other symbolic evaluator?</p>
