<p>Assume I have three matrices...</p>  <pre><code>A=matrix(c("a",1,2),nrow=1,ncol=3) B=matrix(c("b","c",3,4,5,6),nrow=2,ncol=3) C=matrix(c("d","e","f",7,8,9,10,11,12),nrow=3,ncol=3) </code></pre>  <p>I want to find all possible combinations of column 1 (characters or names) while summing up columns 2 and 3. The result would be a single matrix with length equal to the total number of possible combinations, in this case 6. The result would look like the following matrix...</p>  <pre><code>Result &lt;- matrix(c("abd","abe","abf","acd","ace","acf",11,12,13,12,13,14,17,18,19,18,19,20),nrow=6,ncol=3) </code></pre>  <p>I do not know how to add a table in to this question, otherwise I would show it more descriptively. Thank you in advance. </p>
