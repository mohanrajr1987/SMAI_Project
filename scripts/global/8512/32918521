<p>I'm having trouble with splitting up a vector into a 2D matrix or a given side. For example, given the vector {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12}, the rows (3), and columns (4) can be turned into {{1, 2, 3, 4}, {5, 6, 7, 8}, {9, 10, 11, 12}}.</p>  <p>As of right now, the code just prints out the entire vector in a an array for however many rows their are.</p>  <pre><code>int[][] reshape(int[] vector, int row, int col) {         if (!isReshapable(vector.length, row, col)) {             return null;         } else {             int[][] matrix = new int[row][col];             for (int i = 0; i &lt; row; i++) {                 for (int j = 0; j &lt; col; j++) {                     Arrays.fill(matrix, vector);                 }             }             return matrix;         }     }     </code></pre>
