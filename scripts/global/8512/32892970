<p>N* [1]| [2] | [3]<br> 1* | <strong>3</strong> | <strong>20</strong> |  3 |<br> 2* | 2 | 10 |  3 |<br> 3* | <strong>3</strong> | <strong>25</strong> |  3 |<br> 4* | 1 | 15 |  3 |<br> 5* | <strong>3</strong> | <strong>30</strong> |  3 |  </p>  <p>Can you help me to get a sum of second column, but only sum of elements that has 3 in the first row. For example in that matrix it is 20+25+30=75. In a fastest way (it's actually big matrix).</p>  <p>P.S. I tried something like this with(Train, sum(Column2[,"Date"] == i)) As you can see I need sum Of Colomn2 where date has certain meaning (from 1 to 12)</p>
