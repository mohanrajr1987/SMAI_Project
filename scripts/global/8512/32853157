<p>I have a square matrix of indeterminate row &amp; column length (assume rows and columns are equal as befits a square).</p>  <p>I've plotted out an example matrix as follows:</p>  <pre><code>matrix = [   [1, 2, 3],   [4, 5, 6],   [7, 8, 9]  ] </code></pre>  <p>My goal is to get a sum from top-left to bottom-right of the diagonal values.</p>  <p>Obviously in this example, this is all i'll need:</p>  <pre><code>diagsum = matrix[0][0]+matrix[1][1]+matrix[2][2] #=&gt;  15 </code></pre>  <p>I see the pattern where it's a +1 incremental for each row &amp; column argument in the matrix, so the code i've developed for my matrix of indeterminate length (supplied as the argument to my method <code>diagsum</code> would preferably need to implement some sort of row_count method on my matrix argument.</p>
