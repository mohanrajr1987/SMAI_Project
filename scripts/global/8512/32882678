<p>I have 2 sequences in a cell-array  : </p>  <pre><code> Input_cell= {'ABC','ACB'}  S1= 'ABC' % which means A&lt;B&lt;C  S2= 'ACB' % which means A&lt;C&lt;B </code></pre>  <p>I want to convert each of the strings in the <code>Input_cell</code> into a matrix <code>M[i,j]</code> which has to satisfy those conditions :</p>  <pre><code>       M[i,j] , M[j,i] are random        M[i,i] =0.5        M[i,j] + M[j,i] = 1        M[i,j] &lt; M[j,i] % For example: if A&lt;B then M[A,B] &lt; M[B,A]   %// For example: if we have S1 = 'ABC'  (which means `A&lt;B&lt;C`), the M1 matrix will  be expected as follows:       A      B    C       A  0.5    0    0      B  1     0.5   0     C  1      1   0.5      %// If we have S2 = 'ACB' (which means `A&lt;C&lt;B`), the M2 matrix will be expected as follows:      A      B    C       A  0.5    0    0      B  1     0.5   1     C  1      0   0.5    </code></pre>  <p>How to create that kind of above matrices from a given cell-array of sequences?</p>
