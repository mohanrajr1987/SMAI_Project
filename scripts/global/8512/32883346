<p>I have been trying to solve a system of equations without succeeding for the last couple of days. I tried the "linsove" function and the "solve" function and alway truns out there is no solution/ Warning: The system is inconsistent. Solution does not exist; which is pretty strange since I solved it manually for 4 equations.</p>  <p>Below one of my attempts:</p>  <p>syms A B C D V w x y z %% unknowns are w x y z. A B C D are values I will insert after measurments.</p>  <pre><code>eqn1 = A*(x+w) == V;   eqn2 = B*(y+z) == V;   eqn3 = C*(w+y) == V;  eqn4 = D*(z+x) == V;   [A,B] = equationsToMatrix([eqn1,eqn2,eqn3,eqn4],[w,x,y,z]);  X = linsolve(A,B) </code></pre>  <p>The following error comes</p>  <p>Warning: The system is inconsistent. Solution does not exist;</p>  <p>As I said, I solved them manually twice. A solution does exist.</p>  <p>Thank you for your help.</p>
