<p>so a small version of what I am trying to accomplish is I have a matrix A;</p>  <pre><code>A = [0 1 0; 2 0 0;1 3 6;9 0 1]; imagesc(A) </code></pre>  <p>So when I use imagesc(A) I get a nice grid with each value represented by a different color. However I want to be able to set the value of 0 specifically to white and ideally be able to change the other colors as I see fit such as if I know two values represent the same thing like 3 and 6, then they could be set to the same or relatively similar colors. Is imagesc the wrong command to use because from what I can tell it uses a color gradient.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
