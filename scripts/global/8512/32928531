<p>I have a distance matrix in numpy. I calculated that as dist=1-cosinesimilarity(X). </p>  <p>So I have a matrix X of n-samples,n_features. I calculated the cosine similarity of the matrix. And then 1-cosinesimilarity gave me a measure of distance between the vectors. </p>  <p>Now I want to use this distance matrix and convert it into an affinity matrix using rbf gaussian kernel. </p>  <p>The problem is rbf kernel would require sigma^2: </p>  <p>k(x, y) = \exp( -\gamma \| x-y \|^2)</p>  <p>where gamma =-1/sigma^2. </p>  <p>I don't want to use the same original X and calculate rbf on that.My code has already calculated distance matrix. Is there a way I can use the same distance matrix and get affinity matrix using RBF kernel?. </p>
