<p>I have 29 matrix. I need to write 29 nested loops and in the last loop I should call a function on the 29-word string. But writing 29 loops is time consuming. Also, I have to repeat this procedure in another <code>R</code> code. I'm looking for an alternative way to implement these loops. The code for what I explained is as follows. <code>m1</code> to <code>m29</code> are matrix and <code>make_rule_antc</code> is the function that I call on each element of the matrix:</p>  <pre><code>    for (i1 in 1:nrow(m1)){        for (i2 in 1:nrow(m2)){         for (i3 in 1:nrow(m3)){           .           .            .           for (i29 in 1:nrow(m29)){               make_rule_antc(m1[i1,],m2[i2,],m3[i3,],...,m29[i29,])           }        }      }     } </code></pre>
