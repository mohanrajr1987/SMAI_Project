<p>I need to join a group of matrices and store this union in other one.  I think that it can be possible with a for loop but i have a lot of data in the matrices and that could involve many calculations. How can I do this?  <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/HzEL2.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/HzEL2.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Thank you very much</p>
