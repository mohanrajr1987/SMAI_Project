<p>In <code>MATLAB</code>, I am trying to get the relative difference between two curves but I couldn't. I am interested in the differences in the y-axis in the common range of x-axis. The problem that I am facing is that one of the curves has 29 points and the other has 60 points as shown in the attached plot. Is there way to get the difference between these two plots ?<a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/9vqUX.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/9vqUX.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
