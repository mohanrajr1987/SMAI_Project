<p>I am trying to multiply two large matrices and find indexes of biggest 20 or so elements for each row of resulting fairly large (50000x50000) matrix. I hope to use Spark with java for this. I found I can multiply distributed matrices if I store them as BlockMatrices. But otherwise there do not seem to be any more complex operations available for distributed matrices and I am stuck. What would be the best way to do such operation? Simple code I have so far looks something like this:</p>  <pre><code>JavaSparkContext sc = new JavaSparkContext(conf); BlockMatrix A = getBlockMatrixA(sc); BlockMatrix B = getBlockMatrixB(sc); BlockMatrix AB = A.multiply(B); </code></pre>
