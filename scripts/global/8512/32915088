<p>I need to handle data in a matrix. I want to have something like this:</p>  <pre><code>{{"data11", "data12", "data13"}, {"data21", "data22", "data23"}, {"data31", "data32", "data33"}} </code></pre>  <p>I think that "<code>char* matrix[3][3];</code>" could do the trick, but I haven't gotten the expected result.</p>  <p>I need to do the following actions:</p>  <ol> <li>Initialize the matrix empty (with empty Strings or something like <code>""</code>).</li> <li>Put data in the matrix dynamically.</li> </ol>  <p>thanks in advance.</p>
