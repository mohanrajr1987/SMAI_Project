<p><a href="http://imgur.com/9GmKox4" rel="nofollow">Given the following Problem</a>: How can I achieve this? I am trying to shift the columns to the right, but I can only get them to shift to the left. I also cannot account for the column on the end being shifted to the front. I know I need to use some kind of temporary array, but I don't know how to implement it.</p>  <p>My code so far:</p>  <pre><code>function [B] = column_shift()  A = input('Enter an nx6 matrix: ') interimA = A(:,6);     for n = 1:5         A(:,n) = A(:,n+1);         interimA = A(:,1);      end B = A end </code></pre>
