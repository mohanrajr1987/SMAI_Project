<p>I am looking to find 'half' of an affine transformation matrix using MATLAB. Yes I understand, 'half' a matrix isn't really correct, but exactly what I'm looking for was actually explained very well here: <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/611359/affine-transformation-matrix-coefficients">stackexchange mathematics</a></p>  <p>So I'm looking for an affine transformation matrix (B) which when applied twice to my image, will give the same result as when applying my initial matrix (A) once.</p>  <p>Reflection will not be part of A, otherwise it would be impossible to find B.</p>  <p>My initial matrix (A) is calculated using <code>A = estimateGeometricTransform(movingPoints,fixedPoints,'affine')</code>, which gives me an affine2d object.</p>  <p>If there is no way to find the 'half' matrix from the initial matrix, maybe the arrays of matched points can be manipulated in a way to find B from them.</p>  <p>Cheers</p>
