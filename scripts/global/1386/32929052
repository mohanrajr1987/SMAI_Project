<p>I want to develop my own lockscreen for my phone, I have some knowledge with app development but I just want to ask what is the best way to accomplish it, I don't have any code currently.</p>  <p>My thinking: Creating an app running in baackground with a reciever for pressing the lockbutton, then use intent to a screen(and also disabling original lockscreen), then in this screen do everything. </p>  <p>But this is another thing running in background and consuming battery, is there a better way?</p>
