<p>I'm developing an android application which requires to have 2 video recordings at the same time. I have my first MediaRecorder object starts a recording at 0 seconds. Then, I want my second MediaRecorder object to starts recording at 18 seconds. Finally, the first recorder will stop at the 20th seconds. Between 18 and 20 seconds, I will have 2 recoding instances. </p>  <p>However, the app crashes upon the start method (recorder.start()) execution of the second MediaRecorder object. I have been trying the find a work around for 2 days. </p>  <p>Any help will be greatly appreciated. Thanks </p>
