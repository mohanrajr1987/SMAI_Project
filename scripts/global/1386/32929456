<p>I have an app that creates a PDF file, and save it in the Internal Storage by now, I need to let the User choose where to save the file, in the Internal, External (SDCard) or USB Storage (The device supports USB OTG)</p>  <p>I see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31626095/android-using-usb-as-storage-to-save-photos">HERE</a> that it might be problems with KK or LP, is there any way to avoid this problems? maybe with permissions or root?</p>  <p>I see in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21452220/external-usb-storage-on-android">HERE</a> some ways to display the Storages with some kind of VFAT property or something, but I don't understand that.</p>  <p>There is no need to choose the exact folder to save the file, but i need the User can choose between the storage devices and make USB storage works.</p>  <p>Any Idea?</p>
