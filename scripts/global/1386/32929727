<p>I have <strong>Takee 1</strong> 5.5 inch tablet and I tried to use google cardboard. Everything was fine but When I turn my face to left the scene turn to right and when I look up the scene goes down and so on ...  in other words the directions are inverted ! I think that is because when mobile goes to landscape mode , the parameters of sensors are inverted.</p>
