<p>To snapshot a view in Android, we could use the way in the thread of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9791714/take-a-screenshot-of-a-whole-view">Take a screenshot of a whole View</a>. I'm seeking a new way with better performance to do that.</p>  <p>Two additional questions: 1. is it possible to snapshot without showing that  view? 2. is there a good-performance way to do: snapshot and scale down?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
