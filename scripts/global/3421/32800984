<p><strong>Some background:</strong></p>  <p>The R language community has a big packages repository called <em>CRAN</em>.  With the <a href="https://github.com/eddelbuettel/drat" rel="nofollow"><strong><em>drat</em></strong> package</a> it is easy to host private CRAN-like repositories. There are many organizations which hosts their R packages using the <strong><em>drat</em></strong> package and a <code>gh-pages</code> branch. <strong><em>Drat</em></strong> simply creates a directory structure which is recognized by the R command <code>install.packages()</code>. There is no <code>index.html</code> file in the repository structure.  </p>  <p><strong>My question is then:</strong></p>  <p>How can one gather per-file download statistics from these <code>gh-pages</code>?  I've found the "<a href="https://www.stackoverflow.com/questions/17207458/how-to-add-google-analytics-tracking-id-to-github-pages">How to add Google Analytics Tracking ID to GitHub Pages</a>" question but it requires an <code>index.html</code>, so it cannot be used here.</p>  <p>Any suggestions how to solve this?</p>  <p>Is this supported by GitHub at all?</p>
