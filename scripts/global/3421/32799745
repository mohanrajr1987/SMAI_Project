<p>I have a cordova app that has a cookie (from Google Analytics) and the users who install it in the EU region (e.g. Germany, London etc.) should receive a notification that a cookie is being used.  I understand that a cookie can not be used in a Cordova app <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15349237/handling-cookies-in-phonegap-cordova">from here</a>. But the assumption in my app is that the GA cookie is dropped when the app opens a particular page (path of this page is fetched from my backend as a JSON). How do we handle this scenario - to show an alert/notification in my app that a cookie is being used? Is this achievable at all? Please help. <a href="http://www.bobmartin.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">Example of a website where cookie usage notification is shown on the bottom of the page</a>.</p>
