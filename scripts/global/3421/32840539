<p>In a recent Q&amp;A on Youtube, the GTM product manager said two things which made me consider the current recommendation of putting the GTM script at the beginning of the body tag.</p>  <p><a href="https://youtu.be/XBCNJo9qGH8?t=6m23s" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/XBCNJo9qGH8?t=6m23s</a> </p>  <p>The video highlights the positives of having it early, and that the drawbacks are HTML validation.  Synchronous tags will be supported by the end of the year, and I hope to future-proof with that in mind (for synchronous A/B scripts)</p>  <p>It seems desirable to be able to deploy A/B snippets from Google Analytics and optimizely through GTM.(it´s very desirable because I don´t want a synchronous script being there for several months).</p>  <p>What are other negative consequences of putting the script in the head section?</p>
