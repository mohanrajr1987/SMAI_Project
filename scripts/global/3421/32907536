<p>we need to submit data to google from our website and online app. For that reason we generated uuid on our website and use it in our online desktop app. Everything is working correctly, we can see behaviour flow with all submitted events. </p>  <p>Problem is that since we did this change, it's not detecting correctly source channels. everything what should be in paid search goes to direct traffic.</p>  <p>original code was:</p>  <pre><code> ga('create', 'UA-XXXXXXX-1', 'auto');  ga('send', 'pageview'); </code></pre>  <p>current code:</p>  <pre><code> ga('create', 'UA-XXXXXXX-1', { 'clientId': $uuid });  ga('send', 'pageview'); </code></pre>  <p>Do we have to specify gclid id during Tracker initialization when it's presented to let google track it properly? Could it be something else?</p>
