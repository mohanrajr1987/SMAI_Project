<p>I am trying to implement the user id function in GA.</p>  <p>I have set up the dimensions as per instructions and the tags are firing but the user id is not showing up in analytics. I created a data layer as per instructions and tried some custom scripts to pull the data from the page. I feel like I am missing something.</p>  <p>The data on the page looks like this: </p>  <pre><code>getUserId:function(){return"660716"} </code></pre>  <p>Thanks!</p>
