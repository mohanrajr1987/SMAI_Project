<p>I have a small multitenant application and I want to use google analytics to track the different minitenants. Tutorials on this topic seem to be pretty scarce, but I was wondering how I would go about  1) Rendering the dashboard for each 'site' 2) Allowing the creation of new sites for google analytic 'sites' automatically. Using a 'global' Google account.</p>  <p>Any help would be very much appreciated.</p>
