<h2>Setup</h2>  <p>I have a Goal setup in Analytics, that has a required funnel YES with <code>'/'</code> as the first step in the required funnel ( My website )</p>  <h2>Questions:</h2>  <ol> <li><p>I have other items in the funnel, the Required YES button seems to be next to just the first step, does it mean the rest of the items in the funnel are also required?</p></li> <li><p>If I have <code>'/'</code> as the first step in my Required funnel, and I setup an experiment that uses, say index2.php. Will the goal still work although the step in my funnel is different? I.e. does the experiment look at the original index page not the variation in the experiment?</p></li> </ol>
