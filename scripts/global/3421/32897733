<p>I realized today that my Goal was set up for Exact Match of my Goal URL:</p>  <p>i.e. /purchase/thank-you.page</p>  <p>I set up the Goal URL to be Regular expression, as I looked into my Analytics and found that the actual URLs look something like:</p>  <p>/purchase/thank-you.page?purchaseID=xxxxxxx?transactionID=xxxx</p>  <p>Am I going to be safe just setting the URL goal type to Regular Expression and leaving the URL as: /purchase/thank-you.page?</p>  <p>Is that sufficient to capture everything?</p>
