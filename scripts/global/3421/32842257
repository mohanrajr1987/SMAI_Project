<p>So I’m following Google’s atrocious documentation for Google Tag Manager, investigating for my employer whether it’s “worth” switching from Google Analytics to using GTM. There’s a huge lack of clarity in the documentation of what the difference between the two is, but I’ve gleaned that GTM in fact seems to just give the marketing team a little more flexibility in the way they collate data on their end.</p>  <p>I’m struggling to understand exactly what benefits GTM has over a simple integration of GA (like we already have).</p>  <p>Secondly, and more technically, following through the examples with a completely fresh Google account, but nothing shows up in the real time view at all, no active users, nothing coming through. I’ve carbon-copied their example code, like so:</p>  <pre><code>[self.tagManager.dataLayer push:@ {     @"event"                  : @"openScreen",     @"screenName"             : screen }]; </code></pre>  <p>Has anyone done this? Do you need to do anything specific with it? Here’s what it looks like in GTM, I have no idea if it’s right:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/uBO8G.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/uBO8G.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
