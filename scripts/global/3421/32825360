<p>I've been reading up on how to return transaction information once a user checks out and reaches the confirmation page. For example, I would like to receive the <strong>time/date, order total, and product information</strong> along with the <strong>campaign</strong> info, using the user's cookies possibly to see what campaigns are being used and which ones aren't.</p>  <p>So far, I've found a couple methods that are close to what I want to do. But between all the different documentation and deprecated methods, I'm a little overwhelmed.</p>  <p>I think the best way for me to go about this is just grab a custom variable from the URL or from the cookie once the user reaches the confirmation page.</p>  <p>Is this so? And how do I actually go about this? Please, if you link to Google documentation, can you explain it in a simpler way for me? </p>
