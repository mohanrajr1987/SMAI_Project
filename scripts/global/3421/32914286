<p>I have a REST service implemented using django-rest-framework. What I would like to do is start recording Google Analytics data (events for starters) when particular requests are made. </p>  <p>I've done some looking around, I see there is a <a href="https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/apis/analytics/v3?hl=en" rel="nofollow">Google Analytics python library</a> , but from what I can see it's more for querying the API and not posting to it. I see there is a <a href="https://github.com/kra3/py-ga-mob/" rel="nofollow">py-ga</a> library but it hasn't been updated in awhile. Seems other libraries for django and analytics are meant to be used client side via JavaScript.</p>  <p>What would be a reasonable way to implement what I am looking for? Am I missing an official library somewhere? Anyone have any experience doing this? Any advice would be appreciated, thanks much!</p>
