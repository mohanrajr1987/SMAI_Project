<p>I've implemented GTM on an ecommerce site and have some tags set up for a few thins (page impressions, add to cart etc.) These all work and track in Analytics as expected however I've now added the checkout funnel pushes and these are firing but not tracking.</p>  <p>Data flow is basically: User Visits Cart Page >> Step 1 dataLayer.push request >> Console shows Checkout Tag has fired >> Data doesn't show up in analytics.</p>  <p>An example of this dataLayer push event is as follows:</p>  <pre><code>dataLayer.push({     'event' : 'checkout',     'ecommerce' : {         'currencyCode' : 'GBP',         'checkout' : {             'actionField' : {'step' : 1},             'products' : [             {                 'name' : '&amp;quot;Some product name&amp;quot;',                 'id' : '55',                 'price' : '35',                 'quantity' : '1'             }             ]         }     } }); </code></pre>
