<p>I have an extremely weird filter issue with Google Analytics and Shopify. </p>  <p>A view is setup that includes only the store's subdomain and its checkout based on the hostname filter field. I have tried these filter patterns: </p>  <pre><code>store\.domain\.com|.*shopify\.com store\.domain\.com|checkout\.shopify\.com ^(store\.domain\.com|checkout\.shopify\.com)$ </code></pre>  <p>The only pages included have a hostname of store.domain.com. No pages on shopify.com ever get included. It's only when the filter is removed altogether that page views on the shopify.com start appearing.</p>  <p>Here's where it gets weirder.</p>  <p>I have an unfiltered view setup where I run the exact filter patterns on the hostname as an advanced segment. Pages on the sub-domain checkout.shopify.com show for any of the filter patterns.</p>  <p>Secondly, I confirm the pages disappearing in the analytics reports have a hostname that is exactly:</p>  <pre><code>checkout.shopify.com </code></pre>  <p>Any further debugging ideas? Possible explanations?</p>
