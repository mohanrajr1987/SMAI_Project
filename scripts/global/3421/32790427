<p>Recently I have replaced my old website with a new one. On both of them I have Google Analytics attached. On the old site everything worked fine (the reports with ".html" at the end). The old site was based on static html pages. The new site is based on Wordpress with a theme with build in google analytics. Unfortunately the reports from the new page contain the domain name at the beginning, what makes them harder to read. How to get rid of this domain name to have "/kontakt/" instead of "/<a href="http://example.pl/kontakt/" rel="nofollow">http://example.pl/kontakt/</a>"?</p>  <p>Here is the code that is used by the theme for Google Analytics:</p>  <pre><code>var _gaq = _gaq || []; _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-12345678-9']); _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);  (function() { var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true; ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ? 'https://ssl' : 'http://www') + '.google-analytics.com/ga.js'; var s = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(ga, s);         })(); </code></pre>  <p>Here you can see what the problem is: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/aWAa2.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/aWAa2.png" alt="reports with added domain name"></a></p>
