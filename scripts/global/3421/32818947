<p>In the startup I'm currently working, we have developed a push server that enables the user to receive push notification when new content uploaded in our database.</p>  <p>Our system currently stores how many push are send and through Google analytics we can see how many people interact with the push notification, yet we would like to know how many people in total receive the push notification.</p>  <p>How can we count how many devices recevie the push? Which method could we use? As an example users unistall the app but we still have them stored on our database, or users may opt-out from the push through system settings (both ios and android)</p>  <p>Thanks for the help!</p>
