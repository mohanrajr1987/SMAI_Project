<p>In Google Analytics, I gather e-commerce data, allowing me to track purchases. There is a specific analysis, however, which I cannot imagine how to set up. I need to verify how big a percentage of a revenue is generated by transactions which include product X but not products Y and Z. I have attempted to set this up in a custom report, but cannot figure out exactly which combination of dimensions, metrics and filters to use. </p>
