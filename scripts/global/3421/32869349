<p>I'm trying to configure google analytics <code>GoogleService-info.plist</code> file from <a href="https://developers.google.com/mobile/add" rel="nofollow">google developers site</a>. Yesterday i configured one app and had no problem. but today i can not configure my second app to use google Analytics.  I Choose <strong>App Name</strong> and <strong>IOS Bundle Id</strong>. Then on next step, where it asks to choose service , i choose <strong>Analytics</strong> , but under <strong>Google Analytics Account</strong> there is no select box to choose account. how can i fix this?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/PPE1W.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/PPE1W.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
