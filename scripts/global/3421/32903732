<p>In my website I noticed a sudden downfall on some metrics. I track it with Google Analytics and Google Tag Manger and since I've made some changes in several tags, I decided to temporarly a secondary Google Analytics property, for debuggin purposes.</p>  <p>Well, the two has the same values, as expected) <strong>but</strong> different pageviews.</p>  <p>This is what my debug GA says: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/jkT8q.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/jkT8q.png" alt="my debug GA"></a></p>  <p>And this my original one: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/0nXft.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/0nXft.png" alt="my original GA"></a></p>  <p>Difference in Sessions are too small to be significant.</p>  <p>But not the same with Pageviews, in my opinion. Weird enough, further analysis shows that the difference is only in Pageviews and <strong>not</strong> in "Unique Pageviews" (they match perfectly).</p>  <p>This is really weird to me as the fact that unique pageviews match means the pageview event was fired, ence was not a problem with the GTM Tag.</p>  <p>Original/Debug are almost the same, after the forementioned exception rule (for logged users) and the allowLinker=False parameter (absent in Debug). Can those cause these discrepancies?</p>
