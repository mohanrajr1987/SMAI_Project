<p>I was just recently learn about Google Analytics, ecommerce, and enhanced commerce, to be implemented on a website. Actually, someone else already implemented the Google Analytics and ecommerce, and maybe also the enhanced ecommerce, so right now I tried to understand his code and implement the enhanced commerce if it hasn't been implemented.</p>  <p>Is that ecommerce object is starting with "ecommerce:" ? Like <code>ga('ecommerce:'...)</code> ? I noticed that the enhanced ecommerce has prefix of "ec:". Is "ecommerce:" and "ec:" interchangeable?</p>  <p>Btw, I found the <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/enhanced-ecommerce" rel="nofollow">documentation</a> at Google, which stated that </p>  <blockquote>   <p>The Enhanced Ecommerce plug-in should not be used alongside the   Ecommerce (ecommerce.js) plug-in for the same property.</p> </blockquote>  <p>This raised my concern, but I don't know what to do with this. Does this mean I have to remove all the previous ecommerce implementation? I cannot set up a new track object and track ID just for the enhanced ecommerce. Thanks.</p>
