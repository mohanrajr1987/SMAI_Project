<p>Sponsored Data enables apps or users to access a predetermined URL "free of charge" over mobile networks, while the data traffic is charged to the entity who provides the service through the app or website.</p>  <p>Hundreds of millions of users around the globe use sponsored services on a daily basis to access their bank accounts, use m-government services, buy through m-commerce and many other cases.</p>  <p>One of the simplest implementation of Sponsored Data requires the sponsor to send the mobile carriers a list of sponsored URLs. The mobile carrier then sets its network and billing to behave in the proper way.</p>  <p>This architecture present a challenge for the use of 3rd party APIs like google analytics for apps. The use of the app has an explicit promise of "free usage" but access to the analytics URL are charged by the mobile operator is it is not on the sponsor sponsored list.</p>  <p>As the URLs for the google analytics servers are (presumably) the same for all app analytics clients, this a sponsor can decide to either (a) not use app analytics (b) sponsor the google apps servers URLs and pay the traffic for every single app that use the analytics (not only his own app) or (c) breach its promise of free usage and deliver an app whose data usage is only partially free.</p>  <p>Therefore, I would like to know:</p>  <ol> <li>is there a way to have google app analytics servers respond to a unique URL</li> <li>is there a way to implement google app analytics server side (routing usage data to a server and then feeding the analytics engine)?</li> <li>is there any other way this that I am not seeing?</li> </ol>  <p>Best regards,</p>  <p>Oren Pinsky</p>
