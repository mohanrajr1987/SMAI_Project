<p>I've setup a goal in my Google Analytics that tracks account creation. For our purposes, we'd prefer to only track users that have confirmed their email address.</p>  <p>My steps to creating the goal:</p>  <pre><code>1. Goal Setup I set this to Acquisition -&gt; Create an account  2. Goal Description Name: Account Created Type: Destination  3. Goal Details Destination: Begins With -&gt; /users/confirmation?confirmation_token= </code></pre>  <p>In the goal details I've included the path of my app that is displayed when a user confirms their email address. The complete path would be <code>foobar.com/users/confirmation?confirmation_token=xxxxxxxx</code></p>  <p>It looks like this method is capturing some of the account creation events but not all of them (IE we have 10 users sign up yesterday but only 3 are showing in Google Analytics).</p>  <p>How do people typically track account creation conversions if they don't have a thankyou.html page?</p>
