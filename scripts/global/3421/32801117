<p>I'm using Android Studio and i generated signed APKs multiple times.<br> Today i have add Google Analytics (according to <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/android/v4/" rel="nofollow">this</a> guide) to my app, and when i tried to generate a signed APK, suddenly i get the error <code>Keystore was tampered with, or password was incorrect</code>.<br> Then i deleted all the changes i had to to do for getting the Analytics to work, and i succeed to generate signed APK.  </p>  <p>I saw some <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16891182/keytool-error-keystore-was-tampered-with-or-password-was-incorrect">questions</a>regarding the Keystore error i get, all use commands (such as <code>keytool -genkey -keystore ...</code>) but i'm generating the APK with <code>Build -&gt; Generate Signed APK</code></p>
