<p>I have an angular application where i am using <code>prerender</code> to index my site. </p>  <p>Since i started this (about a week ago) my leadfeeder has not been able to find any leads. </p>  <p>I find this odd because my <code>google analytics</code> shows that people are on my site. </p>  <p>So my question is how can i check that my <code>leadfeeder</code> is working correctly? Could <code>prerender</code> have any effect on <code>leadfeeder</code> or is this just a very odd coincidence ?</p>
