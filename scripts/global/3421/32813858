<p>I am trying to implement Google Analytics Campaign tracking with an app that has an opt in Beta program in the Play Store. So I can generate campaign urls all well and good but the first stop for a user in this scenario is an opt in auto generated web site for the beta program. Once they opt in they can click a link on that page to go to the download page in the play store and actually get the app. </p>  <p>Problem is, by the time the user goes to download the app, the url parameters I generated are long gone.  Any suggestions on how to get around this problem? I can't imagine you can only use or develop analytics campaigns with production mobile apps..</p>  <p>Reference: <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/android/v4/campaigns#general-campaigns" rel="nofollow">https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/android/v4/campaigns#general-campaigns</a></p>
