<p>In Google Analytics I have set up a Goal for a button to be pressed on a sign up contact form. It is to collect email addresses for a mailing list. The problem is that it does not work. I have followed three guides on this offering slightly different code for alternate approaches but have not got it to work.</p>  <p>In GA the Goal is setup as follow...</p>  <pre><code>Goal setup: Custom Name: Contact Type: Event Category Equals to Contact Action Equals to signup </code></pre>  <p>GA is tracking the page and analytics from users can be viewed so we can see it is working. We are using CloudFlare and GA is added on the fly to all pages served through their cloud.</p>  <p>The code for the button is below.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;button type="submit" onclick=”_gaq.push([‘_trackEvent’, ‘Contact’, ’signup’])” class="btn btn-success"&gt;Sign up&lt;/button&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Any help on this would be appreciated.</p>
