<p>I am currently developing a website with Symfony 2.7 and I have configured the  theme bootstrap_3_layout to be used by default in every form and it works perfectly. However, I need to render a specific form with a different template which doesn't wrap every field inside a div</p>  <p>The form I need to render in a different way has 2 visible fields and 2 hidden ones and is sent to the view with the name of pagination</p>  <pre><code>#app/config/config.yml twig:   debug:            "%kernel.debug%"   strict_variables: "%kernel.debug%"   form_themes:     - 'bootstrap_3_layout.html.twig' # forms theme by default     - 'VichUploaderBundle:Form:fields.html.twig'   #src/AppBundle/Resources/views/Form/fields.html.twig {% extends 'form_div_layout.html.twig' %}  {%- block form_row -%}   {{- form_label(form) -}}   {{- form_errors(form) -}}   {{- form_widget(form) -}} {%- endblock form_row -%}  {%- block button_row -%}   {{- form_widget(form) -}} {%- endblock button_row -%}  #src/AppBundle/Resources/views/Admin/Artist/show.html.twig {% form_theme pagination 'AppBundle:Form:fields.html.twig' %} {{ form(pagination) }}  </code></pre>  <p>The problem is that the submit button does not apply the wanted theme and is still being rendered with bootstrap. I have to add<br> <code>{% form_theme pagination 'AppBundle:Form:fields.html.twig' %}<br>{% form_theme pagination.submit 'AppBundle:Form:fields.html.twig' %}<br>{{ form(pagination) }}</code> to see both fields as I wanted. Why that's happening? What can I do to avoid declare the same multiple times?</p>
