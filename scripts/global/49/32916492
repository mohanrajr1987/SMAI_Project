<p>I have a situation were the only type of form element I can not make in the program I am using is a select options drop down and I need it so as to only give the one filling out the form the predefined list of states and city's to choose from to fill in the text inputs. </p>  <p>In other words, I need to know how to fill a text input with a date picker in either JavaScript or jquery. When someone goes to try and fill in that in by typing in a state, I want something to automatically pop up and give them options to select from like a drop down. </p>  <p>Can anyone help me figure that out? </p>
