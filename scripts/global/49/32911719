<p>I've been trying to show/hide a button based on the data currently in Input fields have been changed. It's an Account Update page, and the data is pulled from a database and inserted into the input fields. </p>  <p>I've found this topic and it's been mostly helpful: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32071618/jquery-disable-submit-button-unless-original-form-data-has-changed">JQuery - Disable submit button unless original form data has changed</a></p>  <p>I've also pulled and adjusted a snippet of code and was able to make it work how I wanted: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/Pug3H/97/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/Pug3H/97/</a></p>  <p>However when I try to implement this code onto my page it does not seem to work. A sample of how the input fields are populated from the database: </p>  <pre><code>    &lt;input type="text" name="Name" value="&lt;?= $row['Name'] ?&gt;" required /&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I'm not sure if this is conflicting with the serialize method and if I should be doing something differently? Any help is appreciated. Thanks!</p>
