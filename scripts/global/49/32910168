<p>I have a basic rails form that searches for parameters from a database. I want to track every time someone does a search (ie submits this form). My controller has 2 actions (an index where the form the located and a create with all the search stuff). Currently, when the form is submitted, it does not change the URL. The URL stays the name of the model. How do I change that in routes so that the URL will change allowing Analytics to see the number of times this page was visited?</p>  <pre><code>  resources :prices, only: [:index, :create] </code></pre>  <p>Thank you</p>
