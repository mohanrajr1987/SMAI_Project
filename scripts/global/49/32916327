<p>First off, I am having trouble describing my issue. I apologize in advanced if I am not seeing an existing answer online. How can I split this string into an array where each entry is the text within each set of square brackets. Here is the string:</p>  <pre><code>plan_year[benefit_groups_attributes][0][relationship_benefits_attributes][1][premium_pct] </code></pre>  <p>What I need to do is store the value in second set of square brackets. In this example it is [0]. .split hasn't given me the result I wanted, and I think it is because I am doing</p>  <pre><code>.split(/[[]]/); </code></pre>  <p>Should I expect something like this to work?</p>
