<p>I'm making a small website as a test. Very new to JavaScript and HTML forms so I thought i'd throw myself into what I consider to be the deep end and give it a go.</p>  <p>I'm trying to get an interger to be displayed on the page, that is  the result of a few calculations. </p>  <p>I want to find the difference between the first number (current value), and the second number (desired value) and then divide that number by 25 and store that as a variable. I then want to display that variable inside a message.</p>  <p>My current HTML :</p>  <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt;     &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/stylesheet.css"&gt;     &lt;title&gt;MMR calculator&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Type in your current MMR, and your desired MMR and click "Calculate"&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;form&gt;     &lt;input type="text" id="currentRating" placeholder="What is your current MMR?"&gt;     &lt;input type="text" id="desiredRating" placeholder="What is your desired MMR?"&gt;     &lt;input type="submit" onclick="calculate()"&gt; &lt;/form&gt; &lt;script src="js/main.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; </code></pre>  <p>My current JavaScript :</p>  <pre><code>function calculate() {     var currentRating = document.getElementById("currentRating");     var desiredRating = document.getElementById("desiredRating");      var difference = desiredRating - currentRating;     var gamesToPlay = difference / 25;      document.write("You need to play " + gamesToPlay + " to get to " + desiredRating); } </code></pre>
