<p><br> I'm working on a GUI for a chat bot and I want to build a windows form to just render text. I have tried to use TransparencyKey, but it doesn't work with the text anti aliasing of the text, as well as registering the form to support transparent BG. Also, overwriting the OnPaintBackground() has not helped much, as it renders random parts of the screen as background. If you have got an idea how to solve this problem, please answer. If this solution makes the form "click-throuable", even better! <br> Thanks in advance!</p>
