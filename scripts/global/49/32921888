<p>I was planning to integrate User feedback into my App.<br> Since the app is new, I was looking for <code>free</code> Feedback options. Google forms is the one which can be used.  </p>  <hr>  <p><strong>I have few approaches shortlisted</strong></p>  <ol> <li>Show Google Form in WebView</li> <li>Simulate the post request which Google invokes when user submits the form as seen in <a href="http://codesmith.in/post-data-google-drive-sheet-through-mobile-app/" rel="nofollow">this</a> article</li> </ol>  <hr>  <p><strong>I have few questions regarding this.</strong> </p>  <ol> <li>Is it legal to use Google Forms in WebView. If yes are the URL static ?  </li> <li>For simulating post request, the id's used for input fields are static or dynamic?</li> </ol>  <p>Also is there any free service for taking user feedback with restriction like 100 feedbacks per month ?</p>
