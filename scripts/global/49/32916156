<p>I have a page with two submit buttons using <code>if ($_POST['action'] == 'Test SMS')</code> to executed code for my "Test SMS" button. I need to execute code from a PHP script then give an alert box while not leaving the page.</p>  <p>I keep reading that ajax is the way to do this and I've tried, but index.php and updateUserConfig.php are on different servers, so I get cross-domain errors.</p>  <p>It also seems I'm not using the <code>header()</code> function correctly but the current code almost does exactly what I want. It executes the script without leaving the page, but I'm not getting the alert popup.</p>  <p>I've tried to redirect with js, but it won't redirect until "OK" is clicked on my alert button, so until then the browser is directed to an empty page that I don't want. </p>  <p>I've tried using JS on index.html, but I get the alert before the script is executed, and I don't have easy access to the PHP variable to alert what phone number a test text was sent to. </p>  <p>index.html</p>  <pre><code>&lt;form action="updateUserConfig.php" method="post"&gt; &lt;input type='submit' name='action' value='Test SMS' class='btn-test'&gt; &lt;input type="submit" name="action" value="Save" class="btn btn-primary"&gt; &lt;/form&gt; </code></pre>  <p>updateUserConfig.php</p>  <pre><code>if ($_POST['action'] == 'Test SMS') { //action for Test SMS Button     //grab ntid and phone from header    if(isset($_POST['ntid'])) $ntid = $_POST['ntid'];    if(isset($_POST['phone'])) $phone = $_POST['phone'];     //using the notify_sms_users funtion from send_notification.php    require 'send_notification.php';    notify_sms_users(array($ntid), "", 4);     //alert user that there message has been sent    $alert = "Your message has been sent to " . $phone;    echo '&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;alert("'.$alert.'");';    echo '&lt;/script&gt;';     header('Location: index.php');  } else {-----action for other submit button------} </code></pre>
