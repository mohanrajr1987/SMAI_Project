<p>I'm using Joomla and a form independent of Joomla located in a separate folder on the site.</p>  <p>If the user is logged into Joomla I'd like the name and email of this form to be populated with the user's data.</p>  <p>I'm trying something like the following, but it's not working:</p>  <pre><code> &lt;?php jimport('joomla.user.helper');        $user = JFactory::getUser();        $name = $user-&gt;name;        $email = $user-&gt;email;        ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>And then this in the value of the field:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php return $email ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Any help would be very much appreciated!</p>
