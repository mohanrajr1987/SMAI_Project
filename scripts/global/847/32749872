<p>so far we are only using rockettheme templates for our joomla 3. sites but I have found a very interesting shop theme (for virtuemart), which uses T3 and the developer couldn't tell me for sure if I will actually be able to use it on the current setup. </p>  <p>Can someone tell me if it is possible to use those two frameworks side by side (for different areas / menu items on a single side)? </p>
