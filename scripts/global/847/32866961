<p>Using MariaDB, Apache, PHP 5.4.x, RHEL 7</p>  <p>How do I allow configuration.php to be written to?</p>  <p>Installed Joomla several times, always ending up with the configuration.php file not writable.  I proceeded, copied the config content and created a new php file, placed it where Joomla lives, opened up the permissions, changed to apache:apache, still nothing.   I've referenced several articles, notably this one:  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16080877/installing-joomla-3-error-your-configuration-file-or-directory-is-not-writable?s=1|1.4723">Installing Joomla 3 Error: Your configuration file or directory is not writable</a></p>  <p>I have also tried creating an empty configuration.php file and placing it in the joomla root, opening up permissions - didnt work.</p>  <p>My current state of installation is configuration.php file in place, but unable to remove the installation directory via the web installer (assuming because I shoehorned the config file into place and still not being writable).</p>  <p>I've tried several permissions setups then attempting to remove the install directory without success.  Manually removing the install directory via rm -r only yields a totally inaccessible site forcing me to wipe my joomla files, databases, and install again. Thanks in advance.</p>
