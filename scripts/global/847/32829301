<p>I'm trying to change the text"shop-sidebar" in this page of my Joomla website using Virtuemart:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.goodlifestore.cl/finalgoodlife/index.php/shop" rel="nofollow">http://www.goodlifestore.cl/finalgoodlife/index.php/shop</a></p>  <p>I go toExtensions/Language Manager/Modifications/New</p>  <p>I search for "sidebar" and it says that the text is on the TPL_SHOP constant.</p>  <p>I change the text.</p>  <p>Save &amp; Close.</p>  <p>Text doesn't change.</p>  <p>I look for "sidebar" again and it appears again on TPL_SHOP like nothing happened.</p>  <p>I don't understand what's happening. Why aren't my changes being applied?</p>
