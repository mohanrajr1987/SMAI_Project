<p>I recently moved to an unmanaged VPS and added a Joomla component to a client website and received the following error when attempting to use a specific part of the component.</p>  <p>Fatal error: Call to undefined function mb_strtolower() in /home/oursite/public_html/components/com_rsfiles/helpers/files.php on line 135</p>  <p>I'm sure if this was on a shared machine the error would not have been thrown because they would have configured the server to accept it. But that is not my case. I have to configure it to work.</p>  <p>The original error lead me to identify if mbstring was enabled on our server and it was not. <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/FLn3K.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/FLn3K.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>So I wondered how I could enable it. Googled it! found it may be a derivative of the php.ini file so I tried to enable it using this php.ini definition. zend.multibyte = 1. After adding the line I restarted the Apache web server but the php info page still showed it disabled. :-(</p>  <p>After making the above modification I received a different error when attemoting to access the same page throwing the original error. This is the new error: </p>  <p>Fatal error: Could not convert the script from the detected encoding "UTF-8" to a compatible encoding in /home/psgadmincore/public_html/libraries/legacy/controller/legacy.php on line 609</p>  <p>There are 8 other mbstring items in the php.ini file but they are all commented out.</p>  <pre><code>;mbstring.language = Japanese ;mbstring.internal_encoding = EUC-JP ;mbstring.http_input = auto ;mbstring.http.output = SJIS ;mbstring.encoding_translation = On ;mbstring.detect_order = auto ;mbstring.substitute_character = none </code></pre>  <p>;mbstring.func_overload = 0</p>  <p>I un-commented all of these thinking they had to be enabled also, but the "Could not convert the script" error is returned.</p>  <p>Can someone please direct me to a procedure that outlines the steps necessary to include the "Multibyte String library"?</p>  <p>CENTOS 6.7 x86_64 virtuozzo w/Cpanel - php 5.4.33</p>  <p>These sites have not help me:  <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/ref.mbstring.php" rel="nofollow">http://php.net/manual/en/ref.mbstring.php</a> <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.zend.multibyte" rel="nofollow">http://php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.zend.multibyte</a></p>  <p>Thank you</p>
