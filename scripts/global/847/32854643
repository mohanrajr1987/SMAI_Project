<p>I am an old Joomla user and know this system quite well. But it still has some performance issues with page rendering, maybe because of different css/js includes by 3rd party components, non-optimized contend, including images, etc.</p>  <p>My question is: Is there a way to integrate Joomla's frontend with EmberJS/AngularJS, use Ember's routing, get all the data in JSON and have a faster frontend. In this way we can ignore Joomla's  on every page load, which will cut down my page's load time! </p>  <p>Do you think this is a good idea? There are a lot of articles where people are sharing their experience with EmberJS + Laravel or AngularJS + Laravel, for example. Joomla can stand for Laravel as a backend and provide EmberJS/AngularJS with the necessary info to render the correct page.</p>  <p>This way we can have the greatest CMS Joomla as a Single Page Application on the frontend.</p>  <p>Please let me know your ideas on this! Thank you!</p>
