<p>I am using <a href="http://extensions.joomla.org/extension/zoo" rel="nofollow">Zoo Component</a> in Joomla 1.5 and downloaded (export) data from Zoo component which is in XML format. Now, New version of Zoo component allow only JSON and CSV format to import data.</p>  <p>So, how to migrate Zoo component data to new version?</p>  <p>I have tried using online conversion tool which convert XML to JSON but not succeed.</p>
