<p>I'm working on a Joomla 1.5.15 site and trying to use the Phocamaps Component and Plugin on it. </p>  <p>I created a map and markers and tried to make it display on a custom HTML module, but only showed me the shortcode, so I googled it and after finding <a href="http://forum.joomla.org/viewtopic.php?f=428&amp;t=330139" rel="nofollow">this</a>.</p>  <p>I realized it was a limitation on the Joomla 1.5 platform, since modules didn't had the Load HTML option later included on other versions. The solutions included other modules that because of the old versions are no longer available, so I guess I need to rely on coding, does anyone know how could it be achieved to load plugins on modules?</p>  <p>I can't upgrade Joomla version, and on Phocamaps plugin docs it only states to activate Load HTML but this isn't available on Joomla 1.5</p>
