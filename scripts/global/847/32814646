<p>I'm new to Joomla, and I'm trying to create my portfolio on it. My issue right now is that I've hidden every header, detail, tag, etc under articles in Joomla, and somehow this header still shows: <a href="http://imgur.com/12o5t2I" rel="nofollow">http://imgur.com/12o5t2I</a></p>  <p>How do I get rid of this header through Joomla? Should I just hide it via CSS instead? I know I can just make it disappear in CSS, but I'm trying to learn how Joomla works so I'm able to work with it in future projects. Thanks in advance!</p>
