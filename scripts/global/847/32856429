<p>I've used chronoforms for my Joomla forms and it's great, but I haven't been able to figure out how to make the file upload process clean and efficient for iOS and Android devices with it.</p>  <p>What Joomla 3.x form is good at handling file uploads for iOS and Android? Or, how do I setup chronoforms to do it?</p>  <p>As is, in Android you are given the choice of several unfamiliar apps to choose a file, not Gallery or any form of file browser.  If there was a way to tell the OS the type of file it needs to be trying to upload it would work great.</p>
