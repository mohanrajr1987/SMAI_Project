<p>In my Joomla (1.5) installation I'm getting errors presumably because the JS code as it's pasted into the index.php file (above <code>&lt;/head&gt;</code>) is somehow changed when I look at the page source.</p>  <p>This is a set of screenshots of what's going on:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/kJout.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/kJout.jpg" alt=""></a> <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/VbXb9.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/VbXb9.png" alt=""></a> <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/J5WLo.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/J5WLo.jpg" alt=""></a></p>  <p>You can see my code is saying <code>src="undefined"!==typeof</code>, while the page source is saying <code>src="/undefined"!==typeof</code>.</p>  <p>I tried changing <code>src="/undefined"!==typeof</code> to <code>src=typeof MIX...!=='undefined'?==typeof</code> but it didn't help.</p>  <p>I get this in firebug:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>ReferenceError: MIXPANEL_CUSTOM_LIB_URL is not defined</p> </blockquote>  <p>It's my analytics code for MixPanel, &amp; it doesn't report page loads to my dashboard. I don't know how to get it to work.</p>
