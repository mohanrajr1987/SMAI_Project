<p>I am working with the Joomla Rocket Theme template 'Camber'. It has a horizontal split menu system. Virtually a horizontal dropline menu that only goes 2 levels. It then splits off to a side menu. This side menu is a module that you allocate to any position via the Gantry admin panel.</p>  <p>I have 2 problems I would appreciate any assistance with:</p>  <ol> <li><p>The Menu Title: It has 4 suffixes that control the look of the Menu Title. I would like to add a 5th suffix to remove the Menu entirely. I would simply like to know if anyone knows where or which css file I can amend to either remove the title/header, so I just have menu items and not a header/title, or how I can add the necessary code to include an additional suffix that removes the header. The same as the Joomla module parameter to allow you "Show/Hide" the Title.</p></li> <li><p>In addition, I would ideally like to change the css to allow me run another or 3rd horizontal level if possible. Any help would be appreciated. </p></li> </ol>  <p>The problem is in the RT template code, not Joomla.  If I created a Joomla module I could easily remove the header in the "Show/Hide" module parameters. Because the Split off from the main menu to a sub navigation or sub menu is automated in the gantry code, there is no actual side menu module as such. It appears on the website as a module, but there is no module in the admin module listing. Therefore I have no access to any parameters to change.</p>  <p>I have added a link to show the menu header/title I would like to remove: nachalministries.org/home/finance . It is the 'Finance Menu' (submenu title) I would like to remove the Title/Header, so the submenu appears more like an horizontal dropline menu item. Thanks again for any help and assistance if possible.</p>  <p>Kind Regards Mike</p>
