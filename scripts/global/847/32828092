<p>I have a joomla site and would like to integrate some old unfinished webcomics to it, so I can pick them up where I stopped in a CMS that won't leave me in an absolute frothing rage (thanks, wordpress).</p>  <p>I've got some experience with Joomla and I believe it would be a pretty good platform for managing multiple comics... except for the small issue of <em>horrid</em> navigation between pages/articles. Joomla's integrated article navigation is a humble but passable start, but if you intend to use categories to organize chapters then getting from the end of one to the beginning of the next is... yeah. This is a pity, as Joomla's category and article management options are beautiful for archiving and presentation, and adding gantry 5 to it means a great deal of control over the reading experience. Basically, joomla has pretty much everything I want, except for the navigation.</p>  <p>Ideally, what I'd like to be able to accomplish for comic navigation in joomla is:</p>  <ul> <li>Clickable full-article-image leading to next article/page</li> <li>Prev/next article buttons (already available)</li> <li>Prev/next category buttons (do we have those?)</li> <li>The latter two in a module I can choose where to publish (optional)</li> </ul>  <p>And this is it, basically. I understand that implementing the first could be very hard without some major template customization, in which case I'd be willing to insert the image as a link in the article body... but only if there was one single code I could use, like the one that generates the <em>next</em> category article button. Because I'm not willing to create hundreds of menu items to generate links page-by-page.</p>  <p>So is any of this doable?</p>
