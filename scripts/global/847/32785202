<p>I am making a backend extension for Joomla! 3.X. I have a view, where you can add, edit and delete entries. Entries are searchable. Searching is done with Joomla searchtools:</p>  <pre><code>echo JLayoutHelper::render('joomla.searchtools.default',array('view'&gt; $this)); </code></pre>  <p>Form used for filtering is defined as a XML form in <strong>/models/forms</strong> and filtering is handled by corresponding model.</p>  <p><strong>Problem:</strong> I would like to add descriptions to some of the numeric fields (see picture), which explain what each field does.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/tvkQz.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/tvkQz.png" alt="Filters"></a></p>  <p><strong>I tried:</strong></p>  <ul> <li><p>Adding <strong>label</strong> and <strong>description</strong> to my fields, but they do not show up (<strong>default</strong> does, but it is not usefull enough here, I need descriptions outside fields)</p></li> <li><p>Adding <strong>spacer</strong> field, but it does not show up in this context</p>  <p><code>&lt;field type="spacer" name="myspacer" label="Description of field" /&gt;</code></p></li> <li><p>Adding disabled text field with default value (it works, but it is not a clean solution)</p></li> <li><p>Editing search form with JavaScript located in my view (works, but is again not very clean)</p></li> </ul>  <p><strong>Question:</strong> Is there a clean way to add custom HTML (such as line breaks and descriptions of fields) to my form, which is defined in a XML document? </p>  <p>Thank you in advance!</p>
