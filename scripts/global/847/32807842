<p>I would like to develop a php-mysql application that more or less lets users:</p>  <ul> <li>Enrol</li> <li>Upload their files</li> <li>Chose some of the provided services</li> <li>Pay online</li> <li>Get they're edited files back</li> </ul>  <p>I would like to ask you which framework do you suggest for this web application regarding:</p>  <ol> <li>What it is best suit?</li> <li>Is any easy way to change templates</li> <li>What market uses most</li> </ol>  <p>I am using Joomla till now but in the case I want to have specific php code I think that I have to develop Joomla components something that raises the complexity.  However I like that its not a big task to find a new template in joomla and change it so easily. </p>  <p>I have heard also about laravel, Yii, codeigniter. Do you sugest one of them or something else? </p>
