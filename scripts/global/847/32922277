<p>I created a system plugin for Joomla. During installation of plugin I need to redirect user to an api and after redirection the api will add return values along with my callback url. But I'm not able to capture the values.</p>  <p>Here is my Code</p>  <pre><code>$cburl = 'http://'.$_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'].'/administrator/index.php?option=com_installer';     $finalurl = 'https://www.testapplication.com/merchants/app-install/?app=joomla&amp;d='.$domain.'&amp;cb_url='.$cburl.'';     $allDone =&amp; JFactory::getApplication();     $allDone-&gt;redirect($finalurl);   </code></pre>  <p>Here $cburl is the callback url to my application from api. I need to capture additional paramaters returned from api.</p>  <p>I managed to redirect users to api but the return values I'm not able to capture</p>  <p>How to do that?</p>
