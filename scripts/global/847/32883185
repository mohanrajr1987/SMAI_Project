<p>I'm trying to download Joomla-3.4.4 from <a href="https://www.joomla.org/download.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.joomla.org/download.html</a> to my CentOS server. The command i type is: <code>wget https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/releases/download/3.4.4/Joomla_3.4.4-Stable-Full_Package.zip</code> <br> But the system show that <br><br></p>  <pre><code>--2015-10-01 04:38:08--  https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/releases/download/3.4.4/Joomla_3.4.4-Stable-Full_Package.zip Resolving github.com (github.com)... 192.30.252.128 Connecting to github.com (github.com)|192.30.252.128|:443... failed: Connection refused. </code></pre>  <p><br></p>  <p>I have tried other site downloading using <code>wget</code> command, it works, so I still can't figure out why this URL cannot download. Thanks for replying.</p>
