<p>I want to link a chess viewer app (Java) to my database of games (MySQL) in the CMS my site uses (Joomla).<br> The chess viewer is called using an  tag in a standard Joomla document. One of the parameters is the file location of the chess file to be displayed.  I have a database containing a whole load of these pgn files, together with their location on the server, and I want the user to be able to scroll through the database, select the file they want, and then the document will call that file into the chess viewer. </p>  <p>I am OK writing the php to get the filename from the database - done that, but then how can I get the returned filename (currently in a php array variable) into my</p>  <p>[applet .....]</p>  <p>[PARAM name=PgnGameFile value=<em>returned PHP variable</em>]</p>  <p>Any suggestions gratefully received.</p>  <p>PS I'm no programmer - I learned Algol 66 many moons ago, and I can find my way around simple php at a pinch, but I've not programmed in earnest for over 25 years - systems managers have people for that and teachers give it to good 6th formers to do (that covers my working life) , so best to assume a newbie dunce :-) </p>
