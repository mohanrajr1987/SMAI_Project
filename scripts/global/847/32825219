<p>I am trying to find out a way to debug my joomla powered website. This is a very new field for me, so I am following the "Using an IDE" steps on this page: <a href="https://docs.joomla.org/How_to_debug_your_code" rel="nofollow">https://docs.joomla.org/How_to_debug_your_code</a> and some other related pages(For configuring eclipse, xdebug, etc..).</p>  <p>As the page suggests, xdebug is a prevailing tool for debugging. I have never heard it before,  now the only thing I know about it is that it is an extension of PHP which help debug. I noticed that in my XAMPP installation, xdebug is installed(at least there is a xdebug section in php.ini), however, in my webspace, there is no xdebug section in php.ini. So my questions are:</p>  <p>1) Being there no xdebug section in php.ini of my webspace, does this mean my webserver doesn't support xdebug? If yes, is there any web hosting company that has xdebug available, or at least offer this possibility? </p>  <p>2) Regardless of xdebug, is it possible to debug(set breakpoint, watch variables, etc..) PHP files in a joomla site in a remote server? Is it a common practice to clone the site to local before debugging it?</p>  <p>3) My xampp control panel version is 3.2.1. About xdebug configuration in XAMPP, on this page <a href="https://docs.joomla.org/Edit_PHP.INI_File_for_XDebug" rel="nofollow">https://docs.joomla.org/Edit_PHP.INI_File_for_XDebug</a> it says "For Windows, it should look like the example below:</p>  <pre><code>[XDebug] ;; Only Zend OR (!) XDebug zend_extension_ts="C:\xampp\php\ext\php_xdebug.dll" xdebug.remote_enable=true xdebug.remote_host=localhost xdebug.remote_port=10000 xdebug.remote_handler=dbgp </code></pre>  <p>However, the xdebug section in my php.ini looks like this</p>  <pre><code>[XDebug] ;zend_extension = "D:\xampp\php\ext\php_xdebug.dll" ;xdebug.profiler_append = 0 ;xdebug.profiler_enable = 1 ;xdebug.profiler_enable_trigger = 0 ;xdebug.profiler_output_dir = "D:\xampp\tmp" ;xdebug.profiler_output_name = "cachegrind.out.%t-%s" ;xdebug.remote_enable = 0 ;xdebug.remote_handler = "dbgp" ;xdebug.remote_host = "127.0.0.1" ;xdebug.trace_output_dir = "D:\xampp\tmp" </code></pre>  <p>How should I edit it in order to enable xdebug? Specifically do I need to set "remote port"?</p>
