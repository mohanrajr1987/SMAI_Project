<p>I have a problem with the <code>audio</code> element.</p>  <p>I mean that if I put this eleent on a page, the audio starts <strong>twice</strong> (with a little delay).</p>  <p>The code is the following:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;audio src="images/audio/basemusicale.mp3" autoplay="autoplay"   controls="controls" type="audio/mpeg"&gt;&lt;/audio&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I use the latest Joomla version (3.4.4).</p>  <p>And how can I automatically play it on a smartphone too?</p>  <p>I have seen that in a smartphone it doesn't autoplay (like, on a Nexus 4).</p>  <p>Thank you in advance at all.</p>  <p>I attend your answers. Thanks</p>
