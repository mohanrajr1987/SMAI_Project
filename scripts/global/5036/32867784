<p>As an academic scholar, I read countless articles which I download to my computer. The formatting of the references of the articles I read are in APA. As such, the articles are usually cluttered with in-text citations in this format: (author name 1, author name 2, year).</p>  <p>I was wondering if there was a script which I could run to automatically highlight all text in between parentheses in a specific highlight color in preview? </p>
