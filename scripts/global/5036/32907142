<p>I was writing a C++ program to test my pointer and reference knowledge and so grabbed an address and I couldn't modify the value in it which was 0; Any idea why that happened? I named the line "buggy line"</p>  <pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;  using namespace std;  int main() {     int value = 6;     int* point = &amp;value;     int value2 = 9000;     *point = 5;     point = &amp;value2;     point+=4000;     *point = 0;  //the buggy line     cout &lt;&lt; *point &lt;&lt; endl;     cout &lt;&lt; value; } </code></pre>
