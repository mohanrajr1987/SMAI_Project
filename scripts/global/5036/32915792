<p>I'm not asking the difference between pointer and reference. Just a bit confused about the difference between reference and alias.</p>  <p>As far as I'm concerned, reference is a <strong>data type</strong> while <strong>alias</strong> is just a word describing the utility of this <strong>data type</strong>?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
