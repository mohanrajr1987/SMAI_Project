<p>What is the best way to do the following:</p>  <p>I have a class A, which creates and holds objects from class B. Object of class B is doing his own things, and sometimes he has to call a method of a parent object (of class A). I heard it is not the best idea to hold a reference of object A in object B (Idea is shown in the code snippet).</p>  <pre><code>Class A{     private B objectB;     public A(){         objectB = new B(this);     }     public void methodA(){         // [...]     } }  Class B{     private A objectA;     public B(A objectA){         this.objectA = objectA;     }     public void methodB(){         // [...] do some stuff        objectA.methodA();     } } </code></pre>  <p>Is it really a bad approach to do this? Is there a better way?</p>
