<p>I new to Visual C# and just wanted to create a tiny CLI-based application. With the written codes below, I am receiving this error: "Object reference not set to an instance of an object.". Obviously, since I'm a noob, I have no idea how fix the problem.</p>  <p>Here's the code I have in Program.cs:</p>  <pre><code>class Program {     static void Main(string[] args)     {         GetAverage(args);     }      static void GetAverage(string[] s)     {         var ave = new Average();          ave.arg = s;         ave.FindAverage();         ave.DisplayResult();     } } </code></pre>  <p>Here's the code I have in the Average.cs:</p>  <pre><code>public class Average {     public Average()     {         Console.Write("\n" + "Given numbers: ");          foreach (string s in this.arg)         {             Console.Write(this.arg + " ");              num += Double.Parse(s);         }     }      public double num = 0;     public string[] arg;     public double result;      public void FindAverage()     {         this.result = this.num / this.arg.Length;     }      public void DisplayResult()     {         Console.WriteLine("\n" + "Average: " + this.result);     } } </code></pre>  <p>What I wanna do is to access the arguments from Main method of the Program class so that I can work with it from the Average class. </p>  <p>Please help me with this one. Thanks!</p>
