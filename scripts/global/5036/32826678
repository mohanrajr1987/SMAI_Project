<p>I am writing an SSIS package that has required me to use the Microsoft.Exchange.WebServices DLL. I have imported it into the VB Script Task where it is referenced from the following location:</p>  <p>C:\Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange\Web Services\2.0\Microsoft.Exchange.WebService.dll</p>  <p>The script task seems to 'like' it in so much that I have imported the Namespace and am able to declare the ExchangeService as an object. However, when it comes to running the package (both compiled and in debug) I get the following error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>System.IO.FileNotFoundException: Could not load file or assembly   'Microsoft.Exchange.WebServices, Version=15.0.0.0, Culture=neutral,   PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35' or one of its dependencies. The   system cannot find the file specified.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I have checked the Regedit and can see that the DLL exists there... I am sure I am missing something silly... Is anyone able to help??</p>  <p>Thanks! Chris</p>
