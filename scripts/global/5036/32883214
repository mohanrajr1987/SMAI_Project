<p>I was thinking R does not use pointers nor references. However, I have faced the issue of dynamic changes into a function. Here's a MWE to make my point clear:</p>  <pre><code>&gt; a = function(x) 2 &gt; b = function(x) a(x) &gt; b(4) [1] 2 &gt; a = function(x) 3 &gt; b(4) [1] 3 </code></pre>  <p>while I was expecting changing <code>a</code> won't change <code>b</code>. For example, if I do:</p>  <pre><code>&gt; a = function(x) 2 &gt; b  = a &gt; b(4) [1] 2 &gt; a = function(x) 3 &gt; b(4) [1] 2 </code></pre>  <p>I understand in the first case no copy of <code>a</code> is done; instead R looks for a function <code>a</code> into the GlobalEnvir each time I call <code>b</code> while in the second one it makes a copy, is that correct ? But if my function <code>a</code> is iteratively modified while I want <code>b</code> to use it as it was at the right moment where I defined <code>b</code>, what is the right way to do it. For now, I have thought using a copy of <code>a</code>:</p>  <pre><code>&gt; a = function(x) 2 &gt; aa = a &gt; b = function(x) aa(x) &gt; b(4) [1] 2 &gt; a = function(x) 3 &gt; b(4) [1] 2 </code></pre>  <p>but this won't work if I update <code>a</code> more than once (because I'll also update <code>aa</code>).</p>  <p>thanks</p>
