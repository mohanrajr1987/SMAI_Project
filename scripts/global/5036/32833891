<p>I'm trying to add strings to a <code>List&lt;string&gt;</code> so I can print them with a loop in a certain point of time, being more specific here is part of my code:</p>  <pre><code>public class Foo{     public string propertyA;     public string propertyB;     public string propertyC;     public List&lt;string&gt; list;     Public Foo(){          list = new List&lt;string&gt;();          list.Add(propertyA);          list.Add(propertyB);          list.Add(propertyC);     } } </code></pre>  <p>In later code, after assigning <code>propertyA</code> and the other variables and trying to iterate over the List I get empty strings. I require the properties to be in the list. My questions is which would be the best way to achieve this?</p>
