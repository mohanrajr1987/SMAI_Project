<p>I have been brushing up on array concepts in C++, when I came across this question: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2302279/return-an-array-in-c">Return an array in c++</a></p>  <p>Someone answered using this declaration:</p>  <pre><code>int (&amp;f(int (&amp;arr)[3]))[3] </code></pre>  <p>What I can't seem to grasp is the [3] after the closing parenthesise. I've never seen a function declaration that looked like this. I understand the rest of the syntax, but I don't particularly understand how the [3] works because it is after the function name. I apologize in advance if I'm overlooking something simple. I also tried looking at the spec for function declarations but I didn't see anything related that I could link to the subscript syntax. So, how is this possible?</p>
