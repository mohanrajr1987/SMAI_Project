<p>I trying to get deep into WordPress development, I was wondering when we do <code>var_dump($post-&gt;post_id)</code>, it gives a list of objects that, that function has. The reason I said objects, is I don't know what they are. While it gives you a comprehensive list of properties that you can access as the WordPress codex <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/$post" rel="nofollow">page</a> state. My question is how can I access other function and its properties like:</p>  <pre><code>`get_the_category();`, I might be naive to get a list of properties like  $category = get_the_category(); foreach ($category as $cat) { echo $cat; } </code></pre>  <p>How can I access properties of a WordPress function, a example would be something like <code>$category-&gt;ID()</code> or other properties, other example might include</p>  <pre><code>      &lt;?php          if ( have_posts() ) {           while ( have_posts() ) {             the_post();          ?&gt;         &lt;?php                $test = get_cat_ID($post-&gt;ID);                var_dump($test)         ?&gt;          &lt;?php }        }        ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>But in that example, I get a <code>int(0)</code>, so how can I get different properties on a post, like its category, slug, taxonomies etc. </p>
