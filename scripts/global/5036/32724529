<pre><code>data numbers; input num; datalines; 3 1 3 ; run;  %macro temp(num); proc sql; select count(*) into :count from numbers; quit;     %if &amp;num eq &amp;count %then          %put Match Found;     %else          %put No Match Found; %symdel count; %mend;  data _NULL_; set numbers; call execute('%temp('||num||')'); run; </code></pre>  <p>Why this code is showing error though everything is correct. I am checking the values in data set number to find match between overall count with variable number (just for practice) I got count using proc SQL, after checking the conditions I  am deleting the count macro variable. After execution why SAS is giving the error message. Please explain whats really happening in this code.</p>  <pre><code>LOG-----when I execute the last data step---------&gt;      6188   data _NULL_;     6189   set numbers;     6190   call execute('%temp('||num||')');     6191   run;      NOTE: Numeric values have been converted to character values at the places given by:                 (Line):(Column).                 6190:24     Match Found     WARNING: Apparent symbolic reference COUNT not resolved.
