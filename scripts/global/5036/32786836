<p>New to C# and have an console application that accesses Windows WMI. I added:</p>  <pre><code>using System.Management; using System.Management.Instrumentation; </code></pre>  <p>Also added the reference and set "CopyToLocal" to true on both references. I do see the two .dll's in the "bin/debug" directory, however, when running on another computer (where I did not compile the source on), I still get the error that the two references are not found.</p>  <p>Can anyone help? Sorry, I am sure this is a very basic question. <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/v9gvt.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/v9gvt.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>The exception that I get is:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Unhandled Exception: System.UnauthorizedAccessException: Access id denied. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80070005 (E_ACCESS_DENIED) at System.Runtime.InteropService.Marshal.ThrowExcetpionForHRInternal(Int32 errorcCode, IntPtr, errorInfo) at System.Runtime.InteropService.Marshal.ThrowExceptionForHR(Int32 errorCode) at System.Management.ManagementScope.InitializeGuts(Object o) at System.Management.ManagementScrope.Initialize() at System.Management.ManagementScropt.Connect()</p> </blockquote>  <p>I truly appreciate all the help!</p>
