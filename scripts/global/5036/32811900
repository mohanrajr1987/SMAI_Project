<p>Running <code>knitr</code> and laTeX to create a PDF, what code allows you to extract all the references that are in the .Rnw script?  </p>  <p>There seems to be no auxiliary file created for references like there are for the table of contents and list of figures.  </p>  <p>Note: a separate question just posted on StackOverflow, asks about a solution using regex, but a problem that came up when trying to extract references that way.</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>  <p>Is there a way with R to find and pull out the latex references?</p>
