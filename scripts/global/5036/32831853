<p>I have a C# software that uses System.IO.Compression. This is the only reference that a user requires to have installed on their PC in order to use my software. Because of that, the software asks you to install .NET Framework 4.5. So a better understanding of my question is, how can I place the System.IO.Compression .dll file in the directory my software is installed in so it can get the reference from there?</p>
