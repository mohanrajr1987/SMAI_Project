<p>I have a project in .Net 4.5, however when I try to add a framework reference all that is available to me are 4.0 options. Why is this happening and what can I do to get the 4.5 references options?</p>  <p>Thank you in advance.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/h9VBt.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/h9VBt.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
