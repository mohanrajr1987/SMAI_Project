<p>Say I have a class that looks like this</p>  <pre><code>class MyAnimals{ public:     Animal getAnimal(int index){         return animals.at(index);     } private:     vector&lt;Animal&gt; animals; } </code></pre>  <p>From what I've learned about C++ so far, I think <code>getAnimal</code> currently returns a copy of the animal, not a reference like in Java. I've seen this suggested as the correct way to go about returning objects, but what if you want to modify that animal once it's returned? I'd just be changing the copy of it and the actual animal inside of MyAnimals.animals would remain unchanged. One way I've seen to get around this is to return <code>Animal&amp;</code> instead of <code>Animal</code>, and that seems to work for the most part, but what if I want to reassign the variable the was assigned to that returned Animal? For example,</p>  <pre><code>Animal&amp; a = myanimals.getAnimal(1); a = myanimals.getAnimal(2); </code></pre>  <p>From what I get, this would change the animal at <code>myanimals.animals[1]</code> to be the same exact object as <code>myanimals.animals[2]</code>, since a was a reference. What are the different ways to go about returning objects?</p>
