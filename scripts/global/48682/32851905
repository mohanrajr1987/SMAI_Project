<p>I have been doing some benchmarks on a promise extension that I wrote, and I have stumbled upon some results that I cannot fathom: I'm getting consistently faster performance on a promise-based sequence calculation than doing the same directly, without promises.</p>  <p>Here's the test description: <a href="https://github.com/vitaly-t/spex/blob/master/docs/concept/sequencing.md" rel="nofollow">Linked and Detached Sequencing</a> (I thought it would be perhaps too much reposting all that here).</p>  <p>Is there any special consideration within NodeJS that under increased load changes the way the engine works, so resolving promises during a heavy sequence calculation may result in increased performance? This is just my best guess for now, though perhaps a dumb one, I'm really scratching my head over this.</p>
