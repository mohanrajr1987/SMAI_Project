<p>This is our code inside a single function. I'm just beginning to get better with BackboneJS.</p>  <pre><code>// let's pull desktop data this.desktop = new desktopItemModel({device: 'desktop'}); this.desktopPromise = this.desktop.fetch();  // let's pull mobile data this.mobile = new mobileItemModel({device: 'mobile'}); this.mobilePromise = this.mobile.fetch();  // I'm not sure if the previous developer was trying to implement similar to $q.all this.allPromise = [desktopPromise, mobilePromise];  $.when(this.desktopPromise).done(_.bind(function() {    // do your desktop stuff }, this)); $.when(this.mobilePromise).done(_.bind(function() {    // do your mobile stuff }, this));  if (this.allPromise) {   $.when.apply($, this.allPromise).done(_.bind(function() {     // do your stuff here if desktop     ....     // do your stuff here if mobile     ....   }, this)); } </code></pre>  <p>I noticed that there are times that our data in our variable gets mixed up between desktop and mobile. The response from the api server is fine. I actually suspected that the API team was returning us wrong data until I debugged our app, it was our code that was doing something weird.</p>  <p>How can this be refactored so that data doesn't get mixed up? Someone told me in irc, "promises have weird behaviors".</p>
