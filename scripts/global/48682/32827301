<p>I'm working with ember.js and have a problem with the <a href="https://github.com/jpadilla/ember-cli-simple-auth-token" rel="nofollow">simple auth token</a> package not returning a rejected promise, and I'm not sure why.</p>  <p>The issue that I'm trying to solve is to show an error message if the authentication is rejected, for this example we can even just show a hard-coded message if it fails for any reason. The behavior that I'm seeing is that a couple errors show up in the console, but no message is shown.</p>  <p><code>POST http://localhost:8000/v1/auth/login/ 400 (BAD REQUEST)</code></p>  <p><code>undefined: _emberMetalLogger["default"].error(error.stack);</code></p>  <pre><code>// my authenticate action authenticate: function() {    let store = this.container.lookup('store:main');    let credentials = this.getProperties('identification', 'password'),       authenticator = 'simple-auth-authenticator:token';       let authPromise = this.get('session').authenticate(authenticator, credentials);        authPromise.then(() =&gt; {         console.log('inside authPromise');         let userPromise = store.find('user', {username: credentials.identification});          userPromise.then(user =&gt; {             console.log("inside userPromise");             store.find('store', {user: user.get('firstObject').get('id')}).then(function(store) {                 this.get('appController').set('myStore', store.get('firstObject'));             });         }, err =&gt; {             console.log('in error block');             this.set('errorMessage', 'Unable to login with the provided credentials');         });     }); } </code></pre>  <p>My authenticate action fires, but it never can get into the error block, nor can it reach inside the <code>authPromise</code>. As soon as it defines the authPromise the error happens and everything stops. I've tried even putting a try/catch around it, but I can't get anything returned with that etiher. I would expect the promise to reject and use the second function with the following response.</p>  <p>Diving a little further into the guts, I wanted to make sure the promise was being rejected properyly. In the package the authenticate function is fired and it does reject the promise according to the <code>console.log()</code> that I put in while debugging. The 2 variables it uses in the reject are defined as well, so I'm not sure when I'm not getting the rejected promise returned.</p>  <pre><code>// authenticate action in the ember-simple-auth-token package authenticate: function(credentials) {     var _this = this;     return new Ember.RSVP.Promise(function(resolve, reject) {       var data = _this.getAuthenticateData(credentials);       _this.makeRequest(data).then(function(response) {         Ember.run(function() {           resolve(_this.getResponseData(response));         });       }, function(xhr) {         Ember.run(function() {           console.log('rejecting');           reject(xhr.responseJSON || xhr.responseText);         });       });     });   }, </code></pre>
