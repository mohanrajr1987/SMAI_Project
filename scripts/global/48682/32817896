<p>I have a very simple function:</p>  <pre><code>function player(aud) { aud.play() } </code></pre>  <p>aud is an Audio object.</p>  <p>The function is activated on load. It plays a short audio clip. I want something to happen AFTER the clip has completed. Call it doSomething()</p>  <p>So I want to call doSomething(args) after clip has completed.</p>  <p>I'm doing my nut trying to figure this out. Every example I've seen involves setTimeout or setInterval. I can do those in my sleep.</p>  <p>PLEASE help</p>
