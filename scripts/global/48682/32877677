<p>I have a question about ASP.NET MVC and partialview rendered by ajax. Assuming I want to write a todo list app,for now I consider 2 partial views as following just for simplicity sake</p>  <ol> <li>TodoList</li> <li>EditForm</li> </ol>  <p>Here is what I want to do page loads with an ajax call renders ToDoList partial view. as you know the list will have a  link to edit and delete records (tasks). what I want is when user clicks edit an ajax call renders EditForm (which is a separate partial view) when they finished editing and closed the partial view dialog box the TodoList have to get updated using ajax call.</p>  <p>Now my question is how should I handle this correctly -- as who is responsible for watching this change and update particular partial view?</p>  <p>What I was thinking was a java-script module like a controller (that sits in the say the page that content all this partial views)manages loading of these partial views and it loads the edit partial view when edit clicked by user and waits for a promise/callback to be done(when edit was done). Then the same module will call update on the ToDoList partial view.</p>  <p>The reason I chose this approach is to have multiple external javascripts each has their own responsibility and less dependency on the view itself. The thing is then I should have callbacks per each event that can happen by any partial views.</p>  <p>If you guys can help me on this or tell me if there is a better way of doing it. I googled a lot but most of the solution have a lot of dependencies between partial views which I want to avoid.</p>  <p>Any comment would be appreciated. even if you guys think this is a wrong way to do the job!!</p>
