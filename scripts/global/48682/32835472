<p>Now that ES6 is officially standard in Node 4.x, how do you use Promises? Do modules (for example the native <code>fs</code> module) automatically work with Promises? Or modules have to be written specifically to work with Promises? How do you know what you can use a Promise with and what you can't?</p>  <p>There have been so many different Promise implementations (Q, Bluebird, etc) that I am confused on where to start with native Promises in Node 4.x.</p>
