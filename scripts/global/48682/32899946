<p>I have a test failing in Mocha with this error.</p>  <p>I have put <code>catch</code> statements at the end of every promise's chain that throw any error they are passed but they are never called.</p>  <p>And yet the test keeps failing with the following error:</p>  <pre><code>Error: Promise rejected with no or falsy reason   at tryCatcher (node_modules/bluebird/js/main/util.js:26:23)   at Promise._settlePromiseFromHandler (node_modules/bluebird/js/main/promise.js:507:31)   at Promise._settlePromiseAt (node_modules/bluebird/js/main/promise.js:581:18)   at Promise._settlePromises (node_modules/bluebird/js/main/promise.js:697:14)   at Async._drainQueue (node_modules/bluebird/js/main/async.js:123:16)   at Async._drainQueues (node_modules/bluebird/js/main/async.js:133:10)   at Immediate.Async.drainQueues [as _onImmediate] (node_modules/bluebird/js/main/async.js:15:14) </code></pre>  <p>How do I find out what the problem is exactly, which promise gets rejected and get a more meaningful trace?</p>
