<p>I made two aplications using openGl.  One uses glDrawElements (draws gl_triangles) and drawing some objects on the screen and works on all tested machines.  Second uses glDrawArrays to draw gl_points and uses computeshader to update theirs positions. This aplications runs only on my computer (iam using VS2010 and AMD GPU). But on all other machines its giving black screen with no points and high gpu usage which probably means that computeshader works. All other computer had nVidia graphics cards, no AMD tested (besides my).</p>  <p>I dont paste code because i assume if on my computer everything works as is suppose its something with drivers or dlls which are missing from windows or SysWOW64 folder. What files do i need to attach to my application to make it works on all machines?</p>  <p>I used this tutorial: <a href="http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~mjb/cs557/Handouts/compute.shader.1pp.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~mjb/cs557/Handouts/compute.shader.1pp.pdf</a> to make computeshader works. Thanks</p>  <p>UPDATE: It probably works on AMD but not on nvidia. Any ideas?</p>
