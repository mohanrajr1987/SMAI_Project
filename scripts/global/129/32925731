<p>I'm trying to create a few demos to help my understanding of OpenGL, GLEW and GLFW.  I found something interesting that I cannot seem to correct.  I'm trying to render a simple set of a checkerboard.</p>  <pre><code>    float points[] = {    0.0f,  1000.0f,  0.0f,    500.0f, 500.0f,  0.0f,    0.0f, 500.0f,  0.0f,     0.0f,  1000.0f,  0.0f,    500.0f, 500.0f,  0.0f,    500.0f, 1000.0f,  0.0f,     1000.0f,  0.0f,  0.0f,    500.0f, 500.0f,  0.0f,    1000.0f, 500.0f,  0.0f,     1000.0f, 0.0f,  0.0f,    500.0f, 500.0f,  0.0f,    500.0f, 0.0f,  0.0f }; </code></pre>  <p>If I create the window with the initial size 1000,1000:</p>  <pre><code> GLFWwindow* window = glfwCreateWindow(1000, 1000, "Simple example", NULL, NULL); </code></pre>  <p>The checkerboard shows up correctly: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/bIEuG.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/bIEuG.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>however if I create the window initially with 640,480 size and resize it, I get the following image:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/uWPXf.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/uWPXf.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I've tried a few different ways of resizing, this seemed to be the simplest:</p>  <pre><code>int FB_width, FB_height; glfwGetFramebufferSize(window, &amp;FB_width, &amp;FB_height); int win_width, win_height; glfwGetWindowSize(window, &amp;win_width, &amp;win_height);  float width   = 1000; float height  = 1000; glfwSetWindowSize(window, width, height); glfwSetFramebufferSizeCallback(window, framebuffer_size_callback); glClear (GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT); glfwSwapBuffers (window); </code></pre>  <p>where:</p>  <pre><code>void framebuffer_size_callback(GLFWwindow* window, int width, int height) {     glViewport(0, 0, width, height); } </code></pre>  <p>I've tried creating the window larger initially (1200,1600) and then resizing smaller (640, 480) and then increasing it again to 1000,1000: same results.  I know there is a difference between window coordinates and pixel coordinates, however I thought those would be correlated with the callback function.</p>  <p>I did not see a way to set the framebuffer size directly, is there something else that needs to be done?</p>
