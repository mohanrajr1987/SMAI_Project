<p>I want to ask a question about my project c++ and openGL. I want to create a lib (its name is SEED) who includes glm, assimp, anttweakbar... The compilation works fine on window on visual studio and on linux. I want to create a project main who contains an example of main to use the SEED lib, but I don't want to link the project main to the libs as glm, assimp...  How do i do?</p>
