<p>I have drawn a binary tree. The tree's nodes are circle (drawn using Midpoint algorithm) and leaf nodes are square ( each side drawn using Bresenham's line drawing algorithm) and the nodes are connected by lines ( drawn using Bresenham's line drawing algorithm). The coordinates of nodes have been obtained by Binary tree drawing algorithm by Knuth.How can I rotate the tree by 90 degrees. <br>PS: I am quite new to OpenGL.</p>
