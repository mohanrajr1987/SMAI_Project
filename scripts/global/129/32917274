<p>I've recently started learning c++ with the intention of making small games and the like, and after having learnt the basics of the language I've decided to try to get opengl working such that I can start to get some visual feedback to what I'm making. Unfortunately after going through <a href="http://learnopengl.com/" rel="nofollow">these tutorials</a> to try and set it up I've ran into the wall of the tutorials being designed for visual basic. I've got up to using cmake to generate the files, but from there I'm kinda stuck. What do I do from here now?</p>
