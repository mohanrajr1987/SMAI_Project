<p>I'm learning openGL. I have a background layout with 3D object and a HUD layer with some button. The HUD layer have to stay top.</p>  <p>I set my SurfaceView to transparent, but need use setZOrderOnTop(true) for the transparent SurfaceView. Then the 3D object cover the HUD. How "convert" my SurfaceView to transparent without change the zindex? I read all similar topic in StackOverflow, but didn't help.</p>  <ul> <li>bringtofront(), not help for me</li> <li>getHolder().setFormat(PixelFormat.RGBA_8888), not help for me</li> </ul>  <p>pls don't link other topic because I read all.</p>
