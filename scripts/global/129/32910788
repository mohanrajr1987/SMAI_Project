<p>I've checked numerous posts and tutorial about using OpenGL and C++. There is one thing that still bothers me. In each tutorial you have some additional library like GLFW, GLU, GLUT, WIN32 and so on (mostly used for window creation). Although I was unable to find some tutorial using only OpenGL. The only clue is this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/879128/1080517">answer</a> syaing that you need to use some library for this.</p>  <p>Can someone explain how it really is? How it looks when I want to use code on different operating systems? Is application code written with OpenGL 100% portable?</p>
