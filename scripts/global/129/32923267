<p><strong>The problem:</strong></p>  <p>There is a parabola on a plane defined by 3 points. Here you can see what it looks like. (this is what I made so far...) : <a href="http://i.giphy.com/3o85xzCsUh2fWlr5sI.gif" rel="nofollow"><em>Gif about the process</em></a></p>  <p>So I want to fill with a color the inner part of the parabola and with a different color the outer part. From the 3 points I calculate the equation of the parabola.</p>
