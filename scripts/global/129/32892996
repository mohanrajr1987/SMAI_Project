<p>I develop application that work like editor so i need docking library. I took Pinta.Docking from Pinta open source project (which is based on xamarin/monodevelop studio docking) and slighty modified in order to support GL context (i added callback OnBeforeChangeMode which set glwidget as not initialized because this library work by destroying and recreating widget/floating window so i have to bind context to new window)</p>  <p>everything work on first run which look like this:</p>  <p><a href="http://s14.postimg.org/4qib970jl/correctwin.png" rel="nofollow">http://s14.postimg.org/4qib970jl/correctwin.png</a></p>  <p>i can even reorganize space and create floating window:</p>  <p>s22.postimg.org/e0rplzxjl/correctagain.png</p>  <p>but as soon as i want to convert one window to "notebook" then my widget lost OnExposeEvent which is crucial for rendering and look like this:</p>  <p><a href="http://s15.postimg.org/fuzgj0ot7/notcorrect.png" rel="nofollow">http://s15.postimg.org/fuzgj0ot7/notcorrect.png</a></p>  <p>and what worse this error keep even if i "unnotebook" until i make floating window where quite often error failed swap buffer happen due to no onexposeevent (but sometime theres no error and window is sucesfully restored)</p>  <p>at first i thought widget is null when in notebook mode or i missed OnBeforeChangeMode callback somewhere but i was wrong. I reimplemented rendering callback in Idle event but this didnt help either (but was called though even in notebook mode)</p>  <p>The hardest part is that now i completely have no idea where to look for bug since onexposeevent cannot be tracked since there is no calls. Im only sure that problem lie in pinta.docking library since first run work correct as shown above. I tested against standard gtk widget like label and docking work correctly in all cases</p>  <p>So i have two questions: do you have any suggestion or wild guess where to look or you know about any better docking library for gtk# that might work with gl context or know about open source editor that sucessfully implemented docking in gtk#?</p>
