<p>The question I have is quite fundamental but for some strange reason I could not find a straight answer to this anywhere on the web:</p>  <p>How can I interpret OpenGL Window Coordinates?</p>  <p>I know how the NDC --> Window Coordinates transformation works but what I don't see is a definition of how OpenGL's "Window Coordinates" relate to actual pixel coordinates (where typically pixel centers are at whole numbers). It's basically a +/- 0.5 pixel question.</p>  <p>From the OpenGL 4.5 spec (13.6.1 -- Controlling the Viewport):<br> "... x and y give the location of the viewport's lower left corner ..."</p>  <p>So does "lower left corner" mean<br> a) the lower left corner <strong>of the lowest-leftmost pixel</strong> or<br> b) just the pixel coordinate of the lowest leftmost pixel?</p>  <p>If it's a) then I guess to go from Window Coordinates to Pixel coordinates one would have to subtract 0.5 from the WC.</p>
