<p>After researching online, I have come up with the following database tables.  Here are some information to assist with my approach.  I will be using Yii Framework for development.</p>  <ol> <li><p>Each vehicle has many service types.</p></li> <li><p>Each vehicle will have it's own set of check-list questions, to be answered after each service.</p></li> <li><p>There's a primary check-list table, with all possible questions.</p></li> </ol>  <p>I was wondering if there was a better solution, or additional modifications to be made before I start developing.  Also, if you have done something similar, I would really appreciate your input.</p>  <pre><code>TABLE vehicle   id   make_id  TABLE service   id   vehicle_id   schedule_date  TABLE checklist   id   question (text)   type_id  (some are check-boxes, some are drop-downs)  TABLE checklist_set (user who requests the service, must also select related checks from check-list)   id   vehicle_id   checklist_question_id  TABLE checklist_response (table to hold all answers)   id   service_id   checklist_question_id   answer (selected value from checklist/type_id)   notes (additional findings) </code></pre>  <p>With this approach, a new question could be added to the check-list, and user will have it available for selection if they're booking their vehicle in for servicing.</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
