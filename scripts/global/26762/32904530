<p>In my postgresql, the I have the following column named "created" that has the type <strong>timestamp with timezone</strong> </p>  <p>So I inserted the record according to the format as such which I believe is UTC.</p>  <p><strong>2015-10-02 09:09:35+08</strong></p>  <p>I am using php Carbon library so i did the following:</p>  <pre><code>$date = Carbon\Carbon::parse('2015-10-02 09:09:35+08'); echo  $date-&gt;-&gt;toDatetimeString();  //gives result as 2015-10-02 09:09:35 </code></pre>  <p>How can I use the library to echo the correct timezone which includes the adding of the +8 in the above datetime format? The timzezone that I am using is <strong>"Asia/Singapore"</strong>.</p>  <p>The time should be printed to local timing which is 2015-10-02: 17:09:35:</p>
