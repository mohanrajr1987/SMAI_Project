<p>I started working on a project that was almost finished. It's developed in Yii (PHP) and integrates PayPal checkout and Direct Payment (Website Payments Pro) with an extension named angelleye. After changing the client id and secret related to the former developer with one of my own Direct Credit Card payment stopped working (Express Checkout works fine).  The error I receive when PayPal button loads and redirects is </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Error processing payment. Try with a different credit card </p> </blockquote>  <p>URL is <code>https://securepayments.sandbox.paypal.com/webapps/HostedSoleSolutionApp/webflow/sparta/hostedSoleSolutionProcess?hosted_button_id=[AN_ID]</code></p>  <p>This problem appears even using the sandbox. Do I need to change any configuration in my PayPal account? Thanks!</p>
