<p>I have two tables:</p>  <pre><code>tbl_author: authorId, name tbl_book: bookId, authorId, title </code></pre>  <p>What I want is to create php-based system, which is able to:</p>  <ul> <li>show authors, books in a grid; support filtering &amp; pagination;</li> <li>functionallity to add/edit/delete authors/books;</li> <li>support autocomplete for when entering a new book, so it helps to fill an author.</li> </ul>  <p>I can surely on it using <em>raw php</em>, but it'll take a week. Tried to use <em>Yii</em>, but it still lacks components required for auto-complete.</p>  <p>On the other hand this is doable in no time in MS Access starting from 1998. So I think, is there php-world solution (I mean tool or framework), to quickly create such a simple CRUD systems?</p>
