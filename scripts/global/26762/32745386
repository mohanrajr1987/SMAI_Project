<p>I have a dropdownlist in my form... The content of it came from a different model... Here's my code</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php echo $form-&gt;labelEx($model,'pr_id'); ?&gt; &lt;?php echo $form-&gt;dropDownList($model,'pr_id', CHtml::listData(PatientRecord::model()-&gt;findAll(), 'pr_id', 'first_name'), array('empty'=&gt;'Select Patient')); ?&gt; &lt;?php echo $form-&gt;error($model,'pr_id'); ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Suppose that there are a lot of data from that table, I think the user wouldn't be happy scrolling over choices... is there a way to put in a search filter on the dropdown? I think it's possible in Yii2 but I'm using Yii1 at the moment for a project so... any suggestions?</p>  <p>Also, is there a way to show both the first_name and last_name on the display of the dropdownlist?</p>  <p>sorry for the beginner question any help would be highly appreciated :D</p>
