<p>I have a slider where it should display business cards. These business cards are attachments upon creating a contact person in my system. After creation, the user can view the details of this contact and the business cards should be displayed in a slider. However, I am having a hard time since the slider is not displaying very well. I am using Yii 2.0 PHP framework for this.</p>  <p>Here's the carousel/slider in my view:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div class="carousel-inner"&gt;     &lt;?php         $cardList = explode(',', $model-&gt;attachment);         foreach ($cardList as $card) {      ?&gt;           &lt;div class="item active"&gt;                                                &lt;a href="" id="modalButton" target="_blank"&gt;                 &lt;img src="&lt;?php echo $card; ?&gt;"&gt;             &lt;/a&gt;             &lt;div class="carousel-caption"&gt;                 Business Card             &lt;/div&gt;         &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;?php         }     ?&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>And here's my <code>actionCreate</code> in my controller:</p>  <pre><code>$model-&gt;attachment = UploadedFile::getInstances($model, 'attachment');  if ($model-&gt;attachment) {     foreach ($model-&gt;attachment as $attachment) {         $path = 'archive/contact/' . $attachment-&gt;baseName . '.' . $attachment-&gt;extension;         $count = 0;         {             while(file_exists($path)) {                $path = 'archive/contact/' . $attachment-&gt;baseName . '_'.$count.'.' . $attachment-&gt;extension;                $count++;             }         }         $attachment-&gt;saveAs($path);         $files[] = $path;     }      $model-&gt;attachment = implode(',', $files); }  $model-&gt;save();  </code></pre>  <p>The view of the slider pretty much looks like this: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/pb6oM.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/pb6oM.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>It's in a modal. I can't really figure out anymore what else to do so I really need your help.</p>
