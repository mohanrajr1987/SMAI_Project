<p>I know this is unusual but I want either a cgridview that is unique to each record or an alternative way of doing the thing that I want...</p>  <p>I have a cgridview which displays a list of patients</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/XlnJR.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/XlnJR.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>when the view button is clicked it would go the view page... My view page has an operation on the sidebar called "Display Patient Records of this Patient" and I wanted it to redirect to another cgridview from another model.</p>  <p>The problem now is the cgridView displays all of the patient records instead of just the record of the patient, the user viewed.</p>  <p>Is there a way to get the id of the recently viewed patient record so I can come up with a new dataProvider for this?</p>  <p>take note that I need the id of the recently viewed patient, not the id of the user logged in so I can't just use</p>  <pre><code>Yii::app()-&gt;user-&gt;id; </code></pre>  <p>I would appreciate any help or another alternative of achieving this...</p>
