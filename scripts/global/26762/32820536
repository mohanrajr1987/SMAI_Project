<p>I am working in yii 1.x, I want user content to be added, updated, removed and other actions (update likes etc) to be done on whole page in real time. Currently this is being done when page is refreshed (this is very basic)</p>  <p>Though I am sending notifications and posting new comments in real-time by triggering Ajax in every 2-3 seconds (but this is not a standard solution). In order to keep everything work dynamically in real time I am doing a lot of efforts. But there are still many things which need  updations.</p>  <p>My question, is there is any way to improve my website in order to handle this more efficiently? Can I use any client based script library or something much better?</p>
