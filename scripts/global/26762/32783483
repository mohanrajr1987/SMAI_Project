<p>I am new to Yii, actually the problem is, many times i am facing the problem like Non-object error.</p>  <p>It was occurred due to relations. ie for instance, we are having two table called patient and facility, to display the data in admin page we have to map these two tables and display the records there. Now when we delete the facility id for any one of the matching record for patient table non-object error occurred.</p>  <p>I do not know, yii created based on database relations or not, but yii relation works like left join normally, even though as compared to core mysql concept left join gives results exact results like facility table values as null instead of value when they are not matching records.</p>  <p>But in case of yii, this will not create the facility array even empty field names, that is why non object error throws, to resolve these kind of error do we have any solution on yii framework itself?</p>  <p>Otherwise i have one idea to resolve this, have to find the file which building these joins on yii and instead of empty array we can fill the table structure ( ie field name as null or empty value) , then the data will be displayed like empty, so that we can fix these kind of error.</p>  <p>Any one can tell me where have to find that file and where i have to touch the code?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>  <p>Ex:</p>  <p><strong>I need like this</strong> </p>  <pre><code>patient =&gt;          id=&gt;1         name=&gt;venkat         facilityid=&gt; 1         facility=&gt; array(                             'id'=&gt;''                             'facilityname'=&gt;''                         ) </code></pre>  <p><strong>Instead of</strong> </p>  <pre><code>patient =&gt;          id=&gt;1         name=&gt;venkat         facilityid=&gt; 1         facility=&gt; array(                          ) </code></pre>
