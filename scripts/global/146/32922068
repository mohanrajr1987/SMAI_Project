<p>I am experiencing serious trouble wieh the Mail App on El Capitan on an iMac with 32GB memory. It grabs way too much memory. When I had my my accounts activated, it would take all the memory and after some time the machine would hang. So I deactivated all my mail accounts and uset Activity Monitor to monitor memory usage. Here is a list of what happens (time in seconds) Before starting mail time    kernel_task Mail<br> 0       1.9GB       x After starting Mail 20      1.9         7.6 80      1.9         7.6 150     21.7        26.9 270     17.7        38.4 520     21.8        57.8 Now closing Mail 555     21.8        x 680     21.8        x 920     17.9        x 960     1.9         x</p>  <p>So Mail really uses all the memory it can get (icluding virtual) and after closing Mail cleaning up still takes a frew minutes.</p>  <p>I also hav a MacBook Air with 8GB. Mail works fine on this machine.</p>
