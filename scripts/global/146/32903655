<p>My application sends many emails. The official doc tells <a href="http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/email/testing.html" rel="nofollow">how to test emails sending</a> with the HTTP client profiler.</p>  <p>But I obviously don't have a Controller for each email I'm sending.</p>  <p>How can I test my emails that are not triggered from a controller ? (I mean not from a request context).</p>  <hr>  <p><strong>Further detail on my specific case</strong></p>  <p>I'm using a listener to trigger calls to a service which is doing the "email routing"<br> What I'd like to do here, is fire some events and check what is sent (the email body, title, recipients, ...)</p>
