<p>I wrote a small script that simulates dice rolls then emails the user the results, I'm having 2 issues. Here is the code </p>  <pre><code>#Import random module import random #Import modules for emailing import smtplib import re  #Asks the user how many simulations they would like to run and if they would like them documented in percentages. runs = int(input("How many simulations would you like to run? ")) progress = input("Would you like to see your progress documented in percentages?") receive = input("Would you like to be emailed the results?") if receive.lower() == "y" or receive.lower() == "yes":     user_email = input("What is your email?")  #Defining a ton of variables for dice ones = 0 twos = 0 threes = 0  fours = 0 fives = 0 sixes = 0 #Incremented for each loop of runs stage = 0 #Start of the percentages percentage = 1  #Main program loop, runs for the number of times specified for i in range(runs):     #Increments stage     stage += 1     #Gets a random number for the dice, from 1-6     dice_number = random.randint(1,6)     #Rolls the dice and increments the proper variable for counting     if dice_number == 1:         ones += 1     elif dice_number == 2:         twos += 1     elif dice_number == 3:         threes += 1     elif dice_number == 4:         fours += 1     elif dice_number == 5:         fives += 1     elif dice_number == 6:         sixes += 1     #Checks if the user wants percentages     if progress.lower() == "y" or progress.lower() == "yes":         #Checks if the stage is at the proper percentage place         if stage == percentage*(runs/100):             #Prints the proper percentage and increments it for the next loop             print(percentage,"%")             percentage += 1  #Prints the final outcomes print("Here are all the outcomes:", "Ones:", ones, "Twos:", twos, "Threes:", threes, "Fours:", fours, "Fives:", fives, "Sixes:", sixes)  Email = 'email@hotmail.com' user_email = [user_email] hotmail_user = "email@hotmail.com" hotmail_pwd = "pwd" subject = "The dices have been rolled!" text = "Here are all the outcomes:", "Ones:", ones, "Twos:", twos, "Threes:", threes, "Fours:", fours, "Fives:", fives, "Sixes:", sixes" message = """\From: %s\nTo: %s\nSubject: %s\n\n%s             """ % (Email, ", ".join(user_email), subject, text) try:     server = smtplib.SMTP("smtp.live.com", 25)     server.ehlo()     server.starttls()     server.login(hotmail_user, hotmail_pwd)     server.sendmail(Email, user_email, message)     server.close()     print("successfully sent the email") except:     print("failed to send email") </code></pre>  <p>The first issue lies with the text variable for the email I get the "EOL while scanning string literal" error, I can get around this by using triple quotes but I want to keep the variables in the text so that wont work. The second and more important error lies with the code not successfully sending the email, it just prints the except and I'm not sure how to debug it from here.</p>  <p>Keep in mind the variables for the password and email have been hidden. I'd appreciate any help, thanks!</p>  <p>Here is the error</p>  <pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):   File "C:/Users/Austin/Desktop/Python Learning Tech Class/Personal Labs/Dice/Simulate dice rolls.py", line 76, in &lt;module&gt;     server.sendmail(Email, user_email, message)   File "C:\Python34\lib\smtplib.py", line 799, in sendmail     raise SMTPDataError(code, resp) smtplib.SMTPDataError: (550, b'5.3.4 Requested action not taken; To continue sending messages, please sign in to your account.') </code></pre>
