<p>I develop an outlook add-in using Visual studio 2013 and Add-in express v.7.7.4087. I have to deal with multiple email accounts (stores). Please see following snapshot </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/2rl4D.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/2rl4D.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>When I am sending a mail (via outlook) using this Gmail account to a some other Gmail recipient, I can see a attached file named "winmail.dat". But I can't see that file after sending it to Exchange Email recipients. Nevertheless, with Gmail recipients,  I can't see that attachment in the mail item which is in outlook sent box.</p>  <p>The same mail I sent it using this exchange account (via outlook). But it never attach any "winmail.dat" file to Exchange recipients or Gmail recipients</p>  <p>Not only that, every time when I see this "winmail.dat", I noticed that outlook replace the text of link with own "href" (so, the user can see only the href not the text I put for that URL) which I never experienced with exchange</p>  <p><strong>What I need?</strong></p>  <ol> <li>Please explain the contradiction.</li> <li><p>Is there any cure for this? </p>  <p>a. Prevent attaching "winmail.dat" to the email</p>  <p>b. Avoid HTML link text to be replaced by own "href"</p></li> </ol>  <p><strong>What I have done? and elaborations</strong></p>  <p>The purpose of my plugin is wrapping some URLs in the mail with guids. So, I modify the mail item's HTML body before sending it. I am adding some user properties too (just for manipulating mail item as per my business logics). But I remove all the user properties before sending (inside itemSend event).</p>  <p>I followed the same test after setting the outlook mail body as plain text (using outlook settings), still no luck. </p>
