<p>I've currently implemented <a href="http://aboutcode.net/postal/" rel="nofollow">Postal</a> and I'm using that to send emails on my MVC application. The problem I'm having is that I want to retrieve an email address from my database, instead of hard-coding the address I want to send the email to. </p>  <p>So to give a bit of context on where I'd like to implement this. After I create my Order, I want to send an email address to the Hospital that is linked to that order. </p>  <p>This is what I have tried, but it throws an exception on this line <code>email.To = order.Hospital.Email;</code> - It does work if I hard code the email address like, for example , <code>email.To = "hospital@hospital.com".</code> </p>  <blockquote>   <p>An exception of type 'System.NullReferenceException' occurred in   HealthHabitat.dll but was not handled in user code</p> </blockquote>  <p>I've included it in my <code>Create POST method</code> so that it triggers once the model has been saved. </p>  <p>The email address <strong>is</strong> saved as a <strong>string</strong> in my Hospital Model. </p>  <pre><code>[HttpPost] [ValidateAntiForgeryToken] public ActionResult Create([Bind(Include = "OrderID,HospitalID,StaffID,Date,Time,Expected_Date")] Order order) {     if (ModelState.IsValid)     {         order.StaffID = 5;         db.Orders.Add(order);         db.SaveChanges();         dynamic email = new Email("Example");         email.To = order.Hospital.Email; // this is where you set the email you are sending to.          email.Send();         Success(string.Format("&lt;i class='fa fa-plus-circle'&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Please Add your Items!", order.OrderID), true);         return RedirectToAction("Details", new { id = order.OrderID });     }       ViewBag.HospitalID = new SelectList(db.Hospitals, "HospitalID", "Name", order.HospitalID);     Danger("&lt;i class='fa fa-warning'&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Error!", true);     return View(order); } </code></pre>  <p>Does any one have a solution to this? I'll greatly appreciate it and thanks in advance!</p>  <p>If any additional information is needed, please let me know and I'll add it to the question. </p>  <p><strong>Hospital Model:</strong></p>  <pre><code>public class Hospital {     public int HospitalID { get; set; }      public string Name { get; set; }      public string Province { get; set; }      public string Email { get; set; }      public string Phone_Number { get; set; }       public virtual ICollection&lt;Order&gt; Orders { get; set; } } } </code></pre>
