<p>I am fighting with setting up the "from" information that is shown in the email in header.</p>  <p>It still shows incorrect email address. In the mailer class, I manually set the default email address:</p>  <pre><code>class NotificationMailer &lt; ActionMailer::Base   default content_type: "text/html", :from =&gt; 'default@email.com' </code></pre>  <p>I also specified this in the method for sending the email(s):</p>  <pre><code>  def welcome_email(user)     @user = user     mail(to: @user.email, subject: "Welcome!", from: 'default@email.com')       end </code></pre>  <p>But when I receive this email, it's from <code>my-personal-email@gmail.com</code>. I searched through the Rails app where is this email address set up and it's here:</p>  <p><code>config/initializers/setup_email.rb</code>:</p>  <pre><code>ActionMailer::Base.delivery_method = :smtp ActionMailer::Base.smtp_settings = {   :address =&gt; "smtp.gmail.com",   :port =&gt; 587,   :domain =&gt; "logistadvise.com",   :user_name =&gt; "my-personal-email@gmail.com",   :password =&gt; "mypassword",   :authentication =&gt; "plain",   :enable_starttls_auto =&gt; true } </code></pre>  <p>Emails are sent out well, but worries me that I am unable to properly set the "from" header.</p>  <p>How to do that?</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
