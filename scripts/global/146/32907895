<p>I'm trying to send an email using Marketo's API. I'm following <a href="http://developers.marketo.com/documentation/asset-api/create-email/" rel="nofollow">this</a> tutorial and am getting an error that I cannot understand: <code>{"requestId":"0000000000","success":false,"errors":[{"code":"711","message":"Invalid folder type for email"}]}</code></p>  <p>What does that mean? I've created a folder, then inside this folder, I've created a Program, then inside this program I've created this email. I can't create a email without a Program - as far as I know anyway - so I'm a bit lost.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
