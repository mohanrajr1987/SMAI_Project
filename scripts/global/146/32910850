<p>We are using sharepoint 2013 internally. Now we created subsites - one for each of our clients. I would like to set up clients with their email address so that they can follow and get emails directly to their work email accounts. My IT support staff tells me that the clients have to set up a Microsoft live ID account first. This is not acceptable.</p>  <p>Is there a way to get external users access e.g. via "organizational account"? Or any other way?</p>
