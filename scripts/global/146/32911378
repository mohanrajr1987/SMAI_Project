<p>I'm trying to get the following to work, but the lack of documentation and cryptic error messages are proving a tough hurdle to climb. I'm doing what I believe makes sense, but the DOCS appear incomplete and I am left in the dark as to what the config settings should be. Ideally I would like a minimum working sample, and/or some way to help debug where the problem lays - whether in the settings for example or the format of the email message.</p>  <p>I'm attempting to use flask-mail (<a href="https://pythonhosted.org/flask-mail" rel="nofollow">https://pythonhosted.org/flask-mail</a>) and the API can be found here</p>  <p><a href="https://pythonhosted.org/flask-mail/#api" rel="nofollow">https://pythonhosted.org/flask-mail/#api</a></p>  <p>Here is my app.py:</p>  <pre><code>from flask.ext.sendmail import Message from flask.ext.sendmail import Mail app.config.from_object('config') mail = Mail(app) </code></pre>  <p>in my config.py:</p>  <pre><code>MAIL_SERVER = 'mail.xxx.com' MAIL_PORT = 26 MAIL_USE_TLS = False MAIL_USE_SSL = False MAIL_DEBUG = True MAIL_USERNAME = None MAIL_PASSWORD = None DEFAULT_MAIL_SENDER = None DEBUG = True </code></pre>  <p>and my mail.py:</p>  <pre><code>msg = Message(email["subject"], sender=email_from, recipients=[email_to]) msg.body = email["body_txt"] mail.send(msg) </code></pre>  <p>Here is the error:</p>  <pre><code>builtins.TypeError TypeError: 'str' does not support the buffer interface </code></pre>  <p>Which seems to have from the send-line i.e: <code>mail.send(msg)</code>. What I need is some idea how to debug this for a more meaningful error message. I have tried encoding all the elements of the message using <code>.encode()</code> but this sadly doesn't seem to work.</p>
