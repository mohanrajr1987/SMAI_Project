<p>I was just looking for the functionality wherein i would be able to send email from the individual user account. For the purpose i set the email_from field properly for the email template properly in case of Sales Order.</p>  <p>Now when i am sending the email from Sales Order I am still receiving the mail from Outgoing Email Server Email ID. Although when I checked my messaged the email_from field was populated with the right email ID. Even then when i receive mail in my inbox the email is sent from Outgoing Email Server Email ID.</p>  <p>Thanx in Advance</p>
