<p><strong>Question:</strong> </p>  <p>How can I set up an Outlook Rule for received messages that have a specific address on the CC: line?</p>  <p><strong>Background:</strong></p>  <p>I am being copied into a lot of emails that have nothing to do with me, because I am in a distribution list for a team, and the team has a habit of copying every email that they send, <em>to</em> that distribution list. I would like to file these in a different folder and peruse them at my convenience, as there are so many in my inbox that they are hiding the emails that I actually do need to respond to!</p>  <p>However, I don't want to file ones that have the distribution list on the To: line, as these tend to be fewer and more likely to be relevant to me.</p>
