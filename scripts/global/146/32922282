<p>I'm trying to find a solution on how to send an email to <strong>multiple</strong> Hospital email addresses depending on which orders are linked to the Delivery that the change is being made on - using <a href="http://aboutcode.net/postal/" rel="nofollow">Postal</a>. </p>  <p>So for a bit of context, I wish to send the same email to all the Hospitals that have orders linked to a delivery. So upon editing a delivery, (to change the <code>status</code> for example), an email must be sent to <strong>ALL</strong> the hospitals that have Orders in that Delivery. </p>  <p>The issue is that a Delivery can have many orders and not necessarily just one, and because of that, I'm not sure how to target all the email addresses of all the hospitals that have Orders in that specific Delivery.</p>  <p>Also, a Hospital is only linked to an Order and an Order is linked to a Delivery - and the only way to access the hospital's email is from the <code>Hospital</code> table. Which means I have to go through the <code>Order</code> table and then to the <code>Hospital</code> table. </p>  <p>How would I go about doing this? I'm still pretty new to MVC, so I will appreciate all the help I can get. </p>  <p>I'm doing this in the <strong>POST</strong> of my <strong>Edit Method</strong> in the <strong>Delivery Controller</strong> because I only wish to send an email from there after an Edit has been made. Hence why I call it after the <code>savechanges()</code>.  </p>  <p>If there is any additional code required, please let me know and I'll add it to the question!</p>  <p><strong>Models</strong></p>  <p><strong>Delivery</strong></p>  <pre><code>public class Delivery {      public int DeliveryID { get; set; }      public int DriverID { get; set; }      public virtual Driver Driver { get; set; }      public virtual ICollection&lt;Order&gt; Orders { get; set; } } </code></pre>  <p><strong>Hospital</strong></p>  <pre><code>public class Hospital {     public int HospitalID { get; set; }      public string Name { get; set; }      public string Email { get; set; }      public virtual ICollection&lt;Order&gt; Orders { get; set; } } </code></pre>  <p><strong>Order</strong></p>  <pre><code>   public class Order     {         public int OrderID { get; set; }          public int HospitalID { get; set; }          public int?

It was just an attempt             Hospital hospital = db.Hospitals.(h =&gt; h.HospitalID == order.HospitalID); // I was going to use this to retrieve the hospitalIDs linked to the Order? Don't know if thats correct             dynamic email = new Email("Example");             email.ID = delivery.DeliveryID;             email.To = hospital.Email; // this is where you set the email you are sending to.              email.Send();             //End         return RedirectToAction("Index");     } </code></pre>  <p><strong>Note</strong> </p>  <ul> <li><p>The <code>DeliveryVM</code> View Model is virtually the same as the <code>Delivery</code> Model, but if I need to include it please let me know. </p></li> <li><p>I also removed <strong>a lot</strong> of code from the Delivery Edit Method for readability, so if necessary I can add that to the question as well. </p></li> </ul>
