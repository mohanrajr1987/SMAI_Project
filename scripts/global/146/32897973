<p>I am creating an access tool for a group here at work. I have a sub and function that saves the form and then emails it as a pdf attachment. Works fine except I have a static entry for the recipient. I have a query (SupesEmailAdd)with a specific list of email address that I would like to substitute instead. The query field with the email address is "Semail." I'm not sure how to pull this off. Any direction will greatly be appreciated.  </p>  <pre><code>Private Sub Command59_Click() Dim strFile As String  strFile = "G:\IntranetDocuments\Perf Appraisal\InvoiceReport_" &amp; Format(Now, "YYYYMMDD_hms") &amp; ".pdf"  DoCmd.OutputTo acOutputForm, "test Summary", acFormatPDF, strFile  'Call the function SendEmailOutlook Call SendEmailOutlook("Somebody@email.com", "Invoice Report", "Attached please find the Invoice Report", strFile) End Sub    Public Function SendEmailOutlook( _  MsgTo As String, _  MsgSubject As String, _  MsgBody As String, _  ReportPath As String)   ' Get Outlook   Dim olApp As New Outlook.Application  Dim olMailItem As Outlook.MailItem   ' Create a new email object  Set olMailItem = olApp.CreateItem(0)   ' Add the To/Subject/Body/Attachments to the message then send the message  With olMailItem  .To = MsgTo  .Subject = MsgSubject  .Body = MsgBody  .Attachments.Add ReportPath  .Send  End With   Set olMailItem = Nothing  Set olApp = Nothing End Function </code></pre>
