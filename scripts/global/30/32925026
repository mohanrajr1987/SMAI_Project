<p>Suppose I have the table like in the picture, how can I distinct and limit the number of rows of field <code>cat3name_EN</code> ? I would like to have at most two rows of that column.</p>  <p>This is the query I tried</p>  <p><code>SELECT DISTINCT cat3, cat3name_EN, title from allplaces a JOIN subcategory b ON a.cat3 = b.cat3</code></p>  <p>The current query gives me the result like on the picture but what i want is for each <code>cat3name_EN</code> i would like to select at most 2 records not all of the records.</p>  <p>Note that values of <code>cat3name</code> are many</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/fA2lN.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/fA2lN.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
