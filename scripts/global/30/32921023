<p>Let's pretend I'm working on a magazine, where a Category (like "sport", "art" an so on) can contain several Articles. Therefore I want to extract all articles for a specific category. In Phalcon I usually do:</p>  <pre><code>$category = \Models\Category::findFirst(array(     'conditions' =&gt; 'id = ?1',     'bind'       =&gt; array(1 =&gt; $id) )); </code></pre>  <p>Then:</p>  <pre><code>foreach ($category-&gt;Article as $article) {     // do something with $article } </code></pre>  <p>It works great, but I would like to sort those Articles - say - date wise, ascending. How could I accomplish that?  </p>
