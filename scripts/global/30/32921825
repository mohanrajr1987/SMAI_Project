<p>I have stuck in a very complicated issue.  I have defined a table in my database that includes these fields: id, title, category, little, flag, description. for the Search part with a specific name in this table, I have written the below query in a function: </p>  <pre><code> $dsearch=mysql_real_escape_string($condition['title']); "select id, title , category, little, flag, description              from    tbl_contents              where  title RLIKE  '[[:&lt;:]]".$dsearch."[[:&gt;:]]'                    or                     description RLIKE  '[[:&lt;:]]".$dsearch."[[:&gt;:]]'              order by priority desc" </code></pre>  <p>now here is my question: when "dsearch" has been found in the "description field" in this table, I want its "Position" to be given too. for example: if dsearch=Chance and Chance existed in the description field of one of the rows, it will return the position of Chance in that description field.  will u plz help me?? thanks </p>
