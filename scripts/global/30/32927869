<p>What system allows classes that automatically have persistence of the data to a database and automatically publish update,insert messages to network when new objects of that class are created or changed.  Also there are automated gui viewers created for the classes ?  </p>  <p>At work we have such a system built on c++, sybase, tibco, qt framework but it is all custom built in house.  Is there a language or system that provides this functionality automatically ?</p>
