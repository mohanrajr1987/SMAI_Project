<p>I use actually SQLserver to store transactionnal data. We need now use a milions rows of historical data (tick data in milisecond) for 1000 stocks</p>  <p>SQL Server isn't design for this. I have tick data in CSV format, but I cant stay with this format. I need compute VWAP, Participation, TWAP, Price, SMA, RSI, ... and a lot of others indicator.</p>  <p>After this I need do a backtest on this data.</p>  <p>I'm not interrested by real time storage, only fast access/read/compute.</p>  <p>All application is in .NET.</p>  <p>KDB is free in 32bit, InfluxDB, TeaFiles/HDF5, MongoDB, ..., others ?</p>  <p>Thanks for your help</p>
