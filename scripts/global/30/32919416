<h2><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/cSzfA.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/cSzfA.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></h2>  <p>Please help me with the query. I want to get all projects_ids, that contain params and values of params. When i use one criteria (not three, as an image) - it works and gaing results!</p>  <p>When use all, I think the CPU is trying to get a record when sometimes 3 criterions are passed. Need to get all <code>projects_ids</code> that contains criterions.</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
