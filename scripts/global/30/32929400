<p>I'm new to the whole android app process and I'm trying to get my head around a few things. I am creating a recipe app in which recipes will be retrieved from a MySQL database. Users can search with a keyword and matching recipes are fetched and displayed in a ListView.</p>  <p>I will be using PHP, JSON, XML, etc... for the Webservices (as suggested by many people) and the database will be stored on my PC during development. I'd </p>  <p>The thing I'm trying to understand is that as it's a MySQL database running on my computer, would connections to the database only be accessible from my PC? Meaning that if I wanted to develop at university, I'd have to physically bring my PC with me?</p>  <p>So eventually when I export the app as an apk and send it to a few of my friends and family members for them to use, would the app still be able to communicate to the database located on my computer or would my database somehow have to be stored within the app itself? </p>  <p>How would the end user using the app be able to communicate to my PC's database if it's using a localhost connection? That's what I am trying to understand.</p>  <p>If there's any information out there that is useful that will help me understand, please share it with me.</p>
