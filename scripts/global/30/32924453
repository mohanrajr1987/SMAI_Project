<p>I am interested how the ON CASCADE DELETE is implemented because I would like to have some imagination about the performance of this operation.<br> Let's say I have 3 tables: parent, child (FK referencing the parent is ON DELETE CASCADE), grandchild (FK referencing the child is ON DELETE CASCADE).<br> Now I want to delete a row in parent table and also all corresponding entries in child and grandchild tables.<br> I would like to know which queries "are constructed" by ON DELETE CASCADE to perform this operation.<br> Is it something like the following ? </p>  <p><code>SELECT child.id FROM child WHERE child.parent_id =  'parent_id';</code>   Then for each returned result from SELECT query the following query is executed:   <code>DELETE FROM grandchild WHERE grandchild.child_id = 'child_id'</code> ?   Then the row in child table with id = child_id can be deleted.   This is repeated until all children returned by the <code>SELECT</code> query are deleted. At last the parent can be deleted.<br> I guess it could be also implemented using some join on the tables, but then the foreign key constraints could fail.</p>
