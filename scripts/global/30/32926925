<p>I have 5 tables that can contain a phone field, but I want to have the option for multiple phone numbers for each table.</p>  <p>Instead of creating 5 sub tables, it makes more sense to create one, and link it to the other 5 "parent" tables. But now I am thinking of how to link that table to the other 5.</p>  <p>My first thought was to filter on 2 subjects. A field that stores the name of the linked table, and a generic foreign key that contains the key from one of the five tables. I'm still leaning this way.</p>  <p>Next is the idea of putting 5 foreign keys into the table, and allowing them to be null. I dislike both the idea of 4 null fields. Not to mention I have the same issue with another table that would link to 11 other tables in a similar manner.</p>  <p>The third is a linking or junction table, again (I believe,) with 5 nullable foreign keys, but this doesn't seem to do anything more then option 2 with a little more complexity.</p>  <p>4th option, I'm using an auto-increment field for the primary key for most of my tables. I could switch to a UUID or GUID for these tables. I'm already set up to use UUID as primary for security reasons, but was using auto-increment for most tables for performance.</p>  <p>A 5th option is something I ran into where an auto-increment field was combined with a table name to create a new character field. (Only during creation of the table, so technically isn't a calculated field.) But again don't see the benefit of this beyond the first option.</p>  <p>Is one of these the best way to go, or is there another option I either missed, or do not understand?</p>
