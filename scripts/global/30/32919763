<p>I am having trouble with this textbook question</p>  <p>Consider the set of functional dependencies F = { A → B, B → C, CD → A, AC → D }</p>  <p>Compute a minimal cover of F.</p>  <p>Am trying to follow the simple steps to do so. First I can see there is no right hand singleton to do. Is it possible to single out CD and AC on the left hand side? Do I have to?</p>  <p>This is my attempt at it, not following the steps approach. Is it correct?</p>  <pre><code>F = { A→ B, B→C, CD→A, AC → D} =&gt; F = { A → C, CD → A, AC → D} =&gt; F = { CD → C, AC → D} =&gt; F = { D→ C, AC → D} =&gt; F = {AC → C} =&gt; F = {A-&gt;C} </code></pre>
