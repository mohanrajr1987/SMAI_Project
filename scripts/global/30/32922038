<p>I am making bunch of <code>INSERT ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE</code> to a table filled with data.</p>  <p>I need to fill table with that data AND remove data that I haven't filled (I mean remove rows that was not mentioned in my <code>INSERTs</code>).</p>  <p>What I tried and what was working:</p>  <blockquote>   <ol>   <li>create new timestamp column in table</li>   <li>During INSERTs insert or update this column with <code>CURRENT_TIMESTAMP</code>, so that all rows I touched have newest timestamps</li>   <li>Run delete query that deletes all rows that are older than the starting time of my script.</li>   </ol> </blockquote>  <p>This idea works perfectly, but there is one problem: my replication binary log get filled with unnececary data on both modes (ROW and STATEMENT). I don't need that timestamps at all to be replicated...</p>  <p>I don't want to do <code>TRUNCATE TABLE</code> before inserts because my app should deliever a non-stop access to data (old or new). If I do <code>TRUNCATE TABLE</code> tables can be without data for some time.</p>  <p>I can also save all primary key values that I insert in scripts memory or temporary table, and then delete the rows that are not in that table, but I hope there is a more optimized and clever way to do that.</p>  <p>Do you have any idea how can I achieve that goal so I can update data, delete only untouched rows and replicate only changes (I guess in ROW mode)?</p>
