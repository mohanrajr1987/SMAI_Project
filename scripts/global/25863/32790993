<p>I have application (UICatalog from Apple samples). I am using it with a framework called Lookback which is intended for screen recording. </p>  <p>I have interface defined as follows:</p>  <pre><code>@interface AAPLSteppperViewController : UITableViewController </code></pre>  <p>So it is in a straight way a subclass of UITableViewController. And it has implemented a methods as follows:</p>  <pre><code>+ (NSString*)lookbackIdentifier {     return @"Profile Editor"; } </code></pre>  <p>I wanted to investigate how lookbackIdentifier is being called and see something like that:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/BJ8jK.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/BJ8jK.png" alt="Call stack"></a></p>  <p>The question is: how to introduce such behavior as UITableViewController is a system class and I am not able to see the source of calls numbered 1 and 2 at the stack?</p>  <p>As I investigated framework docs, they recommend to implement always like that</p>  <pre><code>- (void)viewDidAppear:(BOOL)animated {     [super viewDidAppear:animated];     ... } </code></pre>  <p>As for me it looks like a change inside UIViewController - but how to achieve something like that?</p>  <p>I guess that it will include some playing with UIViewController but - how? I can't imagine how to override a single method of it without subclasssing. </p>  <p>I have only access to my AAPLSteppperViewController.</p>  <p>I would be grateful if somebody could give me a push in the right direction</p>
