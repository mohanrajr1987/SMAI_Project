<p>Let's say, I have an instance of a view controller class called VC2.  In VC2, there is a "cancel" button that will dismiss itself.  But I can't detect or receive any callback when the "cancel" button got trigger.  VC2 is a black box.</p>  <p>A view controller (called VC1) will present VC2 using <code>presentViewController:animated:completion:</code> method.</p>  <p>What options does VC1 have to detect when VC2 was dismissed?</p>  <p>Edit:  From the comment of @rory mckinnel and answer of @NicolasMiari, I tried the following:</p>  <p>In VC2:</p>  <pre><code>-(void)cancelButton:(id)sender {     [self dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:^{      }]; //    [super dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:^{ //         //    }]; } </code></pre>  <p>In VC1:</p>  <pre><code>//-(void)dismissViewControllerAnimated:(BOOL)flag completion:(void (^)(void))completion - (void)dismissViewControllerAnimated:(BOOL)flag                            completion:(void (^ _Nullable)(void))completion {     NSLog(@"%s ", __PRETTY_FUNCTION__);     [super dismissViewControllerAnimated:flag completion:completion]; //    [self dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:^{ //         //    }]; } </code></pre>  <p>But the <code>dismissViewControllerAnimated</code> in the VC1 was not getting called.</p>
