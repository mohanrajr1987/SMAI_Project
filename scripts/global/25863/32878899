<p>I've found and configured a <code>UIView</code> that works perfectly for what I'm trying to do, however I'm having a tough time configuring the <code>CGRect</code> for it.</p>  <p><strong>What I've got:</strong></p>  <p>1) <code>MyViewController.h/m</code></p>  <p>2) <code>CustomUIView.h/m</code></p>  <p>In interface builder, I added a <code>UIView</code> object and configured the AutoLayout constraints. In identity inspector, I set Custom Class to <code>CustomUIView</code>. I added an <code>IBOutlet</code> to <code>MyViewController.m</code>.</p>  <pre><code>@property (strong, nonatomic) IBOutlet CustomUIView *customUIView; </code></pre>  <p>In <code>MyViewController</code>'s <code>viewDidLoad</code>, I use these commands to add <code>customUIView</code>:</p>  <pre><code>[self.customView drawCustomViewInView:self.customUIView]; </code></pre>  <p>In <code>CustomUIView.m</code>, <code>drawCustomViewInView</code> has the following line, which I'm having a b***h of a time with:</p>  <pre><code>customViewWidth = [UIScreen mainScreen].bounds.size.width - (2 * STEPPER_MARK_HEIGHT_WIDTH); </code></pre>  <p>Originally, the values for drawing <code>CustomUIView</code> were hard-coded, so I just made the <code>UIView</code> object the width of the screen and called it a day. That came back to bite me in the @$$ when I started testing different screen sizes.</p>  <p>How would I get <code>CustomUIView</code> to know about the rect I want it to draw in on <code>MyViewController</code>? I know this isn't that hard, but I can't ****ing figure it out. I've discovered <code>[UIScreen mainScreen]</code> won't get the job done for every screen size...I need to tell it the rect.</p>
