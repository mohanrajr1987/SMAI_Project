<p>I am new to iOS development. I am using swift and I want to design my views programmatically but I would like to use IBDesigner and IBInspectable to speed up my design process. </p>  <p>Right now I have a view controller with various buttons and labels on it. Here is a snippet of my code:</p>  <pre><code>@IBDesignable class LandingView: UIViewController, LandingViewProtocol {      @IBInspectable lazy var backButton: UIButton = {         var button = UIButton()         button.backgroundColor = Styles.BUTTON_COLOR         return button     }()     @IBInspectable lazy var caption: UILabel = UILabel() } </code></pre>  <p>My question now is how do I use the interface builder with IBDesignable and IBInspectable? Do I need to add a .xib? I saw some other questions mentioning that I need to use a playground, but I was trying to avoid using that, i essentially wanted to know if it is possible to view my entire viewcontroller?</p>  <p>Thank you,</p>
