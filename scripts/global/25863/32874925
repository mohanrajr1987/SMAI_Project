<p>In the onboarding flow of my app, I have a UIPageViewController that has 3 pages (3 viewcontrollers) and I'm using a page control (the 3 dots) to show the user which page he is on. The page control is created by using the following delegate methods:</p>  <pre><code>- (NSInteger)presentationCountForPageViewController:(UIPageViewController *)pageViewController {     return 3; }  - (NSInteger)presentationIndexForPageViewController:(UIPageViewController *)pageViewController {      return 0; } </code></pre>  <p>When the user gets to the third view controller, aka the 3rd page of the UIPageViewController, I want the Page Control (the 3 dots) to disappear and for the 3rd page to fill the entire screen.</p>  <p>How can I do this? </p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
