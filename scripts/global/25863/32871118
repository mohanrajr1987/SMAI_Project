<p>When presenting a ViewController modally with a storyboard segue, the previous ViewController bleeds through. </p>  <p>UIViewController B presents UIViewController C modally. Both of them have <code>UIScrollView</code> (if that matters). When I get to ViewController C, it's almost as though the the entire view is just a tiny bit smaller so that the previous ViewController bleeds through. It looks something like this:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/W3wpKQH.png" alt="1"></p>  <p>The bottom light grey is part of the previous controller. The way I actually confirmed it was the previous view controller is I added this method to it:</p>  <pre><code>- (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event {    NSLog(@"I'm being touched!"); } </code></pre>  <p>This only occurs in iOS 7 and not on iOS 8.</p>
