<p>Using the diagram below as a reference, I'm trying to go from controller A to controller B-2 when the users pushes a button.</p>  <p>I'm fairly new to iOS so I'm having some problems. If I push the B-2 controller or create a segue the hierarchy is not respected and the B-2 controller is not inside the navigation controller (B).</p>  <p>I want the user to still have the navigation funcionalities and to still be able to go back to controller B-1 using the back button.</p>  <p>Controllers A &amp; B are both under the same Tab controller  (Z)</p>  <p>How can I achieve this?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/M6cwI.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/M6cwI.jpg" alt="Diagram"></a></p>
