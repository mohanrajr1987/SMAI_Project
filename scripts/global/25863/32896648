<p>I added a custom UIView to a UIViewController and after some code in the view, I want to remove this view from the UIViewController, but I am not sure how to notify the UIViewController of the UIView's removal.</p>  <p>I am using this method to exit from within the UIView</p>  <pre><code>-(void)exit{     [self removeFromSuperview]; } </code></pre>  <p>Do I need to set a listener? Any help is appreciated</p>  <hr>  <p><strong>I posted a detailed solution. Thanks Rage, Bill L, and FreeNickname</strong></p>
