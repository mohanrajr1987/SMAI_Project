<p>My application has integrated remote push notification service. Its working fine. I want to update the user unread notification count inside my app. If the notification received when the app is in background, and if user launched the app without clicking the notification instead of clicking the notification, user open the app using tapping the app icon (app has not closed just running in the background). So because of user still havent read the notification my viewcontroller should update the new notification count.</p>  <p>How can I do this? Please help me</p>
