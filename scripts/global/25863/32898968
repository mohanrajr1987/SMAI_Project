<p>I am trying to get the familiar "translucent overlay" effect. I am using the .OverCurrentContext presentation style, and the presented VC has a view with 0.5 alpha, set in storyboard.</p>  <p>When I use the (default) transition of .CoverVertical, all is good. When I use .CrossDissolve (which is what I want) the presented view is opaque. When I check the presented view's alpha, it has somehow become 1. Why? Where do I intercede to prevent this?</p>  <pre><code>let vc = self.storyboard!.instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier("Overlay")! vc.modalPresentationStyle = .OverCurrentContext vc.modalPresentationStyle = .CrossDissolve self.presentViewController(vc, animated:true, completion:nil) </code></pre>
