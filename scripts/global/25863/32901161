<p>I am a newbie in iOS development. Now I need to develop a small app that calls another app with its API. There two Views A and B. The button on View A will call the API to open the external app and get a set of data, then the data will be shown on View B. I used to create a navigationView and call the API in "viewDidLoad" but didn't work. The main problem is that when the external app is open it will not jump back to my own app. What kind of method should I use to build the connection between the two views, and where should I call the API and how to jump back?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
