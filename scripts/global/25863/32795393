<p>I've written an iOS Application which has a standard View Controller as the primary view controller. This view controller then segues to a SWRevealViewController which has a sw_front and sw_back view controller attached to it using SWRevealViewControllerSeguePushController segues. I want to be able to dismiss the front view controller however calling [self dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:nil]; has no effect on the front view controller. I want to be able to dismiss all views and return to the initial view controller.</p>  <p>I'm able to dismiss the SWRevealViewController although the front view controller remains open in the background. Is there any way in which I can dismiss the front view and the SWRevealViewController so they aren't able to stay open and continue running code in the background and using system resources?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
