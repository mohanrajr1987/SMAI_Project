<p>OK, I am a NOOB with iPhone and have a simple question I assume. I have found a lot of help out there but am not sure what I am doing wrong. I simply want to take a photo with the camera then move to the next view controller after successful capture and place it in an image view. Got most of this code from here so thanks already but can not seem to get it to work, all different kinds of errors I do not understand. I think it must be that I am killing the view controller then trying to re-instantiate it but am a little lost Please Help.</p>  <pre><code>#import "ViewController.h"  @interface ViewController ()  @end  @implementation ViewController  - (IBAction)TakePhoto:(id)sender{     picker = [[UIImagePickerController alloc] init];     picker.delegate = self;     [picker setSourceType:UIImagePickerControllerSourceTypeCamera];     [self presentViewController:picker animated:YES completion:NULL]; }  - (void) imagePickerController:(UIImagePickerController *)picker didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo:(NSDictionary *)info{     image = [info objectForKey:UIImagePickerControllerOriginalImage];     [imageView setImage:image];     [self dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:NULL];      NSString *submit = @"viewControllerSubmit";     UIStoryboard *mainstoryboard = [UIStoryboard storyboardWithName:submit bundle:nil];     UIViewController *vc = [mainstoryboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:submit];     [self presentViewController:vc animated:YES completion:nil]; }  - (void) imagePickerControllerDidCancel:(UIImagePickerController *)picker{     [self dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:NULL]; }  - (void)viewDidLoad {     [super viewDidLoad];     // Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib. }  - (void)didReceiveMemoryWarning {     [super didReceiveMemoryWarning];     // Dispose of any resources that can be recreated. }  @end </code></pre>  <p>As you can see I have tried a few things. I have tried searching for the errors but tried other things to no avail. Any assistance would be great, thanks in advance.</p>  <h1>EDITED VERSION and FULL CODE BELOW HERE</h1>  <p>==================================================================== OK, I am posting my full code. I can get the form to go from one to the next as I was simply calling the storyboard name wrong. However I can not get the image I take from the camera to show up on the next form. All I get is an empty ImageView without any errors. What am I missing? Please help been working on this for days and have researched a ton.</p>  <p>First View Controller .M File</p>  <pre><code>#import "ViewController.h" #import "ViewControllerSubmit.h"  @interface ViewController ()  @end  @implementation ViewController{  UIImage *newImage;  }   - (IBAction)TakePhoto:(id)sender{     picker = [[UIImagePickerController alloc] init];     picker.delegate = self;     [picker setSourceType:UIImagePickerControllerSourceTypeCamera];     [self presentViewController:picker animated:YES completion:nil]; //nil from Null }  - (void)prepareForSegue:(UIStoryboardSegue *)segue sender:(id)sender{     if ([segue.identifier isEqualToString:@"ViewControllerSubmit"]){         ViewControllerSubmit *destViewController = segue.destinationViewController;         destViewController.theNewImage = newImage;     } }  - (void) imagePickerController:(UIImagePickerController *)picker didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo:(NSDictionary *)info{     newImage = [info objectForKey:UIImagePickerControllerOriginalImage]; [self dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:NULL];      NSString *submit = @"ViewControllerSubmit";     NSString *main = @"Main";     UIStoryboard *mainstoryboard = [UIStoryboard storyboardWithName:main bundle:nil];     UIViewController *vc = [mainstoryboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:submit];     [self presentViewController:vc animated:YES completion:nil];  }   - (void) imagePickerControllerDidCancel:(UIImagePickerController *)picker{     [self dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:NULL]; }   - (void)viewDidLoad {     [super viewDidLoad];     // Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib. }  - (void)didReceiveMemoryWarning {     [super didReceiveMemoryWarning];     // Dispose of any resources that can be recreated. }  @end </code></pre>  <p>First View Controller .H File</p>  <pre><code>#import &lt;UIKit/UIKit.h&gt;  @interface ViewController : UIViewController &lt;UIImagePickerControllerDelegate, UINavigationControllerDelegate&gt;{     UIImagePickerController *picker; }   @end </code></pre>  <p>Second View Controller .M File</p>  <pre><code>#import "ViewControllerSubmit.h"  @interface ViewControllerSubmit () @property (weak, nonatomic) IBOutlet UIImageView *_image;  @end  @implementation ViewControllerSubmit  - (void)viewDidLoad {     [super viewDidLoad];     // Do any additional setup after loading the view.     self._image.image = self.theNewImage;    }  - (void)didReceiveMemoryWarning {     [super didReceiveMemoryWarning];     // Dispose of any resources that can be recreated. }  @end </code></pre>  <p>Second View Controller .H File</p>  <pre><code>#import "ViewController.h"  @interface ViewControllerSubmit : ViewController @property (strong, nonatomic) UIImage *theNewImage;  @end </code></pre>  <p>Again, no error, the camera comes up, it takes the picture and when I click 'Use Photo' the second View Controller pops up but the image view does not show the image captured.</p>  <p>What am I missing? Any help would be great and again please forgive the ignorance, I am new to iPhone.</p>
