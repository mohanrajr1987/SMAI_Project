<p>I have an application on iPhone who has much content in viewcontroller. Generally the main content is form. My problem is that I put up keyboard and want to type some value to form fields much of content is invisible. I want to scroll this content when keyboard appear. How can I do this? My view does'n have scroll view however I tried do this but it don't works.</p>  <p>All hints I found so far concern how to put up used textbox, but this is not my assumption. </p>
