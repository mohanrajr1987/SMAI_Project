<p>I have this 2 "Loops" in my App between my ViewController.</p>  <p>First Loop is the Game-loop. At first VC my Level is displayed. The second VC is my Game Screen and if the game is finished, my third VC will appear with bonus point, stars, and so on.</p>  <p>The second "Loop" are just three VC with swiping.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/hYU7s.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/hYU7s.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Ok, where is now the problem? i have problems with the deallocations. for example, overtime i swipe, my locations are going up in s√≠nstruments, the curve is getting higher and higher...</p>  <p>also my game loop. i can't deallocate the vc before. </p>  <p>i think i didn't understand correctly how [self dismissViewControllerAnimated:NO completion:nil]; works.</p>  <p>is it right, that this method is always sent to the parent vc, and the parent vc deallocate the vc where i execute this method?</p>  <p>is the parent vc my initial vc?</p>  <p>how can i dismiss and deallocate my view controllers correctly in my "loops"?  </p>  <p>now, my allocing curve in instruments is getting higher and higher at each level, and about level 18-21 my app is crashing, i think because of too much allocations. </p>  <p>can anyone tell me hoe i can solve my problems?</p>
