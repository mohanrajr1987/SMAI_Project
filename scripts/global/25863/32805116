<p>I have an unwind segue question.</p>  <p>I have two View Controller, "main" and "about". I want to achieve the following simple actions:</p>  <ol> <li>When a button (A) on "main" is clicked, the "about" view is showed.</li> <li>When a button (B) on "about" is clicked, the "about" view is gone and the "main" view is returned.</li> </ol>  <p>I didn't use any navigation controller. What I did is as follows:</p>  <ol> <li>Create a "Show" segue from button (A) to "about".</li> <li>Customize the UIViewController of "about" view controller and create an IBAction func unwind(s: UIStoryboardSegue). Only one line of code is in it: print("unwind")</li> <li>Control-drag from button (B) to "exit" button on "about" view controller and link up the unwind segue to the unwind func.</li> </ol>  <p>However, when I click button (B) on "about" view, the print is not triggered, nor the "about" view unwinds.</p>  <p>I have no idea what's going on here and would like some help. I am on xcode 7, using swift 2 under iOS 9.</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
