<p>I have a <code>UITableView</code> Class which controls the items in my custom cell. With one of these items I need to respond by moving to my <code>LoginView</code>. I set up a <code>UITapGestureRecognizer</code> with the selector called <code>priceClick()</code>. In this method I need to call <code>buildNewLoginView</code> but obviously can't use a segue so I call a class in my <code>MenuViewController</code> to show <code>LoginView</code>.</p>  <pre><code>func priceClick() {     MenuViewController.buildNewLoginView(MenuViewController) } </code></pre>  <p>This just throws an error </p>  <blockquote>   <p>'Expression resolves to an used function'</p> </blockquote>  <p>What can I change so that I can call this method?</p>
