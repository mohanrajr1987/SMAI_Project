<p>I am using a <code>pageViewController</code> embedded in a <code>Container</code> in a <code>ViewController</code> used as a Home Screen. The ViewController have several buttons to open other ViewController.</p>  <p>I am looking for a way to update the <code>pageViewController</code> current page based on a value of a variable set when saving data at a different ViewController. I managed to get the value to the Home <code>ViewController</code> and able to almost made it work with this code at the <code>viewDidLoad</code> for the Home <code>ViewController</code></p>  <pre><code>if currentStatPage &gt; 0 {     startVC = self.viewControllerAtIndex(currentStatPage) as ViewControllerDashboardCharts     viewControllers = NSArray(object: startVC)     self.pageViewController.setViewControllers(viewControllers as! [UIViewController], direction: .Forward, animated: true, completion: nil)     var pageController = UIPageControl.appearance()     pageController.currentPage = currentStatPage  } </code></pre>  <p>The problem is that is I select the button that will show page #3 ( sending the value 2), the pages in the pageViewController get out of order ( the 1st page gets to the place of the 2nd page).</p>  <p>Is there a way to preload the 6 ViewControllers (dynamically created) and programmatically move to the specific one?</p>  <p>Any help would be greatly appreciated, Thanks.</p>
