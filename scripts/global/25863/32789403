<p>I have a very complex, but static, <strong>ViewController A</strong> that presents <strong>ViewController B</strong> over it. <strong>B</strong> completely covers <strong>A</strong> and is opaque.</p>  <p>I noticed that if I present <strong>B</strong> using <code>UIModalPresentationOverFullScreen</code> my FPS drops to around 30, but if I use <code>UIModalPresentationFullScreen</code> the FPS is closer to the desired 60. I know since <strong>B</strong> is being presented opaquely over <strong>A</strong> that it doesn't make sense to use the former style, <em>but</em> I'm curious to know why the rendering engine is still struggling since as far as it knows, it doesn't need to render/update <strong>A</strong>.</p>
