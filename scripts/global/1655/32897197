<p>I am working on an ASP.NET project. It has all the code in server side tags Grid view is implemented for fetching records, so now we have a requirement as listed below:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>for each record or each single table row we have to make an http request and check a condition of the record if it satisfies then the record should display and not otherwise. SO I thought to make a stored procedure and do everything in stored procedure and return only 10 filtered records at a time or on paging.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Can anyone suggest me something?</p>
