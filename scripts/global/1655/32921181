<p>I have a page in which I am using telerik's gridview control to show some data. I have an option where double click on a cell opens an autocompletebox with multiple features. I want the selected value from the popup to be displayed in the cell back in view mode.</p>  <p>Below is the code I am trying to achieve that.</p>  <pre><code>        Dim editingTemplateObject = DirectCast(AgentMasterGrid.CurrentCell.GetEditingElement, AutoCompleteBox)     AgentMasterGrid.CurrentCell.Value = editingTemplateObject.Value </code></pre>  <p>I step through the code, and I can see that currentcell's value is getting changed properly. But this change is not getting reflected in view mode. </p>  <p>I am unable to figure out how to get the gridview to update the cell template, based on the new value. Actually, I am unable to find the view template reference itself, so even manual selection won't work.</p>  <p>I also tried removing that autocomplete box, and using a normal textbox, but even that had same problem. </p>
