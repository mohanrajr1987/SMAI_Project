<p>I have a GridView and in its RowDataBound event I am trying to set the format of a column to "dd MMM yyyy". I first check if RowType is DataRow,  My code is as shown below : </p>  <pre><code>        If e.Row.RowType = System.Web.UI.WebControls.DataControlRowType.DataRow Then         Dim ColCount As Integer         ColCount = e.Row.Cells.Count          For looper = 0 To ColCount - 1              Dim cell As TableCell = e.Row.Cells(looper)             ' For now I have hardcoded the Table Name             Dim TempTabName As String = "STAFF"             Dim TempColName As String             Dim TempColType As String              Dim CurrCol As BoundField = DirectCast(DirectCast(e.Row.Cells(looper), DataControlFieldCell).ContainingField, BoundField)             ' Extracting Column Name             TempColName = CurrCol.HeaderText             ' Extracting Column Type (varchar, datetime etc)             TempColType = GetColType(TempTabName, TempColName)              ' Depending on Column Type Set Format             ' Depending on Column Type Set Format             Select Case TempColType                 Case "varchar"                     status.Text = "We are at varchar"                 Case "nvarchar"                     status.Text = "We are at nvarchar"                 Case "char"                     status.Text = "We are at char"                 Case "datetime"                     status.Text = "We are at datetime"                     CurrCol.DataFormatString = "{0:dd/MM/yy}"                                     Case "date"                     status.Text = "We are at date"                 Case "time"                     status.Text = "We are at time"                 Case "float"                     status.Text = "We are at float"             End Select         Next     End If </code></pre>  <p>When I run this code on line CurrCol.DataFormatString I get the error "Exception of type 'System.NotSupportedException' occurred in System.Web.dll but was not handled in user code". Additional Info: Specified method is not supported</p>  <p>Can someone please tell me what I am doing wrong? Or can someone please explain with some sample code of how to achieve the same?</p>
