<p>I have a created a gridview and added a checkbox in item template. This grid has few columns along with <code>DataKey (primary key)</code>.  Due to performance gain, this grid will fetch the next set of recrods on each page change based on the page number click.  So that is done. </p>  <p>Now when user selects a checkbox in page one and then go to page 2 and coming back  to page one, then user will not see the checkbox checked as the user did earlier. </p>  <p>So is there a good way to persist the checkbox when user move page to page?  </p>  <p>This checkbox be used as a flag to select the rows that can be deleted later by a button outside the grid. </p>
