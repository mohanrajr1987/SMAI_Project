<p>I have gridview and the number of cells are around 42 (7*6). -- It's a calendar. </p>  <p>I want to select multiple cells in gridview with following gesture : 1) long click on position 0 -> change color of position 0.  2) then, drag to position 10 -> change colors of all cells located between position 0 and position 10. (cell color of postion 0, 1, 2... and 10 should be changed) </p>  <p>I implemented this with following way : 1) add a framelayout to each cell 2) implement the gesture and call setforeground of the framelayout during dragging.  </p>  <p>This way works and I can see the color of the all cells are changed. </p>  <p>However, although I call setforeground of position 0, it does not change.  color of only cell position 0 is not changed. </p>  <p>I saw many questions about position 0 of grid view. </p>  <p>In summary, setforground of framelayout in position 0 does not work.  If you have another solution to implement my scenario, please let me know. </p>
