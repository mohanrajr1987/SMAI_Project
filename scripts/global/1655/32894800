<p>I have a website which using masterpages with Top, Left and the content to the right. From the left i make a query and i'm showning records from a database in the right using a gridview. The gridview has an image with hyperlink and i want when the user clicks the image to show the item details in a seperate page. The link is correct showing <a href="http://mysite/details.aspx?item=xxxx" rel="nofollow">http://mysite/details.aspx?item=xxxx</a> but the page is not loading in the right and i'm still see the same page. When i right click to the image and select open in new window the its shows fine. What i'm doing wrong?</p>
