<p>I have a Gridview that is colored on OnRowDataBound event according to a #Colorcode taken from an not visible Cell in the Grid. That works perfectly!</p>  <p>But once you select a row, the coloring is lost and the selected row is NOT highlighted anymore, as it did before I added the OnRowDataBound event. In order to get the rows colored again I do a DataBind() on the GridView; to highlight the selected row I manually set the Backcolor. This works for the colored rows, but does not highlight the selected row.</p>  <p>How do I achieve that the selected row is highlighted?
