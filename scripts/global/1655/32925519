<p>What's the easiest way to layout items like this? So basically 2 item types - one half a width of a screen (minus padding) and one full width. I'd like to use one layout rather than using gridview for every segment.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/crlHQ.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/crlHQ.png" alt="layout to get"></a></p>  <p>Of course I could inflate the view consisting of 2 items and then switch by the type of the element - while the layout stays the same (basically a simple listview should do). But this seems unnatural. There is also something like <em>StaggeredGridLayoutManager</em> but this smells also for this simple use case.</p>
