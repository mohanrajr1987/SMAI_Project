<p>I have 3TB data, about 10Billion records, every record has 6 columns such as: <code>name,location,ip,count,behavior,type.</code> I have 10 linux servers, each server has 16 cores, 90G memory and 5TB hard disk space.</p>  <p>I wanna very quickly finish the indexing, so how should I design the ElasticSearch index structure please, such as: How many shards would be better? and, should I use multiple types, i.e the same index has multiple types. Is multiple types helpful for the indexing performance please.</p>
