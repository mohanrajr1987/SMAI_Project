<p>How do you use sort in re-rank query? From what I have tried it always sorts on main query. If I add sort on a field in the re-rank query I am expecting it to sort only the top <code>n</code> documents based on the sort field. But I think it is sorting on all the docs from the main query.</p>  <p>Is this an expected behavior?</p>  <p>Is there a way to do something like:  </p>  <pre><code>q=hello+world&amp;rq={!rerank reRankQuery=$rqq reRankDocs=100}&amp;rqq=sort={!func}myFunc() desc ?   </code></pre>  <p>or even as simple as </p>  <pre><code>http://localhost:8983/solr/0/select?q=edgengram:abc&amp;wt=json&amp;indent=true&amp;debugQuery=true&amp;    rq={!rerank reRankQuery=$rqq reRankDocs=20}&amp;rqq=sort=some_field desc </code></pre>  <p>I am not able to get the last part right. I don't think my <code>rqq</code> is right.</p>
