<p>I want to create an index in elasticsearch that has a field of weighted keywords list, so when I search by term in this keywords -  it will give better scores to those documents that has this key with higher weight?</p>  <p>For instance:</p>  <h2>Doc1</h2>  <p>"id" : "111" "keywords" : "house"(20), "dog"(2)</p>  <h2>Doc2</h2>  <p>"id" : "222" "keywords" : "house"(3), "dog"(40)</p>  <p>I want when searching "dog" to get doc2 with higher score.</p>  <p>How would you build the mapping and the query?</p>  <p>Note that it's different than searching with regular boost, as the boost per each term is different per document.</p>
