<p>We are using Lucid works Solr version 4.6.</p>  <p>Our source system basically stores data into two destination systems (one through real time and another thorough the batch mode). Data is ingested into Solr through the real time route.</p>  <p>We need to periodically synch the data ingested in Solr with the data ingested into the batch system.</p>  <p>The design we are currently trying to evaluate is to import the data from batch system into another Solr collection, but really not sure how to sync both collections (i.e the one with realtime data and second is through batch import). </p>  <p>I read through data import handlers but this will override the existing data in Solr. Is there any way in which we can identify the delta between the two collections and ingest that only.</p>
