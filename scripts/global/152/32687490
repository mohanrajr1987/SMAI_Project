<p>I am reviewing the similarity calculations performed by the DefaultSimilarity class in Lucene invoked by Solr. Specifically, I am not clear about field normalization as to how its calculated when the Solr query doesn't reference a specific field. </p>  <pre><code>norm(t,d) = doc.getBoost() · lengthNorm · ∏ f.getBoost() .... field f in d named as t     where    doc.getBoost() = document's boost specified at index time   f.getBoost()   = field's boost specified at index time   lengthNorm     = number of terms/tokens in the field </code></pre>  <p>My question is, if a solr query is specified as - </p>  <pre><code>/select?q=indian cricket&amp;rows=5&amp;wt=json </code></pre>  <p>without reference to a specific field in schema.xml, <strong>how is norm(t,d) calculated? for every field, the term is found in? If so, how  are these combined?</strong></p>  <p>Thanks in advance for your insights!</p>
