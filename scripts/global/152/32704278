<p>I have a general question about PDF text extraction.</p>  <p>Is it normal to have trouble extracting text from PDFs? I have had success with most of my documents, but some I cannot extract text from.</p>  <p>I assume this is normal? Since there are so many factors going in to the creation, editing, transferring of documents? I guess such problems can be solved by adding keywords to the PDFs in the metadata?</p>  <p>I'd like to know if my low rate of failure is normal?</p>
