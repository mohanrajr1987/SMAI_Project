<p>I have a document which has the below data:</p>  <pre><code>Hello World and   bmw Master World  Hello </code></pre>  <p>So the documents contains 3 lines as shown above and I have indexed the document to my elastic search server.   I am using the below match_phrase query to search for exact phrase:"World Hello".</p>  <pre><code>:query=&gt;{ :match_phrase=&gt;{ :text=&gt; "World Hello" } } </code></pre>  <p>Surprisingly, It returns the above doc. </p>  <p>Point to be noted is that this document does not contain the phrase "World Hello". But 2nd line ends with "World" and 3rd line starts with "Hello". Is that the reason why the above document matches the query.</p>
