<p>I am new to Lucene API. I was going through the Lucene API 5.3.0 and looking for some tutorial blogs for the same. However, in most of the tutorials, I found the method of createComponents in Analyser class to be different in that reader object was no longer passed to it. After more searching, I found that API was changed from 5.0.0 onwards as mentioned in Lucene-5388 in <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/core/5_3_0/changes/Changes.html#v5.0.0.api_changes" rel="nofollow">https://lucene.apache.org/core/5_3_0/changes/Changes.html#v5.0.0.api_changes</a>.</p>  <p>Is there any logical reason for the same?</p>  <p>Thanks, in advance.</p>
