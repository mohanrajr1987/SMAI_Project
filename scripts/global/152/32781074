<p>I am giving a pattern "Master Servant" to elastic server search api. It returns all the documents that contain at least one of them (Master OR Servant).</p>  <p>It shows the results in descending order of score. However, I want to change that ordering to my custom logic i.e If a document contains both the words i.e. Master AND Servant, show that document first.</p>  <p>Can this be achieved?</p>
