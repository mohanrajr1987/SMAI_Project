<p>Apologies for the vague nature of this question but I'm honestly not quite sure where to start and thought I'd ask here for guidance.</p>  <p>As an exercise, I've downloaded several academic papers and stored them as plain text in a mongoDB database.</p>  <p>I'd like to do write a search feature (using Python, R, whatever) that when you enter text and returns the most relevant articles. Clearly, <em>relevant</em> is really hard -- that's what google got so right.</p>  <p>However, I'm not looking for it to be perfect. Just to get something. A few thoughts I had were:</p>  <p>1) Simple MongoDB full text search</p>  <p>2) Implement Lucene Search</p>  <p>3) Tag them (unsure how though) and then return them sorted by the most number of tags?</p>  <p>Is there a solution someone has used that's out of the box and works fairly well? I can always optimize the search feature later -- for now I just want all the pieces to move together...</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
