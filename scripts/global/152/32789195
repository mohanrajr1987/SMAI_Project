<p>Take this structure for example:</p>  <p><strong>Name</strong>: John</p>  <p><strong>Hobbies</strong>: dancing, scuba-diving, horse-back-riding, sky-diving</p>  <p><strong>Name</strong>: Jane</p>  <p><strong>Hobbies</strong>: motorcycle-racing, sky-diving, dancing</p>  <p>I am interested in indexing and querying this information. The important thing is that the query needs to be an exact match against <strong>Hobbies</strong>:</p>  <p>So, searching for "<strong>sky-diving</strong>" should return back both <strong>John</strong> and <strong>Jane</strong></p>  <p>Searching for "<strong>diving</strong>" should return <strong>0 results</strong>, since an exact match was not found.</p>  <p>What would be the ideal indexing and query approach I should take to properly index Hobbies? </p>
