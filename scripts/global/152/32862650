<p>I guess the only way to search for partial words and phrases in Lucene is by using ngramtokenizer. If there are any other ways then please suggest. I am a C# programmer and I am new to lucene and java programming. I am using Eclipse IDE and Lucene 5.3.0. I managed to create lucene index of a text file and search in it with standardanalyzer and englishanalyzer, but I am running into errors when indexing ngram tokens. I followed a few examples online and none of them work. I need a simple straightforward example of how to create index and search in it for partial words and phrases using ngrams in lucene 5.3.0. I hope, the experts here can help me out with this.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance. </p>
