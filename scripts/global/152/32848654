<p>Basically, I have an application that needs to support both Lucene.NET and Amazon CloudSearch.</p>  <p>So, I can't re-write the queries, I need to use the standard queries from lucene, and use the .ToString() on the query to get the syntax.</p>  <p>The issue is that in Lucene.NET (I don't know if this is the same in the java version), the .ToString() method return the raw string without the escape characters.</p>  <p>Therefore, things like:</p>  <pre><code>(title:blah:blah summary:"lala:la") </code></pre>  <p>should be </p>  <pre><code>(title:blah\:blah summary:"lala\:la") </code></pre>  <p>What I need is a regex that will add the escapes.</p>  <p>Is this possible? and if so, what would it look like.</p>  <p>Some additional possible variances:</p>  <pre><code>(title:"this is a search:term") (field5:"this is a title:term") </code></pre>
