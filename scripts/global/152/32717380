<p>I have to make  a "remote" <code>lucene</code> index. </p>  <p>What I need to do is to store indexes in one place for multiple application servers. </p>  <p>I can't change this on <code>solr</code>, and it does not seem possible to do this using <code>NFS</code> or other network file systems. </p>  <p>I did find something about <code>Lucene Jdbc Directory</code> but I am still looking for other possible solutions.  I'm thinking that clusters or something like this might work, but haven't much knowledge about this.  Does anyone have any suggestions for how to resolve this problem?</p>
