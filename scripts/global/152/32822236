<p>I followed the tutorial on ElasticSearch's website for uploading documents(John smith, Jane Smith etc). When I'm querying the index using URI search the results are relevant. But when using request body for any kind of match query,it returns all the documents with _score for each set as 1 i.e. without any relevance. Please help.  </p>  <pre><code>$ curl -XGET localhost:9200/megacorp/employee/_search {"query":{"match": </code></pre>
