<p>I'm working on a production scenario, currently having less data, which is now going to be in Millions.<br>Scenario: I'm having a folder that contains multiple students' data (student_id, rol etc).<br><br> Now, one student's data can be in different folders (Yes its our requirement). At current system, all the details of student are indexed under each folder. As data is very less, so duplicacy doesn't create problem right now. But, if we continue at same process, then same student's data will be indexed multiple times (depends on number of folders containing that student data), thereby increasing redundancy and index size.<br> <br> I want to minify the index size and dont want data redundancy.Please provide a simpler solution for achieving this task in Solr.</p>  <p></p>
