<p>This is driving me nuts. I have a wordpress instalaltion that uses WPML for translation. I have a extra domain for the second language that points to the root domain and loads the second language. Unfortunately I have a css problem. My console is giving me this error: </p>  <p>Font from origin '<a href="http://www.example.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.example.com</a>' has been blocked from loading by Cross-Origin Resource Sharing policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin '<a href="http://www.example.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.example.com</a>' is therefore not allowed access.</p>  <p>I have tried to add  <code>Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"</code> to my .htaccess in every possible way I can find information on - bit its still not working. </p>  <p>What else can i do? </p>
