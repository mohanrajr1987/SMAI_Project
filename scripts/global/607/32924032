<p>I have a blog that I recently migrated from it's original platform into a self-hosted WordPress site. The old platform appended a query string to URLs for mobile views. This doesn't have any connection in the new responsive site, so URLs with those query strings result in 404 errors. </p>  <p>What I need is a regex for my .htaccess that will strip off the query string ?m=1 from a URL. So, for example, "www.example.com/post/?m=1" should rewrite or redirect to "www.example.com/post/"</p>  <p>What I have so far is this: </p>  <pre><code>RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING}  ^m=1$ [NC] RewriteRule ^(.*)$ $1? [R=301,L] </code></pre>  <p>Which does absolutely nothing :) </p>  <p>Suggestions? </p>
