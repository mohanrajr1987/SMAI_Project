<p>I have created a basic Routing-system in PHP. The url is split into an array, so that i can decide what to show depending on the URL (ex: www.domain.com/page/option/param).</p>  <p>So in my index.php I've defined a div for header, content and footer, and the /page/ determines which file to include in the content-div. The routing works, and the HTML is loaded, but the stylesheet doesn't seem to be. Neither does it work when I <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> the stylesheet directly in the file (and supposedly it's possible to link a stylesheet within the body, with the attribude <code>itemprop</code> rather than <code>rel</code>) - anyways, does anyone know what could be causing this?</p>  <p>.htaccess:</p>  <pre><code>RewriteEngine On RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d RewriteRule ^(.+)$ index.php?uri=$1 [QSA,L] </code></pre>  <p>My routing uses <code>$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']</code> to get the URL, and i then remove the /index and split the rest into an array - all of this works fine.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
