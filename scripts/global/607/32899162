<p>I have several plugins that are shooting out 404 page not found errors when trying to load a page in the plugins directory.</p>  <p>For instance: /wp-content/plugins/test/test.php</p>  <p>When I go to that link, I'll get a 404 page not found error. If I go to a link for a file in the plugins directory, it will load up just fine, i.e. /wp-content/plugins/test/test.jpg</p>  <p>What could be keeping php files from loading? My htaccess is the default. I've tried disabling all plugins. Site works fine in my local development environment, but not on my new GoDaddy dedicated hosting environment. Any help would be hugely appreciated!</p>
