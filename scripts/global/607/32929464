<p>Let's say in the web root (<code>www.example.com/</code>) I have the following <code>.htaccess</code> file:</p>  <pre><code>AuthType Basic AuthName "Password Protected Location" AuthUserFile ... AuthGroupFile ... Require user admin </code></pre>  <p>This is all nice and dandy because it that requires you know the <strong>admin</strong> username and password to access anything on the site. But how can I <em>change</em> the user requirement for a subdirectory such that someone who knows the <strong>guest</strong> username and password can access the <code>www.example.com/guest/</code> directory?</p>  <p>I've tried the following in an <code>.htaccess</code> file in the <code>/guest/</code> directory, but it still requires the user enter the <strong>admin</strong> password:</p>  <pre><code># AuthType, AuthName, etc. are already set in the root .htaccess file Require user guest </code></pre>  <p>This is on an Apache 2.2 Linux server with shared hosting. This means that <strong>I do not have access to the httpd.conf file</strong>. Thus all configuration must be done using only <code>.htaccess</code> files.</p>
