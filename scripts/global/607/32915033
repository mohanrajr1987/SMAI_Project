<p>I do a lot of php but I have to admit every time I get into htaccess I get confused.  Can anyone help with the following?  Note in the following examples the names of the pdfs appended to the url's are generated dynamically.</p>  <p>User requests:  abc.com/uploads/pdfs/worlds_most_informative.pdf.</p>  <p>The actual location of the pdf is at: xyz.com/uploads/pdfs/worlds_most_informative.pdf. </p>  <p>I need to have it so when the pdf opens in the browser the user still sees: abc.com/uploads/pdfs/worlds_most_informative.pdf in the browser address bar.</p>  <p>I have tried in vain to adapt some of the other answers, but without success. Any help will be greatly appreciated.  </p>
