<p>I changed my wordpress file structure a bit. I used to have the wordpress install at the root, but now it is inside a "blog" folder.</p>  <p>So before all the posts had this type of permalink:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><a href="http://www.my-domain-name.com/2015/08/06/post-title-here/" rel="nofollow">http://www.my-domain-name.com/2015/08/06/post-title-here/</a></p> </blockquote>  <p>And now it is:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><a href="http://www.my-domain-name.com/blog/2015/08/06/post-title-here/" rel="nofollow">http://www.my-domain-name.com/blog/2015/08/06/post-title-here/</a></p> </blockquote>  <p><br />I'm a bit concerned that users have bookmarked the old url structure other sites are linking to it. Is there any way I can have someone who is visiting the old structure be forwarded to the new structure?</p>  <p>I'm fairly certain I can achieve this using my .htacess folder, but not entirely sure how that is written out. Any help please?</p>
