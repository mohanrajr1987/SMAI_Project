I want to make a site and have the url look like this</p>  <p>domain.com/players/username</p>  <p>i have my folders set up like this: domain.com/players/players.php?username=johndoe</p>  <p>inside the main folder (domain.com/players/index.php) i have a search form that posts to the players.php file so that I want to make it able to search for a player by his username </p>  <p>So -> Remove the /players.php?username=johndoe and change it to /players/johndoe that a user can view their profile at domain.com/players/johndoe</p>  <p>Thank you everyone for the help and sorry if this is a bad question</p>
