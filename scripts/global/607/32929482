<p>Sorry guys, I've googled and read and read but can't figure this one out.</p>  <p>I'm trying to hide the word "blog" from my url, only when the user clicks on a blog.</p>  <p>Currently, if someone goes to <code>www.mysite.com/blog/index</code> it will take them to the index page for my blog</p>  <p>But I would like to remove the "blog" part for individual posts.</p>  <p>For example: <code>www.mysite.com/blog/this-is-the-blog</code> <br>the url rewrites to <code>www.mysite.com/this-is-the-blog</code> and the "this-is-the-blog.php" file is in the blog folder.</p>  <p>Is there a way to do this?</p>  <p>Just to clarify, I currently have a rewrite rule that looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>RewriteRule ^(.+)$ index.php?url=$1 [QSA,L] </code></pre>
