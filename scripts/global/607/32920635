<p>I'm trying to achieve the following:</p>  <p>Rewrite:</p>  <pre><code>http://url.com?subfolder=folderone/foldertwo/folderthree </code></pre>  <p>To:</p>  <pre><code>http://url.com/subfolder/folderone/foldertwo/folderthree </code></pre>  <p>And call <code>$_GET['subfolder']</code> within PHP, which should retrieve <code>folderone/foldertwo/folderthree</code></p>  <p>This works as expected when defining <code>?subfolder=</code> but not with the following as it tries to find a folder with that path:</p>  <pre><code>RewriteEngine on RewriteRule ^subfolder/([^/.]+)/?$ index.php?subfolder=$1 [L] </code></pre>  <p>Is the above possible?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
