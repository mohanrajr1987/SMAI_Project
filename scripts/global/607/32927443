<p>Hi I am having a problem with adding social sign on to my website application.</p>  <p>I think it is because of my .htacess setup. Which is on the code below</p>  <hr>  <pre><code>    DirectoryIndex index.php     &lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;        RewriteEngine on        RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off        RewriteRule (.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [R,L]        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d        RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php?page=$1 [L,QSA]     &lt;/IfModule&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I am currently testing Facebook sign on and when redirecting back to my web application it could not return. The browser just put out an error and says too much redirecting. </p>  <p>My website is php and mysql base. Could anyone tell me how to fix this? Or any advice would be helpful? Should I look into javascript social sign on instead of php? I actually don't know how the javascript version works yet.</p>
