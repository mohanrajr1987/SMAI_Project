<p>I have a wordpress blog and i setup a wildcard subdomains into it.</p>  <p>My problem is when you look at my source code when entering subdomain, for example: <a href="http://bit.ly/1ObaFBo" rel="nofollow">http://bit.ly/1ObaFBo</a> you see all the source code inner files ignore the subdomain and the files loaded from the main "www" domain and not the subdomain.</p>  <p>There are a lot of wordpress blog like this: <a href="http://bit.ly/1JLPD61" rel="nofollow">http://bit.ly/1JLPD61</a> that i saw loading the inner files from a sub domain.</p>  <p>Can you help me on what i'm missing here?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
