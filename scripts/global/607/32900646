<p>I have a website, <code>www.mysite.com</code>, and I am giving customers the ability to create their own page on my site <code>www.mysite.com/their-page</code>. If a customer has their own domain, <code>www.theirdomin.com</code> and they want it to resolve to this page <code>www.mysite.com/them/their-page</code> but still show <code>www.theirdomain.com</code> in the browser, what do I need to do to enable this functionality and what do they need to do in their DNS settings? </p>  <p>Thanks. </p>
