<p>I uploaded a new Drupal 7 site to my server. The former non-Drupal php site used a 301 redirect in .htaccess like this:</p>  <pre><code>RewriteRule (.*) http://www.example.com/$1 [R=301,L] # force www prefix  RewriteRule ^$ http://www.example.com/main.php RewriteRule ^([-A-Za-z0-9]+)/([-A-Za-z0-9]+)$ http://www.example.com/main.php?section=$1&amp;pageURL=$2 [L] RewriteRule ^([-A-Za-z0-9]+)$ http://www.example.com/main.php?pageURL=$1 [L] </code></pre>  <p>The new .htaccess file contains none of the former Rewrite rules. The old one seems to be cached somewhere, and somehow that redirect is trapped.</p>  <p>When I load the home page the template loads, but then it doesn't load the new site's page content.</p>  <p>If I visit example.com/ I get:</p>  <p>Page Not Found The requested page "/main.php" could not be found.</p>  <p>If I visit example.com/mypage I get:</p>  <p>Page Not Found The requested page "/main.php?pageURL=mypage" could not be found.</p>  <p>I have no clue how to fix it. I see all of the newly designed site, but the main text content. I've tried everything I could find. Cleared my cache, flushed dns, private browsing.</p>  <p>Thanks for any help!</p>
