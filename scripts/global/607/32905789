<p>I installed a wordpress site. The visitors can only see the site without the prefix WWW. If someone types the website name with www, there is a "site not installed page". I am with OVH hosting and they are blaming the wordpress but I am sure that someone without good knowledge answered as the problem was the same even before the wp installation took place. If I change wp url location in the backend to www.mysite.com there is a backend lockout till I edit the database directly with the url without www.</p>  <p>My questions:</p>  <p>1> How to make my website accessible with both versions of the url (www+no www)? I want the www to appear in the address bar.</p>  <p>2> I do not want SEO rank loss due to duplicate content.</p>  <p>Please help as the customer care sucks and for 2 weeks they cant solve this problem. I am sure someone out here can please provide a few steps which I can follow and implement what I want. Thanks a lot in advance.</p>
