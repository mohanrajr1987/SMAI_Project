<p>I have a redirect rule set up as below </p>  <pre><code>Redirect /Products.aspx?Category_ID=15 https://www.trainerbubble.com/free-training-resources/ </code></pre>  <p>However, when going to the address it attaches itself to an existing page /training-products and results in this </p>  <pre><code>https://www.trainerbubble.com/training-products/?Category_ID=15 </code></pre>  <p>How can I force the original redirect and make it stop thinking its part of the /training-products page?</p>
