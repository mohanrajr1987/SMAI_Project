<p>I am currently developing my website and have added some custom error pages, namely for HTTP 404 and 500. Obviously there are many more error codes than that, but these two are the most common.</p>  <p>What I am wondering is whether there is any rule of thumb for how many you create. Most websites have custom error pages (especially for these two errors), but some have it for others as well. Just how many error pages should I make?</p>
