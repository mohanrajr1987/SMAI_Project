<p>Im serving a wordpress instance with MAMP</p>  <p>When I have the following line in <code>.htaccess</code> commented out, my website homepage loads, but no routing works at all :</p>  <p><code>#RedirectMatch ^/([a-z]+)\.([a-z]+)/?$ /therapists/$1.$2</code></p>  <p>When I uncomment it, I get the following in the browser</p>  <blockquote>   <p>ERROR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS</p> </blockquote>  <p>But each time I refresh the browser (on This page has a redirect loop) the url changes between <code>/</code> and <code>/&lt;directory&gt;/index.php</code> ; does this have something to do with the infinite redirect?  What is special about the single directive that is throwing this off?</p>
