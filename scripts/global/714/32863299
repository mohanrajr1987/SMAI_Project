<p>We are working with MobileFirst Platform 7.0 on WebSphere ND (<em>not</em> Liberty). With Liberty, it is possible to configure analytics queue sizes <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/26453955/27641">like this</a>.</p>  <p>However, on WAS ND, we don't see the properties <code>wl.analytics.queues</code> or <code>wl.analytics.queue.size</code> available for either our MobileFirst project WAR, or the MobileFirst administration WAR.</p>  <p>How can we set these JNDI properties?</p>
