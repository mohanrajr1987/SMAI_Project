<p>I want to connect to an IBM WebSphere queue as a consumer. I have the xsd of the types that I will get on this queue. </p>  <p>Is it possible to use WCF and this way make the connection between the receiving object and generate this receiving object to class? </p>  <p>What I mean is that I want to connect to the queue and by using WCF and the xsd that I hold I will receive the real object that the producer is adding the the queue for me. </p>  <p>Is it possible ? </p>  <p>How to do it ? </p>
