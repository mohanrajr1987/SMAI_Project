<p>We are evaluating IBM Portal Server (8.5) as a new platform.  New applications would be built as JSR286 portlets; not a problem.  We have legacy J2EE applications running on WAS. Can we practically deploy these legacy EARs to the same server that is running Portal 8.5?  Happy to accept a white paper, IBM documentation link on this topic.  I am not finding it.</p>  <ul> <li> Assume we have decent hardware to run both legacy EAR and Portal <li> Not impressed by iFrame/Clipping portlets as we have too much JS in applications <li> Not trying to communicate between these apps i.e. inter-portlet communication <li> Licencing issues? </ul>  <p>Many Thanks!</p>
