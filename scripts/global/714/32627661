<p>I'm using Websphere 8.5 with JSF 2.2 (mojarra).<br> A different JSF-Version is disabling the CDI-Support (<a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/forums/html/topic?id=7e0a2aae-f0be-4e4f-87ba-37c84c4db9a7&amp;ps=25" rel="nofollow">see here</a> and <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS7JFU_8.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.express.iseries.doc/info/iseriesexp/ae/cweb_cdi_integration.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>). This seems common with every Java EE Server, and i found a way to activate CDI with something called a <a href="https://weblogs.java.net/blog/mriem/archive/2013/12/10/jsf-tip-54-enable-cdi-when-bundling-jsf" rel="nofollow">cdi-enabler</a>. With the cdi-enabler CDI works even with a differnent JSF Version.</p>  <p>My Questions:</p>  <ol> <li>Why is CDI disabled, when a different JSF-Version is used? </li> <li>How "save" is it to use the cdi-enabler? (maybe there was a good reason to disable CDI support)?</li> </ol>
