<p>I have an enterprise application <code>.ear</code> which includes few <code>war</code> files.  My <code>.ear</code> file also includes the <code>jersey-server.jar</code> and <code>log4j.jar</code></p>  <p>These jar files are also part of the shared library that is mapped to the ear. I would want to remove these files from ear altogether as they are already part of shared library.</p>  <p>when i remove these jars from ear, the <code>http</code> resource that is part of the war files goes unrecognized, <code>404 error</code> and logs are not redirected to log files.</p>  <p>Can't I remove these files from the <code>ear</code>, use just shared libraries, which helps in reducing the size of the ear ?</p>  <p>Application is deployed in <strong>Websphere 8</strong>.</p>  <p>Thanks, Ravi.</p>
