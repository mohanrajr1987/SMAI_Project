<p>Hi,                                                                     </p>  <p>My product is migrating to websphere 8.5.5.2 from Jboss6 along with database branded data direct jar. During the database query, we have received the below error.                                </p>  <p><strong>java.sql.SQLException: [Product][Oracle JDBC Driver]This driver is locked for use with embedded applications.</strong>                              </p>  <p>During analysis, came across the below code                         </p>  <pre><code>((com.myproduct.jdbcx.oraclebase.BaseConnectionWrapper)  (com.ibm.ws.rsadapter.jdbc.WSJdbcUtil.getNativeConnection(  (com.ibm.ws.rsadapter.jdbc.WSJdbcConnection)connect))).unlock ("key"); </code></pre>  <p>where getting com.ibm.ws.rsadapter.jdbc.WSJdbcConnection ClassNotFOundException. I tried few options like keeping com.ibm.ws.runtime.jar in server JVM classpath. I causes many other issues and also server is not getting started. Its failing to intialize because of the other files dependencies. runtime.jar is located at C:/PROGRA~1/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/plugins.</p>  <p>Could any one please tell me, If i want to make use of the jars located at plugins folder, what is the configuration required to do in WAS 8.5.5.2? These classes are not exposed to my application. The following classloader is responsible to load the OSGI classes as per my knowledge but this is not happening in my application case.        "7-Module-com.ibm.ws.classloader.CompoundClassLoader"          </p>  <p>I have done a sample application where i can able to access the above missing(IBM) classes automatically without any configuration under the same deployment environment. I can see them in CompoundClassLoader mentioned above. I dont know why these classes for missing for my application.                           </p>  <p>Many thanks for your supports in advance. </p>
