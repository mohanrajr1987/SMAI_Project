<p>I have a web application, which uses log4j and slf4j as facade for logging. Logging is configured not from log4j.properties file, but from Java code. Application is running on three different machines using Websphere Application Server.</p>  <p>Issue is that on two instances logging works as expected. But on the third one nothing is written in my logfile. Output goes to SystemErr.log instead (there are messages of ERROR and INFO levels).</p>  <p>Initially I thought that something is with Websphere server configuration, but later I found this link <a href="http://www.webagesolutions.com/knowledgebase/waskb/waskb004/" rel="nofollow">http://www.webagesolutions.com/knowledgebase/waskb/waskb004/</a> which says that such situation can be when log4j.properties can not be read.</p>  <p>But I am not using property file for this. And configuration form Java works OK on other two instances. Any ideas what can be the issue?</p>  <p>Thank you in advance!</p>
