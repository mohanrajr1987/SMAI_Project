<p>I'm working on application scan using OWASP and got this report. what i think is that, to configure WAS to include the header in all response headers it there's a way. thanks in advance for all your answers. </p>  <p>Vulnerability:  The Anti-MIME-Sniffing header X-Content-Type-Options was not set to 'nosniff'. This allows older versions of Internet Explorer and Chrome to perform MIME-sniffing on the response body, potentially causing the response body to be interpreted and displayed as a content type other than the declared content type.  Current (early 2014) and legacy versions of Firefox will use the declared content type (if one is set), rather than performing MIME-sniffing. </p>  <p>Suggested Solution:  Set the "X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff" header for resources (javascript, css, etc.) that are directly served by the web server. This can be done through server configuration so this might involve documentation updates. </p>  <p>Affected URLs / resources:  <a href="https://css-acme-tst.usmt0520.lpc.lawson.com/sso/domain.js" rel="nofollow">https://css-acme-tst.usmt0520.lpc.lawson.com/sso/domain.js</a>  <a href="https://css-acme-tst.usmt0520.lpc.lawson.com/sso/login.css" rel="nofollow">https://css-acme-tst.usmt0520.lpc.lawson.com/sso/login.css</a> </p>  <hr>  <p>What i did so far.</p>  <p>what i did is this. i place the tags right after commented out property modules/mod_headers.so and restart my appserver but still the same response header.</p>  <pre><code>LoadModule headers_module modules/mod_headers.so   &lt;Directory mod_headers.c&gt;       Header always set X-Content-Type-Options nosniff  &lt;/Directory&gt; </code></pre>
