<p>I'm working on a jenkins job that deploy my application on websphere server. My websphere server is on VM and I'm doing the whole process of build and update of the ear files with Jenkins. After that I restart the node and the server, in the end of this process I have a success response from jenkins but as soon as I take a look in my server its still down. I don't know why.</p>  <p>Here is how I'm restarting the node and the server:</p>  <p>I have tried launch this code by calling each line from a different batch command on my jenkins job like this:</p>  <p>batch 1:</p>  <pre><code>cd C:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\AppSrv01\bin "stopServer.bat" server1 </code></pre>  <p>batch 2:</p>  <pre><code>cd C:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\AppSrv01\bin     "stopnode.bat" </code></pre>  <p>batch 3:</p>  <pre><code>cd C:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\AppSrv01\bin     "startnode.bat" </code></pre>  <p>batch 4:</p>  <pre><code>cd C:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\AppSrv01\bin     "startServer.bat" server1 </code></pre>  <p>I have also tryed by putting all the commands in a .bat file on my server and calling it from my jenkins job, like this:</p>  <p>file.bat:</p>  <pre><code>cd C:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\AppSrv01\bin      echo ---------- STOP SERVER ----------     call stopServer.bat server1      echo ---------- STOP NODE ----------     call stopnode.bat       echo ---------- START NODE ----------     call startnode.bat      echo ---------- START SERVER ----------     call startServer.bat server1      echo ---------- DONE ---------- </code></pre>  <p>call from job:</p>  <pre><code>cd c:\temp\passport_install "file.bat" </code></pre>  <p>When I perform all this calls locally on the server works perfectly. I wanna know if any of you has seen this, if so please tell how did you fix it.</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
