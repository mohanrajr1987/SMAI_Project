<p>What I would like is to run a Message Driven Bean that listens onto a (Websphere MQ7) topic. I would like to deploy my application on a Websphere 8.5.5 Cluster containing two cluster members.</p>  <p>If a message for the topic arrives I would expect that only one of my two MDBs gets the message and process it.</p>  <p>IBM states that I should set identically ClientIds and Subscription Names to ensure that only one instance is able to process a message on a Topic: <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21442559" rel="nofollow">http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21442559</a></p>  <p>Will the second MDB receive the mentioned MQRC_SUBSCRIPTION_IN_USE Exception, or will the cluster take care that one and only one MDB in the cluster will consume the topic-message?</p>  <p>Maybe someone can point me to the IBM Documentation where this behaviour is defined.</p>
