<p>We are not able to see " AllAuthenticatedInTrustedRealms" option in Map special subjects while we are mapping the security role to users in Websphere 8.0.0.9 where as in Websphere 8.0.0.8 we have it.</p>  <p>Is there any configuration needed to see that option for mapping the security roles to users for our web application???</p>  <p>I suspect that there may be some configuration missing.</p>  <p>Please help here. Appreciations for your earlier reply.</p>
