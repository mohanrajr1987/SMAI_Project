<p>Is it possible in WAS or on the MQ side to only ever have 1 active connection to a MQ and other passive connections? </p>  <p>That way I can avoid competing consumers for a queue but if a consumer fails, it would still allow for another competing consumer to connect. Like a heartbeat monitor for consumer health.   </p>  <p>Scenerio: </p>  <ol> <li>Multiple WAS Server Consumers in a cluster</li> <li>Only 1 MQ Queue Manager</li> <li><p>Require only 1 active consumer due to message processing correlation. Order of messages is not important.  </p>  <ul> <li>Anyway to send messages to only 1 active consumer while keeping other consumers passive?</li> </ul></li> </ol>  <p>I thought maybe a max open input count property on a queue would exist but did not see it.</p>
