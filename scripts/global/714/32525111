<p>we have the J2EE application that is deployed on several profiles. For some strange reason, we want that processing of the JMS messages, by message-driven beans was on the one certain profile.</p>  <p>So we want to disable the activation specification on the other profiles.</p>  <p>Just deletion the activation specification not suites, because without it our application is not starting, with some initial context factory exceptions</p>  <p>Stop and resume solution not really suites, because every time after the server restart the activation specification is active again and one day, somebody will forget to switch it off.</p>  <p>So if there is a way completely disable the activation specification on the IBM websphere server, with the working application? Or any other ideas how to deal with it</p>
