<p>I have written a login module in WebSphere, if I want to use it in application level I can add that in shared libraries, but right now I want to use it under system login under the RMI_Inbound, I can add the path of my class there, but where exactly I need to put the jar files and how to configure it ?</p>  <p>I have gone through many documents but none tells where to keep jar file or edit any xml, they all tell just to mention the classname of loginmodule like com.custom.loginmodule .</p>
