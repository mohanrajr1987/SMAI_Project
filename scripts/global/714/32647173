<p>When I try to login in workplaceXT following error occurs.</p>  <pre><code>com.filenet.api.exception.EngineRuntimeException;An unexpected error occured accessing JNDI. [Code=null]; OMFC/TheNetwork/NoOp//API_UNEXPECTED_JNDI_ERROR </code></pre>  <p>I googled for solution and found that It happens because WorkplaceXT is not able to connect with content engine. But in my case WorkplaceXT and Content Engine are on same Websphere server and content engine can be pinged in url.</p>  <p>Please help me to debug the problem. server log files shows following error</p>
