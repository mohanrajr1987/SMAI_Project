<p>I want to make an application using the default project in Android Studio for master detail view but would like to have a layout <em>(linear layout)</em>  above the master detail view to display information in it.</p>  <pre><code>------------------------- |  info                  | ------------------------- | item1 |     details    | | item2 |                | | item3 |                | | item4 |                | |________________________| </code></pre>  <p>I would like the <code>"info"</code> to not change when I click on the items, only the details.</p>  <p>Would anyone be able to point me in the correct direction on how to make this layout?  I have tried multiple variations in the layout to add a simple textview but I can never get it to look like I want. </p>  <p>The code that I am starting with is the sample project used when creating a master detail project in Android Studio.  </p>
