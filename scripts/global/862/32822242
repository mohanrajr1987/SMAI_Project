<p>I'm fairly knew to this. A recent update has thrown my 'special recent posts pro' widget out of alignment in my footer. I've moved the item to an 'above footer' container. I was hoping to make it fixed width, say 1000px, and center it within the container. </p>  <p><a href="http://www.richclarkimages.co.uk" rel="nofollow">www.richclarkimages.co.uk</a></p>  <p>Any ideas on how to achieve this? </p>
