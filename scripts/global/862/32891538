<p>I've got a fixed header element that I would like to stay fixed on scroll. The scrollable area, however, I would like it to be positioned directed after the fixed element, but I don't want to use <code>position: absolute</code> and remove it from the document flow.</p>  <p>I've created a Codepen <a href="http://codepen.io/realph/pen/dYNLxj" rel="nofollow">here</a> to illustrate the problem I'm having. I would like the red element (.top) to stick on scroll, without hiding the first list item.</p>  <p>Is there a way to go about doing this in CSS (possibly using flexbox) that doesn't require any JS?</p>  <p>Any help is appreciated.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
