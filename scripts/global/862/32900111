<p>I had created a ppt using  <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/EN-US/library/office/gg278317.aspx" rel="nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/EN-US/library/office/gg278317.aspx</a> (C#) </p>  <p>But the default master layout is a blank slide. But I wanted to include three different layouts in the master such as titleslide layout, Title &amp; Content layout, Two content layout. I tried to create a template and reflect code using Open XML SDK productivity tool. I tried including the same in mine,  it throws ID conflicts and am not able to rectify it. Is there a way to include three different layout parts to the master slide?</p>  <p>Suggestions are highly appreciated. </p>  <p>Thanks,</p>  <p>Shruthi</p>
