<h3>Background</h3>  <p>I have been recently hired to maintain a <strong>very</strong> large program (only two Activities, about a hundred Fragments, and several hundred layouts). Furthermore, most of the content of the layouts (images and text) as well as the order that the layouts appear is dynamically determined via the company's Web API.</p>  <p>Unfortunately there is no documentation.  No map, nada.  The company hired a 3rd party to make this app long before they even had Android programmers.  And the quality of the code is poor at best (even variable names are confusing and contradictory).</p>  <p>Consequently, I spend about 70% - 90% of my time simply searching for layouts and code just to change the background of Button.</p>  <h3>Question</h3>  <p>Is there a tool that one can run (perhaps in Android Studio's debugger?) that can somehow spit the names of the layout files that are currently displayed?  </p>  <p>My superiors often say something like, "Change that background texture from black to light gray."  And I'm thinking: the change is trivial, but <em>finding</em> the xml file could take an hour.</p>
