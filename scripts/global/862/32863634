<p>After upgrading my test device from iOS 8.4 to iOS9 . I realize everything inside the app appears larger and out of proportion. What is shown in the simulator is different when i build it on the device.</p>  <p>I do not have this problem in all my previous version. Does anyone have a similar problem as me? I'm trying to find out if its my xcode configuration problem or is it due to a bug on the iOS 9 since it is only recently released. </p>  <p>Below is the screenshot of what is seen in the "simulator" and what is seen in the "actual device".</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/WKALu.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/WKALu.png" alt="enter image description here"></a> <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/OoMlI.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/OoMlI.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
