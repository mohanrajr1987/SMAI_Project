<p>I have a layout:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;RelativeLayout  android:id="@+id/wordToFindLayout"  android:layout_width="wrap_content"  android:layout_height="50dp"  android:orientation="horizontal"&gt; &lt;/RelativeLayout&gt; </code></pre>  <p>On which I am programmatically adding images (images of letters), and I would like these images to go to the next line when they reach the right part of the screen (kind of carriage return). I initially don't know how many images will be displayed.</p>  <p>At the moment I just don't see the images exceeding the screen width and I didn't find a way to programmatically know when they reach the right side of the screen.</p>  <p>What would be the best way to do that ?</p>  <p>Thanks for your help.</p>
