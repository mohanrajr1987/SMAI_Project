<p>I am building a layout to print (PDFs) of letters. I understood that text fields can shrink automatically to avoid white spaces.</p>  <p>My layout body is about 10 pages high as this would be the longest possible letter. Problem is: I cannot figure out how to tell the body to shrink to one page if I have a one page letter only.</p>  <p>Thus, I end up having 9 empty pages (only page numbers) and one "real" page. </p>  <p>How can I avoid all the empty pages?</p>
