<p>How would you guys organize the layout/layouts In your app? </p>  <p>How would you change the layout when a new fragment Is created? For example, when a user hit login, how would you render the new layout for the logged in user?</p>  <p>I have read about the <code>setVisibilty(view.GONE)</code>, but Is this method considered good practice to use? Or Is It another ways to do It? </p>
