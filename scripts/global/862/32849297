<p>I need to implement a screen where the user is able to write an Application Letter for a job position.</p>  <p>The main idea is to have a <code>UITextView</code> where the user writes what he wants, with a character limit, and the current writing area is visible.</p>  <p>I want the all view to scroll up under the top bar, not just to scroll inside the <code>UITexView</code>. </p>  <p>Like this:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Gwnan.png" width="320" height="568"> <img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/nBkM5.png" width="320" height="568"></p>  <p>I also want to implement a Markdown parser for the final text and a keyboard shortcut for Markdown, any ideas on how to implement that?</p>
