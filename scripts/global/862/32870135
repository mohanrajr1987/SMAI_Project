<p>I want to create some custom filechooser for images with a special format (.blp). Using a library I can load them as <code>BufferedImage</code> objects. Now I want to create a scrollable image preview of these icons just like in Windows explorer: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Lyod1.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Lyod1.jpg" alt="Please don&#39;t be confused by my german os ;)"></a></p>  <p>The main issue is that I can't find a suitable solution which allows vertical scrolling, so the amount of images is limited by the window size. </p>  <p>I already took a look at the answers to these questions:</p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9385800/is-there-any-layout-which-works-like-windows-explorer">No scrolling support</a></p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6311772/swing-column-flow-layout-manager">No image / scrolling support</a></p>  <p>So any ideas?</p>
