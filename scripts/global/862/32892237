<p>I'm currently working on a web app to show a very simple floorplan of a grocery store, such like the following picture:</p>  <p><a href="http://shop.rouses.com/images/site/4/youngsville-store-layout-sm.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://shop.rouses.com/images/site/4/youngsville-store-layout-sm.jpg</a></p>  <p><a href="http://tech.kcrepsource.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Refrigeration-Store-Layout.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://tech.kcrepsource.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Refrigeration-Store-Layout.jpg</a></p>  <p>So I want to use very simple shapes, to visualize the different shelfs. Each shape should be an interactive object, which gets his properties from the backend (color, visibilit) e.g. Shelf4 should be red, when I load the page, the refering shape in the SVG should be displayed red. Can I use JSON data for that?  Additionally each shape should be clickable, that the user will be redirected to another page. At the moment I don't really know how to do that. </p>  <p>My first thought was to use a Map Library, but as I have no GEO data and it's indoor I think this approach is too complex for my szenario.</p>  <p>My second idea was to use an SVG, but I don't really have knowledge on creating SVGs. I have and I know Adobe Illustrator, so I can create the floorplan with that. But before I start, I would like to be sure, that my requirements can be fulfilled with using SVG.</p>  <p>I would be very happy if you provide me with any possibility on how to achieve an interactive and responsive floorplan such as in the image. Using properties from the backend is really neccessary.</p>  <p>Thank you very much in advance :) Cheers, CreaaZ</p>
