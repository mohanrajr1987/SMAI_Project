<p>I have a problem with wpf. The problem is my window, which uses some <code>auto</code> and <code>*</code> columns in a <code>Grid</code>, it is opening very slow. I've used the Visual Studio debugger to investigate what the trouble is, and found it in the layout section. The message is:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Changes were made to XAML visual tree that required the size and/or position of all affected elements to be computed.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Here is a screenshot of the debugger:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8vcxJ.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8vcxJ.png" alt="Debug Information"></a></p>  <p>What is the best way to detect the exact problem with the layout? Or are there some general rules I could follow?</p>  <p>Thank you very much, I did not experience this behaviour with wpf before, even with large usercontrols / windows...</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong> I don't use any animation of transformation to rotate controls. In general it is a very flat window. As an additional information, scrolling through <code>GridView</code>s in the window is also very slow.</p>
