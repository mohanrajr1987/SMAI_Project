<p>Just started with Amazon Web Services and want to start an EC2 instance. I need to select an Amazon Machine Image (linux distribution). I have almost no previous knowledge of Linux and don't know how to make my choice. Amazon recommend their own "Amazon Linux AMI", of course. Many tutorials on youtube prefer Ubuntu.</p>  <p>What are the pros and cons? Any reason not to choose Amazon Linux? How can I make my choice? Does it really matter what I actually choose?</p>  <p>I will run PHP and maybe later mySQL. I have an Amazon S3 bucket and planning to use my EC2 instance to get/put files to S3.</p>
