<ol> <li>I am starting an EC2 test cluster of 3-minions of type 'm3.large'</li> <li>want to use 32G SSD storage available on these machine for a pod running on it </li> <li>want to use using 'hostPath' to mount some portion of this storage to pod so that it is available for the life of minions</li> </ol>  <p>However the issue is majority of this storage is allocated for "/mnt/ephemeral/docker" not available on host for 'hostPath' use. On minion it looks like</p>  <pre><code>          $ df -h           Filesystem                            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on           udev                                  3.7G     0  3.7G   0% /dev           tmpfs                                 748M   75M  674M  10% /run           /dev/xvda1                            7.8G  2.0G  5.5G  27% /           tmpfs                                 3.7G  828K  3.7G   1% /dev/shm           tmpfs                                 5.0M     0  5.0M   0% /run/lock           tmpfs                                 3.7G     0  3.7G   0% /sys/fs/cgroup           /dev/mapper/vg--ephemeral-docker       30G  5.0G   23G  18% /mnt/ephemeral/docker           /dev/mapper/vg--ephemeral-kubernetes  1.4G  1.4G     0 100% /mnt/ephemeral/kubernetes           tmpfs                                 748M     0  748M   0% /run/user/1000 </code></pre>  <p>Here 30G is allocated to "/mnt/ephemeral/docker" and is only available in docker container as a transient storage.  I understand the EBS volumes for persistent store, however the SSD/ephemeral storage is persistent for the life of the EC2 instance and can be used for needs like data store for a Cassandra pod running in Kubernetes</p>  <p>The main issue is not being able to use the instance storage from within pods as instance persistence storage.</p>  <ol> <li><p>Configuring 'emptyDir' in pod uses  1.4G from '/mnt/ephemeral/kubernetes' and fills quickly</p>  <pre><code>    volumes:          - name: data          -  emptyDir: {} </code></pre></li> <li><p>Configuring 'hostPath' in pod uses  7.8G from '/' and fills quickly</p>  <pre><code>    volumes:          - name: data          -  hostPath:              path: /cassandra_data </code></pre></li> </ol>  <p>Major chunk of instance storage 30G is allocated to '/mnt/ephemeral/docker' and is not avilable for Kubernates pods as instance persistent storage.  What is the best way to use (Kubernetes volumes) the SSD storage that comes built-in with the EC2 instances.</p>
