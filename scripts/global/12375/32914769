<p>9 days ago we set up our web site in Amazon AWS taking advantage of the one year Free Web Tier.</p>  <p>Today we got a pretty unpleasant surprise. We have a pending billing fo 245$ for 7 days in September + 20$ for 2 days in October for the RDS MySQL service.</p>  <p>We configured the MySQL database installing it via yum, following the instructions located <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/install-LAMP.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>  <p>How come is this possible? We had to cancel the account right away. It's shocking how we were charged such a high amount for a MySQL small traffic, small space DB. They have charged us the highest rate (0.74$ per hour)!!!  Is there a possibility they will cancel that billing?</p>  <p>We are so dissapointed on Amazon. We never got any alert while configuring the instance, despite the absurd amount they were going to charge. At that rate a month would be 833$!!!</p>
