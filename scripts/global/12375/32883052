<p>First and foremost, I am aware of IAM roles and know that they would provide this feature. However, I have a requirement for a key attached to a IAM user.</p>  <p>Is there a way to limit access to resources from <em>within</em> EC2 instances (only allow if the origin of the request matches ec2 instances).</p>  <p>For example:</p>  <ul> <li>Using credentials from developer's laptop: denied </li> <li>Using credentials from EC2 instance: allowed</li> </ul>  <p>We want to make sure that if these keys ever get leaked for whatever reason, no one will be able to control resources from outside our AWS environment.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
