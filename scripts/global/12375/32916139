<p>After running        eb create projectname to deploy my rails project to amazon beanstack I keep getting errors these errors. I have never used this service before and thought I would give it a try.. Here are the errors.</p>  <pre><code>2015-10-02 17:23:50 UTC-0400    WARN    Environment health has transitioned from Pending to Degraded.
