<p>I ran into some issues with my EC2 micro instance and had to terminate it and create a new one in its place. But it seems even though the old instance is no longer visible in the list, it is still using up some space on my disk. My <code>df -h</code> is listed below:</p>  <pre><code>Filesystem    Size    Used    Avail    Use%  /dev/xvda1    7.8G    7.0G    719M     91% / </code></pre>  <p>When I go to the EC22 console I see there are 3 volumes each 8gb in the list. One of them is attached (<code>/dev/xvda</code>) and this one is showing as "in-use". The other 2 are simply showing as "Available"</p>  <p>Is the terminated instance really using up my disk space? If yes, how to free it up?</p>
