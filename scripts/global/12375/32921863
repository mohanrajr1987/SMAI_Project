<p>I want to have my watir code running headless on AWS EC2 instance. I used Headless and Watir-web-driver gem and it works perfectly fine on local environment. I now want to deploy this to AWS EC2 instance. I tried this article but it is too old (of 2011). Can anyone suggest a tutorial?</p>  <p><a href="http://watirmelon.com/2011/08/29/running-your-watir-webdriver-tests-in-the-cloud-for-free/" rel="nofollow">Running your watir-webdriver tests in the cloud, for free!</a></p>
