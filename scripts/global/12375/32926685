<p>I'm using an EC2 spot instance (my windows to ubuntu instance) to run a function that was well beyond my laptop's capabilities. The kernel busy dot has been filled for hours. Previously, I would just listen to my laptop as it was obvious when something was running as opposed to ipnb getting stuck. Is there any way I can tell now? </p>  <p>If I try something like 1+1 in the box below my function it will also turn into an asterisk, but I can open a new notebook and have zero issues running simple commands in the new notebook.</p>
