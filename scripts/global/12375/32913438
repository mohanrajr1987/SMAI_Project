<p>Inside a PHP application hosted on Elastic Benstalk I'd like to get and use the host, or domain, part of the url the client used to load the page.</p>  <p>In the past, but on non AWS servers, I have used:</p>  <pre><code>$hostname = $_SERVER[HTTP_HOST]; </code></pre>  <p>which would return <code>example.com</code> from a url like <code>http://example.com/index.html</code>. What I'm getting from my code deployed on elastic beanstalk appears to be the ip address of the running instance; it's something like <code>53.123.123.123</code>.</p>  <p>Is there a way to get the host name - or domain name - of the url that the client web browser requested from my Elastic Beanstalk PHP Application?</p>
