<p>I have a working account on Amazon S3. I have used it together with my shared hosting and it has worked well. I have now setup an Amazon EC2 instance with Amazon Linux (a similar CentOS / Redhat Linux) and installed apache and php with</p>  <pre><code>sudo yum install -y httpd24 php56 </code></pre>  <p>and added www group etc from this page. Everything else expect MySQL. <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/install-LAMP.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/install-LAMP.html</a></p>  <p>Installed AWS SDK to EC2 from composer and it worked great.</p>  <p>I can run simple PHP scripts on EC2 without problems, e.g </p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php phpinfo(); ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>But this example code is not working on my EC2.</p>  <pre><code>require 'vendor/autoload.php'; use Aws\Common\Aws; use Aws\S3\S3Client;   $aws = S3Client::factory(array(     'key' =&gt; 'CORRECT KEY, USING THE SAME ON MY SHARED HOSTING',     'secret' =&gt; 'CORRECT SECRET, USING THE SAME ON MY SHARED HOSTING', //  'region'  =&gt; 'us-east-1', ));   $bucket = 'CORRECT BUCKET';  $objects = $aws-&gt;getIterator('ListObjects', array('Bucket' =&gt; $bucket));  echo "Keys retrieved!\n"; foreach ($objects as $object) {     echo $object['Key'] . "\n"; } </code></pre>  <p>This code works fine on my shared hosting but not on EC2. I have tested to list all buckets and other simple code that works fine on my shared hosting but not on EC2.</p>  <p>I can see that the SDK is included on my page on EC2 with this.</p>  <pre><code>$included_files = get_included_files();  foreach ($included_files as $filename) {     echo "$filename\n"; } </code></pre>  <p>Have I missed something on EC2? Why is the same code working on my shared hosting but not on EC2 to the same Amazon S3 account/bucket. No error messages on the page or something else that indicates that something is wrong.</p>
