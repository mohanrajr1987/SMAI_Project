<p>I would like to deploy a <code>Yii</code> app to <code>Amazon EC2</code>. I've installed <code>httpd</code>, <code>mysql</code>, <code>php</code> and all the necessary modules. The app was running fine on my <code>wampserver</code> localhost. I've transferred everything (DB, app folder) but I'm having issues with accessing the site. I see default apache site, and I see directory structure under <strong>var/www/html/app</strong> folder, and <code>var/www/html/app/web</code> gives a blank page (or Internal Server Error). I have a <code>.htaccess</code> file in <code>var/www/html/app/web</code>. I was searching a lot, and have found informations about <code>allowoverride</code>, virtual hosts (I have only IP, what is server name then? the IP?), etc, and have tried a few different things, but I don't want to mess it completely up, and I'm pretty sure it must be some very simple adjustments to make it work, but I don't know what (maybe some settings with EC2 like elastic IP? I dont yet have that one but I'm not sure I need it). I don't have much experience, can you please point me to the right direction what else I have to set in order to make it work? Thank you very much!</p>  <p>UPDATE: I have set Elastic IP up and registered a domain.</p>
