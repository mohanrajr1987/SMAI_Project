<p>I'm trying to use the AWS CLi for the first time, and I am doing it through putty by SSHing to the ec2 instance.</p>  <p>I want to run a command like "aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress [options]"</p>  <p>But I get the following error: "A client error (UnauthorizedOperation) occurred when calling the AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress operation: You are not authorized to perform this operation."</p>  <p>I believe that this is related to IAM user credentials.   I have found out where to create IAM users, however I still don't understand how this helps me to execute this command when I'm logged into the server as ec2-user or root, or run the command through CRON.</p>  <p>I have done a fair amount of reading regarding the access controls on AWS in their documentation, but I seem to be missing something.</p>  <p>How can I allow the command to be executed from within the AWS instance?</p>
