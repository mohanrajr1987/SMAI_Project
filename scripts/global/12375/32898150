<p>I am trying to do a simple curl request to the website "www.houzz.com".</p>  <pre><code>$url="http://www.houzz.com/"; $ch = curl_init();  curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $url);  curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_USERAGENT, 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64)'); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);  curl_setopt($ch,CURLOPT_TIMEOUT,5); </code></pre>  <p>The code worked perfectly on my localhost machine however now that I switched to AWS it does not seem to be working with my EC2 instance. The page now loads:</p>  <pre><code>"403 Forbidden. Request forbidden by administrative rules." </code></pre>  <p>It worked two times when I launched a new beanstalk application, however most of the times it did not making me think it had something to do with the IP?</p>  <p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
