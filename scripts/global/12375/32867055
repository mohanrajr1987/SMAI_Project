<p>I am new to MQTT and have been trying to implement MQTT MOquette on AWS EC2, i tried the configuration and installation of broker on my machine and was able to connect and test it from client, however when i do the same from Aws EC2 instance i can see the ports 1883, 8080 listening to 0.0.0.0 ip address but when i connect from client i am not able to connect.</p>  <p>While configuring host in local machine i provided 0.0.0.0 for host and ports 1883, 8080 and on AWS server i provided the private ip for host and ports are 1883, 8080. I have added rules in security groups to allow tcp on 1883 &amp; 8080.</p>  <p>My question is what should be the host value i should use on AWS like private ip or aws url like 'ec2-XX-XX-XXX-XX.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com' and what would be the url from which i could access broker from client like 'tcp://ec2-XX-XX-XXX-XX.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com' or the IP </p>  <p>What would i be doing wrong here ?? stuck with this issue</p>  <p>Thanks All</p>
