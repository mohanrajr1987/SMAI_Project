<p>I'm developing a web application with an AWS EC2 server (using php) to access a MS SQL Server database.</p>  <p>After a long search for solutions, I found this solution to use an ODBC driver. Fine, the development went well and I have no problems to connect to database or persist data.</p>  <p>But when I deployed my application, any action returns this error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>ERRO: IM001: [unixODBC][Driver Manager]Driver does not support this   function</p> </blockquote>  <p>I really tried all that I know and couldn't resolve this.</p>  <p>My EC2 configuration is:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>yum install unixODBC unixODBC-devel freetds freetds-devel</p> </blockquote>  <p>And my odbc/freetds conf files are:</p>  <p><strong>/etc/odbc.ini</strong></p>  <pre><code>[TDS_NAME]       Description = decription       Driver = TDS_NAME       Database = MY_DB       Servername = TDS_NAME       UID = VIPS       Port = 1433       TDS_Version= 7.3 </code></pre>  <p><strong>/etc/odbcinst.ini</strong></p>  <pre><code>[TDS_NAME]       Description = TDS Connection       Driver64 = /usr/lib64/libtdsodbc.so       Setup64 = /usr/lib64/libtdsS.so       FileUsage = 1       UsageCount = 1 [ODBC]       Trace = yes       TraceFile /tmp/odbc.log </code></pre>  <p><strong>/etc/freetds.conf</strong></p>  <pre><code>[TDS_NAME]       host = MY_HOST       port = MY_PORT       tds version = 7.3 </code></pre>  <p>I run my queries using odbc_execute() or odbc_exec() and the error happens when my consult has some parameter. I'm pretty sure that the problem isn't my configuration files because I can connect successfully to the server and run a simple "SELECT * FROM table" and connect using isql running any query goes well.</p>  <p>Anyone can help me?</p>  <p>OBS: PHP RUNNING VERSION - PHP 5.6.10 </p>
