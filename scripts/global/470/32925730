<p>I am considering the xss sanitization of user-supplied inputs gathered from an Internet-facing ASP.NET MVC5 web site. Sanitizing such inputs when presenting them back in a browser is well-documented and catered for. However, I haven't found reputable guidelines for how best to handle sanitization in the context of constructing emails which contain said user-supplied values.</p>  <p>By default, I will be sending plain-text messages which <em>suggests</em> that I don't need to HTML-encode these values. However, I am concerned that modern mail clients will attempt to render anything which <em>looks</em> like HTML <em>as</em> HTML.</p>  <p>I could just HtmlEncode everything, but then we consider the input for "Company name" which can quite legitimately contain the "&amp;" symbol and I'm not keen on sending a message that reads "<code>Father &amp;amp;amp; Son Ltd.</code>"</p>
