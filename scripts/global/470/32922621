<p>I would like to create an api controller which receives my File object which contains some metadata and receive the blob at the same time. So something like this:</p>  <pre><code>    public async Task&lt;MVFile&gt; Post([FromBody]MFile newfile)     {         byte[] fileData = null;         using (var binaryReader = new BinaryReader(HttpContext.Current.Request.Files[0].InputStream))         {             fileData = binaryReader.ReadBytes(HttpContext.Current.Request.Files[0].ContentLength);         }     } </code></pre>  <p>But when I try to send these data I receive the following error message: "No MediaTypeFormatter is available to read an object of type 'MFile' from content with media type 'multipart/form-data"</p>  <p>Does anybody know how to overcome this problem?</p>
