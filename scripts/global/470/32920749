<p>I am new to MVC I made a code first database then made a  New Scaffolded Item. Therefore I have a purchase controller and a purchase view folder that contains: Create, Edit, Details,Delete and Index. I want to have two details views, so I added a new view to the Purchase folder as follows: View name: Details2 Template: Details model class: Purchase  and selected the data context class.</p>  <p>But when I run the view I made and pass a parameter in the url it says 'The resource cannot be found'. With the original Details view it works but not the new one I made.</p>
