<p>I am writing a custom implementation for IUserStore. The signature of the create method is:</p>  <pre><code>public async virtual Task CreateAsync(TUser user) </code></pre>  <p>And that makes sense considering the core interface IUserStore in Microsoft.AspNet.Identity is (which is the same).</p>  <p>However the interface of the UserManager class defined in Microsoft.AspNet.Identity is :</p>  <pre><code>public virtual Task&lt;IdentityResult&gt; CreateAsync(TUser user); </code></pre>  <p>My problem is  I don't see how I should pass this IdentityResult to the UserManager since the return type in the store is simply "Task". I have a custom logic to determine if a user can or cannot be created, so I really need to tell the outcome of CreateAsync to the UserManager. </p>  <p>Any idea ?</p>
