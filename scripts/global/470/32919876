<p>I'm trying to build my tutorial project with routing. My main objective is to build two routes which won't generate 404 error in any case. By this I mean that if the path is wrong I want routing to use /Home/Index path. I have two following routes -</p>  <pre><code>    routes.MapRoute("Default", "{controller}/{action}",                          new {controller = "Home", action = "Index"}                         );      routes.MapRoute("Second", "{*catchall}",                         new {controller = "Home", action = "Index", id = UrlParameter.Optional}                         ); </code></pre>  <p>It works fine when I use nonexistent path which doesn't matches the first route, like this -</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/V6cop.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/V6cop.jpg" alt="Nonexistent path 1"></a></p>  <p>But if it does, then I have the following - </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Uz5yX.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Uz5yX.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>or </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/aLHML.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/aLHML.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I understand the reason why it happens. However at the present moment, I only managed to find 'some sort' of a solution. Adding the following code to web.config file -</p>  <pre><code>&lt;customErrors mode="On"&gt;       &lt;error statusCode="404" redirect="~/Home/Index"/&gt; &lt;/customErrors&gt; </code></pre>  <p>However, I don't think that it is the best way to solve this problem. Because, as far as I can understand, it simply catches all errors and redirects it to the correct path, without actually using routing. So I don't think I need this global handling.</p>  <p>So could somebody please give me a hint or provide me with a good solution to my problem. Thank you.</p>
