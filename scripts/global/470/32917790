<p>I am trying to implement a search function for my application, but what i want to happen is to send all the list if there is no keyword specified and i have a <code>where</code> clause.</p>  <p>Here is my action:</p>  <pre><code>Public ActionResult classes(string keyword ="") {         EmployeeContext emp = new EmployeeContext();          List&lt;classlist&gt; asd = (from subj in emp.Subjects                                join prof in emp.professors on subj.id equals prof.id                                join dep in emp.departments on prof.id equals dep.id                                where subj.subj == keyword                                select new classlist()                                {                                    id = subj.id,                                    subj = subj.subj,                                    days = subj.days,                                    cstart = subj.cstart,                                    cend = subj.cend,                                    units = subj.units,                                    fname = prof.fname,                                    lname = prof.lname,                                    status = prof.status,                                    department = dep.dname,                                    isSelected = false                                }).ToList();          return View(asd); } </code></pre>  <p>I researched about it and it says to use 'ALL' but it doesn't work. I don't want to make an if else statement depending if the keyword is empty or no since that will make my code ugly. The <code>subj</code> property is the name of the subject.</p>
