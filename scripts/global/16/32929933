<p>Trying to write something that'll take the parameter 'name' which will be a players name, find a few stats for him and print them.  I got it to work when I was using the player's specific URL, but trying to turn it into a function is presenting some difficulty. </p>  <pre><code>from urllib.request import urlopen from bs4 import BeautifulSoup  def statGet(name):     binary = name.encode('ascii')     html = urlopen("http://www.nba.com/playerfile/",binary,'/')     print(html)     soup = BeautifulSoup(html.read(), 'lxml')     pts = soup.find("td", {"class": "PTS"})     reb = soup.find("td", {"class": "REB"})     ast = soup.find("td", {"class": "AST"})     stats = pts.get_text(), reb.get_text(), ast.get_text()     print('Points per game:',stats[0])     print('Rebounds per game:',stats[1])     print('Assists per game:',stats[2])  statGet('quincy_acy') </code></pre>  <p>I would expect that to get the stats for Quincy Acy, but instead I get an unexpected error:</p>  <pre><code> File "/usr/lib/python3.4/socket.py", line 500, in create_connection     sock.settimeout(timeout) TypeError: a float is required </code></pre>  <p>I assume this is a problem with the socket.py module, which through some googling I was able to find out was a socket wrapper, but not what this error means or how to fix it.  Any ideas?  I've tried different encodings, etc. but nothing I've tried works so far.</p>
