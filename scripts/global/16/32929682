<pre><code>def gSubsets(L):     if len(L) == 0:         print '2'         return [[]]     smaller = gSubsets(L[:-1])      extra = L[-1:]     print L          new = []     for small in smaller:         new.append(small+extra)     return smaller+new print gSubsets([1,2]) </code></pre>  <p>I am a beginner in python. I didn't get how actually the <code>return</code> at very last didn't end by getting:</p>  <pre><code>smaller + new =[[][5]] </code></pre>
