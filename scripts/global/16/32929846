<p>Code:</p>  <pre><code>file = 'C://Users/krazzy/Desktop/' wb = xlwt.Workbook() sh = wb.add_sheet('S1')  d = [[a1],[a2],[a3]]  for row, nums in enumerate(d):     for col, value in enumerate(nums):         sh.write(col, row , value)  wb.save(file +'try.xls') print('--Saved File Successfully') </code></pre>  <p>a1,a2, and a3 actually are each has output of numbers. So, a1 contains the numbers 1,2,3. They are displayed as an output in the following manner:</p>  <pre><code>Now, the # is: 1 Now, the # is: 2 Now, the # is: 3 </code></pre>  <p>Similarly, a2 and a3 have their own content.  What I don't understand is why in the excel file, there is only one number outputted and shown. So, if it was a1, then only the number "3" will be in the excel file with two other content from a2 and a3.I would want excel to display each 1,2,3 in a vertical column.</p>  <p>thanks!!</p>
