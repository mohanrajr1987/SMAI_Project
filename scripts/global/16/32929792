<p>I'm having Python 2.x problems on Ubuntu 15.04. I wanted to completely uninstall and reinstall Python. I can't uninstall Python because mercurial-common depends on it. I try to remove that and I get an error:</p>  <pre><code>âžœ  ~  sudo apt-get remove --purge mercurial-common Reading package lists...
