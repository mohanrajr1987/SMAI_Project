<p>I am creating a heads or tails program in python 3.3.5 and I am trying to make my coin flipping animation so that you don't know how many times the coin will "flip".The animation is the coin flipping. So it shows the tails side(a circle made out of * with a T in the middle), the flat side(a line of *), then the heads side(a circle made out of * with an H in the middle). It has a time.sleep(.5) so that it looks like it is flipping. I have it now so that it it has a set number of times it flips. </p>
