<p>I have to sort a user inputed list from lowest to highest without . sort, but when I try to replace two values to put them in order I find myself in an infinite loop</p>  <pre><code>list = input('Enter list of numbers separated by a space: ').split() list = [int(b) for b in list]  def list_sort(list):     while list:         a = list[0]         # random number in list         for x in list:      # to check every number in the list             if x &lt; a:       # find if the new number is less than original                 c, d = list.index(x), list.index(a)                 list[d], list[c] = list[c], list[d]    print(list_sort(list)) </code></pre>
