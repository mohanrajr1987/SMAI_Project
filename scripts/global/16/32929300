<p>I want the user to input either 1, 2 or 3. But when I test it and enter 1,2 or 3 it still runs even though the condition is False. I keep changing the condition from and's and or's but I can't seem to solve it. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>  <pre><code>def get_input():     user_input = input("Enter a number 1,2 or 3:  ")      while  (user_input != 1) and (user_input != 2) and (user_input != 3) :         print('Invaild input!')         user_input = input("Enter a number 1,2 or 3 : ") </code></pre>
