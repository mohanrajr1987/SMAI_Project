<p>I am trying to learn how to manipulate data in python. I have the following data in a txt file</p>  <pre><code>{"summonerId":000000,"games":[{"gameId":111111,"invalid":false,"gameMode":"CLASSIC","gameType":"MATCHED_GAME","subType":"NORMAL","mapId":11,"teamId":200,"championId":89,"spell1":3,"spell2":4,"level":30,"ipEarned":237,"createDate":1443314494341,"fellowPlayers":[{"summonerId":46350758,"teamId":100,"championId":157}],"stats":{"level":15,"goldEarned":10173,"numDeaths":5,"minionsKilled":48,"championsKilled":1,"goldSpent":9205,"totalDamageDealt":48752,"totalDamageTaken":23464,"team":200,"win":true,"largestMultiKill":1,"physicalDamageDealtPlayer":9064,"magicDamageDealtPlayer":35714,"physicalDamageTaken":18944,"magicDamageTaken":4005,"timePlayed":1831,"totalHeal":4129,"totalUnitsHealed":5,"assists":24,"item0":3401,"item1":2049,"item2":3117,"item3":3068,"item4":3075,"item5":1028,"item6":3340,"magicDamageDealtToChampions":9062,"physicalDamageDealtToChampions":3348,"totalDamageDealtToChampions":12411,"trueDamageDealtPlayer":3974,"trueDamageTaken":514,"wardKilled":1,"wardPlaced":16,"totalTimeCrowdControlDealt":104,"playerRole":2,"playerPosition":4}]} </code></pre>  <p>My end goal is to be able to display a specific piece of information from the "stats" dictionary.</p>  <p>When I run the following code</p>  <pre><code>import json matches = open('testdata.txt', 'r') output = matches.read() data=json.loads(output) display = data["games"] print("Info: " + str(display)) </code></pre>  <p>The output is everything that corresponds to the "games" key as I would expect.</p>  <p>When I try </p>  <pre><code>import json matches = open('testdata.txt', 'r') output = matches.read() data=json.loads(output) display = data["games"]["stats"] print("Info: " + str(display)) </code></pre>  <p>I receive: <code>TypeError: list indices must be integers, not str</code></p>  <p>I'm not really sure how to proceed given that the key is clearly a string and not an integer...</p>
