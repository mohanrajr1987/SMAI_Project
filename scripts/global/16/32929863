<p>I have have difficult in figuring out how I can turn my specific dataframe from my excel spreadsheet df[50] into a data frame with some specifications. (I do not want the first value into the array). For example df[50] consists of:</p>  <p>print(df[50])</p>  <pre><code>    0  50     1  29.52     2  29.97     3  29.52     4  29.97     5  31.5     6  33.93     7  36.54     8  34.02     9  33.48     10 32.04     11 33.03     12 35.01 </code></pre>  <p>What I would like is: </p>  <pre><code>[29.52, 29.97, 29.52, 29.97, 31.5, 33.93, 36.54, 34.02, 33.48, 32.04, 33.03, 35.01] </code></pre>  <p>how would i go about skipping the first value?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
