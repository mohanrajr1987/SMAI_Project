<p>I am given a bunch of strings that tell me about an event, and I need to convert all the strings into a start Datetime and an end Datetime. At first, I tried going character by character through the string, but it became too complicated when strings had multiple dates in them. I've also tried to parse many date formats, but when the days and months come first, then the times, it doesn't work. I am working with C#, and have also tried searching through strings using Regex but I'm having trouble with that because I can't match the day to the right time.</p>  <p>Here's a few examples of the strings I'm given:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>September 12-13,2015, Saturday 10:30 a.m.-6p.m. Sunday 10 a.m. noon</p> </blockquote>  <p>Should have 2 dates:</p>  <pre><code>StartDate: 9/12/15 10:30 AM EndDate: 9/12/15 6:00 PM StartDate: 9/13/15 10:00 AM EndDate: 9/13/15 12:00PM </code></pre>  <blockquote>   <p>June 3 - September 9, 2015, Tuesday-Thursday 6-7 p.m. , Sunday 10-11 a.m</p> </blockquote>  <p>Multiple dates Tuesday/Thursday/Sunday with date range:</p>  <pre><code>StartDate: 6/4/15 6:00 PM EndDate: 6/4/15 7:00 PM  StartDate: 6/7/15 10:00 AM EndDate: 6/7/15 11:00 AM  StartDate: 6/9/15 6:00 PM EndDate: 6/9/15 7:00 PM  StartDate: 6/11/15 6:00 PM EndDate: 6/11/15 7:00 PM </code></pre>  <p>â€¦..continues following same pattern</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
