<p>Our company has employed Yext to fix business listings across the web. We've discovered that a significant portion of the links on our business listings have bizarre code added to them that we did not sanction.</p>  <p>For example, our URL is:<br>  www.thewildiris.net </p>  <p>but Yext has added a few things to that, such as:<br> www.thewildiris.net/?Yext=55-2513AA </p>  <p>and the others have much more, such as:<br>   www.yelp.com/biz_redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thewildiris.net&amp;src_bizid=laA1e75HeN3Des5pUwFUXw&amp;cachebuster=1443921914&amp;s=52f12736b2cde3ee696da00dfc187e8b6bcd01c820f65b54161258b103e60eab </p>  <p>Or another one has:<br>  clicks.superpages.com/ct/clickThrough?SRC=yexttest&amp;target=SP&amp;PN=1&amp;FP=profile&amp;PGID=yp603.8084.1443921927239.134258140495&amp;ALG=113&amp;TS=nbt&amp;OF=1&amp;ACTION=log,red&amp;LID=0138039547&amp;TR=50&amp;bidType=FLCLIK&amp;PGSN=E0&amp;FL=profile&amp;TL=off&amp;LOC=<a href="http://www.thewildiris.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.thewildiris.net</a></p>  <p>And another has:<br>  ncpnxm.yext-wrap.com/plclick?pid=dca1c15771&amp;ids=2033499&amp;continue=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thewildiris.net%2F%3FYext%3D55-2513AA&amp;target=specialOffer</p>  <p>(And no, we do not have a "special offer" on that website that we know of)</p>  <p>(1) what does this extra code specifically do?</p>  <p>(2) Why is it different for each site, since Yext is in full control, and these sites will not let us edit our own business info?</p>  <p>(3) and will it allow Yext to remove our URLs from corrected listings if we unsubscribe from their service in the future?</p>  <p>(4) Can or does this affect our own webpage analytics, Google Analytics, or other tools we need as a business to track our traffic and customer interactions?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
