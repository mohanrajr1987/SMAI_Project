<p>I am trying to access the <code>IDbConnection</code> interface in a class library in order to make a connection object that connects and fetches data from the database, but I just cannot access the <code>IDbConnection</code> interface which was supposed to by in <strong>System.Data.dll</strong>.</p>  <p>I can't find it anywhere in NuGet either. So, how do I go about it?</p>  <p>Has Microsoft changed the way we make connections to a database as well, or is there any new interface introduced in .NET Core?</p>
