<p>I currently implementing a desktop application for my ASP.NET website. I am trying to use <code>WebBrowser</code> class to allow user to login to the site and then use <code>WebClient</code> to make api calls afterward. Based on research and experiment,  <code>WebBrowser</code> class and IE share the same cookie (which is good). But I am having a hard time copying the authenticated cookie into <code>CookieContainer</code> for my <code>WebClient</code>. </p>  <p>I tried to use <code>Application.GetCookie</code> which calls <code>InternetGetCookie</code> Win32API to get the cookie from IE, the problem is that it does not return the authentication cookie. It only returns cookies set by my site such as Language and User preferences. The cookie should be persistent cookie since I am still logged in after I close and reopen the browser. Any thoughts?</p>
