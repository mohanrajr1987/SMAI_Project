<p>Following situation: I got a little helper which shows the user what settings are wrong. In this particular case it's a textbox which specifies the output path. An adorner highlights the textbox by drawing rectangles of half-opaque rectangles around it. Now I'd like to disable hit tests for the are which is "grayed out", so that the user can only use the control that is highlighted. Another adorner shows a cancel button in the right lower corner of the application which allows to cancel this highlighting mode.</p>  <p>Is it possible to deactivate hit tests for all other controls or might it be possible to specify a <code>Geometry</code> which filters hit tests? I've seen you can do hit tests based on a <code>Geometry</code> but that seems to be a manual hit test to find a certain control but not to filter actual hit tests.</p>  <p>Disabling and re-enabling would be a lot of overhead since you would have to iterate through the whole <code>VisualTree</code>...</p>  <p>What's the easiest method? I'd really like it if it was possible using a Geometry or similiar.</p>
