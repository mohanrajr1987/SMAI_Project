<p>I'm unable to find the UnityExtensions for Unity for Prism 6. I'm trying to implement a composite application using Prism and Unity. The Prism 5 documentation uses this code to resolve its Shell (taken from the Commanding example):</p>  <pre><code>public class CommandingBootstrapper : UnityBootstrapper {     protected override DependencyObject CreateShell()     {         return Container.Resolve&lt;Shell&gt;();     }      ... } </code></pre>  <p>I think the Resolve method is in the Prism.UnityExtensions dll for Prism 5. But the extensions are now marked as deprecated and I cannot find the extensions for Prism 6, only the Unity for Prism 6 dll on NuGet.</p>  <p>Is there a replacement for UnityExtensions for Prism 6 or is the Shell resolved differently under Prism 6 when Unity is used?</p>
