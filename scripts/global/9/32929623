<p>I noticed most of the developers are using event for callback and I'm not sure whether I'm doing in a right way.</p>  <p>I noticed most of developers' codes look like this:</p>  <pre><code>public delegate void SampleDelegate(); public static event SampleDelegate SampleEvent; </code></pre>  <p>While the way I do "event" look like this:</p>  <pre><code>public delegate void SampleDelegate(); public SampleDelegate SampleEvent; // notice that I didn't set to static and not an event type </code></pre>  <p>I hope someone could explain to me what's the differences between both codes? Which way of doing delegate is a better practice? Is it better to set it as a static?</p>
