<p>I have an access token for a page on Facebook. I can view that page’s feed, and individual posts in that feed. But for some reason, I can only request the <code>/sharedposts</code> endpoint for <em>some</em> of them using v2.2 of the Graph API.</p>  <p>The access token has the <code>user_posts</code> and <code>read_stream</code> insights. When I request the <code>shares</code> field I can see more than one post with shares, but when I request <strong>[POST_ID]/sharedposts</strong> for some of them, I just get an empty <code>data</code> array in response.</p>  <p>Why is this? Are there some gotchas I should be aware of? It’s a tad frustrating that the <code>/sharedposts</code> edge will return returns for some posts but not others using the same access token and API version.</p>
