<p>I'm trying to customize the facebook preview information but can't get it to work. Although the link is being posted to facebook. And the meta tags are showing up when I inspect the console, but the preview is not being rendered.  </p>  <p>I allow users to post a link to my registration page with a referral code.  This is done in the user account page.<br> I put this in my head tag. $url is a variable i pass into user account page.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;head&gt;   &lt;?php if (isset($url) &amp;&amp; $url){ ?&gt;   @include('includes.facebook-meta')   &lt;?php } ?&gt; &lt;/head&gt; </code></pre>  <p>and my facebook-meta.blade.php looks like this :</p>  <pre><code>&lt;meta property="og:url" content=   'http://local.website.com/register'&gt; &lt;meta property="og:type" content="website" /&gt; &lt;meta property="og:title" content="MY TITLE"/&gt; &lt;meta property="og:description" content="My description" /&gt; &lt;meta property="og:image" content="/images/image.jpg&gt; &lt;meta property="fb:app_id" content=[app_id] /&gt; </code></pre>  <p>When I click on facebook share button, I get this message in the console </p>  <pre><code>Given URL is not allowed by the Application configuration:  One or more of the given URLs is not allowed by the App's settings. It must match the Website URL or Canvas URL,  or the domain must be a subdomain of one of the App's domains. </code></pre>  <p>My app settings on facebook already includes the domain name. I didn't think this would work but I tried adding  <a href="http://local.website.com/register" rel="nofollow">http://local.website.com/register</a> And obviously it didn't work lol.  So I don't know. I need help. Thanks!</p>  <p>** UPDATE **  Right now I'm using www.addthis.com for the share buttons. But before that I had this js file and it was the same thing.  I was able to share the url but not change the preview information.</p>  <pre><code>$(function(){      var referralUrl = url      $('#fb-share').on('click',function(){         FB.ui({             method: 'share',             href: referralUrl,             display:'popup',         },function(response){});     }); }); </code></pre>
