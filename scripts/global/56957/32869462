<p>I have been reading a lot about Facebook Page Real-time updates (RTUs), but the more I read the more confused I get, there are so many contradictory articles on this, and the Facebook documentation, is really high level.</p>  <p>So can someone verify my understanding? Can I subscribe to any Facebook public page for RTUs? How does it all link together. Apps, pages and subscriptions?</p>  <p>Any help is much appreciated.</p>
