<p>I would like to request the images fields from multiple target id´s (included in feed attachments).</p>  <p>For example the single request would be like <code>id?fields=images</code>, but I would like to request for multiple id´s. Is there a way to do so? If yes, what is the correct syntax? I've tried <code>id,id?fields=images</code>, but that did not work.</p>  <p>I am using Graph api V2.4 with a GET command.</p>
