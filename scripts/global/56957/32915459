<p>I know how to set the OG tags for pages to specify an image, but here is my situation:</p>  <p>I have a page with 4 shareable objects.  One leads to a page with it's own open graph tags, so he's okay.  The other three would share a link to an anchor position on the same page.  How could I make each of those get their own image?</p>  <p>So for instance:</p>  <p>Shareable 1: <a href="http://www.demo.com/page" rel="nofollow">http://www.demo.com/page</a>   &lt;---  FB get's the OG tags from that page Shareable 2: <a href="http://www.demo.com/home#video" rel="nofollow">http://www.demo.com/home#video</a> &lt;-- FB get's OG tag from home, I want to specify a different image Shareable 3: <a href="http://www.demo.com/home#photos" rel="nofollow">http://www.demo.com/home#photos</a> &lt;-- FB get's OG tag from home, I want to specify a different image Shareable 4: <a href="http://www.demo.com/home#cheese" rel="nofollow">http://www.demo.com/home#cheese</a> &lt;-- FB get's OG tag from home, I want to specify a different image</p>
