<p>I have a desktop application that generates an image. I want to share this image to Facebook. I <em>don't</em> want to implement the whole workflow, the login dialog etc. (and even if I did, the Facebook Web Sharing documentation doesn't seem to cover regular desktop apps so I wouldn't know how to).</p>  <p>I've already uploaded the image to cloud hosting and have a direct link. Let's assume there is a default browser properly configured in the operating system, and the user is logged into FB in that browser. Is it possible to trigger sharing the image by simply requesting a specific Facebook URL via this browser?</p>  <p>If not, what options do I have?</p>
