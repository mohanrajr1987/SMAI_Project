<p>I have created a Facebook app and would like to download a specific page's statistics using a Windows application. So I have my <code>App Id</code>, and <code>app secret</code> secret. I have read in the <em>Graph API docs</em> that you need an access token and this access token needs a local host for the handshake. </p>  <p>My question is, isn't there a way that once the permission is granted from the page owner, my app be able to get the information without the need of this authorization? </p>  <p>In Google Analytics, there is an option to use "service accounts" instead of <em>Oauth2.0</em> so that the handshake will be omitted.</p>
