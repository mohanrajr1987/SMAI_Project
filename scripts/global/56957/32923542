<p>Hi I want to know about how I can see the full page results while loading AJAX on Facebook for example I searched <a href="https://www.facebook.com/search/160300197351040/likers" rel="nofollow">https://www.facebook.com/search/160300197351040/likers</a> People who like Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan but my browser doesn't allow me to collect all the urls of profiles or user ids.. is there any way to get full page results. or If I use Facebook Api does it work and I can print all the URLs or user names or ids</p>
