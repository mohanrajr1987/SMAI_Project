<p>As you know facebook has moved to api 2.4, and now I can't get the user's gender with my previous code.</p>  <pre><code>    $f1 = new Fb_ypbox();     $user_data = $f1-&gt;getUserData();     $fb_user_id        = $user_data['id'];             $name = $user_data['name]; $gender = $user_data['gender']; $birthday = $user_data['birthday']; </code></pre>  <p>Now this code only gets the user id &amp; the usre name &amp; his profile picture. Not the gender or his birth date (although I have the extended permission of user_birthday).</p>  <p>Is there any chance to update my code or any other code to get the user's public info (gender for example) which doesn't request any extended permissions?  </p>  <p>I just know that now it's not just making the GET request for "/me", but I also should add the "?fields=gender" addition.. I just can't manage to add it to my current sdk code. </p>  <p>I have read Facebook's API documentation couple of times and I can't figure it out..</p>  <p>Thanks :)</p>
