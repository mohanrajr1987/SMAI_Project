<p>I cannot figure out how to filter all ads I retrieve using the Facebook Marketing API inside the url. I get alls events of an ad account by</p>  <pre><code>https://graph.facebook.com/v2.4/act_XYZ/adgroups?fields=name,tracking_specs </code></pre>  <p>But how do I specify the action.type to only show events with the type "rsvp"?</p>  <p>I tried different methods like</p>  <pre><code>https://graph.facebook.com/v2.4/act_XYZ/adgroups?fields=name,tracking_specs&amp;tracking_specs={action.type:"rsvpw"} </code></pre>  <p>and many other ways but I do always get the same results as using the call without any filter.</p>  <p>I also tried giving the same parameters in side the HTTP Head but did not work either. What do I need to do in order to get my results filtered by the action type and furthermore the second step would be to also specify the exact event.</p>  <p>I am using Meteor as backend but that should not be a problem since everything I am doing is working.</p>  <p>Just to provide more information how I do the HTTP call.</p>  <pre><code>HTTP.call("GET", "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.4/act_XYZ/adgroups?fields=name,tracking_specs",{               params: {                   access_token: Meteor.users.findOne({_id:adaccounts[s].userId}).services.facebook.accessToken               }             }); </code></pre>  <p>This works perfectly with any other API endpoint I am using but I just do not know how to apply the filter. I already use since and until for receiving events.</p>
