<p>I'm in progress to create a new website that about videos.. People there accept my FB app then they will be able to share videos in their timelines.</p>  <p>It's not a share, the process of that share will work with Video Upload by Graph API.</p>  <p>There's a plenty of parameters when uploading videos with Graph API. One of those is "message", that is point to the description that will be shown above the video.</p>  <p>My question is: If I include the URL of the original video(URL of the video on my website) in the bottom of that video's description, may this will ban my Facebook application?</p>  <p>I had something like that with "Image Upload with Graph API".. But nowadays I see some guys who do what I'm asking about without any issues!</p>  <p>Any suggestions from Facebook developers?</p>
