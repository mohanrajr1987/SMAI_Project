<p>Can you please explain me how to get info about posts like this : <a href="https://www.facebook.com/828027970565841/posts/900654699969834?_rdr=p" rel="nofollow">https://www.facebook.com/828027970565841/posts/900654699969834?_rdr=p</a> <br>Or like this  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/882291048492401/posts/881757285212444?_rdr=p" rel="nofollow">https://www.facebook.com/882291048492401/posts/881757285212444?_rdr=p</a></p>  <p>Without read_stream i can get other posts with same scheme by graph.api.com/2.2/{post_id}, but not those. <br> With read_stream i can get all of the posts. <br> I have noticed that i can't  get information about those posts without read_stream permission. So i don't understand how read_stream can affect this case, also read_steam is restricted for web apps.  My question is : how i can access  those posts <b>without read_stream</b> that disabled for web apps,  or what changes needs to be done in security settings of post creators to make it visible for me at graph api.<br>  Thank you!</p>
