<p>I need to post messages on a Facebook page. Specifically I want to post via <code>cron</code>.</p>  <p>Here's what the API docs say:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Page Access Token â€“ These access tokens are similar to user access tokens, except that they provide permission to APIs that read, write or modify the data belonging to a Facebook Page. To obtain a page access token you need to start by obtaining a user access token and asking for the manage_pages permission. Once you have the user access token you then get the page access token via the Graph API.</p> </blockquote>  <p>How I can obtain a user access and page access token without a page callback? Is this possible?</p>
