<p>So after I enter in my Facebook login info occasionally I get a weird white window instead of the normal white perm window on my android device.  Here is a screen shot of what it looks like.  Not sure what is going on, since the Facebook plugin I'm assuming has control of the activity at that time. <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/CFMjP.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/CFMjP.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
