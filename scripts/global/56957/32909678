<p>My website (<a href="http://www.guidoleurs.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.guidoleurs.org</a>) is finished, however if I want to share and promote it on social media I come across a problem. Somehow if I want to share my static frontpage on Facebook (by copy/pasting the link in a post) I only see “guidoleurs.org” without any information or image. Also beneath every blog post I have the Accesspress Social Share buttons, but if I want to use them to share a post, the Facebook post looks like “404 not found” (although the link works) without the featured image..</p>  <p>How can I fix this?</p>  <p>I also used the debug tool of Facebook and when I paste either link from my website in, I get the following result: <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/og/object?q=http%3A%2F%2Fguidoleurs.org%2F2015%2F08%2F27%2Fblog-1%2F" rel="nofollow">https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/og/object?q=http%3A%2F%2Fguidoleurs.org%2F2015%2F08%2F27%2Fblog-1%2F</a></p>
