<p>I developed while back a facebook graph api app that used the conversations edge to read messages and then reply back, this was done using the v2.3 version of the API.</p>  <p>Back then the API at</p>  <p><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/v2.3/conversation/messages#publish" rel="nofollow">https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/v2.3/conversation/messages#publish</a></p>  <p>stated that:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Note that a page can only reply to a user's message. It cannot   initiate a private message with a user. Also, a page can respond not   more than twice to a user's message before the user has replied back</p> </blockquote>  <p>But now i have to upgrade to v2.4 and i can't seem to find anywhere the above statement.</p>  <p>Does anyone now if this limit has been lifted?</p>
