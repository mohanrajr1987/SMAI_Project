<p>With Facebook login I store the user's facebook supplied USERID for the app locally. When a user goes to his profile, I would love to show a comment count of how many comments the user has posted to the App/Site. I know you can get total comments to a URL like so:</p>  <p><a href="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.4/?fields=share" rel="nofollow">https://graph.facebook.com/v2.4/?fields=share</a>{comment_count}&amp;id=</p>  <p>Is there an easy way to get total comments from a particular user ID for an entire site/app; since user IDs are unique to the app they are created for.</p>  <p>All feedback appreciated.</p>  <p>Cheers Ryan</p>
