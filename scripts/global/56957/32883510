<p>So here is the challenge that I have.</p>  <p>I have a bunch of back-end controllers which get the request and generate some responses. I know the front-end people can use those responses and generate the required social meta tags dynamically. For example they can produce the following snippet in their template's :</p>  <pre><code>    &lt;meta property="og:url" content="" &gt;     &lt;meta property="og:description" content="" &gt;     &lt;meta property="og:image" content="" &gt; </code></pre>  <p>But my question is, is there anyway that I can send the social tags via URL.  In other words I don't want to have a template with some placeholders for social tags. I just want to generate them on the fly when a specific URL was requested and passing them via the URL.</p>  <p>Something like: <a href="http://example.com/api/action?og:image=someimage.png" rel="nofollow">http://example.com/api/action?og:image=someimage.png</a></p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
