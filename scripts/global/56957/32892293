  <p>I'm using the Graph API to grab values from Facebook Insights, but I don't have a Facebook page to test it on. The one I created has only one like, and when I went to check the page likes the values remain 0.</p>  <pre><code>array (size=2)   'value' =&gt; int 0   'end_time' =&gt; string '2015-09-01T07:00:00+0000' (length=24) </code></pre>  <p>I was reading through the documentation and says, </p>  <blockquote>   <p>"Page Insights are available after at least 30 people like your Page.   Please keep in mind that it can sometimes take several hours for   insights to become available after 30 people have liked your Page."</p> </blockquote>  <p>I can't really get down into testing my code (and graphs created from these values) properly without any real numbers... is there a way to test this?</p>
