<p>I have a problem with Facebook Graph API/SDK .NET.<br> In my Website a user can log in with his Facebook-Account. I only want to have organizers of public Events to log on to this page. <br> But when a user logs in, I only get information about his own events, and that's the result I don't want. I want to get the evens of the Facebook-Page of a user (pages like clubs, associations, ...)<br> How can I get (if exists) a Facebook-Page where the logged in user is admin of, so that i can get events of this page?<br> Must a Facebook-Page have a 'real' user behind it or is it usual that the page is administrated without an admin user? Is there any way to get the information i want?</p>  <pre><code>public ActionResult FBLogin() {     var fb = new FacebookClient();     var loginUrl = fb.GetLoginUrl(new     {         client_id = "client_id",         client_secret = "client_secret",         redirect_uri = RedirectUri.AbsoluteUri,         response_type = "code",         scope = "user_events"     });      return Redirect(loginUrl.AbsoluteUri); }  public ActionResult FBCallback(string code) {     var facebook = new FacebookClient();     dynamic r = facebook.Post("oauth/access_token", new     {         client_id = "client_id",         client_secret = "client_secret",         redirect_uri = RedirectUri.AbsoluteUri,         code = code     });      var accessToken = r.access_token;     Session["AccessToken"] = accessToken;     facebook.AccessToken = accessToken;     dynamic me = facebook.Get("me/events");     return null; } </code></pre>  <p>Thanks a lot!</p>
