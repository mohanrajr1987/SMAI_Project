<p><br /></p>  <p>I just started with Facebook SDK for android.<br /> I built a simple log in app, but something is very bad.<br /> In my app, I log in using <strong><em>LoginManager</em></strong> and if the log in was successfuly done - I get an <strong><em>Access Token</em></strong>. Simple and great. This action also accept the permissions of my app for the the user that just logged in using my app.<br /><br /> But, if I uninstall the app (my app) from my phone (without log out), and then install it again<br />and try to log in again, I get an <strong><em>"Invalid key hash. The key hash {blablablabla} does not match any stored key hashes. ..."</em></strong> error shown in some facebook activity.<br /><br /></p>  <p>So, the user accept the app permissions in the past, and get some Access Token. But when he try to log in again after a fresh app installing, it does not work and show error.<br /> I think it's because the user accepted the permissions in the past with some Access Token, and now, when the Access Token is NULL (because of a fresh installing), the facebook sdk does not accept that.</p>  <p>I just need my app to recognize that the user already has permissions,<br /> and do not log in. So I tried to check if the user has permissions:<br /></p>  <pre><code>         new GraphRequest(                 **{{{Access Token is missing}}}**,                 "/me/permissions",                 null,                 HttpMethod.GET,                 new GraphRequest.Callback()                  {                     public void onCompleted(GraphResponse response)                      {                         if( response.getError() != null )                         {                             //user has no permissions, do login                         }                         else                         {                             //user has permissions, do not login                         }                     }                 }             ).executeAsync(); </code></pre>  <p>but because it's a fresh installing app (so the user has no Access Token), the Access Token is missing. So, I tried to create a new Access Token (somehow):<br /></p>  <pre><code>        AccessToken.createFromNativeLinkingIntent(getIntent(), getString(R.string.facebook_app_id), new AccessTokenCreationCallback()      {         public void onSuccess(AccessToken token)          {             AccessToken.setCurrentToken(token);         }          public void onError(FacebookException error)          {         }     }); </code></pre>  <p>but it's does not work. onError(FacebookException error) is always invoked.<br /> How to solve that?</p>  <p><strong>EDIT : if I succeed to check if the user has permissions, so then I can easily remove the current permissions and then make a new log in,<br /> and that's will solve my problem.</strong></p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
