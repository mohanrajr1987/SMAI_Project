<p>I'm trying to create a Javascript application that has a filterable listing of certain kinds of public Facebook events. The thing is, the FB Graph API requires that you provide a User Access token in order to use the search for public events. I really don't want to make people log in to facebook in order to use the website, especially because ANY facebook user's credentials are sufficient to query the events I want to query (ie the search is independent of any user credentials, I just need them because the fb api requires me to have a user access token.)</p>  <p>Do y'all have any suggestions for a work around? I'm thinking about providing my own credentials securely, and just using them to make the actual queries. The thing is I would potentially need to be doing A LOT of queries per minute, so this might not be terribly realistic. Any suggestions would be helpful.</p>
