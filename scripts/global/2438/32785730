<p>I have a situation in Laravel 5.1 where I would like to add a many-to-many relationship to an existing relationship. According to the diagram below, I already have all the items in green working.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/MxAq9.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/MxAq9.jpg" alt="Diagram"></a></p>  <p>The issue is that since there isn't a primary key on the <code>issue_person</code> table, I don't know how to add a many-to-many relationship to Users. Does anyone know how I would go about accomplishing this?</p>
