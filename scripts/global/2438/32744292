<p>I have a table of transactions. For any given record, I want to be able to include a portal which shows all related transactions. Since the related records are in the same table as the parent record, I have created a second table occurrence (TO). I have linked these two TOs with a join table, into which I enter the foreign keys of the two TOs to indicate which records relate to which other records.</p>  <p>On the layout for a given transaction, I've added a portal which displays related records from the second table occurrence. So far, so good.</p>  <p>So, let's say in the join table I said transaction 100 is linked to transactions 105 and 110. In the portal for transaction 100, I can see records 105 &amp; 110.</p>  <p>However, I would also like to see transaction 100 in the portal for transaction 105, but can't figure out how to do this, without having to manually enter the same relationship, but in reverse.</p>  <p>NB. I'm using Filemaker Pro 12.</p>
