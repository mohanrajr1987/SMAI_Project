<p>I have got a Stop model and a Service model. They form a ManyToMany relationship with each other. This is done by using <code>stops = models.ManyToManyField(Stop, related_name='services')</code> inside the Service model.</p>  <p>I would like to create new services and stops while making as few queries as possible. Currently, this is how I do it:</p>  <ol> <li>Create all new services using <code>bulk_create</code></li> <li>Create all new stops using <code>bulk_create</code></li> <li>Retrieve all services from the database</li> <li>Retrieve all stops from the database</li> <li>Add the appropriate stops to each service</li> </ol>  <p>In this way, step 5 will produce as many queries as the number of services. </p>  <p>Is there a simpler way of saving ManyToMany relationships? Also, could I spare retrieving all services and stops right after creating them?</p>  <p>Service:</p>  <pre><code>class Service(models.Model):      # Many to many relationship with Stop     stops = models.ManyToManyField(Stop, related_name='services')     name = models.CharField(max_length=5, blank=False, unique=True)     type = models.CharField(max_length=40, blank=False)     description = models.CharField(max_length=100, blank=False) </code></pre>  <p>Stop:</p>  <pre><code>class Stop(models.Model):      name = models.CharField(max_length=100, blank=False, unique=True)     latitude = models.FloatField()     longitude = models.FloatField() </code></pre>
