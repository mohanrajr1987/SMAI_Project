<p>I'm trying to create an many to many entity in asp.net C#. I have looked at the student/course example before and it is logical but something is literally wrong when I try use it in my own code.</p>  <p>Here is the code where I'm stuck.</p>  <pre><code>    [HttpPost]     public ActionResult BuyWeapon(int weaponId)     {         string currentUserId = User.Identity.GetUserId();          var ctx = new DAL.ProjectStrawberryEntities();          Character character = ctx.Characters.FirstOrDefault(c =&gt; c.AccountId == currentUserId);         Weapon weapon = ctx.Weapons.FirstOrDefault(w =&gt; w.Id == weaponId);          if (character.Gold - weapon.Price &gt;= 0)         {             // Add weapon to character              character.Gold -= (int)weapon.Price;         }          return View();     } </code></pre>  <p>The only properties <code>Character</code> and <code>Weapon</code> has is <code>WeaponCharacter</code>, which is my bridge table for <code>Weapon</code> and <code>Character</code>.</p>  <p>Here are my <code>Character</code> and <code>Weapon</code> models from my database.</p>  <pre><code>public partial class Character {     public Character()     {         this.WeaponCharacters = new HashSet&lt;WeaponCharacter&gt;();     }      *Removed wall of propeties*      public virtual AspNetUser AspNetUser { get; set; }     public virtual Class Class { get; set; }     public virtual Gender Gender { get; set; }     public virtual ICollection&lt;WeaponCharacter&gt; WeaponCharacters { get; set; } }  public partial class Weapon {     public Weapon()     {         this.WeaponCharacters = new HashSet&lt;WeaponCharacter&gt;();     }      *Removed wall of propeties*      public virtual WeaponType WeaponType { get; set; }     public virtual ICollection&lt;WeaponCharacter&gt; WeaponCharacters { get; set; } }  public partial class WeaponCharacter {     public int CharacterId { get; set; }     public int WeaponId { get; set; }     public int Quantity { get; set; }      public virtual Character Character { get; set; }     public virtual Weapon Weapon { get; set; } } </code></pre>  <p>I cropped out some properties since they are unnecessary.<br> <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/VQrs5.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/VQrs5.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Shouldn't <code>Character</code> have an <code>ICollection&lt;Weapon&gt;</code>? Am I wrong to use a many to many relation for this?</p>  <p>The goal I'm trying to reach is: I want a character to buy a weapon, it is possible to buy several of the same weapon but only once per click.</p>
