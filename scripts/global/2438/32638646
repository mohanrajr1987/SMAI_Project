<p>I am working with an API where only certain whitelisted domains are able to access our services. Each domain can use a multitude of services (we have more than one), and each domain will have a unique access token related to each service.</p>  <p>Here is the structure of the tables I have set up:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/uVglq.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/uVglq.png" alt="DB Table Relationships"></a></p>  <p>Basically, there is a M2M relationship between Whitelist_Domains and Services, as well as a M2M relationship between Services and Tokens.</p>  <p>I want to retrieve "TOKEN" from the Tokens table, and the information I provided with is Whitelist_Domains.DOMAIN, and Services.ID.</p>  <p>I am having trouble generating a SQL query that will return the correct information though.</p>  <p>Any help would greatly be appreciated. Thanks.</p>
