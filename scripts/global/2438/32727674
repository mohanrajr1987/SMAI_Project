<p>I have the following relationship defined:</p>  <pre><code>{   "name": "playlist",   "base": "PersistedModel",   "relations": {     "songs": {       "type": "hasAndBelongsToMany",       "model": "song",       "foreignKey": ""     }    }   }   </code></pre>  <p>So a <code>Song hasAndBelongsToMany Playlist</code>. So far so good.</p>  <p>But when it comes to adding songs to a playlist, I am confused.</p>  <p>Ideally I'd like, for example, to be able to add the new songs in the same call of the playlist <code>create</code> endpoint. I have no idea how to do that, and the docs are quite poor imho.</p>  <p>It seems I have to do a <code>POST</code> on <code>/playlists/:id/songs</code> in order to associate songs to playlists? But then, I don't want to create new songs, just add existing songs to a playlist. Would that work this way? Wouldn't a <code>POST</code> at the mentioned URL add (and wanting to create) new songs?</p>  <p>BTW, using <code>postgresql</code> as backend. What's the correct way to do that?</p>
