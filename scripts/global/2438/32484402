<p>On update, I'm trying to clear all associations from a model having <code>ManyToMany</code> association with another. However, the associations are still persisted.</p>  <p>To explain my point, consider the following 2 models:</p>  <pre><code>class Teacher(models.Model):     school = models.ForeignKey(School)     students = models.ManyToManyField(Student)  class Student(models.Model):     school = models.ForeignKey(School) </code></pre>  <p>Now, I wish to remove all associations of teacher to student, or vice-versa, whenever the shool changes for either model. So I decided to override the <code>save()</code> method for <code>Teacher</code> first.</p>  <pre><code>class Teacher(models.Model):      ...      ...      def save(self, *args, **kwargs):           # after figuring out "school_id" changed           self.students.remove()            super(Teacher, self).save(*args, **kwargs) </code></pre>  <p>However, once the <code>Teacher</code> object is persisted, I can see that all the <code>Student</code> associations are <em>reinserted</em> into the association table.</p>  <p>Am I missing out something here, or, is there some way to instruct the <code>models.Model.save()</code> not to reinsert the associations?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
