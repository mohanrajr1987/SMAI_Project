<p>I have 3 tables in my music collection database </p>  <h2>Album</h2>  <p>Album_id,Title,Date_id,album rating,compilation ,no_of_tracks,album,condition,format (cd/vinyl)</p>  <h2>Tracks</h2>  <p>track_id,Track name,duration,Album_id</p>  <h2>Artist</h2>  <p>Artist_id,Name,Track_id(not sure about this attribute)</p>  <p>I would like to consider another entity called "Band". Album can be of band or 2-3 artist. So, how can I form relationship between artist, band, album so that it is normalized?</p>
