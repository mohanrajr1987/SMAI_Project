<p>I've create a transition table with Entity Framework code first migration by putting an ICollection Users in an Objectives Entity and a ICollection Objectives in the Users Entity.  It successfully creates the many to many transition table called ObjectiveUsers table with only the id's from the respective tables.  Now when I go to my view model, I can't figure out how to tell Vue.js to use the ObjectivesUsers table when rendering its v-model with a Users view model with the Objectives collection property.  I'm looking for any help on how to succeed with this pattern. </p>
