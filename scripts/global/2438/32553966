<p>Is it Possible to create a weighted measure of a many to many relationship in an SSAS tabular model?</p>  <p>For instance, lets say I have stores and sales reps that service the stores.  Some stores will have multiple sales reps and each sales rep will receive a percentage of the overall sales in that store.  The percentage is calculated off the sale amount of the transaction.</p>  <p>So store A has Rep A making 5% of sales and store A has Rep B making 3% of sales.</p>  <p>Rep A and Rep B also service many other stores and get commissions off those stores as well.</p>  <p>So I've got a stores table that holds my stores as well as a Sales table that holds my various measures, with one of the measures being CommissionsPaid for each transaction.  </p>  <p>Then I've got a Sales_Reps table that's my junction table between Sales and Reps and finally a Reps table.</p>  <p>In my commissions table I have a measure that says:</p>  <pre><code>RepCommissions:=CALCULATE(SUM([CommissionsPaid]), Sales_Reps) </code></pre>  <p>Assuming the stores Sales were $100, when I slice and dice this, I am currently getting:</p>  <pre><code>Store A Sales            Rep A Commissions        Rep B Commissions  100                      8                         8 </code></pre>  <p>when what I really want is </p>  <pre><code>Store A Sales            Rep A Commissions        Rep B Commissions  100                      5                         3 </code></pre>  <p>In my Sales_Reps table I have a weight column where I calculate each reps percentage of the overall commissions for each transaction but I cant seem to figure out how to make it work so that my measure applies the weight when needed.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
