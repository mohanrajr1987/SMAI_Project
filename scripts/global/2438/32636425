<p>Good day.  I would like to know why a Parameter Request pops up when executing a query.  I have a form with 2 comboboxes where the 2nd one depends on the value in the 1st one.  I do know how to do this when it involves 2 tables.  I am having trouble when there is a many to many relationship.</p>  <p>Table 1: name - Supply_Sources, fields - Source_ID(pk), SupplySourceName</p>  <p>Table 2: name - Warehouse_Locations, fields - WLocation_ID(pk), Location_Name</p>  <p>Table 3 (junction): name - SupplySource_WarehouseLocation, fields - Supply_Source_ID(pk), Location_In_ID(pk)</p>  <p>On my form frmInventoryReceivedInput I have cboSupplySource and cboWLocation. I populate cboSupplySource with</p>  <pre><code>     SELECT [Supply_Sources].[Source_ID], [Supply_Sources].[SupplySourceName] FROM Supply_Sources;  </code></pre>  <p>I am trying to get a drop down list in the cboWLocation based on the value in cboSupplySource.  I am wanting to see the location names of where the supplies are placed in the warehouse.  </p>  <p>I have a requery in cboSupplySource After Update (with cboWLocation as the control name). The SQL that I have come up with so far is:</p>  <pre><code>    SELECT Warehouse_Locations.Location_Name,     SupplySource_WarehouseLocation.Supply_Source_ID,      SupplySource_WarehouseLocation.Location_In_ID     FROM Warehouse_Locations RIGHT JOIN (Supply_Sources LEFT JOIN     SupplySource_WarehouseLocation ON Supply_Sources.Source_ID =     SupplySource_WarehouseLocation.Supply_Source_ID) ON     Warehouse_Locations.WLocation_ID =      SupplySource_WarehouseLocation.Location_In_ID     WHERE (((Warehouse_Locations.Location_Name)=[frmInventoryReceivedInput].[cboSupplySource]));  </code></pre>  <p>When it runs, on tabbing out of cboSupplySource, Enter Parameter Value dialogue box pops up, looking for frmInventoryReceivedInput.cboSupplySource input. Nothing I input brings up the correct list in cboWLocation.  </p>  <p>Obviously, I do not have the correct select statement. Any help would be appreciated.</p>
