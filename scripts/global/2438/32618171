<p>I've got a model that has a list of tags.  </p>  <pre><code>class Document(models.Model):     docfile = models.FileField(upload_to='documents/%Y/%m/%d', max_length=150)     tags = models.ManyToManyField(Tag) </code></pre>  <p>I want to be able to find all the Documents that are tagged with X and Y, but not exclusively X and Y. That is, I want documents that are tagged with X, Y, Z to show up when I search for X and Y.</p>  <p>The accepted answer from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13270513/django-manytomany-filter-matching-on-all-items-in-a-list">this</a> question gets me pretty far, but it returns items that are tagged with those and only those tags.  The annotation limits the query set.  </p>
