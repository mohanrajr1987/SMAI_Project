<p>My application takes a screenshot and upon a button click, will save it and bring up the PrintHelper to see if you want to print.  Everything works fine except my PrintHelper.  The PrintHelper in my application cannot find my printer on the same network.  However, when the screenshot is saved, opening it as a pdf in Hancom PDF Viewer application and printing from it's PrintHelper (or PrintManager) will allow my printer to be noticed, so I can print the screenshot.</p>  <p>The code I am using for my Print Helper in the OnClick call is as follows:</p>  <pre><code>PrintHelper printHelp = new PrintHelper(this.getActivity());  printHelp.setScaleMode(PrintHelper.SCALE_MODE_FILL); printHelp.printBitmap(myFileName, myBitmapScreenshot); </code></pre>  <p>So my question is why would the PrintHelper or PrintManager in the Hancom PDF Viewer be able to scan my printer, but not my app's PrintHelper?</p>
