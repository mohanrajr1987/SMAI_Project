<p>When I load a fragment twice, it just gets loaded above the contents of the same fragment that was loaded earlier.</p>  <p>I have this code to load it - </p>  <pre><code>Fragment newFragment = new GridFragment();                 FragmentTransaction ft = getFragmentManager().beginTransaction();                 ft.add(R.id.gridFrame, newFragment).commit();  // gridFrame is the FrameLayout over which I replace it with the fragment </code></pre>  <p>How do I just refresh the fragment and not load again above the prior contents ?</p>
