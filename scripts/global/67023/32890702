<p>I'm having a weird issue that is causing a conflict. I had to switch to native <code>Fragments</code> to fix it, but there are bugs with that.</p>  <p>My original problem: I have a navigation drawer setup with <code>v4 Fragments.</code> To ask for permission in one of my Fragments I call <code>ActivityCompat.requestPermissions(getActivity(), Manifest.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION, 1);</code> The prompt shows up just fine, but when I accept or deny the permission, nothing happens. The callback <code>onRequestPermissionsResult()</code> is never called. Instead it gets called in the Activity that my Fragments are attached to. Useless to me, I need the callback to work in the Fragment.</p>  <p>With this in mind I was told that I need to use <code>FragmentCompat</code>, but that only works with <code>native Fragments (v13+)</code>, so I changed navigation drawer to work from native Fragments instead of the v4 support library Fragments. <em>However</em>, because I'm using AppCompatActivity, certain things do not work, like <code>addToBackStack()</code> and going back to a previous fragment.</p>  <p>Long story short, does anyone know how I can use the <code>v4.Fragment</code> and still call for permission in the <code>Fragment</code> and get the callback to be in the <code>Fragment</code>? I feel like this is a bug in Android that hasn't been addressed but I'm not 100%. </p>  <p>Sorry if this is a little longwinded. Let me know if you need to see my code, it's just the standard methods that you need for runtime permissions, I would like to work with v4 Fragments though which doesn't work from my understanding.</p>  <p>Thanks for any advice you have to offer!</p>
