<p>I have an activity for user registration. At some point, in that activity I have a fragment with registration form. When user click <strong>REGISTER</strong> button I have a an event dispatched with event bus like this</p>  <p>In <strong>RegistrationFragment</strong> (contained in <strong>RegistrationActivity</strong>)</p>  <pre><code>EventBus.getDefault().post(new RegistrationSuccessfulEvent()); </code></pre>  <p>In <strong>RegistrationActivity</strong> </p>  <pre><code>public void onEvent(RegistrationSuccessfulEvent event) {     startActivity(new Intent(this, MainActivity.class)); } </code></pre>  <p>I get this exception</p>  <pre><code>Could not dispatch event: class com.myapp.RegistrationSuccessfulEvent to subscribing class class com.myapp.RegistrationActivity ...  java.lang.IllegalStateException: Activity has been destroyed </code></pre>  <p>Why I get activity destroyed? Is it possible that if activity A contains a fragment F that activity is terminated while F is still up and running? I thought that A is alive while F is alive or any other contained fragment is in running state. I'm quite confused about activity-fragment coupling lifecycle.</p>
