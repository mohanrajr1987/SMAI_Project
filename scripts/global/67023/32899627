<p>I have two fragments inside my activity. Fragment A which registers new listeners in the "OnResume" event.</p>  <p>I then add Fragment B by</p>  <pre><code>fragmentTansaction.add(R.id.fragment_home, newFragment, tag); fragmentTansaction.addToBackStack(null); </code></pre>  <p>Now I want to unregister the listeners in Fragment A but none of the events: OnPause, OnStop, OnDestroy, OnDestroyView seem to be fired when Fragment B is added and Fragment A goes in the background.</p>  <p>Even setUserVisibleHint or onHiddenChanged is not fired.</p>  <p>Build Tools version is 23.0.1 and Compile SDK version is 23</p>  <p>Spent two days on this minuscule problem and exhausted my google-fu skills.</p>
