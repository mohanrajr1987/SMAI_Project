<p>In my app  I have two fragment in view pager in Fragment 1 I have a list view, in item list view have :tile, image and a button I want when I click button I can load JSON from sever and save it in a folder(file txt) of sd card and when  I click it again I can delete content in txt file And with stored data  I can show it in fragment tow. I did it by the following method without success:  when I click button I start new thread request to JSON and have data,then I save it But when I show two fragment I can't get it, when I restart my app I can get it The problem occurs here is the thread that runs parallel to the activity and when I restart the application to get the results of thread What measures have to take the results thread as soon as it has completed the download data? or Or any measures that might help me do it? Thank so much</p>
