<p>I'm designing a 2D Android game in Unity 5. I'd like the different menus to transition smoothly within the same scene, identical to many popular games like Puzzle and Dragons, Terra Battle, and Monster Strike. I know that applications such as Android Studio can use fragments to achieve this, so does Unity have something similar? If not, how would I go about handling this programming-wise?</p>
