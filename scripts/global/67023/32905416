<p>I have the following code which is the way to implement a spinner in the onCreateView of my fragment class:</p>  <pre><code>    Spinner obj = (Spinner) v.findViewById(R.id.obj1);      String[] seven = {"Dubhe"};     // Creating adapter for spinner     ArrayAdapter&lt;String&gt; dataAdapter = new ArrayAdapter&lt;String&gt;(this.getActivity()             ,android.R.layout.simple_spinner_dropdown_item, seven);     // attaching data adapter to spinner     obj.setAdapter(dataAdapter);      // Create a listener for user choice of spinner (object)     obj.setOnItemSelectedListener(new AdapterView.OnItemSelectedListener() {          @Override         public void onItemSelected(AdapterView&lt;?&gt; parentView, View selectedItemView,                                    int position, long id) {             //Message.message(getActivity(), "con");         }          @Override         public void onNothingSelected(AdapterView&lt;?&gt; parentView) {             // your code here         }      });      return v; </code></pre>  <p>In the onItemSelected method I wish to take the users choice from the spinner and call a method within the fragment class, that saves the current view data to a database. Of course, when the view of the fragment is first set up, it is done so at the return v; line and therefore calling such a method would be pointless as it will give an error.  However, if you find a way of setting it up so that the listener does not fire on start up, how would you then go about doing the above? Would something passing the user selection via an intent or something work?</p>  <p>I hope this makes sense. Any help would be great!</p>
