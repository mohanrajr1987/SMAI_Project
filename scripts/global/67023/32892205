<p>We use <code>YouTubePlayerSupportFragment</code> in our application and it fails to load some videos. We guess it's a bug of the implementation, because the bug is not reproducible with using <code>YoutubePlayerFragment</code>. Taking in account the fact that Youtube updated their library only once - there's no chance to wait for quick update. So we want to use <code>YoutubePlayerFragment</code> for now.</p>  <p>The question is whether it's possible to use Fragment with support Activity e.g. <code>FragmentActivity</code>? We need support activity because we use toolbar and some other features from AppCompat.</p>  <p>Thanks for any help.</p>
