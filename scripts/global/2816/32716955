<p>I am searching easy way to verify replicated documents, that all of them were transferred. Also, when some documents have error during replication process, how to check, which one and/or why ?</p>  <p>Now, I have an idea, that I could check current checkpointed sequence on the source. Then list all ids from source/_changes and then HEADing (or GETing) documents from target database and verify their presence (or values).</p>
