<p>I have CouchDB servers behind a load balancer. It is required to track the requests being made to the web server and the source of the request. When the INFO level logging is enabled all the requests are logged but the source IP is that of the load balancer. When the DEBUG mode logging is enabled, the actual source IP of the request is visible in the "Clienthost" field in the logs.</p>  <p>The DEBUG is too verbose and may fill up the disks pretty quickly.</p>  <p>Is there a way to get all the access logged along with the actual source IP (Clienthost) without enabling DEBUG.</p>
