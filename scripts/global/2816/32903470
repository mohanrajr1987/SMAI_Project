<p>I have a webpage thats connected to an apache server with CouchDB. The Machine run OSX</p>  <p>The problem i have is that i want to connect to the database without specifying the port. The standard port of CouchDB is 5984. The name of the DB is "charter". So when i type localhost:5984/charter i am able to reach the db. But i want to only specify localhost/charter.</p>  <p>I expect i have to perform som configurations in Apache.</p>  <p>I have tested to add the following in httpd.conf:</p>  <pre><code>ProxyRequests Off     &lt;Proxy *&gt;         Order deny,allow         Allow from all     &lt;/Proxy&gt;     ProxyPass /charter http://localhost:5984/     ProxyPassReverse /charter http://localhost:5984/ &lt;/VirtualHost&gt; </code></pre>  <p>But it did not have any success.</p>  <p>Thanks for all help</p>  <p>/Magnus</p>
