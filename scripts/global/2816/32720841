<p>I'm new to NoSQL but have decided to use PouchDB for an Angular Application I am creating.</p>  <p>There are going to be a series of questions (about 1000 in total) which each have their own tags. Each object shouldn't have more that 6 or 7 tags. Example data is:</p>  <pre><code>{     "text": "Question?",     "answers": [         { "text": "Yes", "correct": true },         { "text": "No", "correct": false }     ],     "tags": ["tag1", "tag3"] }, {     "text": "Question?",     "answers": [         { "text": "Yes","correct": true },         { "text": "No", "correct": false }     ],     "tags": ["tag2", "tag3"] } </code></pre>  <p>I'm at a total loss on how I can query the db in order to retrieve only questions that have "tag2" or questions that have "tag1" and "tag3".</p>  <p>I came across the question found at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28806853/how-to-query-pouchdb-with-sql-like-operators">How to query PouchDB with SQL-like operators</a> but can't seem to wrap my head around how it works. I tried to modify it based on my data and I always get 0 results when querying the database.</p>  <p>I guess my biggest struggle is comparing it to SQL when it isn't. Does anyone know how I can go about creating a query based on specific tags?</p>
