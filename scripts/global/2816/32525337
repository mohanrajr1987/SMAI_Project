<p>I am developing a Cordova application and using PouchDB as database, which, when connection is available, replicates all the information to CouchDB.  I am successfully storing simple text and image. I have been trying to store also video and audio, without luck. </p>  <p>The way I store the data is:</p>  <pre><code>    var emo = {         _id: timestamp,         user: uuid,         location: curLatLng,         _attachments:             {                 "image.jpg":                 {                     content_type:"image\/jpeg",                     data: image                 },                 "video.mp4":                 {                     content_type:"video\/mp4",                     data: video                 }         }     };     db.put(emo, function callback(err, result) {         if (!err) {             //console.log('Successfully posted a todo!');         }     });  </code></pre>  <p>I created the "video" more or less in the following way: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26733070/cordova-capture-video-and-retrieve-base64-data">Cordova - Capture video and retrieve base64 data</a></p>  <p>So, at the end its format is blob. </p>  <p>First of all I am not sure if storing audio/video in PouchDB is possible. If it is possible, are you able to spot what I am doing wrong? Should I follow a different approach?</p>  <p>Thanks a lot for your time!</p>
