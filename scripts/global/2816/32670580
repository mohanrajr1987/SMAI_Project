<p>For a JavaScript web app (AngularJS based) I am using PouchDB replicating a CouchDB database on my server. Authentication in PouchDB works nicely with <a href="https://github.com/nolanlawson/pouchdb-authentication/" rel="nofollow">pouchdb-authentication</a>. I want to manage this through a html/js login screen.</p>  <p>However, if the user enters wrong credentials, I receive a <code>401 Unauthorized</code> from the CouchDB server that causes a browser popup asking for credentials. </p>  <p>How can I prevent this ugly Authentication popup and just handle everything from my javascript?!</p>
