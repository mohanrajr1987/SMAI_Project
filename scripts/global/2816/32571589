<p>I am coming to you for advices about modelling data for a webapp, I decided to go with couchdb + pouchdb (cordova app).</p>  <p><strong>Why:</strong> because of the replication mecanism that seems pretty convenient to implement. Seems like I won't even need to use some server programming languages. If I am not wrong, javascript can manage the whole thing.</p>  <p>However, there is a slight problem: like most of people, I come from relationnal database and what would seems pretty easy to implement in MySQL is giving me some headhache with the documents logic.</p>  <p><strong>Basic requirement:</strong> users can browse a list of movies splited by type. When viewing the description of a movie, a user can decide if yes or not he wants to see it. So when each user is seeing a list of movies, some would be tagged as something like "must watch".</p>  <p>A relationnal DB would give me something like</p>  <pre><code>USER(email, first_name, name) MOVIES (id, title, duration, description, type) TOWATCH (email, id) </code></pre>  <p>Using couchDB, what would be the best way to implement this ? Something like below ?</p>  <pre><code>user{ /*this document would be created and updated directly through an app*/     id : /*email of the user*/,     firstname : /*firstname*/,     name : /*name*/,     movies : {         id /*id of a movie*/     } }  movies{ /*this document would be created and updated directly through the server*/     id : /*unique id of a movie*/,     title : /*title of the movie*/,     duration : /*duration of the movie*/,     description : /*duration of a movie*/     type : /*kind of movie*/ } </code></pre>  <p>What do you think ?</p>
