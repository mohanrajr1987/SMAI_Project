<p>CORS is enabled and working. </p>  <p>We have a Cordova App which is syncing fine the first time it connects to the CouchDB. After that the db.sync() is not working. Only if we go offline and online with the Fly-mode it syncs again for a short time. </p>  <p>We have a angular.factory which creates the local pouch db and sets up the sync with our remote couchDB</p>  <pre><code>(function () {  angular   .module('IkasApp')   .factory('pouch', ['$http', ThisFunction]);   function ThisFunction($http) {     PouchDB.debug.enable('*');     var db = new PouchDB('test_suite_db');      var remoteCouch = 'http://estouch.iriscouch.com/_utils/database.html?test_suite_db';        if (remoteCouch) {         var opts = {             live: true         };         db.sync(remoteCouch, opts);     }      return db;   } }()); </code></pre>  <p>We are able to create and update documents in our pouchDB (test_suite_db) but it is not live syncing continuously.  As you can see for yourself a lot of inspiration came from this <a href="https://github.com/orbitbot/pouch-todo" rel="nofollow">github</a>. We are running Pouch 4.0.1. </p>
