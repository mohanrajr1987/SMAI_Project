<p>I use a couch database and I can't create a new db with the name "ad". All the other names I tried don't make any problem. I tried with a smileupps server and with a iriscouch server and the problem is the same (but no problem in local).</p>  <p>I have a "no response" error message in Futon.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/DvYu1.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/DvYu1.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>However, I can create the database with curl:</p>  <pre><code>curl -X PUT https://couch-speech.smileupps.com/ad </code></pre>  <p>Or even create and get documents...</p>  <p>But after that I can't use it in Futon (or Fauxton):</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/xSJ5M.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/xSJ5M.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>When I tried to open it I received this message:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Error: An error occurred retrieving a list of all documents</p>      <p>no response</p> </blockquote>  <p>When I try to call documents from internet (I use PouchDB), I have this error message:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>OPTIONS <a href="https://couch-speech.smileupps.com/ad/?_nonce=1443776580493" rel="nofollow">https://couch-speech.smileupps.com/ad/?_nonce=1443776580493</a>   net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT</p> </blockquote>
