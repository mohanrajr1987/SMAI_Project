<p>I'm using hood.ie for a web app I'm making. I like the simplicity of it however there's something I'm not too sure about.</p>  <p>When retrieving data from the couchDB there is a method: <code>findAll</code> - which as an example looks like:</p>  <pre><code>hoodie.store.findAll('todo')   .done(function(allTodos) {     //do something with allTodos }) </code></pre>  <p>What I was wondering/don't really like is the fact that I'm getting all the items of type <code>todo</code> then filtering down once I have e.g. todo with todays date.</p>  <p>Instead of getting all of them, is it possible to just get ones I actually want.</p>  <p>I know there is a find method but that requires an id which i won't have.</p>  <p>Or do i simply not need to worry about this - is the call to get all data not that expensive (if i had 1000+ records I feel it may be).</p>  <p>Any guidance would be appreciated. </p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
