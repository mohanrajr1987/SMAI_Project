<p>Soin couchdb using nano if you dont know _rev of the document, the only way to update it is to use db.atomic which needs some design documents to be uploaded to couchdb. Am I right? I would like to know if there is any better way to have the atomic update operation with just doing everything on the code base as opposed to upload these design documents in my couchDB separately as well?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
