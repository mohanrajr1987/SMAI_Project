<p>Since CouchDb based databases, like Cloudant, provide a Per-Database security model and not a Per-Document one, I have to go for a Per-User Database pattern in order to fulfill my security requirements. </p>  <p>Considering that in practice, <strong>a single Cloudant account contains all the DBs for a single app</strong> (mix DBs from different apps is a not a good solution to me):</p>  <p>What if I want to create another app? How can I solve this problem?</p>  <p>Should I create a new Cloudant account for each application? Is it possible/feasible?</p>  <p>Are there other ways or best practices to solve the problem?</p>
