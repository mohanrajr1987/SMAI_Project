<p>I'm new to CouchDB. We're going to have millions of documents in our database. I am wondering: is it more efficient to return the 'doc' object from the view, or return just the 'doc.id', and use '&amp;include_docs=true'?</p>  <p>I'm guessing that returning 'doc.id' from the view will take up a lot less disk space for the view index, but might require an added call to the database to get the whole document. In this case, it's a decision between more speed (returning 'doc') or decreased disk space usage (returning 'doc.id').</p>  <p>Is this a correct assumption?</p>
