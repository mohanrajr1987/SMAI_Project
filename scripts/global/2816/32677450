<p>I've built an app that saves records in Local Storage. </p>  <p>I've just recently realize that by design I'm chocking the CPU by blocking the DOM, as I'm reading lots of records from a single key using ng-repeat.</p>  <p>My idea is to migrate to PouchDB, but I think I'm missing some concepts.</p>  <p>Right now my data structure looks like this:</p>  <ul> <li>Key(cars) - Value(objectCar1 - objectCar2 - objectCar3 ...)</li> <li>Key(drivers) - Value(objectDriver1 - objectDriver2 - objectDriver3...)   - </li> <li>Key(records) - Value(objectRecord1 - objectRecord2 - objectRecord3 ... <strong>up to Record70 now, starting to give problems</strong>)</li> </ul>  <p>I've been reading Pouch and CouchDB documentation, and if I were to switch to PouchDB, then I just have to throw objects into the DB willy-nilly and then iterate through it looking for parameters in order to filter?</p>  <p>Right now a NoSQL database looks like a big bag where to store data without much order.</p>  <p>Or am I missing something?</p>
