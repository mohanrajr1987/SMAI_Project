<p>I am using logstash to feed elasticsearch indices data from my couchdb. I have about 20 indices. At this time I have very simple setup. All my data is in different databases in couchDB, e.g., users has its own db, roles has its own db and so on and I have indices for each of the db. For some reason, logstash freezes my system after throwing some errors after running for 10 minutes or so. The errors are related to plugin failure for few indices. I was not able to copy the errors due to freeze. Please advice, how can I resolve the freeze. I'll post errors as soon as I copy those.</p>  <p>The error is</p>  <blockquote>   <p>?[31mA plugin had an unrecoverable error. Will restart this plugin.   Plugin: "cameras",   host=>"127.0.0.1", port=>5984,   sequence_path=>"seq_files\cameras_couchdb_seq", tags=>["cameras"],   debug=>false, codec=>"UTF-8">,   secure=>false, password=>, heartbeat=>1000,   keep_revision=>false, ignore_attachments=>true,   always_reconnect=>true, reconnect_delay=>10> Error: Unable to   establish loopback connection {:level=>:error}?[0m</p> </blockquote>  <p>Many thanks.</p>
