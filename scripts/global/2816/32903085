<p>I'm going to develop an android app which needs very high efficiency even with a heavy weight database. in that case, i thought of having a hybrid database which include both SQL lite and noSQL. Is it possible to do this?</p>  <p>If possible, I need to know what is the best no SQL for my task. I did several researches and came up with Couch DB. but I read this article and I found it interesting to use Sparksee. <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-mobile-Databases-Relational-or-NoSQL-for-android" rel="nofollow">https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-mobile-Databases-Relational-or-NoSQL-for-android</a></p>  <p>Can anyone tell what is the best option for my solution?</p>
