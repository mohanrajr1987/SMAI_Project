<p>I have views in my couchdb databases. WIth logstash config file, can I filter to get only valid documents in my indices in ElasticSearch and not the the views? I have multiple databases in couchdb and I have created indices for all of them. How would my filter look like in my config file? Do I need to create filter for each of the each index meaning for input/output section?</p>  <p>Since the documents that are views, don't have a field "type" in them. I think I do something like this:</p>  <pre><code>filter {  if [type] == "" {  drop { }  } } </code></pre>  <p>But its not working. Can some one shed some light on this?</p>
