<p>I have an installation of three couchdb boxes that have continuous pull replications set up amongst themselves. </p>  <p>Question: If I add a document to, say Box A, I am trying to find out how much time does it for it to replicate from A to the rest of the boxes (B and C). </p>  <p>I want to separate network latency from the time it takes for replicating. </p>  <p>What would be my best set of apis/tools that can help me with these measurements ? </p>  <p>I think _changes feed and update handlers are a start but how can I know if _changes feed is real time ? Are there are parameters I can use to tweak its publish rate ?</p>  <p>Please advise. Thanks in advance.</p>
