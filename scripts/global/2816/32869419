<p>We started having trouble using IrisCouch (our DB went offline for several days with no response to support tickets) so we switched to SmileUpps. This worked fine until today when we "hit" our quota limits.</p>  <p>We promptly paid to upgrade our "hosting" plan but apparently this does not raise the quota. Their site is VERY confusing. Anyone know how I can get this company to take our money?</p>
