<p>In my cloudant database I have objects like these. I'd like to query for objects that based on properties in a nested array.</p>  <p>In the example below, how to I query for all objects where there is a vote with userId=="user1"? The query should return both objects. When I search for userId "user2" it should return the first one as the second object only has vote from user1 and user4.</p>  <pre><code>{     "_id": "1",     "votes": [         {             "userId": "user1",             "comment": ""         },         {             "userId": "user2",             "comment": ""         },         {             "userId": "user3",             "comment": ""         }     ] }  {     "_id": "2",     "votes": [         {             "userId": "user1",             "comment": ""         },         {             "userId": "user4",             "comment": ""         }     ] } </code></pre>
