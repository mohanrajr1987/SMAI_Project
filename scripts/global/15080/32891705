<p>I am trying to make the following selector work with my HTML: </p>  <pre><code>input[type="submit"][value="&amp;nbsp;"]:not(.unwantedIconClass)/*, thisIsAComment*/ </code></pre>  <p>It will not work unless I replace value with actual text (and have the same text in the HTML, of course).</p>  <p>I have tried <code>\007C\00a0\00a0</code> following advice from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2965229/nbsp-not-working-in-css-content-tag">nbsp not working in CSS content tag</a> but it does not seem to work either <em>and</em> makes Eclipse syntax coloring confused.</p>  <p>What I actually want is for the value to be invisible to the user but selectable using CSS. It does not matter what the value actually is. This is because I do not have control about the input tag, only its value attribute.</p>  <p>Any suggestions ?</p>  <p>EDIT -- Since it is part of the problem, I will explain more: The value of my value attribute is actually generated through a custom JSP tag, and that custom JSP tag is enclosed by a <code>layout:submit</code> attribute (Struts Layout).</p>  <pre><code>&lt;layout:submit      styleClass="tooCommonClass"     reqCode="notAReliableIdentifierEither"&gt;     &lt;customTag:message key="keyToPropertyFile" /&gt; &lt;/layout:submit&gt; </code></pre>
