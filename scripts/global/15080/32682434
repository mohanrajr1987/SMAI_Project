<p>I am displaying products in a store. Each product has its own box. I want to lay the boxes out in a grid, 2 per row. However they will also be divided into categories, and so I want to put a full-width heading above each set of boxes which belong to that category. Here is my HTML:</p>  <pre><code>    &lt;section class="product-listing"&gt;          &lt;h2&gt;Category 1&lt;/h2&gt;          &lt;section&gt;first&lt;/section&gt;         &lt;section&gt;second&lt;/section&gt;         &lt;section&gt;third&lt;/section&gt;          &lt;h2&gt;Category 2&lt;/h2&gt;          &lt;section&gt;fourth&lt;/section&gt;         &lt;section&gt;fifth&lt;/section&gt;          &lt;h2&gt;Category 3&lt;/h2&gt;          &lt;section&gt;sixth&lt;/section&gt;         &lt;section&gt;seventh&lt;/section&gt;         &lt;section&gt;eighth&lt;/section&gt;         &lt;section&gt;ninth&lt;/section&gt;     &lt;/section&gt; </code></pre>  <p>And CSS:</p>  <pre><code>.product-listing {     width:410px; height:100%     background:#000; } .product-listing &gt; section {     float:left;     width:200px;     margin:10px 10px 0 0;     background:#ff0000; } .product-listing &gt; section:nth-of-type(2n+2){     margin-right:0; } </code></pre>  <p>And <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/1bc5pjzb/4/" rel="nofollow">JS Fiddle</a></p>  <p>As you can see, the grid works fine until the second h2 element is introduced, after which it falls apart, due to the 2n+2 being thrown off if the last set has an odd number of boxes. Essentially what I need to do is reset the 2n+2 formula after each heading.</p>  <p>Quick and dirty way would be to wrap each set of boxes in a div, but I'd rather not introduce unnecessary markup to the page if I can avoid it.</p>  <p>Is there a cleaner solution?</p>
