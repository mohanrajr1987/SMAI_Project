<p>If you want to select nodes without any children you might think about using <code>:empty</code>. Meanwhile the behaviour of <code>:empty</code> is very annoying as any whitespace will make that rule not apply. <code>:blank</code> selector comes here as a saviour but no browser has implemented it yet.</p>  <p>Do you know of any trick to select elements with no other elements inside?</p>  <p>Just to stimulate your imagination: what about something like <code>.parent:not(:scope &gt; *)</code></p>
