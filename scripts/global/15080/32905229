<p>I am trying to get ":nth-child" class to work with a html table.</p>  <p>I would like different columns to have different text alignments and padding.</p>  <p>I have created a new entry for each child in the CSS with their unique settings but only the first entry works. The remainder seem to completely ignored.</p>  <p>I thought maybe I couldn't adjust more than one child under each other in the CSS the way I have laid it out but have found nothing to say I can't. I feel it may be something to with the way the child is being counted from the parent and that my first entry for the child can be the only one. After that its becoming a child of a child, if that makes sense?</p>  <p>Am I on the right track here or just doing something completely wrong through bad understanding of how it is meant to work?</p>  <p>Any help or a solution would be greatly appreciated.</p>  <p>Here is what I have worked up...</p>  <p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false"> <div class="snippet-code"> <pre class="snippet-code-css lang-css prettyprint-override"><code>table, th, td {   border-collapse: collapse; } table {   width: 70%;   border: 2px solid black; } table td {   border: 1px solid black;   padding-top: 2px;   padding-bottom: 2px;   text-align: center; } table td:nth-child(1) {   text-align: right;   padding-left: 30px;   padding-right: 5px; } ​ table td:nth-child(2) {   text-align: left;   padding-left: 10px; } ​ table td:nth-child(3) {   text-align: right;   padding-left: 10px;   padding-right: 15px; } ​</code></pre> <pre class="snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override"><code>&lt;table&gt;   &lt;tr&gt;     &lt;td&gt;one&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;two&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;three&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;four&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;five&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;six&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;seven&lt;/td&gt;   &lt;/tr&gt;   &lt;tr&gt;     &lt;td&gt;eight&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;nine&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;ten&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;eleven&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;twelve&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;thirteen&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;fourteen&lt;/td&gt;   &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt;</code></pre> </div> </div> </p>
