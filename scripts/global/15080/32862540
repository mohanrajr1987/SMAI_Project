<p>I am not at all getting how to use more advanced css-selectors like + or > But as I am now needing it to prevent too much JS, maybe someone can help me out with this particular situation of this block:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;section class="rf_re1-suche_container"&gt;     &lt;input type="search" placeholder="Your search"&gt;     &lt;button&gt;Send&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/section&gt; </code></pre>  <p>and I wanna do that:</p>  <pre><code>.rf_re1-suche_container input:focus{     background:orange; } </code></pre>  <p>but also for the button. So: If the input has a focus I want the input AND the button to have the same background. How would I do that? Thanks!</p>
