<p>For development and debugging purposes it would be really good to know what is the full chain of CSS I'm asking in methods like:</p>  <pre><code>divElm.element(by.css("article")).element(by.css("tbody &gt; tr")).then(function(elm) {   // is there a way to know here what is the "CSS chain" of 'elm'? }); </code></pre>  <p>If I debug <code>elm</code> I see a <code>locator</code> property with:</p>  <pre><code>locator_: { using: 'css selector', value: 'tbody &gt; tr' }, </code></pre>  <p>But that's only the locator of the last element in the chain.</p>  <p>It would be really useful to have all, like: <code>divElm, article, tbody &gt; tr</code> in this way I'd be able to debug this manually on the page to see if the element really exists or not. </p>
