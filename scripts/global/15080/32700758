<p>To start off I'm relatively new to CSS, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_%28front-end_framework%29" rel="nofollow">Bootstrap</a> and HTML. I want to position a responsive element at the bottom of the screen. So I have this code which makes it behave responsively:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div class="col-sm-12"&gt;     test &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>But how do I get it to stick to the bottom of the page? I already tried ID/ Class selectors with an absolute position. It moved the element to the bottom, but it wasn't responsive anymore.</p>
