<p>Consider the two divs:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;input type="text" id="foo" name="foo" value="a"&gt; &lt;input type="text" id="bar" name="bar" value="b"&gt; </code></pre>  <p>How can I have selector that would select all elements with 'name' as <strong>EITHER</strong> 'aType' or 'bType' (thus selecting both the DIVs above). Is it possible to have a "<strong>regex like</strong>" entry in the selector field?</p>  <p>Something like this (in jQuery) - <code>$([name=foo|bar])</code> ? (I may use IDs as well, here; however, I would like to know more from regex perspective)</p>  <p><strong>EDIT:</strong> </p>  <p>If I may expand the scope of this question (beyond just 'OR'ing the 'name' attribute), can we have regex in the selector statement, or is it so that the selector operators should be sufficient to select all kinds of elements (which would mean that I might have to work more on drafting the correct selector statement)?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
