<p>According to <a href="http://nthmaster.com/" rel="nofollow">http://nthmaster.com/</a>, when styling a range of elements by nth-child, we must do this:</p>  <pre class="lang-css prettyprint-override"><code>:nth-child(n+4):nth-child(-n+8) </code></pre>  <p>If we use only one <code>:nth-child()</code>, then we see that it styles all elements by that formula.</p>  <p>How does each of these two <code>:nth-child()</code> selectors cancel the other's influence on elements which are out of the range?</p>
