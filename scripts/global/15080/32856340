<p>I am working on a nav menu which contains some external url links, There are focus styles associated with the navigation menu , like the menu item gets a background when it is focused. If an item, that is an anchor which points to an external link, is clicked, it opens a new tab and displays the page that is represented by that external link. My  problem is that, even though a new tab is opened when the user comes back to the original tab, he can still see the background behind the clicked nav menu item. There are no :active styles associated with that menuitem. </p>  <p>I created this example in js fiddle to enumerate the problem:<br> <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/bc5yu44v/2/" rel="nofollow">https://jsfiddle.net/bc5yu44v/2/</a></p>  <pre><code>&lt;body&gt;   &lt;a id="selectMe" href="www.google.com" target="_blank" onblur="changeText()"&gt;clcik here&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;/body&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Here you can see that even after a new tab is opened by clicking the anchor tag , the anchor tag does not loose its :focus style, but you can see that text was changed , indicating that onblur event was fired.</p>  <p>can any body point me on how to remove :hover style?, is this possible by only using pseudo selector or it can only be achieved by writing js and toggling the classes?. I have a restriction of not using jquery too. I have tested it in chrome and firefox only.</p>
