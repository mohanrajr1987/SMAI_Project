<p>In Selenium using Python, I have been trying to select text from a DIV selector which has a child element as well.The code looks like this:-</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div class="empty-cart-message"&gt;  There are no items in this cart.&lt;br&gt; &lt;button class="btn btn-blue close continue-button continue-empty-btn tmargin10"&gt;Continue Shopping&lt;/button&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I need the text "There are no items in this cart." only , and I am using <code>find_element_by_css_selector()</code> method.</p>  <p>The problem that I am facing is that apart from the text I need, it also gets the text inside button tag. The code I am using looks like this:-</p>  <pre><code>cart_status=driver.find_element_by_css_selector("div.empty-cart-message").text  if(assertEqual("There are no items in this cart", cart_status)):    cont_btn=driver.find_element_by_css_selector("button.continue-empty-bin")    cont_btn.click() </code></pre>  <p>I am not able to find anything that can eliminate/deselect "Button's" text directly from the method I am using.</p>
