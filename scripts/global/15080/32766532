<p>In css, can select an element that follows an element using the <code>+</code> operator. For example, I can select only inputs that directly follow labels by doing:</p>  <pre><code>label + input {     color: red; } </code></pre>  <p>Is there a way to do the opposite, so like "not adjacent to"? In my example, is there a way to select all inputs that <em>do not</em> directly follow labels?</p>  <p>Edit: It needs to select ALL inputs that don't directly follow labels, including inputs that are in places with no labels whatsoever.</p>
