<p>Given an element with some styling and an additional class (<strong>mywidget_button--disabled</strong>) that works as <em>BEM modifier</em>, <strong>does it has sense, as practice, to use the <em>!important</em> clause?</strong></p>  <pre><code>.mywidget__default ~ .mywidget__button {     border: 1px solid #000; }  .mywidget__button--disabled {     border: 1px solid transparent !important; } </code></pre>  <p>The first class is more specific and wins on the second one, but being the disabling class a modifier that (theoretically) should have more priority than the "common" styling, is it correct to rely on the <em>!important</em> clause?</p>  <p>Or does it make the code prone to spaghetti-headache? </p>
