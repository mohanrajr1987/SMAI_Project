<p>I am developing an Android App (along with API server) with plans to promote it via App Invites (<a href="https://developers.google.com/app-invites/" rel="nofollow">https://developers.google.com/app-invites/</a>). </p>  <p>Currently I see how to create and send invite from installed app itself (using corresponding intent, which app user will turn into email or sms link). </p>  <p>But may I generate such a link separately, at my server-side? So that I register that link at Google API, and send it independently, so that it works just if it was generated in-app? </p>
