<p>I am having issues with integrating an external API from shareasale. I appear to be following their documentation but keep getting a The request is badly formed error and I am not sure why or how to fix that. Here is the git repo, if anyone could guide me to solving this it would be very appreciated.</p>  <p><a href="https://github.com/PatrickArthur/share_scale_api_integration/blob/master/app/models/api_integrate.rb" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/PatrickArthur/share_scale_api_integration/blob/master/app/models/api_integrate.rb</a></p>  <pre><code>Started GET "/" for ::1 at 2015-10-02 14:27:01 -0400  Processing by HomeController#index as HTML  Rendered home/index.html.erb within layouts/application (0.2ms)  Completed 200 OK in 225ms (Views: 9.9ms | ActiveRecord: 0.0ms) </code></pre>  <p>This is what the view says: </p>  <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN""w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd"&gt;;  &lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;TITLE&gt;Bad Request&lt;/TITLE&gt;      &lt;META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" Content="text/html; charset=us-ascii"&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;  &lt;BODY&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bad Request&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt; HTTP Error 400.
