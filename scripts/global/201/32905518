<p>I am building an application that calls a webservice. I treat this web service like any other datasource (DAO pattern). But i have problem with the way a link to the webservice is build.</p>  <p>If the web service ever decides to change something. I need to go deep into the code. I would like to be able to centralize the maintenance of those links.</p>  <p>So the static data of the link like the htt://www.resource.com/ could be replaced in the code with resouceApiName. That has a reference to some sort of Key-val translation somewhere else.</p>  <p>I have been thinking about a txt document on a certain location, but i am not to keen on that (just a feeling i have).</p>
