<p>I've been doing a lot of search about secure my api for mobile apps for Android or IOS.</p>  <p>Almost all examples tell user provides an user id and password somehow in a exchange for a token.</p>  <p>But how to prevent someone else to consume my api without my consent? Face the following scenario: I expose an API, I develop, then, an app for android to consume it, I develop, then, an app for IOS to consume it.</p>  <p>Other developer performs a rev. engineer in my app, creates his own app and starts to consume it without authorization.</p>  <p>How to prevent that?</p>
