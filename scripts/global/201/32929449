<p>The following is a json array as displayed on a website I am using.  As you can see it is information pertaining to stops for a garbage truck route.  I know I can filter individual stops based on the stops Id.  For instance I can append the following to the <code>url: ?filter[id]=3</code> and this will give me only this stop.</p>  <p>Does anyone know how to filter based on the relationship "assignment"? </p>  <p><strong>In other words, how do I filter all the stops that have an assignment of 1?</strong>  </p>  <p>I have checked jsonapi.org and the examples there only deal with the attributes of the base data as I have shown.  I could also use a good generic tutorial that goes in-depth into filtering etc.  Most that I have seen deal with specific API's or are very basic.  Thanks for your consideration.</p>  <pre><code>    { "data": [             {                 "id": "3",                 "type": "stops",                 "links": {                 "self": ""                 },                 "attributes": {                     "sort-order": 1,                     "not-out": null,                     "lid-open": null,                     "picked-up": null,                     "number-of-extras": null,                     "updated-at": "2015-10-03T14:50:39.718Z"                 },                 "relationships": {                     "customer": {                         "links": {                         "self": "",                         "related": ""                         },                         "data": {                         "type": "customers",                         "id": "10"                         }                     },                     "route": {                         "links": {                         "self": "",                         "related": ""                         },                         "data": {                         "type": "routes",                         "id": "9"                         }                     },                     "pickup-location": {                         "links": {                         "self": "",                         "related": ""                         },                         "data": {                             "type": "pickup-locations",                             "id": "11"                         }                     },                     "assignment": {                         "links": {                         "self": "",                         "related": ""                         },                         "data": {                             "type": "assignments",                             "id": "1"                             }                     },                     "notes": {                         "links": {                         "self": "",                         "related": ""                         }                     },                     "photos": {                         "links": {                         "self": "",                         "related": ""                         }                     }                 }             }             .             .             .         ] } </code></pre>
