<p>I am looking for service or a quick solution how to identify quickly if BITCOIN rpc API (<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Original_Bitcoin_client/API_calls_list" rel="nofollow">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Original_Bitcoin_client/API_calls_list</a>) is suitable for other cryptocurrencies. I worked with litecoind and dogecoind and used bitcoin api calls. I am planning to add numerous of currencies to my project if they comply. Of course I can read every altcoin's faq and compile their daemons, but maybe someone have already found something easier?</p>
