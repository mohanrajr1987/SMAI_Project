<p>I am building an API using Laravel which will be used by both my Mobile and Web Applications. I am confused regarding authentication.</p>  <p>Basically the web application will be used by users both in logged in state and visitor state.</p>  <p>How would authentication work in that case? If the API uses username/password to authenticate a user what about visitors?</p>  <p>Also, how do I make sure its the webapp and mobile app thats making a request to the API? How do I ensure that someone doesn't programatically doesn't access the API and its only my apps that can request access to data?</p>
