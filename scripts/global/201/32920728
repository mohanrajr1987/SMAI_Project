<p>I am trying to configure OAuth to use it to access data from the Goodreads API using Clojure and Compojure framework. I basically want to get a list of firends that a Goodreads member has. I should mention that I am new to Clojure and completely new to OAuth and in general to API authentification so I would really appreciate it if it could be explained as simply as possible.</p>  <p>I was trying to use the answer to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32107730/oauth1-in-clojure">this question</a> as a template to configure my OAuth access to the Goodreads API. It uses the <a href="https://github.com/mattrepl/clj-oauth" rel="nofollow">clj-oauth</a> which I tried to use in combination with the answer to the above mentioned question since simply replacing the data from the answer to that question with Goodreads addresses didn't work. This is what I have now but it just returns a 401 error and I have no idea what I am doing wrong:</p>  <pre><code>(def okey "goodreads-key")  (def osecret "goodreads-secret")  (def consumer (oauth/make-consumer okey                                    osecret                                    "http://www.goodreads.com/oauth/request_token"                                    "http://www.goodreads.com/oauth/access_token"                                    "http://www.goodreads.com/oauth/authorize"                                    :hmac-sha1))  (def request-token (oauth/request-token consumer nil))  (oauth/user-approval-uri consumer                           (:oauth_token request-token))  (def access-token-response (oauth/access-token consumer                                                 request-token                                                nil))  (defn test-get []   (let [credentials (oauth/credentials consumer                                        (:oauth_token access-token-response)                                        (:oauth_token_secret access-token-response)                                        :GET                                        "https://www.goodreads.com/friend/user/user-id-number?format=xml")]     (http/get "https://www.goodreads.com/friend/user/user-id-number?format=xml" {:query-params credentials}))) </code></pre>  <p>The clj-oauth says in the Client Example that there should be a callback-uri in the request-token and a verifier in the access-token-response, but since I am not familiar with OAuth I put nil there.</p>  <p>The answer to the above question doesn't use the following lines from my code: </p>  <pre><code>(def request-token (oauth/request-token consumer nil))  (oauth/user-approval-uri consumer                           (:oauth_token request-token))  (def access-token-response (oauth/access-token consumer                                                 request-token                                                nil)) </code></pre>  <p>And subsequently doesn't use the "<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/oauth/request_token" rel="nofollow">http://www.goodreads.com/oauth/request_token</a>"                                    "<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/oauth/access_token" rel="nofollow">http://www.goodreads.com/oauth/access_token</a>"                                    "<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/oauth/authorize" rel="nofollow">http://www.goodreads.com/oauth/authorize</a>" addresses in the <code>consumer</code> nor does it use (:oauth_token access-token-response)                                        (:oauth_token_secret access-token-response) in <code>test-get</code>, but instead replaces those values with <code>nil</code>, but since it didn't work I tried to combine it with the example mentioned on clj-oauth github page mentioned above, but it still doesn't work.</p>  <p>I am simply trying to get a XML response of a member's list of friends from the Goodreads API and any help configuring this would be much appreciated.</p>
