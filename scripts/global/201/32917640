<p>Forgive me for my ignorance, as this could be a simple fix, but I simply don't know exactly what to search. I built a website for a client and was asked last minute to create a page that pulls content from a third-party database. I've implemented it with a Wordpress plugin I was able to find, but randomly, every few days or so, it fails to update. It's supposed to update daily and the database the API pulls from updates on the originator's site on schedule, so I know the problem isn't with the database. What might be the culprit here? Caching perhaps?</p>  <p>Here's the page: <a href="http://gracechurchrolla.com/bible/" rel="nofollow">http://gracechurchrolla.com/bible/</a></p>  <p>Here's the originator's page that does the same thing and provided the API: <a href="https://www.churchofthehighlands.com/bible" rel="nofollow">https://www.churchofthehighlands.com/bible</a></p>  <p>Any ideas?</p>
