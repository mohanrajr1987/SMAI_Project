<p>I've looked at OSM, but honestly, it will take more time to understand it than I have allotted for this task. :(   I'd love to just query and api passing in the country -> usa and state -> newyork, and get a json list of countries/towns in the state!  Does anything make this simple?  It seems like somewhere there has to be a list of these things without worrying about geocoding and boxing bounds of a state..</p>
