<p>I wanted to show this image normal way <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/cDsMl.png" rel="nofollow">http://i.stack.imgur.com/cDsMl.png</a> but need 10 reputation..... sorry :)</p>  <p>On the picture, you can see how followers statistics looks on minter.io</p>  <p>The only way how I imagine I would count the followers change: I would download the list of all he followers every day by the Instagram API to my DB. And after having this history already can calculate any change.</p>  <p>But on minter.io you can have such a graphics after few minutes after registration... How???</p>
