<p>I have been working on an application in java that records video and sends it to another client. I have managed to record the video frame by frame but, i am having trouble sending these frames. I have tried using sockets. However, my ISP doesn't allow me to port forward so, I can't run a socket server on my computer.</p>  <p>I have also tried sending each frame to my dropbox account via the Dropbox api and having another client download these frames from dropbox. However, it takes 5 seconds for a frame to reach the other client.</p>  <p>Is there an API that allows for this?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
