<p>I have a 4.5 Website with Master Page. I have 2 pages Home and Dashboard apart from few other pages . I have provided an option for the users to set a specific page out of these 2 as their landing page ( default page) . This option will save the selection in DB and redirects to the appropriate page next time when the user launches the Application.</p>  <p>Note : No login page in this website. Just uses Windows authentication.</p>  <p>Problem :  1. I cannot write this code to check the configured landing page from DB and redirect in Home Page since clicking on "HOME" page from any other page will again redirect the user to the configured landing page only.  2. When i wrote the code in Session Start of Global.asax it works fine. However when a Session timeout happens before I could redirect them to the Session timeout page this redirect to landing page is getting executed.</p>  <p>Can anyone please provide me some hint / best practice as where I can write this logic to achieve the above said !!!</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
