<p>Writing a function that should display errors on terminal and save them to stderr</p>  <pre><code>die () { echo "$(tput setaf 1) ERROR: $*. Aborting...  $(tput sgr 0)" &gt; &amp;2  exit 1  } </code></pre>  <p>unfortunately this will generate </p>  <pre><code>syntax error near unexpected token `&amp;' `    echo "$(tput setaf 1) ERROR: $*. Aborting...  $(tput sgr 0)" &gt; &amp;2 ' </code></pre>  <p>I understood it was because of the tput but I am not able to figure out why.</p>  <p>I do not really care to have colors in my stderr but I would like to keep them on the display.</p>
