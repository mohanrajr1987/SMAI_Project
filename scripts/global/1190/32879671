<p>Thanks for taking time to read my question.</p>  <p>Having migrated to a new CMS based website, the url structure was significantly different.</p>  <p>// Original Url Structure </p>  <pre><code>http://website.com/products/Product-Name.html http://website.com/categories/This-&amp;-That/ http://website.com/pages/CONTACT-THE-TEAM.html </code></pre>  <p>// New Url Structure </p>  <pre><code> http://website.com/product-name  http://website.com/some-category/  http://website.com/contact-the-team </code></pre>  <p>I spent a lot of time learning about .htaccess, reading through stack exchange and other blogs. I came up with the main code below.</p>  <pre><code>############################################ ## Redirect old site incoming link 301 errors  ##1. 301 url directory structure RedirectMatch 301 ^/categories/(.*)$ https://website.com$1 RedirectMatch 301 ^/products/(.*)$ https://website.com/$1 RedirectMatch 301 ^/pages/(.*)$ https://website.com/$1  ##2. Remove ampersand from url RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d RewriteRule ^(.*)-&amp;-(.*)$ http://website.com/$1-$2 [NE,N,R=301,L]  ##3. Make all urls lowercase RewriteRule ^index.php/(admin)($|/) - [L] RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-s RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} [A-Z] RewriteRule ^ ${lc:%{REQUEST_URI}} [NC,R=301,L]  ##4. 301 /page.html to /page RedirectMatch 301 (.*)\.html$ http://website.com$1 </code></pre>  <p>Point number 2. 'Remove ampersand from url' was worked out with the help of user 'axiac' <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30519712/htaccess-strip-characters-26-from-url?answertab=active#tab-top">.htaccess - Strip characters &#39;%26&#39; from url</a></p>  <p>The above .htaccess code works, but the redirect code '#3.Make all urls lowercase' critically effects forms on the site. It seems that these form post are blank.</p>  <p>I also had some issues in the admin area, with loss of function. The below line declaring the admin area to be ignored fixed this issue.     RewriteRule ^index.php/(admin)($|/) - [L]</p>  <p>Trailing from this line of thought I tried many variations such as below;     RewriteRule ^.+.html$ ${lc:%{REQUEST_URI}} [NC,R=301,L]  This fixed the issue, but the .html only rule means that capitals in the url's for the /categories/ are ignored/not included. </p>  <p>My thoughts are the best method of firing the redirect would be via RedirectMatch 301 rather than a blanket rule. Unfortunately after hours of testing and googling I am unable move forward on this.</p>  <p>Any advice on where to look on how to achieve this would be really appreciated.</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
