<p>still new to Wordpress dev, and found a issue where by a clicked link on the home page </p>  <blockquote>   <p>page_id=123&amp;level=3</p> </blockquote>  <p>But page 123 is restricted to registered users only, so gets redirected to the registration page. The problem is, in the URL on the Registration page you do get this:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>page_id=110&amp;redirect_to=page_id=123</p> </blockquote>  <p>And loses the: &amp;level=3</p>  <p>Using the Theme dt-the7 with userPro plugin to handle the registration, and from looking at other peoples questions regarding this, I am unsure of which core is doing the redirect, so i can ensure it keeps it.</p>  <p>Is it UserPro, WP Core, the Theme or .htaccess ?</p>  <p>Any help and guidance would be very welcome.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>  <p>Addy</p>
