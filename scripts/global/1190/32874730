<p>I understand this question has been asked elsewhere on here but the solutions in those threads have not worked for me. I want to eliminate the trailing slash from my all my site's URLs with 301 redirects but I need this rule to NOT apply to my checkout page (<a href="https://example.com/checkout/onepage/" rel="nofollow">https://example.com/checkout/onepage/</a>), which is an Ajax thing where you advance through 3 steps of checkout process that all take place on the one URL. That URL (<a href="https://example.com/checkout/onepage/" rel="nofollow">https://example.com/checkout/onepage/</a>) is the only time we use https URLs on the site and I'm wondering if that's part of the issue.</p>  <p>The rewrite rule I have does remove my trailing slashes, but does not allow me to advance through the checkout process. Clicking the "Next" button does nothing and eventually times out.</p>  <pre><code>RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/checkout/$ RewriteRule ^(.*)/$ /$1 [L,R=301] </code></pre>  <p>How can I fix my rule?</p>
