<p>I need to redirect some url in my jekyll based website. </p>  <p>I found the jekyll-redirect-from and seems to work nicely with html pages.</p>  <p>But I also have to redirect urls to pdfs and this does not work. </p>  <p>Details:</p>  <p>I have in my _config.yml</p>  <pre><code>gems:   - jekyll-redirect-from </code></pre>  <p>and in a page I have tried the following variations:</p>  <p><strong>this works</strong> and redirects to the html page:</p>  <pre><code>--- redirect_from: "/x.html" redirect_to: "/some-existing.html" --- </code></pre>  <p><strong>this works</strong> and redirects to the pdf document:</p>  <pre><code>--- redirect_from: "/x.html" redirect_to: "/some-existing.pdf" --- </code></pre>  <p><strong>this does not work</strong> it opens the pdf view but then displays an error, about not being able to display the pdf:</p>  <pre><code>--- redirect_from: "/x.html" redirect_to: "/some-existing.pdf" --- </code></pre>  <p>It seems that by the pdf extension the browser decides to start up the pdf viewer which then can't handle the redirect.</p>  <p>How can I fix this?</p>
