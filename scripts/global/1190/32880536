<p>This must be a stupid question, but I was wondering. How do I know if a certain visitor who visit my site came from another site by clicking a redirected link going to my website?</p>  <p>it's like redirecting a traffic.</p>  <p>is it possible to track if that user came from a specific site by clicking a link there going to my site?</p>  <p>Thanks in Advance</p>
