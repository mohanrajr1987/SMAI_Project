<p>I launched a new website using WordPress. Last week, Moz Analytics was saying I have 288 medium issues and I see the warning "<em>45% of site pages served 302 redirects during the last crawl</em>". This week, it went up to 362, but I didn't redirect anything.</p>  <p>I'm on WordPress using Yoast SEO, so all the 301s I did are 301s, not 302s. I do have SSL, could it be HTTP vs HTTPS? When I posted this at <em>moz.com</em>, I received the following suggestion. But when I implemented it, I got the WP white screen of death. I've posted in the <code>.htaccess</code> file of how I did it. It must be wrong, or the code is wrong, but I don't know how to fix it. </p>  <p>This past weekend, I put W3 cache on it and tinypng to compress my images and optimize the site. Google Page speed said my website is loading 30% faster, but now I'm losing rankings again. I didn't redirect any pages last weekend. Is it possible that the W3 cache did it?</p>  <p>Moz response:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>You have a lot of HTTP &amp; HTTPS issues, so you should fix these with a bit of <code>.htaccess</code> code, as below.</p>  <pre><code>RewriteEngine On RewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on RewriteRule ^.*$ https://%{SERVER_NAME}%{REQUEST_URI} [R,L] </code></pre>      <p>You also have some non-WWW to WWW issues. You can fix these in <code>.htaccess</code> at the same time.</p>  <pre><code>RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^www\. RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.%{HTTP_HOST}/$1 [R=301,L]  </code></pre> </blockquote>  <p>This is how I modified it </p>  <pre><code># BEGIN WordPress &lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt; RewriteEngine On RewriteBase / RewriteRule ^index\.php$ - [L] RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d RewriteRule . /index.php [L] RewriteEngine On RewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on RewriteRule   ^.*$https://%{SERVER_NAME}%{REQUEST_URI} [R,L] RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^www\. RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.%   {HTTP_HOST}/$1 [R=301,L] &lt;/IfModule&gt;  # END WordPress </code></pre>  <p>If anyone can help me figure these questions out, I will greatly appreciate it.</p>
