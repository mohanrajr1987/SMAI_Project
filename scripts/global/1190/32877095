<p>1) How to make Apache to redirect the whole url with parameters, and make it visible to a client, for example: when client comes to :</p>  <pre><code>https://domain1.com/app/index.php?device_id=WeWeWe&amp;ordna_ver=5.0&amp;num=+1234567890 </code></pre>  <p>it redirects him to:</p>  <pre><code>https://domain2.com/app/index.php?device_id=WeWeWe&amp;ordna_ver=5.0&amp;num=+1234567890 </code></pre>  <p>2) Also, how to make the same redirect but NOT visible to a client (he still see the URL from domain1.com while opening it from domain2.com) ?</p>  <p>3) And the third, how to make the same two things (redirects) with nginx ?</p>  <p>Thank you very much for your help.</p>
