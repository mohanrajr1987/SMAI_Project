<p>I’m currently experiencing an issue on multiple Wordpress websites hosted on Media Temple.</p>  <p>When I perform an on-page optimisation check on a website called positionaly a major issue is being flagged up. The issue states that there is a “Non-permanent redirect detected" when as far as I’m aware there isn’t one setup on any of these sites.</p>  <p>The weird thing is when I check the website here <a href="http://www.redirect-checker.org/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.redirect-checker.org/index.php</a> a 302 redirect is detected on the first check but not on the second. It seems to be detected randomly.</p>  <p>I’ve checked my htaccess file and that looks okay. Completely stumped. How can I find out what is causing this? </p>
