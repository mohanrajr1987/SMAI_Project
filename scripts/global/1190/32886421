<p>I have three sites enabled on apache2 all using TLS/SSL certificates.  In order to redirect the base dns www.mysite.com to https: I use a Redirect in each virtual host.  All three are exactly the same as follows:</p>  <pre><code>    ServerAdmin me@gmail.com     DocumentRoot /var/www/html/site_folder/     ServerName example.com     ServerAlias www.example.com     Redirect permanent / https://www.example.com </code></pre>  <p>I realize that I do not need to specify the DocumentRoot if I am using a Redirect in this way.</p>  <p>The problem is that two of the virtual hosts work perfectly and always redirect to <a href="https://www.example.com" rel="nofollow">https://www.example.com</a> as they should.  However, one site does not.  It simply redirects to <a href="https://example.com" rel="nofollow">https://example.com</a> (without the www.)</p>  <p>So, I'm totally confused about this.  I need it to redirect properly in order to use facebook login if the user types the base url without https:</p>  <p>I have tried enabling and disabling the site (a2ensite, a2dissite), I have tried also to copy the whole file to a new site and create a new one.  I am completely confused about this.</p>
