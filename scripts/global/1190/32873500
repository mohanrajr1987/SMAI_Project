<p>I have several PDF files on my computer that contain links to other pages.  Those links, however, direct you to the local filesystem instead of the internet.  I.e. clicking the link opens the browser and takes you to <code>file:///page</code> instead of <code>http://domain/page</code>.</p>  <p>Getting these files modified to include the full URL is not an option.</p>  <p>I tried using available Firefox extensions to redirect the URL, but none worked, so I tried creating my own extension to do the same.  What I've found so far is that the URL isn't accessible until the tab's "ready" event fires, but a page referring to a local file is always "uninitialized."</p>  <p>Here's my extension script, almost straight from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/High-Level_APIs/tabs" rel="nofollow">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/High-Level_APIs/tabs</a>:</p>  <pre><code>var tabs = require("sdk/tabs"); tabs.on('open', function(tab){     tab.on('ready', function(tab){         if (tab.url.indexOf("file:///page") != -1) {             tab.url = tab.url.replace("file://", "https://domain");         }     }); }); </code></pre>  <p>Any ideas how to go about redirecting a page from a local file to another location?</p>
