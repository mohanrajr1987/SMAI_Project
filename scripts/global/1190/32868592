<p>I have a <code>.htaccess</code> file that should redirect all requests to <code>index.php?url=$1</code>, Except if the request points to images or specific files. If these are located somewhere undetr the <code>public/</code> folder they should be served. If the requested file is an image somewhere out of the <code>public/</code> folder then it is redirected to a default image, and if the requested file is a HTML, JS, CSS, SWF file and is out of the <code>public/</code> folder a simle <code>404-not found</code> should be sent back. Everything works good except that when I request images from <code>/public</code> or let's say <code>public/images</code> they are redirected to the default image as well. I've tried everything, even the <code>%{ENV:REDIRECT_STATUS}</code> but still the same. Any Ideas how could I make the loop stop If the file has been served in the line 11.?</p>  <p>Here is the .htaccess file:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;       RewriteEngine on     SetEnv HTTP_MOD_REWRITE on     RewriteBase /wsproject/      Options All -Indexes     DirectoryIndex index.php      RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^public/.*\.(html|css|js|swf|jpe?g|png|gif|bmp|ico)$ [NC]     RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -f     RewriteRule ^ - [L]      RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} \.(jpe?g|png|gif|bmp|ico)$ [NC]     RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -f     RewriteRule ^ public/errors/img-not-found.png [L]      RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} \.(html|css|js|swf)$ [NC]     RewriteRule ^ - [R=404,L]      RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^public/.*$ [NC]     RewriteRule ^(.+)$ index.php?url=$1 [QSA,L] &lt;/IfModule&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I use the code from a former answer, you can see here: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32847302/apache-rewrite-module-complex-rules/32849304#32849304">Apache Rewrite module, complex rules</a></p>
