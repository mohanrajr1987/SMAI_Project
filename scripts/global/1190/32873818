<p>Not sure how to pull this off.  Say I have example.com and example2.com.  I want all requests from example2.com to  301 redirect to example.com.  That part isn't hard.  </p>  <pre><code>RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^example2.com [NC,OR] RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www.example2.com [NC] RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.example.com/$1 [L,R=301,NC] </code></pre>  <p>What I would like to do though when someone enters www.example2.com is to have them redirected to www.example.com/a-special-page.html and have everything else redirect exactly as entered.  ie www.example2.com/another-page.html redirects to www.example.com/another-page.html</p>
