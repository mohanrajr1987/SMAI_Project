<p>I'm setting up our blog and I've given up on the complexity of Wordpress. Just need simple static pages.</p>  <p>But one feature I'd like is to be able to have:</p>  <p>OurServer.com/blog/article/1/Long-Article-Name/ And then be able to change  /Long-Article-Name at a future date and/or have someone link to just OurServer.com/blog/article/1/  </p>  <p>(And if the answer is "Use Wordpress" then I can live without this. Just a nice idea)</p>
