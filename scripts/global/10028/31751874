<p>I am using Linq to XML to do an XML export of data. However, when I export longtext and open the XML in Excel, there is extra space in the longtext cells, causing all the cells to be much larger than they need to be and making readability really bad. On inspection, I realized that there was not any additional whitespace in there, the cells were just enlarged for some reason. When I click into the cell and then click out again, it resizes itself to the correct size and the extra space disappears. Any ideas on what is causing this or how to solve thsi would be greatly appreciated!</p>
