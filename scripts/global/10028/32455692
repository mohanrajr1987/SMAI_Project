<p>I have a XML string which contains some chinese characters like <code>�菅࿼Ჽ탽᫴</code>. So When Parsing it with <code>XDocument.Parse</code> it is throwing the below exception.</p>  <p><code>System.Xml.XmlException: '', hexadecimal value 0x01, is an invalid character</code></p>  <p>I tried converting the xml string to <code>UTF-8</code>. But still the same issue.</p>  <p>Any Ideas?</p>  <p><strong>Update:</strong></p>  <p>XML Contains lots of elements in it, but on using the below answer it is ignoring all the other elements but just converting the elements which has special characters, Is there anything can be done with <code>XDocument</code> instead of <code>XElement</code>?</p>
