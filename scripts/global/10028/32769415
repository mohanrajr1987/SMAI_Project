<p>I am trying to create a protégé readable ontology.  I started with a 4GB .nt file and parsed out the needed classes and instances that I wish to use.  Those are stored in memory since I got it down to less than 1 minute and roughly 1GB.  They are in the form of Dictionary> right now.  The next step is to take that data and move it into an OWL Ontology.  Is there anywhere to start with how to manually loop through and do this?  All of my research points me to using Manchester OWL, but everything I can find is for use with existing tools that don't fit my needs.  I am looking for just doing a simple loop probably with LINQ to XML and I am unsure of how to format that or where to look to find how to do this.</p>  <p>Thanks Jimmy</p>
