<p>I am working with a xml schema file that contains complex types with nested choice and sequence tags. Those can be nested inside each other in any way. What I need to do is to execute different methods depending on the first sequence or choice tag. I have no trouble finding a sequence or a choice tag via the .Descendants()-method. But in this case I only get the tag I check for first. </p>  <p>I was thinking to determine the depths of the first sequence and choice tag after a given node and compare them. This way I could determine the highest tag. How can I do this? I can't find a way to determine the depth of a node. Or is there another way to figure out whether a node contains a sequence higher than a choice or the other way around?</p>
