<p>This is probably a simple error on my part but I'm having issues reading a string argument that begins with @ in the context of <code>XML</code>.</p>  <p>For example:</p>  <pre><code>program.exe file.xml @attribute </code></pre>  <p>the <code>@attribute</code> string is the attribute that I need to check for in a join:</p>  <pre><code>var testjoin = from x in tree1 join y in tree2 on (string)x.Attribute(args[2]) equals (string)y.Attribute("Order") select x </code></pre>  <p>but I keep throwing errors "name cannot begin with the '@' character..." from when I try to pass it directly to <code>x.Attribute()</code></p>  <p>Would someone be able to help me solve this?</p>  <p>EDIT:  The <code>XML</code> content of the file is irrelevant. This is for assignment purposes but it is a simple file of Customers that I am comparing with a file of Orders.</p>  <p>The header of the file is</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>The <code>@attribute</code> was literally <code>@CustomerID</code> and I cannot alter how it is passed into my program. I can alter how I process it, so if there is another method I can use to perform a join passing that in as an attribute, I can change that.</p>
