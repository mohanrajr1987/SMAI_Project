<p>I have an XML file with IP addresses and their assigned locations/floors that looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;Locations&gt;    &lt;LOCATION1&gt;       &lt;FLOOR1&gt;          &lt;SECTION1&gt;             &lt;IP&gt;10.10.10.10&lt;/IP&gt;             &lt;IP&gt;etc....          &lt;/SECTION1&gt;       &lt;/FLOOR1&gt;    &lt;/LOCATION1&gt; ..... </code></pre>  <p>What I am attempting to do is get query for an IP address and return the names of the parent elements. I am able to query for that IP but I have not had any luck figuring out how to get the parent elements names (i.e. SECTION1, FLOOR1, LOCATION1). Here is the code I am using for querying xml to find the IP, I just have it returning the value at the moment to verify my query was successful:</p>  <pre><code>var query = from t in xmlLocation.Descendants("IP")             where t.Value.Equals(sIP)             select t.Value; </code></pre>
