<p>I am using SQL Server 2008 R2 and this index in my database was already created:</p>  <pre><code>CREATE UNIQUE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IndexT1  ON T1 (     [ID] ASC,     [logID] ASC ) INCLUDE ([MasterID])  WHERE ([logID] IS NOT NULL) </code></pre>  <p>I executed this query :</p>  <pre><code>SELECT      R.X  FROM     R LEFT JOIN      T1 ON T1.MasterID = R.MasterID WHERE      T1.ID IS NULL      AND R.logID IS NULL     AND T1.ItemID IN (SELECT MAX(R.ItemID)                       FROM R                       LEFT JOIN T1 ON T1.MasterID = R.MasterID                       WHERE T1.ID IS NULL                          AND R.logID IS NULL                       GROUP BY R.MasterID)   </code></pre>  <p>And in the execution plan, SQL Server offer to me to create this index:</p>  <pre><code>CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX [&lt;Name of Missing Index, sysname,&gt;] ON T1 (   [ID],   [logID] ) </code></pre>  <p>Does anybody know what is a difference between those indexes?</p>  <p>Because, I think the first ones cover the second ones! Why my query can not use the first ones?</p>
