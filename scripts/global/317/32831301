<p>I.e. Does something like the following exist?</p>  <pre><code>lst = [["a", "b", "c"], [4,5,6],"test"] print getIndex(lst, "a") &gt;&gt;&gt; 0 print getIndex(lst, 5) &gt;&gt;&gt; 1 print getIndex(lst, "test") &gt;&gt;&gt; 2 </code></pre>  <p>I know of the regular index() method but that only looks for the immediate elements.  I have a rough solution of making a new list, parsing through the superlist and adding "y" or "n" then looking for the index of the "y" in that one, but I feel there is much better way.  Thanks</p>
