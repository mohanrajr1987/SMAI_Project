<p>I'm having an issue inputting a forumla into a cell in my VBA.  I'm just trying to put a simple Index &amp; Match formula into Cell "V2", the code works perfectly fine until I add an IFERROR clause at the begining.  I'm not sure what the problem is because I have the same formula code working above for a different cell.  Here's my code</p>  <pre><code>wsO.Range("V2").FormulaArray = _     "=IFERROR(INDEX('[Blue.xls]2015'!$D$24:$D$209,MATCH(I3&amp;L3,'[Blue.xls]2015'!$A$24:$A$209&amp;'[Blue.xls]2015'!$B$24:$B$209,0)),"""")" </code></pre>  <p>Any thoughts are much appreciated!</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
