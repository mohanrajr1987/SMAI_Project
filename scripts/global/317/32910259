<p>So this is code from a book I am looking at done in Matlab. The model array M is initialized, Q is the norm of the difference of the input vector X and the best-matching model. </p>  <pre><code>M = rand(64,2); % initialization of a 64-model SOM array  Q = zeros(64,1); % quantization error for t = 1:1000000     X = rand(1,2); % training input     % Winner search         for i = 1:64             Q(i,1) = norm(X(t,:) - M(i,:));         end     [C,c] = min(Q); end </code></pre>  <p>I get an error  Index exceeds matrix dimensions.</p>  <pre><code>Error in som1 (line 8)             Q(i,1) = norm(X(t,:) - M(i,:)); </code></pre>  <p>I can see (or think) the error is coming from the indexing of M, but I am not sure why or how I can fix it.  Any ideas or guidance would be much appreciated!</p>
