<p>I am a newbie in partitioning database tables. I have few doubts about indexing and partitioning. </p>  <ol> <li>What will happen to indexes while partitioning an existing table in SQL Server?</li> <li>The index table for all partitions are same or different? If not, do I need to partition the index table?</li> <li>Is it possible to partition tables with express or standard edition of SQL Server 2008 or 2012?</li> </ol>
