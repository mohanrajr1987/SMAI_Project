<p>I have a big dataframe and I need to create a new dataframe only with the data where one index is consecutive to the other.  For  Example:</p>  <pre><code>import pandas as pd import numpy as np indexer = [0,1,3,5,6,8,10,12,13,17,18,20,22,24,25,26] df  = pd.DataFrame(range(50,66), index=indexer, columns = ['A']) </code></pre>  <p>So the desired output in this  case is:     </p>  <pre><code>     A 0   50 1   51 5   53 6   54 12  57 13  58 17  59 18  60 24  63 25  64 26  65 </code></pre>  <p>Is there a fast way of doing it in pandas? or need to do it with some kind of loop and function over each row?</p>
