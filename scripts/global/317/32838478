<p>Our site is <a href="http://www.recordfarm.com" rel="nofollow">www.recordfarm.com</a> and it runs on ajax. Even though we have the proper meta tags, google won't index any of the pages. Shouldn't the pages get indexed since the meta tag info is in HTML?</p>  <p>When we submit our site map to Google Webmaster, it only crawls the site (33,000 URLS) but does not index it. The site has a lot of users, but we are not sure why it is not indexing in google properly. </p>
