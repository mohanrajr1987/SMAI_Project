<p>I have been working on indexing news items from our app for the iOS 9 Spotlight deeplink search feature. Having got the news items successfully indexed, and going to the article when clicked in spotlight, I'd like to read the attributes of the searchable item before I direct them to the article.</p>  <p>Here is the method in AppDelegate for receiving these deep link actions:</p>  <pre><code>func application(application: UIApplication, continueUserActivity userActivity: NSUserActivity, restorationHandler: ([AnyObject]?) -&gt; Void) -&gt; Bool {     if #available(iOS 9.0, *) {         if userActivity.activityType == CSSearchableItemActionType {             let uniqueIdentifier = userActivity.userInfo?[CSSearchableItemActivityIdentifier] as? String              if let path = uniqueIdentifier {                 // Read CSSearchableItem's attributes                 RemoteNotificationDeepLink.sharedInstance.setAction("news",value: path)              }         }     } else {         // Fallback on earlier versions     }      return true } </code></pre>  <p>I am specifically looking for the attributeSet.identifier attribute. After a good search, I haven't found much explaining how to do this, so any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
