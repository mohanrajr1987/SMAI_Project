<p>I have a table with the following field in my DB .</p>  <p>Date/Time , Device ID , Sensor 1 Value , Sensor 2 Value .</p>  <p>This is part of a IOT project where e sensor will send data to the DB every second for data analytics purposes</p>  <p>We initialy set Device ID as an index foreseeing client will use the data from some sensor only. </p>  <p>However, we found that our client mainly requested data based on date (e.g. Data for whole of 2013).</p>  <p>Due to the size of e records , it take days to just run the Select * filtered by datetime query for 1 year of data (Estimated 10 Million Entries).</p>  <p>My question is , does it make sense to index date/time to speed up query since date time field is sorted during insertion?</p>  <p>If so, any suggestion to speed up such a query ?</p>  <p>Thank  you. </p>
