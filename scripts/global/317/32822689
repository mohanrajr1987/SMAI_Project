<p>We have mysql database with auto increment column(id) as primary key for all tables and which is referred in another table as foreign key. We have planned to use index for some of the columns in order to increase the accessing time of the table.</p>  <p>Is it necessary to create index for auto increment column(id) which is referred in another table as foreign key, or by default mysql using index mechanism internally for the column that is referred as foreign key. In any case, If we use index on foreign key, whether it will faster the accessing time ?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.....  </p>
