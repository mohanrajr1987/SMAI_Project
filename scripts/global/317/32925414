<p>Can I somehow index other data types than string in GraphEngine without using any additional indexing software. I can have</p>  <pre><code>cell struct Post {     [Index]     string Title; } </code></pre>  <p>and query the Title index quite fast, but</p>  <pre><code>cell struct Post {     [Index]     int Id; } </code></pre>  <p>causes <code>Index: Substring index is only valid for strings or containers of strings.</code> and without the index queries are quite slow. It seems like <code>[Index]</code> attribute is only for strings. Is there something equivalent for integers? And what about other data types?</p>
