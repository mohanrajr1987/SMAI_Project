<p>I am having Magento CE 1.9 website with 135,000 products, 2500 categories and 8 stores. I have installed Sphinx search for fast searching product catalog and have Nginx server. Also i have full page cache extension installed in it. But still my website is very slow and indexing is killing our time.</p>  <p>Please advise on configuration and solution for indexing. </p>  <p>Especially search indexing is taking more time for my website.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
