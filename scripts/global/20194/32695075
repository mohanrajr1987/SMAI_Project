<p>I was trying to develop a module using BDD i.e. using Cucumber. This is the first time that I am trying this. I have defined two Scenarios in my Feature and using IntelliJ itself, I have created Steps for both the scenarios in a particular file. </p>  <p>However, on running the tests, the runner cannot find steps defined for the second scenario, even though they are in the same file as the steps for the first scenario. </p>  <p>The steps for the first scenario execute without any issues. </p>  <p>===EDIT====</p>  <p>Just to reiterate, the config under which the tests are running has the glue defined which identifies the steps for the first scenario, so it should be able to do the same for the second scenario as well, but doesn't. I have restarted the IDE, but to no avail. </p>  <p>===EDIT 2====</p>  <p>Ok, So now none of the steps are being recognized. Even the steps defined for First scenario are not being found by the runner. </p>
