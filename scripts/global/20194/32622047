<p>I have a few cucumber tests that involve CMS pages done through Comfy (comfortable mexican sofa) CMS in a Rails 4.2.4 app.  </p>  <p>The tests hit my homepage and check for a few links to be present.  The pages themselves are pretty basic with a few links, buttons, images, etc.  Everything passes on my local machine after setting up fixtures in a <code>Before</code> hook, following this guide: <a href="https://github.com/comfy/comfortable-mexican-sofa/wiki/Working-with-CMS-fixtures" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/comfy/comfortable-mexican-sofa/wiki/Working-with-CMS-fixtures</a></p>  <p>I'm using codeship to run my builds.  The cucumber tests which run successfully locally will fail running on codeship.  As far as I've tracked it down, it has something to do with loading the images on the CMS pages.  When I comment out the references to the images on the HTML pages, the tests run successfully.</p>  <p>Is there something I can do to remedy this situation, short of commenting out all of the image references in my HTML before I run on codeship?</p>
