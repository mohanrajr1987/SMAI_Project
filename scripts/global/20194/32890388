<p>I've done a search and most of the related google results have returned just in general selecting an element from a dropdown. However the ID's in this case for the elements in the dropdown are dynamically generated unfortunately.</p>  <p>This is for a base test case, so I basically just need to select for example the first one. The text is also the same for the elements in the dropdown (not sure if that helps).</p>  <p>Is there such an example of this?</p>  <p>Im using cucumber with caybara(using selenium driver) integration</p>
