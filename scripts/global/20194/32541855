<p>I am trying to use assertions (like assert_equal) with Cucumber (not RSpec that is default). It seems that this does not work out of the box, because assert_equal <code>1</code>,<code>1</code> gives me error undefined method <code>+</code> for <code>nil:NilClass</code> (NoMethodError)</p>  <p>According to tips I found I tried to add this to features/support/env.rb:</p>  <pre><code>require 'test/unit/assertions' World Test::Unit::Assertions </code></pre>  <p>But I get this error: <code>cannot load such file -- test/unit/assertions (LoadError)</code></p>  <p>What am I missing here?</p>
