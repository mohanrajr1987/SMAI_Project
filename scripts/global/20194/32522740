<p>I have a step definition file that I want to use in my test project.  When my step definition file is placed inside an included project, all work fine.  But if instead of include the project, I include the jar that correspond to the include project, cucumber don't find step definition class.</p>  <p>this is my annotation glue : </p>  <pre><code>@CucumberOptions(features = "scenarii/connexion/", glue = {         "cucumber.tests, "org.includeProject.cucumber"} ) </code></pre>  <p>The Step definition classes in cucumber.tests are finds by cucumber, but those in org.includeProject.cucumber are not.</p>  <p>Any Idea?</p>
