<p>Is it possible to parameterise a feature file in the same way it is a scenario? So each scenario in the feature could refer to some variables which are later defined by a single table for the entire feature file?</p>  <p>All of the answers I've found so far (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11209066/feature-and-scenario-outline-name-in-cucumber-before-hook">Feature and scenario outline name in cucumber before hook</a> for example) use Ruby meta-programming, which doesn't inspire much hope for the jvm setup I'm using.</p>
