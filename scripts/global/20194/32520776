<p>I'm experimenting with <code>Cucumber/WebdriverIO UI</code> tests using Webstorm (NodeJs platform). At certain steps I would really love to stop it in <strong>debug</strong> mode, check the retrieved element and see what can I do with it.</p>  <p>But unfortunately the <strong>Debug</strong> button is disabled and I couldn't find anything specific in <code>Webstorm</code> documentation as well.</p>  <p>If I can achieve my original goal (stopping a step and experimenting with the elements) without using Webstorm's <strong>Debug</strong> mode, that's totally fine for me.</p>
