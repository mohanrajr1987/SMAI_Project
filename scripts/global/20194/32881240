<p>I currently want to return the rows for the Examples for Scenario Outlines and get the size of the rows, however I am unable to do this as when SpecRun reads the feature files, it automatically converts scenario outline examples into individual scenarios for a custom report we want to create which requires this information. </p>  <p>ScenarioContext.Current.ScenarioInfo does not give me this capability. </p>  <p>When faced with the same issue in JAVA, we implemented gherkin.formatter into a custom class and invoked it in the RunCukesTest class with plugins = {"my.package.customreport"} </p>  <p>However I'm not sure how the same can be done in .Net SpecRun after importing the gherkin.dll. </p>  <p>Could anybody please shed some light on this or give an alternate solution?</p>  <p>Thanks! </p>
