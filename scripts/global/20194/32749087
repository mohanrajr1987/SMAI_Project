<p>I need to connect to a MySQL database.  I've found a gem called "mysql" and one called "mysql2". I tried installing and using both gems and got a message like this:</p>  <pre><code>cannot load such file -- mysql (LoadError) C:/Automation/ta-rb5-portal-cuke/features/step_definitions/common_steps.rb:2:in `require' C:/Automation/ta-rb5-portal-cuke/features/step_definitions/common_steps.rb:2:in `&lt;top (required)&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Which gem should I use and what am I doing wrong?</p>  <p>I'm using Ruby 2.1.7.  </p>
