<p>I'm running tests to render and check a PDF.  I've got it working but the PDF's are date stamped in the filename.  I'm looking for a way to always have today's generated file to be opened.  I've tried the <code>Date.today</code> approach but had no joy as PDF reader doesn't see it as a correct filename. Here is my code so you can see what I'm trying to do:</p>  <pre><code>today = Date.today Given /^I open the saved PDF and confirm the VRM is "(.*?)"$/ do |vrm| filename = 'C:\Users\user\Downloads\vehicle_summary_VRM_#{today}.pdf'     PDF::Reader.open(filename) do |reader|           reader.pages.each do |page|             expect(reader.page(1)).to have_content vrm                 puts page.text     end   end end </code></pre>  <p>I get the following exception: <code>input must be an IO-like object or a filename (ArgumentError)</code></p>  <p>Any ideas?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
