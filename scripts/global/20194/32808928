<p>I'm using meteor-cucumber <a href="https://github.com/xolvio/meteor-cucumber" rel="nofollow">meteor-cucumber</a> in my Meteor project, which in turn uses cucumber.js.</p>  <p>I want the test to navigate to a url, but I am expecting an error if it is invalid. In this case, the valid url is <strong>/articles</strong></p>  <pre><code>this.When(/^I navigate to '\/articles'$/, function () {   this.browser.url(process.env.ROOT_URL, 'articles';  }); </code></pre>  <p>This produces a passing test.</p>  <pre><code>Scenario: View list of articles                     #   features/articles/read_article.feature:8   Given I am logged in                              # features/articles/read_article.feature:9   When I navigate to '/articles'                    # features/articles/read_article.feature:10   Then I should see a list of articles in tile view # features/articles/read_article.feature:11   1 scenario (1 pending) 3 steps (1 pending, 2 passed) </code></pre>  <p>When I change the url to something invalid (eg: 'articlesxxxx', the test still passes. Is this expected behaviour? </p>  <p>I would like the step to fail if the url can't be found.</p>  <p>Related: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1548714/how-do-i-have-a-negative-scenario-with-cucumber-in-rails">How do I have a negative scenario with Cucumber in Rails?</a></p>
