<p>I have very little experience setting up automated testing. I've had success setting up Cucumber on a windows machine and managed to make the example tests pass, but now that I've switched to a Mac, Cucumber spits out this error after trying to run the example tests:</p>  <pre><code>@dev Scenario:                                            Given I am a new user                              When I navigate to "/"                              Then I should see the title "intentional failure"    TypeError: Object true has no method 'getTitle' at World.&lt;anonymous&gt; (features/step_definitions/sample_steps.js:23:9) </code></pre>  <p>I'm not sure what I've done wrong! Any help would be appreciated.</p>
