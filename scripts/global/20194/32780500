<p>I would like to ask about Calabash Automation testing tools.<br> As you know, if we want to auto test app by calabash on Simulator or Real device,<br> we have to run below command for each times.<br> * Simulator :  </p>  <pre><code>cucumber  </code></pre>  <p>*Real Device :   </p>  <pre><code>BUNDLE_ID=com.example.app DEVICE_TARGET=7ezz..a DEVICE_ENDPOINT=http://10.0.1.56:37265 cucumber   </code></pre>  <p>That is the reason we can not bring the device to show the result for other members, is that right ?<br> Because the device should be connected with PC/MAC...  </p>  <p>So, I want I only run above command in 1 times then I can do the testing again.<br> Please help me !<br> Thank you so much !</p>
