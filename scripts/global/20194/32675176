<p>Trying to refactor some test code like <code>Mymodule::Myclass.create...</code> to <code>FactoryGirl.create(:myclass...</code></p>  <p>This change is fine within Rspec spec files, but trying to use the same within Cucumber step definitions is causing tests to fail with data not being cleaned up between runs.</p>  <p>What is so different about <code>FactoryGirl.create</code> and <code>Mymodule::Myclass.create</code> which would have one persist data and not the other between test runs?</p>
