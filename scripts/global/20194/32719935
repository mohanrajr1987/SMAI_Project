<p>I am trying to implement a Cucumber step which can parse a JSON response and store the information for that attribute.</p>  <p>I have JSON responses which have varying layers and I want to be able to pull out any given piece using slashes to "dig down" into it.'</p>  <p>My feature file has the following step</p>  <pre><code>When I save "foo/bar/attribute" </code></pre>  <p>I have my json response stored as @jsonResponse. My step definition is what I could use some help with...</p>  <pre><code>When(/^I save "([^"]*)"$/) do |json|    levels = json.split("/")    parsed_json = ActiveSupport::JSON.decode(@jsonResponse)    parsed_json[?] #how can i access this attribute given the variable input    ... </code></pre>  <p>So I am looking to pull the information in the json out of parsed_json['foo']['bar']['attribute'] but this will change based on the input.</p>  <p>Any insight on this would be much appreciated.</p>
