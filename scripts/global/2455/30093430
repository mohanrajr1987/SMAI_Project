<p>I have a situation where we have several database and a complex event stream that we would like to be able to select from</p>  <p>In the case of live data, this would apply to the CeP who's syntax varies by implementation (Esper v Siddhi v StreamInsight)</p>  <p>In the case of historical data, we may have any thing from an RDBMS to any of several NoSQL solutions; currently in complete flux.</p>  <p>So, to essentially hide what/where the data is coming from and make it webservice friendly I want to masquerade this as JSON; giving me the freedom to choose on the backend how this gets converted to an actual, runnable, thing. Also, by using JSON I can extend the grammer to suit my needs</p>  <p>Here is the JSON I am considering:</p>  <pre><code>{   "select": [{     "field" :"c.id",     "rename":"id"     }, {       "field" :"m.id",       "rename":"id"     },     {       "field": "#sum(c.totalCharge)",       "rename": "total"     }   ],   "from" : {     "Claim": "c",     "Member" : "m"   },   "window" : {     "type" : "ENTITY",     "count" : 10   },   "where" :  [     "OR", [       "AND", [         "GT", "$m.age", 30], [         "LT", "$m.age", 60         ]       ], [       "EQ", "$name", "Bobby"     ]   ],   "join": {     "c.sid": "m.id"   },   "orderBy" : [     "c.sid","m.id"   ],   "groupBy" : "m.lastName"  } </code></pre>  <p>Several things I have considered:</p>  <ul> <li>I am writing this in Java</li> <li>Use Pojo/JSON binding and just construct queries from this normalized form</li> <li>Define grammar for this in ANTLR (each grammar file can be specific to the destination code)</li> <li>Someone may have already done this</li> </ul>  <p><strong><em>Why so many tags?</em></strong></p>  <ul> <li>Did I miss something in the JSON-SQL that might be important?</li> <li>Would it be better easier to implement with a tree listener in ANTLR or</li> <li>Just bind to Java POJO?</li> </ul>  <p><strong><em>What I have looked at</em></strong></p>  <ul> <li>JSLINQ (Almost, but not quite and .NET</li> <li>JSONiq (Doesn't look like it fits the bill)</li> </ul>  <p>If this isn't the right place for this question please direct me to where is. </p>
