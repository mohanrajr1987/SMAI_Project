<p>I'm novice programmer, learning C.</p>  <p>Something that's always confused me is how do people create new programming languages?</p>  <p><strong>Sub/related questions:</strong></p>  <ol> <li>What language do they write it in?</li> <li>Does the language have to be one that in between a high level language and machine code?</li> <li>What are the stages/elements of creating a programming language For example - C or C++(From my basic research I've realised that all programming languages either need a compiler or an interpreter but I don't really understand the difference between the two)</li> </ol>  <p>As I said, I'm a complete novice but I'm really intrigued by programming and really wanna learn more. I'm like a really crap tennis player who wants to know everything about tennis! I searched about it on Google but couldn't get satisfactory answer.</p>
