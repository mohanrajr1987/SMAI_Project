<p>Currently I have been using MATLAB to solve the problems that I have been dealing with. In my MATLAB code, I call CPlex or GUROBI solvers to solve large Linear Programming problems. In each call of my MATLAB code, CPlex or GUROBI  is called more than 10^5 times. This causes a high computational load and it takes too much to solve larger problems. However, I want to switch to another programming language which is,</p>  <ul> <li>capable of calling one of these (CPlex or GUROBI ),</li> <li>capable of calling one of these solvers (CPlex or GUROBI ) too many times (let's say 10^6 times) and in each call without significant reduction in performance and without any significant increase in run time.</li> <li>capable of using dynamic arrays (namely, when I run my code, It will get some user parameters and it will define matrices of different sizes in each run.)</li> <li>capable of defining multi-dimensional arrays, not array of arrays.</li> </ul>  <p>At this point I have found three options</p>  <ol> <li><p>Fortran: It seems quite OK but I have some concerns whether can it efficiently be able to call solvers too many times. It seems that I can only use Fortran with Cplex. I googled Fortran+GUROBI but results were not encouraging.</p></li> <li><p>Visual Basic.NET : It seems that calling both Cplex and GUROBI is possible with Visual Basic but I am not sure about the performance.</p></li> <li><p>Python: Both integrable with CPlex and GUROBI .</p></li> </ol>  <p>In conclusion, I request your suggestions to go forward. My preference is to start with a programming language in which it is possible to use both GUROBI and CPlex.</p>
