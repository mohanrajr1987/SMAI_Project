<p>Most of us have probably encountered the bug of when you add another statement inside an 'if' and notice that it prints regardless of the condition of the branch, only to find out sooner or later in frustration that the braces around the 'if' condition was missing. </p>  <p>Example:</p>  <pre><code>if (condition) {     statement; } </code></pre>  <p>Compared to:</p>  <pre><code>if (condition)     statement; </code></pre>  <p>Please note that I wouldn't want a discussion on what coding standard is better, as we all have our opinion about that and it's very much dependent on context. Instead, I would be interested in the advantages from a programming language point of view and from these advantages, <em>why</em> it was decided not to be strictly enforced. Does it make for a simpler grammar? Compiler implementation?</p>  <p>What is the advantage of leaving it optional, rather than strictly enforcing it? What does the standard say about it?</p>
