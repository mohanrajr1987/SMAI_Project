<p>So I'm planning to make a web-based console-like thing. It's like, there will be buttons, and when a specific button was clicked, it will create a <em>.txt</em> file and write something in it. I wonder what language should I learn that can make a file and edit it like I said. Thanks!</p>  <p>//Edit:</p>  <p>Sorry if I kinda broke the rules. I'm really new here. And by the way, I forgot to tell that I already know a bit of HTML, CSS, and JS, so the UI will not be a problem, all I need is the language that can make and edit a file ( a .txt file to be specific ) </p>
