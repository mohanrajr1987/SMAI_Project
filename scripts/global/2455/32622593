<p>Please help to find code examples for use of <strong>Substructural Type Systems</strong>, as described for example in <strong>Substructural Type Systems</strong> by <strong>David Walker</strong> at <a href="http://camlunity.ru/swap/Functional%20Programming/Type%20Systems/Pierce/Advanced%20Topics%20in%20Types%20and%20Programming%20Languages.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://camlunity.ru/swap/Functional%20Programming/Type%20Systems/Pierce/Advanced%20Topics%20in%20Types%20and%20Programming%20Languages.pdf</a>.</p>  <p>Wanna see examples on specifying the order of use of functions|methods of some iface|type|class. Like that for files the file should be first opened for read, then in loop of any size (including 0 times) read or got any info like current pos current length, then closed. How such a protocol is written in <strong>Substructural Type System</strong> programming languages?</p>  <p>If the question should be asked elsewhere please help to know where.</p>
