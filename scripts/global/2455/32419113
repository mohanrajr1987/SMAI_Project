<p>I don't know anythin about frameworks and I know a very little about programming. I have access to an Ubuntu live USB and windows 7. I would like to learn how to make a website just like this one : <a href="http://en.battleship-game.org" rel="nofollow">http://en.battleship-game.org</a> . I would prefer to be able to do as much of this as possible myself, like hosting it on a server of my own and such and I would prefer not to simply have a program do it all for me. I have heard MySQL, node.js and php are good for serverside and some other things, but end all, I would just like to know what languages I should learn to be able to make a site like that and what operating system, programs(IDE's/compilers) and language I should learn to setup a server for a site like that.</p>
