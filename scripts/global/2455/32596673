<p>I have found similar posts but I am trying to be more specific to my case. I want to develop a GUI based application that can be used on Linux but I will use Windows to develop it.</p>  <p>I used VisualBasic 6 about 10 or 11 years ago and I found it was very easy to develop GUI apps. Now I am more familiar with Python. So I want to ask is there a way to develop a GUI app using:</p>  <ul> <li>an easy drag and drop environment like Visual Basic</li> <li>If it runs python behind the scene it will be more easy for me</li> <li>It should support Linux and windows</li> </ul>
