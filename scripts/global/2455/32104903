<p>I am looking to make a key logger application which needs to be able to run on windows/mac/linux operating systems. I am debating with myself on which is the best programming language for the task. Important things I am considering are:</p>  <ul> <li>Ability to run on Unix like systems and Windows  </li> <li>Good language api for key-logger code</li> <li>Programming language difficulty (aka coding time consumption) </li> </ul>  <p>Given this set of criteria which language would you recommend and why? </p>
