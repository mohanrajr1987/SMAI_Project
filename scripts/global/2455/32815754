<p>I'm having some problems with a true and false question for my programmling languages class.  </p>  <p>Problem 2 (16 points). Answer the following True or False.</p>  <p>a. It is possible for a λ-calculus term to have more than one normal form. - false<br> b. A term that normalizes using a lazy evaluation strategy may not normalize using an eager evaluation strategy. - true<br> c. It is possible for two terms M and N to have α-equivalent normal forms, even if M and N are not α-equivalent. [true?]<br> d. It is decidable whether two syntactically unequal terms have α-equivalent normal forms.   [true?]</p>  <p>For c and d I think they are true, but I am truly unsure.  It is hard to find much information about this online and any help would be great.</p>
