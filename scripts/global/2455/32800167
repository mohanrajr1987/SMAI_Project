<p>I know this question has been asked a million times but Can someone please explain to me what ADT exactly means (in layman's terms if possible) ? </p>  <p>I read this definition of ADT- <em>ADT only mentions what operations are to be performed but not how these operations will be implemented</em>. So is the case with primitive data types. </p>  <p>Suppose if we have a float data type, we know that multiplication, division, etc. operations can be performed (so we know <em>what operations</em> will be performed) but we don't how it'll be performed (in case of multiplication we can just multiply or repeatedly add, so we have two processes giving the same result and therefore it's abstract). So both data types are essentially the same. (I know it's incorrect).</p>  <p>I know I'm getting it all wrong. Can someone please help me clear this concept? </p>
