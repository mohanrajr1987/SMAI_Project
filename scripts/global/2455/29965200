<p>I need a mainstream language that supports continuations. Java never will (breaks <code>finally</code>), <a href="https://github.com/scala/scala-continuations" rel="nofollow">Scala has deprecated it</a>, ruby is silently <a href="http://www.atdot.net/~ko1/pub/ContinuationFest-ruby.pdf" rel="nofollow">deprecating it as well</a>...</p>  <p>Does any other mainstream, non FP-only language support them and does not plan to deprecate it? I actually need the ability to jump back in the code°.</p>  <p>° that's for a PhD thesis, not a production app :-).</p>
