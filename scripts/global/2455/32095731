<p>I learnt both of these languages I choose Java because I got it is simple to understand and not difficult . My classmates were saying Java is so much difficult language even faculty too which teaching C# . I keep in my mind this is myth.  Because Java is reliable and better ever.  So I love Java.  Am I right about this ? I want to know .</p>
