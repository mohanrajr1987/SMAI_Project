<p>I am trying to understand tthe associativity of operations when it comes to floating points. In the lecture notes i have, the following is stated:</p>  <p>"suppose floating-point values store seven digit of accuracy.  Considee the problem of adding 11 numbers together, where one of the numbers is 10^7 and the other ten are 1.</p>  <p>If the small numbers (the 1s) are each added to the large number, one at a time, there is no effect on that number, because  the small numbers occur in the eighth digit of the large number ". So here I understood  that the result is 1,000,001.</p>  <p>"however, if the small numbers are first added together and the result is added to the large number, the result is a seven-digit accurancy 1.000001 * 10^7" </p>  <p>But both approaches seemed the same to me: we are adding the 10 numbers to the larger number. Can someone please clarify this problem ? Thank you</p>
