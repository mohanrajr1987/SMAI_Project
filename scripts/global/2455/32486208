<p>So, I am implementing a context sensitive syntactical analyzator. It's kind of experimantal thing and one of the things I need are usable and practical syntactical contructs to test it on.</p>  <p>For example the following example isn't possible to parse using standard CFG (context free grammar). Basically it allows to declare multiple variables of unrelated data types and simultaneously initialize them.</p>  <pre><code>int bool string number flag str = 1 true "Hello"; </code></pre>  <p>If I omit a few details, it can be formally described like this:</p>  <p><code>L = {a<sup>n</sup>b<sup>n</sup>c<sup>n</sup> | n >= 1}</code></p>  <p>So, I would appreciate as much of similar examples as you can think of, however, they really should be practical. Something that actual programmers would appreciate.</p>
