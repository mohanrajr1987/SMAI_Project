<p>I'm reading <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00365999">a journal article about Real-Time Concurrent C</a>, and it mentions in the abstract (so any of you can see the context through that link as well) that "Concurrent C, is a parallel superset of C (and of C++)".  </p>  <p>Now I know what a superset is, but what do they mean by a "parallel superset" when referring to programming languages?</p>
