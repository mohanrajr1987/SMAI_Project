<p>Recently I was challenged by a friend to create a snake game much like the classic Nokia version using the C++ language. </p>  <p>I have been programming in Java, but unlike Java, C++ doesn't seem to have standard gui libraries. </p>  <p>Therefore after looking into GUI for C++ many different api are available. </p>  <p>Which one would be best for this task? </p>  <p>I use Linux, so something that is cross platform with Windows would be beneficial. </p>
