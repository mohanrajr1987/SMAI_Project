<p>My background in programming MCU's is limited due to this being my first year. We've spent time learning a bit of assembly and I got familiar with programming a PIC16F84 for quite simple tasks. My interest then deviated to how people at Intel go about programming their processors. Do they use assembly or a much lower-level language (that they possibly wrote themselves)?</p>  <p>Second part of this question; what is the limit on high-level languages before it becomes stupid to use (i.e does programming a microcontroller in python give a massive disadvantage over the more favoured assembly/C)?</p>
