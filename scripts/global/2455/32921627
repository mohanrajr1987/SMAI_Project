<p>Given some set of numbers say 4 a,b,c,d is there a way of writing a java programs, finding the lowest common multiple of all two set of numbers, a and b, a and c, a and d, b and c, b and d, c and d. finding also the lowest common multiple of all three sets of numbers; a, b and c, a, b and d, a, c and d, b, c and d lastly finding the common multiple of a, b, c and d. Is there anyone who also can generalize it to n sets of numbers: n=(2,3,4,5...) .  To give a clue to the programmer is easy to no that giving the number n the number of ways of carving two sets out of n is nC2, the number of ways of carving three sets out of n is nC3 in general the number of ways of carving r (2,3...) sets out of n is nCr.  please help....</p>
