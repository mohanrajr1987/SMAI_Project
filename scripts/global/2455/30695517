<p>I found a small C function that given a matrix, it removes the line 0 and the column 'i' and then put it in another matrix,</p>  <p>everything in order to calculate the determinant of the simplified matrix , but I have not ever seen a matrix column size like this:</p>  <pre><code>void togli_riga0_colonnai(double mat [][dim], int n, int i, double matreduced[][dim])   {    int j, l;   for(j=1;j&lt;n;j++) {     for(l=0;l&lt;n;l++) {       if(l!=i)     matreduced[j-1][l-(l&gt;i)]=mat[j][l];          }     } } </code></pre>  <p><strong>within the '>' sign.</strong> Can anyone tell me what it could mean and when is it used? Thanks in advance</p>
