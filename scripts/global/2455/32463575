<p>I really need the name of a programming language I forgot about. Here are the specifications about the language:</p>  <ol> <li>It was a high-level language (easy to use)</li> <li>It was a language used for graphic purposes, if I remember right it was more used by artist-coders</li> <li>I learned it just before Java because it looks quite similar but it's easier, therefore I learned it to be "ready" for java</li> <li>If I'm not wrong it was related to universities?</li> <li>I have a vague memory the name was close to an actual word, starting with "E" (I think, like 50% sure) and the logo was blue as well as the website</li> </ol>  <p>I hope you guys will be able to help me find the language back, I need it for a friend that tries to start with coding.</p>  <p>PS: I'm sorry if this post isn't in its right section.</p>
