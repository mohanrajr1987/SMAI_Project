<p>I want to asking you about multiple programming language. For now I am familiar with javascript (dhtmlx library) and php. Learning basic of these languages take couple weeks. But if I want do this, do that (advanced level) take more time, months even years. Three years ago, I am familiar with VB.net. Because I want to focus with php, never touch vb.net and forgot almost everything. When looking for IT programmer jobs, requirements "asp.net, java, vb.net, nodejs, php". </p>  <p>For me sometimes write var myVar in php. How can someone mastering so many languages and remember all syntax? </p>  <p>Please your advice. </p>  <p>Sorry for my english</p>
