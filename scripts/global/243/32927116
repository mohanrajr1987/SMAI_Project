<p>I have a web page (Django form) that has about 150 questions, each question has a code (e.g. P10, P20, P30, etc), in Django, i know that i can set the verbose name with the code before label, but i want to wrap the question code in span before label, so i did it in javascript this way:</p>  <pre><code>(function ($) {     $(window).load(function(){         $('label[for="id_interview_date"]').prepend('&lt;span class="code"&gt;P.20&lt;/span&gt;');     }) }) (django.jQuery); </code></pre>  <p>but the problem now this file contains about 150 lines of code, and it's taking long time for the page to load, and to load the codes before the label. </p>  <p>What is the best way to achieve this with less lines of code? </p>
