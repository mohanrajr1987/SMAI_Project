<p>I need to create a web app where users can register and have their own profiles. </p>  <p>For the registration part, there is django-allauth. </p>  <p>For the user profile part, do I need to write my own UserProfile model based on Django's User module? Are there django packages for us to customize User Profiles without writing one by our own? If yes, please let me know. It is good to not reinvent the wheel.</p>
