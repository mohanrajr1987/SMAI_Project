<p>I want to pass a 'success' message to the post, after a new comment is added. Here are the views:</p>  <pre><code>@login_required def add_comment(request, post_slug):        p= Article.objects.get(slug=post_slug)     cform = CommentForm(request.POST)     if cform.is_valid():         c = cform.save(commit = False)         c.post = p         c.body = cform.cleaned_data['body']         c.author = request.user         c.save()             messages.success(request, "Comment was added")       else:             messages.error(request, "Comment Invalid!")       return redirect('article.views.post_withslug', post_slug=post_slug) </code></pre>  <p>and </p>  <pre><code>def post_withslug(request, post_slug):     post = Article.objects.get(slug = post_slug)     comments = Comment.objects.filter(post=post)     d = dict(post=post, comments=comments, form=CommentForm(),               user=request.user)     d.update(csrf(request))     return render_to_response("article/post.html", d) </code></pre>  <p>The problem is that, messages are not displayed immediately after redirecting to post with new comment. They are displayed however, when I navigate to other pages. </p>  <p>I guess this is because the <code>context_instance = RequestContext(request)</code> is not properly conveyed from comment to post views. So I tried other redirect methods like <code>render_to_respons</code> and <code>redner(reverse(</code> , but could  not manage to solve the issue. So appreciate your hints.</p>
