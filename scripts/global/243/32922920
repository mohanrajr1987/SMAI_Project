<p>I'm creating a standalone Django app that I want to package up and import into a Django project using pip. However my app contains generated static files - CSS, JS, etc which are generated using Gulp. I want to include these in my app but I'm not sure the best way to do this. I don't want to include the generated files in my version control therefore I figure I have 2 options:</p>  <ul> <li>Run my gulp command to generate the files whenever the python package is installed and include them as part of the python package (I tried overriding the <code>install</code> command in <code>setup.py</code> but couldn't get it to work)</li> <li>Run my gulp command from within my project (however I don't think this will work because the JS/CSS files that gulp requires will be stored inside the <code>site-packages/</code> of my installed package)</li> </ul>  <p>Has anyone done something similar to this or have any suggestions?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
