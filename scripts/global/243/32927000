<p>I am not able to access the server set up by Django on IP 0.0.0.0:8000. The debug mode is True. I ran the server with the following command - </p>  <pre><code>python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000 </code></pre>  <p>I've allowed the python access for both private and public network.</p>  <p>Now when I access the server via another computer with its local IP address, that was '192.168.1.104:8000', I get redirected to the 503 error template.</p>  <p>Is it not supposed to work with DEBUG = True? and if it shouldn't then what should I write in 'ALLOWED_HOSTS'?</p>
