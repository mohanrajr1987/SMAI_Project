<p>I'm working on a new Django project and building an API using the Django REST Framework. I'm trying to enable a view that is <strong>only accessible when <code>DEBUG=True</code></strong> that will serialize the current urlpatterns and send them back as JSON so front end developers can work with it.</p>  <p>I'm looking for a clean way to do it. I can iterate through each pattern, but a pattern could potentially have an unlimited number of subpatterns, so I need some method that can handle that. </p>  <p>Is there something built in for this? Any way besides just brute forcing the URLs? I can write it from scratch, but there must be a better way since the Django 404 page contains this information. I'll dig through that source code as well.</p>  <p>Note: Complexity and security are not an issue since this entire view will only be available when the system is in <code>DEBUG</code>.</p>  <p>The result I'm looking for is something like:</p>  <pre><code>{     "^admin/": [                   "^$ [name='index']",                   "^admin/ ^login/$ [name='login']",                   "^admin/ ^logout/$ [name='logout']",                   ...                ],     "^auth/": [ ... ]     .     .     . } </code></pre>
