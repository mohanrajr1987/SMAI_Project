<p>I have two dropdown list say, "questions" and "choices" in django admin. Depending on the selected option in "question", options in "choices" will get populated. I wrote a javascript that gets triggered on question change, as shown below. To populate "choices", I need to query the database. Can I do that from this javascript function? If yes, how?</p>  <p>Alternatively, if I could return the selected value to the ModelForm class in django admin, I could query database from there. But I am unable to capture this return value in ModelForm and populate "choices" field after user selects an option in "questions". How do I do that?</p>  <p>I could not find any answer on the internet. All I found was sending data from javascript to django views through HttpResponse. This approach also needs a separate regex definition in urls.py. I cannot change the url while I communicate with javascript.</p>  <p>test.js</p>  <pre><code>function tryCustomiseForm() {     choice=django.jQuery('[id$=choice_list]');     var selection = null     django.jQuery('[id$=question_list]').change(function() {         selection = this.value;     });     return selection }  (function($) {    $(document).ready(function() {       tryCustomiseForm();    }); })(django.jQuery); </code></pre>
