<p>I have my game in spritebuilder, and I am trying to move a ball up every 0.005 seconds. I have an <code>NSTimer</code> doing that, but sometimes <code>ball.position.y + 2</code> is different.</p>  <p>For instance, one time I play the game, the ball moves to the top of the screen at the speed I want it to. Then, without even closing the game, just opening the scene again, the ball moves at half of the speed, as if <code>+ 2</code> isn't as much at that time, or the <code>NSTimer</code> decides to run at half speed.</p>  <p>NOTE: This only happens on an actual device. I can't get it to happen in a simulator.</p>  <p>Does anyone know why this is happening?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>  <p>EDIT: My code (abridged):</p>  <pre><code>timer2 = NSTimer.scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval(0.005, target: self, selector: "updateTick", userInfo: nil, repeats: true) </code></pre>  <p>My update function:</p>  <pre><code>func updateTick() {     ...     incrementBalls()     ... } </code></pre>  <p>My <code>incrementBalls()</code> function:</p>  <pre><code>for index in 0...balls.count - 1 {     balls[index].position = ccpAdd(_physicsBody.position, CGPoint(x: balls[index].position.x, y: balls[index].position.y + 2)) } </code></pre>
