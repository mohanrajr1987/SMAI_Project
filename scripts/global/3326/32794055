<p>I am trying to write code for an entity which hops from one side of the page to the other until it reaches a boundary, at which point it turns and hops to the opposite direction. 4 and -4 are my boundaries and also maximum position on either side.</p>  <p>Examples on how position is supposed to change:</p>  <ul> <li><p>Starting position 0 with direction 2: 0 > 2 > 4 > 2 > 0 > ... But instead I am getting 0 > 2 > 4 > 0 > -2</p></li> <li><p>Starting position -1 with direction 2: -1 > 1 > 3 > 3 > 1 > ... But instead I am getting -1 > 1 > 3 > 1 > -1</p></li> </ul>  <p>I'm importing my position and direction from a scanner method. This is the part of my code I am having trouble with: </p>  <pre><code>    public void methodSample() {      if (position + direction &gt; 4) {         position = 8 - (position + direction);         direction = - direction;     }      if (position + direction &lt; -4) {         position = -8 - (position + direction);         direction = - direction;     }      else {         position = position + direction;     }} </code></pre>  <p>But I am getting completely irrelevant values when I run the code. It would be great if anyone can spot where I'm going wrong with my code.</p>
