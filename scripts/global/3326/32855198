<p>I'm not sure if this is possible or not. I'm interested in being able to find the (x,y) position of a word of text on a <code>WinForm</code>.</p>  <p>For example, in the picture below, I want to be able to pull the (x,y) coordinate of the upper-left hand corner of the letter H in "HERE".</p>  <p>I know how to get the position of textbox, so I can make a rough estimate based off of where the word "HERE" is inside the textbox, but I would like to be able to just ask the program where the word is if that is possible.</p>  <p>Also, if there is a way to get that position, I'd like to be able to get the length and height of the word (Basically I want to know the coordinates of the bounding box of the word "HERE" if possible)</p>  <p>Not sure if this matters, but the textbox is a <code>richTextBox</code>, and the textbox is populated from a string array in the <code>Form1</code> class.</p>  <p>Thank you in advance!</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Pvq6b.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Pvq6b.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
