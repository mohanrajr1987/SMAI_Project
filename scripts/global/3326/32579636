<p>Say I have a string like:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>my $refseq="CCCC-TGA---ATAAAC--TCCAT-GCTCCCCC--------------------AAGC";</p> </blockquote>  <p>I want to detect the positions where "-" occurs and the number of contiguous "-". I want to end up with a hash with "-" position as key, and extension length as value, for this example above:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>%POSLENGTH = (5 => 1, 8 => 3, 14 => 2, 19 => 1, 27 => 20);</p> </blockquote>  <p>Note that the positions should be given based on the string without "-".</p>
