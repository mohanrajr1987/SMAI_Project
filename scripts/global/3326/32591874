<p>IÂ´ve made quite many listeners and never really thought of it until now. </p>  <p>Basic Listview listener:</p>  <pre><code>listView.setOnItemClickListener(new AdapterView.OnItemClickListener() {         @Override         public void onItemClick(AdapterView&lt;?&gt; parent, View view, int position, long id) {             Toast.makeText(getActivity(), "you clicked on: " +  position + " id: " + id, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();          }     }); </code></pre>  <p>According to <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/AdapterView.html" rel="nofollow">documentary</a>:</p>  <p>position is: The position of the view in the adapter.</p>  <p>id is: The row id of the item that was clicked.</p>  <p>Could someone good-hearted explain the difference for me.</p>  <p>Thx in advance..</p>
