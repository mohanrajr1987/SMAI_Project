<p>My website is in English and is written from left to right. Translate the site into any language which is written from left to right it's not a problem - just go to the code and change the text. The problem that I want to translate it into Hebrew that are written from right to left. I translated the website texts (buttons and menu), the problem that the structure of the site is left to right. What is the easiest way to fix this? When I tried to change the code to move the placement of things I got into trouble a lot.</p>
