<p>I have these three elements: </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/eZkKb.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/eZkKb.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Now, my layout mandates that element <code>.b</code> (by the way, if it's important, they're all html <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>s) is somewhat superimposed on element <code>.a</code>. So I decide to apply <code>position: relative</code> to it, then nudge it up using <code>top: -50px</code>. </p>  <p>What happens is this:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/kh8kZ.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/kh8kZ.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I successfully superimposed the two top elements, but now I created an unnecessary 50px space between <code>.b</code> and <code>.c</code>. (They were supposed to be glued together.) </p>  <p>My first guess was to apply an equivalent <code>margin-bottom: -50px</code>, but this didn't work, for some reason I'm also not aware.  </p>  <p>Eventually I resolved it in a roundabout way by making <code>.b</code> a child of <code>.a</code>. This caused <code>.a</code> to overflow above <code>.c</code>, but then I applied a magic number amount of <code>margin-bottom</code> to it in order to push <code>.c</code> back down. </p>  <p>Of course, I'm not happy with this solution, so I'm asking here. </p>  <p>What would say is the best way to resolve this? </p>  <p>By <strong>best way</strong> I mean I want to avoid, if possible: </p>  <ul> <li>the creation of additional nonsemantic markup </li> <li>applying the same <code>top: -50px</code> rule to all subsequent elements on the page</li> <li>using any kind of magic number on my CSS.</li> </ul>  <p>I just want to learn the best practice when dealing with this, because I assume it's going be a problem I will be encountering more times in the future. </p>
