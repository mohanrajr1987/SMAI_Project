<p>Trying to do a transition effect where when the user first enters the page, the div 'caption' starts out 100px below it's final resting position and animates upwards. This is the code I'm using in my CSS, but it doesn't seem to work.</p>  <pre><code>.caption { padding: 0 0 0 0; transition: padding 0.25s ease-in-out 1.0s 0 0 100px 0; } </code></pre>  <p>I believe you can animate padding as well as top. Tried both approaches but neither worked. What would here?</p>
