<p>I'm using .Net c# winforms. I want to move my mouse over another application and see the cusor X,Y position as I move the mouse over it's interface. Displaying the X,Y on my forms title bar is ok. I want to see the X,Y location for a specific spot on this app's form.</p>  <p>The reason I want to do this is because there are controls on this app's interface that I can mouse click on to turn a knob, one mouse click per knob turn. I want to write an app that I can position the mouse cursor to that specific X,Y position on this app form and then do a software mouse click to turn that same knob one turn. But I want to do this from my app, kind of like remote control I guess you could say. The other app knobs responds to mouse clicks when you are over the correct X,Y location.</p>  <p>Thanks for any pointers in the right direction.</p>
