<p>This is somewhat a duplicate of other questions so apologies in advance but I haven't been able to make sense of the existing answers (probably because I'm a WPF newb). </p>  <p>I have a grid within a canvas. The grid is added programmatically, not in xaml and is much smaller than the canvas. I want to programmatically add a control (text box) at the position the user clicks on the grid. The application may or may not be full screen and users screen resolutions may differ. </p>  <p>Currently I'm using a mouse down event and getting a point:</p>  <pre><code>Dim p As Point = Mouse.GetPosition(myGrid) </code></pre>  <p>And then using the point.x and point.y with Canvas.SetLeft and Canvas.SetTop but this only works when the app is full screen and the screen res is consistent.</p>  <p>I know it's bad form to ask for code but please include a snippet in your answer as I've been wrestling with this for some time &amp; going round in circles. I'm using VB but answers in any language will be welcome. Thanks very much.</p>
