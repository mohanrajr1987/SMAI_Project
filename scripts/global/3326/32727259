<p>I'm implementing a fixed vertcial menu, it works great on desktop and looks great on mobile devices (IOS, Android) ...as long as you don't zoom in on the page. When you zoom on a mobile device the fixed element begins covering the other page content (as it should since it's fixed to a certain place on the viewport). but where i'm looking for is a navigaton bar that's only fixed vertically. So if you zoom in and scroll horizontally the navigation bar doesn't cover the content. Is there a way to do this?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
