<p>I'm working on a wordpress blogging site locally. I added Google Translate and wanted in in my top menu. I positioned it absolute. When a new user registers, an element drops down from the top telling them to check their email for their password. When that element is activated, it pushes the page down but the absolute element overlaps this box. I'm still learning JS and just don't know enough yet to make a conditional script that runs an positon script.. if that's even how it would work!</p>  <p>This is the css for the element:     #glt-translate-trigger{     position: absolute;     top: 14px;     right: 0px;     bottom: auto;     margin: 0 3% 0 5%;     background: #c3d73f;     }</p>  <p>This is the script that activates the notification element:</p>  <pre><code>jQuery(document).ready(function(){ jQuery('.frontend-notification').addClass('shown');  jQuery('.frontend-notification i.fa-times').on('click', function(){ jQuery('.frontend-notification').addClass('hidden'); setTimeout(function(){ jQuery('.frontend-notification').remove(); },2000); }); }); </code></pre>
