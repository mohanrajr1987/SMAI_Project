<p>When does in WPF takes <code>this.WindowStartupLocation = WindowStartupLocation.CenterOwner;</code> effect? </p>  <p>I want this as the default behaviour but if some window-layout information exists (Top, Left, ...), i want to set them in the <code>Loaded</code> event of the window. But this does not work correctly. </p>  <p>If i comment out <code>WindowStartupLocation</code>, it works.</p>  <p>Maybe some one solve this problem before. Thank you!</p>
