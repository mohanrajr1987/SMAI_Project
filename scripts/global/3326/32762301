<p>I am making a widget where i want to set texts and images at a specific position. I want an output like UCCW widgets. I have tried frame layout, relative layout, and canvas but nothing works like it. Whenever i resize the widget from 2x2 to some odd size like 4x2 then the positions of texts mess up. I want to know how to set them at specific positions and how do they automatically resize when the widget size is changed without any issue.</p>  <p>Image for reference:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/7L1Q0.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/7L1Q0.jpg" alt="Image for reference"></a></p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
