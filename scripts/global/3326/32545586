<p>So this is what's going on. I have an SKSpriteNode that isn't global. I make an ivar called <code>_button1</code>, and set it to be <strong><em>equal</em></strong> to the private SKSpriteNode. Later (in<code>-touchesEnded</code>), I want to find out what <code>_button1</code>'s position is. It works properly at the start-up of the game, except that when <code>-touchesMoved</code> changes the position of <code>_button1</code>, it isn't recognized in the <code>NSLog()</code>. To make things less complicated, here's some code snippets and some explanations.</p>  <p><strong>1. I have an SKSpriteNode that cannot be accessed except in the for-in statement it's defined in.</strong></p>  <pre><code>SKSpriteNode *button = [SKSpriteNode spriteNodeWithImageNamed:@"Test"]; </code></pre>  <p><strong>2. I also have an instance variable called <code>_button1</code> that can be accessed wherever.</strong></p>  <pre><code>@implementation MainMenuScene {   SKSpriteNode *_button1; } </code></pre>  <p><strong>2. I set <code>_button1</code> to be equal to <code>button</code>.</strong></p>  <pre><code>_button1 = button; </code></pre>  <p><strong>3. I log the position of <code>_button1</code> using <code>NSLog()</code>, inside of <code>-touchesEnded</code>.</strong></p>  <pre><code>NSLog(@"1 Position.x =\t%.2f", _button1.position.x);  Output: "1 Position.x = 250.00" </code></pre>  <p><strong>4. <code>-touchesMoved</code> causes <code>_button1</code> to move.</strong></p>  <p><strong>5. I log the results again, but the position change hasn't been recognized.</strong></p>  <pre><code>NSLog(@"1 Position.x =\t%.2f", _button1.position.x);  Output: "1 Position.x = 250.00" </code></pre>  <p>So what's going on here? I've tried multiple solutions, as well as re-setting the position to be its current position, re-setting <code>_button1</code> to be equal to <code>button</code>, etc. But it isn't working. What am I doing wrong?</p>
