<p>I want to absolutely position a div at the top and bottom of a scrolling area so they stay in place while I scroll inside the div.</p>  <p>They the scroll area has <code>position: relative;</code> set and the div's I want pinned to the top and bottom are absolutely positioned at <code>top: 0;</code> and <code>bottom: 0;</code></p>  <p>Initially they are positioned as expected but when you scroll they scroll inside the scroll area.</p>  <p>Here is a code pen showing my problem: <a href="http://codepen.io/JoeHastings/pen/wKJzNb" rel="nofollow">http://codepen.io/JoeHastings/pen/wKJzNb</a> </p>
