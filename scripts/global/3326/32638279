<p>Is there a way in which i can hide the 'red circle' node in the first place, and then after a set of time in unhides in a different position within the rect, i would like to do this on a timer so the node disappears and appears in different locations each time within the rect at different time intervals?    </p>  <pre><code>let rect = CGRectMake(8, 293, 165, 218)     let x = rect.origin.x + CGFloat(arc4random()) % rect.size.width let y = rect.origin.y + CGFloat(arc4random()) % rect.size.height let randomPoint = CGPointMake(x, y) self.redcircle.position = randomPoint self.addChild(redcircle) </code></pre>
