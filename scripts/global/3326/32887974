<p>In rails 4 I have a list of todo items where I can add a new todo item and it will display in descending order on my project show page. </p>  <p>I'd like to be able to add a new todo item at a specific position, with the option of adding it above or below an existing todo item with the use of an add button. I would then like this set position to be stored in the database (MySQL)</p>  <p>I imagine I can use some basic css to create a show on hover for the button and I've added a position column to my todo item, but I can't seem to figure out the best way to go about adding a todo item to a specific position. </p>  <p>I've watched the 'Sortable Lists' Railscasts and have been scouring the web for something more specific without any luck. </p>  <p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. </p>
