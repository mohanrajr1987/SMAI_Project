<p>I am having trouble loading jquery in the modal popup window as it is loaded in the main window and some functions in the modal don't work if I don't reload jquery in modal body. I have also tried loading two separate versions of jquery (one on main page &amp; other on modal body) with jquery noconflict.</p>  <p>Code on modal window:</p>  <pre><code>        &lt;script src="&lt;?php echo base_url();?&gt;/assets/js/jquery-2.1.4.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;     &lt;script src="&lt;?php echo base_url();?&gt;/assets/js/bootstrap-datepicker.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;  &lt;script&gt;   var jQuery2_1_4 = $.noConflict(true);       jQuery2_1_4 (document).ready(function () {         jQuery2_1_4 ("input[name='due_date'],input[name='collect_date']").datepicker({                         startDate:"+0d"                 });      }); &lt;/script&gt; </code></pre>  <p>The problem is that now the start date option works in modal but the selected value from the datepicker disappears from the input as soon as the datepicker is closed and the form can't be submitted (it's a required field). Upon inspection, I've found that this is probably a conflict between the two jquery files.</p>
