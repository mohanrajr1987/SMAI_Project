<p>I am starting a new application in which I want to implement CodeIgnitor 3. I need a front-end website and admin panel. But want to use same CI installation, instead of having two CI instances. </p>  <p>I want to run url like this, <code>http://example.com/</code> and admin panel will live at <code>http://example.com/adm/</code>.</p>  <p>How to setup it in CodeIgniter 3? Please advise?</p>
