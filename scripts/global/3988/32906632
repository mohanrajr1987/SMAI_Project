<p>I am working on web application, which I split into two apps</p>  <ol> <li>developed in Codeigniter (CI) PHP framework (its a main database)</li> <li>eCommerce app developed in OpenCart</li> </ol>  <p>both have different databases and registration process, different users profiles.</p>  <p>I have to allow communication between these web apps, have to exchange data and maintain track of user's access. User of eCommerce app can access CI app and user of CI app can access eCommerce app and have to maintain session.</p>
