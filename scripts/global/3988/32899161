<p>I am trying to get the values from <code>timespan()</code> function in Code Igniter. I have one problem, how can I know whether each of the date format is displayed? For example in regards with the codes below, one timespan might be <code>2 Months, 6 Days, 13 Hours, 14 Minutes</code> which would have 4 elements but another might be <code>2 Months, 1 Week, 3 Days, 4 Hours, 39 Minutes</code> which has 5 elements. If do the <code>preg_replace</code> then I won't know which are the months or weeks or days etc.</p>  <p>So how do I find out if it is the week or days or hours etc? Because I want to convert the values into cycles like <code>39mins/1440mins</code> would be 0.0270833 days, then I will calculate for the hours days weeks months and years and add all of them together</p>  <pre><code>// Hold Cycle Time Conversion  foreach($results as $key =&gt; $values) {     // Convert mysql timestamp to unix     $remove = array('-', ':', ' ');     $hold_timestamp = mysql_to_unix( str_replace( $remove, '', $values['hold_date'] ) );      // Get timespan     $hold_timestamp = timespan($hold_timestamp);      // Explode into arrays     $timestamp_format = explode(',', $hold_timestamp);      // Check each array to get value     foreach($timestamp_format as $ts)     {         $separated_stamp = preg_replace('/[^0-9]/', '', $ts);          /*** Stuck here, incomplete ***/     }  } </code></pre>
