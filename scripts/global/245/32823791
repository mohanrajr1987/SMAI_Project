I would like to add conditional formatting to the results to make it easier to find.</p>  <p>For example, if I type "tax" instead of "taxiing," results that have a partial match will populate as module numbers, Lesson 1, Lesson 2, etc. Now I would like the items in Column B to be highlighted that partially match "tax."</p>  <p>How do I go about doing this? </p>
