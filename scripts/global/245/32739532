<p>Why won't this printf statement work with a method call? I would like to format the roundoff errors from the BMI math calculation.</p>  <pre><code>System.out.printf("Your BMI is: %10.2f\n", calcBMI(user_AGE,user_WEIGHT,user_HEIGHT));       public static double calcBMI(int age, double weight, double height){ //        Calculate BMI by dividing weight in pounds (lbs) by height in inches (in) //          squared and multiplying by a conversion factor of 703. //        BMI formula: weight (lb) / [height (in)]2 x 703  //        preconditions: ****         double BMI = weight / Math.pow( height,2)*703;         return BMI;     } </code></pre>
