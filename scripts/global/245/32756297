<p>Here is my day to day work.</p>  <ol> <li>Click printscrn button of the test application. </li> <li>Paste in MS word doc</li> <li>The application has atleast 15 pages to print, so 15 screenshots pasted in one word doc.</li> <li>Save this word doc</li> <li>Since all the images are in bmp format (default win7) the doc size is huge.</li> <li>I need to upload this doc to a server that allows upto 10MB per file size. Most of the time file size is over 10MB.</li> <li>So I split the doc and upload. Its time consuming and i have lot of docs to upload.</li> </ol>  <p>Question; </p>  <p>Is there a way to change the default paste option for print screen button on win7 machine, to jpeg format? The default option is bmp and when pasting the image it consumes lots of space.</p>  <p>Thanks Lloyd</p>
