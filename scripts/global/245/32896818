<p>I developed a Java printer application such that a kitchen POS printer (thermal printer) will print out incoming orders if new order came in the cloud database.</p>  <p>I developed and tested everything on my Mac (2011 Macbook Pro, Yosemite). Seems working well. After that, I was trying to deploy this application in a Ubuntu 14.04, </p>  <p>The problem is that:  The starting point of the text is about half inch to the left edge of the thermal paper, but everything looks good using my mac.</p>  <p>Additional Information: 1. IntelliJ IDE, Java 1.6 compiler on Mac, and OpenJDK 1.6 on Ubuntu 2. Modified these two parameters: Paperformat.getImageableX and drawString(testString, x, y), both modifications of parameters failed to push the text to the left boarder of the paper.</p>  <p>I'm wondering if some Java expert could show me a way out. Thanks!!</p>
