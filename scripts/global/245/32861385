<p>I am not sure if this is the right place to ask this question, and if I am wrong please excuse me, and advise me where section shall I post this.</p>  <p>I want to build website like <a href="http://www.recharge.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.recharge.com/</a> and other International mobile recharge websites. But I do not know where I become an agent for International Mobile Recharge/Top Up so that I can build website like recharge.com.</p>  <p>I have searched at Google about agent for International Mobile Recharge/Top Up. I found website like <a href="http://www.cysend.com/merchant/en/recharge-values-by-country/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cysend.com/merchant/en/recharge-values-by-country/</a> and <a href="https://www.cysend.com/merchant/en/merchant-registration/" rel="nofollow">https://www.cysend.com/merchant/en/merchant-registration/</a> and but this is not for agent, this is for merchant and too expensive for startup fees, API application and White Label who I can sell under my own brand.</p>  <p>I want to get website who receive agent for International Mobile Recharge/Top Up without there are no startup fees, minimal deposit 50 USD for sale again and provide API application for integration to my website. In Indonesia, I found system programs like no startup fees and minimal deposit 50.000 IDR = 5 USD for sale again. And format for mobile recharge uses SMS to recharge/top up mobile phone in transaction. Example : Code dot Mobile Phone Number dot Agent PIN.</p>  <p>Do you know where is website like that ?.</p>
