<p>I am currently writing my thesis and I want the current chapter appears on the top of every even page, on the left side.</p>  <p>However one of my chapter headings is rather long and it runs in 2 lines, which looks terrible, so i started working with fancyhdr.</p>  <p>Now the problem is, that simply changing "fancyheadoffset" is not enough so I need to make "headwidth" wider as well. However I don't manage to make thos two things work together...</p>  <p>Here is my what I tried in a minimum example:</p>  <pre><code>\documentclass[a4paper,10pt,twoside]{extarticle} \usepackage{fancyhdr} \begin{document} \pagestyle{fancy} \fancypagestyle{plain}{%   \fancyhf{}%   \renewcommand{\headrulewidth}{0pt}%   \fancyhf[lef,rof]{\thepage}% } \fancyhf{} \renewcommand{\headrulewidth}{0pt} \renewcommand{\headheight}{23pt} \renewcommand{\headwidth}{1.7\textwidth} %\fancyheadoffset[LO]{0.1\textwidth} \fancyhead[RE,LO]{\leftmark} \fancyfoot[RO,LE]{\thepage} \section{The multivariate stochastic volatility model of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type} \end{document} </code></pre>  <p>So the question is: How can I manipulate both headwidth and the offset,</p>  <p>Thanks</p>  <p>Paul</p>
