<p>I'm working on a buffer overflow project and need to convert a hex address string that is inputted into a usable hex address that I can overwrite a return address with.</p>  <p>I need to convert a string that looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>0x1234abcd </code></pre>  <p>into a string formatted like this (backwards by byte)</p>  <pre><code>\xcd\xab\x34\x12 </code></pre>  <p>but each byte must be treated as a hex value, not literally '\xcd'. So the output if I printed the string would be the four characters that correspond to each byte.</p>  <p>All of my solutions have outputted simply the string '\xcd\xab\x34\x12' rather than treating them as hex values. Thanks!</p>
