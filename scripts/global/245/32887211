<p>I'm fairly new to VBA and am working at a financial firm. My job is to streamline a quarterly reporting process, which involves moving some data and then inserting the required metrics for the analysis. Essentially you take data that is listed as:</p>  <p>Equity     QTR YTD 1YR 3YR ... Since Inception Inception Date</p>  <p>Benchmark  QTR YTD 1YR ... Since Inception "__________"</p>  <p>The Benchmarks do not have an Inception date, so the loop looks for the missing field there, then if it is missing moves the metrics to the same line as the original equity and deletes the line. I've gotten that far, but now I'd like to add all the metrics in order to complete the performance report. My code is as follows:</p>  <pre><code>    Sub offset()         Dim sh As Worksheet         'Integers         Dim i As Long         Dim k As Long         'Movers         Dim current As Range         Dim first As Range         'Metrics         Dim QTRA As Range         Dim YTD As Range         Dim yr1 As Range         Dim yr3 As Range         Dim yr7 As Range         Dim yr5 As Range         Dim yr10 As Range         Dim SI As Range         Dim QTR As Range         Dim YTD_2 As Range         Dim yr1_2 As Range         Dim yr3_2 As Range         Dim yr5_2 As Range         Dim yr7_2 As Range         Dim yr10_2 As Range         Dim SI_2 As Range         'Strings         Dim QTRAs As String         Dim YTDs As String         Dim yr1s As String         Dim yr3s As String         Dim yr7s As String         Dim yr5s As String         Dim yr10s As String         Dim SIs As String         Dim QTRs As String         Dim YTD_2s As String         Dim yr1_2s As String         Dim yr3_2s As String         Dim yr5_2s As String         Dim yr7_2s As String         Dim yr10_2s As String         Dim SI_2s As String          'Finds the length of the data         Dim rn As Range         Set sh = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Comparative Performance1")         Set rn = sh.UsedRange         k = rn.Rows.Count + rn.Row - 1          For i = 2 To k             'Setting variables for each respective data column             Set current = Sheets("Comparative Performance1").Range("J" &amp; i)             Set first = Sheets("Comparative Performance1").Range("B" &amp; i)             Set QTRA = Sheets("Comparative Performance1").Range("S" &amp; i)             Set YTD = Sheets("Comparative Performance1").Range("T" &amp; i)             Set yr1 = Sheets("Comparative Performance1").Range("U" &amp; i)             Set yr3 = Sheets("Comparative Performance1").Range("V" &amp; i)             Set yr5 = Sheets("Comparative Performance1").Range("W" &amp; i)             Set yr7 = Sheets("Comparative Performance1").Range("Y" &amp; i)             Set yr10 = Sheets("Comparative Performance1").Range("X" &amp; i)             Set SI = Sheets("Comparative Performance1").Range("Z" &amp; i)             Set QTR = Sheets("Comparative Performance1").Range("AA" &amp; i)             Set YTD_2 = Sheets("Comparative Performance1").Range("AB" &amp; i)             Set yr1_2 = Sheets("Comparative Performance1").Range("AC" &amp; i)             Set yr3_2 = Sheets("Comparative Performance1").Range("AD" &amp; i)             Set yr5_2 = Sheets("Comparative Performance1").Range("AE" &amp; i)             Set yr7_2 = Sheets("Comparative Performance1").Range("AF" &amp; i)             Set yr10_2 = Sheets("Comparative Performance1").Range("AG" &amp; i)             Set SI_2 = Sheets("Comparative Performance1").Range("AH" &amp; i)             'Moves the benchmarks if it is missing a creation date             If current = "" Then                 Range(first, current).Select                 Selection.Copy                 Range(first, current).offset(-1, 9).Select                 ActiveSheet.Paste                 'I have it deleting the entire row, which may remove necessary data, not sure yet                 Rows(i).EntireRow.Delete             End If             'First we have to create strings for all of the formulas using the variable i             YTDs = "=C" + CStr(i) + "-L" + CStr(i)             yr1s = "=D" + CStr(i) + "-M" + CStr(i)             yr3s = "=E" + CStr(i) + "-N" + CStr(i)             yr5s = "=F" + CStr(i) + "-O" + CStr(i)             yr7s = "=G" + CStr(i) + "-P" + CStr(i)             yr10s = "=H" + CStr(i) + "-Q" + CStr(i)             SIs = "=I" + CStr(i) + "-R" + CStr(i)             QTRs = "=S" + CStr(i) + "/B" + CStr(i)             YTD_2s = "=S" + CStr(i) + "/B" + CStr(i)             yr1_2s = "=U" + CStr(i) + "/D" + CStr(i)             yr3_2s = "=V" + CStr(i) + "/E" + CStr(i)             yr5_2s = "=W" + CStr(i) + "/F" + CStr(i)             yr7_2s = "=X" + CStr(i) + "/G" + CStr(i)             yr10_2s = "=Y" + CStr(i) + "/H" + CStr(i)             SI_2s = "=Z" + CStr(i) + "/I" + CStr(i)             'This should assign all of the metrics using the correct variables             Range(YTD).Formula = YTDs             Range(yr1).Formula = yr1s             Range(yr3).Formula = yr3s             Range(yr5).Formula = yr5s             Range(yr7).Formula = yr7s             Range(yr10).Formula = yr10s             Range(SI).Formula = SIs             Range(QTR).Formula = QTRs             Range(YTD_2).Formula = YTD_2s             Range(yr1_2).Formula = yr1_2s             Range(yr3_2).Formula = yr3_2s             Range(yr5_2).Formula = yr5_2s             Range(yr7_2).Formula = yr7_2s             Range(yr10_2).Formula = yr10_2s             Range(SI_2).Formula = SI_2s         Next i     End Sub </code></pre>  <p>I am getting the error on the first formula assignment line. From what I have learned in VBA so far it seems to me like this should work. Can anybody offer any assistance here?</p>
