<p>Here is the official Tableau tutorial "Changing Date Level Dynamically" that I followed : <a href="http://kb.tableau.com/articles/knowledgebase/changing-date-level-dynamically" rel="nofollow">http://kb.tableau.com/articles/knowledgebase/changing-date-level-dynamically</a></p>  <p>It allows to create a parameter to choose to display your data between "Weekly", "Monthly", and "Quarterly".</p>  <p>However, the format of the data is always "exact date". I would like to switch between, not only "weekly", "monthly" and "quarterly" but also the format of the column (x-axis) between "week number"(1,2....52), "month" (January, February...) and "quarter" (1,2,3,4).</p>  <p>I would really appreciate your help.</p>  <p>Thank you in advance.</p>
