<p>I have acquired a huge codebase in which the previous developer(s) did not follow 80 characters length. I am trying to for a really long lines into multiple lines with continuation. This is a <code>IDL</code> language.  </p>  <p><strong>Before</strong> </p>  <pre><code>test_function, variable1, variable2, variable3, variable4, variable5, variabl6, variable7, vaiable8, variable9, variable10, ... </code></pre>  <p><strong>After</strong></p>  <pre><code>test_function, variable1, variable2, variable3, variable4, $     variable5, variable6, variable7, variable8, variable9,  $     variable10 </code></pre>  <p>I have used <code>formatprg</code> and <a href="http://vimcasts.org/episodes/formatting-text-with-par/" rel="nofollow">par</a> for formatting a paragraph. I am looking for a way so that it will break the line (intelligently) at about 80 characters at <code>comma</code> (and possibly add continuation ($) sign). It will be a huge time saving, as I do not have to break these 1000's of lines to 80 characters manually. </p>  <p>Thank you. </p>
