<p>I had a very complex excel sheet which has data for 201507, 201508 ect. I have used the format function (YYYYMM) and the Edtate function to make unique references.</p>  <p>So I can look up 201507Tomases data and 201508Frank. This all works well for my English office. When I sent it to my companies German office the YYYYMM of my format breaks because it does not understand it. Anyone have any idea </p>  <p>PS the format in German is JJJJMM - I could set up another sheet an alter all the date reference but this would be very time consuming </p>
