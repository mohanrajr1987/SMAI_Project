<p>I want to know if there is a way to get the format that is currently being used by the system. As of now i am using the Joda Time library and manually specifying the foramt that i expect the date to be in.</p>  <pre><code>private final DateTimeFormatter formatter = DateTimeFormat.forPattern("yyyy-MM-dd"); LocalDate date = LocalDate.parse(event_date, formatter); </code></pre>  <p>This is of course not the best idea to hardcode the pattern,so is there a way i can get the pattern from the system?</p>
