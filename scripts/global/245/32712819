<p>I want to create a network in Weka with quite a lot of data. I have looked at the documentation for the .arff format, and there I found relational attributes, but I can't find any info about adding other relational attributes within a relational attribute. Basically, what I'm wondering is if the format bellow would work.</p>  <pre><code>@relation testData  @attribute name {first, second, third} @attribute levelOne relational     @attribute levelTwoFirst relational         @attribute someData1 numeric         @attribute someData2 numeric         @attribute someData3 numeric     @attribute levelTwoSecond relational         @attribute someMoreData1 numeric         @attribute someMoreData2 numeric         @attribute someMoreData3 numeric @attribute predictMe {One, Two Three} </code></pre>
