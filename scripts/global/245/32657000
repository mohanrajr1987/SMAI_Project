<p>I'm trying to create a function that will take a string and display it.</p>  <pre><code>(defun closing (s)   (format t "~{~a~}" ("Sincerely," "\n" s))) </code></pre>  <p>What I hope to get is</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Sincerely,</p>      <p>Frank</p> </blockquote>  <p>if "Frank" is the string I passed in. It complains of the variable S is defined but never used. What am I doing wrong?</p>  <p>Trying to use format alone: If I declare <code>urname</code> as a defparameter to be "Frank", the following doesn't print Frank, rather just the variable name. (Without quote it complains of urname not being a function.)</p>  <pre><code>(format t "~{~a~}" '(urname urname urname)) </code></pre>  <p>How can I feed variables to format?</p>
