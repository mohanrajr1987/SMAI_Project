<p>I would like to know how to do a simple request to join tables in tables. In this case, I want to search all articles which has an Article_Informations that has an Article_Dates which attribute "date_deb" is "0000-00-00". This is simple in this case because for now I just want to search Articles that has Article_Informations, but latter I will have to make queries for Articles that contains Article_nv1 that contains Article_nv2, and then the Article_informations will be associated with Article, Articlen_v1 in article and articlen_v2 in articlenv1. </p>  <p>for the "simple" case, I tried with "join" but it will only reach Article_Informations, I tried with "with", and with "whereHas" like this</p>  <pre><code>$articles=Article::with("Article_Informations")     -&gt;whereHas("Article_Informations", function($query){         $query-&gt;with("Article_Date")-&gt;whereHas("Article_Date",function($query){             $query-&gt;where("date_deb", "=", "0000-00-00");         });     })-&gt;get(); </code></pre>  <p>but unfortunately I can't make whereHas work without with, and in the "whereHas" close I can only put "where"</p>  <p>is there a simple way to do it with only one query, or have I to write an entire algorithm ?</p>
