<p>I have a very basic problem using Laravel 5.1 and Eloquent.</p>  <p>For the sake of simplicity, i've reduced my issue with this example : I have 2 models :</p>  <p>Leads: </p>  <pre><code>ID  |  name  |  fk_city </code></pre>  <p>Cities:</p>  <pre><code>ID  |  name  |  postalcode </code></pre>  <p>In Leads.php model :</p>  <pre><code>public function city() {     return $this-&gt;belongsTo('\App\Models\Cities','fk_city'); } </code></pre>  <p>I would like to sort the leads on the city's name.</p>  <p>I've tried the eagger load orderby :</p>  <pre><code>Leads::with(['city'=&gt;function($q) {     $q-&gt;orderby('name','desc'); }])-&gt;get(); </code></pre>  <p>But it doesn't affect the results.</p>  <p>I've also read that we must use the "join()" statement and manually tells Eloquent what to do. It seems overkill as this kind of sort is a really basic stuff that any ORM must be natively able to do.</p>  <p>Thank you for your ideas :)</p>
