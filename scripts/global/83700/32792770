<p>I'm trying to get the link karma (like reddit does) of a user and display it on his profile page.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>user: id, name, email, password..</p>      <p>posts: id, user_id, title, link, text...</p>      <p>votes: id, user_id, post_id...</p> </blockquote>  <p>I need to be able to get the sum of "value" field in "votes" table of all the posts submitted by the user</p>  <p>This is what I'm using now and a quick <code>dd($user)</code> will retrieve all the post and votes by the user. But using <code>{{ $post-&gt;votes-&gt;sum('value') }}</code> on the view will retrieve the sum of each post separately and not all of them together. How can I do that?</p>  <pre><code>public function show($user)     {         $user = User::whereName($user)-&gt;with('posts.votes')-&gt;first();         return view('user/profile')-&gt;with('user', $user);     } </code></pre>  <p>Note that <code>dd($user)</code> does retrieve all the posts and their votes of the user.</p>  <p>The View (which displays as many times as there as posts related to the user which is not what should be happening)</p>  <pre><code>@foreach($user-&gt;posts as $post)    Link Karma: {{ $post-&gt;votes-&gt;sum('value') }} @endforeach </code></pre>
