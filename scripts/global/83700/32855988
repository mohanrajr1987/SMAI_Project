<p>Usually, with laravel out of the box I am able to access the default "User" model without prefixing namespace routes, within any view, like so:</p>  <pre><code>User::find(1); </code></pre>  <p>However, if I create another model, for example - "Business", in order to access it in views I need to do the following:</p>  <pre><code>App\Business::find(1); </code></pre>  <p>Is there any way to "use" the classes globally in all views, so it works just like User class?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>  <p>Edit: It works if I do the following in a blade.php file, for example:</p>  <pre><code>@extends('layouts.main')  @section('content')     &lt;?php         use App\Business;     ?&gt;     {{ Business::find(1)-&gt;name }} @stop </code></pre>  <p>But it seems like a not-so-clean way to do it. Or am I wrong and this is acceptable?</p>  <p>P.S - Using Laravel 5.1</p>
