<p>I am working on this prompt from the book Eloquent Javascript:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Write a program that uses console.log to print all the >numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print >"Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print >"Buzz" instead. When you have that working, modify your program to print >"FizzBuzz", for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print >"Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those). </p> </blockquote>  <p>Although my answer shows the same output as the <code>solution</code> on <code>EloquentJavaScript.net</code>, my code looks a lot different. Is this a correct answer or are there any reasons I should be aware of that would cause problems in my program.</p>  <pre><code>for (var i = 1; i &lt;= 100; i++){     if (i % 3 == 0 &amp;&amp; i % 5 == 0) console.log("FizzBuzz");     else if (i % 3 == 0) console.log("Fizz");     else if (i % 5 == 0) console.log("Buzz");     else console.log(i); } </code></pre>  <p>The author answers the prompt like this: </p>  <pre><code>The author answers the prompt like this:  for (var n = 1; n &lt;= 100; n++) {   var output = "";   if (n % 3 == 0)     output += "Fizz";   if (n % 5 == 0)     output += "Buzz";   console.log(output || n); } </code></pre>
