<p>I'm struggling to figure out how I can use this SQL with eloquent methods.</p>  <pre><code>SELECT * FROM artists WHERE artists.id NOT IN (SELECT artist_id FROM artist_issues WHERE issue = 'update_images') </code></pre>  <p>I see that the "whereNotIn" method takes a column, and then an array as the second parameter, so it's not possible to pass a subquery. </p>  <p>Any ideas how I could do this?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
