<p>I have 2 tables : <strong>tasks</strong> and <strong>executions</strong>. A <em>task</em> "hasMany" <em>executions</em> (and an <em>execution</em> "belongsTo" a <em>task</em>).</p>  <p>Fields in table <em>tasks</em>: <code>id (primary key), name, data, created_at, ...</code><br> Fields in table <em>executions</em>: <code>id (primary key), process_name, created_at, task_id.</code></p>  <p>I want to get the <strong>oldest task</strong> (based on <em>tasks.created_at</em>) which,<br> - has never been been executed (no record in table <em>executions</em> with the task id as task_id),<br>     <strong>OR</strong><br> - has been executed by any other process but "MyProcess" => executions.process_name &lt;> 'MyProcess'</p>  <p>I read the Eloquent doc and find the "Querying Relationship Existence" but I can't find how to query non-existence.</p>  <p>How can I do (I hope I was clear enough)? Thank you very much in advance, I'm stuck!</p>
