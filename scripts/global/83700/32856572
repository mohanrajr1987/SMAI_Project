<p>I'm new to Laravel and trying to do a string query in Eloquent. I was trying to use <code>DB::statement</code>, but I kept getting errors about placeholders in the query string. It seems I either don't have the syntax right, or bindings are unimplemented or unsupported? </p>  <p>The reason I want to use <code>statement</code> is because I'm doing an <code>INSERT... SELECT</code>, which I haven't been able to find any documentation about in Eloquent.</p>  <p>Here's my code:</p>  <pre><code>$ php artisan tinker Psy Shell v0.5.2 (PHP 5.6.13-0+deb8u1 â€” cli) by Justin Hileman &gt;&gt;&gt; echo \DB::statement('CREATE DATABASE :db', [':db'=&gt;'test']); Illuminate\Database\QueryException with message 'SQLSTATE[42000]: Syntax error or access violation: 1064 You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '?' at line 1 (SQL: CREATE DATABASE :db)' &gt;&gt;&gt; \DB::statement('CREATE DATABASE ?', ['test']); Illuminate\Database\QueryException with message 'SQLSTATE[42000]: Syntax error or access violation: 1064 You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '?' at line 1 (SQL: CREATE DATABASE test)' </code></pre>  <p>These are the two syntax forms (<code>?</code> and <code>:string</code>) from PDO. Other methods in <code>DB</code> such as <code>select</code> and <code>insert</code> support this, according to the <a href="http://laravel.com/docs/5.1/database#running-queries" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>.</p>  <p>The relevant parts of these errors are <code>near '?' at line 1 (SQL: CREATE DATABASE :db)</code> and <code>near '?' at line 1 (SQL: CREATE DATABASE test)</code>. MySQL thinks there is an unbound <code>?</code> in the query string. I didn't even use that syntax in the first query. I'm concluding from that that the <code>bind()</code> method did not correctly bind my placeholders.</p>  <p><a href="https://laracasts.com/discuss/channels/laravel/l5-bindings-is-not-working-with-dbstatement" rel="nofollow">This question on Laracasts</a> is asking about the syntax, but there is no accepted answer.</p>  <p><strong>Edit</strong> One answer says that <code>statement()</code> doesn't support <code>CREATE</code>. I tried some queries out with <code>SELECT</code>, and got the same results, with both placeholders:</p>  <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; \DB::statement('SELECT 1 WHERE \'a\' = ?', array('a')); Illuminate\Database\QueryException with message 'SQLSTATE[42000]: Syntax error or access violation: 1064 You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'WHERE 'a' = ?' at line 1 (SQL: SELECT 1 WHERE 'a' = a)' &gt;&gt;&gt; \DB::statement('SELECT 1 WHERE \'a\' = :letter', array(':letter'=&gt;'a')); Illuminate\Database\QueryException with message 'SQLSTATE[42000]: Syntax error or access violation: 1064 You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'WHERE 'a' = ?' at line 1 (SQL: SELECT 1 WHERE 'a' = :letter)' </code></pre>
