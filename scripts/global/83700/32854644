<p>I'm new to laravel and eloquent and I can't find an example of what I'm trying to do , lets say I have three tables A B C , and all of them have many to many relations ships <code>A - ab - B - bc - C.</code></p>  <pre><code>ab : table contains key from A and B. bc : table contains key from B and C. </code></pre>  <p>What to do if I want to find C objects using A (a_id = 1) ?</p>  <p>I tried something like this <code>A::find(1) -&gt; B() -&gt; C()-&gt;get() ;</code></p>  <pre><code>B() is method i created to get B objects in A model. C() is method i created to get C objects in B model. </code></pre>  <p>What am I doing wrong ? I hope the question and the example are clear.</p>  <p>Best regards.</p>
