<p>Sorry for the short question title, this absurdly simple thing doesn't work and I have no idea why. I'm trying to manually set the key on a model relation in Laravel (why manually? I need to compare the current key to what I'm setting it to, to see if there's been a change; as far as I know there's no other way of doing this):</p>  <pre><code>$this-&gt;mission-&gt;featured_image = $input['featured_image']; </code></pre>  <p>Where <code>$input['featured_image']</code> is 3. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/2thyv9M.png" rel="nofollow">Proof</a>.</p>  <p>A Featured Image is a relation defined as such on my <code>Mission</code> model:</p>  <pre><code>class Mission extends Eloquent {     public function featuredImage() {         return $this-&gt;belongsTo('Object', 'featured_image');     }     } </code></pre>  <h3>Schema</h3>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/a02CZ.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/a02CZ.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>After stepping through the assignment, <code>$this-&gt;mission-&gt;featured_image</code> remains null, despite that what I am assigning it isn't. Thoughts?</p>
