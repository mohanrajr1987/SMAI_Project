<p>Ok, so I have linebreaks preserved when being uploaded to my database and they are seen when displayed on a webpage, but I have an issue. My website is a forum and I don't want a user to have a topic with an excessive amount of linebreaks between text... for example:</p>  <pre><code>line 1 &lt;1 blank line&gt; &lt;2 blank lines&gt; &lt;3 blank lines&gt; &lt;4 blank lines&gt; line 2 &lt;1 blank line&gt; &lt;2 blank lines&gt; line 3 </code></pre>  <p>That is going to make my page much longer than it needs to be and will just cause an unpleasant page. Is there anyway I can make it where only 1 new line can be added between text lines, for example</p>  <pre><code>line 1 &lt;1 blank line&gt; line 2 &lt;1 blank line&gt; line 3 </code></pre>  <p>Thank you for any help in advance!</p>
