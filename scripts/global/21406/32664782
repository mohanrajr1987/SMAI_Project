<p>This is really two questions - related.</p>  <p>Using Mule enterprise 3.7.1</p>  <p>I have defined a custom security scheme in RAML, and am importing the RAML to a Mule API kit Router. Now want to read the details of the securedBy specifier on an incoming request. An example of my securedBy:</p>  <pre><code>securedBy: [OAuth_2: {scopes: [MODULE_READ]}, CUSTOM_SEC: {roles: { oneOf: [fees_user, fees_admin] } }] </code></pre>  <p>I realize i can probably parse the RAML myself, and manually search for the endpoint, however i figure Mule has already done this.</p>  <p><strong>Question 1</strong>: How can i access the parsed RAML endpoint for the current request in a Mule flow (i'm prepared to use a Java transformer); then read both the OAuth security properties and CUSOM_SEC properties.</p>  <p>Once I've done this, I'd like to apply the OAuth scopes defined in the RAML. Mule does not currently support this function, and currently we are doing this manually with <code>oauth2-provider:validate</code> components.</p>  <p><strong>Question 2</strong>: How can i (in java code) get a new instance of an <code>oauth2-provider:validate</code> component, set the scope, and tell it to do its stuff?</p>
