<p>I have scenario like if 3 errors occurs then one catch block should execute other than these three other catch block should execute.</p>  <p>I have tried by placing 3 exceptions : #[exception.causedBy(java.net.UnknownHostException) ||exception.causedBy(java.net.ConnectException)||exception.causedBy(org.mule.transport.jms.redelivery.MessageRedeliveredException)] in first catch-1 when condition and left second catch as blank. But what issue I'm facing here is control is directly entering into second catch-2. I have tried by pacing #[exception.causedBy(*)] in second catch-2. But it didn't work can anybody suggest on this?<br> Thanks.,</p>
