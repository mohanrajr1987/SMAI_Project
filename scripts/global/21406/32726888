<p>Using mule 3.7 with a RESTful application and a design which calls for using dynamic links.  The Jersey documentation and examples call telling the application about the package to use links, and registering the DeclarativeLinkingFeature class on that package, then use @InjectLink annotation on the field of the class to receive the link.</p>  <p>This is problematic with Mule, and the Application structure is internal to Mule.  Without this registration, they @InjectLink has no effect, jersey does not populate the link.</p>  <p>Does anyone have a solution or work around, or even know if Mule has any provisions for implementing Dynamic Linking.  We have been able to find no information in the Mule documentation nor examples of Mule applications utilizing this feature.  Any hints would be appreciated.</p>
