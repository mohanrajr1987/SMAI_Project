<p>I need to take data from one queue and need to place data in other queue.</p>  <p>Exception handling strategy: if destination queue is down need to place data in source queue. If destination queue is up and anything go wrong in between then need to write to other queue(to do not loose the message). To achieve this I'm using choice, rollback and catch exception strategy. </p>  <p>in rollback's when condition: #[exception.causedBy(java.net.UnknownHostException) ||exception.causedBy(java.net.ConnectException)||exception.causedBy(org.mule.transport.jms.redelivery.MessageRedeliveredException)] </p>  <p>if other than this occur go to catch : I'm leaving when condition as blank but problem is if error occurs directly console coming to catch not executing rollback. and I'm loosing the message from source.</p>  <p>Please suggest me on this.., thanks in advance..,      </p>
