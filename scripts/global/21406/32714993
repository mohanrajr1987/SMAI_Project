<p>Mule ESB CE supports object stores, which can be set to persistent. From <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26056997/how-to-share-data-between-mule-apps-dont-use-databaseusing-object-store">here</a> I know also, that the stores are application-specific if defined in the application XMLs.</p>  <p>Unfortunately, I was unable to find any information if any data will be lost when:</p>  <ol> <li>Mule is restarted</li> <li>Mule is killed</li> <li>The application is re-deployed</li> </ol>  <p>I'm almost sure that (1) has no impact on the data. I suppose that the object store is also kill-agnostic. What about application being redeployed? I think there are 2 scenarios here:</p>  <ol> <li>Object store is defined on app-level</li> <li>Object store is defined on domain-level</li> </ol>  <p>Am I right that in the 1st scenario data will be lost, while the latter will retain the data across application redeploys?</p>  <p>I'm working on Mule 3.5.0 CE.</p>  <p>Any help &amp; references will be appreciated.</p>
