<h2>My input for dataWeave:</h2>  <p><strong>Collection(i.e; List of 'Order' objects)</strong></p>  <pre><code>    1st Order Object     ----SampleObject1    (SampleObject is also a List of Objects that is getting repeated)           --- SampleValue1    (some 'String' attribute of 'Order' object)           --- SampleValue2         ---SampleObject2           --- SampleValue3    (some 'String' attribute of 'Order' object)           --- SampleValue4     .     ------SampleObject3         --- SampleValue5     .         --- SampleValue6     ------SampleObject4          --- SampleValue7           --- SampleValue8   .   .   2nd Order Object     ----SampleObject1    (SampleObject is also a List of Objects that is getting repeated)           --- SampleValue1    (some 'String' attribute of 'Order' object)           --- SampleValue2         ---SampleObject2           --- SampleValue3    (some 'String' attribute of 'Order' object)           --- SampleValue4     .     ------SampleObject3         --- SampleValue5     .         --- SampleValue6     ------SampleObject4          --- SampleValue7           --- SampleValue8   .   . </code></pre>  <p>For each 'Order' object in the collection, I need a record in a CSV.</p>  <h2>OutputCSV:</h2>  <pre><code>SampleValue1      SampleValue3    SampleValue5 .....

The problem I am facing is, <strong>I need a record in CSV for each Object.</strong> But what I am getting is a record for each 'SampleValue'. Please help me how to overcome this issue. Thanks in advance!!</p>
