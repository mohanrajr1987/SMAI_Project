<p>I am trying to get MuleContext object in my Connector code. I am trying to create a connector in Mule. Below are my questions:</p>  <ol> <li>Can I pass MuleContext object from the mule flow which is calling the Connector I have created.</li> <li>Can I get the MuleContext object inside the Connector class only. Once I place this connector in my flow it would take the correct context automatically?</li> </ol>
