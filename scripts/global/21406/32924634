<p>Is there any specific reason why output of Transform Message to flowVars or outboundProperties is converted to String but in case of payload it stays as WeaveOutputHandler ?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/1g5ID.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/1g5ID.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Screenshot from Mule Debugger with payload and flowVars.myVar generated with the same DataWeave script:</p>  <pre><code>%dw 1.0 %output application/xml --- {     request: {         id: 100     } } </code></pre>  <p>Problem with this is that you can't use flowVars.myVar.request.id in any further transformations in your flow.</p>
