<p>We are working on Mule HA cluster PoC with two separate server nodes. We were able to create a cluster. We have developed small dummy application with Http endpoint with reliability pattern implementation which loops for a period and prints a value. When we deploy the application in Mule HA cluster, even though its deploys successfully in cluster and application log file has been generated in both the servers but its running in only one server. In application we can point to only server IP for HTTP endpoint. Could any one please clarify my following queries?</p>  <ol> <li>In our case why the application is running in one server (which ever IP points to server getting executed). </li> <li>Will Mule HA cluster create virtual IP?</li> <li>If not then which IP we need to configure in application for HTTP endpoints?</li> <li>Do we need to have Load balancer for HTTP based endpoints request? If so then in application which IP needs to be configured for HTTP endpoint as we don't have virtual IP for Mule HA cluster?</li> </ol>  <p>Really appreciate any help on this.</p>  <p><strong>Environment</strong>: Mule EE ESB v 3.4.2 &amp; Private cloud.</p>
