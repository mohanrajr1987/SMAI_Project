<p>I have been asked to create a password-protected .csv file. This would be similar to password protecting in Excel or Word. </p>  <p>An option I suppose would be to create a password-protected .zip of the .csv file. On the recipient's end, they need to open the file using a standard tool like zip/7zip/Excel/etc., where they supply a password.</p>  <p>Is there a straightforward way to do this in Mule?</p>
