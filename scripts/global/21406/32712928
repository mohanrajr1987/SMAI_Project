<p>I'm trying to get a project that was made in Mule 3.4 working in Mule 3.7. In Mule 3.4, using the HTTP endpoint-based Connector it was possible to retrieve multiple cookies from response messages by using:</p>  <pre>    Object cookieObj = message.getInboundProperty("Set-Cookie");     String cookieValSchoolname = CookieHelper.getCookieValueFromCookies (cookieObj, "schoolname");     String cookieValJSessionId = CookieHelper.getCookieValueFromCookies(cookieObj, "JSESSIONID"); </pre>  <p>In Mule 3.4, using the HTTP endpoint-based Connector, the inbound property "Set-Cookie" contained an array of all the cookies that are set with Set-Cookie in the http header.</p>  <p>However when I use the same code with the new HTTP operation-based Connector, the inbound property "Set-Cookie" only contains the first cookie and not an array with all cookies.</p>  <p>Can anybody tell me how I can access all cookies using the new HTTP Connector? Maybe there is a way to retrieve the raw http header, to parse that?</p>  <p>The only other inbound properties the message has are content-length, http.reason, http.status, content-type, server and date.</p>
