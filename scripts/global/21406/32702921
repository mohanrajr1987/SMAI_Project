<p>I would like to change the log directory from <strong>MULE_HOME/logs</strong> to <strong>MULE_HOME/logs/apps</strong>.  The only place I have found that refers to a file path is in <strong>MULE_HOME/conf/wrapper.conf</strong>.  Editing the <strong>wrapper.logfile</strong> does allow me to relocate the mule_ee.log file, which seems to be the Mule application log, but I'd like to include Mule application logs there, too.  If I create an application called FOO and deploy it to the runtime environment, it will create a file called <strong>MULE_HOME/logs/mule-app-FOO.log</strong>, but changing the location seems to be difficult short of completely messing things up writing custom log4j2 XML files.</p>
