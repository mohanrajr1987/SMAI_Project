<p>When I use the old YouTube player on my phone (before updating it), it works properly. But after I update my YouTube player, my android code Youtubeplayer shows this error. It just plays, stops, and shows this error. Any ideas on what's causing it to stop?</p>  <pre><code>YouTube video playback stopped because the player's view is not visible. The view com.android.internal.policy.impl.PhoneWindow$DecorView {36d050c2 I.E..... R.....ID 0,0-540,960} has visibility "INVISIBLE". </code></pre>
