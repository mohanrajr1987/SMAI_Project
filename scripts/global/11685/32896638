<p>When trying to run this reports query, Apps Script returns a "Forbidden" error. </p>  <pre><code>var analyticsResponse = YouTubeAnalytics.Reports.query(   'channel==' + channel,   startDate,   yesterdayFormatted,   'views',   {     filters: 'group==' + groupID   }); </code></pre>  <p>The same query works just fine through the query explorer web UI.</p>  <p>I tried groups created through the API as well as through the Youtube Analytics web UI. </p>  <p>The groups are all older than 48 hours. </p>  <p>The query runs fine with any other filter in multiple scripts with different metrics, sorts, etc. </p>  <p>Youtube Data and Reporting API permissions are set for the script and for the project.</p>  <p>Any idea what I might be missing?</p>
