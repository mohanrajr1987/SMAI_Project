<p>I am using youtube data API V3 to upload the videos to the youtube.</p>  <p>I am unclear of what should be the value for the paramter "onBehalfOfContentOwner". Should it be the auth credentials of YouTube CMS user who is managing all the channels..or it should be the Actual channel owner for the youtube .</p>
