<p>I am trying to load YouTube player using IFrame api.</p>  <p><strong>DOM Structure</strong></p>  <pre><code>&lt;div id="player-wrapper"&gt;     &lt;div id="player"&gt;     &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p><strong>Jquery code to load player</strong></p>  <pre><code>$(document).ready(function () {         $('head').append($('&lt;script src="https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;')); });  window.onYouTubeIframeAPIReady = function() {     Player = new YT.Player('player', {         videoId: 'RVRlV53TjzY',         playerVars : {             theme  : 'light',             color  : 'red',             iv_load_policy : 3,             modestbranding: 1,             disablekb: 1,             showinfo: 0,             controls: 0,             autoplay: 1,             fs:0         }     }); }; </code></pre>  <p>With this structure, YouTube player loads in div with id as 'player'. Along with loading YouTube player, I want to bind mousemove event on player-wrapper. On mousemove of this container, I want to show some message to user over the YouTube player.</p>  <p>I am trying to do this with:</p>  <pre><code>$("#player-wrapper").bind('mousemove', function() {     console.log("You are viewing YouTube Video "); }); </code></pre>  <p>I see that, when YouTube player is loaded, I do not get this mousemove event on player-wrapper. I tried replacing YouTube player with normal HTML5 video tag. With this I started getting mousemove event. Also looked into z-index property of these elements, but couldn't figure out what is happening.</p>  <p>Please help.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
