<p><strong>Hi Guys!</strong> </p>  <p>The problem is that I have a form which searches etc. The thing that go's wrong is that the first time you use the form nothing happens and it go's to domain/?. I have no idea what the problem is. I've tried a lot of things but nothing seems to be doing the trick. Thanks! </p>  <p><em>It seems like it doesn't prevent the default action on the first run because I've tried and a console.log inside this function won't run.</em></p>  <pre><code>$(function () {     $('#search-bar').on('submit', function (e) {         var y = $('#search').val().toLowerCase();         if (y === 'location') {             geoSearch();         } else {         qCall(y);         }         x.val('');         e.preventDefault;     }); }); </code></pre>  <p><em>The forms HTML has not action or method</em></p>
