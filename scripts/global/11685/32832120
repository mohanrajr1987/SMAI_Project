<p>[Problem 1]</p>  <p>I am using <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/subscriptions/list" rel="nofollow">https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/subscriptions/list</a> for a large channel (1 million subscribers) but after 100 successful pages of results (50 subscribers per page), the API always returns 0 subscribers.</p>  <p>Is there a hard limit of 100 pages or 5,000 subscribers that can be returned?</p>  <p>[Problem 2]</p>  <p>Of the 5,000 Subscribers returned, only 3,577 are unique. The API seems to be returning duplicates in some cases which I know is a long standing issue with getting channel subscribers. Hoping to learn if this will be fixed?</p>
