<pre><code>function onPlayerStateChange(event) {     if(event.data == YT.PlayerState.PLAYING) {         ql = event.target.getAvailableQualityLevels();         console.log(ql);     } } </code></pre>  <p>I want to print the quality array. This <strong>works most of the times in Safari</strong> but not always and it does't work in Chrome nor Firefox. I don't understand why it works some times in Safari and why other times not and why it doesn't work in other browsers?</p>  <p>This is how I call the API</p>  <pre><code>  var player;   function onYouTubePlayerAPIReady() {     player = new YT.Player('ytplayer', {             height: height,             width: width,             videoId: yt_id,             playerVars: {             html5: 1,             wmode: "transparent",             controls: 0,             showinfo: 0,             rel: 0,             modestbranding: 1,             iv_load_policy: 3 //anottations             },             events: {                 'onError': onPlayerError,                 'onReady': onPlayerReady,                 'onStateChange': onPlayerStateChange             }         });     }; </code></pre>
