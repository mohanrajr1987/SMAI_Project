<p>Trying to upload videos using V3 API from a form. When specifying the path to the video I'm using <code>$videoPath = file_get_contents($_FILES["file"]["name"]);</code>  I've also tried it with out the <code>get_file_contents</code> and it tells me it can't find the file. I must be missing something, is there a way to upload directly from a form post without having to upload it to my server, than upload it to YouTube?</p>
