<p>I try to upload videos to my youtube account with youtube api v3 on asp.net. I searched a lot but didn't find any code sample to do this. Actually now i can upload videos somehow but i can't give name, description etc. to my videos. Here's my code which i use to upload my videos.</p>  <pre><code>        Uri uri = new Uri("https://www.googleapis.com/upload/youtube/v3/videos?part=snippet");         WebClient wc = new WebClient();          wc.Headers.Add("Authorization", "Bearer {access_token}");         byte[] file = File.ReadAllBytes(Server.MapPath("/videos/test.mp4"));         byte[] response = wc.UploadData(uri, file);          string jSonResult = String.Format("\nResult received was {0}",               Encoding.ASCII.GetString(response));         return jSonResult; </code></pre>
