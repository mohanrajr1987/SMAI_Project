<p>I am trying to integrate my web application with YouTube using API v3. We intend to upload videos to our specific YouTube channel. However, the login ID used uploads files to the default channel (provided by YouTube) instead of the default channel set in my login Id. </p>  <p><strong>Specific questions:</strong></p>  <p>1) What is a service account in this context?</p>  <p>2) Why are the videos being uploaded to YouTube default channel rather than default channel set in the account?</p>  <p>3) How can I upload videos to the user selected default channel (I am manager of this channel) via YouTube API v3?</p>  <p>We are running behind time on this integration, quick help is appreciated.</p>  <p>Look forward...</p>
