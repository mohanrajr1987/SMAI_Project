<p>This is my layout on a Windows 8.1 store app This is a one grid with 3 columns. with respective sizes 2.5*, 30px, and 1*. </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/chGJw.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/chGJw.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>My objective is to animate this layout on code behind. When user clicks on the gray color button, blue area need to slide to left until it's gone and at the same time green area need to expand with its content. gray button will stop on left edge of the screen.</p>  <p>When user hits the button again that animation needs to reverse. What I don't know is how to animate same grids columns. Please help.</p>  <p>So far I came up is this</p>  <pre><code>        Storyboard storyboard = new Storyboard();         Duration duration = new Duration(TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(500));         //CubicEase ease = new CubicEase { EasingMode = EasingMode.EaseOut };         var animation = new DoubleAnimation();         //animation.EasingFunction = ease;         animation.Duration = duration;         storyboard.Children.Add(animation);         animation.From = col1.ActualWidth;         animation.To = 0;         animation.EnableDependentAnimation = true;         Storyboard.SetTarget(animation, col1);         Storyboard.SetTargetProperty(animation, "(ColumnDefinition.MaxWidth)");         storyboard.Begin(); </code></pre>  <p>This is exactly what I want. But the problem is both blue and green area has complex XAML components so animation not running smooth.</p>
