<p>I have the problem, that i need to figure out the main color of an icon, and selected the "nearest" color from a list in c#.</p>  <p>At first i have a list with colors, for example:</p>  <ol> <li>R: 176, G: 30, B: 0</li> <li>R: 114, G: 0, B: 172</li> <li>R: 25, G: 153, B: 0</li> <li>R: 255, G: 183, B: 0</li> <li>...</li> </ol>  <p>Than i have a list of icons:</p>  <ol> <li>New Document</li> <li>Save</li> <li>Folder/Directory</li> <li>...</li> </ol>  <p>Now i want to get the main color in every icon and than get the color, which is as similar as possible to one of the predefined list.</p>  <p>My first solution was, to get the RGB value from every icon pixel and then devide through the amout of pixels, but then i only get some brown and gray colors.</p>  <p>Does any one has a solution for this problem?</p>  <p>Thank you very much!</p>
