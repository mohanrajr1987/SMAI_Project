<p>I want to develop a windows 8 metro app (C# and XAML) which support the bluetooth low energy(BLE) feature. I found a sample Windows Phone app for this.I tried to convert to Windows 8 app, but some features are not supporting in Windows 8 like <strong>Windows.Devices.Bluetooth.BluetoothLEDevice</strong> . Is there any Windows 8 application for BLE? Please help me.</p>  <p>Please see the link: Windows phone app for BLE <a href="https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsapps/Bluetooth-LE-Explorer-91669105" rel="nofollow">https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsapps/Bluetooth-LE-Explorer-91669105</a></p>
