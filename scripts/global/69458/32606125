<p>How can I distribute an app in windows 8.1 or higher as a limited extent inside a company?</p>  <p>I made the next steps but I failed:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>• I created an app and uploaded the appxupload arquives</p>      <p>• I defined the visibility Hide this app and stop selling</p>      <p>• I generated promotional codes and I distributed them</p>      <p>• I could exchanged this codes but I couldn’t downloaded them</p> </blockquote>  <p>I also changed the visibility method to: Hidden the app in the store. If customers have a direct link to the app description, they can download the app with exceptions: windows 8 and windows 8.1. But this only solve the problem in windows 10 devices.</p>  <p>Which are the correct steps to publish an app in windows store to windows 8.1 operating system in a limited extent? Or, if i can do it in the store, how can I do it?</p>  <p>Thank you</p>
