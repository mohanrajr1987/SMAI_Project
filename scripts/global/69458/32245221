<p>I'm wondering if its possible to allow the user to open a file/folder once he/she clicks on a tile? these are not storage folders or solution folders. Its simply files from a shared file server. Although I have enabled enterprise authentication but did not manage to do it. I'm trying to find a way but didnt get any luck. </p>  <p>Any suggestions, code snippets or tutorials would be very much appreciated.</p>
