<p>I'm new to Windows 10 and I absolutely love the Modern/Metro design. I'd love to create programs for Microsoft appstore that look like the Windows Mail or Office 365 Powerpoint but I don't know if I'm on the right track:</p>  <ol> <li><p>I downloaded and installed Microsoft Visual Studio Code, but it seems more for web development. Should I use Cordova and web technologies to create such apps? It is using WinJS(?) but I'm wondering if XAML is a better option?</p></li> <li><p>I've also <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/dn609832.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" rel="nofollow">installed Visual Studio 2015</a> and put my Windows 10 in developer mode, but there is a bunch of options under C# projects: universal apps, windows forms apps, etc. Which one should I choose to do a native Windows app that looks like Microsoft Mail?</p></li> </ol>  <p>In general there is a whole bunch of options available and that is confusing. I know Java so picking up C# isn't hard for me. Also I've worked with Javascript/HTML/CSS for 4 years now and that is also comfortable for me.</p>  <p>I prefer performance and ease of maintenance.</p>
