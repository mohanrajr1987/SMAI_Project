<p>I have as single <code>BackGroundTask</code>. Can we start this <code>BackgroundTask</code> using both <code>PushNotification</code> or using "Geofencing" technique in a same app? My requirement is that, <code>BackgroundTask</code> should start in either any of the following two cases:</p>  <ol> <li>When push notification is received, which I already implemented on my app and it is working well.</li> <li>When user change its location, using "Geofencing" technique which I need to implement on my app.</li> </ol>  <p>Any help would be appreciated. Thanks is advance!</p>
