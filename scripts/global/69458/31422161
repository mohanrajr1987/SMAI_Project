<p>How do I open a webpage by a tile click event in windows 8 grid app? I have tried modifying this event handler but I get an error as it expects a text value.</p>  <p>I have used the following code but it only works if i enter the value manually but  i want it to get the value from the data source. </p>  <pre><code>   void ItemView_ItemClick(object sender, ItemClickEventArgs e)     {         // Navigate to the appropriate destination page, configuring the new page         // by passing required information as a navigation parameter       var itemId = ((SampleDataItem)e.ClickedItem).URL;     //  this.Frame.Navigate(typeof(ItemDetailPage), itemId);        Launcher.LaunchUriAsync(new Uri(itemId));      } </code></pre>  <p>UPDATE: so i figured out why it doesnt work, i was pointing to an intranet page link, anyone knows how to fix it?</p>
