<p>I added a phone version of my app to my solution, and recently added it to the store.  The Windows 8.1 version was also updated.  In the store, the phone version shows as a universal app, but the original does not.  Does anyone know if I did something wrong?  Developing on 8.1, using VS 2013.</p>
