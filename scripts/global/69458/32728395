<p>So im making a windows store app that you select a file with one button, via file picker, then with another button it processes that file but im having trouble getting the selected file to processing method.<br> Since the Picker sets one of my text blocks to the path of the file to be displayed for the user i've tried using:<br> <code>StorageFile file = await StorageFile.GetFileFromPathAsync(fullFilePath.Text);</code><br> But due to Windows RT limitations I just get access it denied from most locations<br> Any other suggestions on what to try?</p>  <p>First button click:</p>  <pre><code>private async Task getFile()         {             FileOpenPicker openPicker = new FileOpenPicker();             openPicker.ViewMode = PickerViewMode.List;             openPicker.SuggestedStartLocation = PickerLocationId.DocumentsLibrary;             openPicker.FileTypeFilter.Add(".txt");              StorageFile file = await openPicker.PickSingleFileAsync();             if (file != null)             {                 fullFilePath.Text = file.Path;             }             else             {                 updateStatus("File Selection cancelled.");             }         } </code></pre>  <p>Second button start this but needs to use the file from above</p>  <pre><code>private async Task processFile() {     ...     string content = await FileIO.ReadTextAsync(file);     ... } </code></pre>
