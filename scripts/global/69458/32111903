<p>I have a CreateSchedule() function which execute when I open app.</p>  <pre><code> private async static Task&lt;int&gt; CreateSchedule()     {         try         {             DateTime now = DateTime.Now;             DateTime planTill = now.AddMinutes(15);             do             {                 await DoSomeWork();                 now = DateTime.Now;                 await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5));             } while (now &lt; planTill);              return 1;         }         catch (Exception ex)         {             Debug.WriteLine(ex);             return 0;         }     } </code></pre>  <p>This function runs continuously (I have used do-while loop) when the app is in active state or in foreground state. But when I minimize or press Back or Start button on WP, this function won't execute anymore. </p>  <p>So is there any ways to execute that function continuously even when the app is minimized or Start or Back button is pressed.</p>  <p>I have tried using BackgroundTask but that seems to execute only between 0-15 minutes from the time of registration which is not my requirement.</p>  <p>Please suggest some if there are any Threads we can run in background in Windows Phone.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
