<p>I am writing some code to debug apps which requires enabling debugging for apps and then suspending/resuming them. </p>  <p>I have started encountering some problems on Windows 10. some of the apps e.g. Microsoft Xbox Identity provider are not getting suspended or resume.</p>  <p>I have tried this both via IPackageDebugSettings interfaces as well using PLMDebug tool. The tool is also not able to suspend/resume some apps while the enableDebug and disableDebug works fine on them.</p>  <p>Most of the other apps are having no issues when suspending/resuming via PLMDebug tool.</p>  <p>please help.</p>
