<p>So I'm fairly new to programming and decided to try some networking but I'm stuck.  I tried to create a simple client and server just to establish a connection.  Obviously, it doesnt work, and I've looked around but can't find any <strong>new</strong> information to help me.  So I decided to try here.</p>  <p>Here is what's happening when I run the client and server:</p>  <p>(I'm running the client and server on the same computer)</p>  <p>*Client connects to server (localhost): </p>  <p>-System.Exception: A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not properly respond after a period of time, or established connection failed because connected host has failed to respond.</p>  <p>*Client connects to server when server is not running: </p>  <p>-System.Exception: No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it.</p>  <p>*Client connects to localhost at port 80 (which is not the server):</p>  <p>-Connection established</p>  <p>*Client connect to HostName google.com at port 80:</p>  <p>-Connection established</p>  <p>*Client connects to random ip and port:</p>  <p>-System.Exception: No such host is known.</p>  <p>Servercode:</p>  <pre><code>public sealed partial class MainPage : Page {     StreamSocketListener _listener = new StreamSocketListener();     string port = "1800";      public MainPage()     {         this.InitializeComponent();         listener();     }     private async void listener()     {         _listener.ConnectionReceived += listenerConnectionReceived;         await _listener.BindServiceNameAsync(port);     }     void listenerConnectionReceived(StreamSocketListener sender, StreamSocketListenerConnectionReceivedEventArgs args)     {         tb_server.Text = "Connection received.";     }     private void btn1_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)     {      } } </code></pre>  <p>Clientcode:</p>  <pre><code>public sealed partial class MainPage : Page {     StreamSocketListener _listener = new StreamSocketListener();     string port = "1800";      public MainPage()     {         this.InitializeComponent();         listener();     }     private async void listener()     {         _listener.ConnectionReceived += listenerConnectionReceived;         await _listener.BindServiceNameAsync(port);     }     void listenerConnectionReceived(StreamSocketListener sender, StreamSocketListenerConnectionReceivedEventArgs args)     {         tb_server.Text = "Connection received.";     }     private void btn1_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)     {      } } </code></pre>
