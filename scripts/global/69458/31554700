<p>I have a <code>UserControl</code> which needs two <code>RotateTransform</code>'s, one to rotate around it's top-left corner (i.e. <code>(0,0)</code>) and another to rotate around it's center.</p>  <p>Up until now I only needed it to rotate around the center, and this was easily done by setting the control's <code>RenderTransformOrigin</code> to (<code>0.5,0.5</code>).</p>  <p>How can I set a different origin for each rotate transform ? </p>  <hr>  <p>Note that I'm also using other transformations (around the center) so I need them all to work together, so I could use a <code>TransformGroup</code> to rotate/scale/translate around the center,but I need a separate <code>RotateTransform</code> that rotates around the top-left corner only - How would I do that ?</p>
