<p>Anyone else using Visual Studio 2015 to develop Metro applications?  I just upgrade this week - fresh install of VS2015 and Windows 10.  When I try to create a project that targets Windows 8.1 I get a message that says the feature isn't installed.  When I click on the 'Install' button to install the 'Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.0 / 8.1 Tools', then VS attempts to launch another instance and I get a 'usage' message about some command line that apparently didn't launch correctly.</p>
