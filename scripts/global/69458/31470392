<p>I'm having a small problem with the windows store. I have uploaded all the required graphics in the submission, and the app has all of the required graphics (including box and wide tile images).</p>  <p>In the store however, the app entry is using a wide image. The problem is that the wide image it's using is actually a box image , that's stretched.</p>  <p>Any ideas what's going wrong?</p>
