<p>I want to develop a music app for Windows 10 and I'm not sure if this is a Windows 10 specific feature as I've tried Googling to get more information about it but I haven't had any success whatsoever. When I'm playing music in Groove Music (the new default music player in the latest version of Windows 10 tech preview) and I raise or lower the volume, the name as well as the artist and album artwork of the current song show up with music controls next to the volume indicator this:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/VRahz.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>I was wondering how I could interact with this "dialog" in C# (or if it's even possible seeing as I've done a crap ton of poking around and haven't even seen any sites mention this feature)</p>  <p>Thanks for any help.</p>  <p>(Sorry if this is off topic; I have no idea where this type of question belongs (SO, Programmers, etc...))</p>
