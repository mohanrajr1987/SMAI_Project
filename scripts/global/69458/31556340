<p>When applying a transform on a control in Windows Store apps, to set the origin of the transform, I see from the documentation that you can either set <code>RenderTransformOrigin</code> on the control or set <code>CenterX</code> and <code>CenterY</code> on the transform itself.</p>  <p>What is the difference between the two ? When both of these are set, which of them takes precedence ?</p>
