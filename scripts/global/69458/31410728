<p>I was thinking about my upcoming school project focused on Windows 10 universal apps and I ran into very interesting experiment :  <a href="https://www.chromeexperiments.com/experiment/stochasticity" rel="nofollow">https://www.chromeexperiments.com/experiment/stochasticity</a></p>  <p>I want to work on something very similiar or achieve similar level of animation in metro universal application writen in Csharp. I have never worked with any sort of animation or 2d graphics while writing WUA. </p>  <p>Can somebody direct me into right way to start with this ? What are your recommendation, is this even possible..any particular sample codes  ?</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
