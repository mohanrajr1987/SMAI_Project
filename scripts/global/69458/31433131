<p>I have two question regarding deploy and create setups to kinect v2 project.</p>  <p><strong>The first one:</strong></p>  <p>I just build my wpf project using the Kinect v2 SDK (and device).</p>  <p>how do create a setup for my application that users doesn't need to install the kinect SDK. I want that my program could be able to install in any pc that can connect the kinect v2 (pc that have the right specification), but I don't want that the user will have to install the SDK itself.</p>  <p>Is there anyone who know how to create this kind of installation? probably using somehow the dll's and libraries of the kinect v2 sdk.</p>  <p><strong>Second question:</strong>  It will be easier to develop and Metro-app instead? I'm looking for the best way to develop a kinect v2 app and creating setup for it, without the user having to install the SDK.</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
