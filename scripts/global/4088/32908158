<p>My professor assigned this task for the next week. You have to create variables and within one expression make an algorithm that gives 1 (true) when the given x, y, z are calculated and in each other state of x, y, z the result is 0. Using only bitwise operators(|, &amp;).</p>  <pre><code>x = 1 y = 0 z = 0 result 1  x = 0 y = 1 z = 0 result 1  x = 0 y = 1 z = 1 result 1  </code></pre>  <p>Everything else should be 0 (false)! We should not use any functions, loops, switches or anything else. Just 1 line of expression. He said we should use 9 variables and 8 operations so my guess is that the algorithm should look like this:</p>  <pre><code>(xOyOz) O (xOyOz) O (xOyOz) </code></pre>  <p>This gives 9 variables <code>3*x</code>, <code>3*y</code>, <code>3*z</code> and 8 operations <code>8*O</code> (one of the following should be in this place |, &amp;)</p>
