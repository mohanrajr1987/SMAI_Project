<p>I'm in the development of file encoding and decoding programs . suppose if I perform encoding multiple times continuously on a file , some part of the program is being lost . It would be because while encoding bits overflow and their pattern could be equal to end of file bit .. </p>  <p>int getc(FILE *);   </p>  <p>is returning -1 of int == EOF symbolic constant .  I tired to push all possible values to   putc( int , FILE*) ;</p>  <p>for storing EOF bit but im not able to get it .. help me</p>
