<p>Assuming i have a bitwise value of 66, that is composed by 2 and 64. Is there a way to scompose this bitwise in javascript so that the result would be an array of integers [2,64] ?</p>  <pre><code>//Example  function transformBW(x) {   //where x = 82;     ---------     var result = [2,16,64];  //desired result     return result; };  // transformBW(66) = [2,64]; </code></pre>  <p>Any help is welcomed.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
