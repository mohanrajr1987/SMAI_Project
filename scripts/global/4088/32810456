<p>Given three char inputs a,b,c, how can I turn these three 8-bit values into one 24 bit value. And next, how can I turn that 24 bit value into four separate 6-bit values.</p>  <p>For example:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>a = ascii 'A' = 0x41 = 0100 0001</p>      <p>b = ascii 'B' = 0x42 = 0100 0010</p>      <p>c = ascii 'C' = 0x43 = 0100 0011</p>      <p>allTogether = 010000010100001001000011</p>      <p>sixBit1 = 010000</p>      <p>sixBit2 = 010100</p>      <p>sixBit3 = 001001</p>      <p>sixBit4 = 000011</p> </blockquote>  <p>Now for the implementation, I was thinking of making allTogether an int because it can hold 32 bits, and then shifting the chars holding 'A', 'B' and 'C' left onto the int, but I'm not sure how much to shift left by. As for getting the four six-bit values, I don't know how to do that and I don't know what data type I should use. Any help is appreciated!</p>
