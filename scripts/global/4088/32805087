<p>I see that when I subtract positive and negative number using <code>two's complement</code> I get overflows. For example, if I subtract 1 from 2 I get:</p>  <pre><code>2 = 0010 1 = 0001 -&gt; -1 = 1111 2 + (-1) -&gt; 0010 + 1111 = 10001 </code></pre>  <p>So here the result has fifth left bit <code>10001</code> - is it overflow? I've found these rules for detected overflows with two's complement:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>If the sum of two positive numbers yields a negative result, the sum   has overflowed. If the sum of two negative numbers yields a positive   result, the sum has overflowed. Otherwise, the sum has not overflowed.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Can anyone please elaborate on these and show example?</p>
