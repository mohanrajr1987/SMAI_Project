<p>Performance and optimisation debates aside.</p>  <p>I'm looking for a way in Javascript to take a number let it be 5 and using bitwise operations change it to -5.</p>  <p>The problem with flipping the bits is that 0 becomes 1 ergo ~5 becomes -6.</p>  <p>Is there a way to do this purely through bitwise ops? I feel that adding the 1 back on would negate the minor improvement that I may or may not gain.</p>
