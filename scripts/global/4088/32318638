<p>I want to make a 16 bit value from 3 little endian bytes with a max value of 31 (this means they're maximum of 5 set bits). How would I get the last 5 bits of the bytes, then put them all together?</p>  <p>e.g. bytes : 0011111 0010101 0011100 into 1111110101111000</p>  <p>I tried this but I think I'm just overwriting my old bits</p>  <pre><code>cp = (bar &lt;&lt; 3) | (bag &gt;&gt; 2) | (bab &gt;&gt; 7); </code></pre>
