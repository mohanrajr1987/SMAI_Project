<p>I have a 8 bit value that I want to store in an existing 32 bit value, while only updating the data on 8 bits and keeping the other 24 bits as they were before. </p>  <p>For example I might want to store 0x01 (0x00000001) into the existing value 0x01000100 and I want the result to be 0x01000101.</p>  <p>My first thought was to OR in 0xFFFFFF00 to the 8 bit value I want to store to make it 0xFFFFFFXX. Then I was gonna AND that to the 32 bit value, but I realized that it won't work if the 32 bit value has 00 as the last byte and I want to store 01. Then I thought I would just use my original 8 bit value and OR it directly into the 32 bit value, but that won't work if the last byte in the 32 bit value is 01 and I want to store 00.</p>  <p>I realize that this might be a bit hard to read but basically what I want to do is to merge a 32 bit value of 0xXXXXXXXX and a 8 bit value of 0xYY (0x000000YY) to become 0xXXXXXXYY</p>
