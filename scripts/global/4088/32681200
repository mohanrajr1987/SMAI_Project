<p>I searched multiple times but I'm not sure why my contact filtering is not working. I used libgdx to create this simple game. The code is as follows:</p>  <pre><code>public static final short BORDER_CATEGORY_BITS = 0x0001; public static final short PLAYER_CATEGORY_BITS = 0x0002; public static final short ENEMY_CATEGORY_BITS = 0x0003; public static final short FOOD_CATEGORY_BITS = 0x0004;  public static final short BORDER_MASK_BITS = PLAYER_CATEGORY_BITS; public static final short PLAYER_MASK_BITS = BORDER_CATEGORY_BITS | ENEMY_CATEGORY_BITS; public static final short ENEMY_MASK_BITS = PLAYER_CATEGORY_BITS; public static final short FOOD_MASK_BITS = PLAYER_CATEGORY_BITS; </code></pre>  <p>I want player to hit the border and enemies, enemies hitting only player and nothing else, but I have a game loop that adds an enemy every 3 secs, and they go at different speeds and are hitting each other. I haven't really worked with the food so you can ignore that. </p>
