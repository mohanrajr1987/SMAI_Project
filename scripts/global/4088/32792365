<p>I have a <code>uint64_t</code> and I would like to find the index of the first set bit, reset it to zero and find the next set bit. </p>  <p>How do I know when to terminate? BSF on all zeros is undefined...</p>  <pre><code>const uint64_t input = source;  if(0 != input){      int32_t setIndex = GCC_BSF_INTRINSIC(input);      while(setIndex != UNDEFINED???){          //Do my logic          //Reset         input[setIndex] = 0;          setIndex = BSF_Variant(input);     } } </code></pre>  <p>Could somebody please help? </p>
