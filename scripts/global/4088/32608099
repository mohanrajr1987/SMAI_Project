<p>I'm reading a book that states:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>To select all the even bits in a 32 bit unsigned int, we can AND the   number with the bitmask 0xAAAAAAAAAA, which is a 32 bit number with   even bits set (0xA is a decimal 10, 1010 binary). For selecting odd   bits we can AND with bitmask 0x5555555555, which is a number with all   even bits set (0x5 is decimal 5, 0101 in binary)</p> </blockquote>  <p>What I don't get is how 0x or 1010 sets all even bits to 1. If you go from right to left starting from zero clearly it is the odd bits that are set. What am I missing?</p>
