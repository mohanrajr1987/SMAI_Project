<p>For Java how is:</p>  <p><code>long c = ((long)a &lt;&lt; 32) | ((long)b &amp; 0xFFFFFFFL);</code> </p>  <p>equivalent to </p>  <pre><code>long c = (long)a &lt;&lt; 32 c+=b </code></pre>  <p>The bit mask as I understand it will give back the original number itself and the OR and the addition operation are not equivalent. How then do these two implementations always give the same answer?</p>
