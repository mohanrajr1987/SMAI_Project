<p>I have a lot of pieces of code like</p>  <pre><code>    case 'add':     {            $succeeded = $wpdb-&gt;insert('coms',                                     array('name'=&gt;$name,'story'=&gt;$story,'imgurl'=&gt;$imgurl)                                    ) === 1;         break;     } </code></pre>  <p>and I just realized that I need to change them all to compare against both 1 and 0. They would all be like </p>  <pre><code>        $numRowsAffected = $wpdb-&gt;insert('coms',                                     array('name'=&gt;$name,'story'=&gt;$story,'imgurl'=&gt;$imgurl)                                    );         $succeeded = $numRowsAffected === 1 || $numRowsAffected === 0; </code></pre>  <p><strong>HOWEVER</strong>, I'm wondering whether there is a more compact, elegant and efficient way of checking a value against 1 or 0. Can I do it in one fell swoop with bitshift operators?</p>
