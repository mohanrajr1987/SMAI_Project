<p>I am using Bit Scan Forward to detect set bits within a unit64_t, use each set bit index within my program, clear the set bit and then proceed to find the next set bit. However, when the initial uint64_t value is:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>0000000000001000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000</p> </blockquote>  <p>The below code isn't resetting the 52nd bit, therefore it gets stuck in the while loop:</p>  <pre><code>uint64_t bits64 = data;  //Detects index being 52 int32_t index = __builtin_ffsll(bits64);  while(0 != index){      //My logic      //Set bit isn't being cleared here     clearNthBitOf64(bits64, index);      //Still picks-up bit 52 as being set     index = __builtin_ffsll(bits64); }  void clearNthBitOf64(uint64_t&amp; input, const uint32_t n) {     input &amp;= ~(1 &lt;&lt; n); } </code></pre>
