<p>I have a number, for example <code>128</code>. Its bit representation is <code>10000000</code>. I want to set the 3rd bit from the left to have <code>10100000</code> (<code>160</code>).</p>  <p>I thought that I could do this with:</p>  <pre><code>var foo = 128; foo = foo | 1 &lt;&lt; 2; </code></pre>  <p>But this gives me <code>132</code> or <code>10000100</code>. It set the 3rd <em>from the right</em>! How to set it from the left <strong>to 0 or to 1</strong>?</p>
