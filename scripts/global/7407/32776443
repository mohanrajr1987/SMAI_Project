<p>I am trying to format my URL from <code>http://jacqueskoekemoer.co.za/article/5</code> to <code>http://jacqueskoekemoer.co.za/article?i=5</code> where <code>i</code> would be the article ID in the database.</p>  <p>Currently <a href="http://jacqueskoekemoer.co.za/article?i=5" rel="nofollow">this URL</a> works. But <a href="http://jacqueskoekemoer.co.za/article/5" rel="nofollow">this one</a> does not. It does change the url to <code>article.php</code> but it doesn't add the query string to the end.</p>  <p>I know this because it does not appear in <code>print_r($_REQUEST);</code> or <code>print_r($_GET);</code></p>  <p>What am I doing wrong in my <code>.htaccess</code> file, or can you suggest other resources that I could look at to resolve the problem?</p>  <p>I have used the following 2 URL's primarily to get the RewriteRule working.</p>  <p><a href="https://www.addedbytes.com/articles/for-beginners/url-rewriting-for-beginners/" rel="nofollow">URL 1</a></p>  <p><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/11/introduction-to-url-rewriting/" rel="nofollow">URL 2</a></p>  <p>In <code>.htaccess</code> file the rule rewrite section looks like this:     RewriteEngine on</p>  <pre><code>RewriteRule ^article/$ article.php?i=$1 [L] # Handle requests for "article" #RewriteRule ^article/$/ article.php?i=$1 [NC,L] # Handle requests for "article"  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME}\.php -f RewriteRule ^(.*)$ $1.php </code></pre>
