<p>My problem sounds very simple, however I canâ€™t figure it out and after I looked everywhere as much as could, I didn't find anything.</p>  <p>I have multiple pages that have the following name format:</p>  <pre><code>www.mydomain.com/cat1/name-prefix-***hello-world***-name-suffix.html </code></pre>  <p>I need to create a rule that would output the following name format:</p>  <pre><code>www.mydomain.com/cat1/name-prefix-***new-static-string***-name-suffix.html </code></pre>  <p>I guess, since I have multiple pages I have to use regular expression that would match the substring <strong><em><code>hello-world</code></em></strong> and replace it with <strong><em><code>new-static-string</code></em></strong> but I am not sure if this can be achieved with <code>mod_rewrite</code> or if I should take a different approach.</p>  <p>Also my pages are not exclusively in the directory <code>/cat1</code>. They can be in <code>/cat2</code>, <code>/cat3</code> or <code>/whatever_cat</code> and also they can be in the root or at a fifth level sub-directory.</p>  <p>In other words the rule will have to target the file name only regardless the file path.</p>
