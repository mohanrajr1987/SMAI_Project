<p>I setup a redirect rule in my .htaccess to redirect my IP address to my domain.</p>  <p>On entering the ip address with a https:// it works perfectly. But on entering the ip address with a http:// it doesn't work.</p>  <pre><code>RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^104\.238\.126\.199$ RewriteRule (.*) https://myfuelpump.com/$1 [R=301,L] </code></pre>  <p>What could i be doing wrong ?</p>
