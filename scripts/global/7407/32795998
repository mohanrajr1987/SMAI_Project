<p>What would be useful solutions for hiding true database object ID in URL for security purposes? I found that one of the solutions would be:</p>  <p>1) Using <a href="http://hashids.org/" rel="nofollow">hashids open source project</a></p>  <p>2) Using something like same old md5 on creation of the object to generate hash and store it in database, then use it in url's and querying by them, but the drawback is that querying by auto-incremented primary keys (IDs) is faster than hashes. So I believe the possibility to hash/unhash would be better?</p>  <p>Also as I'm on Symfony, are there maybe bundles that I could not find or built in functionalities that would help?</p>  <p>Please tell me what you found useful based on your experiences.</p>
