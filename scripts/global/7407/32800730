<p>I want to hide url address extensions for my website but I dont know how to do it.I know it can be done with <code>.htacces</code> The host company that I use doesn't have <code>.htacces</code> file because I have a windows server not linux, at least that is what they told me .</p>  <p>How can i hide url extensions without <code>.htacces</code> ?  I use both <code>.php</code> and <code>.html</code> files in my website.</p>
