<p>I'm currently having trouble trying to shorten my static URLs with .htaccess.</p>  <p>So far I have:</p>  <pre><code>RewriteEngine On RewriteRule ^([a-z]+)/([a-z]+)$ content.php?category=$1&amp;topic=$2 [NC,L] </code></pre>  <p>which is successfully rewritting<br> <code>www.mywebsite.com/fish/goldfish</code>  to<br> <code>www.mywebsite.com/content.php?category=fish&amp;topic=goldfish</code></p>  <p>but how do I go one step further and omit the first parameter <code>fish</code> like so:<br> <code>www.mywebsite.com/goldfish</code></p>  <p>I've tried many code snippets but .htaccess is very hard to understand for me.</p>
