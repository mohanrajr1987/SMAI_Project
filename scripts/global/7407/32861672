<p>Some of the generated links I have are missing a path element:</p>  <pre><code>/channels/all//top_rated/yesterday/1&amp;timing=time </code></pre>  <p>while the correct path should be</p>  <pre><code>/channels/all/All/top_rated/yesterday/1&amp;timing=time </code></pre>  <p>How can I insert the "<strong>All</strong>" part in the URL but only when it is missing?</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
