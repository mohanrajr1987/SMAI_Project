<p>Suppose, a user (of a website), types a random, not-existing sub-domain name:</p>  <pre><code>random.example.com </code></pre>  <p>Is it possible to redirct them to the [main] domain:</p>  <pre><code>example.com </code></pre>  <p>The issue is that, if users type [or misspell] a sub-domain name - then currently, it goes to a [404] error page. Yet, I have already placed:</p>  <pre><code>ErrorDocument 404 http://example.com </code></pre>  <p>In the .htaccess - but, it does not redirect. Is it possible to create some kind of rewrite conditions/rules for a wildcard, such as all sub-domains that do not exist?</p>
