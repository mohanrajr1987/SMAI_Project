<p>Using ARR URL rewrite module to rewrite url between two different modules.</p>  <p>After the whole setup url is rewriting in localhost. But when i try same thing from external machines, instead of rewriting it was loading actual page. Ex: test.html</p>  <p>My Rule: if pattern matches test.html-> rewrite to www.newApp.com</p>  <p>Testing from local machine works fine, testing from external machine loads test.html page</p>
