<p>I've got something to ask you. I'm writing my rewrite rules for the first time these days, and I'm having some trouble. Now, this is my .htaccess:</p>  <pre><code>Options +FollowSymLinks -MultiViews  RewriteEngine On RewriteRule ^\/?$ public\/index.php  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteRule ^search/(.*)$ public\/search\.php\?keyword\=$1 [L]  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteRule ^authors/(.*)$ public\/author\.php\?author\=$1 [L]  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteRule ^(.*)$ public\/$1\.php [L] </code></pre>  <p>I need to know:</p>  <ol> <li>If I am doing this right (well, it's working but I don't know if there is any way to optimize this);</li> <li>How would I do to add a redirect for urls like <code>website.com/authorName/poemTitle</code> to <code>website.com/poem.php?author=authorName&amp;title=poemTitle</code>? I guess I should do something with the rewrite conditions, but I can't really find a solution. </li> </ol>  <p>Another thing: could I look if it contains both authorName and poemTitle? I could redirect every page containing those 2 parameters.</p>
