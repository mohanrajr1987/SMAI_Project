<p>I have IIS 8 with URL redirect and am having issues setting it up. What I need it to do:</p>  <p>client.domain.com\app1 <strong>rewrite</strong> www.domain.com\folder\folder\{app1}\{client}</p>  <p>client.domain.com\app2 <strong>rewrite</strong> www.domain.com\folder\{app1}\{client}</p>  <p>I would like to have "client" and "app" read in from the first url and be placed as so in the next url. </p>  <p>currently the clients load up the app with: www.domain.com\folder\folder\folder\app1\client</p>  <p>we want them to have a shorter url to type.</p>  <p>I have the very basics, I am able to do a redirect using rewrite. but it does not work the way wanted.</p>  <p>Please help</p>
