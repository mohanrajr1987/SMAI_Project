<p>I want to redirect mysite.com/blog/ to mysite.com/blogs/. However this redirect should not apply to other pages inside blog directory. For example, mysite.com/blog/article-1 should not redirect to mysite.com/blogs/article-1</p>  <p>First I tried simple 301 redirect but unfortunately it was redirecting all the content. Then I tried the following code but it didn't work out.</p>  <pre><code>RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/blog/$ Rewriterule ^(.*)$ http://www.easydestination.net/blogs/ [L,R=301] </code></pre>  <p>Any idea how to do it with htaccess?</p>
