<p>I have a static site. I want to rewrite any url without extension to the url with .html extension. </p>  <p>For example:</p>  <p>If the link is "example.com/test1", let the server find "example.com/test1.html" but in the address bar keep the "example.com/test1" showing there. </p>  <p>I will need this rewrite rule applys to any URL without (.* or /) at the end.</p>  <p>I am a beginner for Apache. Any help will be highly appreciated. </p>
