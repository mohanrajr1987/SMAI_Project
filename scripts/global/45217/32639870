<p>I'm using fullcalendar with <code>lang: 'ru'</code> option and in a view title I can see a month name in russian like '14 - 20 сентябр<strong>ь</strong> 2015'.</p>  <p>But according to russian grammar it should be '14 - 20 сентябр<strong>я</strong> 2015' - accusative month name form.</p>  <p>I see fullcalendar lang-all.js file has accusative month name forms for russian locale. Is there any way to show them in view title(for me it's related to week and day views)?</p>
