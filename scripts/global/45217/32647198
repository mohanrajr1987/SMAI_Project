<p>I'am using fullcalendar js with websocket and I can't update an event on the calendar after sending it.</p>  <p>Here is my code to send the event :</p>  <pre><code>eventDrop: function(event, delta, revertFunc){          var tosend = {             type:"update",             event:event,         };          socket.send(JSON.stringify(tosend));  }, </code></pre>  <p>Here is my code to update the event :</p>  <pre><code>if(response.type == "update"){         var uEvent = response.event;         jQuery('#calendar').fullCalendar('updateEvent', uEvent); } </code></pre>  <p>This almost works, but the event is not updating to the right date.</p>  <p><code>console.log()</code> of the received event show the right date, but  <code>jQuery('#calendar').fullCalendar('updateEvent', uEvent)</code> always sub 2 hours to the original event and pass over the new date in uEvent.</p>  <p>I try to delete and add (with renderEvent) but the event is never rendering and doesn't apear in <code>clientEvents</code> method. <code>RerenderEvents</code> not working to. Only <code>refetchEvent</code> works, but refresh all the calendar and that's not want I want to do.</p>  <p>Hope someone can help me !</p>
