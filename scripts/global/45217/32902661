<p>I am want to use jquery full calenndar v2 (<a href="http://fullcalendar.io" rel="nofollow">http://fullcalendar.io</a>) to build month navigator i.e. to show events for current month only. If user navigates to previous month, show events of previous month.</p>  <p>The problem here is <strong>start</strong> and <strong>end</strong> parameters being sent with events ajax call by full calendar is not  actually <strong>start of month</strong> and <strong>end of month</strong>. </p>  <p>By checking the source code I can get the correct parameters <strong>intervalStart</strong> and <strong>intervalEnd</strong>.</p>  <p>How I can copy <strong>intervalStart</strong> to <strong>start</strong>, so that I will get the correct parameters at server side.</p>  <p>I have checked other questions also but I did not get satisfactory results. Also I have checked the source, but I did not find any configuration options to do this.</p>  <p>Please suggest any possible solution using full calendar.</p>
