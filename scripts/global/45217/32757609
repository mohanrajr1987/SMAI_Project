<p>I'm having an issue with my SQL query that is being used to fetch events for fullcalendar, everything works fine unless an event starts before the current view starts, and ends after the current view ends, for example if I have an event that starts on a Monday and goes until Wednesday, in the day view for Tuesday it does not show up. This is because I'm not sure how to make an SQL query to get events that fit this criteria. My Current query is below:</p>  <pre><code>$query = $conn-&gt;prepare('SELECT * FROM calendar WHERE start BETWEEN :start1 AND :end1 OR end BETWEEN :start AND :end ORDER BY start ASC'); $query-&gt;bindValue(':start1', $_POST['start']); $query-&gt;bindValue(':end1', $_POST['end']); $query-&gt;bindValue(':start', $_POST['start']); $query-&gt;bindValue(':end', $_POST['end']); $query-&gt;execute(); </code></pre>  <p>Is it possible to form an SQL query to get all events where the event's duration makes it be occurring during the view, but not starting or ending during the view?</p>
