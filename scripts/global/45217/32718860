<p>I am using <code>fullcalendar</code> with resource view. I am using this mainly on <code>tablet</code>. I enabled <code>drag&amp;drop</code> events on tablet by using <code>element.addTouch();</code>. But there is one problem. I cannot scroll calendar when <code>element.addTouch()</code> exists. Events are dragged when I try scroll.  Is there possibility to enable dragging events after some delay i.e. after pressing event for 3 seconds? that would allow to scroll calendar, I think.</p>
