<p>I have a fullcalendar, and I'm able to enter event's in it. But, when I enter events, without a time, they appear to end one day earlier, so when I have the end-date of 2015-09-05, it ends on the 4th. of September, not on the 5th... I think it's because it's "the end", so on that day, it's over, so it ends one day before, but I don't want that behaviour, I want to have it shown, like the day you provide for the end is still in the time the event "runs". The interesting thing is, that if I provide a time (like 2015-09-05T14:00:00), it works, because it definetely ends on the provided day. </p>  <p>The question now is: How can I change this behaviour, so the event is displayed with the right time?</p>  <p><strong>edit:</strong> the problem is really, that the day you provide, is exclusive, so it's not in the time any more. </p>  <blockquote>   <p>end    :The exclusive date/time an event ends. Optional.</p> </blockquote>  <p>The question is, how can I change this behaviour...</p>  <p><strong>edit2</strong> I tried something like </p>  <pre><code>var end_split = enddate.split('-'); end_split[2]= parseInt(end_split[2])+parseInt("1"); enddate = end_split[0] + "-" + end_split[1] + "-" + end_split[2]; </code></pre>  <p>this now, and it works in general, but has issues, if enddate is the 30th of a month, because then the end date saved will be the 31th, and this doesn't exist always...., so this solution won't work...</p>
