<p>is there any way to use Full Calendar from site Fullcalendar.io on localhost without network connection? My issue is, when I changed any property of event in events array at jQuery function and then reload page in browser unconnected to internet, I cannot see any difference, it doesn't render changes. When I'm connected to internet, it works as expected. I also tested demos from archive of calendar, it's doing the same. I checked links for stylesheets and scripts files but I didn't find any of them loaded from online sources. Google Calendar I won't use so I think that there can be some solution but I don't know where is the problem. Thanks for any response.</p>
