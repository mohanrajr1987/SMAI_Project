<p>I'm looking to find out if there is an option to change the way <code>basicView</code> for <code>fullcalendar.js</code> is displayed.  When I display my calendar in <code>basicView</code> I get something like this:</p>  <pre> 9/13 9/14 9/15 9/16 9/17... </pre>  <p>when I would like it to display something like this:</p>  <pre> 13 14 15 16 17...    // No month, just days </pre>  <p>I've looked through the <a href="http://fullcalendar.io/docs/" rel="nofollow">documentation</a> for about an hour and can't find anything to change this.</p>
