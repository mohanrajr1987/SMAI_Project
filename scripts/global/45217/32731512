<p>Using full calendar in combination with date picker, I am adding disabled class to days that are prior to the date in date picker. While everything works if I use the date on a different month in combination with:</p>  <pre><code>.fullCalendar('gotoDate', date) </code></pre>  <p>Selecting a date from the current month will not execute dayRender so disabled class will not be added in this view. This is, of course, due to calendar not re-rendering. I tried using rerended but that did not work.</p>  <p>Any way to get this done? See fiddle below plz.</p>  <p><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/fedorsmirnoff/80zb78ap/" rel="nofollow">demo</a></p>
