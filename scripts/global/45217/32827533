<p>I am having issues with multiple calendars bringing data in to my FullCalendar.</p>  <p>Is there any functionality that allows calendar events to be ordered chronologically by start time (i.e. 9am start showing above 10am start) and this functionality being maintained across the different calendars?</p>  <p>At present, it appears that my events are being displayed at random and grouped within the separate calendars.</p>  <p>I've attached a screenshot of the outcome, and would appreciate any ideas as to what could be causing this seemingly random output of data and how I can fix it in a way that is logical to the user.</p>  <p><a href="http://imgur.com/l3Kc4x3" rel="nofollow">http://imgur.com/l3Kc4x3</a></p>
