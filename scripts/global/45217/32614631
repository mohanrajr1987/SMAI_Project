<p>I have created a booking system which uses a clients username from their log in to auto populate a user name field when making a booking. I am not sure of how to get other information like their full name and ID from the database into these fields. Below is the code I have used to verify log in and store their username:</p>  <pre><code>  &lt;?php      // Start up your PHP Session      session_start();      // If the user is not logged in send him/her to the login form     if ($_SESSION["Login"] != "YES_client") {       header("Location: login.php");     }      $username = $_SESSION["username"];     ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I have also implemented the user name in the field using the following code:</p>  <pre><code>echo "&lt;input type='text' name='name' class='form-control' id='FullInputName' value=" . $username . "&gt;" </code></pre>  <p>Is there something simple I am missing? I have tried various methods to display the full data like using <code>$row["Client_ID"]</code> etc but could not get this to work for only the client who is logged into the system. My SQL statement is as follows:</p>  <pre><code>"SELECT * FROM client WHERE Client_username= $username" </code></pre>  <p>I would like to use the <code>Client_ID</code> in the select statement also to make it Unique. I have tried but got various errors.</p>  <p>Any help would be much appreciated! </p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>  <p>This is the code I have now tried to implement:</p>  <pre><code>$query = "SELECT * FROM client WHERE Client_username='$username'";             echo $query;             $result = mysql_query($query);               while($row = mysql_fetch_array($result))             {                 echo $row['Client_username'];             } </code></pre>  <p>But it is not working correctly - I am receiving this error:</p>  <pre><code>mysql_fetch_array() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given </code></pre>
