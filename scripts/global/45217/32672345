<p>I'm trying to load events to FullCalendar from dynamic JSON in <code>get-events.php</code>. In <code>get-events.php</code> there is a line to load content from static JSON:</p>  <pre><code>$json = file_get_contents(dirname(__FILE__) . '/../json/events.json'); $input_arrays = json_decode($json, true); </code></pre>  <p>However, my JSON file is generated from a MySQL database and that doesn't work.</p>  <p>All I need is speed up FullCalendar. I have huge event base up to 10 000 events starting from 2013 until today, and it's very slow when FullCalendar get only one month from all this base. Any idea how to load events using <code>startParm</code> and <code>endParm</code> by <code>POST</code>?</p>
