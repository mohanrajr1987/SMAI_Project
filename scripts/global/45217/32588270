<p>I would like to be able to force the calender to display the last week of the previous month and continue display the rest of the current month for every month.</p>  <p>For example, if the current month is september, the first case (top left) should be 25th of august and continue 26,27....until the 24th of september (or the rest of it if not possible to set an end date). Thank you in advance.</p>
