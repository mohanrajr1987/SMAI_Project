<p>I'm using fullcalendar with drag-drop external events and json data source.  These events repeat weekly by default. </p>  <p>I want to now add functionality that enables a user to delete a single instance of this repeating event (like in google calendar). I believe this will require some sort of mechanism to exclude a certain event date from a repeating event.</p>  <p>I wasn't able to find anything in the fullcalendar documentation that would support this sort of behaviour out-of-the-box. </p>  <p>I would prefer a client-side only solution to this.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
