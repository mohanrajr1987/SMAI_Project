<p>I was wondering on to have an event every hour on every day in the AgendayDay view. I customized the timeslots to be an hour long. I will be filling the title/description with values from the database. I seen some questions answered for recurring events every monday for an example. </p>  <p>EDIT: I get the recurring event every monday as an example. <strong>I'm asking how do you create a different event for every HOUR without creating an event manually.</strong></p>  <p>Something like this but for everyday. Of course, not every event will have the same value.<a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/7WCLA.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/7WCLA.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
