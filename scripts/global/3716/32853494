<p>I'm using serial communication over USB and on start of the application, device is already connected and thing works fine. When I disconnect the device (Symulation an error) the application doesnt break,and if I try to reopen serialport from application it has no effect. Later , debugger says that disposal happend.  I want to know, how to restore connection dynamically when device reconnects again. It all loops in timer</p>  <pre><code>protected override void Dispose(bool disposing)         {             if (disposing &amp;&amp; (components != null))             {                 components.Dispose(); ===&gt; Exception is pointing at this             }             base.Dispose(disposing);         } </code></pre>
