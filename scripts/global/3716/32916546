<p>I have an application that is communicating to a device over serial port, i would really like to inspect the protocol for what it is sending to initiate the link, and make an application that runs across TCPIP instead.</p>  <p>The thing is, i dont have a serial port on my machine ofcourse as no machines has that today.</p>  <p>What i thought i could do was to install a Virtual Serial Port on my windows 7 : </p>  <p><a href="http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm</a> - and make that appear as a COM port, installing it doesnt give me any new ports though so no clue how that is supposed to work.</p>  <p>My thinking was i could in this driver set it up to communicate to a IP address instead of a physical device, but seems windows want a device connected physically to show a new port ?</p>  <p>Am i doing something totally wrong here ? anyone knows how it can be done ? </p>  <p>I saw other products online and tried also to install the com0com it does give some drivers but not sure exactly how they can be setup or if that is something that can achieve what im trying to do. </p>  <p>Its a hobby project so dont really have the money to try to purchase some of the non-free applications that appears to say they can do it - so wonder if theres a standard or free package that can do it.</p>
