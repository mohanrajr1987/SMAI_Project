<p>I am trying to compare 2 strings one coming from Pyserial and the other is a hardcoded messsage. They seem to be exaclty the same but for some reason the function wait_prompt only return 0.</p>  <pre><code> def wait_prompt(device, msg):         device.write("\n\n")         device.flush()          msg = msg + "\n"         output = device.readline()          print("\n")         print("Looking for: " + msg + "|end")         print("CLI shows: " + output + "|end")          if output == msg:                 return 1         return 0  def initialize_router(device):          print ("Router connected on port " + port[0])          while wait_prompt(device, "Would you like to enter the initial configuration dialog? [yes/no]: ") == 0:                 time.sleep(1)          device.write("no\n")         device.flush()          while wait_prompt(device, "Line protocol on Interface Vlan1, changed state to up") == 0:                 time.sleep(1)          time.sleep(2)         device.write("\n")         device.flush() </code></pre>  <p>While I'm at it, would there be any better way to commumnicate with a terminal over a consol cable ? I saw pexpect, however it does not seem to work in serial.</p>  <p>SOLUTION</p>  <p>the problem was that the output was returning \r\r\n at the end and not just \n like i was expecting. I modified the code to search for only a part of the string to validate the test. Here it is:</p>  <pre><code>def wait_prompt(device, msg):         device.write("\n\n")         device.flush()         output = device.readline()          if msg in output:                 return 1         return 0  def initialize_router(device):          print ("Router connected on port " + port[0])          while wait_prompt(device, "[yes/no]:") == 0:                 time.sleep(1)          device.write("no\n")         device.flush()          while wait_prompt(device, "Line protocol on Interface Vlan1, changed state to up") == 0:                 time.sleep(1)          time.sleep(2)         device.write("\n")         device.flush() </code></pre>
