<p>I have a program that read certain-formatted data from comport. The data is generated from a physical device. But currently I don't have the device and I have to test my program. </p>  <p>Is there a program that creates a virtual comport and sends custom data to comport and lets another program to read the comport at the same time.</p>  <p><em>I have found some programs that I can create virtual comports and send data to them. But when I try to send data to that comport by test program, the comport is opened and I can not re-open it by my program.</em></p>
