<p>I have a few problems regarding matlab and c#. What I want to do is to bring a certain piece of code I have from matlab to c#. The problem is whenever I read the serialport, the data in matlab is fine and everything works as intended, but c# just completely messes it up and I do not know why.</p>  <p>Regarding that problem here are a few of the code snippets, which I think matter and my 'translations' for c#:</p>  <p>This is my code to open the serialport. I know the if close if there is any data on the port is missing, but that should not be a concern as the data is always there in my case.</p>  <p>MATLAB:</p>  <pre><code>if ~isempty (instrfind)     fclose (instrfind); end s = serial('COMPort4',...     'BaudRate', 56000,...     'Parity', 'none',...     'DataBits', 8,...     'StopBits', 1,...     'InputBufferSize', 65552,...     'OutputBufferSize', 32768,...     'Terminator','CR',...     'Timeout', 2); fopen(s); </code></pre>  <p>C#:</p>  <pre><code>SerialPort radarCom = new SerialPort("COM4", 56000,  Parity.None, 8, StopBits.One); radarCom.WriteBufferSize = 16384; radarCom.ReadBufferSize = 32768; radarCom.ReadTimeout = 2; radarCom.WriteTimeout = 2; Console.Out.NewLine = "\r"; radarCom.Open(); </code></pre>  <p>Next I have certain commands to communicate with the controller via serialport where certain variables are used. Here is a command where i send the same command via serialport if I did not do something wrong:</p>  <p>MATLAB:</p>  <pre><code>Ndiv=['set_Ndiv ',num2str(PLL_22)] fprintf(s,Ndiv);   </code></pre>  <p>C#:</p>  <pre><code>string Ndiv =  "set_Ndiv "+ Convert.ToString(PLL_22) ; radarCom.WriteLine(Ndiv);   </code></pre>  <p>After that I read the data from the serial port. However the result in matlab are a lot of numbers like 32534, 31534 etc., but in c# i get a weird mix of ????332/u???"????????\u011??????"????*???? or something similiar. I guess u get the idea of what i mean. However, here is the code how I read the serialport:</p>  <p>Matlab:</p>  <pre><code>for n = 1:10000     fprintf(s,'go');     data= fread(s,100,'uint16'); end </code></pre>  <p>C#:</p>  <pre><code>for(int i=1; i&lt;=10000; i++) {     radarCom.WriteLine("go");      if (radarCom.BytesToRead != -1)     {         var data = radarCom.ReadExisting();         Console.WriteLine(data);     } } </code></pre>  <p>I hope you can help me. I think the problem lies within the last read command in matlab and I do not know how to properly translate it into c#.</p>
