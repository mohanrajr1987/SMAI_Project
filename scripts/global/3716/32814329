<p>I need advice on setting up a web server on a Raspberry Pi that can communicate with the serial port.</p>  <p>Im leaning towards doing this i php/python/nodejs or c if necessary.</p>  <p>Requirements: 1. incoming data on serial port => update webpage through web sockets 2. some event on webpage => send data to serial port</p>  <p>A continuous loop to check for serial data will be heavy on the cpu. Is there any way to get an event on incoming serial data and then read it? Found <a href="https://github.com/voodootikigod/node-serialport" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/voodootikigod/node-serialport</a> that has an on data event. Is that a good option?</p>  <p>Can the serial communication be handled by the web server or will i have to create a service?</p>
