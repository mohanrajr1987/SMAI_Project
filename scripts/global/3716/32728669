<p>Is there a way to use <code>System.Management.ManagementObjectSearcher</code> class to find not just serial devices to connect to, but narrow it down to viewing which serial ports <em>are not in use (open) by an arbitrary application</em>?</p>  <pre><code>My current method for finding available ports:  Dim searcher As New ManagementObjectSearcher("root\cimv2", "SELECT * FROM Win32_PnPEntity WHERE Name LIKE '%USB%Serial%Port%'") </code></pre>  <p><code>IsOpen()</code> does not seem to suffice as an indicator for whether the port name is open or not, even for ports opened elsewhere in the application. My only strategy right now is to open within try/catch.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
