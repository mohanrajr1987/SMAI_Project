<p>I have a C# Form Application that talks to an Arduino.  I want to make sure that the port I'm trying to connect to is the right one. It connects to the right port, but when the port is another one, the application becomes blocked. I checked, and in the try block, port.ReadLine() triggers a TimeoutException. But the Form becomes unresponsive.</p>  <pre><code> private bool isPortToArduino(SerialPort port)     {         String response = null;          port.Write("a");         try         {             response = port.ReadLine();          }         catch(TimeoutException exc)         {             Console.WriteLine(exc);         }          if (response == "y\r")             return true;         return false;     } </code></pre>
