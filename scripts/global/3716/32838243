<p>I am trying to implement <code>ReadAll</code> method using <code>SerialPort</code>, which will ensure it reads as many bytes as told to (I want to use this function for reading from serial port). Is this implementation correct way to go about this?</p>  <pre><code>public static void ReadWholeArray (SerialPort sp, byte[] data) {     int offset=0;     int remaining = data.Length; // ensure we read this many bytes     while (remaining &gt; 0)     {         int read = sp.Read(data, offset, remaining);         if (read &lt;= 0)             throw new EndOfStreamException                  (String.Format("End of data reached with {0} bytes left to read", remaining));         remaining -= read;         offset += read;     } } </code></pre>  <p><strong>PS. Is there necessity for similar <code>WriteAll</code> method? (or does Write ensure to write as many bytes it was told to?).</strong></p>
