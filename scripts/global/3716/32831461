<p>I'm trying to communicate with a <a href="http://www.dataq.com/products/di-245/" rel="nofollow">Di245</a> through its Virtual COM driver (VCD) in Linux (<a href="http://www.dataq.com/resources/pdfs/support_articles/DI-245-protocol.pdf" rel="nofollow">pdf</a>) and I'm having a strange issue. Internally, an FTDI chipset is used by this device (FT232BL).</p>  <p>Attaching the device by itself isn't registered as a VCD, so I do the following:</p>  <pre><code>sudo modprobe usbserial vendor=0x0683 product=0x2450 </code></pre>  <p>which results in the following <code>dmesg</code> message:</p>  <pre><code>usbserial: USB Serial support registered for generic usbserial_generic 3-3:1.0: The "generic" usb-serial driver is only for testing and one-off prototypes. usbserial_generic 3-3:1.0: Tell linux-usb@vger.kernel.org to add your device to a proper driver. usbserial_generic 3-3:1.0: generic converter detected usb 3-3: generic converter now attached to ttyUSB0 </code></pre>  <p>and I get the <code>/dev/ttyUSB0</code> device as promised. So far, everything seems ok.</p>  <p>However, if I open the port in my code, I get a bunch of <code>1`</code> from it (alternating <code>1</code> and <code>`</code>). Trying with <code>screen</code>:</p>  <pre><code>screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200 </code></pre>  <p>I continuously receive <code>1`</code>. This is definitely not something the device is sending and oddly enough, if I put a random baudrate, I keep getting the same thing.</p>  <p>Is this a way some error is being reported? What could be triggering this behavior and how can I address it?</p>
