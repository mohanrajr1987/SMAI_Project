<p>I'm trying to get some data from the com port, the same one I'm writing data on, but it proves hard to read. I managed to find a simple code piece to read it, but now, I only read zeros. What could be the cause?</p>  <p>I'm sending my code below, with explanation of their intended usages.</p>  <pre><code>private void ReadFromComPortActionPerformed(java.awt.event.ActionEvent evt) {                                                     try {         String text = EmulatorInput.getText();         sendData(text, "COM4");         String out_Text = Arrays.toString(read());         EmulatorOutput.setText(out_Text);         System.out.println(out_Text);     } catch (IOException ex) {             Logger.getLogger(MainWindow.class.getName()).log(Level.SEVERE, null, ex);     } }   </code></pre>  <p>This is a JButton, method name and parameter has been created by NetBeans. Code firsts gets a text from the input panel as a string, sends it with a com port name, connects to that port, and opens input/output streams by it, then writes the string it took from the input panel to the OutputStream. Then, I create a new string, named <code>out_Text</code> and use <code>read()</code> method to read the data from port.</p>  <p>Here is the read method;</p>  <pre><code>private byte[] read() throws IOException {     byte[] buffer = new byte[16];     int total = 0, read = 0;     while (total &lt;= 16 &amp;&amp; (read = input.read(buffer, total, 16-total)) &gt; 0)  {         total += read;     }     return buffer; } </code></pre>  <p>After the first method I posted uses <code>read()</code> to converge it into a string that I can print as a byte array, I end up with only a byte of zeros.</p>  <pre><code>[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] </code></pre>  <p>I'm very confused by this, because I'm sure I write to the port. I even monitored what I write, and can see that as I use the program to write data to the com port, the data it received increases.</p>  <p>If there is something that is unclear or if you need more of the code, please contact via comments.</p>  <p>Thank you kindly.</p>
