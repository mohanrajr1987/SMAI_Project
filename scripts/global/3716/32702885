<p>I have two Arduinos now used by my program. SInce I'm on Linux and new to Linux, the port isn't static, like "com3" and "com6", I think it's "ttyUSB0" for the first Arduino which is connected, and "ttyUSB1" for the second and so on. But since both are connected when the OS boots, can I be certain that the port names will remain the same? Or is there some other way to access ports by name?</p>
