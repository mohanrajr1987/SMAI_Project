<p>We have two test stands, one hooked up to Com port 1, and another on COM3. The device on Com3 (lets call it Stand3) was experiencing issues; the technician concluded it was a burnt out traveling head, and asked for a replacement.</p>  <p>At the same time, the hardware on Com1 (stand1) was also experiencing problems; the device was unresponsive to control through the port -- normally, we would consider this a communication issue, and a reboot of the desktop and test stand would resolve this issue. However, this did not succeed.</p>  <p>After a few weeks and debugging of stand1 hardware, the replacement for stand3 came in; apparently, both the stand and serial port for stand3 were replaced, according to an email from the technician.  After this change occurred, stand1 started working again.</p>  <p>Why would a damaged test stand/serial USB port be affecting communication to com1, which is hard-wired? What is causing this?</p>
