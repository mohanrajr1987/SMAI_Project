<p>Followup question to this: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32702885/permanent-usb-port-names-linux">permanent USB port names? (Linux)</a></p>  <p>On Windows the port names don't change between actual physical ports. They are along the lines of "COM3", "COM6", etc. On Linux, if I plug one USB device first , it will be "ttyUSB0" and if I plug the same device second in any other physical port it will be "ttyUSB1". That won't work if I want to, say, have 2 Arduinos connected via Pyserial to the PC.</p>  <p>In the above answer I was shown a way to get an IP-like "serial name". How can I feed that to the PySerial class instead?</p>
