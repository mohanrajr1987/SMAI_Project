<p>I'm developing an application that will need to send high speed data via a serial link (network won't work here) between two linux systems. A pair of USB serial (RS-232) adapters with a null modem cable works correctly but is <strong><em>way</em></strong> too slow at much less than a Mb/s. A USB direct link cable (e.g. <a href="http://www.usbgear.com/link/" rel="nofollow">this</a>) for transferring files between computers is <em>much</em> faster but (I think) presents as a storage device on either end, and I need it to present as a serial line. Are there any products that link USB to USB as a serial line running at full USB bus speed? If not, any recommendations for what it would take to create such a thing?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
