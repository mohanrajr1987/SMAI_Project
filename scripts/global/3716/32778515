<p>I typically need 4 serial console windows in parallel. I can open 4 minicom instances in 4 terminal windows by hand, this is not the problem. But I want to open them by script.</p>  <p>My Idea was to create a shell script like this:</p>  <pre><code>#!/bin/bash gnome-terminal -e minicom ttyS4 gnome-terminal -e minicom ttyS5 ... </code></pre>  <p>But unfortunately this doesn't work with minicom. I tried gnome-terminal without minicom. This gives me several terminals as expected, but somehow minicom interferes here.</p>  <p>I als tried </p>  <pre><code>exec gnome-terminal -e minicom ttyS4 </code></pre>  <p>this also doesn't open a new terminal window, but launched minicom in the current terminal.</p>  <p>Any ideas, how I can open multiple minicom connections by script? OS is Ubuntu 12.04</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
