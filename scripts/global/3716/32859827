<p>By referencing the source in the following link : <a href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Serial-Programming-HOWTO/x115.html#AEN125" rel="nofollow">Serial_Port_Programming_How_To</a></p>  <p>I found out that there are c_cc character configurations there. After searching around the affections, I did not find the exact answer to this. I try to comment out each line of these c_cc configurations and found out the following line does affect the output.</p>  <pre><code>newtio.c_cc[VEOF]     = 4; </code></pre>  <p>Can anyone explain the meaning of this and possibly for the rest of these?</p>  <p>Thanks </p>
