<p>I am new to windows and I am making a hobby project using universal app. A few days down the road I found that the only way to hook up a serial port it to use async methods from and related to SerialDevice class.</p>  <p>I liked generic advise on the topic: once you got to use one serial api it will be much easier to covert whole app to async starting right from 'Main' (<a href="http://blog.stephencleary.com/2012/02/async-and-await.html" rel="nofollow">http://blog.stephencleary.com/2012/02/async-and-await.html</a>) than deal with issues related to sync calls to async methods.</p>  <p>However, universal application created by VS2015 contains ton of generated non-async code that is not intended to be comprehensible. I suppose there is a general pattern somewhere do deal with this issue but I could not find any trace of it. So what should I do?</p>
