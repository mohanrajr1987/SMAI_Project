<p>I need to control mouse pointer and keyboard input for 5 keys on desktop (Linux) using a device controlled by microcontoller. The microcontoller is connected to my desktop through serial port. The microcontroller can send values of mouse pointer movement(x, y), clicks and pressed keys through serial port to the desktop. Do I need to write a device driver from scratch or is there a device driver file that I can study and edit to implement my project? I have no experience with Linux device drivers.</p>  <p>Thank you!</p>
