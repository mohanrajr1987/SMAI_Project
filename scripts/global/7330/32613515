<p>I didn't know how to properly ask the question and for that I apologize.</p>  <p>Basically I want to know how can I set up eclipse to recognize the version of the project I am working on and how many revisions etc.</p>  <p>I had this working on CVS but for some reason on GIT I can't get it to work.</p>  <p>On CVS I had this block of comment code</p>  <pre><code>/*  * ${file_name}  *  * Version:  * $$Id$$  * Revisions:  * $$Log$$  */ </code></pre>  <p>And of course it would display the file name, version and revision. With GIT it does nothing...</p>  <p>I googled as much as I could and found no answer, hopefully one of you guys can help me out. Thanks</p>
