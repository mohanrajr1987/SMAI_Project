<p>I have a working SVN repository (CollabNet Subversion Edge 4.0.11)  on Windows (2012 R2) with 62200 or so revs.  I am moving it to a Linux RedHat 6.6 (CollabNet version 1.8.13) with Apache/2.2.29. I understand the best way to migrate is to dump the repository. So I ran the following dump command: </p>  <pre><code>svnadmin dump -r 1:62268 F:\csvn\data\repositories\repos &gt; G:\MyDump.dump </code></pre>  <p>When I try to dump the windows repository I get an error at revision 4255: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>svnadmin: E200002: Serialized hash malformed.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Next I run just after that point another dump cause I think I can sort that out by merging the adjacent revisions into the corrupted one so I run the following command:</p>  <pre><code>svnadmin dump -r 4257:62268 F:\csvn\data\repositories\repos &gt; G:\My2dump.dump </code></pre>  <p>This comes up with a new error at revision 16153 that has me puzzled: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>svnadmin: E140001: zlib (uncompress): corrupt data: Decompression of   svndiff data failed</p> </blockquote>  <p>Then when I run a third dump, as I am a glutton or punishment. I use the following command:</p>  <pre><code>svnadmin dump -r 16154:62268 F:\csvn\data\repositories\repos &gt; G:\My3dump.dump </code></pre>  <p>But it simply hangs and seems to be doing nothing. This repository goes back 10+ years and only the past 6 years is relevant. Can I somehow modify the dump to extract the past X number of years or revisions from the present that are not corrupt and load that into the new Repository? So I would dump starting from the present and go backwards so to speak? (just a thought) I dont have any good backups as those servers and tapes are gone with the last company move.  Thanks, davidf</p>
