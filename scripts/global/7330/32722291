<p>Based on the git documentation: <a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-shortlog" rel="nofollow">http://git-scm.com/docs/git-shortlog</a></p>  <blockquote>   <p>The .mailmap feature is used to coalesce together commits by the same   person in the shortlog, where their name and/or email address was   spelled differently.</p> </blockquote>  <p>It <strong>seems</strong> .mailmap file format allows only mapping (key, value pairs), meaning that if a user has more than 1 alias it will not be alive.</p>  <p>In my git repo there are a user who commits under/from 4 different mail address OR commit name...</p>  <p>Is there any way/workaround or something which I do not notice, to add add a user with e.g. 3 different mail address or commit name?</p>
