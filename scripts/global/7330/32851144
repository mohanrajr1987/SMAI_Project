<p>I'm not able to create public repositories on github. When I try to create a new repo a red message appears telling me <code>Something went wrong</code></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ndt17.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ndt17.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>And, it actually doesn't matter what I type</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Z0S30.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Z0S30.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Any suggestions what this might be ?</p>  <p>UPDATE: I found out that it is an issue related to my Chrome browser. If I use FF it works again. Now, I just signed out in Chrome and when I try to login again I get the following</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/md9Vh.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/md9Vh.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>UPDATE 2: A shutdown finally fixed the issue. It might be related to a full disk I had previously. We will never know :)</p>
