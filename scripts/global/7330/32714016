<p>Currently I try to import a external git repository into my own repository.</p>  <p>Concretely: I have my own git repository (I call it 'projectRepo') in this repository I will checkout a branch from the Linux kernel repository in a hierarchy like this:</p>  <p><code>projectRepo   -kernelFolder   -otherStuff</code></p>  <p>Now I preferred to commit the changes in kernelFolder to my 'projectRepo' and also the information which branch is used from the kernel repository should commited to my projecRepo. (Maybe I like also to switch between different kernel branches)</p>  <p>The goal is, that I can checkout my projectRepo on every system so that I have already the configurations and so on from the kernelFolder...</p>  <p>I read something about "git submodule" but in this case, I commit all changes to the external (kernel) repository and I don't want that...</p>  <p>Sorry for the basic question about git. I think it give a simple solution for this problem...</p>  <p>Thanks For your support! Cheers</p>
