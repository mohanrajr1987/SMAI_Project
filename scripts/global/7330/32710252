<p>When I using the following API script to save an object,it just hangs up and no result...</p>  <pre><code>link,c,object_id,/temp1/temp2 save,c,object_id </code></pre>  <p>Also I have other test like ：</p>  <ol> <li>create a new dm_folder object and link to /temp1/temp2, object created.</li> <li>update dm_folder object to link and unlink, object is linked and unlinked to expected folder paths.</li> </ol>  <p>All the above two steps works, but not the ‘save’, why?</p>  <p>Could you guys give me some advice on this issue?</p>
