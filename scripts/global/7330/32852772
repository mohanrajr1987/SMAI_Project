<p>I have Repositories and services. The services either orchestrate multiple repository calls or doing some in memory data logic merged with the repository calls so that I want to return DTO's. These DTOs are then perfect trimmed for the UI. But... I use asp.net mvc and my services will return DTO's to the mvc controller where I should need viewmodels. But my DTO's already nearly are like the ViewModels. The only exception is that my DTO`s do not have Validation attributes because that really belongs on the viewmodels.</p>  <p>What else can I do if using DTO and viewmodels together seem to much?</p>
