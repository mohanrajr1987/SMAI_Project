<p>I work with Power Designer 16.1 and I believe I have an issue with the repository. Most of time I do checkIn of models without any problems. But sometimes I lost completely the model from repository so I am obliged to do check in of my last local version, what makes me lose all the historical works of colleague.</p>  <p>After some analysis (and I may be wrong) I think that the problem occurred when someone try to do check-in and did not finalize the work ( took more time that needed) and someone else in the same time try to do check. The Models will disappears from repository confusion of the path.</p>  <p>If someone already had this problem and could help please?</p>
