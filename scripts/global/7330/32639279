<p>What the users hoping to do are: 1)  The ability to relocate one sub-repo from tpm-research to tpm-pe and still retain all the revision history 2)  The ability to do svn:externals in case I like to construct a working copy from different sub-components of two repositories</p>  <p>How should I design these two repositories, tpm-research and tpm-pe? Just two repositories?</p>  <p>Thanks Jirong</p>
