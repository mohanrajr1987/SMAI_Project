<p><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/repository-metadata-on-github-pages/" rel="nofollow">It is possible to access repository metadata from a Jekyll site hosted in a <code>gh-pages</code> branch on GitHub</a>. </p>  <p>I am now building a site where it'd help enormously if I had access to the metadata of another (of my) repositories (here called a <em>third-party</em> repository because technically it is that).</p>  <p>Is there any way I can set up Jekyll so that I can use metadata from that third-party repo? I.e., make Jekyll able to use metadata from two repositories rather than just the local <code>{{ site.github }}</code> one?</p>
