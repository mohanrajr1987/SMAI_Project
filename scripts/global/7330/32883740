<p>I am asking this question because I have tried every single answer posted in the forum but none worked for me.</p>  <p>I tried the following answers to download a single file "testfile.txt" from remote Git repository but none worked:</p>  <p><strong>Command 1</strong></p>  <pre><code>git archive --remote=git://10.10.10.5/project.git HEAD testfile </code></pre>  <p>Getting following error:</p>  <pre><code>errno=Connection timed out fatal: unable to connect a socket (Connection timed out) </code></pre>  <p><strong>Command 2</strong></p>  <pre><code>git archive --remote=ssh://10.10.10.5/project.git HEAD testfile </code></pre>  <p>Error: This prompts for my ssh key password which I entered but then it prompts me for root password afterwards and that does not exist.</p>  <pre><code>Enter passphrase for key '/root/.ssh/id_rsa': root@10.10.10.5's password: Permission denied, please try again. </code></pre>  <p>So at this stage I am wondering what I have done wrong. Any help will be appreciated.</p>  <p>Note:</p>  <p>I am connecting from my local server as <strong>root</strong> and accessing the git server which has a <strong>git</strong> user account</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>  <p>I made some changes to one of the commands as follows:</p>  <pre><code>git archive --remote=ssh://git@10.10.10.5/home/git/project.git HEAD local1.json </code></pre>  <p>this prompts for ssh key and then I get following but can't find the file</p>  <pre><code>Enter passphrase for key '/root/.ssh/id_rsa': pax_global_header0000666000000000000000000000006412603247310088520gustar00rootroot0000000000000052 comment=e5c6e52614cccd39797bc17e7d11c4d2f7893b18 local1.json000066400000000000000000000000131260276633100131240ustar00rootroot00000000000000V2 updated </code></pre>
