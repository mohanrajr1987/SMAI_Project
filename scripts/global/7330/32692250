<p>I use this package to manage my translations: <a href="https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-translation-manager" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-translation-manager</a></p>  <p>The translations are stored in a DB table, and a file such as <code>messages.php</code> is generated by user action.</p>  <p>It breaks down my git actions, as I am often unable to pull from repo ("local changes will be overwritten" error).</p>  <p>My question: How i can push the lang files, all updated lang files stored in particular folder (<code>resources/lang</code>)  to repository (at BitBucket).</p>
