<p>Can another repository be added to a maven sub module?</p>  <p>I added a repository in the sub module pom using the <code>&lt;repositories&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;repository&gt;</code> tags, because I don't have access to the parent pom where the main repository is defined.</p>  <p>I added a dependency on an artifact in the new repository, but it is not found, indicated by my IDE, and when doing a maven build the output is that the artifact is not found in the main repository.</p>  <p>Can an additional repository be added to a maven sub module?</p>
