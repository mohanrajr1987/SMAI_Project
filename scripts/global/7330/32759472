<p>I have an asp.net mvc project on Git. We also have lots of other files e.g. documentation in *.pdf, database scripts in the <em>.sql and models in the form of images (</em>.png, *.jpg). We also want to have this in Git, but the question is where?</p>  <p>Create new folders in the project e.g. docs, db-scripts, etc and commit that with the project?</p>  <p>Create a new branch with the documentation and the db-script?</p>  <p>Create a new git repository?</p>
