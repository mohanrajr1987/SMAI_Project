<p>I have a project with a number of git submodules, one of which I've recently updated to a newer revision. It seems that my Xcode bot still wants to point to the older revision, as seen in the Repositories section of the Edit Bot screen (and by the build error I get when I try to integrate). Is there a way to update the bot to use the correct revision?</p>  <p>I see that I am able to select different branches with no problem, but there is no apparent UI to change to an arbitrary revision (or even a tag).</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/l3ZZq.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/l3ZZq.png" alt="Edit Repositories"></a></p>  <p>Apparently Xcode Server has a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Xcode/Conceptual/XcodeServerAPIReference/Bots.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40016472-CH2-SW1" rel="nofollow">RESTful API</a> which has the ability to edit bots, but so far, all PATCH requests that I have made to the bot's URI result in the following error:</p>  <pre><code>{   "status": 400,   "message": "the body is empty" } </code></pre>  <p>I've gone so far as to try poking around in Xcode Server's CouchDB, and found what I believe to be the correct document to update (under the <code>all-bots</code> view), but making changes there doesn't seem to have an effect. Guessing the caching layer doesn't know that the document has been updated. Restarting Xcode Server after the edit has no effect.</p>  <p>I really would like to avoid re-creating the bot because it's a pain to set up all of my triggers again, and I lose the history from previous integrations.</p>
