<p>Until now, I've been working on a project with a single and reliable agency.</p>  <p>However, I'd now like to speed up development by entrusting a few subjects to side developers. That means they need to access the repo, though I don't want them to get access to critical code.</p>  <p>Is there a way to grant them only a partial access to the repo (only the files I decided to show them), or to create (and maintain) a side repository, which doesn't includes some files/folders that I want to keep unknown to them ?</p>  <p>In other terms, I'd like these side developpers to work on the repo without granting them access to critical assets.</p>
