<p>I am working on Power Designer 16.1, the repository is installed on a Linux server. I have an issue with the repository sometimes dropping my models, in most cases I am able to check-in the models to the repository and check-out correctly, but sometimes after I correctly check-in a model it seems that it is being deleted from the repository. I am not sure but I think the problem may occur when two (or more) people tries to check-in the same model at the same time (or overlapping), and that causes the model to dissapear from the repository. Any idea or workaround to fix this? post le sur le forum powerdesigner de sap</p>
