<p>I've installed Laravel on my Raspberry Pi 2 using PHP 5.6.13 (Raspbian OS). Everything has worked well until I attempted to do a migration with <code>php artisan migrate</code>. That resulted in the error <code>[PDOException] could not find driver</code>. </p>  <p>I haven't been able to figure out what I'm missing. I've installed the <code>php5-mysql</code> module using apt. I've set the <code>extension_dir</code> in <code>php.ini</code> as well as <code>extension=pdo_mysql.so</code>.</p>  <p>I know I can use Homestead but I would prefer to understand what is missing in my current set up, so please refrain from suggesting Homestead.</p>  <p>Does anyone have any idea what I could be missing? It's driving me crazy!</p>
