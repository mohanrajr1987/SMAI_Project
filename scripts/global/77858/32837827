<p>I have a python script which uses this curl command:</p>  <pre><code>stream = os.popen("curl -s 'http://someip/json.htm?type=devices&amp;rid=7'| jq -r .result[].Data") </code></pre>  <p>When i loaded this script at the boot of my raspberrypi by the fowwlong cron</p>  <pre><code>@reboot /usr/bin/screen -dmSL elec /home/pi/domoticz/scripts/python/elec.py </code></pre>  <p>Everything was fine. But since few days, i have this error:</p>  <pre><code>sh: 1: jq: not found </code></pre>  <p>If I stop the script and restart it everything is ok.</p>  <p>Everyone has an idea to solve that?</p>
