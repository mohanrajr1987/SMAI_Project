<p>I am new to raspberry pi. I want to develop small program using Raspberry Pi. What are the options I have for remote update of Raspberry Pi which I will be giving to my users.</p>  <p>For example I am in New York and my user is in Atlanta and Chicago. Once i give the raspberry pi with added NodeJS and node program to them. How can i update it remotely if i want to modify the program or update the OS itself, in case they have any issues considering the fact they have no technical knowledge ?</p>  <p>Is there anyway to control that entire Pi remotely ?</p>  <p>I know the SSH options but that will be on the same network right ?</p>  <p>Some expert help would be great.</p>
