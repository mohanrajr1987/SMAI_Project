<p>I'm trying since days to write and develop programs on my host pc (Ubuntu 64bit) using qt-creator for my beaglebone and raspberry pi devices. I looked for 'qt-creator cross compile beagle, raspberry etc...' and it leads me to hundred of links and tutorial on <em>how to compile qt-creator for my target plattform</em>. But seriously, that not my idea. All what I want is to simply use my pc for developing my programs  and lately deploy them to the remote device.</p>  <p>So first of all a noob question: <strong><em>Is something wrong with my idea? Should I really compile the source of qt for beaglebone or raspberry on my pc for writing programs which lately should be run on that devices????</em></strong></p>  <p>I will not compile qt-creator again for another plattform, so I don't know how to find the right way. A lot of informations on internet are misleading.</p>  <p>So after many hours spend look for the right information I come up with the following procedure:</p>  <p>first I installed a arm-gnu toolchain on my 64bit Ubuntu.</p>  <pre><code>sudo apt-get install build-essential libc6-armhf-cross libc6-dev-armhf-cross binutils-arm-linux-gnueabihf linux-libc-dev-armhf-cross libstdc++6-armhf-cross gcc-4.8-arm-linux-gnueabihf g++-4.8-arm-linux-gnueabihf </code></pre>  <p>then I installed qt-creator from the repository on my Ubuntu:</p>  <pre><code>sudo apt-get install qtcreator </code></pre>  <p>I tried to configure to use qt for compiling my projects using the toolchain for arm (see following pictures)</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/hb3FV.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/hb3FV.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>and here:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/vYfJB.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/vYfJB.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>but it seems that qt-creator doesn't recognize the new kit when I start a new project:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/FxMyQ.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/FxMyQ.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Now: I m really confused, I could think that the problem is related to qt, but I m not sure, whether the way of thinking, that I can compile on ubuntu 64bit and then run my application on the remote device is right or not.</p>  <p>For this reason it would be nice if you can answer the question above.</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE: What happen if I add a QT-Version in my  Kit???</strong></p>  <p>It happens that the gnueabi compiler conflicts with that options and the following problem arises:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/vFS70.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/vFS70.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I would like to say again that I don't need to use qt-library or something like that on my remote device. I need just to use the qt-IDE as IDE for my projects (mainly c or c++ plain projects)</p>
