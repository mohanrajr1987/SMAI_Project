Currently, the data is being retrieved by a Raspberry Pi and then stored it into an PHP Apache Sever. How do I display the data located in the PHP Apache Sever into my App continuously. For my App, I have created it using Android Studio.</p>  <p>Thank You for your time and answering my question.</p>
