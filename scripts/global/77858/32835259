<p>I'm extremely frustrated. I don't know python, but I'm using it in a prototyping class. What I want to do is use the GPIO pin on my RPi to light up an LED. That part I got, no problem. But now I want to add a button and have it blink when the button is pressed and continue to blink after the button is released. Like this: LED on, button pressed, LED off, Led on, LED off, LED on, stay on, stay on, LED off, Led on, LED off, LED on, stay on, stay on, forever. This is what I have:</p>  <pre><code>import RPi.GPIO as GPIO import time  def blink(pin):     GPIO.output(11, GPIO.LOW)     time.sleep(.2)     GPIO.output(11, GPIO.HIGH)     time.sleep(.2)     GPIO.output(11, GPIO.LOW)     time.sleep(.2)     GPIO.output(11, GPIO.HIGH)     time.sleep(.2)     GPIO.output(11, GPIO.LOW)     time.sleep(.2)     GPIO.output(11, GPIO.HIGH)     time.sleep(4)  def main():      GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BOARD)      GPIO.setup(11, GPIO.OUT)     GPIO.setup(16, GPIO.IN)      GPIO.output(11, GPIO.HIGH)      while True:         if GPIO.input(16):             blink(11)         else:             pass         time.sleep(.1)      GPIO.cleanup()  if __name__ == "__main__":     main() </code></pre>  <p>This seem to only make it blink right after the button is pressed, but not continually. Could you please help me? I'm extremely frustrated. Thanks!</p>
