<p>I dont know if this is possible on RBPI2, but i have :</p>  <p>A device that talks through a USB cable as a Virtual Com Port - i would like to connect that device to my RBP2 and be able to talk to it through this connection.</p>  <p>Q1) is it possible on RBP2 to set a USB port up and treat that as a serial port ?</p>  <p>Q2) would it be possible to make a sniffer setup where i would set 2 USB ports up to act as virtual com ports on RBPI2 - where as the data that comes IN on one USB port will be forwarded OUT on another USB port and vice veca ?</p>  <p>Regarding Q2 would enable me to make a sniffer what goes back and forth between 2 connected devices and inspect the protocol.</p>  <p>hope someone can help</p>
