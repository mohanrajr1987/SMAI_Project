<p>I am working on a game in Scratch based on Word puzzle. Player is given with set of alphabets on the screen and they have to make a word from it. I need to check first that the entered word is valid, for example: player entered 'wrok' but the valid word is 'Work'. </p>  <p>After the word is valid I want it to show on the Stage. Can anyone guide ? </p>  <p>I thought of using python script with Scratch, a variable can store the word entered by the player and it can be sent to python script and using python library enchant it can be checked. If the python returns True then it can be shown on the Stage.</p>  <p>I am not sure how to proceed or whether this procedure is correct.</p>  <p>Thank you</p>
