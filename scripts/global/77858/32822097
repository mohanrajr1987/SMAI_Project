<p>I tried to create a Java software to play a sound in fast forward. I noticed that the sound API of Java does not support this feature so I implemented it myself and it seemed to work quite well on my laptop. </p>  <p>But when I try to run it on my Raspberry Pi, I only get some strange sounds that seems to be in slow motion and and are really noisy although Raspberry Pi is capable to play a <code>javax.sound.sampled Clip</code>.</p>  <p>My question is in the context of playing a sound using the code from my previous question <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32724143/unsupported-control-type-sample-rate?noredirect=1#comment53291791_32724143">Unsupported control type: Sample Rate</a>. Am I doing something wrong in it that is loading heavily the Pi? Or simply the Pi is not capable of playing sound using the code I wrote?</p>
