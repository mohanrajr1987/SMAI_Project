<p>I want to set the Date and Time of a remote device (<em>Raspberry Pi 2 running Windows IoT</em>) to the value of the Date Time of a local device.</p>  <p>I create a variable $dateTime to hold the local DateTime. I assign a password to connect to  a remote device to a variable $password. I create a credential object. I connect to the remote device using Enter-PSSession. Now that I'm connected I try assigning the remote devices DateTime using Set-Date = $dateTime | Out-String.</p>  <p>I get <em>cannot convertvalue "=" to type "System.TimeSpan"</em> error.</p>  <pre><code>$dateTime = Get-Date $password = ConvertTo-SecureString "mypassword" -AsPlainText -Force $cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ("myremotedevice     \Administrator",$password) Enter-PSSession -ComputerName myremotedevice -Credential $cred Set-Date = $dateTime | Out-String </code></pre>  <p>It seems as if the $dateTime variable is out of scope once I am connected via the PSSession.  Is there a way around this ?</p>
