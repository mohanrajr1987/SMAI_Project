<p>This question is a continuation of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32614111/turning-off-auto-white-balance-on-raspberry-pi-webcam-in-simulink">this</a> one. Since nobody answered my question there, I tried to figure out a workaround, so I connected my PC with the Raspberry Pi by using the Cygwin64 Terminal, so I can change the parameters of my Raspberry Pi Webcam.</p>  <p>The connection was successful and then I tried to change the AWB parameter that is entirely described in the link above.</p>  <p>On the official site of Raspberry Pi, I found this <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/raspbian/applications/camera.md" rel="nofollow">link</a> in which they explain which programs control the Raspberry Pi camera and with what commands you can change the parameters of the camera.</p>  <p>When I try to add these commands: <code>sudo raspistill -awb off</code>, or <code>sudo raspivid -awb off</code>, or <code>sudo raspistillyuv -awb off</code>, I always get the following error: </p>  <p><code>mmal: mmal_vc_component_create: failed to create component 'vc.ril.camera' (1:ENOMEM) mmal: mmal_component_create_core: could not create component 'vc.ril.camera' (1) mmal: Failed to create camera component mmal: main: Failed to create camera component mmal: Camera is not enabled in this build. Try running "sudo raspi-config" and ensure that "camera" has been enabled </code>  </p>  <p>The thing is that I tried running <code>sudo raspi-config</code> and there I did enabled the camera, but still nothing changes. If I choose to reboot the Raspberry Pi after the changes have been made in the <code>raspi-config</code>, then everything starts from beginning. Which means, I need to download the Simulink program again and then the same error occurs.</p>  <p>I tried googling the error, but I have found nothing of interest, because people mostly get this kind of error when their camera is not working and the thing is that my camera <em>is</em> working, but when I try to change its parameters, the terminal says that it fails to create the camera component.</p>  <p>P.S. If I try the same commands when the Simulink program isn't on the Pi (when the camera is not active), there is a different error:</p>  <p><code>mmal: mmal_vc_component_create: failed to create component 'vc.ril.camera' (1:ENOMEM) mmal: mmal_component_create_core: could not create component 'vc.ril.camera' (1) mmal: Failed to create camera component mmal: main: Failed to create camera component mmal: Camera is not detected. Please check carefully the camera module is installed correctly</code></p>  <p>The last line means that the Raspberry Pi detects the camera, but still can't change its parameters.</p>  <p>Thanks for the help in advance,<br> Bojan</p>
