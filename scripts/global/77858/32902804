<p>I am actually real new into development and do not mind learning new stuff for the above project.   Here is what I want to do: I want to host a fast database server on a raspberry pi, which can be controlled after logging into a website (Online). The website should be able to read/write the data on the database. </p>  <p>I just need a few heads-up on how can i go ahead in doing this. I need the system to be fast enough when updating database from an external network.</p>
