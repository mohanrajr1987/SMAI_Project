<p>I bought a Raspberry Pi model B a while ago. I just noticed that although I am not running much things on it, it's heating up. It takes it about 10 minutes to heat up after being plugged in. Online people say that they have their Pi running 24/7 without heating. I am aware that the model B is a little out of date, is that why? Has it got anything to do with what I've used to plug it in? I'm using a cable specifically for the pi but the plug I'm using is separate. The only accessorie I have plugged in is a small speaker that gets its power from the pi. It is built specifically for it. I obviously have a wifi dongle and a keyboard, again all built specifically for the Pi. Any ideas? I've ordered some heat sinks for it and will probably buy a fan. I want to be able to run it 24/7 with only the occasional reboot. I plan on making some projects with it. </p>
