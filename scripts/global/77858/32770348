<p>I have a Logitech F710 which works GREAT in Linux (raspberry pi).</p>  <p><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0041RR0TW" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-940-000117-Gamepad-F710/dp/B0041RR0TW</a></p>  <p>I can receive all USB commands.</p>  <p>Now, I would like to be able to send back a vibration command to make the joystick force feedback come on. </p>  <p>I am using this lib: <a href="https://github.com/janpieper/node-joystick-logitech-f710" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/janpieper/node-joystick-logitech-f710</a></p>  <p>any idea how to do this? I am sure I would need to write back to the file descriptor, but what value and how to figure this out?</p>  <p>any help is appreciated</p>  <p>regards</p>  <p>Sean</p>
