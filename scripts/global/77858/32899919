<p>I am working with my Raspberry Pi 2 B+ and I am using Raspbian. I have a python script located at /home/pi/Desktop/control/gpio.py</p>  <p>When I type /home/pi/Desktop/control/gpio.py into the command line, I get the message bash: /home/pi/Desktop/control/gpio.py Permission denied</p>  <p>I have tried running sudo -s before running that command also but that doesnt work. My python script is using the Rpi.GPIO Library. </p>  <p>If someone could please explain why I am getting this error it would be appreciated! Thanks.</p>
