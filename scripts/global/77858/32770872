<p>I was trying to install my raspberry weather station. Now I tried a tutorial with the following code: <a href="http://pastebin.com/CEsymS3S" rel="nofollow">http://pastebin.com/CEsymS3S</a>.</p>  <p>But the problem is, that I will usually get a error message in my terminal (raspbian jessie), when I do the following command: ./fetch_wde_data.sh</p>  <p>./fetch_wde_data.sh: Line 15: syntax error <code>fi' ./fetch_wde_data.sh: Line 15:</code>   fi'</p>
