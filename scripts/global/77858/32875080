<p>Hi i am new to python and raspberry pi and i am coding for raspberry pi 2 in python and i am making a time which resets itself if push button was pressed for more than 5 seconds for which  i want to detect for how long the push button was pressed.I have found a C code for arduino that detects the time for which push button was pressed but don't know how to implement it in python for raspberry pi</p>  <pre><code>  const int buttonPin = 2;     int buttonState = 0;     // current state of the button   int lastButtonState = 0; // previous state of the button   int startPressed = 0;    // the time button was pressed   int endPressed = 0;      // the time button was released   int timeHold = 0;        // the time button is hold   int timeReleased = 0;    // the time button is released  void setup() {   // initialize the button pin as a input:   pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT);   // initialize serial communication:   Serial.begin(9600);  }   void loop() {   // read the pushbutton input pin:  buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);   // button state changed if (buttonState != lastButtonState) {    // the button was just pressed   if (buttonState == HIGH) {       startPressed = milis();       timeReleased = startPressed - endPressed;        if (timeReleased &gt;= 500 &amp;&amp; timeReleased &lt; 1000) {           Serial.println("Button idle for half a second");        }        if (timeReleased &gt;= 1000) {           Serial.println("Button idle for one second or more");        }    // the button was just released   } else {       endPressed = milis();       timeHold = endPressed - startPressed;        if (timeHold &gt;= 500 &amp;&amp; timeHold &lt; 1000) {           Serial.println("Button hold for half a second");        }        if (timeHold &gt;= 1000) {           Serial.println("Button hold for one second or more");        }    }   }     // save the current state as the last state,     //for next time through the loop    lastButtonState = buttonState;   } </code></pre>
