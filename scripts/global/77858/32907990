<p>I'm looking for a python module to which allows me to handle events. These events may be triggered by</p>  <ul> <li>timers</li> <li>i2c input (e.g. buttons)</li> </ul>  <p>I'm building a <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/wordclock/" rel="nofollow">wordclock</a> (with the bibliopixel module) and would like to display the time in a main loop. On the RPI, I've got a temperature and humidity sensor installed. So, I need to suspend the main loop and scroll text (or display any other animation). This could be triggered by a timer or i2c input. After that I'd like to jump back to the loop.</p>  <p><em>What is the 'standard' module for such tasks? There are tons of modules, but finding the best one is difficult for me as I'm not precisely sure, what features I need...</em></p>  <p>Regards, Achim</p>
