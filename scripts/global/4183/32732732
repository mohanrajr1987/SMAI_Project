<p>I'm using a class which extends a <code>JDialog</code>. In the constructor I'm adding two text fields whose value is read from a properties file and a login button. But the problem is when I run the application the <code>JDialog</code> should automatically <code>setFocus()</code> on the first text field but its not happening until I manually click on the box which is appearing.</p>  <p>How can I achieve that?  I've searched through many links and tried many things like <code>setFocus()</code>,<code>requestFocusInWindow()</code>,etc but nothing is working out.</p>
