<p>I'm having an issue on Safari in iOS 8:</p>  <p>In my web page I have a regular form on the bottom of the page (I need to scroll down). If I focus on one textfield, I can write what I want and press '>' (TAB) in the keyboard to go to the next form element. However, if I press 'Done' in the keyboard, the page scrolls all the way to the top. </p>  <p>This only happens with iOS 8. Maybe related: everytime I focus on a form element, there's a slight scroll up and down before showing the keyboard. I've read that there are some focus issues with iOS 8. Is it possible to prevent the scrolling of the page after the keyboard closes?</p>
