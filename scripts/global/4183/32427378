<p>I have this simple GUI app:</p>  <pre><code>from tkinter import *  def Key(event):     print(event.char)  root = Tk()  btn1 = Button(root, text='Button1') btn1.pack(side=LEFT) btn1.bind('&lt;Key&gt;', Key)  btn2 = Button(root, text='Button2') btn2.pack(side=LEFT) btn2.bind('&lt;Key&gt;', Key)  root.mainloop() </code></pre>  <p>I would expect buttons to receive focus and start accepting <code>KeyPress</code> events when I click on them, as well as they should display a dotted line box indicating being in focus, but that does not happen. I have to use <code>Tab</code> to move focus.</p>  <p>Is this the expected behavior and why?</p>  <p>I know I can put focus on a widget programmatically. My question is only about why clicking on a button will not put focus on it.</p>
