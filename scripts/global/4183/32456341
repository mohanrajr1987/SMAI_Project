<p>I´ve created a Qt-Quick Combo-Box that, when it will be pressed, opens a QWindow, in which I show the content within a TableView. The problem is, the focus on the TableView can´t be set. </p>  <p>So first question is: How can I set the Focus on my TableView (which is hosted inside my QWindow)?</p>  <p>Furthermore, I have to get the event, if the user clicks beside the QWindow or outside the Application. That means the focus was changed and I can close my QWindow.</p>  <p>So second question is: How can I get the information, that the TableView lost the focus?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
