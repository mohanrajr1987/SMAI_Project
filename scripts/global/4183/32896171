<p>Wondering how should I access elements property which does have the focus. I have found the following code to find the focused element :</p>  <pre><code>var focusedControl = FocusManager.GetFocusedElement(this); </code></pre>  <p>This seems to work well, in debug "focusedcontrol" is the right element however I don't know how to access it programmatically. Something like :</p>  <pre><code>focusedControl.Text = "txt"; </code></pre>  <p>The reason why I wanna do this - in the same window as the TextBoxes I have several Buttons which form a keypad. After hitting the Button (Focusable = False) I want to get reference to focused TextBox and insert the corresponding digit in TextBox.Text.</p>  <p>Thanks Lukas</p>
