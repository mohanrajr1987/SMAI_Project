<p>I have simplified a test for the <code>:focus</code> pseudo class. Here is the HTML:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;span id="test" tabindex="1"&gt;Hello&lt;/span&gt; </code></pre>  <p>and the CSS:</p>  <pre><code>span#test:focus {     color: red; } </code></pre>  <p>When I click on the span on the desktop, it works as expected (changes the colour to red). However, when I touch it on my iPhone, it doesn’t.</p>  <p>I can get it to work if the <code>:focus</code> is changed to <code>:hover</code>, but I don’t want that for the desktop version, since I want it to wait until until the user clicks.</p>  <p>I may have to resort to JavaScript, but is there a CSS solution to this?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
