<p>I have written a custom wpf usercontrol which subscribes the <code>LostFocus</code> event. But i have the problem, that the event also gets fired if the <code>UserControl</code> has focus and the window which contains the control will be closed. I don't want to get the event fired if the window is closing, only if the user select antoher control with the mouse or tab through the ui elements.</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>  <p>As an important information, i do not have access to the <code>Window</code> instance in the user control.</p>  <p><strong>EDIT 2</strong></p>  <p>It would be nice if there is a solution which not only work for window closing, as also for closeable TabItems and all similiar things. In general if we could say, if the <code>UserControl</code> visibility will be change to not visible.</p>  <p>Thank you very much.</p>
