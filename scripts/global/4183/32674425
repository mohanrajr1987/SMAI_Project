<p>In my Java application I have JFrame and I wanted to use ALT for other purposes but when pressed it automatically focuses the first item in the assigned JMenuBar.</p>  <p>Now after some googling I found out that it is caused by Look&amp;Feel that I set to System Look&amp;Feel (which is the one for Windows). I found that <strong>F10 key</strong> is by '<strong>MenuBar.windowBindings</strong>' key in UIManager class bound to do the same thing and I was able to disable that by rewriting that key but I can't seem to find a source of ALT being set this way. Now, I went through <a href="http://www.alethis.net/reference/java/uidefaults.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> list to see whether I could find the source of the binding but without any luck.</p>  <p>Is there a key in UIManager properties that I've missed or does it have completely different solution?</p>  <p>Example code:</p>  <pre><code>import javax.swing.JFrame; import javax.swing.JMenuBar; import javax.swing.JMenu; import javax.swing.UIManager;  public class MyFrame extends JFrame {     private JMenuBar menuBar;    private JMenu fileMenu;     public MyFrame() {        try {            UIManager.setLookAndFeel(UIManager.getSystemLookAndFeelClassName());        } catch(Exception ex) {}         menuBar = new JMenuBar();        fileMenu = new JMenu("File");        menuBar.add(fileMenu);       setJMenuBar(menuBar);        setSize(300,300);       setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);    }     public static void main(String[] args) {       MyFrame frame = new MyFrame();       frame.setVisible(true);    } } </code></pre>  <p>Thanks!</p>
