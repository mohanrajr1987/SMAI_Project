<p>A button in a website triggers a popup menu when clicked (only when clicked, and not when hovered over). I want to be able to inspect this popup menu but after I right click it and select "Inspect Element", it disappears so I can no longer inspect it.</p>  <p>When the popup menu is displayed, I can see that an entry for it appears in the HTML in the Inspector tab but when I click the entry, the popup menu disappears an so does the HTML entry. </p>  <p>For cases in which a menu appears when a button is hovered over (not clicked) I would click an entry in the Inspector tab to switch focus to it, then I would just hover over the button and use the arrow keys to navigate to the entry in the Inspector tab. But since this button needs to be clicked, then I lose the focus on the Inspector tab.</p>  <p>I thought this could be solved by switching the focus to the Inspector tab in Firefox's Web Tools without clicking anything.</p>  <p>I've tried using different shortcuts such as Ctrl+Shift+C or Ctrl+Shift+I (opens the Web Tool) but I haven't been able to switch the focus to the the Inspector tab to navigate through the HTML after using these shortcuts.</p>  <p>I've also tried using inspect mode (the button left of the Inspector tab), which lets me inspect anything I click. The problem with this method is that to get to the menu I need to click a button first and inspect mode only inspect the first thing I click. Maybe there's a way to ignore the first click while on inspect mode?</p>  <p>EDIT:<br> Pressing the TAB key numerous times, sometimes focuses on the Inspector tab. Sometimes it just loops through the elements in the website and never focuses on the Inspector tab. Even so, the times I was able to use TAB to focus on the Inspector tab, the popup menu disappeared after pressing TAB about 20 times so I need a different method that doesn't use the TAB key.</p>
