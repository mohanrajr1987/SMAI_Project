<p>I have placed a sticky form in right side of my website. It work perfectly when i rollover and rollout. but when i try to fill the form it roll back to side wall. some blur and focus script need to be placed and I am unable to figure it out. following is the image and code.</p>  <pre><code>$('.sticky').hover(function(){     $('.sticky').css('right', 0+'px')}, function(){     $('.sticky').css('right', -320+'px'); }); </code></pre>  <p>my form id is sticky-form. Please advice or guide, all i want is to for stay there if any of its field is blur/focus and if not then it can roll back to the wall. thanks</p>
