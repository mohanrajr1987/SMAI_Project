<p>I have a windows application where I have a date that when it is changed there is a lot of other things going on or have to be confirmed. So my goal is to have a wizard popup when they select the date to walk the user through the process. I don't want them to be able to change the date on the main form at all. I'll update it through the wizard.</p>  <p>Currently I'm calling the wizard on <code>Enter</code> of the <code>DateTimePicker</code>. I'm open to changing that if there is a better option but they have to actually select the field not just hover over it. The problem I have is that when the wizard closes, the focus/cursor is still sitting in the date field where the user could potentially change the date. I know I can check the <code>KeyPress</code> or on <code>MouseDown</code> to relaunch the wizard, but what I would RATHER do is just move the cursor to another control. </p>  <p>I tried <code>NewControl.Focus()</code> and this appears to work, however there are 2 problems with it. </p>  <ol> <li>According to MSDN, I should not be trying to change the focus with an Enter event. If COULD cause the application or OS to stop responding. </li> <li>When I cancel the wizard it Enters the control a second time triggering the popup and when it is cancelled a second time it leaves the calendar open or part of the date highlighted (depending on who the user entered the field).</li> </ol>  <p>I'm open to all suggestions for a better way to do this. </p>
