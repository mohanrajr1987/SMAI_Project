<p>I have two Grids (both in its own panel), and want to navigate between them using the Tab Key.</p>  <p>To do that I'm trying to focus the Grid inside a Panel (If Tab is pressed, the Grid should gain focus, so I can use the up/Down key to select Items).</p>  <p>Vaadin doesn't provide a .focus() method for Grid. Is there any solution so i can focus the Grid anyway?</p>  <p><strong>Edit: Solved the problem using Javascript/Jquery. Added this to my Panel that contains the Grid:</strong></p>  <pre><code>public class FileTable extends Panel    {     String id;    public FileTable(String id)    {     this.id=id;     Grid table = new Grid();     initGrid();     fileTable.setId(id);    }     public void focus()    {      JavaScript.getCurrent().execute("$(\"#"+id+" table:first td:first\").click();");    } } </code></pre>  <p>Thanks for Helping</p>
