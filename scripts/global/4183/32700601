<p>I have a custom <code>UICollectionViewCell</code> in my tvOS app. It has a <code>UIImageView</code> and some <code>UILabel</code>s in it. I can get the cell to be focused by implementing the <code>UIFocusEnvironment</code> protocol without any issue, but I can't figure out how to give my custom cell the focused appearance. (Elevation and responding to user movement on the touchpad). </p>  <p>I'm aware of <code>UIImageView</code>'s <code>adjustsImageWhenAncestorFocused</code> property, but that only elevates the image in my cell, not the entire cell.</p>  <p>Is there a way to make tvOS apply the (seemingly) standard focus appearance/behavior to my custom view or do I have to do it all manually?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
