<p>I am currently having a problem with fullpage.js scrolling after opening an overlay div and closing it again. (via jQuery, fadeIn and fadeOut)</p>  <p>The overlay div's code is outside of the </p>  <pre><code>&lt;div id="fullpage"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>-stuff. How can I set the focus on the fullpage content again, so I don't have to click/touch on e.g. its background again, to "reactivate" its scrolling ability?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
