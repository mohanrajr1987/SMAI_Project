<p>I am trying to generate a video clip of a single image and add a silent audio track for concatenating with other video files.<br> I can successfully create the mp4 video with the desired image and audio track BUT, according to mediaInfo, the length of the video stream and the length of the audio stream are different.  They are off by up to 60 ms.  As I plan to concatenate several of these image clips and other video clips, I don't want the error to accumulate.  Any thoughts or suggestions for maintaining perfect video/audio sync?</p>  <p>Here are the ffmpeg commands that I am using:</p>  <p>C:\FFmpeg\bin\ffmpeg.exe -loop 1 -i myImage.jpg -codec:v libx264 -t 7 -profile:v high -preset slow -r 25 -b:v 500k -maxrate 500k -vf scale=1280:720 -y videoStreamOnly.mp4</p>  <p>C:\FFmpeg\bin\ffmpeg.exe -f lavfi -i anullsrc=r=48000 -i videoStreamOnly.mp4 -shortest -c:v copy -c:a aac -strict experimental -y videoWithSilentAudioStream.mp4</p>
