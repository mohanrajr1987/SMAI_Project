<p>I have a couple of questions regarding sync between servers. I am planning to set up a failover/ redundancy server architecture using keepalived for Linux. The architecture would be similar to this.  <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/MQqvM.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/MQqvM.png" alt="keepalived failover network architecture"></a> As we all know failover/redundancy servers needs to be synchronised to have consistent data across all the servers. One of the site recommended to run rsync to sync data between master(LB1) and secondary(LB2) servers periodically. At the worst case consistent data may not be available on a particular server at that point of time when sync hasn't happened yet. So I was wondering is it possible to feed data from the firewall itself to multiple systems in parallel so that there is no need for any sync? Kindly let me know.</p>
