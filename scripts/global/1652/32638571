<p>I have an issues with a threading exercise in school, we are just learning about threads/sychronization and I am a bit lost.</p>  <p>Basically I want to start 4 threads of a certain class. Each thread will run 25 times and print out numbers 1---100.</p>  <p>This is what the output should look something like</p>  <p>thread 1: 1</p>  <p>Thread 3: 2</p>  <p>Thread 4: 3</p>  <p>Thread 2: 4</p>  <p>.</p>  <p>.</p>  <p>.</p>  <p>.</p>  <p>Thread 3: 100</p>  <p>But what actually gets printed out is something like this. It counts but the numbers are not correctly spitted out.</p>  <p>thread 1: 1</p>  <p>Thread 3: 1</p>  <p>Thread 4: 5</p>  <p>Thread 2: 6</p>  <p>Thread 3: 7</p>  <p>Thread 3: 8</p>  <p>Thread 1: 9</p>  <p>Thread 2: 10</p>  <p>Thread 4: 10</p>  <p>.</p>  <p>.</p>  <p>.</p>  <p>.</p>  <p>Thread 3: 100</p>  <p>this is my code for the class that is being threaded</p>  <pre><code>public class numberentrycreater implements Runnable {     final private int max = 100;     private static int count = 1;     private String createdBy;     private SharedBuffer buffer;      public numberentrycreater(String createdBy ){         this.createdBy = createdBy;     }      public synchronized void  increment(NumberEntry ne){         System.out.println(ne.getCreatedBy()+": " + ne.getValue());         if(count&lt;=max){             count++;         }     }      @Override     public  void run()     {         for(int i=0; i&lt;25; i++){             if(count&lt;=max){                 NumberEntry ne = new NumberEntry(count,createdBy);                 increment(ne);                 try                 {                     Thread.sleep(100);                 } catch (InterruptedException e)                 {                     // TODO Auto-generated catch block                     e.printStackTrace();                 }             }         }     } } </code></pre>  <p>I believe the issue lies in the creation of the NumberEntry Object. But I'm not quite sure how to fix it. If anyone could help me out in any way that would be great :).</p>
