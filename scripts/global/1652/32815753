<p>There are two threads where one will insert into the map and the other will <code>find</code> from the map. </p>  <pre><code>map&lt;string,object&gt;* mapA; </code></pre>  <p>If thread A will insert the configuration object into the Map w.r.t the string key. </p>  <p>Where the thread B will try to find with the same string key. If not present it will try again until the string key is found by it. </p>  <p>Will it cause a crash or data corruption in the process , if thread A inserts at the same time when thread B is read the key ? Is there synchronization needed here?</p>  <p><em>While testing with a sample application i dint face any type of crash or corruption</em></p>
