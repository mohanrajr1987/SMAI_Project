<p>I am trying using <a href="https://launchpad.net/mysql-replication-listener" rel="nofollow">MySQL Replication Listener Library</a> to do data replication between HostA and HostB. </p>  <p>Basiclly it's just like doing row-based replication, but by myself other than mysql. Reading all row changes from HostA's bin log and applying all these changes to HostB.</p>  <p>The issue I am encountering is, I am not able to disable triggers temporarily, which causes the data to be out of sync.</p>  <p>Take an example, suppose the database to be synchronized is TestSyncDB, and there are two tables in it which are Data and DataOp. The Data table has a trigger with it and once a record is inserted into this table, the trigger will generate a new record to the DataOp. </p>  <p>Now a new record is inserted into HostA.TestSyncDB.Data, since there is a trigger, so there will actually be two records adding to the tables, and the Replication Listener Library will return to me two queries, something like:</p>  <ol> <li>insert into HostA.TestSyncDB.Data   values (...)         </li> <li>insert into HostA.TestSyncDB.DataOp values (...)  // by trigger</li> </ol>  <p>The problem is if I replay these two queries to HostB, there will be three new records added to tables in HostA.TestSyncDB, because of the triggers. Then data is never right ever after.</p>  <p>So how to solve this? Is is possible to disable triggers temporarily? If not, how to do it correctly like what MySQL Replication does?</p>
