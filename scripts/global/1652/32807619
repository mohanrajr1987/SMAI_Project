<p>I have nodejs server application. I have this line of code for my logging:  </p>  <p>fs.writeFileSync(__dirname + "/../../logs/download.html.xml", doc.toString());</p>  <p>Sometimes it works correctly, but under heavy load sometimes gives this exception:</p>  <p>Error: UNKNOWN, unknown error 'download.html.xml'</p>  <p>PS: I've found a link here: <a href="http://www.daveeddy.com/2013/03/26/synchronous-file-io-in-nodejs/" rel="nofollow">http://www.daveeddy.com/2013/03/26/synchronous-file-io-in-nodejs/</a> Blogger describes that writeFileSync doesn't really finish writing on return. Is there any correct way to do it in a sync way, i.e. without callbacks?</p>
