<p>I want to design a business application for a windows tablet. The app's database should be in sync with a cloud server.[Azure/AWS]. But the app should run perfectly without internet connection. The data should get synced to server when connection in on. And the sync should be two way also. </p>  <p>Till now I have come across this solution  <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/documentation/articles/mobile-services-windows-store-dotnet-get-started-offline-data/" rel="nofollow">Using Offline Data With Azure Mobile Services</a> </p>  <p>But I want to know </p>  <ul> <li>How much data can I save in my sqlitelocalstore. Is this same as much as sqlite supports.? [to be precise can I use this to store 5GB data locally for a LOB app].</li> <li>Is there a way to sync few columns of a table to server?</li> <li>Can I support few Database transactions in my client code?</li> </ul>  <p>Is there any better way to solve the above problem. </p>
