<p>I have recently discovered that you can connect the <strong>Eclipse Task List</strong> with GitHub directly thus allowing a nice synchronization between a selected repository and what your are doing in the IDE related to that repository (task-wise). I'm using <strong>Eclipse Mars 4.5.0</strong>.</p>  <p>I have created a GitHub Task Query (you can see my settings below):</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/qaNd3.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/qaNd3.png" alt="GitHub task query settings"></a></p>  <p>At first I was able to create two issues that also appeared on GitHub. Both issue were however placed in a folder (in the Task List interface) saying <strong>Unmatched (Automatic container for repository tasks not matched by any query</strong>. Weird...But since today things got even worse - all tasks I create are placed in the <strong>Unsubmitted</strong> folder. This makes perfect sense with one exception - whenever I try to submit the task I get:</p>  <blockquote>   <blockquote>     <p>Submit failed: Unexpected error: Requires authentification</p>   </blockquote> </blockquote>  <p>So basically after two tasks I can no longer even submit anything. Upon creating a task I make sure I select the task query I have selected for my repository. Also the idea of all this task synchronization is supposed to be bidirectional right? When I create a task in the <strong>Eclipse Task List</strong> I expect that it will be displayed on the repositories <strong>Issues page on GitHub</strong> and the other way around - when someone creates an issue on that same page it should appear in my task list. This is at least my understanding of synchronization. The task query doesn't show any issue whatsoever. Validating it returns that everything is perfectly fine. Pressing on the synchronization button (even though I have enabled automatic synchronization) also doesn't return any errors.</p>  <p>Am I missing something or this is one of the buggiest plugins for Eclipse?</p>
