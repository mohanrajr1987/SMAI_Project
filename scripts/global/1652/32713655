<p>I am looking to solve the problem that is: <code>Synchronizing data</code> between <code>Local Database</code> to <code>Remote Database</code> whenever the system is connected with the <code>Internet</code>. I have searched a lot and found that <code>Configure Data Synchronization Dialog Box</code> is used for this purpose that can be opened through adding <code>Local Database Cache Template</code> to the Project, But i can't see this Template in visual Studio while adding to my <code>WPF C# Project</code> (Visual Studio 2013).I am using SQL Server 2012. Can any one help me to tackle this problem, that how can i efficiently do the <code>Synchronization</code> of data from local Database to Remote Database whenever system Detects Internet connection..Thanks! in advance.</p>
