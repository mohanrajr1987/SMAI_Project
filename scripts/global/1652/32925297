<p>I have a Cordova(ionic) application which using SQLite plugin as local database. Our web service is connected to MS SQL server. When user have no internet connection he should be able to add data into local DB(SQLite), then when he/she is connected to internet user need to sync to web DB(MS SQL Server). </p>  <p>There are 7 tables with large amount of data(~10000 rows per table). I need 100% reliability on data. Without dropping any data.</p>  <p>Is there any algorithm or feature to do this thing? </p>  <p>Which one is better in mobile? IndexedDB or SQLite.</p>
