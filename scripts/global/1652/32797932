<p>I will make a hypothetical scenario just to be clear about what I need to know.</p>  <p>Let's say I have a single file being updated very often.</p>  <p>I need to read and parse this file by several different threads.</p>  <p>Everytime this file is rewritten, I'm gonna wake a condition mutex so the other threads can do whatever they want to.</p>  <p>My question is:</p>  <p>If I have 10000 threads, the first thread execution will block the execution of the other 9999 ones?</p>  <p>Does it work in parallel or synchronously?</p>
