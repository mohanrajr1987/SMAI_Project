<p>i just wonder how much time does android phones or tablets need to sync with NITZ?</p>  <p>From settings in the phone, there is a date-time setting.<br> and from "automate to decide to date and time" setting in it, there are 3 options in my phone: 1. Using Time Provided by Network 2. Using Time Provided by GPS 3. Close the first option means syncing with NITZ as the provider is China Mobile. So in my project, i need know the exact time interval of syncing NiTZ with my phone.</p>  <p>Moreover, if you can ask me the question: By what means does the phone sync with NITZ? GSM? CDMA? WIFI?</p>  <p>your answers would be great appreciated!</p>
