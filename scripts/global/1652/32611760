<p>I am making an app (in Swift) which needs to run in offline and online mode. When its in offline mode, data will be stored locally on CoreData. Once it detects network (online) it should sync with server and update the backend database. How should one go about it. Are there libraries or pods?</p>  <p>I have seen <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9985341/sync-core-data-with-web-server">this post</a> but nothing is actionable. It is too high level and I am not sure where to start. I have seen this link from <a href="http://www.raywenderlich.com/15916/how-to-synchronize-core-data-with-a-web-service-part-1" rel="nofollow">Ray Wenderlich</a> but don't know how to translate to Swift. </p>  <p>Any tutorial links will also be helpful</p>
