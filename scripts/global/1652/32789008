<p>While accessing/ updating a variable via multiple  threads  for eg A Bank class having class variable Double balance; The above Bank class is similar to Joint Bank account of 5 customers. 5 customers of Bank are similary to 5 Threads of class Bank which are updating every time the value of double balance. As at any time any thread say T1 can come and read value of Balance. Which may be updated by T2 soon after T1 execute Reading, so T1 has read  previous values not the latest. How will the ACID property will be maintained. Like how balance can be consistent for every thread. I know that we have locking mechanism Synchronized , however I am not cleared with its real implementation Please clear it with example.</p>
