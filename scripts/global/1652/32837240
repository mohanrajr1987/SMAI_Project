<p>I have a <code>WPF Project</code> developed in <code>C#</code>. My task is to <code>synchronize</code> data from <code>Local Database</code> to <code>remote Database</code> whenever the system is connected to the <code>internet</code>.I am searching on this from a week and found that it can be resolved by adding <code>Local Database Cache Template</code> but it is <code>removed</code> from <code>Visual Studio 2013</code> by <code>Microsoft</code> so i am stuck at this problem and couldn't get any kind of help from <code>StackOverflow</code>. Is there any body who knows about this problem and help me to get through this problems ? I will highly <code>appreciate</code> the help provided by you guys.. </p>
