<p>I have two projects I have to use git-ftp with to keep my local repo in sync with the FTP server.  I'm trying to figure out how to compare my local repository to the files on the FTP server.  </p>  <p>Obviously I could just use a FTP application like FileZilla to look at the two for differences, but I'm trying to do both these projects purely with Git and Git-ftp.</p>  <p>I can't seem to find a command to do this, and maybe there isn't one.  Can anyone point me in the right direction or confirm/deny this is possible?</p>  <p>All always, thanks to everyone in advance for your sage advice and wisdom!</p>
