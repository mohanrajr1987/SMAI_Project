<p>I am using jQuery to create a somewhat interactive eBay listing, and so of course I am using the probably well known method to load jQuery into eBay. While I have tested the result across many browsers, it has become obvious that some users of iPhones seem to have an issue with certain interactive elements of the HTML/javascript.</p>  <p>I believe I have narrowed this down to older iPhone 4s and below, more specifically iOS 4.</p>  <p>Following further testing I think it seems like there is just something wrong with the way this OS or potentially just the iPhone browser processes javascript. The first issue I noticed was that onclick events were not working when I defined them as follows:</p>  <pre><code>  $('.divs').on('click',function(e) {     //stuff   }); </code></pre>  <p>This seems to be fixable by simply making the entire function inline, ie, <code>onclick="javascript: etc</code>, it's not particularly pretty but it seems to work.</p>  <p>The second issue, and this is one that I haven't been able to figure a way around so far, is that using a loading script of the following format just doesn't seem to work:</p>  <pre><code>    &lt;script async type="text/javascript"&gt;         var resource = document.createElement("script");         resource.src = "http://..../jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js";         var script = document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];         script.parentNode.insertBefore(resource, script);     &lt;/script&gt; </code></pre>  <p>So from what I can tell there is some part of the above script that iPhone iOS4 browser just doesn't like. I would rather not try to rewrite the entire page to not use any externally loaded scripts, and I am not even sure it's possible for the interactivity I want to achieve, so any help would be much appreciated.</p>
