<p>Can we replace contacts name from native application? For example a record is already saved in contact with name "abc" and i have to change it with name "xyz". Now record should be replaced with name "xyz" in address book. Please give me any small hint so that i can start work on it. Help would be appropriated in advance. Thank you very much. </p>
