<p>I have a program where I save an int value as follows:</p>  <pre><code>client.oldId = [clientDict objectForKey:@"oldId"]; </code></pre>  <p>At this point when debugging the value that is saved "supposely" is 31.</p>  <p>When I attempt to retrieve this item using the context, and i retrieve it as follows:</p>  <pre><code> int oldId = [NSNumber numberWithInt:client.oldId]; </code></pre>  <p>It becomes 174806944, why could this happen?, there are no summation operations or anything like that for this item and right before it saves to the context it is 31.</p>  <p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
