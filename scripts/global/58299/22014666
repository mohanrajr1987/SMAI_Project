<p>I am doing two operations on a textfield: 1) To move the textfield using pan gesture. 2) To write on the textfield when the user clicks on it. Concern is that I want to perform one operation at a time i.e when the user is writing he cannot scroll and vice versa.</p>  <p>Name of UIButton action --- button Name of UIButton outlet --- optionButton</p>  <pre><code>- (IBAction)button:(id)sender {     if([_optionButton.titleLabel.text isEqualToString:@"SCROLL"])     {         NSLog(@"can scroll");         NSLog(@"POINT=============%d   ",point);         point=0;         [_optionButton setTitle:@"WRITE" forState:UIControlStateNormal];         textField1.enabled=NO;     }     else     {        NSLog(@"can write");         NSLog(@"POINT=============%d   ",point);         point=1;         [_optionButton setTitle:@"SCROLL" forState:UIControlStateNormal];         textField1.enabled=YES;     } } </code></pre>  <p>The point variable is controlling the complete operation and is set to 1 at the beginning.This means that the user can write in the beginning and if he want to write he has to press the button. The problem that I am facing is that by using "<strong>textField1.enabled=NO</strong>" I am not able to scroll the textfield. Is there any function using which I can remove the focus from the textfield but can scroll it.</p>
