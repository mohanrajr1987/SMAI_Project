<p>I am working on searchbar customization. I googled it, and I did not find an answer to my problem.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/NVt5P.png" alt="Search your Match"></p>  <p>I used the following code to change background image:</p>  <pre><code> searchBar.backgroundColor=[UIColor clearColor];  [[UISearchBar appearance] setSearchFieldBackgroundImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"search-.png"] forState:UIControlStateNormal];   [[UISearchBar appearance] setImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"search-magnifier"] forSearchBarIcon:UISearchBarIconSearch state:UIControlStateNormal]; </code></pre>  <p>I already used the code for getting subviews of searchbar, but it did not help. Does anyone have any suggestions?</p>
