<p>As I am a newbie in iOS development, I wanted to know if I can compress a video file of size more than 100 MB which is in the camera roll in my application? I have no idea about these details since I am new to this field. Few sources say that our application crashes if the size of a video exceeds 100 MB. And I could not find any relevant solution for this question. Please help me with proper details about this issue. </p>
