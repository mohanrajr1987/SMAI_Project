<p>I'm learning iPhone app development.</p>  <p>For backward compatibility testing purposes I'm keeping an old iPhone on iOS 4. It's on iOS 4.2, but a lot of reasons (especially Corona) are pushing me to bring it up just a little, to iOS 4.3. It's a Verizon iPhone 4. Looking on iClarified, I can't find a version of iOS 4.3 that will install to my phone. Like it's missing or something.</p>  <p>Anybody out there understand this list, to know whether it's missing or what version I should be downloading?</p>
