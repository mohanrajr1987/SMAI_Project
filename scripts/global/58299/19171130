<p>I find it hard to locate some kind of information source which will give me a breakdown of the most used iOS versions as of today. I am working on my app and trying to decide on my "Deployment Target". I want to choose iOS 5.0 but not sure how many iOS 4.x users are out there. Does anyone know of a good place to get this information?</p>
