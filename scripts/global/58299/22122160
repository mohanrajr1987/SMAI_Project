<p>I am trying to get 'luke' to jump over an object to ensure that the game does not end, which he does but even if he avoids the object the game still ends, as if luke had not left his original location during the animation. </p>  <p>I used the UIView animateWithDuration in <code>-(void)touchesBegin</code> to try to achieve this. </p>  <pre><code>[UIView animateWithDuration:3                  animations:^  {      luke.center = CGPointMake(luke.center.x +0, luke.center.y -60);  }                  completion:^(BOOL completed)  {      if (completed)      {          [UIView animateWithDuration:3                      animations:^                {               luke.center = CGPointMake(luke.center.x +0, luke.center.y +60);           }];      } </code></pre>  <p>I am also using <code>CGRectIntersectsRect</code> to tell me when the two objects collide</p>  <pre><code>-(void)collision {  if (CGRectIntersectsRect(luke.frame, smallboulder.frame)) {     [self endgame]; }  if (CGRectIntersectsRect(luke.frame, largeboulder.frame)) {     [self endgame];  }  if (CGRectIntersectsRect(luke.frame, cactus.frame)) {     [self endgame]; }    </code></pre>  <p>finally can i use an animation set up as a <code>NSArray</code> to show movement when jumping.</p>  <p>Many thanks</p>  <p>JP</p>
