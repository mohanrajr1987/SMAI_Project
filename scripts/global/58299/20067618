<p>I want to develop iOS static library and distribute to other developers.</p>  <p>I have started some R&amp;D and found only one way to create static library with only one class which is having header file and implementation file.</p>  <p>I would like to create static library with more individual classes. Now we are creating static libraries with only header files and implementation files.</p>  <p>Is it possible to add XIB files also to that? Can anyone guide me to solve this requirement?</p>
