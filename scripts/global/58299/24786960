<p>I'm not too familiar with Iphone development, but I am trying to create an App that can lock the screen and prevent the user from using the phone under certain conditions.</p>  <p>I have been told before that it is impossible for this type of functionality to exist in an Iphone, but I know there is an app called Cell Control that does something similar.  I am trying to figure out how to create this type of functionality.</p>  <p>My research has led me to MDM solutions that was introduced in IOS4.  This link was very helpful: <a href="http://flicksoftware.com/2010/08/mobile-it-guide-to-iphone-deployment-and-management-with-apples-ios-4/" rel="nofollow">http://flicksoftware.com/2010/08/mobile-it-guide-to-iphone-deployment-and-management-with-apples-ios-4/</a></p>  <p>My question is how would one go about implementing a lock screen functionality in an Iphone app.  Is it using some implementation of the MDM solution, or doing something else entirely?</p>
