<p>I am trying to use UIbezierPaths for the first time and I am having no success in displaying it in the view. I am using a very old version of xcode (3.2.6).</p>  <pre><code>-(void)drawshape:(CGRect)Rect {    UIBezierPath *cloudpath = [UIBezierPath bezierPath];    [cloudpath moveToPoint:CGPointMake(100.0, 100.0)];    [cloudpath addLineToPoint:CGPointMake(200, 200)];   [cloudpath addLineToPoint:CGPointMake(200, 300)];   [cloudpath addLineToPoint:CGPointMake(250, 330)];   [cloudpath addLineToPoint:CGPointMake(20, 400)];   [cloudpath closePath];    cloudpath.lineWidth = 2;   [[UIColor blueColor]setStroke];    [cloudpath stroke];  } </code></pre>  <p>I have also Imported QuartzCore. I have only added -(void)drawshape in viewcontroller.h</p>  <p>When I build, i have no errors.Any help is massively welcomed</p>
