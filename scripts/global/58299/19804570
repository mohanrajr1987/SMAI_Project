<h2>Update - Example</h2>  <p>The UIScrollView property in UIWebView is available for iOS 5 or later. I find this out by searching Apple's developer site for all of my UI element class one by one.</p>  <p>Things like this, is there a full collection for iOS 5 features?</p>  <h2>Original Post</h2>  <p>Such as which method of UIView is only available in iOS 5 or later.</p>  <p>I can't find out the problem why my app can't run on iOS 4.3 device but runs on iOS 5 or later.</p>  <p>Thank you!</p>  <p>If there are many new features iOS 5, how can I find it all in one place instead of reading Apple's website page by page? </p>
