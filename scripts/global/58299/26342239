<p>I have an iOS 4 app I developed 4 years ago that needs to run all iOS versions from 4 to 8.  What is the best way to go about that.  All I can think of is just go through all compiler failures and fix them while if I use any feature not present in iOS 4 I have to to do if else condition for using the feature/class etc.</p>  <p>Is there anything else I need to worry about?</p>  <p>I read this question and it is helpful but I am wondering what else. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20327333/is-it-possible-to-create-an-app-ios-4-ios-7-compatible-with-xcode-5-0-2-on-mav">Is it possible to create an app iOS 4 - iOS 7 compatible with Xcode 5.0.2 on Mavericks?</a></p>  <p>THanks</p>
