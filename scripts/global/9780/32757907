<p>I am using Julia v 0.3.10 with Juno. I am trying to extract the symbols present in a SymPy symbolic expression, but the program hangs on me. </p>  <p>The following lines execute without error:</p>  <pre><code>Pkg.add("SymPy")                   (Ok) using SymPy                        (Ok) x, y, z = Sym("x", "y", "z")       x,y,z)  ex = x + 2y + 10z                  x + 2*y + 10z) symb = free_symbols(ex)            PyObject set([x, y, z]) vekt = convert(Vector{Sym}, symb)  Vector Sym,3 </code></pre>  <p>The following hangs the program, the "working" icon in the lower left shows up and never disappears.</p>  <pre><code>vekt[1] </code></pre>  <p>Why does this happen? Am I doing something wrong, if so, what? Is this a bug in Julia, if so: will it be fixed and is there a workaround?</p>  <p>Please help!</p>
