<p>Good day. I have a javascript array (I'm not entirely sure that it js-array) of the following type:</p>  <pre><code>RegionIds = [637640, 653240], countryIds = [621540, 803730], stamps = {     metro: "f4f9c25",     district: "2989c65",     road: "411c27f",     location: "cf2bf98",     directions: "e1e21ec" } </code></pre>  <p>Is there any method to convert it into a valid json for use in php? Accordingly, desirable solutions to the same php. Thank you in advance for your help</p>
