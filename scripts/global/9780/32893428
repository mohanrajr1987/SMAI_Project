<p>I am attempting to check whether a particular string is an <code>Int</code> (or <code>Boolean</code> or <code>Long</code> so on and so forth) but <strong>don't really need</strong> it to be parsed it to an <code>Int</code> (or others). I can think of two options. First, to do a <code>var.toInt.toString</code> or just return the actual string on which <code>toInt</code> was invoked if it's an <code>Int</code>. While both work just fine, I wanted to know if the former is a lot more expnsive compared to the latter. FYI, I won't be parsing really long strings this way, but I will be going through terabytes of data.</p>
