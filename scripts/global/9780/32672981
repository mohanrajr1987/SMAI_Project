<p>Is there a way to deny downcast of <em>Base</em> to <em>Derived</em> when <em>Base</em> is holding an instance of <em>Derived</em>? By default it's allowed.</p>  <pre class="lang-vb prettyprint-override"><code>Public Class Base End Class Public Class Derived     Inherits Base End Class  Public Class Program     Public Shared Sub Main()         TakesOnlyBase(New Derived)     End Sub      Public Shared Sub TakesOnlyBase(ByVal b As Base) 'Not allowed to make changes in Derived part on the instance         Dim d As Derived = CType(b, Derived) 'it works since the variable `b` is holding an instance of Derived. How to forbid this cast?         '...     End Sub End Class </code></pre>  <p>The easiest way would be implement conversion function in <em>Derived</em> and just throw an exception. </p>  <pre class="lang-vb prettyprint-override"><code>Public Shared Widening Operator CType(ByVal b As Base) As Derived 'Compiler error: Conversion operators cannot convert from a base type.     Throw New System.Exception("Not allowed") End Operator </code></pre>  <p>But conversion from a base type is not allowed. Any other possibilities to override default conversion?</p>  <p>Any other solutions? Thanks for your help.</p>
