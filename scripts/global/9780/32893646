<p>I have my class Stack </p>  <pre><code>class Stack { public:     Stack(unsigned int Size)    {     size = Size;    }  private:     unsigned int size;     void* Block; };  int _tmain(int argc, _TCHAR* argv[]) {     Stack x(-1);     return 0; } </code></pre>  <p>I want to make sure that even I pass negative value to the constructor argument  that the object wont be constructed , but when I'm giving -1 value , it's accepting it and the variable size value is 4294967295 , which is the same -1 after removing the sing bit as far as I know ...</p>  <p>so how I shall handle this situation ? shall I throw exception ? or just make to take default value in case of wrong value ?</p>
