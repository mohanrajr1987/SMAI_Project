(If this is true, then why did we set <code>m1</code> = <code>s1</code> earlier, when <code>s1</code> had a different type than <code>m1</code>??)</p></li> <li><p>What's the point of all this up casting and down casting? I've read the apple documentation and managed to confuse myself even more :'( </p></li> </ol>
