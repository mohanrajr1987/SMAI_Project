<p>I have a DTO which I want to convert to Entity.</p>  <p>Both DTO and Entity have a field: <code>List&lt;AbstractSomething&gt; somethings</code>.</p>  <p><code>AbstractSomething</code> is declared as <code>abstract</code>, and the list's values have concrete implementations.</p>  <p>When converting between the DTO and the Entity, I get this exception:</p>  <pre><code>No concrete class mapping defined for source </code></pre>  <p>I want Orika to use destination list's implementation the same as the source's type.</p>  <p>What is the best way to achieve this?</p>
