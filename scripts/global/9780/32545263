<p>everyone! I am very new to C++ and have been given an assignment in which I need to calculate time based on a certain number of hours translated into Days/Hours/Minutes. Yes, this is an assignment so I am not asking for a direct answer, rather someone with the knowledge to hopefully put me on the right track if that isn't too much to ask for.</p>  <p>My code is as follows:</p>  <pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt; using namespace std;  int main() {     double hours = 0;     int days = 0;     int finHours = 0;     int minutes = 0;      cout &lt;&lt; "Please enter a number of hours greater than zero: \n";       cin &gt;&gt; hours;     days = (hours /  24);     cout &lt;&lt; "hours equates to: \n" &lt;&lt; "\n" &lt;&lt; "Days: " &lt;&lt; days &lt;&lt; "d \n";      finHours = ((int)hours %  24);     cout &lt;&lt; "Hours: " &lt;&lt; finHours &lt;&lt; "h \n";      minutes = (hours /  60);     cout &lt;&lt; "Minutes: " &lt;&lt; minutes &lt;&lt; "m \n";     return 0; } </code></pre>  <p>Example Output: </p>  <p>Please enter a number of hours greater than zero:</p>  <p>25.5 hours equates to:</p>  <p>Days: 1d Hours: 1h Minutes: 0m</p>  <p>This unfortunately isn't correct. One day is correct, one hour is correct, but 25.5 hours does not equate to 1 day, 1 hour, and 0 minutes. I cannot seem to get my minutes code in working order. I believe my calculations are wrong as well as the fact I need to round the number to the nearest whole number. I have specific instructions that indicate I cannot use if/else statements and I must round the number using basic math. </p>  <p>I hope someone can put me on the right path to finding a solution, thank you for your time!</p>
