<p>Say I had the object:</p>  <pre><code>var object = {     1: [2,5,"hi"],     hi: {hihi: 1} }; </code></pre>  <p>How would I convert that to a string, and then back, preserving all the information? I would need this to work for a <em>big</em> object, with the values themselves being objects.</p>  <p><em>This is not a duplicate, the others didn't involve getting the object back.</em></p>
