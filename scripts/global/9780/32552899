<p>datatype hell here... I have succesfully called xml info from the web, only to not be able to change the type to something I can use...</p>  <p>here's part of the code :</p>  <pre><code>    Dim fxs As String     Dim fx As Double     m_xmld = New Xml.XmlDocument()     m_xmld.Load("http://rss.timegenie.com/forex.xml")     m_nodelist = m_xmld.SelectNodes("forex/data")     i = 0     For Each m_node In m_nodelist         fxs = Convert.ToString(m_node.Item("rate").InnerText)         fx = CDbl(fxs) </code></pre>  <p>the rest of the code is not relevant, but here's my problem: the "rate" comes in in the form of 4.047492763 I first tried to convert it to double, but then I get a null then I tried to convert it to a string, which works, but when I try to convert the string to a double, I get 4047492763 - the decimal point seems to have disappeared.</p>  <p>any help would be much appreciated!</p>
