<p>I am typing a series of numbers(double) separated by space into a textbox and i want to perform some simple division on these numbers after getting it from the textbox. This is my code. There is an error that says 'Operator '/' cannot be applied to operands of type 'string' and 'double'. </p>  <pre><code>    public string[] arrayvalues = new string[100];     public static double[] arraydivide = new double[100];     arrayvalues = text2.Text.Split(' ');     arrayvalues[i]/arraydivide[i];  </code></pre>  <p>so i am converting the string 'arrayvalues' to double using the below code and storing the calculated value into another double array</p>  <pre><code>   arrayanother[i] = Convert.ToDouble(arrayvalues[i])/arraydivide[i]; </code></pre>  <p>When i try to print the value of 'arrayanother' i get an error - </p>  <blockquote>   <p>An unhandled exception of type 'System.IndexOutOfRangeException' occurred in WpfApplication1.exe</p> </blockquote>  <p>Additional information: Index was outside the bounds of the array.</p>  <p>Basically i am not able to convert the string of numbers to 'double'. Anybody have any ideas?</p>
