<p>Here is my code in Microsoft Visual Studio ASP.NET MVC4 using C#</p>  <pre><code>int numRows = new SqlCommand("execute getRows", con); </code></pre>  <p>Error message:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Cannot implicitly convert type    'System.Data.SqlClient.SqlCommand' to 'int'</p> </blockquote>  <p>Am I missing a step? Like do I have to do an <code>ExecuteReader()</code> type of thing?</p>  <p>I can't find a good resource on using SQL commands in ASP.NET MVC 4. </p>  <p>I know NOT to use string concatenation b/c of SQL injection, so I'm trying to use SQL Server stored procedure. </p>  <p>Here is the procedure:</p>  <pre><code>CREATE PROCEDURE getRows AS BEGIN     select COUNT(*)      from myTable      where Status = 1 END </code></pre>  <p>Note: I have tried casting with <code>(int)</code> and with <code>Int.Parse</code>. I assume it has something to do with reading it? Or with making getRows procedure have an output?</p>
