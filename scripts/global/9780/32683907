<p>How can I convert .jhist files to json format in OSX?</p>  <p>I wonder if there are validated software packages or commands for doing so?</p>  <p>About <a href="https://www.altiscale.com/hadoop-blog/top-10-hadoop-yarn-part-1/" rel="nofollow">.jhist files</a>: Another important log for MapReduce jobs is the job history file (.jhist). These files contain a wealth of performance data on the execution of Mappers and Reducers, including HDFS statistics, data volume processed, memory allocated etc. We configure our History Server to write the jhist files to HDFS periodically using the mapreduce.jobhistory.done-dir parameter in yarn-site.xml</p>
