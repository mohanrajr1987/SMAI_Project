<p>I have a problem in general when Matlab is unable to work out how to logically store values of differing <code>uint</code> types. For example:</p>  <pre><code>tempC = {uint8(5) uint16(16)} </code></pre>  <p>For me, it seems logical to be able to convert this into a matrix of type integer using <code>cell2mat(tempC)</code>, which returns</p>  <pre><code>&gt;&gt; cell2mat(tempC) Error using cell2mat (line 45) All contents of the input cell array must be of the same data type. </code></pre>  <p>Of course, I understand that the truncation behaviour of integers depends on the type (e.g. <code>uint8</code> forces all numbers greater than 255 to be 255), however, in this case I would say it would be safe enough to output <code>cell2mat(tempC)</code> with <code>uint16</code> type. Does anyone have any ideas on how this can be achieved in general?</p>
