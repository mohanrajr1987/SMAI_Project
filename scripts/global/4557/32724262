<p>This may have been answered before and if so I'm sorry, but I haven't found anything in my searches.  I am trying to display a chart with a moving 'window' of values similar to Task Manager's display of CPU and Memory usage.  The data of my chart is being constantly updated and I want to only display the last 50 values added to the data.  Any help of this would be greatly appreciated.</p>
