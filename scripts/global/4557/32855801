<p>It is my understanding that value types like a Structure always occupy a sequential chunk of memory so it should be possible to get their bytes in a more efficient manner (as opposed to manually converting them into a byte array in .net or serializing them)</p>  <p>Lets say I have this simple structure in vb.net:</p>  <pre><code>Structure Banana     Public Length As UInt32     Public Curvature As Single End Structure </code></pre>  <p>And I do this:</p>  <pre><code>Dim blah As Banana blah.Length = 5 blah.Curvature = 2 DoSomethingWithPodItem(blah) </code></pre>  <p>which goes on to c++/cli function such as:</p>  <pre><code>void DoSomethingWithPodItem(Object^ Item) {     if (Item-&gt;GetType()-&gt;IsValueType) {         //somehow get a char* to the bytes that make up the item         //copy the bytes and go on doing whatever     } } </code></pre>  <p>How can I achieve whats described in the comment of the c++cli function? </p>
