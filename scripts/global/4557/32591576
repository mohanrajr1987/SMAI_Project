<p>Per user request I implemented NumericUpDown with varying Increment (0.1 on arrow press, 0.01 on SHIFT+arrow press) as suggested in this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/6961429/434378">answer</a>. It works very well when the user interacts with the mouse to press the control's arrows.</p>  <p>However, the keyboard input with the Up arrow does not trigger UpButton() when the SHIFT is pressed (same for the Down key and the DownButton()). Instead, the text in the control is being selected. Since the normal behavior is for both methods to be triggered when the keyboard arrows are pressed, of course I would like to keep this functionality on for the SHIFT combination as well.</p>  <p>So far I have tried overriding every method in the NumericUpDown which contains the "Key" word but none could help me. ProcessCmdKey can detect the key combination and disable the default selection behavior but it doesn't not lead to UpButton/DownButton being triggered either. </p>  <p>Any ideas?</p>
