<p>We have a VS2010 C++ project with <strong>No Common Language Runtime Support</strong> set in its project properties. Then I see that it has a source file containing some managed code and the properties for this file has "/clr" flag set. So the project does not have a /clr flag but a file inside it has. I am confused as to whether it makes the project a mixed mode one? I can open the output file in ILDisassembler which makes me believe that it indeed is a .NET assembly.</p>
