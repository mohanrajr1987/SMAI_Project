<p>Please can anyone shed light on this.</p>  <p>I have a program that uses the outlook interop assemblies, part of this is quite slow, and I would like to use native unmanaged c++ to manipulate the com object(s) for some more intensive work.</p>  <p>inline Microsoft::Office::Interop::Outlook::_Application^ OutlookApp()         {             return dynamic_cast(HostApplication);         }</p>  <p>What I would like to do is pass the above returned outlook object from that routine maybe with manipulation or pinning to an unmanaged c++ routine and then manipulate it as the underlying native com object so i get the speed of unmanaged com.  I am wondering how this could be done, or would this get marshalled back and forth even more than in managed c++.</p>  <p>Is this even possible and if so how, or is there something I do not understand about the concept and interop?</p>
