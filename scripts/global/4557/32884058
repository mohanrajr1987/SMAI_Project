<p>We ran into a problem where we get BadImageFormatException using Visual Studio 2013 and Windows 7 x64. Tested on Windows 8, 8.1 and 10 (x64) and it worked fine, but for some reason on Windows 7 x64 just throws this exception. </p>  <p>It throws exception on DllFile.Dll which was built using different Visual Studio vc++ project using /clr option. I am sure that we have right .NET Framework and VC++ Redistributables versions (because we are running Visual studio 2013 on all machines). Everything seems to be ok with bitness, both projects (C# and C++ clr) are set to x86. We even used Corflags.exe to set 32bit+ to make sure it runs uses 32bit dependencies.</p>  <p>Checking with Dependency walker there are two files missing GPSVC.DLL and IESHIMS.DLL, it looks like these files are not a problem (Or maybe they are??)</p>  <p>Used FusionLog haven't showed any errors. Used Process monitor haven't showed nothing interesting too. </p>  <p>Are there any other tools to solve this problem? Maybe someone got into this problem in the past using Windows 7?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
