<p>I know this is a very basic topic, but I've done research and yet haven't found a solution to my problem, which is getting the contents of a number of cells in a worksheet. This is what I have:</p>  <pre><code>Excel::Application^ ExList = gcnew Excel::ApplicationClass(); ExList-&gt;DisplayAlerts = false; ExList-&gt;Visible = false; Workbook^  Wbook1  = ExList-&gt;Workbooks-&gt;Open(Glo::m_archive01, Type::Missing, false, Type::Missing, Type::Missing, Type::Missing,     Type::Missing, Type::Missing, Type::Missing, Type::Missing, Type::Missing, Type::Missing, Type::Missing, Type::Missing, Type::Missing); Worksheet^ Wsheet1 = safe_cast&lt;Worksheet^&gt;(ExList-&gt;ActiveSheet); String^ m_new_section;//the variable to be displayed later on by means of MessageBox::Show(m_new_section);. </code></pre>  <p>This is what I've tried and the compiler errors I've gotten:</p>  <pre><code>m_new_section = Cells[5, 2]-&gt;Value; error C2065: 'Cells' : undeclared identifier error C2227: left of '-&gt;Value' must point to class/struct/union/generic type  m_new_section = ExList-&gt;Cells[5, 2] error C2440: '=' : cannot convert from 'System::Object ^' to 'System::String ^'  m_new_section = ExList-&gt;Cells[5, 2]-&gt;Value; error C2039: 'Value' : is not a member of 'System::Object'  m_new_section = Wsheet1-&gt;Cells[5, 2]; error C2440: '=' : cannot convert from 'System::Object ^' to 'System::String ^'  m_new_section = Wsheet1-&gt;Cells[5, 2]-&gt;Value; error C2039: 'Value' : is not a member of 'System::Object'  m_new_section = ExList-&gt;Cells[5, 2]-&gt;Value.ToString(); error C2039: 'Value' : is not a member of 'System::Object' error C2228: left of '.ToString' must have class/struct/union </code></pre>  <p>This one actually "worked"</p>  <pre><code>m_new_section = Wsheet1-&gt;Cells[5, 2]-&gt;ToString(); </code></pre>  <p>but all MessageBox showed for all the cells read was this string:  "System._ComObject".</p>  <p>What am I missing? A reference? Like I said before, I'm new at this and coding in c++/cli. My only references are examples I've found written in c#.</p>  <p>At this point, I'd appreciate any heLp. THANK YOU! </p>
