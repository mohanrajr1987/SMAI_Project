<p>How is even possible to .NET's P/invoke call a function within a DLL using only the dll file but for C++ you can't do it without the <code>.a/.lib</code>/<code>.o</code> files?</p>  <p>Background:</p>  <p>I'm trying to use a function from a dll "written" in C++ from a C++/CLI application but I've told that only the dll file plus header isn't enough I need to the <code>.a/.lib</code>/<code>.o</code> files too. How this dll was compiled using minGw and C++/CLI doesn't support <code>.a</code> files but only <code>.lib</code>s I'll have to recompile this dll using MSVC compiler/linker. So I wonder why does this "simple" thing in C# works:</p>  <pre><code>[DllImport("foo.dll",         CallingConvention = CallingConvention.Cdecl,         EntryPoint="_Z9getNumberv")]     public static extern int GetNumber(); </code></pre>  <p>But a dll in and for C++ it take more work/need to files.  I'm a begginer so I'm probably missing something.</p>
