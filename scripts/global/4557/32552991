<p>I am trying to debug C++/CLI Unitest, but the breakpoint cannot be hit. I have spent second hours hunting for the problem without any success.</p>  <p>How is the general procedure to to find the cause. What step should I do?</p>  <p>What I have done:</p>  <ul> <li>I have check the project properties, that Debugger type is mixed</li> <li><p>I have checked that symbols are loaded:</p>  <p>'QTAgent32_40.exe': Loaded 'C:\git....\Out\mydll.dll', Symbols loaded.</p></li> <li><p>I have checked that PDB file is compiled and available in the folder.</p></li> <li>I have checked that Debug Information Format is /Zi</li> <li>I have checked that Optimization is disabled.</li> <li>I have checked that preprocesor defintion _DEBUG;DEBUG are available</li> <li>I have checked that Generate Debug Info is Yes (/Debug)</li> <li>I have added line System::Diagnostics::Debugger::Break(). The breakpoint hits, but the source code is not available.</li> </ul>  <p>Want I am missing at most is some analytic approach. I am only able to check several options, but I don't know how should I proceed generally with this kind of problems. How to inspect "why". How to get the reason why breakpoint is not hit. I mean something "How to debug debugger"</p>  <p><em>I use Visual Studio Community Edition 2015 with V120_xp platform toolset. It is problem only of this project/solution. Another projects (C#) works fine with the debugger.</em></p>  <p>UPDATE:</p>  <p>I created the test by following:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/IBMHq.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/IBMHq.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Even if I create the new Managed Test Project from scratch with simple HelloWorld method, the breakpoint is not hit.</p>
