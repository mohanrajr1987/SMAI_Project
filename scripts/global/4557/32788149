<p>Hi I'm currently using Microsoft Visual Studio 2015, c++ with forms and having trouble with split. I have tried many code exemples (all of them was on console application and I didn't know how to make them work for me). This is how at least I imagining code (simplified code exemple below). There is a string that you take from textBox1, then you split that string where there is a dot, and putting them in table.</p>  <pre><code>String ^ text = textBox1-&gt;Text; text-&gt;ToString()-&gt;Split('.'); tableGrid-&gt;Rows[0]-&gt;Cells[1]-&gt;Value = text; </code></pre>
