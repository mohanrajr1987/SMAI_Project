<p>I'm relatively new to C++, and I'm trying to take an array within a class, and set it equal to a passed in array.</p>  <pre><code>public ref class Example {     array&lt;float&gt; ^ myarray1 = gcnew array&lt;float&gt;(3); public:     Example(float^ myarray2) {         int i = 0;         while (i&lt;3) {             myarray[i] = myarray2[i];             i += 1;         } } </code></pre>  <p>In the main function, the constructor is called as follows:</p>  <pre><code>float myarray2[] = {1,2,3}; Example ^example1 = gcnew Example(*myarray2) </code></pre>  <p>The errors I get is are as follows: </p>  <ol> <li>System::Single' has no default indexed property (class indexer)</li> <li>expression must have pointer-to-object or handle-to-C++/CLI-array     type</li> </ol>  <p>Both of these errors are identified as happening where I am saying myarray[i] = myarray2[i].</p>  <p>I would greatly appreciate any help with solving this problem. I can't see where or how System::Single is getting pulled in as an error message. And, before it is suggested, I know I can get to work with setting myarray2 as a array float like myarray1, but I want it to work passing in myarray2 as float^ myarray2.</p>
