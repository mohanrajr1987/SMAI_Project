<p>I know there are similar questions out there but I've tried lots of them and still can't get this right.</p>  <p>I have a method that takes in a System::String^ and internally obtains a VARIANT. I want to compare the var.bstrVal with my string and it never seems to find a match even though I know it does. Here is the code (NOTE: I have updated this with more detail):</p>  <pre><code>System::String^ filterName = "MyStringThatMatches"; //pass to method and code to build up the VARIANT called var... IPropertyBag *pPropBag; pMoniker-&gt;BindToStorage(0, 0, IID_PPV_ARGS(&amp;pPropBag)); VARIANT var; VariantInit(&amp;var); pPropBag-&gt;Read(L"FriendlyName", &amp;var, 0); pin_ptr&lt;const wchar_t&gt; convertedFilter = PtrToStringChars(filterName);     if (0 == wcscmp(var2.bstrVal, convertedFilter)) </code></pre>  <p>So the wcscmp never finds a match. I thought I was on the right track here.. Any ideas?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
