<p>This intellisense error is driving me nuts in C++/CLI.  It suddenly arrived out of nowhere and won't go away.  If anyone has any suggestions on how to make it go bye-bye, I'd love to hear them.</p>  <p>The error is from "atlbase.h" - I'd like to pretend to know what this header is, but I don't.  There are five errors all occurring on identical lines like this:</p>  <pre><code>#pragma warning(push)  // disable 4483 #pragma warning(disable:4483)         using namespace __identifier("&lt;AtlImplementationDetails&gt;"); //ERROR HERE #pragma warning(pop)  // disable 4483 </code></pre>  <p>The error is: "expected a c++ keyword" - the whole thing still builds but it really bugs me to have non-existent errors cluttering up stuff.</p>  <p>Other people online have had this exact error and the only suggestions I've seen for it are "disable intellisense errors" (no way is that a "solution") and something like "change build target for OpenCV from version 11 to version 12" (I have no idea what this means - maybe this is my problem - but I have no idea what this means).  I am still pretty new to C++ standard library, much less various APIs... do I have OpenCV?  I'm just using Visual Studio 2015 standard SDKs.</p>  <p>Here's <a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/a22945dd-be5d-4d85-9fcc-3887cb938bf4/intellisense-expeted-a-c-keyword?forum=vcgeneral" rel="nofollow">someone else with the same error</a> </p>
