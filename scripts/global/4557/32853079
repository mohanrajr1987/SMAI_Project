<p>Using visual studio here. In code below you can see a string being a split, and I want put each split string in a new row, but program crashes not creating a new row and I got error: Exception thrown: 'System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException' in mscorlib.dll    Additional information: Index was out of range. Must be non-negative and less than the size of the collection.</p>  <pre><code> String^ text = textBox1-&gt;Text;         cli::array&lt;String^&gt;^ part = text-&gt;Split('.','?','!');         for (int split = 0; split &lt; part-&gt;Length; ++split) {     datagrid-&gt;Rows[split]-&gt;Cells[3]-&gt;Value = part[split];     } </code></pre>
