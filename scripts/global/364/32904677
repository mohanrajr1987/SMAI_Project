<p>I have a model News with an image and those News can be loaded via an JSON REST API. The server is signed with a certificate from an Authority and all request must be done with https.</p>  <p>My problem is, the ModelSerializer serialize the ImageField with http and not https. How do I change that ?</p>  <p>Here is an abstract of code and output example:</p>  <pre><code>#myProject/models.py class News(models.Model):     image = models.ImageField()  #myProject/serializers.py class NewsSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):     class Meta:         model = News         fields = ('image')  #request for a news https://myDomain/news/the-news-id-here/  #current output {     "image": "http://myDomain/media/news/imageName.jpg" }  #wanted output {     "image": "https://myDomain/media/news/imageName.jpg" } </code></pre>  <p>Thanks David</p>
