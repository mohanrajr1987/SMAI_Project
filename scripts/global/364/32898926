<p>Is it considered bad practice to design a REST API that may have an ambiguity in the path resolution?  For example:</p>  <pre><code>GET /animals/{id}   // Returns the animal with the given ID GET /animals/dogs   // Returns all animals of type dog </code></pre>  <p>Ok, that's contrived, because you would actually just do <code>GET /dogs</code>, but hopefully it illustrates what I mean.  From a path resolution standpoint, it seems like you wouldn't know whether you were looking for an animal with <code>id="dogs"</code> or just all the <code>dogs</code></p>  <p>Specifically, I'm interested in whether Jersey would have any trouble resolving this.  What if you knew the <code>id</code> to be an integer?</p>
