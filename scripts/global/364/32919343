<p>How do I render embedded objects in Apigility?  For example, if I have a 'user' object and it composes a 'country' object, should I be rendering the 'country' object as an embedded object?  And how should I do this?</p>  <p>I am using the <code>Zend\Stdlib\Hydrator\ArraySerializable</code>.  My <code>getArrayCopy()</code> method simply returns an array of properties that I want exposed.  The array keys are the property names.  The array values are the property values.  In the case of <code>user-&gt;country</code>, the value is an object, not a scalar.</p>  <p>When I return the user object from <code>UserResource-&gt;fetch()</code>, here's how it is rendered:</p>  <pre><code>{   "id": "1",   "firstName": "Joe",   "lastName": "Bloggs",   "status": "Active",   "email": "test@example.com",   "country": {     "code": "AU",     "name": "Australia"   },   "settings": "0",   "_links": {     "self": {       "href": "http://api.mydomain.local/users/1"     }   } } </code></pre>  <p>Note that 'country' is not in an <code>_embedded</code> field.  If it is supposed to be in <code>_embedded</code>, I would have thought that Apigility would automatically do that (since it automatically adds the <code>_links</code> object).</p>  <p>As a related issue, how do I go about returning other rel links, such as back, forward, etc?</p>
