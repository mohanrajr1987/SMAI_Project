<p>If I have a Parse.com API with applicationId APPLICATION_ID and REST-API-Key REST_API_KEY, and the classname is Story, then what should the GET request structure look like. I tried the following :</p>  <p><a href="https://api.parse.com/1/story/applicationId=APPLICATION_ID&amp;REST-API-Key=REST_API_KEY" rel="nofollow">https://api.parse.com/1/story/applicationId=APPLICATION_ID&amp;REST-API-Key=REST_API_KEY</a></p>  <p>but it didn't work.</p>
