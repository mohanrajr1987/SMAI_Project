<p><strong>Hi everybody,</strong></p>  <p>I encounter implementation issues with the rest-dispatch module of the gwtp framework.</p>  <p>If i follow the current <a href="http://dev.arcbees.com/gwtp/" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>, the resource interface defining what a service provide should be as follow:</p>  <pre><code>@Path(FOO) @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON) public interface FooResource {      @GET     RestAction&lt;FooDTO&gt; getFoo();  } </code></pre>  <p>On the client side (without delegate extension):</p>  <pre><code>@Inject RestDispatch dispatcher; @Inject FooResource fooResource;  ... dispatcher.execute(fooResource.getFoo(), new AsyncCallback&lt;FooDTO&gt;() {      @Override      public void onFailure(Throwable throwable) {       }       @Override      public void onSuccess(FooDTO fooDto) {       } }); ... </code></pre>  <p><strong>Question</strong></p>  <p>The RestDispatch is waiting for method that return RestAction, but since the RestService interface has been remove from 1.5 release:</p>  <p>How can i implements the FooResource ?</p>  <p><strong>Moreover</strong></p>  <p>In the carstore sample project, the only resource that uses RestAction is: <a href="https://github.com/ArcBees/GWTP-Samples/blob/master/carstore/src/main/java/com/gwtplatform/carstore/shared/api/StatisticsResource.java" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/ArcBees/GWTP-Samples/blob/master/carstore/src/main/java/com/gwtplatform/carstore/shared/api/StatisticsResource.java</a></p>  <p>But it's implementation, is in fact not an implementation in that case: <a href="https://github.com/ArcBees/GWTP-Samples/blob/master/carstore/src/main/java/com/gwtplatform/carstore/server/api/StatisticsResourceImpl.java" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/ArcBees/GWTP-Samples/blob/master/carstore/src/main/java/com/gwtplatform/carstore/server/api/StatisticsResourceImpl.java</a></p>  <p>Should i follow this example, and what is the purpose of an non-implemented Interface ?</p>  <p>I assume that my question is very specific and it is maybe principally directed to the authors of gwtp.</p>  <p>And i thank in advance those who will respond.</p>
