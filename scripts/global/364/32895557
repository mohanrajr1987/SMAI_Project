<p>I have a design question on REST. I need to expose a validate method as a rest resource. Let us say it looks like this</p>  <pre><code>public ValidatedResult validate(ObjectToBeValidated object) </code></pre>  <p><code>ObjectToBeValidated</code> is a class that contains the actual <code>Object</code> and also some parameters concerning the validation.</p>  <p>When I design this as a Restful resource, which action do I use? From my understanding GET is the action that best suits this case. If that is so, how I can pass my <code>ObjectTobeValidated</code> as an object but not as URL parameters? I shy away from URL parameters because <code>ObjectToBeValidated</code> may contain a lot of properties, ending up with an URL like below which is feel is too long</p>  <pre><code>http://localhost/rest/validate?prop1=somevalu&amp;prop2=somevalue&amp;prop3=something&amp;prop11=somevalu&amp;prop22=somevalue&amp;prop33=something </code></pre>  <p>Any help would be appreciated</p>  <p>Thanks Kay</p>
