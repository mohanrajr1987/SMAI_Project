<p>In Express 4.0, after declaring the server I do the following to set a server-wide variable...</p>  <pre><code>var app = express(); app.set('foo', 'bar'); </code></pre>  <p>I don't see a method like that in Restify's documentation, so I'm just declaring an object inside the server that holds my variables.</p>  <p>Is that correct? Is there a better way to do this in Restify?</p>
