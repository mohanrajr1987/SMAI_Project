<p>What would be an appropriate REST compatible approach that would allow a client to call a RESTful service in order to convert a (large) document to a target format ?</p>  <p>I was thinking about something similar to this :</p>  <ol> <li>Client makes a <code>POST</code> on <code>/conversion/request</code> resource with conversion configuration (target type, secure key, notification resource URL in the form <a href="http://host_to_be_notified/notification/status/id" rel="nofollow">http://host_to_be_notified/notification/status/id</a>) that will return a request id. The conversion request would be added to an internal queue and can be modified / deleted by the client as long as the conversion is not started.</li> <li>Once conversion is started the <code>/conversion/request/id</code> is deleted by the server</li> <li>Once conversion is done the server creates a <code>/conversion/result/id</code> (same id as above in 1) resource then does a PUT on the notification status resource (to set it to "ready" and providing the key) which will inform the client of the completion of its request </li> <li>When ready the client makes a <code>GET</code> on <code>/conversion/result/id</code> resource to obtain the converted document</li> <li>If the client went offline for any reason, he can try to retrieve the result as in 4. If the document is not ready, the client just has to wait for the notification to be sent.</li> </ol>  <p>However...</p>  <ol> <li>Is it a valid approach ?</li> <li>should I forget about using REST and should I rather think about using SOAP (and have a blocking call, knowing that I would prefer avoiding blocking calls) or JMS (all approaches have their pros/cons, and one big cons against JMS in my context is that it would require the setup of queues for all clients which may be refused) (note: that's why I also added "SOAP" and "JMS" tags to this question)</li> <li>Any idea of how to improve the approach and what are the questions I should think about before going any further ?</li> </ol>  <p>Thanks in advance for your help !</p>  <p>Michel</p>
