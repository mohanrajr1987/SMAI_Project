<p>Is there a way to send PUT and DELETE requests with <code>webread()</code> / <code>webwrite()</code>? </p>  <p>Trying to do <code>opt = weboptions('RequestMethod','delete')</code> gets me the following error message:</p>  <pre><code>Error using weboptions (line 223) Expected RequestMethod to match one of these strings:  'auto', 'get', 'post'  The input, 'delete', did not match any of the valid strings. </code></pre>
