<p>It's the variable number of lists that is confusing me. It's easy to (pseudo code)...</p>  <pre><code> for i=1 to list1_size    for ii=1 to list2_size      for iii=1 to list3_size         results_list.add(list1[i]+list2[ii]+list3[iii]) </code></pre>  <p>... but I could do with a nudge in the right direction regarding how to do this with a varying number of lists.</p>  <p>I've started with getting a table of the number of entries in each list to work through and it does seem like a bit of recursion is required but from there I'm drawing a blank.</p>  <p>edit: To clarify, what I am looking for is...</p>  <p>Input: A varying number of lists/tables with a varying numbers of entries.</p>  <pre><code>{"A","B","C"}  {"1","2","3","4"}  {"*","%"} </code></pre>  <p>Output:</p>  <pre><code>{"A1*", "A1%", "A2*", "A2%", "A3*", "A3%", "A4*", "A4%",  "B1*", "B1%", "B2*", "B2%", "B3*", "B3%", "B4*", "B4%",  "C1*", "C1%", "C2*", "C2%", "C3*", "C3%", "C4*", "C4%"} </code></pre>
