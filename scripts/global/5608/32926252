<p>Ive been following TheCherno's network chat programming tutorials, and I am almost done, just fixing bugs when I ran into a problem. I have a button that opens a window that is supposed to have a list of all the connected users listed. However, everytime I test it, the only item on the list is the first person who connected to that instance of the server. It is the same for all of the other users connected as well. I have no errors in my code, and it all seems correct. I can't seem to find the error. </p>  <p>This function is called from a while running loop, and everything else in it is working constantly, so I don't think there is something wrong in this.</p>  <pre><code>private void sendStatus() {         if (clients.size() &lt;= 0) return;     String users = "/u/";     for (int i = 0; i &lt; clients.size() - 1; i++) {         users += clients.get(i).name + "/n/";     }     users += clients.get(clients.size() - 1).name + "/e/";     sendToAll(users); } </code></pre>  <p>This is from another class, where the client decodes the messages sent from the server.</p>  <pre><code>else if (message.startsWith("/u/")) {                     String[] u = message.split("/u/|/n/|/e/");                     users.update(Arrays.copyOfRange(u, 1, u.length - 1));                 } </code></pre>  <p>And then this is the peice that handles the graphics of it, I don't see anything wrong in it, but I will include it anyway jsut in case. Thanks all!</p>  <pre><code>    private JPanel contentPane; private JList list; public OnlineUsers() {     setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.DISPOSE_ON_CLOSE);     setSize(200, 320);     setLocationRelativeTo(null);     contentPane = new JPanel();     contentPane.setBorder(new EmptyBorder(5, 5, 5, 5));     setContentPane(contentPane);     GridBagLayout gbl_contentPane = new GridBagLayout();     gbl_contentPane.columnWidths = new int[]{0, 0};     gbl_contentPane.rowHeights = new int[]{0, 0};     gbl_contentPane.columnWeights = new double[]{1.0, Double.MIN_VALUE};     gbl_contentPane.rowWeights = new double[]{1.0, Double.MIN_VALUE};     contentPane.setLayout(gbl_contentPane);      list = new JList();     GridBagConstraints gbc_list = new GridBagConstraints();     gbc_list.fill = GridBagConstraints.BOTH;     gbc_list.gridx = 0;     gbc_list.gridy = 0;     JScrollPane p = new JScrollPane();     p.setViewportView(list);     contentPane.add(p, gbc_list);     list.setFont(new Font("Verdana", 0, 14)); }  public void update(String[] users) {     list.setListData(users); } </code></pre>  <p>Still no ideas at all. I even checked the source code that the tutorial person made and its the same thing. I would really appreciate the help, as I am 14 and just learning java.
