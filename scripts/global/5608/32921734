<p>Using python 2.7.6, I want to know how to replace the line I last printed. It is printing something every time a for loop repeats, and I want to be able to replace the previously written text with a new piece of text. How do I do this? The code is something like.</p>  <pre><code>Test = ["1","2","3","4","5"] for x in range (0,9):     change = raw_input()     Test.append(change)     print "%s and %s and %s and %s and %s " + change </code></pre>
