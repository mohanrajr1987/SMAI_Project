<p>I'm using Tkinter to create a window in python and a canvas to display graphics in the window. This is working fine so far.</p>  <p>But I have a two dimensional list containing colours that I would like to directly place on the canvas.</p>  <h2>Example</h2>  <p>I have a class defined (named CRGB) that has three variables: r, g and b. These are the red, green and blue values of a colour, and are integers between 0 and 255.</p>  <p>I also have a two-dimensional list, which contains CRGB objects with the colour data.</p>  <p>I then have a Canvas (defined in a variable called screenCanvas) which is the same size as the 2D list.</p>  <p>How would I transfer the pixels from the 2D list to the canvas?</p>  <p>Notes: I would like the code to work on Mac AND Windows, and not use any external libraries (libraries not included in Python by default.)</p>
