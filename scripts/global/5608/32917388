<p>I have a list with lenght of: <code>370000</code>. In this list i have items like: <code>"a", "y", "Y", "q", "Q", "p", "P",</code>, meaning this is a list of words but from time to time i get those single characters.</p>  <p>I want to remove those characters from the list, i am pretty new in python but the first thing that came to my mind was to do something like: </p>  <pre><code>for word in words:     if word== 'm' or  word== 'y' or word== 'Y' or word== 'p' or word== 'Q' or word== 'q' or word== 'a' or word== 'uh':         words.remove(word) </code></pre>  <p>In a list with 370.000 items this method is taking a loooot of time. Seriously, a lot.</p>  <p>Does anyone have another awesome idea on how to get a better performance?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
