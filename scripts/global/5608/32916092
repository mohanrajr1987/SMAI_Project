<p>I am completely new to Yaml but require it for a project. I have a YAML file which I am using to populate a list in a Python file which interacts with the data.</p>  <p>My data looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>Employees:     custid: 200     user: Ash         - Smith         - Cox </code></pre>  <p>I need the python code to iterate over this YAML file and populate a list like this, </p>  <pre><code>list_of_Employees = ['Ash', 'Smith' 'Cox'] </code></pre>  <p>I know the file must be opened and store the data in a variable but I cannot figure out how to enter each element separately in a list. Ideally I would like to use the append function so I don't have to determine my 'user' size everytime</p>
