<p>I have encountered a problem I don't really understand involving lists and indexes. Code follows:</p>  <pre><code>listA = [-1 for i in range(1, 14)];  def functionA(num):     for i in range (1, 14):         listA[i] = num  functionA(1); </code></pre>  <p>This gives me the 'IndexError: list assignment index out of range' message. I added in some print() statements in the space before functionA(1) to help debug, and found out that the loop is completing the iteration at listA[12], but failing when it reaches listA[13].</p>  <p>I had originally set the range(a, b) statements to end at 14 because I understood that that second parameter was not inclusive, and so should end at 13. How can it even try to write to the 13th index if the first line of code does not assign that index a value? Can somebody help/explain please? </p>
