<p>I have the following code, rnning perfectly fine. However, always trying to improve things, I was wondering if we could write this with just one line:</p>  <pre><code>l,listSex = [], ['male1', 'female23', 'male2', 'female1', 'female2'] for s in listSex:     if 'female' in s:         l.append(1)     else:         l.append(0) </code></pre>  <p>My problem here is how to handle the else case (as otherwise, the answer would have been pretty straightforward).</p>
