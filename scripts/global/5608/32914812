<p>I have tried some ways but they either don't work or turn out to be a letter for each item in the list. For example, this (for writing the list):</p>  <pre><code>with open("data.txt", 'w') as f:     for s in data:         f.write(s + '\n') </code></pre>  <p>and this (for reading the list):</p>  <pre><code>try:     with open("data.txt", 'r') as f:         data = [Line.rstrip('\n') for Line in f] except FileNotFoundError:     print ("There is nothing to show") else:     print (data)  </code></pre>  <p>Prints out this when the list I want in the file is "['Bob:6', 'Dave:4']" :</p>  <pre><code>['B', 'o', 'b', ':', '6', 'D', 'a', 'v', 'e', ':', '4']  </code></pre>  <p>Basically, I want it to be readable properly, with the different values separated properly.</p>
