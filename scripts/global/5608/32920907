<p>This is what I have so far: </p>  <pre><code>public void insert(int position, ValueNode value) {   if (position == 1) {     this.nextInRow = value;   }   ValueNode current = this.getFirst();   if (position &gt; 1) {     current.setNext(current.next);   }     value.setNextInRow(current.getNext()); } </code></pre>  <p>The headnode is being set properly with the first if statement. In this list we already know the position, so I'm thinking we don't need a while loop since we know where to put the new node. </p>  <p>I create a temp node called current to hold the next node pointer, but right now it sets the pointer to null. My problem is I don't know where to point the next node pointer to. Any help would be very much appreciated. </p>
