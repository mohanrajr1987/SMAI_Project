<p>I have a rented VPS wieh debian installed. Recently I've installed proftpd in order to allow read-only access to everybody &amp; full access for the particular users.</p>  <p>I configured proftpd (with tls) according to several guides. I've unlocked passive ports and set up anonymous login.</p>  <p>When I log in, everything's all right - fast login, fast walking through dirs...problem occurs when I try to download a file - winscp/filezilla/python, all get stuck on downloading a file and then loose connection (files are ~1kB, so very small). When I am connected through SFTP to the server, I have no problems and full speed.</p>  <p>Any ideas? Do you need my proftpd.conf file?</p>  <p>Best regards</p>
