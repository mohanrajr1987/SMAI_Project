<p>We are starting a project soon that requires integration to a legacy system. That system requires us to use FTP &amp; CSV as our communcation protocol and data format. </p>  <p>As we're in the design phase, we're trying to decide best practices on using FTP. One of the caveats is that we will be passing data back/forth fairly frequently (every 60 to 120 seconds). We're concerned about collisions where the "TO" system goes out to find a file and the "FROM" system is still writing the file, and we may get incomplete data. (is this a valid concern?)</p>  <p>To mitigate this, we figured we'd have the file extension be something like .wri while writing, then the last step of the FTP script would rename from .wri to .csv...</p>  <p>In terms of file naming we were going to include a data/time stamp (maybe YYYYMMDDHHMISS) as part of the file name. We were also going to include the data type and the TO and FROM system as part of the file name... So it might look like ORDERS_20150929133559_TO-LEGACY_FROM-WEB.csv</p>  <p>Love to hear other's experience with this, and if there's other things we should be thinking about.</p>
