<p>I have been trying to send JSON encoded data to my remote server for storage, but I have not been able to get it to work. I am hoping to send the JSON data to an existing file on my server and append it to the end of the file.</p>  <p>Here is what I'm working with:</p>  <pre><code>$jsondata = json_encode($record);  $conn_id = ftp_connect("ftp://MY-USERNAME:MY-PASSWORD@MY-REMOTE-ADDRESS"); $temphandle = fopen('php://temp', 'r+'); fwrite($temphandle, $jsondata); rewind($temphandle);  if(ftp_fput($conn_id, 'test.txt', $temphandle, FTP_ASCII)){     echo "Successfully uploaded data"; } else {     echo "There was a problem while uploading data"; };  ftp_close($conn_id); fclose($temphandle); </code></pre>  <p>My if statement must be returning fail because I am getting the problem error. I believe my FTP connection is successful. I have tried to put this together by studying many samples and I am unsure as to where my problem is. I am thinking one of the parameters for my <code>ftp_fput</code> function is incorrect. I greatly appreciate any help in getting this to work.</p>  <p>Thanks </p>
