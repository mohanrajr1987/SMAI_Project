<p>I am having trouble using TidFTP to upload a file. The source is a known good zip file and the code below is used to transfer it. It transfers apparently fine and I can use the FTP viewer WinSCP to drag and drop the site copy back to my desktop again but then it will not open with a 'Zip file is invalid' message. The file is about 137k and there is a 3 byte file size difference between the uploaded file and the source, so clearly they are not the same. If I un-comment the verify operation this too returns FALSE. </p>  <p>Can anyone suggest where I might look? I'm using Delphi 10 and Windows 10.</p>  <pre><code>procedure TForm1.Button1Click(Sender: TObject); var   FTP : TidFTP; const   sSourceFile = 'C:\scratch\hope.zip';   sDestFolder = '/scratch';   sDestFileName = 'hope.zip'; begin   FTP := TidFTP.Create( nil );   try     FTP.Host := 'www.mysite.co.uk';     FTP.Username := 'username';     FTP.Password := 'password';     FTP.Passive := True;     FTP.TransferTimeout := 1000;     FTP.ConnectTimeout := 2000;     FTP.ReadTimeout := 3000;      FTP.Connect();      FTP.ChangeDir( sDestFolder );     FTP.Put( sSourceFile, sDestFileName );      //if not FTP.VerifyFile( sSourceFile, sDestFileName ) then     //  ShowMessage( 'File verify error' );      ShowMessage( 'done' );    finally     FTP.Disconnect;     FTP.Free;   end; end; </code></pre>
