<p>I am trying to move a file from one subdomain to another on webmin. The file does move but at the destination it always has a size of 0 bytes. </p>  <pre><code>    $source = '/home/webminuser1/public_html/some_file.php';     $dest = '/home/webminuser2/public_html/some_file.php';     $server = 'valid_server_name';      $connection = ftp_connect($server);     ftp_login($connection, 'webminuser2', 'some_password');     ftp_pasv($connection, true);      ftp_put($connection, $dest , $source , FTP_ASCII); </code></pre>  <p>There was a similar question suggesting using passive mode and trying out both FTP_ASCII and FTP_BINARY. I tried both and am using passive mode as you can see(if I don't use it I get an error). So the problem is not there.</p>  <p>Any ideas what could be causing it? When I execute the script I get a very long loading time followed by an internal server error 500. The file is at it's destination but has a file size of 0 bytes. <strong>It is important to note I am on an webmin server.</strong></p>
