<p>I am using the Zehon FTP utility on a ColdFusion 9 server. When I am FTP'ing files, it creates one directory, transfers about 16 files, then gives the message :</p>  <pre><code>com.zehon.exception.FileTransferException: org.apache.commons.vfs.FileSystemException: Could not connect to FTP server on "ftpservername.com". </code></pre>  <p>Here's the code:</p>  <pre><code>    &lt;cfscript&gt; //FTP server information host = "#getSiteList.TMS_FTPADDRESS#"; username = "#getSiteList.TMS_USERNAME#"; password = "#getSiteList.TMS_PASSWORD#";   /* sendingFolder = Folder whose content is to be uploaded recursively *  to the FTP server. */ sendingFolder = "#local_Folder#";  /* Forward slash / = root dir of FTP server. *  if you wish to FTP to privateDir under the root, for example, *  then set destFolder to "/privateDir" */ destFolder = "/#parent_Folder#"; FTP = createObject("java", "com.zehon.ftp.FTP"); thisBatchTransferProgressDefault= createObject("java", "com.zehon.BatchTransferProgressDefault").init(); FileTransferStatus = createObject("java", "com.zehon.FileTransferStatus"); try {    status = FTP.sendFolder(sendingFolder, destFolder, thisBatchTransferProgressDefault, host, username, password);     if(FileTransferStatus.SUCCESS is status){         writeOutput(sendingFolder &amp; " got ftp-ed successfully to folder " &amp; destFolder);     }     else if(FileTransferStatus.FAILURE is status){         writeOutput("Failed to ftp to folder " &amp; destFolder);     } } catch (any e) {    writeOutput(e.message); }    &lt;/cfscript&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I tried this on two different servers and the same issue. If I use FileZilla or CFFTP, I can transfer all my files (CFFTP is having issues creating subfolders, which is why I moved away from that, and we want our customers to use their web app to FTP files, not a client). Has anyone else experience this? If so, was a solution discovered? Thanks</p>
