<p>I have an MVC site which places images on a page like:</p>  <pre><code>    @foreach (var itm in Model) {     {         &lt;img class="images" style="padding-left: 10px; padding-top: 15px;"          src="~/Content/images/@itm.ImageUrl" /&gt;     } } </code></pre>  <p>Previously it has not been intended to support adding of images and so all ImageUrl's pointed to a place holder silhouette photo. Now however I am uploading the images via my API over FTP.</p>  <p>The images were on the server, with the page referring to precisely the correct site location for each image, however the images weren't found like they didn't exist. The location is DEFINITELY correct as the place holder silhouette image displays correctly.</p>  <p>I then added the images into my VS project and did a publish and weirdly that worked, the images now displayed fine.</p>  <p>This obviously doesn't solve the problem as the API should store the images in the site without me having to publish from VS every time!</p>  <p>I publish the images to FTP like:</p>  <pre><code>public static bool ftpTransfer(string fileName, byte[] image) {      byte[] buffer = image;      string ftpAddress = "xxxxx";      string username = "xxxxx";      string password = "xxxxx";       WebRequest request = WebRequest.Create(ftpAddress + "/" + "site" + "/" + "wwwroot" + "/" + "Content" + "/" + "images" + "/" + fileName);      request.Method = WebRequestMethods.Ftp.UploadFile;      request.Credentials = new NetworkCredential(username, password);      Stream reqStream = request.GetRequestStream();      reqStream.Write(buffer, 0, buffer.Length);      reqStream.Close();  return true; } </code></pre>  <p>So what is going on and why doesn't the <code>src="~/Content/images/@itm.ImageUrl"</code> find the image until I publish, despite it being in the folder?</p>
