<p>I have a question regarding the Http and FTP. I have already wrote  the utility to download the image file from the Server(images are stored on these servers) using FTP protocol. The utility class is getting invoked from the Spring mvc controller. The utility is working fine but is usage of FTP protocol correct in the case or should I rewrite the utility and use the HTTP protocol image downloading? Which protocol will be faster in this case?</p>
