<p>I followed this tutorial in DigitalOcean: <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-vsftpd-on-ubuntu-12-04" rel="nofollow">https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-vsftpd-on-ubuntu-12-04</a></p>  <p>But I can't intall a plugin in WordPress because I can't connect to ftp. The port I think is 220 or 22. How Can I change it?</p>  <p>Thank you very much</p>
