<p>I have a FTP server (IIS) in cloud. It deals with files (text) having size in GB sometimes. Customers are complaining about the connection failures or download/upload failures. Is there any way I can log any failed (negative) action performed with my FTP server?</p>  <p>I have tried IFtpLogProvider in .Net but it does not give me valid FTP Status. for example, if I start an upload &amp; download from client &amp; disconnect the network, still it records status as 226 which is successful transfer. Either I am missing something with IFtpLogProvider or I have misunderstood the codes.</p>  <p>Is there any other way to record all the FTP transactions which will allow me to investigate the issue being faced by my customers?</p>
