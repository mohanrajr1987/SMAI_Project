<p>I am attempting to FTP many files from a VAX/VMS server to a local PC via the mget command. It works for several files, but fails after too many files because the remote server closes the connection. It is not expected that this is due to administrative controls - it fails after a "random" number of files after several attempts with different types of files. It seems ASCII mode has the problem earlier than BINARY file transfer mode.</p>  <p>Say I want to transfer 2000 ASCII files from the VAX/VMS machine to my local PC that have extension ASC. The following records my commands and the failure.</p>  <pre><code>ftp remote.server.location.com Connected to remote.server.location.com. 220 remote.server.location.com FTP Server (Version 5.6) Ready.
