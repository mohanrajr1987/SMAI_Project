<p>I wrote a php script locally on my machine that worked. But when I uploaded it too  my ftp server i ran into some issues. Obviously I couldn`t use rename function etc, and had to change to ftp_rename etc. So the problem is that I can't rename or delete any files with my php script. I have tried to change permissions on files and root directory without any luck. I can browse the files, but not rename or delete them. I don't get any error messages either, the file doesn't load and I get a 500 server error if I try to rename or delete. Any suggestions? </p>  <pre><code>$ftp_server = ""; $ftp_conn = ftp_connect($ftp_server) or die("Could not connect to $ftp_server"); $login = ftp_login($ftp_conn, "username", "password");  $files = ftp_rawlist($ftp_conn, "www/subtitlesyncer/uploads"); ftp_delete($ftp_conn, "www/subtitlesyncer/uploads/newfile.txt") if (ftp_rename($ftp_conn, "www/subtitlesyncer/uploads/newfile.txt","www/subtitlesyncer/uploads/new_file_edited.txt")) {     ... } </code></pre>  <p>I use this settings, but can`t get any error.</p>  <pre><code>ini_set('display_errors',1); ini_set('display_startup_errors',1); error_reporting(-1); </code></pre>  <p>This is the file I try to edit:</p>  <pre><code>-rw-r--r-- 1 &lt;username&gt; &lt;username&gt; 130782 Sep 28 14:41 newfile.txt </code></pre>  <p>I did set the permission on folder and subfiles and subfolders to 777 (for testing), but when I create the textfile it gets 644. But I've changed the permissions the textfile to 777 aswell, I still can`t delete it.</p>
