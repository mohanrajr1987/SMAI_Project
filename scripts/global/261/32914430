<p>I am working on a ftp webapp. I have created everything till uploading part, i.e, File is successfully uploaded into ftpuser's directory. Now I am providing users option to see files they uploaded by format. Example: if users clicks on icon of browse images then they should be shown all the images they have uploaded.</p>  <p>Commands like "Retr" starts downloading files other than texts and pdf but I want to enlist all the files and not download. I have no idea about how to do this.</p>  <p>I am using Flask for webapp and ftplib for uploading.</p>
