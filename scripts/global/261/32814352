<p>As the title says, I'm trying to upload a picture from my application but I need to upload many with all different names (eg: PicJ8S23D.png) but I cannot figure it out...</p>  <p>The problem: I made a random string which 'would' create PicJ8S23D.png <em>but</em> when I try to upload it I'm unable to find the file (because I'm searching for a file that doesn't exist(because I just randomized the name.))</p>  <p>(I'm taking a picture in .bmp format first thats why I convert it at the bottom.)</p>  <pre><code>private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) {     System.Drawing.Image image = System.Drawing.Image.FromFile("Pic.bmp");     image.Save("Pic"+ RandomString1(5) +".png", System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageFormat.Png);     UploadImage("ftp://example.com", "uname", "pword", "pic"+ RandomString1(5) +".png"); } </code></pre>
