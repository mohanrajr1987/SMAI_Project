<p>I am quite new at using the ftp class provided in .net but i wrote this code piece of code to get file from an ftp server.i just want to be  sure that this would always timeout when i call it in the given time and never run for infinite amount of time.I have done a lot of test like breaking the connection in between and lot of other stuff.but i still wanted advice on this. </p>  <pre><code> /// &lt;summary&gt;     /// gets the file from the given remote location     /// &lt;/summary&gt;     /// &lt;exception cref="System.Net.WebException"&gt;throws this when user name is incorrect or connection is lost&lt;/exception&gt;     /// &lt;param name="remoteLocation"&gt;this is the relative path of the file.This paths includes the file name eg: "/test/test.txt"&lt;/param&gt;     /// &lt;returns&gt;returns a bite [].Check for null before using the byte[]&lt;/returns&gt;     public  byte[] getFile(string remoteLocation)     {         Stream reader = null;         MemoryStream memoryStream = null;         FtpWebResponse response = null;          try         {             FtpWebRequest request = (FtpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create("ftp://" + this.ipAddress + remoteLocation);             request.Method = WebRequestMethods.Ftp.DownloadFile;             request.Timeout = timeOut;             request.Credentials = new NetworkCredential(this.username, this.password);             response = (FtpWebResponse)request.GetResponse();             reader = response.GetResponseStream();             memoryStream = new MemoryStream();             reader.ReadTimeout = timeOut;             reader.CopyTo(memoryStream);             return memoryStream.ToArray();           }          catch (Exception e)         {              throw e;         }         finally         {             if (response != null)             {                 response.Close();             }             if (memoryStream != null)             {                 memoryStream.Close();             }             if (reader != null)             {                 reader.Close();             }          }       } </code></pre>  <p>please let me know if this is not an appropriate question to ask here.i will delete it in that case.And where should i ask it then?</p>
