<p>My requirement is to FTping the CSV file to Mainframe dataset uisng java code.Below code is working perfectly. But when i try to transfer file to mainframe GDG (Generation Data Groups) like 'FTPAA.TEST.BBBB.DLY(+1)'. Its not working. Is there any specific settings need to do in FTPClient to transfer file to GDG?</p>  <p></p>  <pre><code>File file = new File("abc.csv"); String testName = "FTPAA.TEST"; fis = new FileInputStream(file);  // Upload file to the ftp server try{     result = ftpclient.storeFile(testName, fis); } </code></pre>
