<p>Okey I know there are a bunch of other questions like this and I have read them but I just cant get this to work. Here is my scenario: Ppl upload video files to the ftp. Every 10 second I have a cron job that run ffmpeg commands on video files in the ftp folder. But the ffmpeg commands will fail because the whole file has not yet been uploaded. So I need one way to as exact as possible check if the file has been completely uploaded.</p>
