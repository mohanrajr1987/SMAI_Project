<p>I have a website that has a video background on it's homepage. The video get's fetched from the folder 'videowall'. The live version of the site doesn't play the video and I get 'Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)' in the developer tools window. I checked the root folder of the FTP server and the folder was there. </p>  <p>The portion of the code that plays the video :</p>  <pre><code>            &lt;video preload="auto" autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" volume="0" poster="~/video/oranges.jpg" muted="muted"&gt;             &lt;source src="/videowall/pete.mp4" type="video/mp4" /&gt;             &lt;%--&lt;source src="~/video/oranges.webm" type="video/webm" /&gt;--%&gt;             &lt;source src="/videowall/pete.ogv" type="video/ogg" /&gt;         &lt;/video&gt; </code></pre>  <p>The path of the file is relative to the root directory. Why is the FTP server not able to find it?</p>
