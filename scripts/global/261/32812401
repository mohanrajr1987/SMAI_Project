<p>I have AlwaysON setup in an Azure environment. I was hoping that I could use the listener as my FTP IP address using FileZilla Server/Client. It actually works in regards to using the IP address but when I do a manual fail-over and connect via the client the files get transferred to Node 1 (now secondary) instead of Node 2 (now primary). </p>  <p>I know that I can use an external server for FTP and read from a UNC file path within the same data center but I am also in the process of configuring DR and having another Replica added to the Availability Group and if we do have an event that would trigger a DR fail-over, I could still use the listener IP and it would be transparent to all our FTP clients.</p>
