<p>I'm using FTP server to upload images for a social networking app. due to limitations of server with shared host. i've no problem with uploading, is there any way to download images from FTP Server, via HTTP ? because downloading each image on local storage first will be devastatingly slow and inefficient. And any suggestion about efficiency and memory management will be appreciated.</p>
