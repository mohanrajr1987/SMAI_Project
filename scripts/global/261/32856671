<p>We have a crontab script on UNIX that is using for downloading file from the ftp server, but it was sometimes work perfectly and sometimes work badly(a few file cannot be downloaded), another thing is I'm pretty sure the files are already located on the ftp server, so far my only solution is to run it manually from the cmd line, and it's always work perfectly.</p>  <p>Does anyone have any idea what might be the cause of this problem? </p>  <pre><code>30 00 * * * batch/ftp_downloader.sh APPLE 30 00 * * * batch/ftp_downloader.sh ORANGE 30 00 * * * batch/ftp_downloader.sh PEAR </code></pre>
