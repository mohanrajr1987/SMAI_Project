<p>I have created a /beta/ version of my website and when I am happy with the site in /beta/ I transfer it to the home directory. I do this manually now but I was wondering if their is an easier way to download only files recently modified in the beta folder so I can upload them to the home directory.  I am using Filezilla </p>
