<p>I am port forwarding an FTP and XAMPP server on my home computer. Today, I tried to transfer a MathJax folder (more than 30000 files) using DreamWeaver's put command on FTP and it took nearly an hour. </p>  <p>I have seen on the internet that many servers, especially search engines, combine the processing power of multiple machines as well as their memory to create a more powerful server. I currently have two computers I would like to try this on, but I do not know how it would be possible when I am not actually buying a server space. </p>  <p>Is it more costly to sync files between these machines as well as use their combined capabilities to host my server, or can I actually do this and get some benefit? If so, how? Thanks!</p>
