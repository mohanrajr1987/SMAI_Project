<p>i have a problem with this domain that i got from a friend, which is:  www.ortica.org The problem i have is that whenever i visit the site, it redirects me here: <a href="http://www.ortica.org/ortica_2/ortica_2_home.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ortica.org/ortica_2/ortica_2_home.html</a></p>  <p>it looks like that the last address gets used as homepage ... i'd like to know how to change it (and where to change it) to disable the redirecting thing.</p>  <p>p.s. it give a 404 because i'm trying to clean the domain and start from 0...</p>
