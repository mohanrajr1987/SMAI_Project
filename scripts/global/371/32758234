<p>When I use both ghci with <code>-fobject-code</code> and command-line ghc, code is compiled fully when switching from one to the other. For example, when I work interactively in Emacs using haskell inferior mode configured to use <code>cabal repl</code>, code loads and compiles fine. Then I do a <code>cabal build</code> and same code is recompiled. </p>  <p>How can I prevent this double compilation assuming <code>-fobject-code</code> in ghci actually uses the same kind of binary format than ghc does?</p>
