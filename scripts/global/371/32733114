<p>I'm having some trouble getting emacs to recognise the fact that I have <code>compass</code> installed. After following <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/15591530/1351298">this answer</a> to get compass to compile my project; <code>scss-mode</code> in Emacs still gives me the error in the title.</p>  <p>All I have right now is this:</p>  <pre><code>@import "compass/css3/box-sizing";  div {   @include box-sizing(border-box); } </code></pre>  <p>As I wanted to test out compass before starting to use it for real.</p>  <p>Does anyone know how I can resolve this problem?</p>  <p>I use</p>  <ul> <li>Compass v. 1.0.3 (Polaris)</li> <li>Sass v. 3.4.18 (Selective Steve)</li> <li>Emacs v. 24.5.1</li> <li>scss-mode v. 0.5.0</li> </ul>
