<p>I am new to emacs and have never used package-install before. I am using emacs 24.4 on Windows, but I would like to do the same thing on my emacs installed ona unix server that I ssh into.</p>  <p>These <a href="https://github.com/auto-complete/auto-complete" rel="nofollow">instructions</a> say that I can install <code>auto-complete</code> with <code>M-x package-install [RET] auto-complete [RET]</code>, but when I do this I get <code>[No match]</code>. Why is this? How can I install it?</p>
