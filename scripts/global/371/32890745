<p>I recently discovered flycheck and am excited to get it working. It seems to work fine with code I've written all by myself but I have behavior I can't explain using printf. With the following code:</p>  <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;  int main() {     printf("hello world\n"); } </code></pre>  <p>The printf gets underlined and flycheck-list-errors reports "use of undeclared identifier 'printf' ... (c/c++-clang).</p>  <p>I'm fairly certain it's finding stdio.h (since that's not underlined), but I'm not sure why printf remains undefined. </p>  <p>Potentially of note: the code compiles fine with <code>clang++ -o main main.cpp</code></p>  <p>Any help would be much appreciated.</p>
