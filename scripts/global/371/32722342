<p>When I launch emacs through "sudo emacs" from terminal in my Ubuntu system,I got the following warning message:</p>  <pre><code>gary@gary-Acer:~$ sudo emacs  (emacs:2172): GLib-WARNING **: In call to g_spawn_sync(),  exit status of a child process was requested but ECHILD was received by waitpid(). Most likely the process is ignoring SIGCHLD, or some other thread is invoking waitpid() with a nonpositive first argument;  either behavior can break applications that use g_spawn_sync either directly or indirectly. </code></pre>  <p>But if I type"emacs"(not "sudo emacs") in the terminal ,everything is ok! I had done as <a href="https://bleedux.wordpress.com/2011/01/05/glib-warning-gconf-error-when-launching-emacs/" rel="nofollow">this page</a>,and the content of /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc is as follows:</p>  <pre><code>#!/bin/sh xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap 2&gt;/dev/null exec dbus-launch --exit-with-session ck-launch-session openbox-session # /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc # # global xinitrc file, used by all X sessions started by xinit (startx)  # invoke global X session script . /etc/X11/Xsession </code></pre>
