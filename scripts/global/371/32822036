<p>How to kill all buffers with buffer file in a certain location?</p>  <p>For example, I want kill all buffers with buffer file in c:...\dev and all dired buffer subdir to c:...\dev</p>  <p>Or in others words, how to go though the files or dirs of all buffers in emacs?</p>  <p>Thanks @David @phils. I combined the elisp code and function in ibuffer</p>  <pre><code>(mapc (lambda (buffer)     (let ((file-name            (or (buffer-file-name buffer)                (with-current-buffer buffer                  (and                   (boundp 'dired-directory)                   (stringp dired-directory)                   dired-directory))                )))       (when (and file-name                  (string-match "^c:.*?\\\\dev" file-name))         (kill-buffer buffer))))   (buffer-list)) </code></pre>
