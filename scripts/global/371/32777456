<p>I'm setting up Emacs, and I'm trying to install csharp-mode for it. I have the .el file located in: <code>~/.emacs.d/plugins</code>, but according to <a href="https://github.com/josteink/csharp-mode#usage" rel="nofollow">The Github page, it should automatically load after package-install csharp-mode, which it doesn't.</a></p>  <p><code>Symbol's function definition is void: set-difference</code> - is the whole message I get when I try to eval-buffer with <code>require 'csharp-mode</code>. Anyone got any idea why this doesn't work?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/0ZVcC.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/0ZVcC.png" alt="Screenshot of Emacs"></a></p>
