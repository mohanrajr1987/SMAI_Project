<p>I'm using helm-mode in emacs to open files. However, when I try to copy the path of a file (say /home/user1/Documents/file1.txt) through mouse left-click and hold to paste it in terminal, I get a message saying</p>  <p><code>&lt;down-mouse-1&gt; is undefined</code></p>  <p>I guess helm does not support mouse operations as described <a href="http://%20github.com/emacs-helm/helm/issues/501#issuecomment-140496283." rel="nofollow">here</a>, in which case how can I copy path of a file from emacs (in helm-mode) to paste it in terminal</p>
