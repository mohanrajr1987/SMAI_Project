<p>In Emacs, everything seems to work quite well regarding UTF-8.  The problem is, I sometimes want to print out an email containing Unicode characters (I use mu4e as my MUA).</p>  <p>I'll typically have something like the following in a <code>mu4e:view</code> buffer:</p>  <pre><code>    From: A Person     To: Me     Subject: Notes on Chapter 9     Date: Tue 22 Sep 2015 13:46:44 CEST     Maildir: /mymaildir/INBOX     User-agent: Gnus/5.13 (Gnus v5.13) Emacs/24.5 (gnu/linux)        • “for open platforms” -&gt; “for \textit{open platforms}, as defined in         [123].  Such platforms include frobbing devices and home-assistant         foobars.” </code></pre>  <p>The problem is, when I do <code>M-x</code> <code>ps-print-buffer</code>, the physical output on paper looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>    ...        ? ?for open platforms? -&gt; ?for \textit{open platforms}, as defined in         [123].  Such platforms include frobbing devices and home-assistant         foobars.? </code></pre>  <p>Does anybody know how I can print so that it looks the same as on my screen?  After some Startpaging/DuckDuckGoing I haven't managed to find any pointers.</p>
