<p>I have only recently started to use emacs. I have succesffully used a couple of different themes, but am having trouble getting <a href="https://github.com/purcell/color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow" rel="nofollow">Tomorrow</a> to work.</p>  <p>Here's what I have done:</p>  <p>The .el files are in ~/.emacs.d/themes/</p>  <p>my-init.el:</p>  <pre><code>(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.emacs.d/themes/") (require 'color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow) (load-theme 'color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow-night t) </code></pre>  <p>I load this in .emacs by doing</p>  <pre><code>(add-hook 'after-init-hook '(lambda ()                   (load "~/.emacs.d/my-noexternals.el")                   (load "~/.emacs.d/my-init.el") )) </code></pre>  <p>When I reload emacs I see <code>eval-buffer: Cannot open load file: no such file or directory, color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow</code>.</p>
