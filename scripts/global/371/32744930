<p>I am trying to set [Inconsolata-dz][1] as my default font to Emacs. Regular Inconsolata works fine, but the dz version is not working properly. Most functions I use keep throwing this error (followed all the instructions online on how to set Emacs font):</p>  <p><code>set-face-attribute: Invalid font name: "-*-Inconsolata-dz-normal-normal-normal-*-13-*-*-*-m-0-iso10646-1" </code></p>  <p>I finally got it to work by doing this in my <code>init.el</code>:</p>  <pre><code>(setq initial-frame-alist '((font . "Inconsolata-dz-13"))) (setq default-frame-alist '((font . "Inconsolata-dz-13"))) </code></pre>  <p>I also have this in <code>init.el</code>, which was generated by <code>customize-faces</code>, but it seems to change the font to Helvetica (unless overridden by the code above):</p>  <pre><code>(custom-set-variables  ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.  ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.  ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.  ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.  '(custom-safe-themes    (quote     ("e16a771a13a202ee6e276d06098bc77f008b73bbac4d526f160faa2d76c1dd0e"      "d677ef584c6dfc0697901a44b885cc18e206f05114c8a3b7fde674fce6180879"      "8aebf25556399b58091e533e455dd50a6a9cba958cc4ebb0aab175863c25b9a4"      default))))  (custom-set-faces  ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom.  ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.  ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.  ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.  '(default ((t (:inherit nil :stipple nil :inverse-video nil              :box nil :strike-through nil :overline nil              :underline nil :slant normal              :weight normal :height 140 :width normal              :foundry "nil" :family "Inconsolata-dz"))))) </code></pre>  <p>Now the issue with the first code above is that doing a <code>Ctrl+N</code>, to create a new window will throw the same Invalid font name error.</p>  <p>I installed Inconsolata and Inconsolata-dz the same way on my Mac. Just the regular, default way of installing fonts on OS X.</p>  <p>Does anyone know what I'm doing wrong and how I can use Inconsolata-dz properly?</p>
