<p>I just upgraded to latest version of ESS using package manager for Ubuntu 12.04.   Emacs alone seems to work fine, but Emacs does not work with ESS (Emacs Speaks Statistics).  Upon start up of ESS, I get the message:</p>  <p>Error in post-command-hook: (error Autoloading failed to define function compilation--ensure-parse).</p>  <p>How can I fix this?</p>  <p>Below is my rather brief .emacs file:</p>  <pre><code>(custom-set-variables   ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.   ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.   ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.   ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
