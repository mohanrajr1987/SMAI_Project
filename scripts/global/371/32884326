<p>I have been looking for how to use emacs and found many interesting video about how to use emacs or how good emacs is. But I am note quite sure what is the difference among <strong>emacs</strong>, <strong>emacs evil mode</strong> or <strong>emacs org mode</strong>. And what is the metric to chose which of those <strong>emacs</strong> for your editor tools. I know there are <strong>emacs</strong> experts out here and hope you can give some good information for <strong>emacs</strong> beginners.</p>
