<p>I want to remove a tag from multiple entries at once.  It is the same tag on each of the entries.</p>  <p>I know how to show the entries with that tag.  I can "mark" some of them in the agenda view.  Now how can I remove a tag from all the marked ones?</p>  <p>BACKGROUND:</p>  <p>I have to do a release every little while.  I add a "RELEASE" tag to the TODO items that need to be done for that release.  When the release is ... released, then I need to untag all those entries and start over with keeping track of features for the next release.</p>  <p>I'd like to untag all those entries marked RELEASE in one shot, instead of visiting 15 or 20 items one by one and removing this RELEASE tag.</p>  <p>I haven't been able to find any documentation on what to do with this marking of the agenda items.  I discovered it by accident, maybe I am misunderstanding what it is for?</p>
