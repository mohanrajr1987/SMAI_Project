<p>I'm using <code>linum</code> to show line numbers. What I want is to have them enabled by default, but disabled in certain major modes, like eshell, compilation, etc.</p>  <p><a href="http://emacswiki.org/emacs/LineNumbers#toc7" rel="nofollow">This</a> works well, but what I can't figure out is how to disable them in Helm buffers.</p>  <ul> <li>There doesn't seem to be a major mode I can hook into</li> <li><code>(add-hook 'helm-before-initialize-hook '(lambda () (linum-mode 0)))</code> turns off line numbers globally. Not sure how to disable <code>linum</code> for the current buffer only, since Helm buffers usually appear alongside another one</li> <li>Tried advice around <code>helm-find-files</code>, but doesn't seem to work</li> </ul>
