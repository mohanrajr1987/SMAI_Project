<p>I am finally getting close to a nice emacs environment, based off of <a href="https://github.com/AndreaCrotti/minimal-emacs-configuration/blob/master/init.el" rel="nofollow">this</a> baseline. However, many of the python-emacs tutorials mention things like "<code>C-c C-c</code> to run this in a python shell", or "<code>C-c !</code>" to launch a python shell". For some reason I am not getting this functionality. I am getting <code>C-c C-c is undefined</code>. What does work is <code>M-x run-python</code>.</p>  <p>Why am I not getting the standard behavior? I am running emacs through cygwin, which has both python and ipython installed.</p>
