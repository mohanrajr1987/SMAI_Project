<p>When adding a divider in code I can easily repeat a '=' N times using</p>  <p><code>C-&lt;N&gt; =</code></p>  <p>where N is the number of equal signs to insert.</p>  <p>Is there a similarly quick command that would insert a character repeatedly up to a given column number?  So I could execute</p>  <p><code>&lt;magic command&gt;-&lt;N&gt; =</code></p>  <p>and get a line of equal signs from the present cursor position to column N?</p>
