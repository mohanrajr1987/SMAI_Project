<p>I'm trying to finally bite the bullet and learn emacs. Mainly so that I am comfortable editing files on a server through ssh. So I installed emacs on Windows in order practice. Right away I noticed this difference: when I press <code>ctrl - rightarrow</code> on windows, the cursor jumps to the next work. When I do this in emacs on the server, the cursor moves to the next character only. I believe the latter is the "normal" behaviour (<code>M - rightarrow</code> will jump to the next word in both versions). How can I get my windows emacs to behave exactly like the one on the server? I don't want to learn habits on windows that won't carry over to the server.</p>
