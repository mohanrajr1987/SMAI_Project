<p>I was switching to line mode fine in my <code>ansi-term</code> by using <code>C-c C-j</code> - I must have inadvertently toggled something but now when I hit <code>C-c</code> it immediately sends an interrupt to the term so I can't switch to line mode. Is this something I could have triggered easily or can toggle? (Like, accidentally setting goal column). All the answers I find modify .emacs which I didn't do.</p>  <p>*I just noticed that I can access line mode with <code>C-x C-j</code> and return to char mode with <code>C-c C-k</code> but I'd prefer to use <code>C-c C-j</code> and require <code>C-c C-c</code> for an interrupt - what could have changed this so sporadically?</p>
