<p>I'm not sure what the normal behaviour is here, but I would like to have multiple workgroups, each with its associated buffers. So, for example, I could have <code>my-python-workgroup</code> which has a bunch of python files open in the buffer, and a <code>my-ssh-workgroup</code> which has buffers associated with a server connection.</p>  <p>Right now it seems like once I launch emacs and switch between workgroups, my buffers end up accumulating. Is there any way to keep buffers separate?</p>
