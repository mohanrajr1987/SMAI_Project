<p>So I'm trying to add something into some elisp mode hooks â€” specifically, I'd like to define a hook's <code>prettify-symbols-alist</code> and then specifically activate it by calling <code>prettify-symbols-mode</code>. </p>  <p>In any case, I'm getting <code>org-babel</code> to export the values into a pair of lists from a table, using <code>pairlis</code> to tie them together as an alist, and <code>add-hook</code> it into the desired mode using a anonymous function.</p>  <p>So, the thing is, right now if I use a global variable, like the following, it works:</p>  <pre><code>(let ((token (quote ("not" "*" "/" "-&gt;" "map" "/=" "&lt;=" "&gt;=" "lambda")))       (code (quote (172 215 247 8594 8614 8800 8804 8805 955)))) ; Generated automatically using org-babel    (require 'cl)    (setq *globalvar (pairlis token code))    (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook             (lambda ()                (setq prettify-symbols-alist *globalvar)                (prettify-symbols-mode 1)))) </code></pre>  <p>But if I try to not use a global variable, by doing it this way, it doesn't work:</p>  <pre><code>(let ((token (quote ("not" "*" "/" "-&gt;" "map" "/=" "&lt;=" "&gt;=" "lambda")))       (code (quote (172 215 247 8594 8614 8800 8804 8805 955)))) ; Generated automatically using org-babel   (let (localv)     (require 'cl)      (setq localv (pairlis token code))      (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook               (lambda ()                  (setq prettify-symbols-alist localv)                  (prettify-symbols-mode 1)))) </code></pre>  <p>I kind of know why: if I <code>C-h v emacs-lisp-mode-hook</code>, I'll see that it refers to whatever variable I used in the <code>let</code> form, which works when the variable exists, as in <code>*globalvar</code>, but not when I use <code>localvar</code>, which no longer exists outside of its <code>let</code> form. But I'm not sure how to force evaluation of the local variable itself, as I'm still struggling with a lot of concepts in elisp that aren't immediately clear to me.</p>  <p>What am I missing? Where am I going wrong here?</p>
