<p>Sorry for a very-newbie question... I'm begining to use Emacs with slime-sbcl and i'd like the syntax highlight feature to highlight the comparison operators (&lt;,>,>=,&lt;=, etc), as well as other keywords (setq, lenght, etc).</p>  <p>I've read many examples of <strong>font-lock-add-keywords</strong> but I somehow I can't get it done. Can anybody show me a concrete example of this?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance...</p>
