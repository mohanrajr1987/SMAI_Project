<p>I upgraded to El Capitan and now Haskell in emacs is no longer working. I got ghc working in the terminal as well as cabal. However, it was recommended to use homebrew for ghc and when I do the following:</p>  <pre><code>brew install ghc </code></pre>  <p>I get the following warning:</p>  <pre><code>Warning: ghc-7.10.2 already installed, it's just not linked </code></pre>  <p>Furthermore, when I try loading in emacs it says the following</p>  <pre><code>searching for program: no such file or directory, cabal </code></pre>  <p>And then when the interpreter loads, it doesn't let me hit RETURN key</p>
