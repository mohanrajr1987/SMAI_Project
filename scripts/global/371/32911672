<p>For the LIFE of me I can't figure out why emacs indents lines in *.cmake files with 2 spaces per indent rather than what the Standard Indent is set to in customize. I also have <code>c-basic-offset</code> set to 4. I can't find anything with apropos help, google, <code>C-h C-m</code>...</p>  <p>EVERYTHING ELSE works with indentation spacing of 4 -- python, c++, etc. Why does cmake indent to 2 spaces while everything else does 4? How can I change it back to use 4 spaces?</p>
