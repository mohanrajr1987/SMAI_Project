<p>With <code>emacs</code>, when one types <code>ctrl+x+s</code> (or <code>Cmnd+s</code>) but no changes need to be saved one gets the message: </p>  <pre><code>(No changes need to be saved) </code></pre>  <p>Also, when undoing changes and you get to the 1st change made in that session, one gets the message:</p>  <pre><code>No further undo information </code></pre>  <p>I was wondering if (and how) is possible to set these messages when using sublime text 3.</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
