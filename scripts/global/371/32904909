<p>I use EMACS/AucTeX. In order to compile I do C-c C-c, then it asks</p>  <p>"Command: (default LaTeX)" </p>  <p>I press RET and it is compiled. To view the compiled document I do C-c C-v.</p>  <p>I would like to have a simple shortcut, like pressing F1 or some other key combination to compile and then view the document. There is any simple command/function that can be inserted in .emacs to do that?</p>  <p>Thanks Pietro</p>
