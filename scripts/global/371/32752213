<p>Sometimes in emacs I stop being able to send <strong>return</strong> in term, at prompts. A restart fixes it, but it is very frustrating. Virtualenv going, all the buffers I need open, and I'm cooking away. Then I try <code>rm file</code>, and I can't push <strong>y</strong> then <strong>return</strong>. I just get <strong>^M</strong>. I know <strong>enter</strong> send <strong>c-M</strong> in Emacs, but I can't sort out why this works for a while, then stops.</p>  <p>Obviously in this example I can just <code>rm -rf file</code>, but that isn't always the case.</p>
