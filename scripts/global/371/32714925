<p>I have several source file which have function definitions as follows.</p>  <pre><code>ReturnType ClassName:: FunctionName(FunctionArgs...) {  .... }  ReturnType ClassName::NestedClassName:: FunctionName(FunctionArgs...) {  .... } </code></pre>  <p>I want to grep through the files and list all the functions of first type sepeartely and second type separately. Is there a way to do it in emacs? Note: I have tried C-q C-j from [<a href="http://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/9548/what-is-regex-to-match-newline-character]">http://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/9548/what-is-regex-to-match-newline-character]</a>. it didn't work.</p>
