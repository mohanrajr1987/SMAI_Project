<p>I've been looking at <a href="http://www.raywenderlich.com/94443/uisplitviewcontroller-tutorial-getting-started" rel="nofollow">this UISplitViewController example</a>. And it's great but I have several changes that I would like to make to have result more like Messenger or Skype but I don't know how to make them yet. </p>  <p>I've added <code>UITabBarController</code> as root controller for navigation controller which is master controller. One of tab items is original controller with <code>TableView</code>. If you want here is <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9DXnv0Zuj9TeFdYX0R1MFU4LUE/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">my modified code</a>.</p>  <ol> <li>How can I set that the first controller to show should be master?</li> <li>Can I set iPad portrait to always visible master controller side-by-side with detail controller without option to hide it? I tried change <code>UISplitViewControllerDisplayMode</code> to <code>AllVisible</code> and it shows master next to detail but it is possible to hide master page and that's what I don't want.</li> <li>When I tried change display mode to AllVisible it changes behavior of landscape iPad too. Now I was enabled to hide master controller too. Why is that? Can I fix it somehow that iPad landscape would act same for AllVisible as for Automatic?</li> </ol>  <p>Thanks for help</p>
