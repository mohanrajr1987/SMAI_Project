<p>I want to change the appearance of the UISearchController and its components.</p>  <p>I am fine with the text field and its color, but I want to control the colors of:</p>  <pre><code>1. search and scope bar background color (currently default is gray) 2. color of text in scope bar (both selected and unselected) 3. color of borders of scope bar 4. color of inside of the scope bar (both selected and unselected) </code></pre>  <p>Thanks.</p>
