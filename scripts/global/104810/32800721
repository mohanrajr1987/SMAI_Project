<p>I've been looking for this for a long time. What i need is basically to add memory to a button (Back Button). What i already have is 2 main viewControllers. In the first one i have a <strong>SQL</strong> that has 3 actions (all 3 in the same viewController). The third action takes you to the last Controller (second one), there is all the information you are looking for.</p>  <p><strong>My Problem is that in the second controller the back button doesn't have memory so if you press it it takes you to the first step of the data base instead of taking you to the last one (the one you were before) so you have to make the process completely again.</strong></p>  <p><strong>Basically when you go form the second controller to de first controller it doesn't take you to where you where, it takes you to the first step of the dataBase</strong></p>  <p>I'll leave some screenshots of the app so you can get better what im trying to do.</p>  <p>I really need to fix that so ill be very grateful if you could please help me with some codes.</p>
