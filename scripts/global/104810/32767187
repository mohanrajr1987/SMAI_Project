<p>I have developed an app using Xcode 6, it runs well till iOS8, but I want it to run on iOS9 too. So, will it work if I submit the the app onto the Appstore right away, or should I download Xcode 7 and rebuild it..and then upload it to the app store..? What should I do..? Please help me out..! Thanks in advance.</p>
