<p>I have an SKShapeNode drawn on my scene with a CGPath. The strokeTexture is simply a circle. On iOS8 it works perfectly. In iOS9 However it doesn't work at all unless I remove the texture part.  Here is my code:</p>  <pre><code>    SKTexture *pathTexture = [AtlasHelper getTexture:@"circle.png" fromAtlas:@"Common"];     UIBezierPath *path = [UIBezierPath interpolateCGPointsWithHermite:pointsArray closed:NO];     SKShapeNode *shape = [SKShapeNode shapeNodeWithPath:[path CGPath]];     shape.strokeTexture = pathTexture;     [shape setStrokeColor:[UIColor whiteColor]];     shape.lineWidth = 20;     shape.zPosition = zOrderAbovePopUps;     [self addChild:shape]; </code></pre>  <p>Notes: 1.Remove strokeTexture solves it but the path is being drawn without the texture (which is what I need) 2.Remove the stroke colour doesn't change anything 3.The result of this code is just a weird, blurry point :(</p>  <p>Help me please.</p>  <p>Thank you</p>
