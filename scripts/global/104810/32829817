<p>I recently updated to xCode 7 which uses iOS 9 and when I run the following app, the location is supposed to print to the console but that's not happening.</p>  <p>The app will build successfully, the map displays, but the location data doesn't print. Even if the move the map, it still doesn't print.</p>  <p>The code should be correct, i've imported all of the necessary frameworks and set both the NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription &amp; NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription in the Info.plist file along w/ their values.</p>  <p>Below is the code:</p>  <pre><code>//  ViewController.swift //  Maps iOS9 // //  Created by Alex Ngounou on 9/28/15. //  Copyright Â© 2015 Alex Ngounou.
