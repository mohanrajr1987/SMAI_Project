<p>I am aware of adding image as background to Tableview header and also its rows, but I am facing problem in adding a single image as background to section header and also its following rows.</p>  <p>I tried in may ways but didn't get a proper solution.I know we can do it using scrollview but it will become complex as the number of sections and rows increases.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Rd8Tt.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Rd8Tt.png" alt="enter image description here"></a> </p>  <p>In the above image, India is header and hyderabad etc are the cities related to that header.Check only single background image added here. If any one had done this kind of design, please share your suggestions or ideas.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
