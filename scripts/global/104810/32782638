<p>It there any reproducible way to run a debug build compiled with iOS 8 SDK on an iOS 9 device?</p>  <p>Xcode usually tells me that the device's iOS is not supported by that version of Xcode. BUT I have managed to run on the same device with the same SDK via AppCode - unfortunately it does not work everytime, but in very rare cases. In these cases even break points worked fine. Also when distributing an app for testing, it is no problem to install an app built with the iOS 8 SDK on a device running iOS 9.</p>  <p>So how can we properly debug that case?</p>
