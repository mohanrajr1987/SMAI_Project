<p>I am trying to make an input accessory view with voice input like whatsapp or iMessage app. I am using AVAudioRecorder for recording voice. But it's confusing where to add voice input button's action method and how to link it to the view controller. I am using custom class for for my input accessory view. I do not have nib and I dont know how should I pass a action method from customInputAccessoryView Class to the view controller </p>
