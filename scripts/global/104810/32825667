<p>As part of implementing a 'private mode' feature for a browser that utilizes WKWebView, I want to clear any media that was playing while viewing 'private' content. The idea is that when I background the app, I want to make sure whatever video/audio I was listening to that originated from this WKWebView instance doesn't leak and appear in the iOS control center. I've tried to use MPNowPlayingInfoCenter to set the control center's in progress information to nil but it doesn't seem to be doing anything. I found a related question on SO as well that seems to say that this might not be possible: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30029338/overriding-mpnowplayinginfocenter-while-using-wkwebview">Overriding MPNowPlayingInfoCenter while using WKWebView</a> .</p>  <p>Anyone have any ideas of other APIs or getting access to WKWebView's media player to have some control over how I can reset the control center's playing information when the application goes into the background?</p>
