<p>I've recently updated Xcode to 7 so I could start developing against iOS 9.  Upon first launching my application, I noticed that the screen size/scale is off compared to how it looks on iOS 8, both on the iPhone 6 device.</p>  <p>Here is how it looks correct on iOS 8:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/CP6PWTA.png" rel="nofollow">http://i.imgur.com/CP6PWTA.png</a></p>  <p>Here is how it looks incorrect on iOS 9:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/zDj1MQb.png" rel="nofollow">http://i.imgur.com/zDj1MQb.png</a></p>  <p>If you also notice, both of those images are the same exact size.</p>  <p>Note how the AdMob banner has white space on the left/right, I'm assuming AdMob just knows to center it.  Also the big white space to the right of the table view and the button down on the bottom.</p>  <p>Also, when in iOS 8, and putting a break point in the main delegate method, the main window has a frame of (0 0; 320 568).  The layer on the window is also the same.</p>  <p>On the flip side, when in iOS 9, and putting a break point in the main delegate method, the main window has a frame of (0 0; 375 667).  The layer on the window is also the same.</p>  <p>That explains why the difference in the look of the app in iOS 8 vs. iOS 9, but I do not know why iOS 8 looks the way I want it to and iOS 9 doesn't.  Is there some setting that I'm missing?</p>  <p>EDIT:</p>  <p>I've also since figured out that the bounds of the mainScreen is different between when this runs in iOS 8 vs. iOS 9.  The screenBounds of the mainScreen is set to the same frame as up above, and I have no clue why it is different between the two iOS versions.</p>  <p>EDIT 2:</p>  <p>So I just created a brand new project and tested this out.  I do not get the same behavior as explained up above in my first edit.  When I view the mainScreen bounds, in both iOS 8 and iOS 9, it is (0,0;375,667);</p>  <p>I just cannot figure out what is causing this to happen so I can fix it.</p>  <p>EDIT 3:</p>  <p>After toying around quite a bit last night, it turns out that the launch images are causing this to happen.  If I remove the launch images of Default-568@2x.png from the list, then it displays properly.  Very odd that something like this can effect the scale.  I still didn't figure out how to solve this yet though because you have to have launch images or apple will reject the app, so I'm keeping this open until I have more time tonight to toy around with it.</p>
