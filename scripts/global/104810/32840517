<p>I realized that iOS9 adds a line break after the attachment when trying to send a SMS with <code>MFMessageComposeViewController</code>.</p>  <p>It's a problem as our SMS receiver is parsing the input characters to route it to an the correct mail inbox. We're using a text prefix, and it's not working.</p>  <p>It works perfectly fine in iOS 8. Snippet below where the problem occurs.</p>  <pre><code>combined = @"ABC TIPS"; messageVC.recipients = @"123456789"; messageVC.messageComposeDelegate = self; [messageVC setBody:combined];  UIImage *myImage = image; NSData *imgData = UIImagePNGRepresentation(myImage);  if (image != NULL){     // Present message view controller on screen     [messageVC addAttachmentData:imgData typeIdentifier:@"public.png" filename:@"image.png"];      [self presentViewController:messageVC animated:YES completion:nil]; } </code></pre>  <p>In iOS8 the message is composed in to: attachment - body</p>  <p>But iOS9 seems to compose it to: attachment - new line - body</p>  <p>I want to remove the "new line" part... Any takes on what we can do (besides rewriting in to not use SMS)?</p>
