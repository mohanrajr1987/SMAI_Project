<p>How can I provide our customers a J2ME App for Nokia devices with an expired (code signing) certificate? I can't renew it because the CA refuses to deliver a new SHA1 certificate because SHA1 is obsolete. I also can't use SHA2 because the old nokia devices don't support SHA2 (Nokia 206, Nokia 301, Nokia 2700c). What sould I do? Our customers can't download our software anymore!</p>
