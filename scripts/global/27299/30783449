<p>A provider is developing an android application and told me that SHA2 is not supported because they are using J2ME. Is this really true? I did some google searching and didn't find anything about this.</p>  <p>Another thing that worry me is that they are using J2ME to develop an Android application. Is this a good idea? Isn't more secure to develop using native Android and not Java Microedition?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>  <p>Best!</p>
