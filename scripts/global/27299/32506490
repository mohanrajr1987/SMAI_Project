<p>I am using Eclipse Juno and <code>Jre7</code>. I'm also using <code>Java ME SDK 3.0</code> and I have tried <code>Java ME 8.1</code> too. </p>  <p>I have all the <code>JAR</code> files I need. The project works in a normal Java Project. But <code>midlet</code> project is creating the problem. So, the problem is not with the <code>JRE</code> or <code>eclipse</code>. It has something to do with <code>midlet</code> project. Could anyone tell me what could be the reason ? Is there a way to remove these errors ?</p>  <p>This is the error:</p>  <pre><code>java.lang.String Error preverifying class java.lang.String </code></pre>
