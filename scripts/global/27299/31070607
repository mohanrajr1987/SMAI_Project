<p>I'm translating a Java (JDK 1.5) "enum" into Java ME (JDK 1.4).</p>  <p>Many people have suggested retroweaver to parse JDK 1.5 libraries to JDK 1.4 but I've got a lot of problems using it and I really want to get full control of my project due the HW limitations.</p>  <p>What's the best way to translate it or find an equivalent?</p>  <pre><code>/**   Authentication enumerates the authentication levels. */ public enum Authentication {     /**       No authentication is used.     */     NONE,     /**       Low authentication is used.     */     LOW,     /**       High authentication is used.     */     HIGH,     /*      * High authentication is used. Password is hashed with MD5.      */     HIGH_MD5,     /*      * High authentication is used. Password is hashed with SHA1.      */     HIGH_SHA1,     /*      * High authentication is used. Password is hashed with GMAC.      */     HIGH_GMAC;      /*      * Get integer value for enum.      */     public int getValue()     {         return this.ordinal();     }      /*      * Convert integer for enum value.      */     public static Authentication forValue(int value)     {         return values()[value];     } } </code></pre>
