<p>i'm working on a j2me project with java wireless toolkit and i need to make 4 textbox next to each other. i used these for:</p>  <pre><code>private TextField emailTxt; private TextField passwordTxt; private TextField nameTxt; private TextField mobileTxt; private TextField urlTxt;   public UserRegistrationMIDlet() {     emailTxt = new TextField("pelak:\n", "", 2, TextField.EMAILADDR);     passwordTxt = new TextField("", "", 1, TextField.PASSWORD);     nameTxt = new TextField("", "", 3, TextField.ANY);     mobileTxt = new TextField("", "", 2, TextField.PHONENUMBER);     urlTxt = new TextField("address:", "", 100, TextField.URL); </code></pre>  <p>}</p>  <p>but j2me textboxes and textfields, every one fill a line and become under each other. as i searched for i understood the Textbox has no set location method but isn't there any other way to make them just next to each other? f.n: some one said that it's possible with changing the margins?! how?!</p>
