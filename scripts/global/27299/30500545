<p>I have created a J2ME app (all custom coded using Canvas for each screen) that works great on devices with keypads, but when the device has no keypad and no virtual keypad/keyboard (eg, some Nokia Asha devices) then the app cannot be used.</p>  <p>Is there a keyboard/keypad library I can plug into my app?</p>  <p>The main reason I need the keyboard/keypad is because the app has a search screen (Canvas) where the user can type in their query. </p>
