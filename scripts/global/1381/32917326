<p>On this page <a href="http://www.programcreek.com/2009/02/notify-and-wait-example/" rel="nofollow">link</a> on the first example, b.wait() is called. What would happend if b.wait() was never called, and the main thread was allowed to finish before the b thread was able to call notify()? Would an exception happen or would it do something funky? I could not find anything on the internet specific to this because I don't really know how to search for that situation. Thanks!</p>
