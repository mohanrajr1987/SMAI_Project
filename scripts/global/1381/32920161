<p>I just learning about Win32 programming and had a question about threading. Suppose I have the example below, I want to know if the PrintStuff() function being called inside the for-loop runs on the new thread that was created or does it run on the main thread? Thanks. </p>  <pre><code>    HANDLE hThrd;     DWORD WINAPI PrintStuff() {         OutputDebugString("printing stuff");         return 0;     }     int WINAPI WinMain(...) {         ...         hThrd = CreateThread(NULL, 0, (LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE)PrintStuff, NULL, CREATE_SUSPENDED, &amp;id)         int i;         for (i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {             PrintStuff();         }         ...     } </code></pre>
