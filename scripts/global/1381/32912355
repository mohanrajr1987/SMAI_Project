<p>I've been working on a top-down 2D game for my A-Level computing projected, and my client decided he would like a sound to be played when the game starts. My issue is i've created a class called Sound, that implements runnable (see below). In this class is my audio code. I've made an instance of the class in my main Game class, and it calls <code>sound.playSound(path)</code> when the Enum state is at <code>START</code> (start screen). I appear to get no sound at all. The code is below.</p>  <p>Thanks for your help.</p>  <p>Sound class:</p>  <pre><code>package com.ritcat14.GotYourSix.util;  import java.net.URL;  import javax.sound.sampled.AudioInputStream; import javax.sound.sampled.AudioSystem; import javax.sound.sampled.Clip;  public class Sound implements Runnable {      private String path;      public Sound() {     }      public void playSound(String path){         this.path = path;         Thread t = new Thread();         t.start();     }      public void run() {         try {             URL defaultSound = this.getClass().getResource(path);             AudioInputStream audioInputStream = AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream(defaultSound);             Clip clip = AudioSystem.getClip();             clip.open(audioInputStream);             clip.start();         } catch (Exception ex) {             ex.printStackTrace();         }     }  } </code></pre>
