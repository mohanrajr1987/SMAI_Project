<p>I need to run multiple single-thread jobs simultaneously in a production environment using Spring Batch. In a near future, I may need to run jobs with multi-threaded steps, too. I don't need persistence of the Sp Batch datasource, so I want to use an in-memory HSQLDB database. Are the basic options of transaction control and isolation level enough for Sp Batch to run without concurrency problems? I think that LOCKS transaction control and READ COMMITTED isolation should be enough but I didn't found any minimal specification in the Sp Batch documentation and want to be sure. Any personal experiences? Thanks in advance.</p>
