<p>I have a question involving threads and recovering from an orientation change.  I have seen a lot of great answers that cover threads or orientation changes, but precious few that cover both.  Here is a general scenario that covers my question:</p>  <ol> <li>App starts, contains one activity: one TextView populated with the variable "count", initially 0, a START and a STOP button.</li> <li>Start button starts thread (using Thread), which loops incrementing the number and updating the TextView. </li> <li>Stop button sets boolean flag so thread exits. </li> <li>All variables global and volatile, Object variable signal used to control thread.</li> </ol>  <p>Now, what is the best way to handle an orientation change.  I am assuming that I:</p>  <ul> <li>in onPause(), I call signal.wait() to pause the thread </li> <li>Save the variable "counter" on onSaveInstanceState() </li> <li>in onResume() I get "counter" back from onRestoreInstanceState()</li> </ul>  <p>Since onCreate()will create a new Object for "signal", how do I reestablish a link to the thread that is currenting wait()ing so that I can call notify() and resume it?</p>  <p>I explained this the best I could, I'll try to provide any additional information requested.</p>
