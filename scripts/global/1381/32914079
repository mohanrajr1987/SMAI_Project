<p>I'm using @Async annotations from Spring framework to work with a worker thread. The method signed with @Async annotation returns a Future and when I run this method this method i'm setting the Future.get parameters with an timeout.</p>  <p>I'm also overriding the configureAsyncSupport, from my configurer class that extends WebMvcConfigurationSupport, and there I'm setting the AsyncSupportConfigurer.setDefaultTimeout with the same values used on Future.get </p>  <p>But any timout is working and my process are locked into an infinit loop. What should I do to my thread processor apply my timeout?</p>
