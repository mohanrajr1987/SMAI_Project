<p>my application calls crystal reports viewer to display a report. I run the report viewer in a separate thread. It works just fine. it displays the report properly. my problem is i want to kill the report while it is processing if it is taking too long to run. While the report is processing the busy indicator is spinning and it seems to block any UI on the report viewer form. My report viewer form has a crystal reports viewer on it along with a close button at the bottom of the form itself. i would like to be able to click the close button and have it stop the processing. Here is my code to run the viewer in a single apartment thread</p>  <pre><code> public void RunReportStep1(UAReport report)     {         UAReportService service = new UAReportService(report);         service.RunReport();         var reportDocument = service.ReportDocument;            Thread staThread = new Thread(r =&gt; { RunReportStep2((ReportDocument) r); });         staThread.SetApartmentState(ApartmentState.STA);         staThread.Start(reportDocument);         staThread.Join();     }      public void RunReportStep2(ReportDocument reportDocument)     {         ReportViewerForm form = new ReportViewerForm(reportDocument);         form.BringToFront();         form.ShowDialog();         if (form.DialogResult == DialogResult.OK)         {          } </code></pre>  <p>what is the best way to kill the thread from within the report viewer form while the processing is going on. Once the processing completes and the report is destroyed closing the report is no problem. It's only a problem while the processing is going on before the report is displayed. While the report is processing the close button is not responsive. sometimes if i click it repeatedly i can get a response and the report cancels. but it is not consistent and i have to click it repeatedly. that is not acceptable for my clients to have to do.</p>
