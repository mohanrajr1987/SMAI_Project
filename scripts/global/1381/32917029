<p>I am succesfully swizziling <code>imageNamed:</code> method when on the main thread.</p>  <p>Here is my code, it is js-ctypes: <a href="https://gist.github.com/Noitidart/e8105a5f702dc9e6a4b8" rel="nofollow">https://gist.github.com/Noitidart/e8105a5f702dc9e6a4b8</a></p>  <p>I seem to be crashing when doing it from another thread. I'm not sure if it's a typo somwhere, I'm still digging but can't seem to find any mistakes. So I was wondering if swizziling with <code>method_setImplementation</code> is not thread safe?</p>  <p>Does the same thread safety apply to swizziling with <code>method_exchangeImplementations</code>?</p>
