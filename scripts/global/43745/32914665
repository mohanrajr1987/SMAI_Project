<p>I am working on a cross-platform React Native mobile app. I am writing console.log statements as I develop. I want to see these logging statements in Chrome while I'm running the Android app in the default Android emulator. According to <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/debugging.html" rel="nofollow">Facebook's docs</a> I just need to "shake the device". How do I do this in the Android emulator?</p>  <blockquote>   <p>To access the in-app developer menu:</p>      <p>On iOS shake the device or press control + ⌘ + z in the simulator.   On Android shake the device or press hardware menu button (available on older >devices and in most of the emulators, e.g. in genymotion you can press ⌘ + m to >simulate hardware menu button click)</p> </blockquote>
