<p>I am on college network and our proxy is not allowing download of Xamarin Android Player devices. So I downloaded the zip manually. Can someone tell me how to configure the zip with XAP(to see it device manager as installed). Tried copying the zip file to image library, it's not working. Step by step guide is appreciated.</p>
