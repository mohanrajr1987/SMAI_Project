<p>I am using Android Studio 1.3.2 to develop an android app and I am also using its emulator, I am trying to run the app on the emulator by creating AVD: Nexus 6 API 23 and when I run the app I can see only the nexus 6 with black screen, not even the android home screen. I saw that some people asked about this problem but none of the answers they got helped me to solve it. Does anyone know how to solve this ? Thanks for any help.</p>
