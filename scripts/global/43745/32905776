<p>I'm trying to put an app in standby mode. I'm using an emulator running Android API 23 (Revision 1). I am not able to put the app in standby by following the steps listed in the official docs:  - adb shell dumpsys battery unplug  - adb shell am set-inactive  true When I test if the app is actually in standby using "adb shell am get-inactive " I always obtain the following result "Idle=false". I've also locked the screen before executing the commands listed above but the result is always the same "Idle=false". Is anyone else experiencing the same behavior?</p>
