<p>I'm using Android Emulator that comes with Visual Studio 2015. When I run it, in Wi-Fi settings of Android this status appears <code>Obtaining IP Address..</code> for <code>Wired eth1</code> network. But it fails after a long time.</p>  <hr>  <h1><strong>What I've tried:</strong></h1>  <ul> <li>Removed all the <code>virtual switches</code> in <code>Virtual Switch Manager</code> of <code>Hyper-V</code> before running the emulator.</li> <li>Unchecked <code>automatic detect settings</code> in proxy settings</li> <li>Tried different API levels (19,22,..)</li> <li>Windows Phone Emulator doesn't have this problem and has internet connection.</li> <li>Restarted my PC!</li> </ul>  <hr>  <h1><strong>What I guess:</strong></h1>  <p>When I diagnose <code>vEthernet (Internal Ethernet Port Windows Phone Emulator Internal Switch)</code> it says it has an invalid IP address. Also inside android emulator it tries to obtain an IP. Obviously I need to give the emulator a valid IP, but I don't know how or where or what value.</p>  <p>How to give the Android emulator internet access? Thanks in advance.</p>
