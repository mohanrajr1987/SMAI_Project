<p>I am trying to build an application that displays the tree names and tree images(like a gallery) but for some reason, I could not see the application icon inside the emulator. The emulator launched just fine. I am new to Android Studio and I am not sure where to start to troubleshoot.  Any suggestions? Thank you in advance for all the help!</p>
