<p>I want to work with the Hybrid application in my android emulator. I have installed the application through command prompt. The application was perfectly installed and the launcher icon was displayed in the menu screen( in android emulator). </p>  <p>In the Android emulator when I <strong>click the launcher icon</strong>, <strong>black screen</strong> is displayed. But, the same application (.apk file) works very well in real devices like Nexus 4, Moto G3. In the same emulator I can able to access the AWS Hybrid application.</p>  <p><strong>Since I have some proxy server constraints is that could be a problem?</strong></p>  <p><strong>This application contains web services URL but the domain service is unknown.</strong></p>  <p>What could be the solution for this problem. </p>
