<p>I am using android development studio for developing android applications. For compiling, i am trying to use internal emulator. But after selecting internal emulator it is showing the following error:</p>  <p>emulator: ERROR: x86 emulation currently requires hardware acceleration! Please ensure Intel HAXM is properly installed and usable. CPU acceleration status: HAX kernel module is not installed!</p>  <p>How to avoid this error?</p>
