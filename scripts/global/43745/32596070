<p>So Im getting this error when I try to run my an emulator through Android Virtual device manager.  </p>  <pre><code>emulator: The memory needed by this AVD exceeds the max specified in your HAXM configuration. HAXM is not working and emulator runs in emulation mode emulator: AVD      RAM size = 1536 MB emulator: HAXM max RAM size = 1024 MB  </code></pre>  <p>Can someone tell me how to adjust the AVD RAM size and/or HAXM configuration to make this work?  Or what can I do to fix this problem? </p>
