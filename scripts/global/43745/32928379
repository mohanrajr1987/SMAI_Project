<p>I used to be able to <a href="http://codesmells.net/2015/07/27/installing-the-google-play-store-in-the-microsoft-visual-studio-android-emulator/" rel="nofollow">install Gapps on Visual Studio Emulator for Android</a>, but not anymore. I am wondering if this has to do with the the update of VSEFA that I installed today. The following error pops up after the Gapps zip file is dropped to an emulator: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/L0WYZ.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/L0WYZ.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>The log has the following:</p>  <pre><code>/system/bin/sh: syntax error: '(' unexpected </code></pre>  <p>Could anyone shed some light on this?</p>
