<p>I am currently using 'Visual Studio Emulator for Android' to run android apps on my computer, i find that after using multiple types of emulators bluestacks, genymotion, andy etc. That VS is the most stable and easy-to-use out of them all.</p>  <p>The only problem that i have compared to the other emulators is running apps that require root permission, with this being an emulator i know that its not possible to go the route of rooting via fastboot/recovery, this is the only method i know of rooting as thats how i normally do it on my phone.</p>  <p>I have tried most of the 'rooting' APK's (kingo,towel,frama etc) and none of those have worked.</p>  <p>So would anybody happen to know how i can get root access on Visual Studio Android Emulator?</p>  <p>I am trying to run a touch-replication app (Frep &amp; RepetiTouch) but all of them seem to require root access.</p>  <p>Any advice would be much appreciated. Thanks</p>
