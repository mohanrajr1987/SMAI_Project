<p>This code works perfectly fine on an Emulator (Geneymotion), but doesn't work in phone, or tablet:</p>  <pre><code>     Document doc = new Document();      try {                   String path = Environment.getExternalStoragePublicDirectory(Environment.DIRECTORY_DOWNLOADS)  + "/invoices";                   File dir = new File(path);                  if(!dir.exists())                      dir.mkdirs();                   Log.d("PDFCreator", "PDF Path: " + path);                   File delete = new File(dir, "invoice.pdf");                  if (delete.exists())                      delete.delete();                   File file = new File(dir, "invoice.pdf");   FileOutputStream fOut = new FileOutputStream(file);               PdfWriter.getInstance(doc, fOut);               //open the document              doc.open();              Paragraph name = new Paragraph("NAME");              doc.add(name);      } catch (DocumentException de) {                  Log.e("PDFCreator", "DocumentException:" + de);              } catch (IOException e) {                  Log.e("PDFCreator", "ioException:" + e);              }      finally      {         doc.close();      } </code></pre>  <p>I've added the required permissions.</p>  <p>My question is, why would a piece of code work in an emulator, but not on the actual device? Isn't an emulator suppose to emulate a device? So shouldn't the outcome be the same?</p>  <p>The above code runs when I click a button, in the emulator when I click that button, it creates the file in the designated directory, but when I test it in a phone, when I press the button, nothing happens, no file is created, nor is any folder created.</p>  <p>What is the problem? Can anyone give me some direction please.</p>
