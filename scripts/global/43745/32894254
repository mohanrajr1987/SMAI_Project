<p>I am writing a service that opens deep links to Android apps through adb like so:</p>  <pre><code>adb shell am start -W -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d http://www.example.com/deeplinktest com.example.mjohnst.deeplinktest </code></pre>  <p>The above command works correctly:</p>  <pre><code>Starting: Intent { act=android.intent.action.VIEW dat=http://www.example.com/... pkg=com.example.mjohnst.deeplinktest } Status: ok Activity: com.example.mjohnst.deeplinktest/.MainActivity ThisTime: 606 TotalTime: 606 WaitTime: 731 Complete </code></pre>  <p>What I want to do, is have the app already open/warm to <em>any</em> view, and still be able to visit the deep link.</p>  <p>If I have the app open on the emulator and try this, I  get this warning:</p>  <pre><code>Warning: Activity not started, its current task has been brought to the front </code></pre>  <p>and the deep link is not visited (the current, non-linked view of the app is brought to the foreground).</p>  <p><strong>Is there any way for me to visit a deep link on an already open app <em>through adb or another interface?</em></strong></p>  <p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I know that there's a <code>-s</code> flag to kill the app before visiting, but this is not what I want. I would like the warm start to provide a performance gain</p>
