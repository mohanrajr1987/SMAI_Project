<p>My issue is that runtime permissions are not working on my app.  It is behaving as usual. Below is the emualator im using: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/GIqHH.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/GIqHH.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>and here is my androidManifest target sdk levels:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;uses-sdk         android:minSdkVersion="16"         android:targetSdkVersion="23" /&gt; </code></pre>  <p>should i have the 23 to MNC or whats the issue ? The reason i know its not working is because i hold the internet permission and read external storage permission. i am able to see the admob ads right away without asking for internet permission (btw can you imagine how annoying that is, every app uses the internet and now there all going to ask for permission ).  </p>
