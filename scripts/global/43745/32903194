<p>I am currently updating an app from the old to the new UI. So I have 2 emulators open: one with old and one with new version. </p>  <p>Now, when I try to push APK to the emulator, Android Studio will offer installation to both devices. </p>  <p>As I don't ever want to update the version on the emulator with the old UI, is there a way that I detach or hide this emulators from ADB? So I don't update the app with the old UI accidentally. </p>
