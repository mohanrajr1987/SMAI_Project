<p>I'm trying to reproduce a bug reported by one of my users, having a <a href="http://www.samsung.com/it/consumer/mobile-devices/tablets/galaxy-tab-s/SM-T805NTSAITV" rel="nofollow">Samsung Galaxy Tab S</a>. I found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3745491/emulate-samsung-galaxy-tab">this question</a>, but its content seems outdated (so MUCH has changed since '11).</p>  <p>I also tried to follow <a href="https://andjaswahyu.wordpress.com/2012/11/14/how-to-add-samsung-galaxy-sdk-add-on-and-samsung-galaxy-emulator-into-eclipse/" rel="nofollow">this guide</a>: it works, but the model of Galaxy Tab emulated is also very old (API 8).</p>  <p>Is Samsung still publishing third party add-ons for Android SDK? Where can I find images more recent than <a href="http://developer.samsung.com/technical-doc/view.do?v=T000000042" rel="nofollow">this</a>?</p>
