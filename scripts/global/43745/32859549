<p>I'm creating a program for android using the ndk. I assume my program has some memory access issues but I cannot find them at all. To that end I would like to run the android emulator in memcheck mode. This is documented <a href="https://github.com/cgjones/android-external-qemu/blob/master/docs/ANDROID-MEMCHECK.TXT" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/cgjones/android-external-qemu/blob/master/docs/ANDROID-MEMCHECK.TXT</a> as well as <a href="http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.handhelds.android.ndk/3816" rel="nofollow">http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.handhelds.android.ndk/3816</a></p>  <p>I created an avd and can start it using emulator @Nexus_One_API_23. however I cannot add the -memcheck option because it 'doesn't exist' according to the emulator. Does anyone have an idea how to get the emulator started in memcheck mode ?</p>
