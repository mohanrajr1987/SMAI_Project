<p>I'm using Visual Studio 2015 Enterprise with the new Android Emulator. It worked pretty well for a while but suddenly it stopped working.</p>  <p>The output in VS shows always this:</p>  <pre><code>1&gt;Starting emulator: VS Emulator 5.1" Lollipop (5.1.1) XXHDPI Phone 1&gt;Validating emulator arguments... 1&gt;Determining if emulator is already running... 1&gt;Preparing virtual machine... 1&gt;Launching emulator... </code></pre>  <p>The emulator window appears but it stucks on the black "Loading..." screen. I see in the taskmanager that <code>xde.exe</code> is consuming between 25% and 32% of CPU power. There are no entries in the Windows eventlog telling anything about <code>xde</code> or Hyper-V.  I've already deleted all virtual computers in the Hyper-V-Manager as suggested by Microsoft on the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt228282.aspx#NoStart" rel="nofollow">Troubleshooting the Visual Studio Emulator for Android</a> page.</p>  <p>Has anyone an idea how to get the emulator running again?</p>
