<p>Is it possible to compile and run a Samsung Android image (e.g., image of Galaxy S6 or older version with some modifications) in a mainline Qemu? </p>  <p>Thank you </p>  <p><strong>Update:</strong></p>  <p>Samsung has released the source code for most of its mobile devices including Galaxy S6. That's why I want to try running them in Qemu or DroidScope [1] (which is built atop of Qemu)</p>  <p>[1] DroidScope: <a href="https://code.google.com/p/decaf-platform/wiki/DroidScope" rel="nofollow">https://code.google.com/p/decaf-platform/wiki/DroidScope</a></p>
