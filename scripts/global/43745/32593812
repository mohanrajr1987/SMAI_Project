<p>I have searched every topic about those, even very old topics for days. But still it continues. For 5 days, i cant see a hello world label in emulator.</p>  <p>My system speficitaions:</p>  <pre><code>p4 2.8 ghz, 2 gb ram, 256 mb gpu </code></pre>  <p>Yes, it is old pc.</p>  <p>My first question:</p>  <p>1- With android studio, i run genymotion emulator but the device (with 512 mb ram) gives that famous ip error. After a few starting and running vm and genymotiÄ±n, it can run. Also same for eclipse. This can be about my pc specifications or should i change something else? I did every option about network and other but still, i have to run again and again.</p>  <p>2- I am thinking of buying a tablet. Because tablets are cheaper than pnoes. I am making an app for phones to get the gps and do something. So, after project is done, i will make it suitable for phones with changing some size options, is it so easy? Bwecause avd emulators r are really starting slow and i couldnot even see a hello world text. And do you think, this relaxs my pc?</p>  <p>3 - In past, with this same pc,  with old eclipse adt probably kepler, i could run emulator but after downloading latest versions, i cant do it. Because sdk doesnot work, wants to be upgraded,is there anyway to do this?</p>  <p>4- My last try on eclipse</p>  <p>[2015-09-15 21:59:04 - Uploading Jsoup.apk onto device '192.168.125.101:5555' [2015-09-15 21:59:16 -  Failed to install Jsoup.apk on device '192.168.125.101:5555': timeout [2015-09-15 21:59:16 - Launch canceled!</p>  <p>Do you think it isbecause of lack of memory?</p>
