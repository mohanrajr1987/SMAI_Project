<p>In Eclipse I've created an Android Emulator.</p>  <p>I've set 2000MB as Internal Storage using the configurator, but starting the emulator and looking into Storage properties I Always see 533 MB as total space.</p>  <p>I've tried to add <code>-partition-size 1024</code> but the total space is still 533 MB.</p>  <p>My application downloads data from a JSON source and requires at least 600 MB, but I can't understand why emulator doesn't use my configuration.</p>  <p>Any suggestion?</p>
