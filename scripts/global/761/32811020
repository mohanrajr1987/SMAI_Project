<p>I'm trying to work with motion-game gem, I followed all the steps to setup rubymotion and motion-game, but some of the main features of motion-game gem aren't working.</p>  <p>I ran: </p>  <pre><code>motion create --template=motion-game HelloGame cd HelloGame rake android:config </code></pre>  <p>then this happens</p>  <pre><code>rake aborted! Don't know how to build task 'android:config'  (See full trace by running task with --trace) </code></pre>  <p>How to fix it ?</p>
