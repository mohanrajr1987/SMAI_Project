<p>I am upgrading an old Rails application to Rails 3.2. I will have to upgrade it to Rails 4 (and 5 !) in the future.</p>  <p>I don't know what to do with two gems, restful_authentication (<a href="https://github.com/technoweenie/restful-authentication" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/technoweenie/restful-authentication</a>) and role_requirement (<a href="https://github.com/timcharper/role_requirement" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/timcharper/role_requirement</a>).</p>  <p>I think I will upgrade restful_authentication to Devise. But what about role_requirement ? Is it compatible with Devise ? Is there another gem to use? A gem like CanCan is very different from role_requirement, and I would like to not rewrite all the code.</p>
