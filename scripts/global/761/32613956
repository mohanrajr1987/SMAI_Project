<p>I'm writing a console utility for managing Github issues and I've run into a <code>undefined method</code> error.</p>  <p>My app is structured the following way</p>  <pre><code>gissues.rb # includes all files in subfolders  Gissues     github.rb #Gissues::Github general github stuff      commands.rb #Gissues::commands subclass of Thor (whatisthor.com), general command stuff      cli.rb #subclass of commands, lists command shortcuts and subcommands      commands          user.rb #Command::User subclass of Gissues::Commands holds logic for github user related commands like signin, signout, whoami      github          user.rb #Github::User subclass of Gissues::Github holds logic for communicating with github for authentication (checking credentials) </code></pre>  <p>I defined methods for communicating with Github in user.rb inside the github folder. I want to use these methods in user.rb defined in the commands folder but when I do, it seems outside the scope and I get a method not defined error.</p>  <p>user.rb (commands) looks like this</p>  <pre><code>module Gissues     class Command::User &lt; Gissues::Command         desc "signin", "Starts loging sequence"         def signin             Gissues::Github::User::request_token         end      end end </code></pre>  <p>and I'm getting the following error</p>  <pre><code>/Users/someone/RubymineProjects/Gissues/lib/gissues/commands/user.rb:9:in `signin': undefined method `request_token' for Gissues::Github::User:Class (NoMethodError) </code></pre>  <p>What am I doing wrong? Thanks in advance</p>  <p>Edit: <img src="http://i.imgur.com/hhnGNnH.png" alt="This image may make the structure more clear"> This image may make the structure more clear</p>
