<p>I have two Macs both up to date with OS X and Xcode.  On one, I can install cocoapods and the pods specified in my project's podfile.  The other fails:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>pod install --verbose   Preparing</p>      <p>Updating local specs repositories</p>      <p>Creating shallow clone of spec repo <code>master</code> from   <code>https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git</code>   $ /opt/local/bin/git clone   <a href="https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git</a> master --depth=1   Cloning into   'master'...   error: error:1006706B:elliptic curve   routines:ec_GFp_simple_oct2point:point is not on curve while accessing   <a href="https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git/info/refs?service=git-upload-pack" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git/info/refs?service=git-upload-pack</a>   fatal: HTTP request failed [!] Unable to add a source with url   <code>https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git</code> named <code>master</code>.

To me it smells like an encryption/decryption issue or https/ssl issue.</p>  <p>On the machine having trouble, I did have a pre-beta Xcode installed, but I've since deleted it and made sure it's command line tools are set correctly.</p>  <p>Anyone have suggestion on how to remedy this or diagnosis it further?</p>
