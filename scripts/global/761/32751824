<p>I am new to ruby and trying to setup my dev environment (Windows 10). I have installed ruby and rails but cannot install byebug. From what I read I need the DevKit first. So I installed it by following the guide here: </p>  <p><a href="https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/wiki/Development-Kit" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/wiki/Development-Kit</a></p>  <p>and then tried to install the gem but have no luck. I have tried to uninstall and then force install DevKit but still cant get byebug installed. This is what I am seeing:</p>  <pre><code>C:\RubySDK&gt;gem install byebug Temporarily enhancing PATH to include DevKit... Building native extensions.  This could take a while... ERROR:  Error installing byebug:         ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.
