<p>I'm trying to create a rating system in my app. I decided to use acs_as_votable gem, as it seems to be a powerful and popular gem that offers voting functionality.</p>  <p>I want to make my articles votable, and that works.</p>  <p>However, I would like to sort articles based on publishing date, and then sort the articles published on the same day by number of upvotes.</p>  <p>I think the question is clear, but let me illustrate by example.</p>  <p>Let's say Article , Article  and Article 3 are published today and they have 5, 3, 10 upvotes, respectivley.</p>  <p>Article 4, article 5 and article 6 are articles posted yesterday and they have 1,2 and 3 upvotes respectivley.</p>  <p>Sorted articles should look like</p>  <pre><code>Article 3 (10 upvotes) Article 1 (5 upvotes) Article 2 (3 upvotes) Article 6 (3 upvotes) Article 5 (2 upvotes) Article 4 (1 upvote) </code></pre>  <p>Ideally, I would like to extract the date before all articles posted on the same day (something like on producthunt) so it would loo like this, but this is optional.</p>  <pre><code>**9/22/2015** Article 3 (10 upvotes) Article 1 (5 upvotes) Article 2 (3 upvotes) **9/21/2015** Article 6 (3 upvotes) Article 5 (2 upvotes) Article 4 (1 upvote) </code></pre>  <p>Simple sorting by upvotes was solved here: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19103738/acts-as-votable-ordering-by-upvotes">acts_as_votable ordering by upvotes</a></p>  <p>But how do I sort by two criteria: date and upvote?</p>  <p>Any help is appreciated.</p>
