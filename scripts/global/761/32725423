<p>According to the Bitly Api documentation, it is possible to get User Metrics data (<a href="http://dev.bitly.com/user_metrics.html" rel="nofollow">http://dev.bitly.com/user_metrics.html</a>) such as User Clicks, Total Clicks, Popular Clicks, but there seems to be no ruby Gem with examples on how to get that data.  I'm currently using gem 'omniauth-bitly', gem 'bitly' and gem 'bitly-oauth' by initializing like so:</p>  <pre><code>Bitly.use_api_version_3 @bitly = Bitly.configure do |config| config.api_version = 3 config.access_token = "my_accesstoken_string" end </code></pre>  <p>Then I can get a particular clicks count of 1 link by         @bitly.client.clicks('my_link')  but I would like to get ALL the authenticated user's links clicks. Any ideas?</p>
