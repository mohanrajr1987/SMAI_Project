<p>I tried to modify an existing gem and forked the git repository. I added some commits and pointed bundler to my GitHub repository. <code>bundler update</code> does recognise the change and downloads my version of the gem. Anyway when I try to launch the application which depends on that gem (testkitchen) my changes aren't available. And when I delete the official version of the gem my version is not found/used and the app fails.</p>  <p>The weird thing is that all the official gems are installed to <code>/var/lib/gems</code> and my version goes to <code>~/.bundler</code></p>  <p><code>gem environment</code> also shows up the correct directories</p>  <pre><code>- GEM PATHS:      - /var/lib/gems/2.2.0      - /home/ansible/.bundler/ruby/2.2.0 </code></pre>  <p>I'm not using rvm or similar. Am I doing something wrong?</p>
