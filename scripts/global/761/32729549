<p>I am very new to ruby, and am using Ubuntu , I installed ruby last week and have been using it ever since. But when I decided to start studying rails I realised the rails server will not start, I decided to reinstall ruby, and then rails, which I did successfully.</p>  <p>But now when I install a ruby gem, I do not see it, not even when I type <code>gem list</code> on the terminal, it also throws an error when I try to run it in a program. I am very frustrated and do not know what to do..</p>
