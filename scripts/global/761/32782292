<p>I released <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/ruby_buzz" rel="nofollow">my gem</a>. According to RubyGems.org, I had over 200 downloads in under a week. I realise that a great deal of these will be indexing sites, library archives etc. It's unlikely that 200 people have downloaded and tried my single-device HID library already. It's a little tricky as it is for a specific device, which narrows the field of potential users a lot.</p>  <p>Is it possible to find out if any real users have tried it? Is there any way to request for feedback on the library and it's documentation?</p>
