<p>I am adding the <a href="https://github.com/randoum/autonumeric-rails" rel="nofollow">autoNumeric</a> gem to a project. On my local development environment, <code>assets:precompile</code> or <code>rails s</code> results in <code>Sprockets::FileNotFound: couldn't find file 'autonumeric' (in myapp/app/assets/javascripts/application.js)</code>.</p>  <p>I have tried:</p>  <ul> <li>removing/re-adding gems</li> <li>restarting server (when trying <code>rails s</code>)</li> <li>adding <code>bundle exec</code> to commands</li> <li>creating a new clean VM with same codebase</li> </ul>  <p>The puzzling thing for me, is that it is running fine an our CI server and another developer's machine. All gem versions are the same, codebase is the same. </p>  <p>The only environmental difference I can see is that the environments I'm failing on were setup using <code>ruby-build/rbenv</code> and the passing ones using <code>rvm</code>. </p>  <p>If I manually copy the assets from the Gem's source into my app, then it resolves the issue on my failing environments, but is not a viable solution.</p>  <p>What are some other steps I can take to help debug this issue?</p>
