<p>I just updated my MAC to OSX 10.11 El Capitan and some gems didn't remain so, the problem: when i try to run the installations of some GEM's... e.g.</p>  <pre><code>sudo gem install compass </code></pre>  <p><strong>I get the error:</strong></p>  <pre><code>ERROR:  While executing gem ... (Errno::EPERM) Operation not permitted </code></pre>  <p>This happens with other gems as wells...</p>  <p>I've homebrew and tried to install ruby agains but nothing.. </p>
