<p>apparently there is a thread that addresses this issue . But I have already tried to run those commands given in the solution. I am still getting the same error for some reason.</p>  <p>I run  <code>gem install mysql2 -v  0.3.18</code></p>  <p>followed by  <code>bundle install</code></p>  <p>on my terminal. And than I start the server by typing  rails server</p>  <p>Upon opening the localhost:3000. I receive the same error.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Specified 'mysql2' for database adapter, but the gem is not loaded. Add <code>gem 'mysql2'</code> to your Gemfile (and ensure its version is at the minimum required by ActiveRecord).</p> </blockquote>  <p>Any help would be much appreciated. </p>
