<p><strong>EDIT</strong> This question relates to Ruby v 1.9.3 and Windows. There is another thread with solutions to Rails and Linux/Mac machines but I am unable to find a solution on Windows and Ruby. I have tried every solution posted in the other thread.</p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4528101/ssl-connect-returned-1-errno-0-state-sslv3-read-server-certificate-b-certificat">SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read server certificate B: certificate verify failed</a></p>  <p>Simple question. I am using the gem HTTP, <a href="https://github.com/httprb/http" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/httprb/http</a> , to make HTTP calls to certain API's. Everything works fine but I cannot make a POST to any site with HTTPS. Any secure URL results in</p>  <pre><code>  SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read server certificate B: certificate verify failed (OpenSSL::SSL::SSLError) </code></pre>  <p>Some of my searching has lead me to think it is an issue within ruby but no threads I've read have lead to a solution to the issue.</p>
