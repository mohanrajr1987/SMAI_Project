<p>I'm having this error when running <code>gem tweetstream</code></p>  <blockquote>   <p>terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::runtime_error'   what(): Encryption not available on this event-machine</p> </blockquote>  <p>I understand it has something to do with my libssl. How do I install libssl-dev on windows? </p>  <p>Is there an equivalent of ubuntu's <code>aptitude install libssl-dev</code> for windows or a gem?</p>
