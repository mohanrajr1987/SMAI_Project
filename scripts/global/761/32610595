<p>I'm using the "jira-ruby" gem, which provide an interface to Jira from RoR. When I fetch issues, it works great, but the attachments collection is always empty, even when I know for 100% that the issue has attachments.</p>  <pre><code>filter = "project = \"My Project\"" issues = client.Issue.jql(filter, options = {max_results: -1})  issues.each do |issue|     attachments = issue.attachments # &lt;&lt; Always empty! end </code></pre>  <p>Am I doing it wrong?</p>
