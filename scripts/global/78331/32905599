<p>Im working on cordova application.</p>  <p>After installing <br/><strong>cordova-plugin-google-analytics</strong>  (<a href="https://github.com/danwilson/google-analytics-plugin" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/danwilson/google-analytics-plugin</a>) <br/>my build starts to fail with error code </p>  <p><code>Multiple dex files define Landroid/support/annotation/AnimRes </code></p>  <p>After spending few hours on resolving and googling i'm quite sure it's related to conflict with<br/>  <strong>phonegap-facebook-plugin</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/Wizcorp/phonegap-facebook-plugin/" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/Wizcorp/phonegap-facebook-plugin/</a>)<br/> because phonegap-facebook-plugin uses <code>android-support-v4</code> jar</p>  <p>One of solution was to remove <code>android-support-v4</code>, but this doesn't work for me (how it could if facebook just needs this jar..)</p>  <p>Another soluction was to create <code>build-extras.gradle</code> file with some content (can't remember) - also failed</p>  <p>Some of solutions was related to Android Studio stuff, i don't use Android Studio, i cannot use it. i'm buildind from command line.</p>  <p>Does anyone know another solution which i can try?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
