<p>I'm trying to figure out how to ignore invalid SSL certificates in crosswalk for android. I tried to follow <a href="http://www.thomasmaximini.com/2015/01/23/getting-started-with-crosswalk-in-ionic.html" rel="nofollow">this blog</a> </p>  <p>However i cannot locate the java file in the path specified. I did see the code block in a file (<code>XWalkCordovaResourceClient.java</code>) under plugins, I made the changes but it still doesn't fix the issue when i build release.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/U4H4e.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/U4H4e.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
