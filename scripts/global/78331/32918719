<p>When we navigate from one page to another, by default ionic will do the sliding page animation. But there are certain time under certain condition when navigate from one page to another it does not show the page transition animation. For example when navigate from a tab page (#/tab/content) to a none tab page (#/aboutus), there will be no animation.</p>  <p>How can I force Ionic to do the transition animation on certain page? Also, having the transition animation when navigate back to previous page?</p>
