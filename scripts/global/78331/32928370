<p>My scenario is I'm using Visual Studio with Cordova (5.1.1). On a fresh install of the app on my Android device or emulator things work well. I use client.login("google") and I'm given the screen which lets you type in your Google authentication information. Then every time I open the app it just automatically knows which Google account you're using and logs right into Azure with no problems.</p>  <p>My problem is even if I do client.logout() I can't get it to ask for your Google account information again. Does anybody know how to clear that out?</p>
