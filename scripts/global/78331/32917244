<p>I am trying to do a cross domain ajax post from my javascript code in phonegap. I am using this code to do so:</p>  <pre><code>$.ajax({     type: "POST",     url: "...",     crossDomain: true,     cache: false,     success: function (data, status) {         alert("success");     },     error: function () {         alert("fails");     } }); </code></pre>  <p>With my rest client for the url.</p>  <p>I have put</p>  <pre><code>$.support.cors = true; </code></pre>  <p>at the top of the javascript code. I have also included both these lines in my config.xml:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;feature name="http://api.phonegap.com/1.0/network"/&gt; &lt;access origin="*" /&gt; </code></pre>  <p>When I run this code from the phonegap developer app on android I get the success alert meaning that the AJAX call has successfully gone through. When I attempt to build the app from build.phonegap.com and install the APK, the AJAX triggers the fail alert.</p>  <p>It is getting really infuriating as I have tried everything that has been suggested on the internet but I cant get this damn cross origin AJAX call to work.</p>  <p>Please help</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
