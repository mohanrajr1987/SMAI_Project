<p>I am considering to develop an app to be used as an alternative to a phone call: to be clear, not another internet voice calling app, but something that the user would be asked to use as an alternative whenever he/she is starting a phone call. In android, for example, when you tap on a phone number you are asked to choose what application you prefer to use for the operation: is it possible to do this with a Cordova app?</p>
