I followed (<a href="http://moduscreate.com/building-a-custom-phonegap-plugin-for-ios/" rel="nofollow">http://moduscreate.com/building-a-custom-phonegap-plugin-for-ios/</a>) this tutorial to build native custom plugin for iOS but when I build my project on xcode it gives me the following <br>ERROR:  Plugin 'FileWriter' not found, or is not a CDVPlugin. Check your plugin mapping in config.xml. 2015-10-02 22:10:07.168 MyCPlug[2673:196404] -[CDVCommandQueue executePending] [Line 159] FAILED pluginJSON = ["FileWriter247765134","FileWriter","cordovaGetFileContents",[]]</p>  <p>I've followed each and every bit of details and tried multiple times but I failed to succeed.<br></p>
