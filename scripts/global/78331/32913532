<p>I'm trying to use the ngCordova Camera plugin and display an image that the camera just took or was pulled from the photo library.</p>  <p>When it runs in ripple, it works when using the option camera.DestinationType.DATA_URL.</p>  <p>But if I use an Android emulator (Kit Kat) works when using the option camera.DestinationType.FILE_URI </p>  <p>I want to be able to check which device and use the correct option. </p>
