<p>I want to write a config.xml such that it can be used by both phonegap build and phonegap CLI.</p>  <p>For the default icon,</p>  <p>phonegap build requires the icon to be placed under app/www/icon.png, and config.xml declared as</p>  <pre><code>&lt;icon src="icon.png" /&gt; </code></pre>  <p>But in phonegap cli, it seems that it is unable to recognize the path above. And will throw an error while building.</p>  <p>i have also tried</p>  <pre><code>&lt;icon src="www/icon.png" /&gt; </code></pre>  <p>But this does not work in phonegap build. The app icon is displayed on the webpage, but the app downloaded does not have an icon.</p>  <p>Does anyone know what is the best way to resolve this issue?</p>
