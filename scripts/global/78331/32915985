<p>I'm working on adding facebook api integration with ionic/cordova and am trying to find the debug hash key that is generated for my app when i do:</p>  <pre><code>ionic build android </code></pre>  <p>I know that it generates a new .keystore file at /userhomedir/.android/debug.keystore. But <strong>what does it set as the alias and password</strong>? And how can I retrieve this hash key after cordova has created it for my app. I don't see the hash key being printed anywhere during build process.</p>  <p>I need the generated hash key to give to Facebook API to use their sign on SDK</p>
