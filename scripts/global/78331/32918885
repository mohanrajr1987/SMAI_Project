<p>I have been banging my head against my computer for hours trying to figure out why this simple ngCordova plugin isn't running like it's supposed to. I have added all the necessary providers, as documented here: <a href="http://ngcordova.com/docs/plugins/zip/" rel="nofollow">http://ngcordova.com/docs/plugins/zip/</a></p>  <p>This is all just a test to get the zip plugin to work. I know for sure the $cordovaFile and $cordovaFileTransfer functions are executing, but I'm not sure why my $cordovaZip function isn't doing anything.</p>  <p>I should note that I am running the ios6 emulator.</p>  <ol> <li>I have a legit .zip file in the location of the targetPath variable filepath</li> <li>I assume my destination path is correct, as it's just a directory on my machine</li> <li>When I execute this function in my emulator, I get neither a success or failure message. It's as if it's being completely ignored.</li> </ol>  <p>I should mention that these are my plugins that are installed:</p>  <pre><code>com.ionic.keyboard 1.0.4 "Keyboard" cordova-plugin-console 1.0.1 "Console" cordova-plugin-device 1.0.1 "Device" cordova-plugin-file 3.0.0 "File" cordova-plugin-file-transfer 1.3.0 "File Transfer" cordova-plugin-splashscreen 2.1.0 "Splashscreen" cordova-plugin-whitelist 1.0.0 "Whitelist" cordova-plugin-zip 3.0.0 "cordova-plugin-zip" </code></pre>  <p>This is my code. Any thoughts?</p>  <pre><code>   // Make sure the device is ready in order to start     document.addEventListener('deviceready', function () {         var url = "https://www.dropbox.com/s/upncdwuw4seh4m2/jake.zip?dl=1";          // Check to see if the file exists         $cordovaFile.checkFile(cordova.file.documentsDirectory, "jake.zip")           .then(function (success) {             console.log('this file exists');           }, function (error) {             // error           });         var targetPath = cordova.file.documentsDirectory+ "jake.zip";         var trustHosts = true;         var options = {};          $cordovaFileTransfer.download(url, targetPath, options, trustHosts)           .then(function(result) {             $scope.downloadingFile = 'File complete';             $scope.fileDownloaded = true;              $cordovaZip                 .unzip(                   targetPath,                    '/Users/[username]/Desktop'                  ).then(function () {                   console.log('success');                 }, function () {                   console.log('error');                 }, function (progressEvent) {                  });            }, function(err) {             // Error           }, function (progress) {                 console.log(progress);           });           }, false); </code></pre>  <p>I can't seem to find anything about how else I can get this thing to run, because I'm not getting any errors or any types of resolution from anything I've tried :'(</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
