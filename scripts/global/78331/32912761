<p>I have created a cordova project adding 2 platforms (android, ios) with some plugin. One of them is the last cordova-plugin-crosswalk-webview (1.3.1). I have chose iOS8 and android 4.0 like target android. Everything work well, i can build the android platform and the iOS too.</p>  <p>On my config.xml file this line are automatical added:</p>  <pre><code>... &lt;preference name="xwalkVersion" value="14+" /&gt; &lt;preference name="xwalkCommandLine" value="--disable-pull-to-refresh-effect" /&gt; &lt;preference name="xwalkMode" value="embedded" /&gt; ... </code></pre>  <p>For android i'm sure to use the crosswalk plugin. With Chrome inspector i can see the navigator.userAgent setted to Crosswalk similar to this <a href="https://crosswalk-project.org/assets/cordova-with-devtools.jpg" rel="nofollow">image</a></p>  <p>My package android-debug.apk is now splitted in android-debug-armv7.apk and android-debug-x86.apk and the apk size is near to 25Mb.</p>  <p>But for iOS i can't undestand if crosswalk is working or not. On the safari inspector of my iOS Virtual Machine the navigator.userAgent variable is: </p>  <pre><code>"Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 8_4 like Mac OS X)  AppleWebKit/600.1.4 (KHTML, like Gecko) Mobile/12H141 (140222960683616)" </code></pre>  <p>How i can be sure of what browser i'm runnig on my iOS? And, if the config.xml configuration is not enought, how i can set crosswalk-webview fos iOS?</p>  <p>I have read the <a href="https://crosswalk-project.org/documentation/ios/quick_start_guide.html" rel="nofollow">quick start guide</a> of crosswalk for iOS but i think that is not so understandable for who use cordova CLI normally. And nothing is written on documentation of <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-plugin-crosswalk-webview" rel="nofollow">cordova-plugin-crosswalk-webview npm package</a>.</p>
