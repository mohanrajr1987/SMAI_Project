<p>I'm searching for a good way to identify a device on iOS with my cordova application. I'm using <a href="https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/3.0.0/cordova_device_device.md.html#device.uuid" rel="nofollow">device.uuid</a> but it's not a good identifier because after a new installation or update it creates a new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier" rel="nofollow">uuid</a>. I thought about hashing the mac address of the device but it seems to me like there is no way getting the mac address of a device on iOS. </p>  <p>So how can I identify a device on iOS?</p>
