<p>Hi there i dont really get what is wrong with this as it's supposed to be working fine but ... . I get my image loaded which means the first line is correct but when I key in the second line after equation sign I am supposed to get auto completed but not only wont it get auto completed but also it wont even get recognized as pre-defined function in swift .  Tnx </p>  <pre><code>   let image = UIImage (name : "Source.png")!        let rbgaImage =RGBAImage(image : image) </code></pre>
