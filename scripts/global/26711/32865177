<p>I have a UICollectionView, in which I am showing some images by downloading it from server. To show these Images I an using AFNetworking class method  <strong>setImageWithURL:(URL*)</strong>. </p>  <p>Image size is about (968, 968) this is taking hell lot of memory. If I convert these Images to NSData and compressed it by UIImageJPEGRepresentation method it is taking a lot of time to convert Image into NSData. Is there any way to reduce size of images and show into collection view cell without much delay.</p>
