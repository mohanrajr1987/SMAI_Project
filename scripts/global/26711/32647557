<p>I have a iOS Swift Project for share and save image. I try to add a long press interaction to save the image. I created the function of interaction, but I do not know how to save the image in Swift.</p>  <p>My code</p>  <pre><code>override func viewDidLoad() {          super.viewDidLoad()          let longPressRecognizer = UILongPressGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: "longPressed:")         self.view.addGestureRecognizer(longPressRecognizer)      }  func longPressed(sender: UILongPressGestureRecognizer) {          println("longpressed")      } </code></pre>  <p>I would like to know how to add image in the library pictures. Thank you in advance for your response.</p>
