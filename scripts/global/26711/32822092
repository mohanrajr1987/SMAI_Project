<h1>I have this transparent image:</h1>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8P8s8.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8P8s8.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>My goal is to change the "ME!" parts color. Either tint only the last 3rd of the image, or replace the blue color with the new color.</p>  <p><strong>Expected result after color change:</strong></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/hkthz.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/hkthz.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Unfortunately neither worked for me. To change the specific color I tried this: <a href="https://gist.github.com/Shilo/1292152" rel="nofollow">LINK</a>, but as the documentation says, this works only without alpha channel!</p>  <p>Then I tried this one: <a href="https://github.com/bennyguitar/BGUtilities" rel="nofollow">LINK</a>, but this actually does nothing, no tint or anything.</p>  <p>Is there any other way to tint only one part of the color or just replace a specific color?</p>  <h1>I know I could slice the image in two parts, but I hope there is another way.</h1>
