<p>In my app there's a <code>UIWebView</code>. The loaded webpage in it has some images, and I would like to use these images in somewhere else (e.g. display them in <code>UIImageView</code>) </p>  <p>So is it possible to get the loaded images directly from <code>UIWebView</code> without downloading them again? What I am doing now is get the URLs to the images from the html file and download them, but this is too time consuming.</p>
