<p>I need to display an image in a ï£¿ Watch app. Initially I was using <code>imageView.setImageNamed("us")</code> and it was good. </p>  <p>Now I need to manipulate the image so I need to create an instance of the image, then manipulate and display it. To make an instance (a copy) of the image I use <code>let image = UIImage(named: "us")!</code> but it returns <code>nil</code> and I can't understand the reason... Does someone know why?</p>  <p>EDIT: <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4712155/Prova.zip" rel="nofollow">Here's an example project.</a></p>
