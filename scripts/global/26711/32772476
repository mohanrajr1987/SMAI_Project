<p>The app I'm working on uses collection view cells to display data to the user. I want the user to be able to share the data that's contained in the cells, but there are usually too many cells to try to re-size and fit onto a single iPhone-screen-sized window and get a screenshot. </p>  <p>So the problem I'm having is trying to get an image of all the cells in a collection view, both on-screen and off-screen. I'm aware that off-screen cells don't actually exist, but I'd be interested in a way to kind of fake an image and draw in the data (if that's possible in swift). </p>  <p>In short, is there a way to programmatically create an image from a collection view and the cells it contains, both on and off screen with Swift?</p>
