<p>I'm working on some image processing algorithms and check the result with</p>  <pre><code>    imgView = UIImageView()     imgView.animationDuration = 3.33     imgView.animationRepeatCount = 0     imgView.animationImages = []     dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue()) {         for i in 1...264 {             self.imgView.animationImages?.append(UIImage(named: "002test_frame\(i)")!)         }         self.initGoButton("startImgSeq")     } </code></pre>  <p>And so after processing I see the result in action. But I need to indicate the number of frame currently shown during animation. So, how can I subscribe to some event which indicates that the anumation image changed in the UIImageView?</p>  <p>I don't need the completion of the while anoimation but rather the change of a frame inside the animation.</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
