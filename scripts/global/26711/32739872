<p>I am working on an app using Parse as backend. Whenever I try to load an image the NSData that I get is not empty but whenever I try converting it to an UIImage the image I get is <strong>nil</strong>.  </p>  <p>I already checked all the images on Parse and I can see/get all of them from the database. I also re-uploaded the images just in case something was wrong with them.  </p>  <p>Here is the piece of code I get the NSData and convert it to UIImage: </p>  <pre><code>let myImage = object.objectForKey("imagem") as! PFFile myImage.getDataInBackgroundWithBlock({(imageData : NSData?, error : NSError?) -&gt; Void in                 if error == nil {                     if let imageData = imageData{                             if let newImage = UIImage(data: imageData){                                 myClass.imagem = newImage                             }                             }                     }                     self.collectionView?.reloadData()                 }) </code></pre>
