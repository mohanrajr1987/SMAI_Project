<p>I have a problem with the positioning of the elements inside a table cell. They change their position when I leaf through the table. I installed autoresizhe and indicated where they should be, but nalazeyut pictures to the text and I do not know how to fix them. I read a lot of articles but could not find a solution which is suitable for different devices. Please help me. I have text and pictures change position on their own, when I leaf through or loaded a new cell in the table. <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/z8jAk.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/z8jAk.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>i add fixed size for uiimageview inside cellForRowAtIndexPath:</p>  <pre><code> [cell.imageView setFrame:CGRectMake(0,0,self.view.frame.size.width,cell.imageView.frame.size.height)]; </code></pre>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/YZPvd.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/YZPvd.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/aglvx.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/aglvx.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>UPDATE: i fixed my xib file.
