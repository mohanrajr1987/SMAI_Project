<p>I am trying to upload image with size of 80 to 100 kb but unfortunately below code is not working as expected,</p>  <pre><code>imageData = UIImageJPEGRepresentation(image, compression);  </code></pre>  <p>I have tried to change compression even to 0.001 but <code>imageData</code> is not compressed less than 307 kb.</p>  <p>Is there another way to change <code>UIImage</code> to <code>NSData</code> down to 80-100kb?</p>
