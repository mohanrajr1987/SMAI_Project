<p>I have an app that has a image crop view. The user can draw a path and then the path is masked out of the image, and a new image is saved using ImageContext. The problem is that the image can also be mirrored and rotated but after cropping the images center stays the same so it mirrors/rotates around its original axis. If you crop a section on the far left side of the image then mirroring the image with make it jump position dramatically. So I need to either cut the image way down after crop to only the cropped section, or reset the pivot to the center of the cropped portion. Does anyone here know how to implement this? Below is the crop code:</p>  <pre><code>    [drawView CropImage];     self.cropPath = drawView.cropPath;     CAShapeLayer *shapeLayer = [CAShapeLayer layer];     shapeLayer.path = self.cropPath.CGPath;     [self.layer setMask:shapeLayer];     UIGraphicsBeginImageContext(self.bounds.size);     [self.layer renderInContext:UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext()];     UIImage *image = UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext();      UIGraphicsEndImageContext();     self.EditImage = image; </code></pre>
