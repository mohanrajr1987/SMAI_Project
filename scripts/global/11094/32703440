<p>I am making a small project to build my skills, and what I am trying to do is query a DataSet which is filled from a SQL database using a SELECT query.</p>  <p>However, I cannot manage to query the dataset further, I would like to be able to search the dataset and it will pull up results, this is what I have so far, though I get this error - An unhandled exception of type 'System.NullReferenceException' occurred</p>  <p>My table is called Animals, and I am searching in the parlour_number column.</p>  <p>I have searched, but I don't understand most of what I have looked at, I have a very basic understanding still.</p>  <pre><code>DataSet ds; DataRow dRow;  private void searchBtn_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)     {         string searchFor = tbSearch.Text;         int results = 0;         DataRow[] returnedRows;          returnedRows = ds.Tables["Animals"].Select("parlour_number='" + searchFor + "'");          results = returnedRows.Length;          if(results &gt; 0)         {             dRow = returnedRows[0];              MessageBox.Show(dRow[1].ToString() + " " + dRow[2].ToString());         }         else         {             MessageBox.Show("No records found");         }     } </code></pre>
