<p>Please do not block me for this question, i tried to find the answer for about a month and i can not find it and you are my last hope(please if you want to report it at first answer me and then report,thanks). I write an Hybrid text classification code in MATLAB and i did it correct but now i do not know how to evaluate the results. I know nothing about training set and examination set in Reuters-21578 and i can not understand them. my code finds the keywords in a text and with the help of a hybrid KNN algorithm put the text in its accurate class but the problem is that i do not know what are these candidate classes?should i make them or they are ready? If each .sgm file in Reuters-21578 is a class then how can i use them as a candidate class, i mean they are full of words, so should i classify them first and reach to choosen classes that other documents can be classified according to them?</p>
