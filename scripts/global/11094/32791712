<p>I have a data set that contains age (in years), gender (<code>male=1</code> and <code>female=2</code>), marital status (<code>single=1</code>, <code>married=2</code>, <code>divorced=3</code> and <code>widow=4</code>), educational level (<code>primary=1</code>, <code>secondary=2</code> and <code>college/univ=3</code>), CD4 counts (<code>range from = 0 - 1600 cells/mm3</code>), emotional distress (measured on <code>scale of 0 - 100</code>), financial difficulty (measured on <code>scale of 0 - 100</code>) and social support (measured on <code>scale of 0 - 44</code>). Please how can I transform these variable into the same scale of measurement to enable me run an Exploratory Factor analysis?</p>  <p>Your scholarly advice on this is highly welcome.</p>  <p>Ismai</p>
