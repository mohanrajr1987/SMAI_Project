<p>Is there a way to find the index of a variable in SPSS Python?</p>  <p>For example, if one of my variables in the SPSS dataset is <code>ID</code> usually, I would be able to access the variable with the following code:</p>  <pre><code>varObj = datasetObj.varlist[0] </code></pre>  <p>Assuming that <code>ID</code> is the first column in my dataset.</p>  <p>But what if the variable <code>ID</code> is lost somewhere in the middle of a dataset?<br> Is there a way for me to find the index value of the variable <code>ID</code>?</p>  <p>Thank you very much for your help.</p>
