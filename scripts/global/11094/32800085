<p>I manage to select all variables that contains an specific string in its name by:</p>  <pre><code>df[grep("string1|string2",names(df))] </code></pre>  <p>But what I really want to do is to keep those variables and drop the rest. I can do:</p>  <pre><code>df2&lt;-df[grep("string1|string2",names(df))] </code></pre>  <p>But was wondering if I could simply drop those variables I am not interested in instead of creating another data frame. I tried:</p>  <pre><code>null&lt;-X_total[grep("!(mean|std)",names(X_total)) </code></pre>  <p>But did not work.</p>
