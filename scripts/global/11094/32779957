The problem is when I publish the project: it works on some computers, but on others it gives me this error: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Failed to connect database "Database1"</p> </blockquote>  <p>Once I click on Login it shows this error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Cannot Perform this operation on a closed dataset</p> </blockquote>  <ul> <li>Application works on Computer A (where I created this application in both run and even after I publish and try works perfectly)</li> <li>Computer B (working normally as a published application)</li> <li>Computer C Laptop (working normally as a published application )</li> <li>Computer D and so on i see get this error:  <blockquote>   <p>Failed to connect database "Database1"</p> </blockquote></li> </ul>
