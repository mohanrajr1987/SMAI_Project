<p>I have used the call below to "join" my datasets based on an inequality condition: </p>  <pre><code>library(sqldf)  sqldf("select * from dataset1 a, dataset2 b a.col1 &lt;= b.col2") </code></pre>  <p>However, is there a way I can do this without <strong>sqldf</strong>?</p>  <p>So far, I can only see merge functions that are based on simple joins on a particular common column.</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
