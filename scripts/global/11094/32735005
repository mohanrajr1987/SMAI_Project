<p>I was wonder how I'd update a specific well in a database (the balance cell), when all I know is the users account number.</p>  <p>I don't know where about in the database this will be. I just know the account number exists as I've logged in through it.</p>  <p>I need to use LINQ for this, and I've tried querying the database to find the balance. Although, I want to update the balance to a specific value, not find the current value.</p>  <p>In SQL, I'd do something like:</p>  <pre><code>UPDATE UserData SET Balance = some value in this case an int being passed in WHERE AccNo = the accountNumber variable stored in a global class </code></pre>  <p>But the problem is the value is stored in a dataset as the client is working offline with the data. His dataset is updated in the SQL database once he logs out. I was going to do this by retrieving everything from the database and going an update/merge statement.</p>  <p>Any idea how to resolve this?</p>
