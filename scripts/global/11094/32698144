<p>I have a data set which has 2 data tables.Both these tables are retrieved from 2 distinct Oracle Databases (physically and logically separate).</p>  <p>I need to do a Inner Join on these two tables which reside in 1 dataset. And then display the result in a gridview.</p>  <p>Are there any possibilities of doing SQL Joins on tables inside a Dataset? </p>  <p>If yes, does anyone have a worked out example? If not, can someone point me in the right direction - I do not wish to do any "hacks" (manually looping thru and other iterations of that sorts) as I believe there will be a way to do it within the environment, just need the right approach.</p>  <p>This is in VB .net so would appreciate a more relevant code BUT any help is highly appreciated.</p>
