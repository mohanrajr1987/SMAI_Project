<p>I would like to read in R the following dataset from this link(<a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2" rel="nofollow">https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2</a>). I tried to display the dataset in text format or csv format, but I have not been able to to it. Also, the file is too big to be contained in only one Excel CSV file. I am interested toward the observations from 2015. My purpose is to built some code that could be execute by anyone who have access to Internet. That's why I want to extract and manipulate the dataset by some command lines on R.</p>  <p>I have been working on this for many hours. Any hints or solutions would be really appreciate.</p>
