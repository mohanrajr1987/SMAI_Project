<p>I have written following code to create DataSet:</p>  <pre><code>    Dim connectionString As String = "********"     Dim conn As New SqlConnection(connectionString)     conn.Open()      Try         Dim cmd As SqlCommand = conn.CreateCommand         cmd.CommandText = "SELECT * FROM TABCODE WHERE TABCODE_FUNNUM='AAAREN02'"         Dim adp As SqlDataAdapter = New SqlDataAdapter(cmd)         Dim ds As DataSet = New DataSet          adp.Fill(ds)      Catch ex As Exception      End Try </code></pre>  <p>In this, the last line adp.Fill(ds) in VS2015 is highlighted as an error with :</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Overload resolution failed because no accessible 'Fill' can be called with these arguments</p> </blockquote>  <p>What am I doing wrong???</p>  <p>I have also imported the followings:</p>  <pre><code>Imports System Imports System.Data Imports System.Data.SqlClient </code></pre>
