<p>I'm doing academic research on social network esp. face book. </p>  <p>But, looking for data sets(need not be v large) that contain nodes, edges and esp. lots of user attributes and may be posts. Importantly, challenge is our research is focused on finding user behavior so we need snapshots of same data set to observe.  I tried Stanford data(Snap) and others but have only one snapshot. </p>  <p>Also, I also want to understand how features mapped in Stanford data(snap). Please help me out. </p>  <p>Thank you!</p>
