<p>I've tried so many different things based on what I found online and still can't do this. There are similar questions that I have tried to piece together but it's still not working. Here is what I have so far:</p>  <pre><code>class CustomUITextView: UITextView {   override func paste(sender: AnyObject?) {      let data: NSData? = UIPasteboard.generalPasteboard().dataForPasteboardType("public.png")     if data != nil {         let attributedString = self.attributedText.mutableCopy() as! NSMutableAttributedString         let textAttachment = NSTextAttachment()         textAttachment.image = UIImage(data: data!)         let attrStringWithImage = NSAttributedString(attachment: textAttachment)         attributedString.replaceCharactersInRange(self.selectedRange, withAttributedString: attrStringWithImage)         self.attributedText = attributedString      } else {          let pasteBoard: UIPasteboard = UIPasteboard.generalPasteboard()         let text = NSAttributedString(string: pasteBoard.string!)         let attributedString = self.attributedText.mutableCopy() as! NSMutableAttributedString         attributedString.replaceCharactersInRange(self.selectedRange, withAttributedString: text)         self.attributedText = attributedString     } } } </code></pre>  <p>Also, my IBOutlet for the textView is in another file and is of this custom type I created:</p>  <pre><code>@IBOutlet var textView: CustomUITextView! </code></pre>  <p>I created a subclass of UITextView and assigned it to my textview. I then override the paste function to allow for images since I read that UITextField does not support image pasting by default. This is currently working for the text but not the image ---> if I do a long press gesture to show the Menu, the "Paste" button never shows up if there is an image in the PasteBoard; it only shows if there is text. </p>  <p>Ultimately, I want to paste PNG, JPEGS, and images from URLS in my textview. Someone please help !!</p>
