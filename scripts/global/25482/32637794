<p>I am trying un the past two days to implement a UITextView that grows as the user types. Like whats-app does. </p>  <p>I've found examples here with textViewDidChange but that didn't really work as it needs to not only grow but also move upwards. And as the textview sits inside a view that also holds the send button, they both have to grow upwards.</p>  <p>Also found some other frameworks.</p>  <p><a href="https://github.com/slackhq/SlackTextViewController" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/slackhq/SlackTextViewController</a> - looks really cool and may do everything I need but I found no examples of it running swift. The sample project provided I could not run.</p>  <p><a href="https://github.com/MatejBalantic/MBAutoGrowingTextView" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/MatejBalantic/MBAutoGrowingTextView</a> - could not really get it to work upwards.</p>  <p>I am looking for some help on how to implement that using SWIFT or maybe a sample project of the SLACK one running on swift that is not the sample project on github. Or maybe a bit of code showing how to link the UITextView to the Slack class and make it work inside a viewController class. </p>
