<p>Starting from iOS 9 (I used Xcode 7.0 beta 6 (7A192o)), an Objective-C app with UITextView will hang <strong>if the text view's text is less than 10 characters</strong>. CPU usage goes up to 99-100% and the whole system hangs.</p>  <p><strong>How to reproduce:</strong></p>  <ol> <li>Create a brand new single view app from template (or anything else).</li> <li>In storyboard, add a UITextView with default settings anywhere in the main view.</li> <li>Set the text to a string that is less than 10 characters long.</li> <li>Launch the app in simulator (any device, as long as it's iOS 9).</li> <li>Upon launch, before displaying the single view, the system will hang and CPU usage will go to maximum forever.</li> <li>Set the text to any other text that's more than 10 characters and the app runs correctly.a</li> </ol>  <p>Looks like constraints or any other settings do not affect this behaviour.</p>  <p>The immediate solution would be to simply not have less than 10 characters, but, well, that's lame.</p>  <p>You can check out <a href="https://github.com/7mllm7/UITextViewTenCharsBug" rel="nofollow">this github repository</a> that also demonstrates the problem.</p>  <p>I also submitted a bug report to Apple (bug no. 22736256, although you probably can't see it there yet).</p>  <p>Weirdest. Bug. Ever.</p>  <p><strong>Is anyone also encountering this one??</strong></p>
