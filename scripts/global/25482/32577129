<p>I am attempting to change the <code>contentInsets</code> property of a <code>UITextView</code> upon they keyboard showing, so that it is not hidden behind the keyboard. I have looked at a number of questions concerning this task, and have tried following the approved or highly voted answers, and have tried following Apple's recommended approach:</p>  <p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/StringsTextFonts/Conceptual/TextAndWebiPhoneOS/KeyboardManagement/KeyboardManagement.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009542-CH5-SW7" rel="nofollow">https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/StringsTextFonts/Conceptual/TextAndWebiPhoneOS/KeyboardManagement/KeyboardManagement.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009542-CH5-SW7</a></p>  <p>My code is currently as follows, in ViewDidLoad():</p>  <pre><code>NSNotificationCenter.defaultCenter().addObserver(self, selector: "keyboardWillShow:", name: UIKeyboardWillShowNotification, object: nil) </code></pre>  <p>the function that is indicated by the selector is:</p>  <pre><code>func keyboardWillShow(notification : NSNotification){     let info :NSDictionary = notification.userInfo! as NSDictionary;     if let keyboardRect = info.objectForKey(UIKeyboardFrameEndUserInfoKey){         var inset = commentsText.contentInset;         inset.bottom = keyboardRect.size.height         UIView.animateWithDuration(0.25, animations: {             self.commentsText.contentInset = inset         })     } } </code></pre>  <p><code>commentsText</code> is the name of the <code>UITextView</code> I am trying to adjust the innocence of. </p>  <p>The problem I am having is that when attempting to access <code>keyboardRect.size.heigh</code> I have a fatal error of attempting to unwrap an unexpected nil value. I really am not sure how to fix this, because as far as I can tell I am following accepted answers and documentation (The animation block is an addition to Apple's documentation, but it is from an accepted answer, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23988866/how-do-i-resize-views-when-keyboard-pops-up-using-auto-layout/23992055#23992055">How do I resize views when keyboard pops up using Auto Layout</a> , so I figure it probably isn't the source of the problem. </p>  <p>I have also attempted using the <code>UIKeyboardDidShowNotification</code> as well as using the <code>UIKeyboardFrameBeginUserInfoKey</code>, but neither of those substitutions changed the error.  The documentation from Apple and most questions/answers on this topic are in Objective-C, and while I think I correctly "translated" them into Swift for my purposes, it is entirely possible I made a mistake somewhere, if this is the case please let me know what my error was. </p>  <p>Any help/suggestions would be appreciated. </p>  <p>Thanks in advance. </p>  <p>P.S. I am currently working in Xcode 7 Beta 6</p>
