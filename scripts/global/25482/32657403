<p>According to my observation, in XCode 7, if you put a UITextView in storyboard, and if the default text is less than 10 characters, the view controller won't load, and XCode throws no exception either - the app just hangs there. </p>  <p>I found it while migrating one of my XCode 6 project to XCode 7, and spent a lot of time to get there. I also started a clean slate project to confirm this behavior, and hope to put here to see if anybody else can confirm this?</p>
