<p>I have created an iPhone app in Xcode,using objective C,that parses json content to a UITableView,from the UITableview,a user can also access the detail view..but now on the detail view the story content in the uitextview overlaps onto the uiimage view when the story is long,but when the story being parsed is short,it fits well on the app screen below that image but creates a big space between the image view and the uitextview..Can anybody assist me..i am not sure how to fix this and i can't upload images to show you because i don't have enough badges.PLeaes don't vote me down..have mercy on a freshman.</p>
