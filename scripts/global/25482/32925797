<p>I would like to plot sentences in <code>UITextView</code> not like consecutive lines, but like patches. Like below. When user press on the top left corner of textview and start to type "hello world I am here", then textview will break into 2-3 lines the sentence, and plot under each other, like below on the picture. How is it possible? Is it in App Store any text editor that offer this feature already? </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ha6c5.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ha6c5.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
