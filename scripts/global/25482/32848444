<p>Fortunately it's very easy to set the edge insets on a UITextView...</p>  <pre><code>@IBOutlet var tv:UITextView! override func awakeFromNib()     {     super.awakeFromNib()     tv.textContainerInset = UIEdgeInsetsMake(0,0,0,0);                                         // top, left, bottom, right     } </code></pre>  <p>However even when set to zero all round, there is still a small inset!</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/2m0Bt.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/2m0Bt.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Notice that with UILabel, it is tight, there is no inset.  With UITextView, there is still a small inset, even when textContainerInset is set to zero.</p>  <p>How to get rid of that remaining inset?</p>
