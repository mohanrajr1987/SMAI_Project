<p>I have an application that uses Sqlite as the db. This app has worked for a few years with no problem. With the release of iOS 9, I cannot save any of the UITextviews to the database. Everything else still saves with no problems. The app returns no error when saving and it looks like everything works, but when I look in the database the fields have null values for any data that is a blob. Does anyone know what the issue is?</p>  <p>This is not much help because this problem is with all my apps now with iOS 9 and UITextview saving. Here's a snippet of code:</p>  <pre><code>    sqlite3_stmt *statement;     const char *dbpath = [databasePath UTF8String];      if (sqlite3_open(dbpath, &amp;BratAppsDB) == SQLITE_OK) {         const char* sqliteQuery = "UPDATE MyDatabase SET TheTextView=? Where ID='1'";          if (sqlite3_prepare_v2(BratAppsDB, sqliteQuery, -1, &amp;statement, NULL) == SQLITE_OK) {             sqlite3_bind_blob(statement, 1, [TheUITextView.text UTF8String], -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);              sqlite3_step(statement);             sqlite3_reset(statement);         } else {             NSLog(@"Error is: %s", sqlite3_errmsg(BratAppsDB));         }          sqlite3_finalize(statement);         sqlite3_close(MyDB);     }         </code></pre>
