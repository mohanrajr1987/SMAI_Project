<p>For UITextView, UITextField</p>  <p>you want to be able to control when the <strong>"Return"</strong> key is available ...</p>  <p>so typically when the user has entered <strong>less than say five characters</strong>, you want the Return key to be unavailable; once over five characters you want the Return key to be available.</p>  <p>(Note - of course, obviously, you can just set "auto-enable Return key" and Apple will do what I describe for a length of "1")</p>  <p>Is there finally a way to do this in iOS9 ??</p>  <p>I believe <code>setReturnKeyEnabled</code> was/is? a private method with App Store rejection?</p>
