<p>I want my <code>UITextView</code> font size to fill the width of the view.  </p>  <p>So if I have the text:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>"I wish I \n<br>   knew what \n<br>   I was doing"</p> </blockquote>  <p>I would hope it would expand to be a good size for the width of the device.</p>  <p><code>UILabel</code>s have <code>adjustsFontSizeToFitWidth</code> but if I make a separate label for each line then the font sizes will be different because the strings are different lengths.</p>  <p>How do I pick the right size programmatically?</p>
