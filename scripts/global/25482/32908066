<p>I have some strings in the following format: </p>  <p>There is ______ appels</p>  <p>There is ______ cows and ______ sheep</p>  <p>There is ______ red flowers, ______ green flowers and ______ yellow flowers</p>  <p>Where the ______ represents the editable part of the string. </p>  <p>These strings is contained in a UITextView, but I only want the ______ fields to be editable and the rest of the strings readonly.</p>  <p>I have tried to implement the <code>"textView(textView: UITextView, shouldChangeTextInRange range: NSRange, replacementText text: String)"</code> method in order to restrict the edit in the range where the ______ is present. But I am having some trouble calculating the range of the ______ strings. </p>  <p>I have subclassed UITextView, added a  variable: </p>  <pre><code>var characterWhereEditIsAllowed: Character = "_" </code></pre>  <p>and tried to calculate the range from the first occurence of the "characterWhereEditIsAllowed" to the last like so:   </p>  <pre><code>guard let editableChracter = editableCharacter else {    return }  guard let idx = text.characters.indexOf(editableChracter) else {    return }  editableCharacterStartIndex = text.startIndex.distanceTo(idx) </code></pre>  <p>I am stuck finding the index of the last occurrence of "_" in the textview text. The help is appreciated.   </p>  <p>P.S: I have tried using the "rangeOfString" method, but since the "______" fields are various sized, I can't check on that specific length "string". </p>
