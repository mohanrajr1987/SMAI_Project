<p>I have a UITextView showing some dynamic content that can vary in size.  The textview has no scrolling allowed and its size is independent from the content. Given its auto-layout constraints, the text view has a different horizontal size on iphone5 and iPhone6plus for example.</p>  <p>What I would like is my text to be clipped when necessary with 3 dots at the end like that “…”. (there is a "More" UIButton launching safari below the UITextView)</p>  <p>I’m not sure if there is a UITextView property or if i should consider some code that checks how many characters the textview can display in the current circumstances and modify my string to be shown accordingly (cutting and appending @“…”).</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
