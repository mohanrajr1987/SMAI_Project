<p>Moving my project over to Xcode 7 caused the project to hang in 2 places both where a new UITableViewController subclass should have been presented. It seems to be a bug in Xcode 7 and is also present in 7.01, The project worked fine in Xcode 6.4.</p>  <p>This bug doesn't throw an exception, things just seem too hang.</p>  <p>Wading thru the code line by line it became clear that in both cases there was an issue returning a UITableViewCell with UITextView's upon the tableviewCell.</p>
