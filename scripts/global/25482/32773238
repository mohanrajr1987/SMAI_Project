<p>I need to listen for taps on a UITextView (even when the keyboard is already up). So I added a tap gesture recognizer to it.</p>  <pre><code>UITapGestureRecognizer *textTap = [[UITapGestureRecognizer alloc] initWithTarget:self action:@selector(_textViewTapped:)]; textTap.cancelsTouchesInView = NO; UITextView *_textView = [[UITextView alloc] init]; [_textView addGestureRecognizer:textTap]; </code></pre>  <p>The gesture fires correctly, but the standard cursor moving behavior is broken. You're supposed to be able to tap any part of the text and move the cursor there. After adding the tap gesture, I couldn't move the cursor with a single tap anymore. Long tap to move the cursor still works, but that's unrelated. Wasn't <code>cancelsTouchesInView = NO</code> supposed to preserve the standard tap events?</p>
