<p>I am trying to send and update strings inside a UITextView using and IBAction button.</p>  <p>the code below works fine however, every time i push the button the old text is replaced with the new one. What I am trying to do is to always append the text to the exiting one.</p>  <p>Any Idea?</p>  <pre><code>@IBAction func equalPressed(sender: AnyObject) {          var resultString:String = "new string"          textView.text = resultString.stringByAppendingString("= " + resultLabel.text! + ";")      } </code></pre>
