<p>I am using a UITextView with an NSAttributedString that contains links. I set the attributes I want to have for links. Unfortunately these are ignored by the UITextView and the linkTextAttributes of UITextView are used. Fine. But Is there a way to tell the UITextView to use the original color of the string for the link, not just one? Problem is that I have two text colors (for quotes and text) and if there is a link in the quote it will be displayed in the color set in the linkTextAttributes not in the original one.</p>  <p>Thanks for your help, Philip</p>
