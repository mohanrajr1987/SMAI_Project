<p>I'm experiencing a weird issue with my Swift 2.0 app.</p>  <p>I have a (editable) <code>UITextView</code> defined in my storyboard. If I leave the <code>text</code> property empty in the storyboard everything is working as expected. But when I enter the text <code>Kaasje</code> (in the storyboard and recompiling), the app freezes when loading the nib (navigating through segue) and the CPU jumps to 100% (the app remains stuck). The app will never reach <code>viewDidLoad</code> at this point.</p>  <p>It makes no difference when changing between fonts or fontsizes, behavior remains.</p>  <p>Pausing in Xcode does not leave me with anything useful, the main thread is busy without specifying any function. Nothing is logged to output nor any logs are created.</p>  <p>I'm running iOS9 on a iPad Air, the app has a built target of iOS8 and runs landscape-only.</p>  <p>Has anyone ever experienced anything like this before, and might have an explanation for this behaviour?</p>  <p>As far as my assumptions: Something goes wrong when calculating the text-size which results in a infinite loop while either calculating the size or adjusting the frame.</p>  <p>P.S. It happens with other texts too, but "Kaasje" always fails. It seems to fail when the the text is only 1 line. Longer texts tend to succeed aswel as leaving it empty.</p>
