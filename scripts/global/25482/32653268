<p>I'm testing my app on an iPod Touch running iOS 9 (on iOS 8.4 it was working for other functions: FaceTime, copy to contacts, etc.). I have a textview with phone number detection and I receive the following error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Warning: Attempt to present &lt;_UIRotatingAlertController: 0x16250e00> on  whose view is not in the window hierarchy!</p>      <p>Assertion failure in -[UITextView startInteractionWithLinkAtPoint:], /BuildRoot/Library/Caches/com.apple.xbs/Sources/UIKit/UIKit-3505.16/UITextView_LinkInteraction.m:377</p> </blockquote>  <p>Any fix to this?</p>
