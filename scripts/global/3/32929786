<p>I have created a dynamic route in <code>AngularJS</code> which allows all routes to be processed via a single <code>PHP</code> file. The reason I do this is because, I don't like how you can navigate to the raw <code>templateUrl</code> and see an unstyled partial page. </p>  <p>Before I learnt <code>Angular</code>, I had <code>Ajax</code> requests <code>POST</code>ing to the <code>PHP</code> file, but I can't seem to do this with <code>Angular</code>. I have made it so the requests go to <code>/router.php?page=XX</code>... but even still, this URL now has to accept GET requests. </p>  <p>Can I not make it so that the <code>templateUrl</code> is loaded via a POST request?</p>
