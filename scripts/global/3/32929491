<p>I can get my program to display all the previous calculations however I want to limit it to the most recent 10.</p>  <p>Here is my problem...</p>  <pre><code>Template.keypad.helpers({     previous: function() { return previous.find(); } }); </code></pre>  <p>I tried replacing it with this...</p>  <pre><code>Template.keypad.helpers({     previous: function() { return previous.sort({_id:1}).limit(10);} }); </code></pre>  <p>However when I implement the second block of code it doesn't display any of the items in my collection.</p>  <p>What can I do to make this work? Thank you.</p>
