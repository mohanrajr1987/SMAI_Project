<p>I am trying to enable my javascript code to download json files from my Amazon S3 account. My S3 CORS configuration looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;CORSConfiguration xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/"&gt;     &lt;CORSRule&gt;         &lt;AllowedOrigin&gt;https://www.example.com&lt;/AllowedOrigin&gt;         &lt;AllowedMethod&gt;GET&lt;/AllowedMethod&gt;     &lt;/CORSRule&gt; &lt;/CORSConfiguration&gt; </code></pre>  <p>My relevant javascript code (served from <a href="https://www.example.com" rel="nofollow">https://www.example.com</a> for this example) looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>var req = new XMLHttpRequest();  req.open('GET', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/mybucket/myfile.json', true); req.withCredentials = true; req.onload = function () { ... }; req.onerror = function () { ... }; req.send(); </code></pre>  <p>Note that this example is specific to browsers that support the "withCredentials" field.</p>  <p>The request fails with status 404. I've verified that the S3 json file being requested is indeed accessible and displays properly when its url is entered in a browser.</p>  <p>Does anyone see what I'm missing?</p>  <p><strong>Update:</strong> I created a simple, new javascript file to do further testing, and the test code worked fine. So, the example code shown above works, I just need to determine how my actual code is different. Sorry for the unnecessary distraction caused by my question, but hopefully the code example will prove useful to someone down the road.</p>
