<p>I Enabled CORS for Web Api and also added custom headers to web.config, but I keep getting the error:</p>  <p><code>No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://localhost:59445' is therefore not allowed access. The response had HTTP status code 503.</code></p>  <p>In my WebApi Controller, I have this at the top of my controller:</p>  <p><code>[EnableCors("*", "*", "*")]</code></p>  <p>I specified the following in my Web Api web.config (I did not put anyting in the website web.config):</p>  <pre><code>&lt;customHeaders&gt;   &lt;add name="Access-Control-Allow-Origin" value="*" /&gt;   &lt;add name="Access-Control-Allow-Headers" value="*" /&gt;   &lt;add name="Access-Control-Allow-Methods" value="POST" /&gt; &lt;/customHeaders&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I am calling <code>config.EnableCors()</code> in my <code>WebApiConfig.cs</code>.  When I inspect the response headers in chrome or firefox, I don't see the <code>Access-Controll-Allow-Origin</code> header.  Is there something I am missing?</p>  <p>I decided to start all over to try to reproduce the problem.  These are the steps I took:</p>  <ol> <li>I removed the CORS packages</li> <li>I then tried accessing the api on localhost and got the error as expcted.</li> <li>I reinstalled the CORS pacakges and made the configfurations.</li> <li>I tried again with localhost and it worked fine, no cross domain error.</li> <li>I deployed to my website and api and when I try to access the api via the website, I get the cross domain error.  My api has the following naming structure:  <code>api.sub.website.com</code></li> </ol>  <p>I am deploying to azure, so I am stumped now and not sure what other options I have?</p>
