<p>I am familiar with CORS and Access-Control-Allow-* headers.</p>  <p>I am making a CORS XHR request that has a new Geoposition header previously not specified within the OPTIONS response Access-Control-Allow-Headers header.</p>  <p>When I attach my client to a new service instance, the OPTIONS and POST requests work.</p>  <p>When I attach my client to an older service instance, the OPTIONS response has code 200 but the POST is failed by Chrome with code 0 and</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Request header field Geoposition is not allowed by   Access-Control-Allow-Headers.</p> </blockquote>  <p>How do I inspect the OPTIONS response headers (within onResponseRecieved?) so that I can omit/remove the offending Geoposition header and resubmit the request?</p>
