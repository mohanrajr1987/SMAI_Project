<p>I have two web-servers responding on two different ports. I have the main web server that serves a website with a lot of javascript behind HTTP digest authentication, the secondary webserver only executes CGIs that can be directly accessed, always by using HTTP digest, or that can accessed with CORS by the ajax requests related to the main webserver. Both servers share the same users credentials.</p>  <p>My problem is that I don't want the browser to prompt for credentials when the javascript is making requests to the secondary webserver.</p>  <p>I came out with the idea that I could add some special header in the ajax request to the secondary web-server, and if this header is present I can ignore the HTTP authentication. Since the servers share the users credentials, if the user is able to log in into the main web-server, he'll be able to login into the second one as well.</p>  <p>Using a fixed header is of course useless. So the question is: is there a mechanism in CORS to tell the secondary webserver that the user is already authenticated in the first one? Something like a safe way to exchange tokens in cookies?</p>
