<p>I need to make a post call to a RDF graph, updating some data. If I use Ajax in jQuery and call directly the service, I get a 'No 'access-control-allowed-origin' ecc.ecc.' warning in console, but the update is successful.</p>  <p>I know that this worning is due to the same-origin policy, and I 'avoid' it in 'GET' calls using 'jsonp' format; I don't know how to avoid it in 'POST' calls. After some research online, I found out that client-side the only solution (if you don't have access to the server code, as in my case) is to use an IFrame snippet; I can't for many reasons.</p>  <p>The only solution that remains to me is to make the Ajax call to a local PHP file (as I already do for other reasons) and then from there contact the remote server and make the 'POST' call.</p>  <p>Does anyone know if there are other ways? If not, do you have any idea on how to make a cross-domain post call from php?</p>
