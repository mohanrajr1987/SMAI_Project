<p>I am using LibCurl/C++ to send and receive html requests. One of the servers I access returns back this header information Access-Control-Expose-Headers: X-Custom1, where X-Custom1 is a custom header to provide data that I need to parse. But I am not seeing any value for X-Custom1. </p>  <p>I tried requesting it specifically by adding Access-Control-Request-Headers: X-Custom1 header in my curl c++ request. But no use. </p>  <p>Response header data:</p>  <pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 Server: &lt;server name&gt; Date: Thu, 01 Oct 2015 06:43:06 GMT Content-Type: application/json Transfer-Encoding: chunked Connection: keep-alive Set-Cookie: &lt;cookie data&gt;; expires=Fri, 30-Sep-16 06:43:05 GMT; path=/;     domain=&lt;domain name&gt;; HttpOnly Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Authorization,Content-Type,Accept,Origin,User-Agent Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, OPTIONS, PUT, DELETE Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * Access-Control-Expose-Headers: X-Custom1 Access-Control-Max-Age: 1728000 Etag: W/"&lt;tag data&gt;" CF-RAY: &lt;ray data&gt; Content-Encoding: gzip </code></pre>  <p>Anyone know how to get the X-Custom1 data ?  I have been stuck at this for a long time now and need help.  Forgive me if this could be a cross post or wrongly tagged. I am not sure where else to post this question. </p>  <p>Thanks in advance. </p>
