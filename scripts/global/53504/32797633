<p><a href="https://spring.io/blog/2015/06/08/cors-support-in-spring-framework" rel="nofollow">Spring 4.2 has CORS support</a>, however allowed Origin(s) must be set manually. Which is problematic when combined with authentication, because authentication not supported with <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *</code>.</p>  <p>How to set this automatically? Very useful for Ionic/Cordova clients.</p>  <p>i.e. if client sends <code>Origin: assets-library://whatever/</code> then server will send <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: assets-library://whatever/</code></p>  <p>Feature request: <a href="https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-13511" rel="nofollow">https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-13511</a></p>
