<p>On production, my app opens an iFrame of content hosted on my S3. Because of the CORS issues that comes up, I chose to mask my S3 Host to appear as a subdomain of my app with a CNAME. So by going to :</p>  <pre><code>host.mywebsite.com </code></pre>  <p>It's actually going to my S3 bucket also called <code>host.mywebsite.com</code> but it bypasses all my CORS issues because my site now believes it is local.</p>  <p>In order to test that it works though, I want to also set this up on my local. On my local, I use Rail's <a href="http://pow.cx/" rel="nofollow">POW</a> which allows me to use subdomains and host my local server. Would it be possible to somehow alias a specific subdomain as my remote S3 address?</p>  <p>In this way going to :</p>  <pre><code>https://host.mylocalVersionOfMyWebsite.dev/  </code></pre>  <p>..would actually access the remote S3 host but as my local site. This way, my local site, <code>mylocalApp.dev</code> would think that it's coming from the same domain, thus not having any CORS issues..</p>  <p>Using just Rails, I'm limited to just redirects. And some Rack Middleware gives the ability to write 301's but no aliases. I've also considered using /etc/hosts, but havn't had such luck.</p>
