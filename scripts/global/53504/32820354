<p>I am using fixer.io api for currency conversion api in my angularjs website. It was working good in the past. But in the recent times it started to produce the below error. </p>  <blockquote>   <p>xmlhttprequest cannot load no 'access-control-allow-origin'</p> </blockquote>  <p>So on research I found out the this is something to do with CORS. And few of them suggest using http.jsonp instead of http.get. But fixer.io doesn't support http.jsonp format.</p>  <p>Few also suggest to use the below headers in the config.js which did not help.</p>  <pre><code>delete $httpProvider.defaults.headers.common['X-Requested-With'] </code></pre>  <p>Many say that this is a server side thing and adding a header will not help. Is there a way to fix this problem from my side? Or if I switch to a different provider who support http.jsonp format, do you think it will solve this issue?</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>  <p><a href="http://api.fixer.io/latest?base=USD" rel="nofollow">API URL</a></p>
