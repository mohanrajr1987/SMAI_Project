<p>I am working to overcome cors issues with my Angular / Clojure app and I am having trouble unerstanding what syntax to use in order to avoid the Access-Control-Allow-Origin error for POST and GET requests</p>  <p>I have added this code to my clojure controller where my routes are found and it seems to fix the issue for GET requests:</p>  <pre><code>(POST "/node/create" request     (let [node_object (or (get-in request [:params :data])                           (get-in request [:body :data])                           "ROUTER_ERROR")]       {:status 200        :headers {"Content-Type" "application/json"}        :body (recursiftion.model/createNode node_object)       } ))  (defn allow-cross-origin     "middleware function to allow crosss origin"     [handler]     (fn [request]      (let [response (handler request)]       (assoc-in response [:headers "Access-Control-Allow-Origin"]            "*"))))  (def app  (-&gt; (handler/api app-routes)       (middleware/wrap-json-body {:keywords? true})       (middleware/wrap-json-response)       (allow-cross-origin))) </code></pre>  <p>And this Angular code</p>  <pre><code>this.post = function (object) {       console.log('BANG', object);      return $http({                 method: "post",                 url: "https://mywebserveraddress.com/node/create",                 data: object             });      }; </code></pre>  <p>But I still have related errors for my POST requests:</p>  <pre><code>preflight has invalid HTTP status code 404 </code></pre>  <p>I am looking for the right syntax to add to my clojure application in order for me to make cross domain ajax requests from my angular spa that will live on localhost for development and external servers from my production environment.</p>  <p>I am very grateful for help you can give.</p>
