<p>I am working on an asp.net mvc-5 web application, which is available to public users (no login is required) . and i need to prevent the same user from submitting more than 5 contact us requests within an hour. so i need a way to differentiate if the Request i am receiving  is coming from the same user or not. so i found the  <code>Request.UserHostAddress</code> , which will contain the user IP (if i am not wrong the public IP). but my question is will this value be unique per user all over the world ? or users might share this value ? if the answer is that  users might share the  <code>Request.UserHostAddress</code> , so which value will give me better way to "authenticate" the user ??  </p>
