<p>Hello I have tried countless other forums and the communities haven't been able to help me. So I'm here reaching out to you guys. Any feedback is appreciated.</p>  <h2>Problem:</h2>  <p>My windows 10 is getting caught in a boot sequence that takes up to 6-hours</p>  <h2>Solutions I have tried:</h2>  <p>-Running antiviruses including bitdefender 2015, malwarebytes, windows defender, iobits anti-malware, and avast</p>  <p>-Running full scans of all types in CC-cleaner, advanced systemcare, and wise 365.</p>  <p>-Running windows 10 start up repair using a windows media disk</p>  <p>-CHDSK</p>  <p>-Running registry cleaners/repair tools of all types such as windows regrepair, advanced systemcares reg cleaner, CC-cleaner reg tool, and wise's reg tool</p>  <p>-Enabling fast start up in control panel</p>  <h2>Explanation:</h2>  <p>So I upgraded to windows 10 the day it was released and everything went pretty smoothly. However a month or so ago it became infected by a virus that downloaded countless other viruses, my solution to this was to use bitdefender and advanced systemcare to clear my system of the viruses but by the time i deleted them the damage was done. </p>  <p>My windows 10 gets caught in a boot up sequence that takes up 6-hours just to reach the login screen. After trying to google it I ended up reinstalling windows 10 and losing all of my files in the process but hey it fixed my problem.</p>  <p>But yesterday the problem returned. Which leads me to believe its not a virus. I don't want to clean install again and lose all my files. Any ideas on what I can do to fix my problem?</p>
