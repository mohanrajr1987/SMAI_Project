<p>I'm using Ruby on Rails and Office 365 REST API to get messages with $search params. My request look like that</p>  <pre><code>https://outlook.office.com/api/v1.0/me/folders/inbox/messages?$search="oundatio‌n" </code></pre>  <p>This request can not search emails contain "Foundatio‌n", it just can find emails have exactly "oundatio‌n" word. I want to search all emails have words contain "oundatio‌n" like "Foundatio‌n", "Soundatio‌n"... <em>oundatio‌n</em> .... Could you help me? Thank you very much!</p>
