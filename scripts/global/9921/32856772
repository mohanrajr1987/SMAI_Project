<p>I'm trying to figure out how to find the total number of disk requests. I tried looking in /proc/stat but the disk_io field is non-existent. So now I'm looking in the /proc/diskstats file and it seems to be the right area, but I'm asking myself "do i add the read and writes issues?" or "Are read and writes the only requests counted?"</p>  <p>Maybe someone could break down the <code>/proc/diskstats</code> file for me. </p>
