<p>I have created a private message system for my social media network for my users, which is similar to Facebook.</p>  <p>Pretty much, I want it to work like Facebook... Click on the user and view the conversation, and be able to delete just that conversation with just that user.</p>  <p>I tried several ways, and my first php script deletes ALL private coversations, between ALL users they've had a conversation with instead of individual conversations...</p>  <p>Here's my php that deletes ALL conversations:</p>  <pre><code>   &lt;?php    error_reporting(0);    include "assets/includes/config.php";    $conn=mysql_connect($sql_host,$sql_user,$sql_pass);    mysql_select_db($sql_name,$conn);    $query1=mysql_query("DELETE FROM messages where  timeline_id='".$_REQUEST['timelineID']."'");    $query1=mysql_query("DELETE FROM messages where  recipient_id='".$_REQUEST['timelineID']."'");    header("location:index.php?tab1=messages");    ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>But, like I said, I need a way for a user to delete individual conversations, so I tried doing it this way, but it doesn't work:</p>  <p>Here's my php:</p>  <pre><code> &lt;?php   error_reporting(0);   include "assets/includes/config.php";   $conn=mysql_connect($sql_host,$sql_user,$sql_pass);   mysql_select_db($sql_name,$conn);   $query1=mysql_query("DELETE FROM messages where timeline_id='".$_REQUEST['timelineID']." AND recipient_id=" .  $_REQUEST['recipientID']);    header("location:index.php?tab1=messages");    ?&gt;           </code></pre>  <p>Any ideas, or am I doing something wrong? Thanks!</p>
