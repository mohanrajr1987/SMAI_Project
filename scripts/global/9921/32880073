<p>I'm trying to store CSRF protected (querystring + cookie) API POST requests for later replay when a webapp comes back online.</p>  <p>To do this, I want to save the Request Object (Fetch API) in IndexedDB, but IDBObjectStore.put fails with a DataCloneError "An object could not be cloned".</p>  <p>The Request object has a simple JSON body, no binary data, just all strings.<br> This is running in a service worker (a web worker) environment.</p>  <p><strong>Is there any reason why the structured cloning algorithm would not clone a Request Object? [<a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/infrastructure.html#structured-clone" rel="nofollow">Answer: Yes</a>] If so, what are my best options for dehydrating/rehydrating this object in lieu of structured cloning?</strong></p>  <p>I really want to avoid having to know/access individual properties of the Request object. The parts of the Request I'll need are url, headers, body, and cookie (but again, I don't want the code to have to know about that).</p>  <p>Thanks in advance for any advice.</p>
