<p>Is there any way to get the executed javascript contents from a webpage? I have tried requests + BeautifulSoup, mechanize, these yield me with "source code" of the webpage and not the executed javascript. For example, this website :- <a href="http://listen.tidal.com/login" rel="nofollow">http://listen.tidal.com/login</a></p>  <p>As you can see, in the source code, there is un-execute JS, but, when you inspect the element, you'll see the executed code.</p>  <p>Now, is there any way I could get that EXECUTED code in python? Hints please, because I have tried emulating a browser using mechanize and it does the same like reuqests. Thank You</p>
