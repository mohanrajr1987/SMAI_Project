<p>I need to send a request with <em>"Transfer-Encoding: chunked"</em> header set. When I <em>try to call xhr.setRequestHeader("transfer-encoding", "chunked")</em>, Chrome throws the following error in console: <em>"Refused to set unsafe header "content-length"</em>.</p>  <p>There is a lot of information about sending chunked responses. Is it possible to send chunked request to server? </p>
