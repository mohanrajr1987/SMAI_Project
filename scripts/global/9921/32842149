<p>So as the title suggests, this happened the 2nd time on our production server on nginx. It is just in few mins both times. But it is enough to ruin our business as our code depends heavily on $_REQUEST </p>  <p>I made an experiment of changing $_REQUEST to $_GET and $_POST :</p>  <pre><code>$_REQUEST['postId'] =&gt; $_GET ['postId']  </code></pre>  <p>and it works (during that downtime).</p>  <p>We used $_REQUEST almost everywhere, we won't use it in the future but...</p>  <p>Note: I have googled but what I found couldn't explain and just made me more confused</p>
