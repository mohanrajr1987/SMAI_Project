<p>The following website: <a href="http://www.mazegenerator.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mazegenerator.net/</a></p>  <p>If you click the "Generate maze" button, you'll see such request sent:</p>  <p><code>ImageGenerator.ashx?Tag=20151003103827&amp;ForcePNG=0&amp;MazeType=1&amp;Solution=0</code></p>  <p>I tried to debug and follow the click event, but I couldn't figure out what is this <code>Tag</code> parameter.</p>  <p>I want to be able to send request to this website, and get a maze image as a response.</p>  <p>This web states <a href="http://www.mazegenerator.net/About.aspx" rel="nofollow">here</a>: <code>You are free to use the mazes you generate here in any non-commercial way you want.</code></p>  <p>I'm doing it for learning so it's alright! thanks in advance!</p>
