<p>Hello I'm using the MEAN stack from meanjs.org just to give you an idea of a rough configuration.</p>  <p>I am trying to create a job board where people can post and apply for jobs. What I have done is create two different modules in Angular / Express, one to represent "Jobs" and one to represent "Applications".</p>  <p>I need to be able to invoke the create function in my application controller with jobId as a parameter when the "apply" button in my Job view page is clicked.</p>  <p>Here is what I have tried</p>  <pre><code>      .state('jobs.createApplication', {     url: '/create',     templateUrl: 'modules/applications/client/views/create-application.client.view.html',     data: {       roles: ['user', 'admin']     }   }); </code></pre>  <p>I have tried adding a state in the Job view which will route to the correct page but this doesn't seem to work unless I'm missing a step.</p>  <p>Doing this with a simple href and navigating to the right page with information as a GET would work but I'm assuming there is a better way of doing this with angular.</p>  <p>Thanks for your help.</p>
