<p>I have the following table setup: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/W4M5P.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/W4M5P.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Running the query in Mongoose as follows:</p>  <pre><code>leaguepositions.find({leagueID:leagueID}).populate('team_id').sort({position: 1}).execAsync(); </code></pre>  <p>I'd like to be able to return only the results from the highest value of <code>week</code>. Right now the highest is <code>2</code>, if that value was <code>100</code> then I'd like to ignore the other 99 weeks and only display the highest value?</p>
