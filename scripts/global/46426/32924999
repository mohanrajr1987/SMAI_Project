<p>I am currently implementing stripe into my Node.js api. I've noticed that stripe doesn't throw an error if a credit card is duplicated. I've also noticed that each credit card have a fingerprint attributes which allow me to manually check for duplicate.</p>  <p>But currently I have to add the card to my customer, check for a duplicate and then remove it if it is a duplicate.</p>  <p>I didn't found another way to do it with the node module. Am I missing something ?</p>
