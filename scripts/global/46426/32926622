<p>I'm having trouble getting centralized error handling set up in my restify app. I'd like to trap certain Mongo errors, such as "E11000 duplicate key error" and then map them to a restify ConflictError.</p>  <p>If I just let the error bubble up from my Mongo call in a route, the client gets a 500 error.</p>  <p>I figured I should trap InternalServerError, but the below handler never gets called:</p>  <pre><code>app.on('InternalServerError', function (req, res, err, cb) {     console.log('++++++++++++++++', err);     return cb(err); }); </code></pre>  <p>I thought I could just use the node approach:</p>  <pre><code>app.use(function (err, req, res, next){... </code></pre>  <p>But restify handlers don't seem to take an error argument.  I'm stumped after searching all the user places. It seems my first approach should have just worked.</p>
