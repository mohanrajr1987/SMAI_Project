<p>I'm trying to use typed.js and another jQuery plugin in tandem so that after typed.js runs its string, the user can input an answer using the editable plugin. I'd like to restrict that answer to either "yes(y) or no (n)", but that's a different issue. </p>  <p>Here's what I've got so far. I'm trying to use setTimeout in order to call the second function later. It's in Jade:</p>  <p><strong>script</strong></p>  <pre><code>  window.onload = $(function(){     $(".element").typed({        strings: ['Are you down with the movement(Y/N)?'],        typeSpeed: 150     });     setTimeout $(function({       $(function(){         $(".element").editableDiv();       )};     )};   )}; </code></pre>
