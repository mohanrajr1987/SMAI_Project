<p>I have a C++ linux app that uses typical linux IPC message queues as a control channel. I have another C++ app the provides a command line interface that allows me to connect to the main C++ app through linux IPC message queues and send control messages.</p>  <p>I now want to develop a web based control interface for this C++ app and want to use node.js for that web control app. But I do not want to have to redesign that control channel which is currently using linux IPC message queues.</p>  <p>Is there a node package that allows me to interface with the standard linux message queues? All of the node message queue packages appear to be self contained javascript message queues.</p>  <p>Thanks,</p>
