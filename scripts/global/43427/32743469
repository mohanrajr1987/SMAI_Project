<p>I have a Spider that scrapes data which can not be saved in one item class.</p>  <p>For illustration, I have one Profile Item, and each Profile Item might have an unknown number of Comments. That is why I want to implement Profile Item and Comment Item. I know I can pass them to my pipeline simply by using yield.</p>  <ol> <li><p>However, I do not know how a pipeline with one parse_item function can handle two different item classes?</p></li> <li><p>Or is it possible to use different parse_item functions?</p></li> <li><p>Or do I have to use several pipelines?</p></li> <li><p>Or is it possible to write an Iterator to a Scrapy Item Field?</p></li> </ol>  <hr>  <pre><code>comments_list=[] comments=response.xpath(somexpath) for x in comments.extract():         comments_list.append(x)     ScrapyItem['comments'] =comments_list </code></pre>
