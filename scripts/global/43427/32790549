<p>I'm trying to get both keys and values of attributes of some tag in a XML file (using scrapy and xpath).</p>  <p>The tag is something like:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;element attr1="value1" attr2="value2 ...&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I don't know the keys "attr1", "attr2" and so on, and they can change between two elements. I didn't figure out how to get both keys and values with xpath, is there any other good practice for doing that?</p>
