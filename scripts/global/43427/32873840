<p>I have a form in html page that has action to run php file. The php file has to run a bash function command which in turn runs a scrapy spider. Since I have the scrapy spider located outside var/www/, I have added a function in .bashrc to run the bash command ($ startscript) from anywhere. When I run it on the terminal from var/www folder or anywhere it works as expected but when I do it in php file it does not work. I am not sure if its because of php file permission, scrapy proprieties or something else.</p>  <p>Any suggestions?</p>  <p>.php file:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php $output = shell_exec('startscript'); echo $output; ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>.bashrc file:</p>  <pre><code>function startscript {    cd /home/pi/IndeedCoUkCrawl    ./BotScrapy.sh } </code></pre>
