<p>I am writing a crawlspider using Scrapy and I use a downloader middleware to rotate user agents for each request. What I would like to know if there is a way to temporize this. In other words, I would like to know if it is possible to tell the spider to change User Agent every X seconds. I thought that, maybe, using the DOWNLOAD_DELAY setting to do this would do the trick. </p>
