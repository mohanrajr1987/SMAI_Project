<p>When attempting to use scrapy to view or scrape <a href="http://www.kw.com/kw/agent/johndoucette" rel="nofollow">http://www.kw.com/kw/agent/johndoucette</a> (or most pages on that domain), I get back a blank page.  Viewing the page source returns a mess of hidden javascript, but that's about it.</p>  <p>I've tried many different user agents, proxies, no proxies, settings, etc. (e.g. <code>scrapy view http://www.kw.com/kw/agent/johndoucette -s USER_AGENT="Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_10_2) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/4302357130 Safari/537.36"</code> from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31189588/scrapy-view-returns-a-blank-page">here</a>)  It's not my settings - it's reproducible from the scrapy shell view(response) command on a new install.  I just don't know how to ignore that script.</p>  <p>Is there any way to get around this?</p>
