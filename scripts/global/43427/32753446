<p>I have a crawler running since a few days. I want to pause the crawler in order to do something else on the system. Scrapy documentation says, this can be done using telnet console but I am unable to login into telnet console. Here are the processes running in the system:</p>  <pre><code>[root@xxx tmp]# telnet localhost 6073 Trying 127.0.0.1... telnet: connect to address 127.0.0.1: Connection refused [root@xxx tmp]# ps aux | grep scrapy  root      5504  0.0  0.0 110400   860 pts/1    S+   04:31   0:00 grep scrapy root     31457  4.0  1.9 774880 299436 pts/1   Sl   Sep21 141:27 /usr/local/pyenv/bin/python2.7 /usr/local/pyenv/bin/scrapy crawl myCrawler  </code></pre>  <p>Any help is appreciated. Thanks.</p>
