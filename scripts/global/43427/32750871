<p>I try to scrap one page with scrapy. I found the xpath with FireXpath (a firefox plugin), and it seem good. But with Scrapy, I've got no result.</p>  <p>My python program look like this:</p>  <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python -tt # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-  from scrapy.selector import Selector from scrapy.contrib.spiders import CrawlSpider from datetime import datetime from scrapy.spider import BaseSpider  class robtex(BaseSpider):     # Crawling Start     CrawlSpider.started_on = datetime.now()     # CrawlSpider     name = 'robtex'      DOWNLOAD_DELAY = 3     start_urls = [ "https://www.whois.com/en/advisory/dns/com/stackoverflow/whois.html"]       def parse(self, response):         # Selector         sel = Selector(response)         print sel.xpath(".//*[@id='datawhois']/div[2]/table[3]/tbody/tr[3]/td[2]/a/text()").extract() </code></pre>  <p>How to fixe it ?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
