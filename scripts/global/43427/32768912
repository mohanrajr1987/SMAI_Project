<p>I'm using Selenium with Python to extract list of doctors from <a href="https://www.dukemedicine.org/find-doctors-physicians/" rel="nofollow">this</a> website. I select the option <strong>Specialty</strong> and extract the results. The results are displayed once we scroll the pages as in twitter feed. I'm unable to scroll the page to view the results. I tried multiple approaches like <strong>send_keys</strong> as:</p>  <pre><code>   for i in range(0,15):                 self.driver.find_element_by_id("doctor-matrix-section").send_keys(Keys.PAGE_DOWN)                 time.sleep(1)                 print 'hello'                 print i                 i+= 1 </code></pre>  <p>The loop is used as i've no idea how long i need to press the <strong>PAGE DOWN</strong> button.  I also tried another approach as:</p>  <pre><code>driver.execute_script("window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight);") </code></pre>  <p>None of the approach i followed worked. Any help would be really useful.</p>
