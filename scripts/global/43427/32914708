<p>I am trying to crawl a website using scrapy. But few urls on the website are of the form <a href="https://www.mainwebsite.com/sports/something/" rel="nofollow">https://www.mainwebsite.com/sports/something/</a></p>  <p>So when crawlers starts it combines the base url with this url like this <a href="https://www.mainwebsite.com/%0A%0A%0A/https://www.mainwebsite.com/sports/something/" rel="nofollow">https://www.mainwebsite.com/%0A%0A%0A/https://www.mainwebsite.com/sports/something/</a></p>  <p>Somebody faced similar problem? Do I need to override _extract_links method of LxmlParserLinkExtractor class of lxmlhtml.py class?</p>
