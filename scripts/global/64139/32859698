<p>I know how to throttle concurrent requests with ServiceBehavior, e.g.:</p>  <ul> <li>MaxConcurrentCalls</li> <li>MaxConcurrentSessions</li> <li>MaxConcurrentInstances</li> </ul>  <p>However, what I am trying to do on top of this is enforce a maximum frequency of requests, e.g. there should not be more than N calls per minute (calls over this frequency would have to sleep for a while).</p>  <p>I need to do this outside the service implementation, ideally in the initialisation of the service. There are too many services and too many methods to implement a catch method-by-method. Is there some kind of on-request-begin event I can subscribe to?</p>
