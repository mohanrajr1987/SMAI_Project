<p>I'm trying to get some help on deserializing a JSON reponse to a <code>DataSet</code>.</p>  <p>in theory this should be easy as using this example</p>  <p><a href="http://www.newtonsoft.com/json/help/html/DeserializeDataSet.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.newtonsoft.com/json/help/html/DeserializeDataSet.htm</a></p>  <pre><code>DataSet dataSet = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;DataSet&gt;(json); DataTable dataTable = dataSet.Tables["Table1"]; </code></pre>  <p>However the JSON I am getting back is supplemented / decorated using "odata.metadata"</p>  <p>see below.</p>  <pre><code>{"odata.metadata":"http://nodts004.cloudapp.net:7058/TNPMaster2016Dev/OData/$metadata#NP_Customer","value":[{"No":"01121212","Name":"Spotsmeyer's Furnishings","City":"Miami","Amount":"0","Customer_Posting_Group":"FOREIGN","Balance_LCY":"0","Sales_LCY":"0","Profit_LCY":"0","Balance_Due_LCY":"0","Payments_LCY":"0","Inv_Amounts_LCY":"0","Cr_Memo_Amounts_LCY":"0","Outstanding_Orders":"0","Shipped_Not_Invoiced":"0","No_of_Quotes":0,"No_of_Blanket_Orders":0,"No_of_Orders":6,"No_of_Invoices":0,"No_of_Return_Orders":0,"No_of_Credit_Memos":0,"No_of_Pstd_Shipments":0,"No_of_Pstd_Invoices":0,"No_of_Pstd_Return_Receipts":0,"No_of_Pstd_Credit_Memos":0,"No_of_Ship_to_Addresses":0,"Outstanding_Orders_LCY":"0","Shipped_Not_Invoiced_LCY":"0"},{"No":"01445544","Name":"Progressive Home Furnishings","City":"Chicago","Amount":"0","Customer_Posting_Group":"FOREIGN","Balance_LCY":"1499.02","Sales_LCY":"1499.02","Profit_LCY":"305.12","Balance_Due_LCY":"1499.02","Payments_LCY":"0","Inv_Amounts_LCY":"1499.02","Cr_Memo_Amounts_LCY":"0","Outstanding_Orders":"0","Shipped_Not_Invoiced":"0","No_of_Quotes":0,"No_of_Blanket_Orders":0,"No_of_Orders":0,"No_of_Invoices":0,"No_of_Return_Orders":0,"No_of_Credit_Memos":0,"No_of_Pstd_Shipments":1,"No_of_Pstd_Invoices":1,"No_of_Pstd_Return_Receipts":0,"No_of_Pstd_Credit_Memos":0,"No_of_Ship_to_Addresses":0,"Outstanding_Orders_LCY":"0","Shipped_Not_Invoiced_LCY":"0"},{"No":"01454545","Name":"New Concepts Furniture","City":"Atlanta","Amount":"0","Customer_Posting_Group":"FOREIGN","Balance_LCY":"222241.32","Sales_LCY":"0","Profit_LCY":"0","Balance_Due_LCY":"222241.32","Payments_LCY":"0","Inv_Amounts_LCY":"222241.32","Cr_Memo_Amounts_LCY":"0","Outstanding_Orders":"15609","Shipped_Not_Invoiced":"0","No_of_Quotes":0,"No_of_Blanket_Orders":0,"No_of_Orders":1,"No_of_Invoices":0,"No_of_Return_Orders":0,"No_of_Credit_Memos":0,"No_of_Pstd_Shipments":0,"No_of_Pstd_Invoices":0,"No_of_Pstd_Return_Receipts":0,"No_of_Pstd_Credit_Memos":0,"No_of_Ship_to_Addresses":0,"Outstanding_Orders_LCY":"8702.82","Shipped_Not_Invoiced_LCY":"0"},{"No":"01905893","Name":"Candoxy Canada Inc.","City":"Thunder Bay","Amount":"0","Customer_Posting_Group":"FOREIGN","Balance_LCY":"0","Sales_LCY":"0","Profit_LCY":"0","Balance_Due_LCY":"0","Payments_LCY":"0","Inv_Amounts_LCY":"0","Cr_Memo_Amounts_LCY":"0","Outstanding_Orders":"0","Shipped_Not_Invoiced":"0","No_of_Quotes":0,"No_of_Blanket_Orders":0,"No_of_Orders":0,"No_of_Invoices":0,"No_of_Return_Orders":0,"No_of_Credit_Memos":0,"No_of_Pstd_Shipments":0,"No_of_Pstd_Invoices":0,"No_of_Pstd_Return_Receipts":0,"No_of_Pstd_Credit_Memos":0,"No_of_Ship_to_Addresses":0,"Outstanding_Orders_LCY":"0","Shipped_Not_Invoiced_LCY":"0"},{"No":"01905899","Name":"Elkhorn Airport","City":"Elkhorn","Amount":"0","Customer_Posting_Group":"FOREIGN","Balance_LCY":"0","Sales_LCY":"0","Profit_LCY":"0","Balance_Due_LCY":"0","Payments_LCY":"0","Inv_Amounts_LCY":"0","Cr_Memo_Amounts_LCY":"0","Outstanding_Orders":"0","Shipped_Not_Invoiced":"0","No_of_Quotes":0,"No_of_Blanket_Orders":0,"No_of_Orders":0,"No_of_Invoices":0,"No_of_Return_Orders":0,"No_of_Credit_Memos":0,"No_of_Pstd_Shipments":0,"No_of_Pstd_Invoices":0,"No_of_Pstd_Return_Receipts":0,"No_of_Pstd_Credit_Memos":0,"No_of_Ship_to_Addresses":0,"Outstanding_Orders_LCY":"0","Shipped_Not_Invoiced_LCY":"0"}]} </code></pre>  <p>I have for certain scenarios created a POCO to deal with the returned json for the properties</p>  <pre><code>public class RootObject2 {     [JsonProperty("odata.metadata")]     public string odatametadata { get; set; }      [JsonProperty("odata.nextLink")]     public string NextLinkUrl { get; set; } } </code></pre>  <p>and</p>  <pre><code>public class RootObject {     [JsonProperty("odata.metadata")]     public string odatametadata { get; set; }      [JsonProperty("odata.nextLink")]     public string NextLinkUrl { get; set; }      public List&lt;UrlItem&gt; Value { get; set; } } </code></pre>  <p>These are used in instances where I know the returned JSON will contain certain structures and can be safely dealt with.</p>  <p>The problem is that the <code>VALUE</code> part of the JSON will be dynamic in many instances and I wanted to take advantage of the dynamic nature of the <code>JSONConvert</code> functions to build <code>DataSet</code>s that I can then pass through as a source for an Excel table. It should be noted that the data coming back will never be definable.</p>  <p>When i use the code:</p>  <pre><code>DataSet dataSet = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;DataSet&gt;(json); </code></pre>  <p>I get an error, because I need to be passing the sting / contents of the <code>VALUE</code> node/element to the <code>DeserialseObject</code>.</p>  <p>Is there a setting on the JSON converter that allows this?</p>  <p>I have tried to create a POCO with a <code>string</code> field and then after mapping the <code>VALUE</code> node to the POCO passing the string to the <code>JSONConverter</code> but this errors out.</p>  <p>A solution to this would be most helpful.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>  <p>B....</p>
