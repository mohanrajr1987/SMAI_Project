<p>I want to download multiple files from FTP to local. I download single file, which works, but for multiple files, I am not able to make it work. Please help me. </p>  <p>Here is my code for single file download:</p>  <pre><code> string path = Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.Desktop);     if (DownloadFile("ftp://ipaddress/Responses/",fileName, "username", "password", path))     {         MessageBox.Show("Files Downloaded...");         DeleteFiles(fileName);      } </code></pre>
