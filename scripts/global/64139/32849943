<p>I have been searching ðŸ”Ž on this subject and note that no one has really answered this, thus I am asking the question here.</p>  <p>I have a restful method that returns a pdf as a bytes, which in the http response I save to Stream. This Stream I point to my Web browser control using the document stream property and call the doevents method. </p>  <p>Unfortunately, this returns rubbish. Is it possible to have the browser control to render a pdf file by sending a stream?</p>
