<p>I'm fairly new to C# at least when it comes to things like this, so I apologize for the little amount of code I have.</p>  <p>I have a class that called Project.cs that needs to be used to hold data objects that I get from a 3rd party API.</p>  <p>Here is the class:</p>  <p>//Project.cs</p>  <pre><code>public sealed class Project {     public String Id { get; set; }     public String Title { get; set; }     public String Url { get; set; } } </code></pre>  <p>The method that you see below, is supposed to get the data(JSON) from the 3rd party API.</p>  <p>This API returns a list of projects in JSON form.</p>  <p>Fortunately I only need to pick a few attributes from the API (Id, Title, and URL).</p>  <p>Unfortunately, I have no idea how to get pick those specific attributes from the JSON and turn them into a collection of type Project.</p>  <p>Here is what I have so far.  I know it's sparse.</p>  <p>//ProjectSearch.cs</p>  <pre><code>public IEnumerable&lt;Project&gt; GetProjects(String catId) {     //Get the data from the API     WebRequest request = WebRequest.Create("http://research.a.edu/api/Catalogs('123')");     request.ContentType = "application/json; charset=utf-8";     WebResponse response = request.GetResponse();      //put each object found in the API into a Project object             var project = new Project();  } </code></pre>  <p>So, now, I'm stuck.  I don't know how to get all the objects from the API and put them into a collection of type Project.  Do I need a loop? Or is there another type of way of doing?</p>  <p>Sample JSON from API:</p>  <pre><code>{"odata.metadata":"http://research.a.edu/api/Catalogs/ $metadata#Catalogs /@Element", "odata.id":"http://research.a.edu/api/Catalogs ('123')", "Id":"12345", "ParentID":"xxxx","Name":"Test1","Created":"1/1/2015","Modified":"2/1/2015","Deleted","0","URL":"http://yoursite/1", ('123')", "Id":"7897", "ParentID":"xxxx","Name":"Test2","Created":"4/1/2015","Modified":"7/1/2015","Deleted","1","URL":"http://yoursite/2", ('123')", "Id":"65335", "ParentID":"xxxx","Name":"Test3","Created":"7/1/2015","Modified":"9/1/2015","Deleted","0","URL":"http://yoursite/3" } </code></pre>  <p>I'm lost.</p>  <p>If anyone could clue me in, I'd be grateful.</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
