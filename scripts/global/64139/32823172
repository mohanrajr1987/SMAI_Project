<p>I am Adding SSL certificate dynamically for every website host, and SSL cetificate get added for that particular site. But, the SSL doesn't work..I have to manually delete the Certificate then import the certifcate to make the SSL working.</p>  <p>My question is why after adding SSL dynamically via C# code, SSL gets added but does not work.?? Why i have to delete and import .pxf file manually to make it work? Do i need to add something in my code??</p>  <p>Code is as Follows:</p>  <pre><code>ServerManager serverMgr = new ServerManager();  X509Store store = new X509Store(StoreName.My, StoreLocation.LocalMachine);             store.Open(OpenFlags.OpenExistingOnly | OpenFlags.ReadWrite);               X509Certificate2 certificate = new X509Certificate2(@"C:\inetpub\wwwroot\Star_clouddunk_net.pfx", "w0rk");              store.Add(certificate);              var binding = mySite.Bindings.Add("*:443:" + strhostname + "", certificate.GetCertHash(), store.Name);             binding.Protocol = "https";             store.Close();              serverMgr.CommitChanges(); </code></pre>
