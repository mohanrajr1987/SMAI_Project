<p>I am using C# to to process some data from a notepead which after the processing will be written to a .csv file. I have done that but the problem is that in one column of the .csv file, some words have to appear two or three lines(equivalent to using Alt+Enter in excel column). I did it using Environment.NewLine, \r and \n as well. But I could not pull it off. Is there a way or is it simply not possible? Thanks in advance. Unnikrishnan, India.</p>
