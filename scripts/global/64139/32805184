<p>I'm using the last version of selenium in my C# console application.</p>  <p>The problem is I have a web site that I can't see the first element to login BUT the same website works fine in firefox</p>  <p>Things I tried:</p>  <ul> <li>Maximize the window: <code>driver.Manage().Window.Maximize();</code></li> <li>Checked if the element presented in other frame (No frames in this page).</li> <li>Wait till the element will show up / page load.</li> </ul>  <p><strong>One more thing:</strong></p>  <p>In this website when I check physically on site (view source) the html didn't have the element presentation like it should be, when I check the inspect element I see the html page like it should.</p>  <p>So what do I need to do is that phantomJS will take the html information from the DOM and not like the original page source from the server</p>  <p>How can I solve this problem?</p>  <p>When i using the Internet Explorer Driver its crashed on start (only on this specific website).</p>  <p>How can i solve that problem ?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
