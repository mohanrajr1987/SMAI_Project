<p>In the main window I have a central widget which has a natural size, and I would like to initialize it to this size. However, I do not want it to be fixed to this size; the user should be able to shrink or expand it.</p>  <p>The <a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qwidget.html#size-hints-and-size-policies" rel="nofollow">Qt documentation</a> states that:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Note: The size of top-level widgets are constrained to 2/3 of the   desktop's height and width. You can resize() the widget manually if   these bounds are inadequate.</p> </blockquote>  <p>But I am unable to use the <code>resize</code> method as prescribed.</p>  <p>The following minimal example illustrates the problem: If width and height as given by <code>w</code> and <code>h</code> is less than 2/3 of that of the screen, then the window gets the expected size. If they are greater, the window gets some truncated size.</p>  <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python from PyQt4 import QtCore, QtGui import sys w = 1280; h = 720 app = QtGui.QApplication (sys.argv [1:]) frm = QtGui.QFrame () frm.sizeHint = lambda: QtCore.QSize (w, h) win = QtGui.QMainWindow () win.setCentralWidget (frm) win.show () sys.exit (app.exec_ ()) </code></pre>
