<p>I am new to Qt. I am a hardware guy. I wanted to use Qt for displaying the benchmark results of a code (execution time) for a demo. I thought it would be more presentable if I displayed it in a visually appealing manner.</p>  <p>I came across a example implementation of a Speed gauge in Qt at this link: <a href="https://github.com/Berrima/Qt-custom-gauge-widget/tree/master/examples/SpeedGauge" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/Berrima/Qt-custom-gauge-widget/tree/master/examples/SpeedGauge</a></p>  <p>I want to display a number (say 900) on the speed gauge and this can be done by setting a value of the needle. But I want the needle to gradually increase and stop at 900.</p>  <p>Can someone please give me some idea how to proceed on this as I am very new to this and I have limited time.</p>  <p>Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.</p>
