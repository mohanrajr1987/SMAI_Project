<p>How can a QSortFilterProxyModel be used in order to filter a row but NOT its children nodes?</p>  <p>Let's say I want to filter all row whose first column text is "Mammal" but not the children rows (e.g. "Moose", "Cat", etc.) </p>  <p>If in the example the model contains:</p>  <pre><code>Animals     Mammals         Moose         Dog         Cat         Mouse </code></pre>  <p>and when the filter is applied the view would look like this:</p>  <pre><code>Animals     Moose     Dog     Cat     Mouse </code></pre>  <p>Can this be done using a QSortFilterProxyModel ? if not, I'm of course open to suggestions. But it would be nice to do it from the proxy I'm already using for other tasks.</p>
