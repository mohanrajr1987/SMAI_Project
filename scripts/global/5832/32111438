<p>I have a question about resizing an icon on a QPushButton. Target system is Qt 4.8.6 on Linux. I am using QPushButton to create buttons with icons only, no text. I would like to have the icon as large as possible centered on the button including some margin. </p>  <p>I do not want the button size to adapt to the image size, I want the image size to adapt to the button size, while the button size adapts automaticly to the GUI size through QGridLayout or manually resizing.</p>  <p>When simply creating the button, the icon is only loaded small within the middle:</p>  <pre><code>const QString fileName = "Bitmaps/btn.png"; if( !QFile( fileName ).exists() ) {     qDebug() &lt;&lt; "File not found: " &lt;&lt; fileName; } const QPixmap pixmap = QPixmap( fileName ); m_btn = new QPushButton( QIcon( pixmap ), "", this ); </code></pre>  <p>When resizing through manual setting, the icon does not scale:</p>  <pre><code>m_btn-&gt;setGeometry( QRect( 100, 100, 50, 50 ) ); </code></pre>  <p>To get the icon size rescaled I need to manually call setIconSize(). I can call this within the resize event of the instanciating widget. But handling the margin still has to be calculated manually.</p>  <pre><code>m_btn-&gt;setIconSize( QSize(  ( m_btn-&gt;size().width() - 12 ),                             ( m_btn-&gt;size().height() - 12 ) ) ); </code></pre>  <p>But, as I get from the Qt Documentation there is a Stylesheet based layout thing called "The Box Model" which is applied to QPushButton as well.</p>  <p><a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/stylesheet-customizing.html#box-model" rel="nofollow">http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/stylesheet-customizing.html#box-model</a></p>  <p>So my question is, how do I configure the push button icon to fill the "content" area (marked as grey in the above document). Possibly how do I configure it, that the icon resizes automaticly? Your help is appreciated :-)</p>
