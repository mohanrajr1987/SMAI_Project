<p>I coded an app using Qt5 (5.3.2), then installed Qt4 (4.8.2) in the same machine (Win 7). Compiler is MinGW-4.8.2 in both cases. Source code files are in UTF-8.</p>  <p>Using QtCreator to build both, I got an issue related to encoding in the app Graphical User Interface of the Qt4 side. Exemplifying:</p>  <p>Qt5: "Configurações"</p>  <p>Qt4: "ConfiguraÃ§Ães"</p>  <p>Could someone please give a hint?</p>
