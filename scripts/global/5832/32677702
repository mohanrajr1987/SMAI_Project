<p>I have been looking for ways to render a 3d scene using Qt QML controls. I saw there is a framebuffer example which uses <code>Canvas3D</code> control to get OpenGL 3d scene rendered. However this example uses JavaScript for the rendering logic.</p>  <p>I was looking for a way to do the same but via a C++ class. Is there any way to do so? Or any example available?</p>  <p>Ideally, I would like to use 3rd party renderer to create a scene. Any ideas?</p>
