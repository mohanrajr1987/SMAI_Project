<pre><code>for(int i =0; i &lt;shapes.size(); i++) // shapes is QList&lt;QWidget*&gt; of QShape {     shapes.at(i)-&gt;setShape(QShape::ellipse);     QGraphicsProxyWidget* proxyWid = graphscene-&gt;addWidget(shapes.at(i)); } view-&gt;setScene(graphscene);// view is a QGraphicsView object. </code></pre>  <p>I have the above code that i am using to place a number  of Qshapes on a Graphics view scene. looking a qt4.8 ressource i found that a QGraphicsProxyWidget need to be created to bridge the scene element with the different QWidget. the code works, but i have a concern wether the implementation is correct, is the proxywid pointer correctly allocated? is it safe to use a pointer this way? i am trying to avoid any memory problem.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance for assisting me</p>
