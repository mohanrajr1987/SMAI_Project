<p>I'm working on a QML application that has a lot of property bindings: hundreds of objects are tracked and displayed in different forms like Qt3D/QCanvas.</p>  <p>When I'm on a separate page of the application those property bindings for x/y locations and relative sizes are still happening. How can I stop them? I know I could bind the properties based on whether they're visual or not but that is a lot of unnecessary code:</p>  <p>x: visible ? tracking.location(index).x : 0</p>  <p>I would have to wrap a ton of bindings like that. Any other solutions?</p>
