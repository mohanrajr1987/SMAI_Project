<p>I am using the following code in order to generate <code>QPixmap*</code> pointers and then insert them into <code>QHash&lt;QString, QPixmap*&gt;</code> (I will show only the pointers generation code since this is the one that fails).</p>  <pre><code>QPixmap* MyClass::loadImg(QString fileName) {     QImage qimage(fileName);     if (qimage.isNull()) {        qDebug() &lt;&lt; "Cannot load image " &lt;&lt;  fileName;     }      QPixmap *image = new QPixmap(fileName);     return image; } </code></pre>  <p>The problem that I have is the following: For the first about 200 calls the method works fine - it is being called on a loop that iterates through the image files of a directory. Then suddenly the <code>QPixmap*</code> starts returning <code>QPixmap(null)</code> for no apparent reason.<code>QImage</code> is also null when that happens. I have checked and made sure that the path is fine. Also, I have tried with various sets of images and the same always happens - it runs with no problems the ~200 calls and then starts generating nulls.</p>  <p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
