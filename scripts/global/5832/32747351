<p>I would like QMAKE_CLEAN to empty/delete a data directory in my build directory. I already have it clear out all of the DLLs from the build directory like so:</p>  <pre><code>win32: {     Debug: {         QMAKE_CLEAN += $$slasher("$${OUT_PWD}/debug/*.dll")     } else {         QMAKE_CLEAN += $$slasher("$${OUT_PWD}/release/*.dll")     } } </code></pre>  <p>and that works just fine.</p>  <p>However, when I try to delete the entire contents of a directory like so:</p>  <pre><code>QMAKE_CLEAN += $$slasher("Q:/stuff/*.*") </code></pre>  <p>It fails to work. I looked in the Compile Output window and saw this text:</p>  <pre><code>Q:\stuff\*.*, Are you sure (Y/N)?  </code></pre>  <p>Why does this prompt show up and how can I get past it?</p>  <p>PS - The `slasher' function is just a convenience function to turn forward slashes to backslashes on a Windows machine.</p>
