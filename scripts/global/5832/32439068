<p>I'm quite new with python and I currently have 2 issues with my code:</p>  <ul> <li>when running the GUI I have to press a button twice, before it prints to the console (the button is currently supposed to do nothing but print a message to the console).</li> <li>I have regular issues with the kernel crashing. I haven't really observed any pattern, if I run the program several times in a row it usually works fine. The after some time the kernel dies and I have ro restart... quite annoying.</li> </ul>  <p>Here is my code:</p>  <pre><code>import sys from PyQt4 import QtGui, QtCore, uic   class MainWindow(QtGui.QMainWindow):     def __init__(self, parent = None):         super(MainWindow, self).__init__(parent)          self.ui = uic.loadUi('C:/Users/ried_st/Documents/Programming/Python/GUI_run_MODTRAN/Run_MODTRAN.ui', self)         self.ui.show()          self.connect(self.ui.pushButton_run, QtCore.SIGNAL('clicked()'), buttonFn)         self.connect(self.ui.comboBox_model, QtCore.SIGNAL("currentIndexChanged(QString)"), comboFn)   def buttonFn():     print ('MODTRAN is supposed to be started')  def comboFn(value):     print (window.ui.comboBox_model.currentText())       if ( __name__ == '__main__' ):     app = None     if ( not app ):         app = QtGui.QApplication(sys.argv)      window = MainWindow()     window.show()      if ( app ):         app.exec_() </code></pre>
