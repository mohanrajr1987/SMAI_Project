<p>Let's say some images have to be generated by a Qt console program and that <strong>font metrics</strong> are needed by internal algorithms (they use the <strong>text width/height</strong> as input to compute the position where the drawing should occur). This program has to be runable on a Linux without any GUI (runlevel-3, basically a cluster without any display server).</p>  <p><strong>Problem:</strong> QFontMetrics are only available when running a Qt application in GUI mode.<br> Any workaround to get string metrics without any display server ? </p>
