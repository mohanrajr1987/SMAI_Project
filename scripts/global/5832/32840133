<p>I have a <code>QGraphicsScene</code> with some line <code>QGraphicsLineItem</code> drawn on it, all select-able and drag-able. When I click on one, it gets selected. After selecting one, if I left click outside any drawn items, the selection goes away, which is expected. </p>  <p>If after selecting an item, I do Ctrl+Left-Click in the open scene(that is not on any drawn item), the selected items gets de-selected. Can I override this behavior somehow and make sure that on doing Ctrl+Click, selected items do not get de-selected? </p>
