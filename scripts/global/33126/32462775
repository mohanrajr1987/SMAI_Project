<p>I'm currently creating a c# .net class to replace all of the connection strings we use for our various environments. I'm doing this by adding the environment specific connection string to the machine config file for the .net versions we are using and the class simply reads the connection string from those settings.</p>  <p>My class works fine and everything at this point appears to be in working order. There is one small issue I have not been able to solve with this setup. When using the built in Microsoft tool to build Linq 2 SQL classes (everyone seems to refer to this tool as "the designer"), I don't have an option to specify the connection string in the machine config file. I essentially have to enter all of the credentials again (and the tool auto generates a new connection string in my web.config file).</p>  <p>Clearly not the end of the world but it would help us improve our workflow if we didn't have to keep entering all of this data over and over again for every new project. So does anyone know how get these connection strings to show up in server explorer or if there is another work around I can use for this?</p>  <p>I've currently been using VS 2015 Professional but I also have access to (and most of my team uses) VS 2012 Professional</p>
