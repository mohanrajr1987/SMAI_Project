<p>I have a seemingly odd issue here. I'm new to Linq-to-SQL, so I might be missing something obvious. </p>  <p>I have a DataContext dbml representing the tables in my database, and one of these tables represents a log table which accumulates a lot of records. Simply adding this table to the dbml appears to populate every record from the database into the DataContext object (and therefore my viewmodel, since the datacontext is a member of the viewmodel). </p>  <p>I never noticed this until I serialized the viewmodel into XML and noticed the file size was rather large for the data contained in the viewmodel. </p>  <p>Opening up the XML revealed every single log record from this table was present, despite not being referenced anywhere except the initialization of the Linq-to-SQL datacontext object (table is not referenced). </p>  <p>I haven't yet checked if other tables are doing the same thing (other tables are very small since this project and database is still new), but the log table stood out as 80% of the size of the serialized file. </p>  <p>This is also worrying, since it is being queried and stored in memory, costing me additional performance. This will be a big problem once the software is in use and the database grows at a large rate. </p>  <p>Any ideas on to how to prevent Linq-to-SQL from pulling in every record? Thanks.</p>
