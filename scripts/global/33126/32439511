<p>i have a project in progress that i'm not sure if to use entity framework or linq-to-sql, and i'm seeking for more info to decide.</p>  <p>currently I've started implementing using EF6 but as I've read that EF6 is much slower than linq-to-sql from dapper <a href="https://github.com/StackExchange/dapper-dot-net#performance-of-select-mapping-over-500-iterations---poco-serialization" rel="nofollow">readme</a> so i want to migrate to the alternative before it's too late in my project</p>  <p>my questions are:</p>  <ul> <li><p>how do i create indexes in my linq-to-sql Models (using attribute or migrations)?</p></li> <li><p>how do i define string length?</p></li> <li>do i have to define the Storage value in the Column Attribute?</li> </ul>
