<p>I am new to SQL server and trying to make a very simple website which will record  usernames and passwords from clients into a database. I have created a database project with a table of users: <em>user name</em> and <em>password</em>. I built a website with a page containing <code>user name</code> text field, <code>password</code> text field and a <code>login</code> button. All I want is to record the usernames and passwords the users are entering (as simple as that). I want to do it via sql connection using LINQ-to-SQL. I know that I have to create SQLConnection class, create a dbml file and attach my database to it. I am having trouble creating a dbml file of my database and attaching my database to it in Visual Studio 2013. Can anyone please give direction to do so?</p>  <p>So far I have this class for the login page:</p>  <pre><code>public partial class Login : System.Web.UI.Page {     protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)     {      }     protected void Button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)     {         string connStr = "data source=.; database = AuroraDB; integrated security=SSPI";         SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["TODO"].ConnectionString);          try         {              string insertQuery = "insert into Users (Username, Password,) values(@uname , @password)";         SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand(insertQuery, connection);         command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@uname", UserNameTextBox.Text);         command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@password", PasswordTextBox.Text);         connection.Open();         command.ExecuteNonQuery();         Response.Write("Loggin was successful!");          }         catch(Exception exception)         {             Response.Write("Error occurred: " + exception.Message);         }         finally         {             connection.Close();          }     } } </code></pre>
