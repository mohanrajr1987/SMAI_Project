<p>Here I have a lambda expression which selects the best joke by the highest rating.</p>  <p>So the relationship looks like this: 1 joke has many ratings.</p>  <p>The lambda query for selecting the best joke is as follows.</p>  <pre><code>Joke best = jokes.GroupJoin(context.Ratings,  // DBContext                             j =&gt; j.ID,                             r =&gt; r.JokeID,                             (j, r) =&gt; new {                                            bestJoke = j,                                            sum = r.Sum(s =&gt; s.Rating1)                                           })                  .OrderByDescending(j =&gt; j.sum)                  .First().bestJoke; </code></pre>  <p>I struggling to write this into linq query.</p>  <p>I tried so far.</p>  <pre><code>    Joke best2 = from j in jokes                  join r in context.Ratings on j.ID equals r.JokeID                  group j by j into g                  select new {                       bestJoke = j,                       } ... </code></pre>  <p>Could anyone please help me out? Thank you very much.</p>
