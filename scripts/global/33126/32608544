<p>I have a Db table with a csv field called "Line". There are several values in the field separated by semicolons.</p>  <p>I am trying to find a LINQ expression to check if there is any row where the second value in the "Line" field has a specific value.</p>  <p>Something like:</p>  <pre><code>if (dbContext.Test.Any(t =&gt; Array.IndexOf(t.Line.Split(';'), value) = 1)) { Do something ...                           } </code></pre>  <p>Example:</p>  <pre><code>Line = "value1;apple;value3;value4" if (dbContext.Test.Any("second value in Line field equals 'apple'")) { Do something ... } </code></pre>  <p>What's the most straight-forward and concise way to do this?</p>
