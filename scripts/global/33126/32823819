A database relationship does exist between the two tables, and table Employee have an Identity column as the Primary Key.</p>  <p>I'm trying:</p>  <pre><code>        Database.Employee emp = new Database.Employee()         {             x = DateTime.Now,             y = "xxx"         };         Database.Skill skill = new Database.Skill()         {             Skill = "Reading"         };         emp.Skills = skill;  //Error on this line         dc.Employees.InsertOnSubmit(emp);         dc.SubmitChanges(); </code></pre>  <p>But I get the error that:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Cannot implicitly convert type 'Database.Skill' to   'System.Data.Linq.EntitySet'</p> </blockquote>
