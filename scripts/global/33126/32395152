<p>I have this C# L2S code:</p>  <pre><code>Table&lt;ERPRaw&gt; linqRawFile = db.GetTable&lt;RawFile&gt;(); var linqNameList =     from row in linqRawFile.AsEnumerable()     select row.fileName; currentFileNameList = linqNameList.ToArray(); </code></pre>  <p>It's supposed to read only the fileName field, but when I check in the SQL server profiler, I see that this query triggers full record loading. The fields contain file binary data, so the full table loading takes considerable time. Retrieving just the fileName field takes only few milliseconds.</p>  <p>What would be the right way to retrieve only fileName field of RawFile in as an array of strings? I assume that the linq framework now loads each RawFile record in full, as it doesn't see I will retrieve only the fileName property from the list.</p>  <p>Perhaps I have to construct the query without referencing the linqRawFile at all? Wouldn't that be kind of ignoring the reason linq is introduced in the project, to abstract the database layer away?</p>
