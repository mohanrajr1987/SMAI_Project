<p>I am guessing this is a JOIN issue - which I don't understand anyway. but I have to get a Record from EUReporteds if the Where clause is correct and if the Where clause on another table is NOT correct. </p>  <p>The coding I am using is truly horrific</p>  <pre><code>do   {   // Get the next Unprocessed.   if (skip == 0)      eur = de.EUReporteds.Where(r =&gt; r.Processed == false &amp;&amp; r.ReportProcessingCount &lt; 11).FirstOrDefault();   else      eur = de.EUReporteds.Where(r =&gt; r.Processed == false &amp;&amp; r.ReportProcessingCount &lt; 11).OrderBy(ob =&gt; ob.id).Skip(skip).FirstOrDefault();      // Have we personally already done this?      pr = de.ProcessingResults.Where(p =&gt; p.UserId == CurrentUser.UserId &amp;&amp; p.id == eur.id).FirstOrDefault();               skip++; } while (pr != null || eur == null); // If so repeat </code></pre>  <p>So what I am trying to do here is:</p>  <ol> <li>Get a record from EUReporteds WHERE the record has not been processed AND WHERE the RecordProcessingCount is less than 11</li> <li>Check to see if this logged in user has already processed that record by Getting The ProcessingResults Record where The CurrentUser exists AND WHERE the ID of EUReporteds also exists</li> <li>IF ProcessingResults Record Exists then we have done this record find the next until The ProcessingResults record can not be found.</li> </ol>  <p>Could someone please show me how to write this properly please.</p>
