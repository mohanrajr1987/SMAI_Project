<p>I have used Automapper for a long time without any difficulty for a long time and I have been trying to integrate this wonderful tool into my LINQ to SQl framework recently. I have following code:</p>  <pre><code>using (var ps = new Promotionalsponsorship(constr)) {    var applicationToSave = Mapper.Map&lt;ApplicationModel, Application&gt;(application);          if (applicationToSave.ApplicationId == default(int))     {         ps.Application.InsertOnSubmit(applicationToSave);     }                      ps.Application.Context.SubmitChanges();  }  </code></pre>  <p>What I am trying to do here is UPSERT method where I am saying that if there is anew record with id = 0 then insert OR update. Funny thing here is that insert works BUT <strong>ps.Application.Context.SubmitChanges();</strong> does not work when I update the context using Automapper as I did that in the code above.</p>  <p>Now, if I update context using simple property assignment like following:</p>  <pre><code>applicationToSave.Name = "Beautiful"; if (applicationToSave.ApplicationId == default(int)) {     ps.Application.InsertOnSubmit(applicationToSave); } ps.Application.Context.SubmitChanges();  </code></pre>  <p>This one works. I feel like Automapper does something to context object which makes it detached from the DB. I am not sure. How can I make it work with AutoMapper?</p>
