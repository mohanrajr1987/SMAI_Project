<p>I am implementing a forum where each post can have comments.</p>  <p>I want to load a batch of N posts so each post loads the first K comments. </p>  <p>I've got this code to start with, but it currently includes <strong>all</strong> the comments with each post. <strong>How do I only load first K comments with each post</strong> without having to make K calls to the database?</p>  <pre><code>List&lt;ForumPost&gt; result = ctx                             .ForumPosts                             .Include("Comments") // &lt;-- ??? How to take first K ???                             .Where(i =&gt; i.Thread.ID == threadID)                             .OrderByDescending(i =&gt; i.Date)                             .Take(N).ToList(); </code></pre>  <p>Thanks!</p>
