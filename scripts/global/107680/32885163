<p>I'm wanting to know if its possible for me to setup a server pc, the idea is to have two network ports. one port will connect to a switcher to the internet and one to a switcher that only connects to the cameras. The idea being that the cameras will not connect to the outside internet directly but have to go through the software to then be released onto the internet.</p>  <p>My question is how do i do it and is there anyone that can spec out a machine in a 4u server case that would be capable of it</p>  <p>The OS has got to be windows.</p>  <p>Thanks Dan</p>
