<p>So lets say I have a byte array <code>byte[] bytes</code> which is initialised with some data(Client side).</p>  <p>The contents of the byte array can be of type <code>A</code> or <code>B</code>.</p>  <p>Then I want to sent the array over to my server. And I want the server to be able to identify which of the two types of data the array contains (<code>A</code> or <code>B</code>)</p>  <p>I thought about adding one more byte (as it is going to be only a couple of types. maybe 3) as a prefix to the beginning of the array so that the server can identify the type, then remove the first byte and read the contents.</p>  <p>Is there a reason why I shouldn't do that? Is there another approach better than that?</p>  <p>P.S. I don't want to send another message prior to my array to inform about the type of the next message</p>
