<p>I am trying to test my XmlRpc server locally (without the use of a client), but I am unaware of how to send the calls to the server while it is running. Can anyone fill me in on how to do this? The mapping is </p>  <pre><code>mazeserver=server.MazeHandler </code></pre>  <p>and I have tried sending things like:</p>  <pre><code>mazeserver.connect("string", string") </code></pre>  <p>with no result.</p>
