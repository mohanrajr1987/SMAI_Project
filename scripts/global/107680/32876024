<p>When I append a random page name in my website's domain, The server returns: error 503 internal server error. Which is not the case. Because the requested page doesn't exist at all. For example: When I type: Www.mysite.Com/foobar.php The server fires a 503 internal server error. Even though the foobar page doesn't Exist!! Meanwhile, when I type foobar.html it gives 404 page not found error which is correct. So how can I fix this?  Thanks in advance. Edit:<br> My problem is whenever I request a random page name from my website, it gives 503 error. which is wrong  I want to make it so that when I request a none existing page, it gives error 404, not 503.</p>
