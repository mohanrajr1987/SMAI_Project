<p>I would like to create an app that talks to the user's computer so I'd like to create a 'server' with a REST API. What is the best way to go about doing this? I looked into WCF but that seems overkill and most tutorials I see seems it's more suitable to a server backend than being installed on a user computer. </p>  <p>Are there other more suitable frameworks in C# that I can use to create a REST API on all user machines (as opposed to using sockets)?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>  <p>Edit: Apologies for the lack of clarity. I would like to develop an app on iOS and Android that talks to the user's machine. In order to do this, I need a server on the user's machine that will perform the actions that I request from the mobile device. I want to avoid using sockets as a REST API will suffice and makes development easier. I believe WCF can achieve this but might be overkill for a simple app that talks to a user's machine. Web API seeems like something that would be the solution but happy to hear if I'm taking a wrong approach to this.</p>
