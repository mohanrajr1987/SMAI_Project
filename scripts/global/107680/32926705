<p>This seems to be a common issue but I haven't found a solution that actually works. I've tried installing both Lithium and Helium on Ubuntu using the Installation Guide from the wiki. Following this guide the only feature that gets installed is odl-l2switch-switch-ui which should also install the DLUX Web Interface. I can access it fine using http://:8181/index.html but I get the 'Unable to Login' error when i try to log in using admin / admin. I've tried the various fixes that include installing several features in the correct order. And I've deleted the data directory, then reinstalled the features, but I cannot get it to log in. I am installing on Ubuntu Server, not on Ubuntu Desktop. It seems unlikely that that's causing the issue but it's worth noting.</p>
