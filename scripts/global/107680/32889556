<p>I am a beginner in AngularJS. I used the $resource service to get a specific object of type person based on its <strong>id</strong> from the server in order to update this object.</p>  <p><strong>Resource service:</strong></p>  <pre><code>moduleName.factory('Person', function ($resource) {   return $resource('/application/person/:id', {}, {         show: { method: 'GET' , params: {id: '@id'}},   }); }); </code></pre>  <p>The object that I received and it displayed in my browser using the {{}} is:</p>  <pre><code>      {   "id": "560cf96ee85532035928889e",   "firstName": "Christiane",   "gender": "Male",   "flight": {     "id": null,     "arrivalDate": "2015-01-05 11:30",     "arrivalAirport": {       "name": "Frankfurt"     },     "stopovers": []   } } </code></pre>  <p>In this form I have a dropdownlist that contains the Airport list, I expect that the value of the arrivalAirport will be selected in this dropdown list, but no value was selected, I try to set the selected value of this dropdown list in the AngularJs controller of this view.Before setting the value of this object I try to access to their value by this code inside the controller.</p>  <pre><code>moduleName.controller('PersonDetailController',function ($scope, $routeParams, Person,$location) {                 $scope.person = Person.show({id: $routeParams.id});                 console.log($scope.person.flight.arrivalAirport);         }); </code></pre>  <p>when I want to get the value of the object <strong>flight.arrivalAirport</strong> nested in  <strong>person</strong> object I got this error.</p>  <p><strong>TypeError: Cannot read property 'arrivalAirport' of undefined</strong> </p>  <p>How can I display the right value selected in the dropdown list and how can I access to the other object like <strong>stopovers</strong> array in order to update their values?</p>  <p><strong>Thank you.</strong></p>
