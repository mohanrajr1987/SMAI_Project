<p>I am trying to read and clear event logs on remote server through WMI and C#.</p>  <p>I successfully read all the events but I am not getting any clue to clear out the logs so that already read events do not read again.</p>  <pre><code>ManagementPath path = new ManagementPath()         {             NamespacePath = @"root\cimv2",             Server = "N-ISB-TEC-67382"         }; ManagementScope scope = new ManagementScope(path); scope.Connect(); SelectQuery query = new SelectQuery("SELECT * FROM Win32_NTLogEvent"); ManagementObjectSearcher searcher = new ManagementObjectSearcher(scope, query); foreach (ManagementObject mObj in searcher.Get()) {         mObj.GetMethodParameters("ClearEventLog");//Exception; not implemented in any class } </code></pre>  <p>I saw the above mentioned exception line at some link and tried this too but not getting any luck.</p>  <p>Waiting for quick response, thanks in advance.</p>
