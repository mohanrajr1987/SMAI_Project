<p>I have to submit project, where I have a mysql database server running on my machine. How can I connect my android device with the server but I am not allowed internet access on the laptop. I tried creating a hotspot by,</p>  <pre><code>netsh wlan set hostednetwork mode=allow ssid=YourSSIDName key=YourKey </code></pre>  <p>and <code>netsh wlan start hostednetwork</code>. My device connects to hotspot but I am unable to connect to the mysql server. I tried with the IP address of the laptop but in vain. Any solutions will be appreciated. </p>
