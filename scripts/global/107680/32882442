<p>I am trying to connect sql server database with php using yii2 framework. Initially it was connected easily vai dblib (php5-sybase) extension of php. But after that i don't what mistake i did it is not connecting. My system configuration is --</p>  <ul> <li>Ubuntu 14.10</li> <li>PHP 5.9 with pdo_dblib</li> </ul>  <p>The same thing is working on another system having same configuration. I have performed a complete reverse engineering process on that also i have reinstall everything twice but failed to connect that. So i just want to know if any one had faced the same problem and can tell me approx or exact issue or cause by which it is happening so.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
