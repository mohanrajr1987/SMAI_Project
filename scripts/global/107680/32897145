<p>I have a script (in a server) that it's making a list of consultations within my Linux environment and on the other hand I have a developer that has builded a GUI with Xampp (with access to the mentioned server) that will show the output of that .sh script. The output is something like this:</p>  <p><code>TYP     HSTNAME CLDB    ZKPR    NFS     WBSVR   FLSVR   JBT     TSKT    HBM</code></p>  <p><code>Data    server1  1       0       1       0       1       0       1       0</code></p>  <p>So, yes, it is a table that xamp program will take to validate if the server has or hasn't the specified service at the top of this table. But do you know if it is possible with a GUI builded with xamp, to launch a script located on a Linux server?. I imagine is something preaty much as Npgsql for postgress but I don't know for sure.</p>
