<p>A website that I have created. Runs fine when I run it locally but when on the Azure server it becomes unstable. </p>  <p>I managed to find a repeatable method to causing it to crash. However it then it just started working after the server slowed down across multiple devices trying to load the site.</p>  <p>The Site is written in C# and ASP.Net, It can be fairly heavy on MSSQL queries as well.</p>
