<p>How can i check if two servers are connected from a third server in c#? I am in server A and i want to know if Server B and Server C are connected. I only have the code to check if I am connected to server B or C. What I have:</p>  <pre><code>public bool AreConnected(string ip)         {             bool connected= false;             Ping p = new Ping();             try             {                                 PingReply reply = p.Send(ip);                 connected = reply.Status == IPStatus.Success;             }             catch (PingException)             {                 // Discard PingExceptions and return false;             }             return connected;         } </code></pre>
