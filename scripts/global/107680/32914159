<p>I'm new to Marklogic so downloaded the Windows server version of the product from the developer site to start some learning. When I tried to follow the "getting started" tutorial, I'm finding that on accessing <a href="http://localhost:8000" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8000</a>, this brings up the query console and not the server entry page as suggested in the documentation. The tutorial seems to be consistent across version 6 and version 7 but the documentation doesn't seem quite there for version 8. So I'm hoping someone knowledgeable from the marklogic dev community could confirm whether I've done something wrong or if, as I suspect, something's changed and the documentation is out of alignment.</p>  <p>The server entry page looks like a better way to get started with the product that trying to dive into the query page so if it's there, just hidden away, is there a URL I could enter to get to it?</p>  <p>Also, if anyone could point me towards a good tutorial around loading and analysing flat text documents that would be great.</p>  <p>Many thanks</p>  <p>Mamaq</p>
