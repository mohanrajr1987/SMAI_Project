<p>In working with wso2emm, I've noticed a particular behavior that we'd like to change on our end.  This is that when you issue a deploy to a set of devices, the server will send one json message informing the client of a new update to their software, and if anything goes wrong in the process of downloading the update, the json message is lost.</p>  <p>I've saved this on the client end so that we can catch errors and retry and resume downloads.  My question is, since I'm unfamiliar with a lot of web development, where would one look to modify the logic for sending out messages to mobile clients?  </p>
