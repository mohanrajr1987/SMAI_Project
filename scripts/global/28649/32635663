<p>I am creating a view within IB and and attempting to have 3 <code>UILabels</code> evenly space horizontally across the view. I came across this on SO, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/30249550/4597666">http://stackoverflow.com/a/30249550/4597666</a>. I have three <code>UILabels</code>, each have the height and width constrained. Here is what the IB looks like:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/dlWEG.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/dlWEG.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I constrained each centered horizontally, and the first <code>UILabel</code> I have the multiplier <code>3:1</code>, second, <code>3:3</code>, third <code>3:5</code> like the post states.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/MgO9B.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/MgO9B.png" alt="enter image description here"></a><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/JT6i8.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/JT6i8.png" alt="enter image description here"></a><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/MihG1.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/MihG1.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>When I run on my emulator, I don't get the result that I was expecting. It appears all three <code>UILabel</code>s are centered horizontally, and the first and third are not offset. </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/mBqgS.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/mBqgS.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Is there another setting that I'm missing, or another way to properly space the views evenly?</p>
