<p>I have upgraded my xcode and now using Swift 2.0. I have an issue with all components which I set at runtime and used to rely on </p>  <p><code>setTranslatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints</code></p>  <p>It seems that the method is no longer available and I had to comment out the code. As a result, all positioning is messed up....(impacting, buttons, labels, images shapes)</p>  <p>Any idea how to approach this problem?</p>
