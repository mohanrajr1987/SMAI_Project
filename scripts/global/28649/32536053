<p>I am displaying a label on UI in iOS using code, not from storyboard. When the size of the label is large then it does display accurate it go outside the view so I decided to use <code>sizeToFit</code> in iOS. But when I apply this thing on label then it does appear on view. Please tell why my label does not appear in this case.</p>  <p>Here is the code for the label:</p>  <pre><code> self.label_company = [[UILabel alloc]initWithFrame:CGRectMake(60, 30, 150, 100)]; [self.label_company setFont:[UIFont fontWithName:@"HelveticaNeue" size:12]]; </code></pre>
