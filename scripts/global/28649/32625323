Both <code>UILabel</code>'s text will be populated via Web Data and could be any length. </p>  <p>When the <code>"Something"</code> label inevitably gets populated with something longer than <code>"something"</code>, the <code>UIImageView</code> to it's immediate right needs to move to the right based on the amount of text inside the <code>"something"</code> label.</p>  <p>How would one go about doing this? </p>
