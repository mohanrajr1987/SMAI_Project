<p>I have a custom UITableViewCell that contains a UILabel. I'm using Auto Layout and have the constraints properly set up. </p>  <p>I'm running into an issue where some of the UILabels are taller than they need to be while the table view is in edit mode (there are no problems when the table view isn't in edit mode). Some sections in the table view are allowed to be reordered or deleted, and some are not. I've noticed that <em>only</em> the cells that aren't allowed to be removed or reordered are having this problem. I believe the UILabel is sizing its height based on its width if it were indented on the right to show the reorder control. </p>  <p>There was actually more extra height in the problematic cells before, but I improved the situation by returning <code>true</code> in <code>tableView(tableView: UITableView, shouldIndentWhileEditingRowAtIndexPath indexPath: NSIndexPath).</code> Of course, I'd rather not indent the cells if I can avoid it. If I prevent any cells from being reordered, the problem disappears completely. </p>  <p>I've read many answers to other questions about improperly sizing UILabels that suggest to create a UILabel subclass and set the label's <code>preferredMaxLayoutWidth</code> property. I've tried that and it doesn't seem to solve the problem. </p>  <p>I have changed the background color of the UILabel to make sure the problem really lies in the height of the label. The text appears to be centered vertically in the label.</p>  <p>Is there any way to only allow some cells to be indented while still having Auto Layout correctly calculate UILabel heights?</p>
