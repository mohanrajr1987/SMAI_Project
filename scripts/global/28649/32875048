<p>I've run into a very hard to track down issue in my app. So, before iOS 9 I had a TableView that displayed a couple of multi line labels, these all still display on multiple lines, however, on an iPhone 5s or below, on iOS 9, these lines truncate instead of wrapping.</p>  <p>To add yet another layer of complexity onto this, it only seems to happen in the first and last <em>multi-line</em> cells. There's only ever three cells that this issue could affect, if cells 1-3 are all multi-line, cells 1 and 3 will be truncated and cell 2 will be fine. If cells 1 and 2 are multi line but 3 is not, cells 1 and 2 will truncate and cell 3 will be fine (obviously, single line)</p>  <p>Basically, I am trying to setup a tableview with 3 cells, which are almost always multi line. However, the first and last cells do not show as multi line cells on an iPhone 5s or lower running iOS 9. If the user is still on iOS 8, the cells get laid out fine, or on an iPhone 6 or 6s.</p>  <p>Does anyone know anything in the iOS 9 SDK that may have changed to cause this type of issue? I suspect it is something to do with how UILabels get sized that changed, but I can't for the life of me figure out why it would only affect the first and last multi-line cell in the table view.</p>  <p>I'd appreciate any help, or any ideas pointing towards anything at all that I could look into.</p>  <p>Edit: More info: I'm using a custom UILabel that calls <code>sizeToFit</code> every time the text is set. Whenever <code>layoutSubviews</code> or <code>intrinsicContentSize</code> is called, it sets the <code>numberOfLines</code> to 0. <code>preferredMaxLayoutWidth</code> is also set to be the width of the label's bounds in these methods, as well as anytime the bounds are set on the label.</p>  <p>Another interesting point: Whenever <code>drawTextInRect:</code> is called, it chooses it's height based off of the minimum of either the height returned by calling <code>[self sizeThatFirst:rect.size]</code> on the CGRect given to the method, or the height of the numberOfLines * lineHeight, and this always returns a very consistent 53, for the multi or single line labels, so it is recognizing that it should be multiple lines, but for some reason, still truncates instead of word wrapping?</p>
