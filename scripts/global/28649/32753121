<p>I have a game made with Unity, and combined it with iOS (provided as library) to provide some native features.</p>  <p>I use this <a href="https://github.com/haxpor/UnityNativePrototype" rel="nofollow">UnityNativePrototype</a> which I forked from original creator <a href="https://github.com/samizzo" rel="nofollow">samizzo</a>. It works fine, but right after I tested it with iPad 2. Things seem to be not right.</p>  <p>A little bit of concept of integration between iOS and Unity is this. I have 3 projects</p>  <ol> <li>iOS Library (storyboard, native code, etc)</li> <li>iOS Test app (to consume iOS library and quickly test things out)</li> <li>Unity project (generated XCode project of Unity game)</li> </ol>  <p>Whenever I want to test all things together, I combine 1. and 3. together. Only 2. I use for quick testing because integrating a final app between Unity and iOS requires time.</p>  <p>I use size class to set font size for <code>UILabel</code>in Storyboard. I tested it with 2. and it works fine. But <strong>problem</strong> occurs whenever I test it with integrated app, <code>UILabel</code> sets back to use default font size I have set with size class Any:Any. It suddenly changes after I touch on the view. I even applied work around by sub-classing <code>UILabel</code> then override <code>setFont</code> method to force setting a correct font size. It works but has a problem with layout later on in which no matter I call <code>layoutIfNeeded</code> on the view, it doesn't look like. </p>  <p>The following is debug log I print it out to see if there's a call to set new font to <code>UILabel</code>. And it did...</p>  <pre><code>2015-09-24 08:11:09.501 ProductName[1475:611412] Some changes going on here...&lt;UICTFont: 0x19177700&gt; font-family: ".SFUIDisplay-Regular"; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-size: 24.00pt 2015-09-24 08:11:36.896 ProductName[1475:611412] Some changes going on here...&lt;UICTFont: 0x156754a0&gt; font-family: ".SFUIText-Regular"; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-size: 17.00pt </code></pre>  <p>Above, firstly it normally sets font &amp; font-size according to what I've set in Storyboard. But then it is called to set again. This time back to normal which I don't want.</p>  <p>The following is call stack. Please note that it seems so normal that the call is not initiated from Unity native support classes, or even my own project.</p>  <pre><code>2015-09-24 09:59:58.265 ProductName[1605:635812] Stracktrace: (     0   ProductName                         0x00bee2a3 -[UILabelFix setFont:] + 182     1   Foundation                          0x24fb3e1b &lt;redacted&gt; + 226     2   UIKit                               0x286559e7 &lt;redacted&gt; + 174     3   Foundation                          0x24fc62e3 &lt;redacted&gt; + 310     4   UIKit                               0x287776d7 &lt;redacted&gt; + 322     5   UIKit                               0x28776d11 &lt;redacted&gt; + 192     6   UIKit                               0x28648edd &lt;redacted&gt; + 80     7   UIKit                               0x28648f9f &lt;redacted&gt; + 134     8   UIKit                               0x28649211 &lt;redacted&gt; + 44     9   UIKit                               0x28b32f79 &lt;redacted&gt; + 144     10  UIKit                               0x286491cd &lt;redacted&gt; + 320     11  UIKit                               0x28359429 &lt;redacted&gt; + 660     12  QuartzCore                          0x27c2aad1 &lt;redacted&gt; + 128     13  QuartzCore                          0x27c261cd &lt;redacted&gt; + 348     14  QuartzCore                          0x27c26061 &lt;redacted&gt; + 16     15  QuartzCore                          0x27c25581 &lt;redacted&gt; + 368     16  QuartzCore                          0x27c25243 &lt;redacted&gt; + 590     17  QuartzCore                          0x27c771cf &lt;redacted&gt; + 762     18  IOMobileFramebuffer                 0x2dab857b &lt;redacted&gt; + 86     19  IOKit                               0x2534df29 IODispatchCalloutFromCFMessage + 256     20  CoreFoundation                      0x2424b0d9 &lt;redacted&gt; + 132     21  CoreFoundation                      0x2425d3f3 &lt;redacted&gt; + 34     22  CoreFoundation                      0x2425cb07 &lt;redacted&gt; + 342     23  CoreFoundation                      0x2425af19 &lt;redacted&gt; + 1688     24  CoreFoundation                      0x241ae249 CFRunLoopRunSpecific + 520     25  CoreFoundation                      0x241ae035 CFRunLoopRunInMode + 108     26  GraphicsServices                    0x2d277ad1 GSEventRunModal + 160     27  UIKit                               0x283c38a9 UIApplicationMain + 144     28  ProductName                         0x000c16bb main + 202     29  libdyld.dylib                       0x3635e873 &lt;redacted&gt; + 2 ) </code></pre>  <p>What might be the problem here? Why <code>UIKit</code> decides to update <code>UILabel</code> again back to normal which is not the expected behavior?</p>  <p>I suspect Unity's iOS native support class might get involved, but after seeing above I don't think so. This problem happens to all <code>UILabel</code> <strong>only</strong> and <strong>only</strong> for those that have multiple size class set for different font size.</p>  <p><strong>FYI</strong>: I use Xcode 7.0 (7A220), and Unity 5.2.1f1.</p>
