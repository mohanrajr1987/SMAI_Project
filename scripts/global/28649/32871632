<p>I have an NSString and I want to know how much of that string will fit into a UILabel. </p>  <p>My code builds a test string by adding one character at a time from my original string. Each time I add a character I test the new string to see if it will fit into my label:</p>  <pre><code>CGRect cutTextRect = [cutText boundingRectWithSize:maximumLabelSize options:NSStringDrawingUsesLineFragmentOrigin attributes:stringAttributes context:nil]; </code></pre>  <p>Then I compare the height of that rect to the height of my label to see if the string overflowed. </p>  <p>This works, but instruments shows me that the loop is taking up all my cpu time.</p>  <p>Can anyone think of or know of a faster way to do this? </p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
