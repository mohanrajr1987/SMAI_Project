<p>I have a UILabel in interface builder that I've connected to a property, but it's staying nil through the viewDidLoad on that view controller. I've been stepping through and as soon as the DetailViewController is initialized, the label property is there but it is nil and it never seems to be initialized. </p>  <p>It was working until I switched from using segues to doing pushViewController on the navigation controller.   </p>  <pre><code>// DetailsViewController.h  #import &lt;UIKit/UIKit.h&gt; #import "TLitem.h"  @interface DetailsViewController : UIViewController  @property (nonatomic, strong) TLitem *entry; @property (weak, nonatomic) IBOutlet UILabel *entryLabel;  @end </code></pre>  <p>Then in a table view in another view controller:</p>  <pre><code>// EntryListViewController.m  DetailsViewController *details = [[DetailsViewController alloc] init]; [details setEntry:entry]; [self.navigationController pushViewController:details animated:YES]; </code></pre>  <p>And in the viewDidLoad:</p>  <pre><code>// DetailsViewController.m - (void)viewDidLoad {     [super viewDidLoad];     [self.view setBackgroundColor:[UIColor yellowColor]];     TLitem *entry = [self entry];     UILabel *label = [self entryLabel];      label.text = [entry valueForKey:@"text"]; </code></pre>
