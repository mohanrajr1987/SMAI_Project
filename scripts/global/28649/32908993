<p>I have been trying to add a label on top of an image but the label is under the image and I've tried turning AutoLayout off, adding constraints and moving tried moving the label on top of and on bottom of the UIImageView in the View controller scene but its still under neither. Anybody know a quick fix? <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/BTlbp.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/BTlbp.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
