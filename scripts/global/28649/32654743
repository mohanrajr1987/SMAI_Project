<p>I don't know if it is something that I am doing wrong but each time there is a significant iOS update 6 to 7, 7 to 8 and again from 8 to 9 some <code>UILabel</code> seem to not be big enough and I see " ..." as the label is truncated. I now have to go through the app and reset all the sizes of such fields. Does anyone else have this this problem and if so is there a way of fixing it for good?</p>
