<p>Simple problem but can't find the answer.</p>  <p>In xcode, I have set up a simple UIView with dark background color and on this UIView I have put an UILabel. When I run the app, the label is not shown. Debugging the view hierarchy shows me that for some reason, the UIView is displayed in front of the UILabel.</p>  <p>How can I set the UILabel in front of the UIView? I remember encountering the same problem in XCode 6 and was able to bring the UILabel to front but can't now find any advice on how to do this on XCode 7.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
