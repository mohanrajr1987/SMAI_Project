<p>In my app (a game), I have a bunch of N (number of players) moveable UILabels distributed around the edges of the screen. The <code>label.text</code> is pulled from a <code>PlayerNamesArray</code>. One of the Labels should randomly be designated as the first element (which I can already do). What I'm having trouble with is, is there someway in which I can then allocate in clockwise, the text of the next label to be the next element in an updated <code>PlayerNamesArray</code> ?  (or I could just make a new array)</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/dsaDd.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/dsaDd.png" alt="Very basic illustration"></a></p>  <p>For example, if MR was the first element, then the array would be <code>@[@"MR",@"RE", @"QW", ... @"CD"]</code></p>  <p>I'm finding this hard because the labels can be moved anywhere along the edges of the view before the "start" button is pressed (so the order could be anything) and only after that is the position of the labels fixed.</p>  <p>Does anyone have any pointers or ideas as to what I can do to solve this problem?</p>
