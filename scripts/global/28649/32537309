<p>I want to change the title of an UILabel, but I receive an EXC_BAD_INSTRUCTION error.<br> My label was correctly connected to the storyboard and I don't understand why i have an error.  Could anybody please point where I am wrong? Thank you for your help. </p>  <p>There is my code :</p>  <pre><code>class ViewController: UIViewController {     @IBOutlet weak var numberLabel: UILabel!     override func viewDidLoad() {         super.viewDidLoad()         self.numberLabel.text = "qwerty" // Thread 1: EXC_BAD_INSTRUCTION (code=EXC_I386_INVOP,subcode0x0)     } } </code></pre>
