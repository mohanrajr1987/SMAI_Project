<p>I am trying to make a custom UIView in which a label on the view starts as a two-line preview of text, then grows to the size of the text when the view is pulled down to make room for the bigger label. I want the transition to crossfade between the two sizes. If I set the frame inside the animation block, it animates with the label coming in from off-screen at the new size instead of just crossfading. If I put it in the completion block, it doesn't crossfade animate at all. I'm sure I am doing something dumb, here. Note that I am using transitionWithView in the example code below, but the same thing happens with animateWithDuration...</p>  <pre><code>CGSize newSize = [self.label.text boundingRectWithSize:CGSizeMake(self.label.frame.size.width, MAXFLOAT)                                                     options:NSStringDrawingUsesLineFragmentOrigin                                                  attributes:@{                                                               NSFontAttributeName : self.label.font                                                               }                                                     context:nil].size;  CGRect newRect = CGRectMake(self.label.frame.origin.x, self.label.frame.origin.y, self.label.frame.size.width, newSize.height);  [UIView transitionWithView:self duration:0.3 options:UIViewAnimationOptionTransitionCrossDissolve animations:^{         self.label.numberOfLines = 0;     } completion:^(BOOL finished) {          self.label.frame = newRect;         self.label.backgroundColor = [UIColor orangeColor];     }]; </code></pre>
