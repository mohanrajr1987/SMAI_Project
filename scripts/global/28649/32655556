<p>The following block of code was working in iOS7 and 8 but when I updated to iOS9 the number of lines is always returning as 0.</p>  <p>Is there anything obvious that needs to change></p>  <pre><code> NSInteger lineCount = 0; CGSize textSize = CGSizeMake(self.messageLabel.frame.size.width, MAXFLOAT); int rHeight = (int)lroundf([self.messageLabel sizeThatFits:textSize].height); int charSize = (int)lroundf(self.messageLabel.font.leading); lineCount = rHeight/charSize; NSLog(@"No of lines: %li",(long)lineCount); </code></pre>
