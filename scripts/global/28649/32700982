<p>For reason I had to use a Label instead of a button. Now I try to figure out how to pretend it's a regular button. Important point: Highlighting the text while the label is pressed (Action realized with a <code>UITapGestureRecognizer</code>). So I tried to find any gesture that realizes when a touch ends but I don't find anything :(</p>  <p>Any suggestions?</p>  <p>Regards, Patrick</p>
