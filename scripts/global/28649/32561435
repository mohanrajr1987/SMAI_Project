<p>I want to make sure the button text fits into a UIButton, while the UIButton has a fixed size. </p>  <p>Of course I can access the titleLabel of the UIButton. In a label I would set <code>autoshrink</code> to minimum font scale which seems to correspond to </p>  <pre><code>self.myButton.titleLabel.adjustsFontSizeToFitWidth = YES; </code></pre>  <p>, but doesn't really behave the same, since it only makes the text fits horizontally into the bounds, not vertically, thereby not changing the font size.</p>  <p>How can i actually adjust the font size of a label programmatically to make the text fit into the label bounds (as shown in  <strong>Goal</strong>  in the picture below) ?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/SWpDJ.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/SWpDJ.png" alt="adjustsFontSizeToFitWidth does not actually adjust the font size to fit the frame, only the width"></a></p>  <p>I already tried </p>  <pre><code>self.myButton.titleLabel.numberOfLines = 0; self.myButton.titleLabel.minimumScaleFactor = 0.5f; </code></pre>  <p>without success, always ended up as in <code>adjustsFontSizeToFitWidth</code> on the left side of the pic above.</p>  <p><strong>Edit</strong>: <em>The solution also has to be ios7 compliant</em></p>
