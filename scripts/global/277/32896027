<p>I'm hoping someone who uses Xcode has a workaround for this ancient Xcode bug...</p>  <p>When stopped on breakpoint, Xcode tries to evaluate a local variable which isn't even declared until later in the function, and goes into an infinite loop trying to evaluate the variable.</p>  <p>NOTE: one method I use to work around this Xcode bug is to scroll the offending variable out of view in the Variables View pane.</p>  <p>The local variable has not been initialized yet, so the debugger is grabbing a trash value off the stack, and evaluating that instead.</p>  <p>Below, "SomeStackTrash" is just an arbitrary class name I made up. It represents the trash value on the stack, which often is a valid object, but one that should be evaluated by the debugger. You see something like this in the console pane:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>2015-10-01 14:33:39.138 Mbox Remote[55436:303] -[SomeStackTrash   count]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x308e440</p>      <p>2015-10-01 14:33:39.322 Mbox Remote[55436:303] -[SomeStackTrash   count]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x308e440</p>      <p>2015-10-01 14:33:39.529 Mbox Remote[55436:303] -[SomeStackTrash   count]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x308e440</p>      <p>2015-10-01 14:33:39.654 Mbox Remote[55436:303] -[SomeStackTrash   count]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x308e440</p>      <p>2015-10-01 14:33:39.869 Mbox Remote[55436:303] -[SomeStackTrash   count]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x308e440</p>      <p>(lldb)</p> </blockquote>  <p>Steps to Reproduce: Write a function like this:</p>  <pre><code>- (void) foo {    [self foobar];  // set breakpoint here     NSArray *myarray = [self getAnArray];    ... } </code></pre>  <p>hit the breakpoint, and see the debugger try to evaluate NSArray *myarray over and over again, even though it hasn't yet been declared!</p>  <p>Expected Results: don't evaluate local variables that have not been inited</p>  <p>Actual Results:  local variables get evaluated when they shouldn't</p>  <p>Version: All versions of Xcode 5 and 6, up to Version 6.2 (6C131e)</p>  <p>Configuration: Mac Pro late 2013</p>  <p>A more specific example. local variable in Variables Pane:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>ctxFixtures   NSArray *   @"0 objects"    0x0308e440</p> </blockquote>  <p>If I enter this in debugger console:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>(lldb) po ctxFixtures </p>      <p>(lldb) po *ctxFixtures 2015-10-01 15:19:03.818 Mbox Remote[55436:303]   -[PmPatchListTable count]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x308e440  {}</p> </blockquote>  <p>Again, PmPatchListTable is just an arbitrary trash pointer on the stack, which in this case happens to be an NSTableView subclass.</p>
