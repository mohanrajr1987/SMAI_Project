<p>Environment:  Delphi XE6, Windows 8.1, Excel 2013, Add-In Express Version 7.8 Release (build 1223, which is the current release).</p>  <p>I am building a plug-In for Excel using Add-In Express. This is version 2, which was a major rewrite, so many things changed.  I am now getting two odd behaviors.   Everything compiles and runs….  </p>  <p>Odd behavior number 1.  On exiting Excel, I get 7 AVs, one immediately after the other. Specifically exception class $C0000005 with message 'access violation… read of address…'  This issue is that this happens even though I can’t find any of my code that is running.  From Delphi, I ‘Run with Debugging’.  This automatically starts Excel.  I get the normal splash screen telling me what plug-ins are being loaded.  Mine is listed.  The first Excel screen I see asks me what file to open.  I immediately close Excel.  I now get my AVs.</p>  <p>Something I am running is AV’ing on exit.  I have basically commented out everything I can think of.</p>  <p>My .dpr file does NOT have any code between ‘begin’ and end’. My AddInModule (which is where the DLL/my plugin) starts only has one routine,  AddInModuleStartupComplete, and the very first line is ‘Exit’. I have commented out all code in the ‘initization’ on every form except the AddInModule, which only had only line added by Add-in Express</p>  <pre><code>TadxFactory.Create(ComServer, TPaylay, CLASS_Paylay, TAddInModule); </code></pre>  <p>My whole app only has FINALIZATION code in 2 places, and both only contain lines similar to </p>  <pre><code> if Assigned(DM1) then     DM1.Free; </code></pre>  <p>This brings me to my 2nd issue. I tried using Madshi MadExcept.  When I use that, I get a stack overflow when I start Excel.  I have increased stack size from 1 MB to 12 MB, and I still get stack overflows.</p>  <p>I am at a loss what to try next to debug this.  I have tried viewing the AV  address, and I just get assembly code. What do I do next to try to isolate where I am getting my errors?</p>
