<p>I have deployed a node.js app in Bluemix using <code>cf push</code>. I have removed the start: entry from manifest.yml. In Bluemix I have set the environment variable <code>BLUEMIX_APP_MGMT_ENABLE</code>to <code>devconsole+shell+inspector</code>. This restages the app. </p>  <p>But when I open the App Manager by adding <code>/bluemix-debug/manage/</code> I get a 404 error.</p>  <p>When I start Live Edit on the same project from DevOps Services I can open the App Manager. But I don't see what is different, it also seems to set the environment variable only.</p>  <p>What am I missing?</p>
