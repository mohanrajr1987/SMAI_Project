<p>I am trying to debug a simple DropWizard application in Eclipse, in an attempt to familiarise myself with it. I can start the jvm from the command line like this:</p>  <pre><code>java -Xdebug -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,address=9999,server=y,suspend=n -jar dropwizard-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar server config.yaml </code></pre>  <p>And then connect to it as a remote java app.</p>  <p>Or I can find the application class (containing the main method) in eclipse and launch the application in debug that way. Both these methods appear to successfully start the application in debug, and sure enough, if I set a break point somewhere, it gets hit.</p>  <p>My problem, however, is that Eclipse would normally at this point give me some control over the application but in this case is rather oddly not allowing me to resume, or use any step commands. I can't do anything other than terminate the application.</p>  <p>Perhaps I am having a stupid morning, but I cannot fathom why this is happening.  Can anyone shed any light on this and how I can gain the control required to debug?</p>
