<p>I have defined a new type in my haskell code, which takes a list of lists of strings as a record. An example might be<br> <code>Board{size=(4,7),pieces=[["OA","AA","AA"],["BBB","BOO"],["OCCC","CCCO","OOCO"]]}</code>  </p>  <p>I've set it up as a derived instance of <code>Show</code> and <code>Read</code>. If I just input the code above into ghci, then I get out exactly what I put in, which is fine. However, if I call it with show, I get<br> <code>"Board {size = (4,7), pieces = [[\"OA\",\"AA\",\"AA\"],[\"BBB\",\"BOO\"],[\"OCCC\",\"CCCO\",\"OOCO\"]]}"</code><br> The speech marks are fine, but I've no idea why the backslashes are there. Are you not allowed to next speech marks or something? In any case, this now totally breaks if I try to call <code>read</code> to get it back. I get a long error trying to tell me that none of the strings are data constructors - I don't know why it thinks they are.  </p>  <p>Is there any way round this?</p>
