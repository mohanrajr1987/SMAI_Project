<p>I have read <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21033553/cython-debugging-put-a-break-point">Cython debugging, put a break point</a>, and <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/apam-python-users/6rsRwcCAms4" rel="nofollow">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/apam-python-users/6rsRwcCAms4</a> and wondering what the best workflow is when debugging cython code that is called from python code?</p>  <p>Ideally I would like to step into .pyx files during a python debugging session initiated from my IDE (pycharm), but it seems this is impossible. Isn't it possible to compile debug information when the pyx files are cythonized so that the debugger can step in?</p>  <p>If this can't be achieved, what are the alternatives (apart from not using cython!)?</p>  <p>As this question specifically asks how to step into cython code, although it is similar to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32520976/cython-python-project-test-driven-development-and-pyx-file-structure-advice">Cython &amp; Python Project Test Driven Development and .pyx file structure advice</a>, it is not the same.</p>
