<p>When I try to debug a C++ project in Eclipse (with MinGW and GDB) I get the error </p>  <blockquote>   <p>No source available for "main() at 0x463150"</p> </blockquote>  <p>If I click on "View Disassembly" it points to the line <code>-&gt;00463150:   sub $0x6c,%esp</code></p>  <p>My command options are <code>-O0 -g3 -Wall -c -fmessage-length=0</code></p>  <p>The project is a platforming game that is made with SDL. I can run it without problems, but debugging doesn't work.</p>  <p>Any suggestions?</p>
