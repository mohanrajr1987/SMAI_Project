<p>I'm having a strange issue related to threads that I'm having trouble tracking down.</p>  <p>I'm getting the error:  <strong>Modifications to the layout engine must not be performed from a background thread.</strong>  </p>  <p>This means I probably am doing an update of a UI component (somewhere) not on the main thread - however I can't seem to track this down from my stack trace.</p>  <p>Here is where I break:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/yTZvq.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/yTZvq.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>But the problem is its only showing assembly </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/QAkUV.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/QAkUV.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>in xcode and I'm not sure 100% exactly how to track this issue down.</p>  <p>When I open the stack and look through the other threads they don't "seem" to be doing anything related to the UI at all.  </p>  <p>Is there some <code>lldb</code> commands I should type or any advice how to see what actually caused my exception here?</p>
