<p>I want to step through a pyx file contained in a python package (sklearn to be precise). Particularly I want to launch a python script and break when the binary code of a particular line in a certain pyx file is executed. I read some howtos (like <a href="http://docs.cython.org/src/userguide/debugging.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.cython.org/src/userguide/debugging.html</a>) but none of them seems to say how to do this. The only one which seems to address my particular problem is <a href="http://whoateallthepy.blogspot.com/2012/08/quick-cython-debugging.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> article, but I'd like to have a cleaner solution.</p>
