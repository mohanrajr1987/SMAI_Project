<p>I'm programming Python using Notepad++ and the command line, without an IDE.</p>  <p>I learned how to basically use Pdb. It's pretty cool. I wonder: should I use this for regular use, or should I use a debugger with a GUI?</p>  <p>If I should go with the second option, what debuggers do you recommend? I'm a Windows user.</p>
