<p>Under flask, I want to include/exclude stuff in the jinja template based upon whether, or not, we are in debug mode.  I'm not debating if this is a good, or bad, idea (i'd vote 'bad' but want to do it just for this case nonetheless :-), so how might this best happen?</p>  <p>I was hoping i would not have to pass the variable explicitly into the template, unlike this:</p>  <pre><code>render_template('foo.html', debug=app.debug) </code></pre>  <p>not that this would be too hard, but I'd rather just magically say in the template:</p>  <pre><code>{% if debug %}       go crazzzzy {% endif %} </code></pre>  <p>Is there some default variable just lazing about waiting for me to pounce?</p>
