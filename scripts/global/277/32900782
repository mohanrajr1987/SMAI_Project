<p>I am using c# in visual studio 2013 and for some reason i am not able to see output of program on output window. I have looked at other articles related to this but none of them could fix the issue. </p>  <p>I have used <code>Debug.WriteLine</code>, <code>Debug.Write</code>, <code>Console.Write</code>, <code>Console.WriteLine</code>,  have unchecked the "Send output to Immediate Window". But none of them seem to display the output.</p>
