<p>I found this website <a href="http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit" rel="nofollow">http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit</a> which allows you to run your code line by line and at each line see the values of the variables, which being new to python makes it very helpful when debugging. I was wondering if there is a program that does the same thing? I have heard of pdb but I would rather have a GUI. Thanks</p>
