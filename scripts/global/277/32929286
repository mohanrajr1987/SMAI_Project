<p>This bug just started happening where I cant run the debugger without it closing every source tab. Not only that, but I cant view any of the tabs without reopening the entire solution.</p>  <p>If i ctrl-f5 to run, it doesnt close the source-tabs however, wich makes me think its about the debugger itself.</p>  <p>Anyone have a similar issue happen, that perhaps know how to remedy it?</p>
