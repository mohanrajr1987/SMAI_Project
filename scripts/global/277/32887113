<p>I would like to program in threading building blocks with tasks. But how does one do the debugging in practice?</p>  <p>In general the print method is a solid technique for debugging programs.  In my experience with MPI parallelization, the right way to do logging is that each thread print its debugging information in its own file (say "debug_irank" with irank the rank in the MPI_COMM_WORLD) so that the logical errors can be found.</p>  <p>How can something similar be achieved with TBB? It is not clear how to access the thread number in the thread pool as this is obviously something internal to tbb.</p>  <p>Alternatively, one could add an additional index specifying the rank when a task is generated but this makes the code rather complicated since the whole program has to take care of that.</p>
