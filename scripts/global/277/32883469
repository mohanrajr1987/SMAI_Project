<p>Is there a way to print the last executed SQL statement wihin a stored procedure? </p>  <p>I found out about </p>  <pre><code>DBCC INPUTBUFFER(@@SPID) </code></pre>  <p>but that only prints the last bigger portion, i.e. the procedure run. I'd like to accomplish the same for each statement run from within the stored procedure.</p>  <p>We have a huge procedure with about 30 SQL statements. We'd like this procedure to output all the SQL statements when run with @debug = 1 parameter. We've had success with doing that when the queries are dynamic and constructed into a varchar that is run with EXEC, but what about non-dynamic queries? Is it possible to print those as well? </p>
