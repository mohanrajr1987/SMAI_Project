<p>I opened up a recently made Xcode project. I am extremely frustrated that I can't add new images(.png) in the group "images".</p>  <p>Even worse, when I delete a folder to replace it with a new folder, I can't get the reference back and it autosaves.</p>  <ol> <li>Delete group images (Images->Asia->landscape.png, buldings.png)</li> <li>Create Group Images </li> <li>Drag subdirectory (Asia) underneath images folder in xcode copy references</li> <li>Doesn't appear ?! in xcode.</li> </ol>
