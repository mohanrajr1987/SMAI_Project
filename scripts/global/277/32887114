<p>There is a project, that I am working on. I am new to that project. Problem is when I click on submit button on certain JSP page, it prints something on console. What ever printed is definitely inside System.out.println(). But I am unable to track that SOP. I also searched that piece of value through search tool in eclipse. But I couldn't find it. Is there any way to do that in debug mode, means can I add breakpoint to my whole project. Guide me. I am stuck.</p>
