<p>I am having a problem with debugging a DLL (C#). The DLL is running on a server and I'd like to debug it with the Remote Debugger Tool from Visual Studio 2010.</p>  <p>I actually can attach to the process, but somehow I always get the following problem at my breakpoint: "The breakpoint will not currently be hit. No symbols have been loaded for this document."</p>  <p>Edit: The .pdb is on the server too.</p>
