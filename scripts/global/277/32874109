<p>I've created an Eclipse plugin for internal use. I made some improvements to it recently that created a problem which has proven very difficulty to diagnose.</p>  <p>Everything works beautifully when running in the Eclipse debugger. But when installed from our internal plugin site, performing a certain action <em>completely</em> locks up Eclipse--so I can't check the error log and I'm not certain whether all log messages are being written to disk.</p>  <p>Does anyone have any thoughts on how I can diagnose the problem in this situation?</p>
