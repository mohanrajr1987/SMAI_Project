<p>I have a file as such:</p>  <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include &lt;string.h&gt; #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; #define DEBUG  int main(void) {  #ifdef DEBUG     printf("We are in debug mode"); #endif  } </code></pre>  <p>I was told to use ifdef and endif (for this). My problem occurs when I compile this, using a makefile(Which I'm not allowed to edit). What happens is the print statement (Debug one) prints, which shouldn't because I'm not in DEBUG mode. I tried to use this command (On Ubuntu 14.04)</p>  <p><code>make -DEBUG</code></p>  <p>But that did something completely different, and the output file, prints the ifdef statement, despite not being in DEBUG mode. What am I doing wrong?</p>
