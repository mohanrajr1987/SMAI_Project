<p>How can I</p>  <ol> <li>Set a breakpoint.</li> <li>Stop on Breakpoint.</li> <li>Release, but leave in debug mode. By release, I mean don't step to next line. Jump to next breakpoint. Or just wait until a breakpoint is hit  </li> </ol>  <p>I have no time or desire to go diving into the SDK classes. I just want out after I have stepped a through a few lines. So far the only thing I have been able to do is just kill the debug session.  Where is the "RELEASE" button to just move on? </p>  <p>I mean to me this is just obvious.  You don't want to step deeper and deeper into the code.  Once your done looking just resume into debug mode. Wait until you hit another break point.  How do I do this? Can it be done? And where is there no button for this?</p>  <p>Just resume, stay in debug mode. How do you do this?</p>
