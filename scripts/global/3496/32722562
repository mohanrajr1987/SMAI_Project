<p>this is first time i ask a question, so please be lenient :)</p>  <p>I think its very simple, i have a data.frame which consist of one Column "Time". It looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>------------------------- &gt; head(Times,10)    Times 1     NA 2  0.448 3  0.130 4     NA 5     NA 6  0.462 7  0.427 8  0.946 9  0.227 10    NA &gt; ------------------------ </code></pre>  <p>The idea is, that a first NA signals the starting of a sequence, hence, following times should be from the same label. After reaching the next NA entry , the sequence is finished.</p>  <p>I wanted now to create a new data.frame, which takes numbers between NA`s into a columns and seperate the sequences by rows. </p>  <pre><code>  Time1 Time2 Time3 Time4 1 0.448 0.130 0.123  2 0.462 0.427 0.946 0.227 &gt; --------------------------------- </code></pre>  <p>Can you help?</p>
