<p>At least on the surface of things, an out-of-the-box Python appears to be better suited for precise numerical calculations than PowerShell because of its unlimited <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#numeric-types-int-float-complex" rel="nofollow">integers</a></p>  <blockquote>   <p>Integers have unlimited precision.</p> </blockquote>  <p>and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html" rel="nofollow">decimals</a></p>  <blockquote>   <p>The decimal module has a user alterable precision (defaulting to 28   places) which can be as large as needed for a given problem.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Is that so, is standard Python more precise than PowerShell when wider numerical types are required?</p>  <p>Then Python has various packages, such as NumPy, which seem to make it a no contest.</p>  <p>Of course, PowerShell was probably never written to be a general purpose programming language, unlike Python, so I guess it does ok for what it is.</p>
