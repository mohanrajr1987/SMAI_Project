<p>I have multiple lines like this <code>&lt;VValue type="int" value="0" /&gt;</code> in files running in Sublime; each where the <code>value</code> increments <em>0, 1, 2, 3</em> etc...</p>  <p>I need to change these values, <code>+60</code>.  So, <em>0</em> would become <em>60</em>, <em>1</em> would be <em>61</em> etc.</p>  <p>How do I select the multiple lines and append them with regex in Sublime?  I'm not sure of the command to select the number itself... something like <code>\d+</code> was mentioned in another thread - <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15198845/sublime-text-2-increment-numbers">Sublime Text 2 increment numbers</a></p>  <p>Note, I skip one number to separate some content in the software the files run in, so it really needs to be a <code>+60</code> to the value command instead of just a direct replace all and increment (as in the thread above) as that would throw off the one that was skipped, if you follow me.  For example, it could be <em>0, 1, 3, 4, 5</em> that should equal <em>60, 61, 63, 64, 65</em> and not <em>60, 61, 62, 63, 64</em>. </p>  <p>Do I need something like TextPastry, and to use the Number Sequence Command?  If so, I'm not sure how that works and would appreciate comments.</p>  <p>Thanks for any help :)</p>  <p>Edit; I think I can use the Auto Step feature in <a href="https://github.com/duydao/Text-Pastry" rel="nofollow">Text Pastry</a>?  Can someone kindly run me through this how to... install and use.</p>
