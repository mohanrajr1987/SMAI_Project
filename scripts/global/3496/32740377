<p>I'm new into the programming stuff so i'm not sure how to write a program that will accept a series of numbers and will exit only if the user enters 0 then display how many numbers were entered before the user enters 0. </p>  <p>My code:</p>  <pre><code>import java.util.Scanner; class Sample {     public static void main(String[]args) {         Scanner x = new Scanner(System.in);         int y;         int count = 0;          System.out.print("Enter any number to continue. Enter 0 to stop.");         num = x.nextInt();         for(int n = 0; n&lt;=num; n++) { //is this for loop right?             y = x.nextInt();             count += y;         }         if(num == 0){             System.out.printf("You entered %d numbers,count");         }     } } // i know my code is missing alot.  </code></pre>  <p>Output Should be like this.</p>  <pre><code>Enter any number to continue. Enter 0 to stop  12 11 5 6 1 0 You entered 6 numbers. 2 even 3 odd // i know my code is far from what i want my output to be. EDIT : if the user enters 2 then 0 the output should be You Entered an even number // same with odd. how? </code></pre>
