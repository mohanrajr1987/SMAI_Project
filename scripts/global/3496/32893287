<p>I'm mostly a LaTeX writer, but am forced to use MS Word with a co-author for a book.  Each chapter will be written as a separate Word document. We're using MS Word 2010.</p>  <p>How can I somehow 'set' a Chapter number in a chapter and then have that used in the numbering of Figures and Tables, e.g., Figure 1-1 or Figure 1.1?</p>  <p>I have already searched this topic online, e.g., <a href="https://cybertext.wordpress.com/2014/03/31/word-change-caption-numbering-from-sequential-to-chapter-numbering/" rel="nofollow">https://cybertext.wordpress.com/2014/03/31/word-change-caption-numbering-from-sequential-to-chapter-numbering/</a>, but AFAICS, this applies to the numbering of chapters and other material <strong>within a single document</strong>.</p>  <p>We're using Heading 1 for chapter titles, but just manually typing these as "Chapter 2: The Age of Data".  Somehow, I think I have to create a multi-level list that I can use for the chapter numbers, but don't know how to.</p>  <p>At some point, the chapters will be combined, but it is far too difficult to do this in the early stages of writing.</p>
