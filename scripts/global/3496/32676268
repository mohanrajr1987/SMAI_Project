<p>Can any one help me sort out one problem, i have to reverse a number without using array(int/char) for storing them. </p>  <pre><code>input1 = 123 output1 = 321 input2 = 2300 output2 = 0032 </code></pre>  <p>I am trying to find the solution but 0 got erased while printing so i thought of octal conversion but still no solution, so i went with the decimal places and i made the 23 to 0.0032. Now my problem is how can i extract the 0032 from that part.</p>  <p>Is there any possible way to achieve this without using array(int/char), with that it will be easy.</p>
