<p>Need help getting populating array with random numbers <strong>1-10</strong> without using 0.  - Create an array of 100 integers. I've tried <code>int random = r.nextInt(High-Low) + Low</code>; but that throws off the count of how many of each number.</p>  <p>What I need to do in my assignment:</p>  <ul> <li>Populate the array with random numbers ranging from <strong>1 to 10</strong>. (not zero)</li> <li>Determine what the average is of all the numbers in the array.</li> <li>Count the occurrence of each of the ten numbers in the array of 100. Do by having a second array that's 10 integers in size and increment each element of the array based on the number of duplicates you find in your array of 100 integers.</li> </ul>  <p><br></p>  <pre><code>package arrays;  import java.util.Arrays; import java.util.Random;  public class Intergers {      public static void main(String[] args) {         // TODO Auto-generated method stub          Random r = new Random();          // Create an array of 100 integers.         int array[] = new int[100];          int a = 0;          // Populate the array with random numbers ranging from 1 to 10.         while (a &lt; 100)         {             int random = r.nextInt(10);             array[a] = random;             a++;         }          //calculate sum of all array elements         int sum = 0;           for(int i=0; i &lt; array.length ; i++)              sum = sum + array[i];          //calculate average value          double average = (double)sum/array.length;          System.out.println("Array: " + Arrays.toString(array));         // System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);          //System.out.println("Array Length: " + array.length);          System.out.println("Average value of array is: " + average);           // Count the occurrence of each of the ten numbers in the array of 100          int[] occurrences = new int[10];          for (int b : array) {                 occurrences[b]++;             }          // System.out.println("Array: " + Arrays.toString(occurrences));              System.out.println(1 + " appeared " + occurrences[0] + " times");           System.out.println(2 + " appeared " + occurrences[1] + " times");           System.out.println(3 + " appeared " + occurrences[2] + " times");           System.out.println(4 + " appeared " + occurrences[3] + " times");           System.out.println(5 + " appeared " + occurrences[4] + " times");           System.out.println(6 + " appeared " + occurrences[5] + " times");           System.out.println(7 + " appeared " + occurrences[6] + " times");           System.out.println(8 + " appeared " + occurrences[7] + " times");           System.out.println(9 + " appeared " + occurrences[8] + " times");           System.out.println(10 + " appeared " + occurrences[9] + " times");         } } </code></pre>
