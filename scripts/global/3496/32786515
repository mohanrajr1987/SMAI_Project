<p>I've read <a href="https://fr.wikibooks.org/wiki/Programmation_Python/Type#Les_nombres_.C3.A0_virgule_flottante_.28float.29" rel="nofollow">this page</a> (french) on which we can read float type in python would use a base-10 representation, instead of the classical binary (as in Java for example).</p>  <p>It seems so weird to me I'd like to be sure. Is this really true ? Doesn't Python use IEEE 754 ?</p>
