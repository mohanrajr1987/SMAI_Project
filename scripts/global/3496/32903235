<p>I'm working with a database that has call records in it and which stores the date and time for each call in two separate NUMBER fields. </p>  <p>I can't work out how the number stored in the fields relates to the date and time that's shown on the screen when viewing the record through the client app. I've tried all the usual Julian-related stuff, number of minutes/seconds since 1970, etc but don't seem to be able to figure it out.</p>  <p>For a date of 08/07/2015 and a time of 14:32:45, the two fields contain the following values:</p>  <ul> <li>date: 132056840</li> <li>time: 236989696</li> </ul>  <p>Can anyone shed any light on how to get from those numbers to the correct date/time?</p>  <p>Many thanks...</p>
