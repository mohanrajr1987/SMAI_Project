<p>Given two number a and b (1 &lt;= a &lt;= b &lt;= 10^6). Find most frequent digit among all prime numbers between a and b inclusive. if frequency is same print highest digit.</p>  <p>Example: from 1 to 20, prime numbers are - 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19. Here 2, 5, 9 occur only once, 3, 7 occur twice, and 1 occurs 5 times. So the result is 1.</p>  <p>One basic approach is:</p>  <ul> <li>In the range [a, b] - find all prime numbers. </li> <li>Take one count array to count occurrences from 0 to 9.  </li> <li>For all the prime numbers in the range, extract all the digits and        increment the count for the digits accordingly in the count array. </li> <li>Find out max from the count array.</li> </ul>  <p>But this is inefficient for a large range say [1, 1000000]. </p>  <p>Is there any efficient method to accomplish this?</p>
