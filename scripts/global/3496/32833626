<p>An <code>Armstrong number of three digits is an integer such that the sum of the cubes of its digits is equal to the number itself. For example, 371 is an Armstrong number since 3**3 + 7**3 + 1**3 = 371.</code></p>  <p>Here's the program from </p>  <p><a href="http://javaknowhow.blogspot.com/search?u" rel="nofollow">http://javaknowhow.blogspot.com/search?u</a>... </p>  <pre><code>import java.io.*; public class Armstrong {    public static void main(String args[])throws IOException    {        InputStreamReader read =new InputStreamReader(System.in);        BufferedReader in =new BufferedReader(read);        int n, num, a, b, c,s;          s=0;         System.out.println("Enter your no.");        n= Integer.parseInt(in.readLine());        num=n;        while(n&gt;0)        {            a=n/10;            b=a*10;            c=n-b;            s=s+c*c*c;            n=n/10;         }         if(num==s)           System.out.println("The number " +num+ " is an Armstrong no.");            else          System.out.println("The number " +num+ " is not an Armstrong no.");          } } </code></pre>  <p>Now if I input say 500 wouldn't  a be 50  b be 500  c be 0  and n be 50  but s isn't defined yet. </p>  <p>I don't understand how that would work. THe program doesn't seem correct. Please help. Thanks.</p>
