<p>I have written some code to ask the user for n, then print the prime numbers up to n. However when I use it, i.e with 10, it only prints the non-prime numbers</p>  <pre><code> /* Asks for the amount of prime numbers you would like to print, then prints them */  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;  int main(void) {     int n, i, j, check;     printf("How many prime numbers would you like to print? ");     scanf("%d", &amp;n);      for (i = 2; i &lt;= n; i++) {         check = 0;          for (j = 2; j &lt; i ; j++) {              if (i % j == 0) {                 check = 1;                               if (check == 1) {                     printf("%d\n", i);                 }             }         }     }             return 0; }  How many prime numbers would you like to print? 10 4 6 6 8 8 9 10 10 </code></pre>  <p>I've tried everything but I think I am missing something really trivial!</p>
