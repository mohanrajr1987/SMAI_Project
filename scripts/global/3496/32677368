<p>I've got this JSF APP, using postgresql 9.2, java7  and tomcat7</p>  <p>I developed the application under a windows7 64 bits (eng) enviroment. The application, will be running under a windows7 32 bits (pt_br).</p>  <p>The problem is... When I run the application under win32, the jsf converter seems not to work.</p>  <p>It gives me the following error: </p>  <pre><code>javax.el.ELException Caused by: javax.el.ELException: Error reading 'precoVenda' on type com.model.Produto Caused by: java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: "4,5" </code></pre>  <p>As far as I can imagine, it seems the jsf native converter is not doing it right.</p>  <p>Also, when I save something on my app in the win32, it converts my 4.5 to 4 One more thing i've noticed, is the inputText value: in win32 it shows comma: 4,0 While in the win64 it shows dots: 4.0</p>  <p>Anyone have any idea about what is going on?</p>
