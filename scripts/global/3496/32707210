<p>I'm doing an <a href="http://www.cs.ecu.edu/karl/3675/fall15/Assignments/Assn2/assn2.html" rel="nofollow">assignment</a> in Cinnameg that requires me to perform several operations on binary numbers (represented as lists) including one that will compare them and return a character such that compareInts(x, y) will return '>' if x > y, '&lt;' if x &lt; y, or '=' if x = y. What I am not completely sure about is how to make the comparison when it comes to binary numbers. I am not allowed to convert them to integers first (the whole point of the assignment is to be able to do arithmetic on integers that are too large to be stored normally). The only thing I can think of is that the number with the larger number of digits is probably larger, but that does not help if the two numbers have the same number of digits. Also if it matters we are only allowed to use the equational programming style of Cinnameg.</p>
