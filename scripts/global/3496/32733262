<p>Given a number, translate it to all possible combinations of corresponding letters. For example, if given the number <code>1234</code>, it should spit out <code>abcd</code>, <code>lcd</code>, and <code>awd</code> because the combinations of numbers corresponding to letters could be <code>1 2 3 4</code>, <code>12 3 4</code>, or <code>1 23 4</code>.</p>  <p>I was thinking of ways to do this in Python and I was honestly stumped. Any hints?</p>  <p>I basically only setup a simple system to convert single digit to letters so far.</p>
