<p>Hello stackOverflowers !</p>  <p>i was wondering if theres a way to get in a safe way, series of numbers in transactions just like the identity.My only purpose is for grouping rows  in tables and i don't mean row_number(). i've came up with this simple query, is this safe? this table has its own identity key</p>  <pre><code>declare @mynextSecuenceNumber int     select @mynextSecuenceNumber=isnull(max(secuencenumber+1),1) from mytable insert into mytable (productID,customer,secuencenumber) values (@someval,@anotherval,@mynextSecuenceNumber) </code></pre>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>  <p><strong>THE BACKGROUND</strong></p>  <p>the reason for doing this is the next:</p>  <p>first i'm recieving autoparts for car services then i generate a ticket for that recepcion(i can recieve one,two,three auto parts) later on i can continue on reciving autoparts for that specific car service from the same autopart provider or from a different provider but i want to be able to re generate the event or the ticket otherwise i'll end up querying the service and all the the autoparts associated with that or the provider and i wont know the event what i recived in that operation and on top of that i need another specific id for all those autoparts associated with that car service.</p>  <p>by the way i'm on sql server 2008</p>  <p><strong>heads up</strong></p>  <p>using identity as secuence number can be messy cus transactions will increment the value after rolling back and other <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14642013/why-are-there-gaps-in-my-identity-column-values">issues</a> so be aware of that thanks to the approach privided as my acepted answer i can find another way who gets along with transactions its the first to appear on the link</p>
