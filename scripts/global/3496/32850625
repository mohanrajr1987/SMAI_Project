<p>Thank you in advance for your valuable time and attention. </p>  <p>I am very new to batch scripting and have just been reverse engineering existing batches to learn more and get what i need. </p>  <p>Right now, I need to write a batch to insert the number "0" after the "5" in the string "12345678910"</p>  <p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. If at all possible, it would be of great help if one could explain each line and/or command so that I can understand how the script works. </p>  <p>Thank you again</p>  <p><strong><em>EDIT</em></strong></p>  <p>Perhaps i should be more specific as I am reading these other articles. I need the script to <strong>insert</strong> the number "0" after the "5" in the string "12345678910" inside of a text document. In other words, i need to find any instance of "12345678910" in a given text file and then add a "0" after the "5" in each instance. So I need to edit an existing text document</p>
