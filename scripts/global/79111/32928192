<p>I am trying to setup my mobile-config.js file such that for the iphone it is portrait only and for the ipad it is allowed to go in portrait or landscape. </p>  <p>But I can't figure it out, and there is very little information on how to do this. <a href="http://docs.meteor.com/#/full/App-info" rel="nofollow">http://docs.meteor.com/#/full/App-info</a></p>  <p>The meteor docs specify how to lock the orientation according the the operating system like iOS vs Android, but now how to customize the orientation based on device. </p>  <p>How can I do this?</p>
