<p>I'm having trouble delaying a function in Meteor that returns a message from a collection in the database. Right now, in the MeteorPad example link below, a message is posted from the user and it is displayed and faded in to everyone in the display. </p>  <p><a href="http://meteorpad.com/pad/32rHhkm6NmdxSsTt4/Copy%20of%20Test" rel="nofollow">MeteorPad Project Example</a></p>  <p><strong>JS</strong></p>  <pre><code>Template.textDisplay.helpers({ message: function () { return Database.findOne({}, { sort: { date: -1} });      } });   Database.insert({   text: message,   date: new Date() }); </code></pre>  <p><strong>HTML</strong></p>  <pre><code>&lt;template name="textDisplay"&gt;   &lt;div class="secret-display"&gt; {{secret.text}} &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/template&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Unfortunately if many people are sending a message at the same time the message can't be seen as there isn't enough time for the fade to finish.. it would need a 1 second delay between messages with some sort of queue.</p>  <p>I have tried setInterval for the delay which did not work in this case as a queue is needed. Is a queue of collections possible?</p>
