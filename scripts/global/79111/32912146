<p>I am attempting the Meteor/Angular2 tutorial <a href="https://github.com/ShMcK/Meteor-Angular2" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>  <p>If I make a change to a component the changes are not updated in the browser (Google Chrome); even if I do the following things...</p>  <ol> <li>Save changes and hard refresh browser.</li> <li>Stop server and restart.</li> </ol>  <p>I have to clear the browser cache to get rid of the old data and load the new.</p>  <p>I'm pretty sure this should not be the case, as it creates a major problem for a developer.</p>  <p>This tutorial is using Angular2, Meteorjs, as well as a typescript compiler.</p>  <p>This is not an Angular issue.</p>  <p>My question is... Is the problem with meteorjs not triggering a hard refresh? Or could it perhaps be an issue with the typescript compiler?</p>  <p>Also, how could I fix this?</p>  <p>I'm running</p>  <p>Typescript Compiler: netanelgilad:angular2-typescript</p>  <p>Meteorjs: 1.2.2</p>  <p>Google Chrome: Version 47.0.2525.0 canary (64-bit)</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>  <p>I tried a normal .js file and everything works as expected. This means its the Typescript Compiler: netanelgilad:angular2-typescript.</p>  <p>I'll check out the package and see what I can find.</p>
