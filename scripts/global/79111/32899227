<p>Basically trying to modify the user that was just created by giving it an extra field called <code>sid</code> in it's profile object. I'm running this on server.js (the server code)</p>  <pre><code>Accounts.onCreateUser(function (options, user) {               Meteor.users.update({_id: user._id}, {$set: {"user.profile.sid": [post.content]}}); });     console.log(JSON.stringify(user)); </code></pre>  <p>However, the user object does not show the <code>sid</code> field in it's output. Am I doing  this in the wrong location or is my code wrong?</p>
