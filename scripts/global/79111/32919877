<p>Morning everyone! </p>  <p>I have a design question that I haven't managed to find an answer to and maybe more knowledgeable people could give me some input. </p>  <p>I'm writing an app that requires small amounts of data from multiple sources. At the moment it's written with template level subscriptions, each one subscribing to data it needs (Each subscription returns about 20-25 small documents max)</p>  <p>Is this the most efficient way from a performance perspective? Or would one subscription returning all the necessary cursors at once work better?</p>  <p>Thank you</p>
