<p>I am using an <code>observeChanges</code> on this cursor as follows. The cursor contains a nested array called "messages".</p>  <pre><code>Connections.find({   status: 'connected' }).observeChanges({   added: function (id) {     console.log(`Connected ${id}`);   },   changed: function (id, fields) {     // I expect fields to be the last array item pushed     console.log(fields['messages']);   } }); </code></pre>  <p>However, this yields all the messages, rather than the ones changed or added. How can you just get the last ones pushed? Getting the <em>last</em> one won't work as intended because you can push multiple at a time.</p>  <p><a href="http://meteorpad.com/pad/fyAepn2FYojHKhBjL/Leaderboard" rel="nofollow">Here is a fully working example on meteorpad if you want to see what I mean in action (look at console.logs)</a></p>
