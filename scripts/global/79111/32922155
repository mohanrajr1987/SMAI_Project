<p>I've been using 1.1 on Win 10. When 1.2 came out, I tried upgrading but it actually falled back to 0.3. According to sashko a reinstall was necessary, which solved the problem for some. However, nothing happened when I uninstalled and rerun the installer. No files were actually modified. Deleting the %localappdata%/.meteor folder didn't help either. As the installer would no longer put anything there.</p>  <p>The farthest I could get is to get a dev build with a git clone, but I'd like to use a release version either 1.1 or 1.2. Otherwise I'm not able to update my project with a checkout meteor build.</p>  <p>Wrote a bunch of comments on other threads but none of the suggestions helped thus far, so I thought this deserves a new separate thread.</p>
