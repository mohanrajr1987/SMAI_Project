<p>I have a running Meteor project and wanted to test, if it scales. So in fact I have to save data in a collection where one document uses round about 500 KB. At 682 entries (documents) in this collection Meteor exits with code 3.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/u9CBI.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/u9CBI.png" alt="This is how it looks like in console."></a></p>  <p>I heard about a maximum of 32MB data, why is that? How can I get more space? Will more space have impacts on efficiency? I need about 10000 entries of 500 KB. Is that even possible? Would appreciate answers and also solutions (like maybe outsource mongodb?).</p>
