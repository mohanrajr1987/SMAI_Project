<p>We're having real problems trying to get spiderable to return body content from a meteor app deployed behind nginx on ec2. When we do:</p>  <pre><code>$ curl https://host/?_escaped_fragment_= </code></pre>  <p>(Note the SSL)</p>  <p>We always get an <code>internal server error</code>. Getting a page without the <code>?_escaped_frament</code> returns a page with full headers but an empty body. (Reminds me of <em>Big Head</em> on HBO's Silicon Valley)</p>  <p>Subscriptions are properly handled with <code>this.ready()</code> in <code>iron-router</code> as many have recommended. That's not the problem. Relevant packages include:</p>  <ul> <li><code>jazeee:spiderable-longer-timeout</code></li> <li><code>spiderable</code></li> <li><code>gadicohen:phantomjs</code></li> </ul>  <p>A gaggle of googling has yielded suggestions to use various forks of spiderable along with some opaque suggestions on configuring nginx. Can you recommend a <em>working</em> configuration of packages and nginx configuration? Bonus points for explaining <em>why</em> it works.</p>
