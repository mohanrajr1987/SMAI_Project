<p>Installed and configured <code>accounts-ui</code> and <code>accounts-facebook</code> modules. When I click on the login button for Facebook, I get an error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>W20151003-14:05:14.378(-4) (oauth_server.js:398) Error in OAuth   Server: Failed to fetch identity from Facebook. failed [400]   {"error":{"message":"API calls from the server require an   appsecret_proof   argument","type":"GraphMethodException","code":100,"fbtrace_id":"EXb0O+KXbNg"}}   I20151003-14:05:14.575(-4)?

When disabled, this works just fine. How can I make this work? I'm also confused by the fact that this is supposed to be a client-side operation. Any insight will be appreciated.</p>
