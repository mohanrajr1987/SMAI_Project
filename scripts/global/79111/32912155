<p>How can I react to just the URL's hash changing with Iron Router?</p>  <p>I've reimplemented the <code>action</code> method in a custom <a href="http://iron-meteor.github.io/iron-router/#route-controllers" rel="nofollow">route controller</a>, in order to control page rendering, however this hook doesn't get invoked if only the URL's hash changes (f.ex. due to the user clicking a link with <code>href="#about"</code>). The relevant part of my controller looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>@UserController = RouteController.extend({   action: -&gt;     tabName = @params.hash     @state.set("activeTab", tabName)     @render("user") }) </code></pre>  <p>So, basically I need the <code>action</code> method to get called whenever the URL hash changes.</p>
