<p>I'm creating an order form and a schema defined for an Order (certain required fields such as address, customer info, items selected and their quantities, etc).</p>  <p>a. User visits site.</p>  <p>b. A unique ID is generated for their session as well as a timestamp.</p>  <pre><code>var userSession = {   _id: createId(),   timestamp: new Date(), };  var sessionId = userSession._id; </code></pre>  <p>c. The <code>userSession</code> is placed in local storage.</p>  <pre><code>storeInLocalStorage('blahblah', sessionObject); </code></pre>  <p>d. An Order object is created with the sessionId as the only field so far.</p>  <pre><code>var newOrder = {   sessionId: sessionId; }; </code></pre>  <p>e. Obviously at this point the Order object won't validate according to the schema so I can't store it in Mongo. BUT I still want to store it in Mongo so I can later retrieve incomplete orders, or orders in progress, using the sessionID generated on the user's initial visit.</p>  <p>This won't work because it fails validation:</p>  <pre><code>Orders.insert(newOrder); </code></pre>  <p>f. When a user revisits the site I want to be able to get the incomplete order from Mongo and resume:</p>  <pre><code>var sessionId = getLocalStorage('blahblah')._id; var incompleteOrder = Orders.findOne({'sessionId', sessionId}); </code></pre>  <p>So I'm not sure how to go about doing this while accomplishing these points.</p>  <ul> <li><p>I want full <code>simpleschema</code> validation on the <code>Orders</code> collection when the user is entering in items on the forms and when the user is intending to submit a full, complete order.</p></li> <li><p>I want to disable <code>simpleschema</code> validation on the <code>Orders</code> collection and still allow storing into the DB so that partial orders can be stored for resumption at a later time.</p></li> </ul>  <p>I can make a field conditionally required using <a href="https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-simple-schema#make-a-field-conditionally-required" rel="nofollow">this here</a> but that would mean 50+ fields would be conditionally required just for this scenario and that seems super cumbersome.</p>
