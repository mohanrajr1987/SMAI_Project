<p>I'm testing out some old code and I'm getting an error and it looks like its with these lines of code:</p>  <pre><code>var targetFile='../../../../../public/image1.png'; var sourceFile='../../../../../../game4-dirs/public/image2.png';  fs.writeFileSync(targetFile, fs.readFileSync(sourceFile)); </code></pre>  <p>The error I'm getting is:</p>  <pre><code>Error: ENOENT, unlink '../../../../../public/image1.png' </code></pre>  <p>I seem to vaguely remember that <code>public</code> and <code>game4-dirs</code> aren't  accessible like this relatively to the product but relatively to where meteor is installed to (or something like that, I can't quite remember).</p>  <p>Has this change in version 1.2.0.2?  I was originally using v0.9.3.1</p>  <p>Thank you :)</p>
