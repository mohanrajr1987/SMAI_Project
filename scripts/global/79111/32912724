<p>I have a ReactiveVar that I need to read from and modify inside of an initialized jQuery plugin. Unfortunately I can't find a way to call my template's context inside of the jQuery event callbacks. This is all client side. I can't use a Session here. Here is some code:</p>  <p><strong>Setup my var</strong></p>  <pre><code>Template.player.onCreated(function(){    this.isPlaying = new ReactiveVar;    this.isPlaying.set('false'); }) </code></pre>  <p><strong>Init my jQuery plugin</strong></p>  <pre><code>Template.player.onRendered(function() {     initPlayer() }); </code></pre>  <p><strong>relevant portion of initPlayer():</strong></p>  <pre><code>master = new TimelineMax({     paused: true }); master.eventCallback("onUpdate", function() {         //Template.instance().isPlaying.set(false) //can't do this here         //reactive variables in jquery events are out of scope?     } }); </code></pre>  <p>I have tried running the init function in an autotracker without any luck. I know I could use a Session here but I really want a reactive variable that will be destroyed along with the template. Any ideas of how to model this?</p>
