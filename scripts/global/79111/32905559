<p>I'm planning to develop PHP eCommerce application with MySQl database as a backend. I'm planning to develop Mobile application for this application.</p>  <p>Which technology should I use so that I can create Business logic (Business Layer) and Data Logic (Data Layer) at once and keep reusing the same across all the platforms (Windows/Web/Mobile/Mac/Linux/etc). I don't want to recreate the same logic again and again. I'm planning to create native apps for Android,Windows,IOS platforms and connect to common database. I welcome all valuable suggestions. And also please suggest whether can I use Web Service or RESTFull Web Service or Meteor.js or Express.js for this scenario.</p>  <p>Thanks in Advance.Waiting for valuable reply.</p>
