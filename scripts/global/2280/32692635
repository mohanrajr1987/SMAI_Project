<p>I'm developing an apk for android (java, ionic, angular JS,...) running over a development board (UDOO QUAD) but I'm having problems of performance when scrolling screens with high quality images or data updated in "real time".</p>  <p>I suspect that my problem is that my apk is running from SD card which is a slow device. So I have to major questions, the first one is for my personal knowledge and the second one is the main question of this post.</p>  <p>1.- When an APK is started, how does it work, is all the apk copied to RAM, what are the timings?</p>  <p>2.- I've search all around internet for a method for copying at apk start all the data to RAM for increase performance, but I haven't found a procedure to do this.</p>  <p>Does anybody know a way to do this? </p>  <p>Thanks, Guillermo</p>
