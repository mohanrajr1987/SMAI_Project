<p>I have built a linux image for ARM on Ubuntu. I was curious to use the file command on the image file created in arch/arm/boot directory. When i execute the following the command </p>  <pre><code>balaji@balaji-virtual-machine:~/meraj/linux-stable/arch/arm/boot$ ls bootp  compressed  dts  Image  install.sh  Makefile  zImage balaji@balaji-virtual-machine:~/meraj/linux-stable/arch/arm/boot$ file Image Image: data balaji@balaji-virtual-machine:~/meraj/linux-stable/arch/arm/boot$ file zImage zImage: data balaji@balaji-virtual-machine:~/meraj/linux-stable/arch/arm/boot$ </code></pre>  <p>It gives not much information. I would like to know if this is expected behaviour or not?</p>
