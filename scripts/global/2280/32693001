<p>i try to port a little kernel to a new platform, with ARM Cortex A9. Unfortunately, the kernel crashes pretty early.</p>  <p>I boot with U-Boot, but all i get as output is:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>## Starting application at 0x01000000 ...</p>      <p>## Application terminated, rc = 0x1</p> </blockquote>  <p>Looking at the early boot-up code, my guess is that i run into some rough termination with 'b  .' . For example:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>cmp  r0, r1</p>      <p>beq  _config</p>      <p>b . /* TODO: reset? log? */</p> </blockquote>  <p>My guess is, that this causes U-Boot to terminate with rc=0x1.</p>  <p>Is this possible?</p>  <p>Now, for debugging purpose i would like to change the line 'b .' to something that makes u-boot return another value (maybe 0x0).</p>  <p>But which assembler code could i use for that?</p>
