<p>Board: FRDM-KL46Z<br> Red generic LED<br> 820ohm resistor (which is the correct resistor for this LED)<br> Breadboard used to connect from port pin 1 of j4 io header (io header pin 4) to LED in series with one resistor and terminating in ground.  </p>  <p>I am attempting to execute some test code to light up an LED/resistor in series. I was given this generic test code to start but there seems to be something missing.</p>  <pre><code>int main() {  SIM_BASE_PTR-&gt;SCGC5 = 1 &lt;&lt; SIM_SCGC5_PORTB_SHIFT; PORTB_PCR1 |= PORT_PCR_MUX(0b001); PTB_BASE_PTR-&gt;PDDR |= 1 &lt;&lt; 1; PTB_BASE_PTR-&gt;PDOR |= 1 &lt;&lt; 1;  return 0; } </code></pre>  <p>Regardless of the LED configuration, I am not getting any voltage out of the pin when checking it with a digital multi-meter.</p>
