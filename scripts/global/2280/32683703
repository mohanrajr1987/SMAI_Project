<p>I'm trying to use Jenkins to create my own Arch Linux repository from AUR packages, which I need built for both x86 machines and Raspberry Pis.</p>  <p>I've created a multi-configuration job to build a package and set up an x86 box and three pis as build slaves, as well as a repo server that's configured to accept package files over ssh with key auth. On Jenkins, I'm using the 'Copy Files over SSH' post-build action, which works perfectly fine from the x86 slave. On all three of the raspberry pi slaves, however, that step hangs for several minutes, and then produces this error:</p>  <pre><code>SSH: Connecting from host [spike] SSH: Connecting with configuration [repo.example.net] ... ERROR: Exception when publishing, exception message [Failed to connect session for config [repo.example.net]. Message [Auth fail]] Finished: UNSTABLE </code></pre>  <p>I can login successfully using the key file when copied to all four slaves, and using the 'Test Configuration' button in Jenkins' configuration page reports that it works correctly.</p>  <p>Interestingly, the SSH server on the target machine does not report anything at all when the pi slaves attempt to login.</p>
