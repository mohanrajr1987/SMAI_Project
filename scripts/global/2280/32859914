<p>I'm very new to arm assembly and I'm using armsim for a school project. I have multiple problems.</p>  <ol> <li>I need to read multiple lines from a txtfile and each line has a string that will take up to 85 bytes(per line). My program only reads the first line, I don't know how to read the rest of the file.</li> <li>I have to take each character from each line and add 13 if the character value i'll call "a" ((a>=65 &amp;&amp; a&lt;=77) || (a>=97 &amp;&amp; a&lt;=109)). I have to subtract 13 if ((a>=78 &amp;&amp; a&lt;=109)||(a>=110 &amp;&amp; a&lt;=122)). If (a==32) then I print out the space and move onto the next character.I don't understand how to do this using branches...</li> </ol>  <p>The loop processes character by character and prints the character out into stdout. Here is my code so far... I've spent days &amp; hours on this and I just can't wrap my head around this. I have only been exposed to java up till now.</p>  <pre><code>.equ SWI_Open, 0x66 @open a file .equ SWI_Close,0x68 @close a file .equ SWI_PrChr,0x00 @ Write an ASCII char to Stdout .equ SWI_PrStr, 0x69 @ Write a null-ending string .equ SWI_PrInt,0x6b @ Write an Integer .equ SWI_RdInt,0x6c @ Read an Integer from a file .equ SWI_RdStr, 0x6a @ Read string from file .equ Stdout, 1 @ Set output target to be Stdout .equ SWI_Exit, 0x11 @ Stop execution .global _start .text _start:  ldr r0,=InFileName @ set Name for input file mov r1,#0 @ mode is input swi SWI_Open @ open file for input ldr r1,=InFileHandle str r0,[r1] ldr r7,[r1] ldr r1,=array mov r2,#85 swi SWI_RdStr @stores the string into =array   mov r5,#0 @r5 is index  loop: @processes a single char then loops back cmp r5,r2 @r2 is 83 bge procstop ldrb r4,[r1,r5] @loads the character value from =array[r5] into r4  cmp r4,#77 ble add cmp r4,#65 bge add  cmp r4,#97 bge add cmp r4,#109  ble add  cmp r4,#78 bge sub cmp r4,#90 ble sub  cmp r4,#110 bge sub cmp r4,#122 ble sub  add: add r4,r4,#13  sub: sub r4,r4,#13  mov r0,r4 swi SWI_PrChr  strb r4,[r1,r5] add r5,r5,#1 B loop procstop:  mov r0,#Stdout swi SWI_PrStr swi SWI_Exit  .data InFileName: .asciz "lab4.txt" EndOfFileMsg: .asciz "End of file reached\n" ColonSpace: .asciz": " NL: .asciz "\n " @ new line array: .skip 85 .align InFileHandle: .word 0   .end </code></pre>
