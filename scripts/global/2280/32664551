<p>I am using arm-linux-gnueabihf-g++-4.8 on an amd64 machine to cross compile boost targeting ARM 32-bit architecture. My OS is Ubuntu 14.04.</p>  <p>It fails to build lib libboost_iostreams because libbz2 does not comes with the compiler. Following is the error detail,</p>  <p>/usr/lib/gcc-cross/arm-linux-gnueabihf/4.8/../../../../arm-linux-gnueabihf/bin/ld: cannot find -lbz2 collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status.</p>  <p>Having a hard time figure out how to install this libbz2 for arm-linux-gnueabihf-g++-4.8. Did not find much document online. Need some help. Thank you very much!</p>
