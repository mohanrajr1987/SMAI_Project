<p>I'm having troubles understanding what those code means in assembly language. <strong>Assume r3 = 0x4000 r4 = 0x20 want to get the effective address..</strong>.</p>  <pre><code>STRH r9, [r3, r4]; 0x00004020 LDRB r8, [r3, r4, LSL #3];0x00024000 (**?**) LDR r7, [r3], r4;**?** STRB r6, [r3], r4 , ASR #2; </code></pre>  <p>From what I know, LSL #3 should shift the bit to left for 3 bits, so does that mean 0x20 will become 0x20000 ? Also the other one I don't seem to understand the logic very well. Can someone maybe give me some guides or a a little walk through? Thanks.</p>
