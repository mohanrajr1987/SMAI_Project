<p>I'm developing Linux kernel module for my Cubieboard2, kernel version 3.4.79. And i need to access peripherals configuration registers. I know how to do it from user space, but don't know about kernel space.</p>  <p>Also could you tell me what is better to drive GPIO with special functions like gpio_get_value() or gpio_set_value(), or do it through the configuration registers? What will be faster? And what if i need to drive array of GPIO as a port?</p>
