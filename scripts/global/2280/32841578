<p>I moved from XCode 6 to XCode 7 and without any changes to the source, or project, or anything my Archive builds started to fail.</p>  <p>After research on the error that <code>lipo</code> produced:</p>  <pre><code>lipo:.../Release-iphoneos/libSDWebImage.a and .../Release-iphonesimulator/libSDWebImage.a have the same architectures (i386) and can't be in the same fat output file </code></pre>  <p>I found that the following:</p>  <p>In XCode 6 the <code>lipo -info</code> returns <code>Architectures in the fat file: .../Release-iphoneos/libSDWebImage.a are: armv7 arm64</code> and <code>Architectures in the fat file: .../Release-iphonesimulator/libSDWebImage.a are: i386 x86_64</code> which is correct. I have arm for iphone device and i386 for iphone simulator. </p>  <p>In XCode 7 these two files are the same, and have the i386 architecture! So framework scripts that uses lipo to join these two <code>.a</code> files into one fails.</p>  <p>Why XCode 7 suddenly stopped building my <code>SDWebImage</code> framework for arm? The project settings are unchanged, the library is the same, the scheme has Archive set to Release. Please help.</p>  <pre><code>iMac:~ lukasz$ lipo -info /Users/lukasz/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/…-etcsjmgakpylpmgchumhnsqpyrev/Build/Intermediates/ArchiveIntermediates/adhoc-stage/BuildProductsPath/Release-iphoneos/libSDWebImage.a input file /Users/lukasz/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/…-etcsjmgakpylpmgchumhnsqpyrev/Build/Intermediates/ArchiveIntermediates/adhoc-stage/BuildProductsPath/Release-iphoneos/libSDWebImage.a is not a fat file Non-fat file: /Users/lukasz/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/…-etcsjmgakpylpmgchumhnsqpyrev/Build/Intermediates/ArchiveIntermediates/adhoc-stage/BuildProductsPath/Release-iphoneos/libSDWebImage.a is architecture: i386  iMac:~ lukasz$ lipo -info /Users/lukasz/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/…-etcsjmgakpylpmgchumhnsqpyrev/Build/Intermediates/ArchiveIntermediates/adhoc-stage/BuildProductsPath/Release-iphonesimulator/libSDWebImage.a input file /Users/lukasz/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/…-etcsjmgakpylpmgchumhnsqpyrev/Build/Intermediates/ArchiveIntermediates/adhoc-stage/BuildProductsPath/Release-iphonesimulator/libSDWebImage.a is not a fat file Non-fat file: /Users/lukasz/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/…-etcsjmgakpylpmgchumhnsqpyrev/Build/Intermediates/ArchiveIntermediates/adhoc-stage/BuildProductsPath/Release-iphonesimulator/libSDWebImage.a is architecture: i386 </code></pre>
