<p>I am currently trying to compile Hadoop 2.7.1 on a Raspberry Pi running Raspbian 7 (wheezy) to get the native libraries going. I got most of the dependencies working, but I get the following error from Maven:</p>  <pre><code>[INFO] [INFO] --- maven-antrun-plugin:1.7:run (make) @ hadoop-common --- [INFO] Executing tasks  main:  [exec] -- The C compiler identification is GNU 4.6.3  [exec] -- The CXX compiler identification is GNU 4.6.3  [exec] -- Check for working C compiler: /usr/bin/gcc  [exec] -- Check for working C compiler: /usr/bin/gcc -- works  [exec] -- Detecting C compiler ABI info  [exec] -- Detecting C compiler ABI info - done  [exec] -- Check for working CXX compiler: /usr/bin/c++  [exec] -- Check for working CXX compiler: /usr/bin/c++ -- works  [exec] -- Detecting CXX compiler ABI info  [exec] -- Detecting CXX compiler ABI info - done  [exec] Soft-float JVM detected  [exec] -- Looking for exit  [exec] CMake Error at JNIFlags.cmake:59 (message):  [exec]   Soft-float dev libraries required (e.g.  'apt-get install libc6-dev-armel'  [exec]   on Debian/Ubuntu)  [exec] Call Stack (most recent call first):  [exec]   CMakeLists.txt:24 (include)  [exec]  [exec]  [exec] -- Looking for exit - not found.  [exec] -- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred! </code></pre>  <p>Obviously it is not as simple as doing the apt-get install libc6-dev-armel that is suggested. This package is not available. However I am unsure as how to proceed. Does anyone have a suggestion?</p>
