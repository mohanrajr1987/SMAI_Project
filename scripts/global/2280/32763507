<p>I'm expanding circuit emulation engine for Win32 and want to add arm core support and integrate with systemC.<br> I need some library that allows me to load binary file and execute it step by step. It shouldn't use any kernel drivers or hypervisor.<br> The execution speed doesn't matter as it mostly will run step by step.<br> back in the days there was a libqemu that allowed it. Moreover GDB support made it even better. But now it looks like it can work only as standalone emulator.  May be there are better way? I hope I posted it in the right forum</p>
