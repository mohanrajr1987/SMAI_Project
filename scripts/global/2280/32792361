<p>I am supposed to create a program with the ".dat" extension, but ARMSim# doesn't read the file. First off, how am I supposed to have it read my file?</p>  <p>Also, the program I am writing needs to let the user input a list of numbers and the output should be the first integer, second integer, total number of integers, total numbers that are not the first integer, and total numbers that are not the second integer. </p>  <p>On top of it, it needs to check for errors and have a readable output.</p>  <p>I am completely stuck and obviously don't know any ARM. I would like to learn it since I will be having future projects that I hopefully will be able to do on my own, so if you can describe any code that would be great. The whole week I have been trying to read websites on ARM and I still stare blankly at the screen when I try to code anything. Any help would be GREAT.</p>
