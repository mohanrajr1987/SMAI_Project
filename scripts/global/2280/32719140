<p>I created some plugin files in C++ for my Unity3d app. So far the app was just a simple protype, so I tested only on my desktop with libraries compiled as DLL for Windows. Today I recompiled those files as .so(Shared Object) for Android(both arm and x86) and got a warning message.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>warning : calling convention '__stdcall' ignored for this target   [-Wignored-attributes]</p> </blockquote>  <p><strong>1. This means all functions are compiled as __cdecl?</strong></p>  <p><strong>2. Can't I specify the calling convention in .so library?</strong></p>  <p>I replaced __stdcall with __cdecl, but it also occurs a warning message.</p>
