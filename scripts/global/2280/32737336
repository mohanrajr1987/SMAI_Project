<p>I am new to ARM processors. Atmel ATSAMD20e implements ARM cortex M0+ processor based on ARMv6 architecture. It allows upto 32 external interrupts, with the interrupt signals connected to the nested vector interrupt table (NVIC). Would it be possible to have concurrent interrupts using NVIC? if so,how can we determine the maximum number of interrupts that can be run concurrently? Could someone please point to any documentation that explains handling of concurrent interrupts. Thanks</p>
