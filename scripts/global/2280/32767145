<p>I'm trying to write an ARM Assembly program that opens and reads integers from a file. I am extremely new to ARM and do not think I fully understand whats going on here, any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>  <p>Here's what I have so far:</p>  <pre><code> @ ========= Open file for reading =============================  ldr r0,=inputFile          mov r1,#0         swi 0x6c          @ open file  bcs InFileError       @ if cannot open file branch to InFileError   ldr r1,=InputFileHandle  str r0,[r1]   inputFile: .asciz "integers.dat"  InputFileHandle: .word 0   InFileError:  ldr r1, =FileOpenErrorMsg  swi 0x02 @ display error  bal Exit   FileOpenErrorMsg: .asciz "Error opening file."   Exit:  swi 0x68   @ close file  </code></pre>  <p>This is what I get when I try to run in ARMSim#:</p>  <pre><code>PC Out of valid memory range, address 00011400  R0 :4140 R1 :4172 ... (all 0) R8 :37484 ... R13 :21504 R15 :70656 </code></pre>
