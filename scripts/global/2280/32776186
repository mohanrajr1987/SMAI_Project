<p>I'm trying to read a string from a file and then add 15 to the ascii value of each character in the string and print out the string with value+15 in stdout. I'm a complete beginner with this so I'm not entirely sure what I'm doing, I've looked around for hours. I have a couple questions about this code that I'll put as comments next to the line of code. The file only has a string "the log cabin is red". I'm only confident in the code up to ldr r6,=array and am completely unsure of what I'm doing after that. </p>  <pre><code>.equ SWI_Open, 0x66 @open a file .equ SWI_Close,0x68 @close a file .equ SWI_PrChr,0x00 @ Write an ASCII char to Stdout .equ SWI_PrStr, 0x69 @ Write a null-ending string  .equ Stdout, 1 @ Set output target to be Stdout .equ SWI_Exit, 0x11 @ Stop execution .equ SWI_RdStr, 0x6a @ Read string from file .equ SWI_PrStr, 0x02 @print to Stdout  ldr r0,=InFileName mov r1,#0 @ sets input mode swi SWI_Open ldr r1,=InFileHandle @what is .word 0? is it a pointer for the file? str r0,[r1]  ldr r1,=array  mov r2,#85 swi SWI_RdStr  mov r5,#0 @r5 is index ldr r6,=array@only confident up to this point...  loop: cmp r5,r2 bge procstop ldrb r4,[r6,r5] add r4,r4,#13 add r5,r5,#1 B loop procstop:  mov r0,r4 mov r1,#Stdout swi SWI_PrStr swi SWI_Exit  .data InFileName: .asciz"whatever.txt" NL: .asciz"\n" InFileHandle: .word 0 array: .skip 85 </code></pre>
