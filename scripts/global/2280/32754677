<p>While understanding the device tree for Kernel(specific to ARM), I came to know that following difference before the device tree and after the device tree. </p>  <p>Before device tree :      R1 register contains machine type     R2 register contains pointer to ATAGS</p>  <p>With device tree:     No need to check the R1 register     R2 register contains pointer to dtb file.</p>  <p>My doubht here is what exactly R0 contains before device tree and any change in the R0 register usage with device tree.</p>
