<p>I'm trying to debug memory caches on the Altera cyclone 5 board, in particular on Terasic de0-nano-SoC. I'm using ARM DS-5 Ultimate Edition and the Linux kernel running on my board is Linux socfpga 3.13.0-00298-g3c7cbb9-dirty. The big issue is that I cannot see cache memories in the debugger! The Data cache view is empty and the cache list command returns No cache awareness for core "Cortex A9_0". Furthermore, the cache debug mode option is not present in the DTSL options. </p>  <p>I'm fairly sure that the caches (L1 and L2) are provided by the hardware. How can I resolve this??</p>  <p>Thanks. BR, M</p>
