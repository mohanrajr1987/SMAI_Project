<p>I am trying to establish real time communication between azure cloud and device like arm <a href="http://www.mbed.com/en/about-mbed/what-mbed/" rel="nofollow">mbed</a>. mbed is a C/C++ client. The data is in cloud which is continuous and received by couple of web api.</p>  <p>Based on few condition/data processing I need to send command to arm mbed device.  Currently device is requesting for information every few milliseconds to cloud and this is again handled by web api at cloud side. we can say it polling from device. This works fine but all the time device needs to check if some commands are available for it or not. </p>  <p>Is there a way to improve the scenario? i.e. whenever server is having command it directly pushes the data/command to the device. Can SignalR be used here?</p>
