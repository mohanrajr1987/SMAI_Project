<p>My question is: How do I pass the first_In_Line and last_In_Line variables out of the for-loop, so that my final statements receive the variables and display properly?</p>  <p>I'm making an assumption the students do not have the same name.</p>  <pre><code>// This program allows a user to define class size, between 1 and 25 // students, and give a list of names. It does not store a list  // of names, but does sort the names to determine alphabetically,  // which student will be first in line, and who will be last.  #include &lt;iostream&gt; #include &lt;string&gt;  using namespace std;  int main() { // Non-user defined variables int     num_Students = 0;  string  first_In_Line = "",         last_In_Line = "",         previous_Name = "";  bool compare = true;  // User defined variable. string  next_name;    // Get number of students from user between 1 and 25 cout &lt;&lt; "Please enter the number of students in class between 1 and 25: "; cin &gt;&gt; num_Students;  // Validate user input while (num_Students &lt; 1 || num_Students &gt; 25) {     cout &lt;&lt; "Please enter a number between 1 and 25.";     cin &gt;&gt; num_Students; }   for (int i = 1; i &lt;= num_Students; i++) {     cout &lt;&lt; "What is the name of student " &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; "? ";     cin &gt;&gt; next_name;      if (compare == true)     {         if (next_name &lt; previous_Name)         {         first_In_Line = next_name;         last_In_Line = previous_Name;         }          else if (next_name &gt; previous_Name)         {         first_In_Line = previous_Name;         last_In_Line = next_name;         }     }     // Set compare to "true" to execute if statements next      // iteration of for-loop     compare = true;     previous_Name = next_name; }  cout &lt;&lt; first_In_Line &lt;&lt; " is first in line." &lt;&lt; endl; cout &lt;&lt; "And " &lt;&lt; last_In_Line &lt;&lt; " is last in line." &lt;&lt; endl;   return 0; } </code></pre>  <p>Output is this, with the names not properly:</p>  <p>Please enter the number of students in class between 1 and 25: 3 What is the name of student 1? adam What is the name of student 2? matt What is the name of student 3? zed matt is first in line. And zed is last in line.</p>
