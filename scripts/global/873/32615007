<p>I am struggling trying to get a propositional formula of the following truth table: A, B, AC, BC. </p>  <p>For A and B it's easy: A xor B. However, when you insert a new literal C...</p>  <p>I tried using Wolfram by inputting the truth table (A &amp; ~B &amp; ~C) || (~A &amp; B &amp; ~C) || (A &amp; ~B &amp; C) || (~A &amp; B &amp; C). However, the suggested minimal forms are wrong since they do not consider C.</p>  <p>Can someone help expressing this in propositional logic using logical connectives like <strong>(A xor B) => C</strong>? Thanks!</p>
