<p>I have developed a friendship system, where users table have a friendship column. In this column, I store user's id in an array by separating with a coma. Example: 1,5,15,20</p>  <p>So it means, user is friend with other users, who has 1,5,15,20 as id. But there is another way to do this. Creating a friendship table and store everything there. Like in this examples:</p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25101089/mutual-friendship-rails-4">Mutual Friendship Rails 4</a></p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5612736/how-to-implement-a-friendship-model-in-rails-3-for-a-social-networking-applicati">How to Implement a Friendship Model in Rails 3 for a Social Networking Application?</a></p>  <p>My question is which way is the best way as efficiency and speed? Using an array column or separate table?</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
