<p>I'm trying to make <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=father%27s%20sister%27s%20grandfather&amp;dataset=&amp;equal=Submit" rel="nofollow">this</a> but for a different language. In this language there are different kinds of names for uncles and aunts. We call paternal aunt something else and maternal aunt something else.</p>  <p>I came across a graph database 'neo4j'. I created 5 members. I got this approach to work just like I want. But the problem in this is that I've to create <code>n * (n-1)</code> relationships. I'm create a full tree here and not just 5 members of a family. </p>  <p>Also, this is more like brute force. I'm creating all the possibilities.  <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/rMLrS.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/rMLrS.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I'm looking for a smarter way to do this. Creating rules like for example <code>Father's sister = paternal-aunt</code> and <code>Mother's sister = maternal-aunt</code> I also want queries <code>Father's wife's sister</code> but don't want to define them separately. </p>
