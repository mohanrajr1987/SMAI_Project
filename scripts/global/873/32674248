<p>I'm working with an exercise where I need to show that <code>KB |= ~D</code>. </p>  <p>And I know that the Knowledge Base is:</p>  <pre><code> - (B v ¬C) =&gt; ¬A  - (¬A v D) =&gt; B  - A ∧ C </code></pre>  <p>After converting to CNF:</p>  <pre><code>A ∧ C ∧ (¬A v ¬B) ∧ (¬A v C) ∧ (A v B) ∧ (B v ¬D) </code></pre>  <p>So now I have converted to CNF but from there, I don't know how to go any further. Would appreciate any help. Thanks!</p>
