<p>I'm trying to configure a volume discount system in a cell. I want to say:  </p>  <blockquote>   <p>If qty is 1, cost is $49.99; if qty is 2-3, cost is $49.50; if qty is 4+, cost is $48.99.</p> </blockquote>  <p>The furthest I've gotten is:  </p>  <pre><code>=OR((IF(I7&lt;2,49.99)),(IF(OR(I7&gt;1,I7&lt;4),49.5)))   </code></pre>  <p>in which <code>I7</code> is the cell containing qty. This returns <code>TRUE</code> which I understand is how the <code>OR</code> function works.</p>  <p>I'm just at a loss to how I can incorporate multiple outputs into a single cell given multiple potential conditions.</p>
