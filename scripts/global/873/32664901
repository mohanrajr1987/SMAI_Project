<p>I am making one logic, in one method I am getting time in milliseconds. I want to show it something like below:</p>  <pre> if time is b/w 1 minutes - 60 minutes, lets say 25 minutes it will show - 25 minute if time is 1 hour and 59 minutes it will show - 1h+ later if its 2 hour than it will show - 2h+ this will continue to 24 hour. later if its one day and few hours than it will show - 1d+ this will be continue till week and later on week, months and year like      1h+..... 1d,     1d+..... 1w,     1w+..... 1m,     1m+..... 1y, 1y+.. </pre>  <p>I cant use more if else. I need good performance with this method.  </p>
