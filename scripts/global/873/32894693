<p>first of all sorry for my poor english.</p>  <p>My problem is i have some object call Compartment ex:</p>  <pre><code>Compartment1 Capacity= 9000  QtyIn=0   Compartment2 Capacity= 5000  QtyIn=0   Compartment3 Capacity= 3500  QtyIn=0   Compartment4 Capacity= 2500  QtyIn=0  Compartment5 Capacity= 10000 QtyIn=0   </code></pre>  <p>each of them have a property called Capacity and a property called QtyIn.  Capacity is the maximum the compartment can hold and QtyIn its the quantity it is holding.</p>  <p>Lets say their value are set to the one up there. Now i have another variable ProductQty with a value of 16400. I have to fill the compartment with ProductQty,but a compartment with a QtyIn > 0 cant accept any product.Cant mix Product.</p>  <p>I'm looking for a way to fill the compartment with the most optimal way. I mean, how to find which combination of compartment will left me with the most free space and free compartment.</p>  <p>If i would do that with 16400, the best compartment would be Compartment1,Compartment2 and Compartment4. So Compartment3 and Compartment5 would be untouched and its the best combination with the most free space for a total of 13500.</p>  <p>Thank you all!</p>
