<p>How do you run a while loop if</p>  <pre><code>a=10  </code></pre>  <p>and </p>  <pre><code>b=100  </code></pre>  <p>and</p>  <pre><code>c=.1, </code></pre>  <p>where when 'a' and 'b' are more than 'c' apart, it will divide 'a' by 1.2 and 'b' by 2.2, so they change every time. This is what i have so far. But I know its wrong.... Thanks!</p>  <pre><code>a = 10; b = 100; c = .1; while (b-a)&gt;c a = a/1.2; b = b/2.2; end </code></pre>
