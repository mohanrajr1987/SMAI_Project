<p>I am trying to return the highest percentage value along with all the other information like name,average, percentage, color etc in the array.     </p>  <pre><code>foreach ($array as $value) {       $name = getName($value);     $average = getAverage($value);     $percentage = getPercentage($value);     $color = getColor($value);      return $percentage; } </code></pre>  <p>How can i implement the solution to find the desired value (highest percentage) and return it If an array. I am thinking sorting can be one way but i am still not clear how should i do it.</p>
