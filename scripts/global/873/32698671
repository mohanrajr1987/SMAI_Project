<p>You're scheduling meetings for an executive. He has 30min, 60min, and 90min meetings. How do you schedule it? Some of the variations are: schedule it so that he makes the most amount of meetings, 90min meetings are the highest priority, etc.</p>  <p>What data structure can I use in this?  I was thinking of very basic ideas like using an array with each entry being a half hour interval etc.</p>  <p>Thanks for the help.</p>
