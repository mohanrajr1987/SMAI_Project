<p>I just started using R and I am little confused. I don't have big practice in coding so sorry if my question is not adequate.  I learnt how to use FuzzyToolkitUoN and created FIS with two inputs and one output. However when I tried to define Three Inputs and One Output, I don't know how to define rules for three variables. There is very little amount of topics in internet regarding fuzzy toolbox. Hope someone in here can help.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
