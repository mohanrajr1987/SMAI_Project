<p>I'm using Unity but an answer in JavaScript especially or C# would help.<br> <br> I'm making a calculator using eval() and I need exponents using "^"<br> <br> I want to take<br> <br> 1+2^<br> <br> and replace "^" with ","<br> and insert "Mathf.Pow(" behind "2".<br> <strong>I need it to work even when "2" has more than one digit.</strong><br> It needs to become<br> <br> 1+Mathf.Pow(2, //Mathf.Pow is exponents using 2 parameters <br> Now, when user types "3", it becomes<br> <br> 1+Mathf.Pow(2,3<br> <br> I already know how to add ")" when user types a non-number.<br> <br> Thanks for the help! :)</p>
