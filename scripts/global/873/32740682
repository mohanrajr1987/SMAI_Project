<p>Let me clean this up a bit so people can understand better.</p>  <p>I'm reading into a text file and I'm wanting to print out numbers just once, even if they appear again later on in the list.</p>  <p>Example Text File:</p>  <pre><code> 100  200  300  200 </code></pre>  <p>Based on my logic, since 200 is in the text file twice, I only want to print it once. So my desired output would look like this using the example text file above.</p>  <pre><code> 100  200  300 </code></pre>  <p>Here is another example just to clarify (Text file is below)...</p>  <pre><code> 250A  300D  300D  300D  250A </code></pre>  <p>The designated output with the example above would be:</p>  <pre><code> 250A  300D </code></pre>
