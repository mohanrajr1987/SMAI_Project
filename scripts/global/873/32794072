<p>I have a web client - server application written on top of ordinal Web stack: PrimeFaces - JSF - JavaBean - ORM - JDBC - DBMS. Now I have faced whith a need of adding a business logic to the client side. The logic will be complex, and is not be covered by JavaScript; moreover it will contain  platform - dependent modules. It is also important (but not restricted) to keep existent web client access. So the questions are: how to rewrite the application with minimum efforts? Which technologies are the best for this situation?</p>  <p>The one idea is to add an embedded server (e.g. Jetty) to the client side (it preserves all the UI, backing beans, etc.) and make data synchronization between the "local" and "remote" servers. But I have no idea how to acheve this synchronization.</p>
