<p>Given this method:</p>  <pre><code>mergeSorted(struct ListNode * a, struct ListNode * b) {      struct ListNode * result = NULL;     if (a == NULL) return b;     if (b == NULL) return a;      if (a-&gt;data &lt;= b-&gt;data) {         result = a;         result-&gt;next = mergeSorted(a-&gt;next, b);     }     else {         result = b;         result-&gt;next = mergeSorted(a, b-&gt;next);     }      return result; } </code></pre>  <p>I understand how the list becomes sorted except for the first line where it sets the struct result to NULL. Each time the method is called recursively, how is the result list not set back to NULL? My first thought is that it is the pointer being set to NULL and not the actual contents of the list itself, but that still does not bring myself to a full understanding. I appreciate your help!</p>
