<p>I have a tree conflict in Content.json files in Image.xcassets while pulling the code from another branch. I have pretty much tried everything that I could find online but nothing helped. Apparently the conflict is in only 3 files but I am not sure which ones of all the Content.json files in the project.</p>  <p>I have also tried by adding the Image.xcassets in gitignore file. But still nothing helped. </p>  <p>I am a bit new to source code versioning, so please help.</p>
