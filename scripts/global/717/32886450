<p><em>Hi all,</em> I faced with a problem that Formula is not executed in merged entity. So I have Entity with one property marked with @Formula annotation. When I execute select of entity, the annotated property contains a proper value, but after merge returned persisted entity, the property is always null. Is it possible to trigger execution of the Formula after merge? Thanks in advance.</p>
