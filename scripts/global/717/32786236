<p>The <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/" rel="nofollow">git flow model</a> works really well for a lot of small developmental branches. However, it starts to slightly break down when there are a multiple branches that are super long features. For example, suppose 2 features (<code>feature_branch_a</code> and <code>feature_branch_b</code>) both take 3 engineering months to finish and you want to maintain them in sync with the <code>development</code>/<code>master</code> branch as well as with each other.</p>  <p>You could merge development/master into your feature branches every day. but what is a good practice for keeping <code>feature_branch_a</code> and <code>feature_branch_b</code>  in sync with each other? such that when you merge <code>feature_branch_a</code> back to <code>develop</code>/<code>master</code> that it doesn't screw over <code>feature_branch_b</code> massively in terms of merge conflicts?</p>
