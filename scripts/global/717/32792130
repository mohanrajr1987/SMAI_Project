<p>I am at my local branch and need to merge my changes to an <strong>remote</strong> tag or a commit. </p>  <p>I have tried <code>git merge &lt;commit-id&gt;</code> and <code>git merge &lt;tag-name&gt;</code> from my local but it keeps saying '<code>Already up-to-date</code>' but I know it's not. I also tried <code>git merge origin/&lt;commit-id&gt;</code> but it said <code>not something we can merge</code>. Am I missing something here? Thanks for the help</p>
