<p>Basically, I want to merge multiple lists in to a single list. All lists have same structure. Here is one example:</p>  <pre><code>file1=list(A=1,B=2) file2=list(A=2,B=3) file3=list(A=3,B=4) </code></pre>  <p>I know <code>mapply()</code> or <code>Map()</code> works.</p>  <pre><code>&gt; mapply(c, file1, file2, file3, SIMPLIFY=FALSE) [[1]] [1] 1 2 3  [[2]] [1] 2 3 4 </code></pre>  <p>But the problem is that I actually have 500 lists, well, I can sure copy and paste object names 500 times. However, I'd like to learn how to do it efficiently. I have a vector containing names of each 500 lists, like this, </p>  <pre><code>lsNames=c("file1","file2","file3") </code></pre>  <p>but I have to no idea how to start, I appreciate any help, thanks.</p>
