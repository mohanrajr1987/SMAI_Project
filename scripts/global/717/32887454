<p>I have this small presentation about algorithms with a group of nerds and i was randomly tasked to convince them that shell sort is better than merge sort algorithm... I have been reading for almost a weak But No matter how much i read on merge sort and shell sort i find the merge sort better than shell sort.. </p>  <p>Are their any advantages of shell sort on merge sort? I mean on what circumstances is shell sort better than merge sort. I might have missed something but i dont know what.</p>  <p>Any tips would be fine or if possible can you link me to something helpful..</p>
