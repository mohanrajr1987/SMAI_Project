<p>So I'm trying to complete a merge_sort for an array of strings, but I really have some troubles when it comes to C++. In the following code I'm trying to merge_sort an array of words that were scrambled by another program. However whenever I look up information on merge_sort all of them seem to have integers as arguments for their merge_sort, where as ours is using string **first, and string **last for its arguments. I need some help understanding how I get an array to split from these two string pointers instead of ints. Once I understand that, I feel confident in doing the rest.</p>  <p>The code:</p>  <pre><code>#include "Sorters.h"  void insertion_sort( string **first, string **last ) {     // If the sequence is empty there is nothing to do.     if( first == last ) return;      string **current = first;      // Advance current down the entire sequence.     ++current;     while( current != last ) {         // Set up two working pointers into the array.         string **p1 = current;         string **p2 = current - 1;          // Keep working as long as a swap is needed.         // Be careful not to go off the beginning of the array.         while( string_less( *p1, *p2 ) ) {             string *temp = *p1;             *p1 = *p2;             *p2 = temp;              if( p2 == first ) break;             --p1;             --p2;         }          ++current;     } }   void merge_sort( string **first, string **last ) {     if (first == last) {         return;     }     // IF &lt;the array is small enough to be sorted trivially&gt; THEN     //   &lt;do a trivial sort&gt;     // ELSE     //   &lt;split the array in half&gt;     //   &lt;merge_sort the two halves&gt;     //   &lt;merge the sorted halves together (write a separate function for this)&gt;     // END } </code></pre>  <p>Sorters.h :</p>  <pre><code>#ifndef SORTERS_H #define SORTERS_H  #include &lt;str.h&gt;  // Sorts an array of string* in O(n^2) time. void insertion_sort( string **first, string **last );  // Sorts an array of strigng* in O(n log(n)) time. void merge_sort( string **first, string **last );  #endif </code></pre>
