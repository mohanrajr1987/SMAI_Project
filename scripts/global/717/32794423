<p>I have a project that is up on GitHub.  Locally I am using Perforce and git p4 to push commits to GitHub.  I recently merged a pull request but I cannot for the life of me figure out how to merge it from my git repo into my Perforce workspace.  Obviously I could just grab the files from the git repo and move them by hand into my workspace, truthfully this project is very small and that wouldn't be an issue, but if I'm working on a larger project I'd like to know how to do this better.</p>  <p>My git repo is good to go with the merge, but after trying git p4 sync, submit, and commit, nothing is moving files from the repo to my workspace.  git p4 rebase seems to only go from the workspace to the repo, not the other way around.</p>  <p>Does anyone know the proper workflow for this?</p>
