<p>I am hard resetting one branch to another. After merging it with the <code>ours</code> strategy, I try to push through gerrit. I am getting an error like "missing change id". By default, the merge commit does not have a change id. I have tried to download the commit-msg hook for automatic change id. But it does not help in Windows. Any idea how to add change the id in a merge commit?</p>
