<p>I have two text files. One has the following list in it:</p>  <pre><code>dog cat horse </code></pre>  <p>The other has this:</p>  <pre><code>kennel flap shoes </code></pre>  <p>I want to merge these two text files into a new text file so that the terms are listed beside each other like so: </p>  <pre><code>dog kennel cat flap horse shoes </code></pre>  <p>How would I go about doing this? This is my code so far but it's largely incorrect:</p>  <pre><code>f1 = File.readlines('C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\Desktop\\hat.txt') f2 = File.readlines('C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\Desktop\\sat.txt')  File.open('file3.txt','w') do |output_file|      f1.zip(f2) do |a,b|         output_file.puts f1,f2     end  end </code></pre>
