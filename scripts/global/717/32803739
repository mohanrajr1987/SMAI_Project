<p>I have two dataframes:</p>  <pre><code>a.head()               AAPL             SPY       date 0  1000000.000000  1000000.000000 2010-01-04 1   921613.643818   969831.805642 2010-02-04 2   980649.393244  1000711.933790 2010-03-04 3   980649.393244  1000711.933790 2010-04-04 4  1232535.257461  1059090.504583 2010-05-04 </code></pre>  <p>and</p>  <pre><code>b.head()                   date           test 0 2010-01-26 22:17:44  990482.664854 1 2010-03-09 22:37:17  998565.699784 2 2010-03-12 02:11:23  989957.374785 3 2010-04-05 18:01:37  994315.860439 4 2010-04-06 11:06:50  987887.723816 </code></pre>  <p>After I set the index for <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> (<code>set_index('date')</code>), I can use the pandas <code>plot()</code> function to create a nice plot with the date as the x-axis and the various columns as y-values.  <strong>What I want to do is plot two dataframes with different indices on the same figure</strong>.  As you can see from <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, the indices are different, and I want to plot them on the same figure.</p>  <p>I tried <code>merge</code> and <code>concat</code> to join the dataframes together, but the resulting plot is not what I'd like because those functions insert <code>numpy.NaN</code> in places where the date is not the same, which makes discontinuities in my plots.  I can use <code>pd.fillna()</code> but this is not what I'd like, since I'd rather it just connect the points together rather than drop down to 0.</p>
