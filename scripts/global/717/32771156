<p>I have been working on a banch from trunk, I continously merged changes from trunk into my branch to ensure that I don't get away from the trunk with <code>svn merge ^/trunk/FW</code>. Now the time has come to merge my changes back into the trunk and I read on <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/svn.ref.svn.c.merge.html" rel="nofollow">http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/svn.ref.svn.c.merge.html</a> that there's a <code>--reintegrate</code> option which I can't find in my man page. So I'm wondering what that's for, how does it make the merge different and how do I best go about merging my changes back into the trunk?</p>  <p>What I have tried (using the <code>--reintegrate</code> option as described):</p>  <pre><code>$ svn merge --reintegrate ^/branches/Ron svn: Reintegrate can only be used if revisions 11797 through 12026 were previously merged from https://burnaby-svn01:8443/svn/NextGen/trunk/FW to the reintegrate source, but this is not the case:   branches/Ron/src/nms_core/jpax_system/jpax_time     Missing ranges: /trunk/FW/src/nms_core/jpax_system/jpax_time:11797-11810   branches/Ron/src/rtos_core/jpax_application     Missing ranges: /trunk/FW/src/rtos_core/jpax_application:11797-11810   branches/Ron/src/rtos_core/jpax_bsp_vip     Missing ranges: /trunk/FW/src/rtos_core/jpax_bsp_vip:11797-11810 </code></pre>  <p>Why does this not work properly?</p>
