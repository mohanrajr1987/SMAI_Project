<p>I'm familiar with ClearCase where we can merge a file to a branch from any other branch. How is this possible in git? For eg, I have the following structure</p>  <pre><code>master---&gt;branch_2   |   |   V branch_1 </code></pre>  <p>So there is some independent development going in <code>branch_1</code> and <code>branch_2</code>. I want to merge some specific code from <code>branch_2</code> to <code>branch_1</code> using some mergetool like kdiff3. </p>  <p>EDIT: Kdiff3 has an awesome merging option by comparing 2 or 3 versions of the file (from same or different branch), highlighting the conflicts. Then we can jump through each conflict, and pick the code from 1 or more versions of the file, make some edits (if necessary) and finally save the file. This feature has been quite handy for me when I worked with ClearCase. Is there a way to configure git mergetool with kdiff3 to work the same way? </p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
