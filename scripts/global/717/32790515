<p>I cloned some git repository and I have a patch file that I need to apply on one of the files in my working directory but it gives me a conflict.</p>  <p>The patch was prepared by someone else for some testing purposes apparently the needed file was updated on the server but I still need to patch the file locally</p>  <p>What is the best way to do the merge? Does there is a gui for it?(I use Ubuntu)</p>
