<p>Say I have hot and new news articles. I want to display them side by side in the view. It may of course be that there are more hot news than new news (at the morning for example) and vice versa. This would lead to an uneven length of the columns.</p>  <p>That's why I'm building two arrays. One with the hot news and one with the new ones.</p>  <pre><code>$hot = array(     'hotObj 1',     'hotObj 2',     'hotObj 3',     'hotObj 4', );  $new = array(     'newObj 1',     'newObj 2', ); </code></pre>  <p>What I want as a result is this:</p>  <pre><code>$hot = array(     'hotObj 1',     'newObj 1',     'hotObj 2',     'newObj 2',     'hotObj 3',     'hotObj 4', ); </code></pre>  <p>How can I achieve this? It shouldn't matter which array is longer.  array_merge() would just put the second array at the end which is not what I want.</p>
