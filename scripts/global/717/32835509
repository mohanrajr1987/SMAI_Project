<p>I am a total newbie to R and am trying to combine to <code>qplots</code> (<code>ggplot2</code> package) so that both of the graphs (Stress vs. Strain curves) will become one Stress vs. Strain graph. I have no idea how to do this. Would somebody please help. Below is the code for each individual plot. I have tried using <code>rbind</code> but I am not sure if that is relevant here.</p>  <pre><code>p1 &lt;- qplot(StrainL,StressL, data=dat2,) +        geom_line(aes(colour="Longitudinal")) p2 &lt;- qplot(StrainC,StressC, data=dat2) +        geom_line(aes(colour="Circumferential")) p3 &lt;- rbind(p1,p2) </code></pre>
