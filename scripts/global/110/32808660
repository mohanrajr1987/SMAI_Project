<p>I’ve recently started learning how to use Allegro 5 in C++ and I’m currently having trouble getting it set up in an Xcode project. I’ve gotten accustomed to the basics of Allegro 5 using Vim, but now I’d like to create a game to help strengthen my understanding of C++ &amp; to learn some game programming concepts.</p>  <p>I have looked online for guides on how to set Allegro 5 with Xcode but they all seem to use earlier versions of Xcode which I’ve tried to follow to no avail  (I’m not familiar with Xcode). Also, as I’m a self-taught programmer, I haven’t found any guides explaining the basics of IDEs on the internet* (e.g. what’s a build target? What’s a build phase?).</p>  <p>In vim, I’ve been using <code>g++</code> with the following code in a makefile to compile my Allegro 5 code:</p>  <pre><code>all: main.cpp ship.cpp     g++ -I/usr/local/include -I/Users/userName/Desktop/C/Asteroids/include -L/usr/local/lib -lallegro -lallegro_dialog -lallegro_image -lallegro_main -lallegro_primitives example.cpp -o example.exe </code></pre>  <p>Does anybody know of any good detailed guides on how to set up Allegro 5 on Xcode?</p>  <p>*I have used IntelliJ &amp; Pycharm before but I’m not familiar with all the different settings that an IDE has, especially when one needs to add 3rd party libraries to their project.</p>
