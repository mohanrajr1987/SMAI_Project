<p>I've been developing web applications in Eclipse and recently decided to give a shot to IntelliJ Idea. My webserver has about 15 artifacts and in Eclipse they were automatically assigned application context based on their names. Now in Idea it defaults them all to "/" which is obviously incorrect. Can I somehow set it to automatically define application context based on artifact name or do I have to enter them all manually? Sorry if that's a newbie question, I tried googling it and searching inside various settings for Idea but couldn't find the answer.</p>
