<p>I'd like to use PEP8 accepted format:</p>  <pre><code># Hanging indents should add a level. foo = long_function_name(     var_one, var_two,     var_three, var_four) </code></pre>  <p>How to configure PyDev so when I open bracket and press Enter it moves caret to next line with increased indentation by one level? Currently after hitting Enter caret is set just below openning bracket.</p>  <p>Is it configurable at all?</p>
