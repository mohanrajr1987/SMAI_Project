<p>I accidentally exited the <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/help/running-clion-ultimate-for-the-first-time.html" rel="nofollow">"complete installation"</a> section of CLion before I managed to finish. I got to this point:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ko9PV.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ko9PV.png" alt="CLion - configure MinGW/Cygwin, CMake and GDB"></a></p>  <p>When I got here, I realized that I hadn't installed g++ on Cygwin, so I paused to install g++. I also closed the <code>Customize CLion</code> window.</p>  <p>Now whenever I open CLion, it skips straight to the welcome menu:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/V240f.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/V240f.png" alt="CLion - Welcome Menu"></a></p>  <p>How can I get back and go through the <code>Customize Clion</code> as if I had just done so the first time?</p>  <p>Note that this is not specific to CLion, but applies at least to Intellij and likely most of Jetbrain's IDEs.</p>
