<p>I try to do the following refactoring steps in Eclipse IDE (JDT) and can nott find the required refactorings and can not remember the name of all of the steps. I checked the refactorings at <a href="https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring" rel="nofollow">SourceMacking</a> and do not find the correct one.</p>  <p>Here is what I want to do:</p>  <pre><code>class A {     method(B b) {       doSomethingWithA();       b.doSomethingWithB();     }     [...] }  class B {     [...] } </code></pre>  <ol> <li>Make static (? missing name of the refactoring?):</li> </ol>  <p>.</p>  <pre><code>class A {     static method(A a, B b) {       a.doSomethingWithA();       b.doSomethingWithB();     }     [...] }  class B {     [...] } </code></pre>  <ol start="2"> <li>Move Method</li> </ol>  <p>.</p>  <pre><code>class A {     [...] }  class B {     static method(A a, B b) {       a.doSomethingWithA();       b.doSomethingWithB();     }     [...] } </code></pre>  <ol start="3"> <li>Convert to Member Method (?? What would be the correct name?)</li> </ol>  <p>.</p>  <pre><code>class A {     [...] }  class B {     method(A a) {       a.doSomethingWithA();       doSomethingWithB();     }     [...] } </code></pre>  <p>So anyone knowing something to do this step by step in Eclipse or do know the name of the refactorings is welcome. The goal is to have IDE support for every step.</p>
