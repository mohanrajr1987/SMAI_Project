<p>I'm pretty new to developing mobile apps. I have written an HTML5 game and would like to make it available on Google Play and on the Apple store. The web is full of frameworks, services, cloud services, helpers, etc. that facilitate the development, deployment, update, etc. of mobile apps.</p>  <p>They're so plenty I'm not even sure where to begin.</p>  <p>My question: Which one would you recommend, and for what steps? Knowing that:</p>  <ul> <li>My code is in HTML5 and I can't rewrite it in C++ and Swing for the target platforms. Is that where Cordova (or Phonegap?) kicks in?</li> <li>I'm using a windows machine for now as my mac computer needs a new hard disk.</li> <li>I would like to test my app using a device (i.e. not the browser). Physical, virtual, as long as it's reliable and doesn't take 5 mins between I hit "build" and the moment the app starts running :-)  <ul> <li>I have both a 4s iPhone and S3 Galaxy.</li> <li>I see things like "Ionic deploy", "phonegap build" self-updating apps (without needing the user to perform appstore-based "update").</li> <li>Seems there also are cloud services "creating packages for all platforms" without needing to have the various IDEs installed. Did I get it right?</li> </ul></li> </ul>  <p>NB wishful thinking here: I imagine there exists a method similar to a web developer's "F5" key to allow a "one step build &amp; deploy" capability. I'm not that genius programmer hitting the "build" switch every 20 mins and writing code that compiles/works immediately. I really need tools making deployment easy for lots of trial &amp; error?</p>  <p>This is quite an open question, thanks in advance for your leads / experiences / advices!</p>
