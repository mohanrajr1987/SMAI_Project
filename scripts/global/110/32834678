<p>I have the following library: <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/RPi.GPIO" rel="nofollow">https://pypi.python.org/pypi/RPi.GPIO</a></p>  <p>I wish to add it to intelliJ so I get autocomplete support.  However I can't see to find an option to add a library.</p>  <p>I tried Project Structure > Dependencies > + > Library > New Library </p>  <p>But that just gives me options for a New Library for "Java", "From Marven" and "Scala", but NOT python. </p>  <p>Help!</p>  <p>Note: I do have the Python InteliJ plugin installed and I created this project by clicking a new Python Project within InteliJ before anyone asks.</p>
