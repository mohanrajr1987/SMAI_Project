<p>I just opened a fifth workspace and i don't know why but my Eclipse words on the editor became so Pale\light or whatever you want to call it.</p>  <p>It became like <code>Android Studio</code> editor with the pale keywords and colors.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/1rUay.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/1rUay.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Why is that? How do i get the colors of the keywords to be darker? (the blue and purple).</p>  <p>And also my import statements don't have the Plus - Minus sign to fold and unfold them.</p>  <p>Also some of the variables are not blue (not the ones you see in the pic).</p>  <p>Please help me. Thank you.</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/2wrFn.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/2wrFn.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>The <code>WifiManager</code> variable not supposed to be blue??</p>
