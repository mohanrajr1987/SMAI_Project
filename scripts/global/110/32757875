<p>We loaded an existing (running well with VS2013) project into Visual Studio 2015 and got the problem that editing Visual-Basic workflow (WF activities) expression (e.g. in the assign-activity) opens an obviously broken (sometimes white sometimes a crumbled oneliner) Expression Editor popup window. This seems to be an issue with Visual Basic only but we require that because C# workflows are not "client-able".</p>
