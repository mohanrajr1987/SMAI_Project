<p>I'd love to ask someone to hint me what to do. I have installed Dev-C++ on my computer (the 5.11 ver.) I don't know what happened to it, if it's Windows 8.1 problem or some other I really don't know, but when I start to debug, it simply stops working. What exactly happens: I open dev-c++, then I open my *.c file. I set a breakpoint in my source code, and when I hit debug, a pop-up windows shows:</p>  <pre><code>You have not enabled debugging info (-g) and/or stripped it from executable (-s) in Compiler Options. Do you want to correct this now? </code></pre>  <p>And when I hit yes, it simply stops to respond, and crashes. I have never occured such situation, because on every computer I have worked, I'd got no problem with debugging on Dev-C++. Even running it in compatibility mode didn't help.  I really don't know what to do. For any help, thanks in advance!</p>
