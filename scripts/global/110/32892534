<p>I am running into a frustrating issue with Visual Studio in which every time I open or refresh a solution, Visual Studio locks up for about 30 seconds and then I am met with this error</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/6X4t1.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/6X4t1.png" alt="Visual Studio error"></a></p>  <p>This happens about 10 times, so it takes about five minutes to get a working instance of Visual Studio.</p>  <p>I eventually traced this to entries in Server Explorer to which I don't have access. These seem to be auto-populated from connection string entries in various Web.config files throughout the solution. If I comment out the connection strings, the solution loads fine. But this is not an ideal solution because I don't want to commit these changes to source control.</p>  <p>Is there a way to stop this auto-population of Server Explorer? I don't remember this ever happening in previous version of Visual Studio, so maybe it's new in 2015?</p>
