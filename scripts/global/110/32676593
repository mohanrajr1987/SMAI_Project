<p>When we create a new class in netbeans I have to extend it manually if I have to, I want to extend the new class when it is being created using the New PHP Class dialog box.</p>  <p>Is there any plugin for Netbeans which could help to select a class as parent when creating a new class in "New PHP Class" dialog box in Netbeans 8.0.2 as shown below?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/1cn40.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/1cn40.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
