<p>Do I need to specify a file both in Copy Bundle Resources and Copy Files phase? Also, while I have some understanding of what both of them is for, can someone explain in what ways these to are different and in what ways similar? Lastly, what is the meaning of the directories shown in destination and subfolder field, as for the actual paths? I thought if I put a folder to copy files phase it would ALSO create a folder in the package contents of the app but it did not.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/g83S1.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/g83S1.png" alt="image"></a></p>  <p>I would appreciate if someone helps me.
