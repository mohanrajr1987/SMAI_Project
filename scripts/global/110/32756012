<p>Is there any code completion support for the Ace code editor with C# and .NET classes?</p>  <p>Is it possible to use Microsoft Monaco editor on private sites outside Azure?</p>  <p>Other web based editors out there with code completion, intellisense, coloring for .NET C# I can use freely or buy for a smaller amount (~$20)?</p>
