<p>This doesn't affect the code, but it is kind of annoying. </p>  <p>I have these 3 methods inside my controller:</p>  <pre><code>public function chainOne() {     return $this; }  public function chainTwo() {     return $this; }  public function chainThree() {     return $this; } </code></pre>  <p>The method that is being called once hitting the specific route is this:</p>  <pre><code>public function indexAction() {      $this-&gt;chainOne()             -&gt;chainTwo()             -&gt;chainThree();  } </code></pre>  <p>PHPStorm says <code>method chainThree() not found in class $this</code>. But the code inside <code>chainThree()</code> is being executed without a problem. </p>  <p>How can I fix it? Is it a bug?</p>
