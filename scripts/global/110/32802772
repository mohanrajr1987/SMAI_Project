<p>I migrated on a c# solution for from visual studio 2008 to 2012 and then 2013. Batch build from IDE started last year giving hassle for the solution and also main project for the release build of any CPU.</p>  <p>No problem running debug or just batch build for debug.</p>  <p>The error: <code>Error   34  Files has invalid value "&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;". Illegal characters in path.   Myproj</code></p>  <p>I just can't see what is wrong of the relevant .csproj and .soln files upon viewing and comparing to that of projects has no problem.</p>  <p>I tried created a new project in visual studio from scratch. Still have the same problem. </p>  <p>Right now I had to use the following work around to get a release build: when I ran the batch build for both <code>debug/x86</code> and <code>release/any</code>, I will get that error message for the solution. I can then scope to the main project. Change the the build to release any CPU and right click on the main project to build. After that I seem to be able get a fresh build of the myproj.exe in the bin\release.</p>  <p>After that Myproj.exe runs without problem from bin\release</p>  <p>help is greatly appreciated</p>
