<p>Is there a way to have a JavaScript object without the JavaScript base members showing in Visual Studio 2013 Community intellisense ?  For instance if I create an object like this :</p>  <pre><code>var RazorValues = {     IsFrench: false,     IsValid: false,     UserID: -1,     UserFullName: '',     StartDate: null,     PatientReference: -1,     SaveChangesURL: '',     HasChanges: false,     IsAllDispillValid: false,     IsUserHasRightToValidate: false} </code></pre>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/TV1f4.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/TV1f4.png" alt="enter image description here"></a> When I use the object I see many functions and properties which isn't part of my object but I don't want them, I don't need them and would like to hide them or any way to make a type of object in JavaScript in order for the intellisense to not show them ?</p>  <p>NOTE : I had to add the letter A in front of every property so I have them all at the top but it's ugly !</p>
