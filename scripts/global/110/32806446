<p>I want to build an IDE based on Eclipse for embedded Linux app development. </p>  <p>I know Eclipse CDT is good for c/c++ developing. But I need to do a lot of customization. The <a href="http://gnuarmeclipse.github.io/" rel="nofollow">GNU ARM Eclipse</a> is very close to what I need, but my target architecture is not ARM.</p>  <p>So, where should I start? Is CDT just enough and easy for customization? Thanks a lot.</p>
