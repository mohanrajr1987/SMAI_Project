<p>I have been browsing the web looking for how to enable syntax highlighting of SQL commands in PyCharm. Have tried both the professional and community edition I am able to connect to db and execute queries and explore schema etc, but in a Python script it doesn't detect sql commands.</p>  <p>For a simple script along these lines I would want the sql parts to be highlighted when doing the string concatenations that are necessary in order to execute more complex logic than pure sql. I am using mysql if that makes a difference and have installed the DB navigator plug in.</p>  <p>def main():     import pyodbc     import pandas.io.sql as sql</p>  <pre><code>cnxn = pyodbc.connect('DSN=my_dsn')  sql_command = 'SELECT msg_id, message FROM table a' df_messages = sql.read_sql(sql_command, cnxn)  print(df_messages) </code></pre>  <p>if <strong>name</strong> == "<strong>main</strong>":     main()</p>  <p>Tried with Php storm and using there it is by default. If this is not possible what are the other options in terms of getting Python and syntax highlighting in one?</p>
