<p>In JBoss Devstudio, I am getting this new "error" with Tern: <code>Synchronizing script resources with tern server</code>.  It's not really an error, but it's a process that occurs every single time I click in a JavaScript file.  It's just spinning and freezes up the entire IDE.  This has never happened to me before, and I was working on the project yesterday without any issues.  </p>  <p>Does anyone know what the hell this is?  There isn't really anything on Google except one post that says to upgrade.</p>
