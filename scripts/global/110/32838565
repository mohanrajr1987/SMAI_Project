<p>i have c++ program that is controlled by java script using the SpiderMonkey.  so for running my app i run it like : </p>  <pre><code>MyApp.exe main.js </code></pre>  <p>my question is how can i debug the JavaScript part and the c++ part  if not possible so just the JavaScript part   </p>  <p>from my testing NetBeans and Eclipse working well with c++ and javascript<br> but how to combine both . ?  or just the javascript part<br> as i can't treat as normal web app which is not. </p>
