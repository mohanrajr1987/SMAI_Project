<p>I have PyCharm Professional Edition 3.5 configured to</p>  <blockquote>   <p>use IPython when possible</p> </blockquote>  <p>and in my Run/Debug Configurations I set</p>  <blockquote>   <p>show interpreter afterwards</p> </blockquote>  <p>I use the interactive Interpreter a lot and I really like IPython, but there are some things that I don't like about the way this is handled in PyCharm:</p>  <ul> <li><p>any <code>input()</code> in my programs return empty strings.</p></li> <li><p>Additionally, when an error occurs I can't interact with the Program anymore. (you can when you run a Python program with the <code>-i</code> flag)</p></li> <li><p>There is a lot of space between the last line in the Console and the current line</p></li> </ul>  <p>In IPython the <code>...:</code> prompt in a code block isn't indented 2 spaces and therefore not aligned to the <code>In [?]:</code> prompt.</p>  <ul> <li><p>When an error occurs I get something like this <code> Traceback (most recent call last): File "C:\Program Files (x86)\PyCharm\helpers\pydev\pydev_run_in_console.py", line 69, in &lt;module&gt; globals = run_file(file, None, None) File "C:\Program Files (x86)\PyCharm\helpers\pydev\pydev_run_in_console.py", line 29, in run_file pydev_imports.execfile(file, globals, locals)  # execute the script File "C:\Program Files (x86)\PyCharm\helpers\pydev\_pydev_imps\_pydev_execfile.py", line 18, in execfile exec(compile(contents+"\n", file, 'exec'), glob, loc)  File "C:/Users/ca/Python/Bundeswettbewerb Informatik/Aufgabe2/Ameisen.py", line 133, in &lt;module&gt; function_that_caused_error() </code> I don't need/want to see the traceback from the internals.</p></li> <li><p>When running a file IPython needs to be started which takes some seconds even if I'm not going use the interpreted afterwards. I would like PyCharm to start IPython after the program has ended or when I start debugging (you can start IPython in an interactive console by doing <code>import IPython; IPython.start_ipython()</code></p></li> </ul>  <p>There are some other minor things that I don't like</p>  <ul> <li><p>When IPython is started it prints a lot of text to the console. I don't want to see any of it except maybe the version number (you can usually do this with the <code>--no-banner</code> option, but adding it to the interpreter options doesn't work)</p></li> <li><p>when you type something and press <code>Up</code> it replaces what I have written with the last item of my history instead of replacing it with the last item of my history that start with what I have typed. Plain IPython does this.</p></li> <li><p>I would like to have automatic code completion without having to press <code>Ctrl + Space</code> in the console</p></li> </ul>  <p>The "problems" are ordered by importance. Does anybody know how to change some of them? I could stop using IPython which would solve the second , the third and the fourth problem, but the other ones would still persist. All of this behavior (excluding the IPython stuff) is implemented very well in PyScripter.</p>
