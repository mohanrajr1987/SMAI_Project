<p>What is the IDE used game developers in C ++ for Windows and Linux? I know that there are Microsoft Visual Studio, but it is not available for Linux. Or they develop games for Linux from under Windows? I know that for a cross-platform software development using Qt, but I do not think that it is used in game development.</p>
