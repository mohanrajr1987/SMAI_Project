<p>I was using an older version of eclipse with an older JDK, JRE and now trying to upgrade to a newer version of eclipse I can not see new packages or the interfaces that should show the .java files. I have tried making a new workspace and import doesn't work, even without old files nothing in the package explorer is visible. <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/gaOYJ.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/gaOYJ.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
