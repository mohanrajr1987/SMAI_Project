<p>In Visual Studio when you select project or project items in the solution explorer there are times when you might want to add custom properties to the properties window(the window that pops up when you press F4). Also, to fill in the values of those properties I need to add a button to pop up a form so I can collect information from the user at design time.  </p>  <p>What is the simplest implementation of this so I can get started? How would I create a user interface to collect the value some how by using UITypeEditAttribute?</p>
