<p>I found many tutorials, and examples to set up Sublime Text 3 and hack lang support package.</p>  <p><a href="https://github.com/SiebelsTim/hack-sublime" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/SiebelsTim/hack-sublime</a></p>  <p>Or Atom with Nuclide package on Ubuntu</p>  <p><a href="http://nuclide.io/" rel="nofollow">http://nuclide.io/</a></p>  <p>But none of them worked. Do anybody found a fine tutorial?</p>
