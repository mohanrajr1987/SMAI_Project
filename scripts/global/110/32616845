<p>I may be using the wrong terminology for what I am really asking. But let me describe what I need. </p>  <p>I have two separate apps, one was made first and the second was made later, but the second app has files that I have copy+pasted over from the first app. Now, there are separate apps and projects. But I was wondering if there is a way to to have 1 project but with 2 apps in it and be able to build/compile them as separate apps? This is so that I wouldn't need to have multiple copies of the same Java code in 2 separate places. I want to have the second app dependent on the first one, so that if I were to make a change I wouldn't need to make a change in multiple places.</p>  <p>I've googled and search for my problem, but I get solutions for including/adding 3rd party libraries and dependencies (which I already know how to do), but that's not what I need.</p>  <p>EDIT: I would need them to generate 2 separate APK files.</p>
