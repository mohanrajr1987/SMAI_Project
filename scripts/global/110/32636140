<p>I was used to the Eclipse IDE that when you hover the mouse on any place in the code it shows a text over the editor (in a popup window) with things like the Error of the line, the documentation of the variable and etc..</p>  <p>Now on VisualStudio the same function exists and I'm able to use the texttip to check the objects docs and etc.. my question is:</p>  <p>How can I focus the popup window so I can copy the text from the tip?</p>  <p>PS: On Eclipse that used to be the F2 (or F3, not sure) key.</p>
