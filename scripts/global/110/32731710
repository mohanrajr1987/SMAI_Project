<p>I thought for sure this would be a normal thing, but while reading about Nitrous, Koding, Codio, etc, I couldn't quite find it. </p>  <p>I want to build a site in an online IDE and share a private url with people to use it. I don't want the public to see it, only those that I invite via email or authentication or ???</p>  <p>I thought Codio did it, but it says that no-one can see a private url. And everyone can see a public url. Not what I want.</p>
