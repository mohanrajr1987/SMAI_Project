<p>I got a tab with 3 fragments, the  first tab and the thirth tab has both a listview and the second tab has a listview with a spinner as part of the item row. When I have populated the listview and switch tabs the listview resets on both first and second tab. As I got the thirth tab keep updating the listview when it's selected(up to date. Score list) should I do this for the other 2 tabs aswell? Or is there a trick to keep them from reseting? </p>
