<p>I am developing an iOS app in Swift with the latest XCode - XCode 7 and would like to implement the "Sliding tab layout" feature available for Android apps.</p>  <p>I have seen some iOs apps as well which have Sliding Tab Layout. </p>  <p>Can some one please guide me on how I can create an sliding tab layout in my iOS app. Being fairly new to Swift, I did some research and found libraries and tutorials only for Android apps.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
