<p><em>Side note: I've been designing in wordpress for only a few months, and don't know where else or how else to ask this, so my language may seem somewhat inaccurate.</em></p>  <p>I'm using the Jupiter theme within Wordpress to create my site, which is essentially a textbook. One of the chapters has content I've created with the "tabs' element on the Visual Composer front-end editor. However, the content needs to be formatted so that for each of 5 tabs, within each tab there are nested tabs. </p>  <p>Apparently this function isn't allowed in Visual Composer(dragging the tabs element within another tabs element), so I created class names for each tab and used javascript to append the tabs to be within the corresponding tab. If anyone could assist and tell me why I can't seem to move the other classes to the new tabs, I would really appreciate it. I also tried putting the tabs within an accordion, and that fails as well.</p>  <p><strong>This method works for the first occurrence of a nested tab, but for the others, the same javascript fails to work.</strong> </p>  <p>The page I need assistance on: <a href="http://www.foresightcompany.com/guide/chapter-10/" rel="nofollow">Chapter 10</a></p>  <p>The javascript:</p>  <pre><code>//These next few lines relate to the Chapter 10 page $('.tabonecontent').appendTo($(".tabone").parents(".mk-tabs-pane")); $('.tabtwocontent').appendTo($(".tabtwo").parents(".mk-tabs-pane")); $('.tabthreecontent').appendTo($(".tabthree").parents(".mk-tabs-pane")); $('.tabfourcontent').appendTo($(".tabfour").parents(".mk-tabs-pane")); $('.tabfivecontent').appendTo($(".tabfive").parents(".mk-tabs-pane"));     </code></pre>
