<p>I have to manage a facebook page, in the left side bar there is a tab called "Applications" with two links :</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/L7mVv.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/L7mVv.jpg" alt="Tab app in facebook page"></a></p>  <p>I'd like to add my custom link, so I go to the page settings then Application (see image) : I find the two existing links, but I can't find how to add my custom app (it's a canvas facebook app created from developers.facebook.com)</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/UmdGX.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/UmdGX.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Thanks :)</p>
