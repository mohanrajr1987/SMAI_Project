<p>Good afternoon,</p>  <p>I've been having a problem with Visual Studio 2013 and having several tabs open. I have 3 rows of pinned tabs and Show Pinned Tabs in a Separate Row selected</p>  <p>However, I cannot see the tab of some unpinned documents.  I can open/select the document with the arrow drop down menu on the right, but when I select it, the document does not come up as a tab, so I cannot change it to Pinned Status. I can only see the Class and the Function drop down boxes. </p>  <p>Please see an example below:</p>  <p>I had to black out my file names, but the currently opened tab CanFifo.cpp should be appearing below CanDriver.cpp, as it is unpinned, but it does no appear, and since I don't the the tab, I cannot change it to a pinned status. </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/hT7wM.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/hT7wM.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a> This seems to be a bug or a big flaw with VS2013. Does anyone know how to fix or work around this?</p>
