<p>In my app I have a tabbed view to display and manage the preferences. I'd like to store them by using the Shared User Defaults controller. So, I created appropriate bindings through interface builder...Unfortunately, the bindings I create in the first tab work, while the bindings I create in the other tabs don't. The console does not show any erro message, so I don't know where the problem is. Could someone help me understanding what I'm doing wrong, please?</p>  <p>If this can help, I can see that the Shared User Defaults controller is effectively placed in the first tab view scene. I tried moving it to the tabbed view (the one showing the various tab bar items), but if I do that the bindings do not work even in the first tab... So how can I store values through the Shared User Defaults Controller from all the tab view?</p>
