<p>I have a view pager and have tabs at the very top. Each tab has an icon. I am not using textviews for the tabs. I've tried searching for a way to change the background color of the tabs, but all I get is solutions involving use a textview for the tabs. </p>  <p>Is there a way to set the background color of the tabs without using a textview? I have set icons to the tabs.</p>  <p>Note: The tabs will all be the same color.</p>
