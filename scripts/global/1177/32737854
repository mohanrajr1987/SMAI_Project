<p>This issue is related to smartclient listgrid, web application has bootstrap tabs, where when we open any tab (consider Tab-A) which has checkbox against every record in grid. Those checkbox against records works fine until I open new tab(consider Tab-B). After going back to A tab , check box against record can be selectable but couldn't de-select the same one.</p>  <p>according to my analysis it is happening whenever we open new tab, it seems multiple events getting bind to checkbox and due to this deselect jquery event callbacks fails.</p>  <p>Can anyone help to resolve this issue? any help will be appreciated :)</p>
