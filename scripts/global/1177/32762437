<p>Hi I got a problem with the Wordpress plugin, Revolution slider. When I put the slider inside a tab it seems like it collapses and don't resize itself again. Do anyone know how to solve this? </p>  <p><a href="http://xn--fnpark-pua9l.dk/om-os-3/" rel="nofollow">This page shows what I'm talking about</a></p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>  <p>EDIT: It's only visible when switching between tabs!</p>
