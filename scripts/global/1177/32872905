<p>When I use  with some content, the performance when using Internet Explorer is really poor. It improved significantly when i upgraded to angular-material 0.11.1, but is still poor (content mainly consists of md-lists, but no tab has more than 12 items..). The performance gets even worse if I need to use the md-dynamic-height directive.</p>  <pre><code>/*UPDATE:  *********  ADDED FIDDLE  See fiddle with IE and Chrome for comparison*/ </code></pre>  <p><a href="https://jsfiddle.net/72fxcg1m/1/" rel="nofollow">https://jsfiddle.net/72fxcg1m/1/</a></p>  <p>So I have two Ideas:</p>  <p>(1) Is there any way to load the tab content only, if the tab which should present it is active?</p>  <p>Like we have 4 tabs each containing 5 items:</p>  <p>Page load: Tab 1 is active, its content is loaded. Content of Tab 2,3,4 is not part of the dom yet.</p>  <p>User clicks tab 3</p>  <ol> <li>Content of Tab 1 is removed</li> <li>Tab-change animation</li> <li>tab-change animation finished: content of tab3 gets added to dom (we could use some kind of loading animation here..)</li> <li>show the content to the user</li> </ol>  <p>(2) adjust height before content gets shown</p>  <ol> <li>First do the change animation</li> <li>load the content</li> <li>adjust the height of the container</li> <li>show the content to the user</li> </ol>
