<p>i have a "problem" with a tab component for tabView from Primefaces. I did a tabView with dynamic  tabs based on a array.</p>  <p>But some tabs can't be rendered, based on a boolean attribute of the object from that array .</p>  <p>I tried rendered="true" or "false" but nothing happens (on tab). I use rendered="#{_item.show}" i tried use disabled feature  and works fine, but is not my need.</p>  <p>Someone have an idea to how to solve this issue?</p>  <p>check my code:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;p:tabView id="tabs" value="#{myBean.list}" var="_item"  orientation="left" style="height:800px!important;" &gt;          &lt;p:tab title="#{_item}" rendered="#{_item.show}" &gt; </code></pre>
