<p>I am working on an application which contains tabs. I have managed the tab navigation in the app by changing the content in ng-view upon tab change. But I have a page in those tabs which again contains tabs. As I can't have 2 ng-view's in a single app, I am facing a difficulty. I have included all the tabs and their respective divisions using ng-repeat. The visibility respective content of all tabs in controlled by ng-show/hide. But here, every time the tab changes URL will also change(using routes). That leads to a $http request to server on each tab change. Can anyone suggest me a better alternative? I will share the code upon request.</p>
