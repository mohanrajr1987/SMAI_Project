<p>I am using the Divi theme in Wordpress. I have to create a set of horizontal buttons as navigation menu. As I am using Divi theme, I created a <em>standard section</em> with a <em>text module</em> and put the following shortcodes in the text module:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt; [button link="http://localhost/res/" type="big" color="green"]Home[/button] [button link="http://localhost/res/verticals/" type="big" color="green"]Verticals[/button] [button link="http://localhost/res/why-res-usp/" type="big" color="green"]Why RES - USP[/button] [button link="http://localhost/res/our-biodata/" type="big" color="green"]Our Bio-data[/button] [button link="http://localhost/res/locate-us/" type="big" color="green"]Locate Us[/button] &lt;/p&gt; </code></pre>  <p>It created a set of five buttons horizontally but they are too close to each other. Now I need to put more spaces in between these buttons. Is their any way to do it?</p>
