Till now the best partial solution i found is this </p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25031769/create-downloadable-custom-theme-and-apply-it-during-run-time">Create downloadable custom theme and apply it during run time</a></p>  <p>But i need some more help . so the questions are :-</p>  <p>1>how will i create such a theme file (not themes.xml) which will include your styles like normal button styles , text styles and all ?</p>  <p>2>How can we extract the drawables out of app and integrate it in a zip file along with the theme ?</p>  <p>3> Once I have managed to solve the previous 2 questions how will i Use this particular theme in my app .
