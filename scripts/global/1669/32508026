<p>Magento checkout stuck with “Submitting Order Information”</p>  <p>Magento Version Magento ver. 1.9.0.1 </p>  <p>The entire process works in the checkout (Billing info, shipping info, shipping method, etc.) except when one finally decides to submit the order, (hit "place order” button) it just hangs at "submitting order information”. After sitting there for a few minutes, the shopper will be returned to the shopping cart, and the order never makes it through!</p>  <p>I hope and assume others have had the same problem? How to fix it? I’m worried that it might be the theme because I’ve haven’t had much luck finding the solution on the internet. (2checkout extension i m using for payment )</p>
