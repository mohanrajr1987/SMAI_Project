<p>The following function in my Wordpress functions.php file</p>  <pre><code>405   function get_first_name($full_name) { 406     return explode(" ",$full_name)[0]; 407   } </code></pre>  <p>works fine on my test server, but as soon as I move it to the test server it causes this error:</p>  <pre><code>Parse error: syntax error, unexpected '[' in ...functions.php on line 406 </code></pre>  <p>Actual file location removed for brevity and security.</p>  <p>This is a very common error which usually means you've forgotten a closing bracket, quote etc. However, I can't see anything like that missing here, and also if that were the case it'd would also error on my test server.</p>  <p>Could it be something further up the in the code - this is the last function on the page? </p>
