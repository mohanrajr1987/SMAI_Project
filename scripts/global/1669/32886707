<p>I'm using custom theme (Net seal by Aeon Hack).</p>  <p>I opened a form, dragged NStheme from toolbar to the form. Project builds successfully. But when I simply close form and then try to open it in designer mode, I get error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>To prevent possible data loss before loading the designer, the   following errors must be resolved:</p>      <p>The designer cannot process the code at line XX, please see the Task   List for details. The code within the method 'InitializeComponent' is   generated by the designer and should not be manually modified. Please   remove any changes and try opening the designer again.</p> </blockquote>  <p>What am I doing wrong?</p>
