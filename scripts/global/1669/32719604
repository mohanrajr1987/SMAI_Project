<p>I want to replace the Ice Cream Sandwich EditText with an EditText that looks like a normal web form (a white box).</p>  <p>I want to replace the default EditText that looks like this. This would be a really bad UI design for my application:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/tXkUY.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/tXkUY.jpg" alt="Edit Text Design Ice Cream Sandwich"></a></p>  <p>How can I easily switch to a "normal" EditText design with white enclosing boxes?</p>  <p>Although I still need the <strong>blue border line</strong> when my EditText has focus.</p>  <p>I allready added this to my styles.xml:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;item name="android:editTextStyle"&gt;@android:style/Widget.EditText&lt;/item&gt;         &lt;item name="android:editTextBackground"&gt;@drawable/textfield_default&lt;/item&gt; </code></pre>  <p>This has the design that I want to achieve, but the problem is that there are no blue border lines when the EditText has focus.</p>  <p>I allready tested the old EditText design (android 1.5 and above), which looks really good, but it has an ugly orange border during focus...</p>
