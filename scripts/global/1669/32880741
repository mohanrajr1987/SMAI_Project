<p>I have created some custom wordpress themes before and they were all reallx standard multi-page layouts.</p>  <p>Is it possible to create a one-page theme where content is shown/hidden via javascript but the different parts of the site are still manageable as "pages" in wordpress?</p>  <p>I guess it is, what do I have to do different from multi page? </p>  <p>Tutorial links if exisiting would be great because I cant find any.</p>  <p>Thanks :)</p>
