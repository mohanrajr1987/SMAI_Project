<p>I'm using Mahapps in my application, I can't seem to get the same behaviour as the example project. Objects (such as checkbox and radiobutton) change from light to dark, when the theme is changed from BaseLight to BaseDark.</p>  <p>In the example application regardless of whether the theme is BaseLight or BaseDark, these objects remain with a light background, and are easier to view.</p>  <p>I have tried explicitly changing the background of these objects to white, but they seem to be unaffected. I am relatively new to wpf, so perhaps it is something obvious I have missed. Thanks in advance.</p>
