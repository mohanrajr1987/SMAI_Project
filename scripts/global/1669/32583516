<p>This is my <a href="http://rupshop.com" rel="nofollow">website</a>. It is built with Magento. I want to reduce the left side menu height from 463px to 400px. I tested via Firebug to change the value in the theme-pink.css file. But after editing, when I save the value and open the file again its still unchanged. Did it use any JavaScript script for validating or something else? If so, how can I change this? Please suggest a better option.  </p>  <pre><code>.cms-index-index .header-v0 .ver-megamenu-header .sm_megamenu_wrapper_vertical_menu {   display: block;   min-height: 463px; </code></pre>
