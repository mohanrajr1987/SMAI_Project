<p>I tried two different dark themes in Eclipse Mars, <strong>Moonrise UI</strong> and <strong>Dark</strong>. Most parts change color after applying one of those themes, but some don't, as you can see here:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/LA75G.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/LA75G.png" alt="eclipse dark theme error"></a></p>  <p>I tried to restart and create a new workspace, but I still have these errors with both themes. </p>  <p>I am running Ubuntu 15.04.</p>  <p>Do you have any ideas?</p>
