<p>We decide to use this "SW market" <a href="http://demo.smartaddons.com/#sw-market" rel="nofollow">Wordpress Woocommerce theme</a> but I am stuck on the building the category section. Just wondering if anyone has the similar experience. </p>  <p>Please click on the <a href="http://wp.smartaddons.com/themes/sw_market/?page_id=612&amp;header_style=style4" rel="nofollow">link</a> and note if we hover over "ALL CATEGORIES" and there it triggers a drop down panel for all categories/sub-categories.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.onebigoutlet.com/" rel="nofollow">This</a> is what I have so far by following their <a href="http://www.magentech.com/documentation/sw-market/#custom-layout1" rel="nofollow">document</a> and apparently what I have is wrong. According to the tutorial we need the back end setting as the following image shows<a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/6QjmO.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/6QjmO.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a>. </p>  <p>Notice the Widget Style is set to "Topmenu", I have tried every widget style inside the drop down given by the theme file but in vain. </p>  <p>I know this is a very narrow and specific question but any insight is greatly appreciated. Thank you !! </p>
