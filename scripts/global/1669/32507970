<p>Windows provides Light and Dark Themes for Windows 10 Universal Apps. This is changed in App.xaml in the application node at Requested Theme.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;Application x:Class="Template.App" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation" xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml" xmlns:local="using:Template" RequestedTheme="Dark"&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Is there a way to make a custom theme? I realize you can make a resource dictionary and put custom colors, but then you have to include {static resource...} at every attribute you want to apply it to. I think it would be easy to define my own RequestedTheme so I would only need to include it one time.</p>
