<p>I am about to start developing a site for a business and will be utilising the WordPress CMS. I haven't used WordPress much and so am inexperienced, however believe that I know enough to get the job done. </p>  <p>Having looked through the design supplied and mapped them across to template pages needed, I have 13 individual templates; some are for specific pages like the Home, Contact, and others are more general, for instance, a gallery template for various categories of images<a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/W4aVH.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/W4aVH.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>What I am asking in this long-winded question is this: is 13 individual template pages too much?</p>
