<p>I have a theme on Wordpress called A and his child called A-child.</p>  <p>On A child I have on A/includes/projects.php a class called project and I want to redifend one method inside this class called method1().</p>  <p>First that I tried is to re-create the same structured on A-child theme : A-child/includes/projects.php and on functions.php put the require_once but the site crashed. Without the require_once nothing happens.</p>  <p>The other thing that I tried is to redifined the method1() on functions.php and no luck, nothing happens again. I thought obvious, but no one knows.</p>  <p>EDIT:</p>  <p>I need that when on the A Theme call $project->method1(); execute the method1() redefined on my A-child Theme.</p>  <p>Any help? </p>
