<p>so i have a little problem, i read about that color can be changed by changing lines in global.css, so i've found that file inside themes directory and change it in colors that i want, so i uploaded it again online but nothing happens. ive tried several methods using cpanel,FTP client, even exported and uploaded new copy of that theme with changed colors, but nothing happens, i dont know what else to do. Everything else is nice, and how i want it but not this one, i just want to change 3 colors that's the point, i dont want that grey color i want orange. and im freaking out dunno what to do. and yea btw i dont want to change colors by changing color scheme. thanks guys for any help :)</p>
