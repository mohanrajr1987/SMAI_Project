<p>Please I have a problem. Indeed, I have built my smartstore application and I am a beginner so after some research I do it. But my theme doesn't reflect what they must reflect; the site is like a site without css.</p>  <p>No error, no warning has been generated so I don't understand why it is like that.</p>  <p>Can somebody help me please? I don't think the problem is with my browser because many site in internet appears well with css. And this is the Aqua black theme;</p>
