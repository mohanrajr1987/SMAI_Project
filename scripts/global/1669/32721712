<p>I've tried redirecting to itself, changing the place of the scripts. If i manualy refresh, perfect, and if a navigate in the menus, it doesnt load.</p>  <p>The wp_enqueue_script function i tried but wasnt able to alter the already working scrripts, to be a collections of standalone, includable, script.</p>  <p>What i want is a simple reload function in php that forces the refresh, therefore, also reloading the javascript.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>  <p>The code looks like:</p>  <p>header body . . . &lt;&lt;&lt; Start of my page >>>>>> . . .</p>  <p>XXXXX HTML/PHP code XXXXXX . . .</p>  <p> ... </p>  <p> ...  . . . &lt;&lt;&lt; End of my page >>>>>> . . . end of body footer etc</p>
