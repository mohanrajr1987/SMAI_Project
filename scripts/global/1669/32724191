<p>I'm styling a Grid component using implict theme and there is some buttons above the grid, like a toolbar. I would like to access one of these buttons. I've created a method that requires a FrameworkElement and I intend to use the button, but I can't access. I have tried this one: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8126700/how-do-i-access-an-element-of-a-control-template-from-within-code-behind">How do I access an element of a control template from within code-behind</a>, but it only works when a user control and it's .cs is used.</p>  <p>Is there a way of doing this using implicit theme?</p>
