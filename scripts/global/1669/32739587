<p>I recently switched from Eclipse Kelper to Mars, and I cannot see my selected text in <strong>certain</strong> dialogs anymore.</p>  <p>For example, the preferences input box works fine. Here is an example of some selected text in the search bar:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/pZQoi.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/pZQoi.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>However, other dialogs, such as <em>find</em>, the selection is invisible. Either it's transparent or it's exactly the same as the background color.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/YuKPQ.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/YuKPQ.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <ul> <li>Why isn't this blue like the rest of text selections?</li> <li>(Where) Does Eclipse override this for certain dialogs?</li> <li>How do I fix this?</li> </ul>
