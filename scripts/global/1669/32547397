<p>I'm attempting to install the 'Iris Dark' theme on my Ubuntu 14.04 machine. I'm using gnome-3, and the gnome tweak tool.</p>  <p>I've downloaded, extracted and then moved the theme into my theme folder like so.</p>  <pre><code>unzip /home/admin/Desktop/IrisDark.zip /home/admin/Desktop/IrisDark sudo cp -r /home/admin/Desktop/IrisDark /usr/share/themes </code></pre>  <p>When I check the gnome tweak tool, it doesn't show up as a theme for either 'Windows' or GTK+. I am able to install other themes using the same method, only having trouble with this specific one.</p>  <p>When I try to open the folder I've just copied in my themes folder, I get 'This location could not be displayed, you do not have the nessecary permissions.."</p>  <p>This does not happen with any other themes I move into that folder, I only lack the read permission for this particular theme. I assume that the tweak tool is also running into that permissions error, and that's why it can't find it, I don't have any idea how I could fix this though.</p>  <p>EDIT: Moving the zipped file to the themes folder, and then unzipping it produces the same result.</p>
