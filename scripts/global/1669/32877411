<p>In wordpress...I created a child theme. Now I want to edit/change a value in main.js file. This file is part of the parent theme.</p>  <p>As far as my research goes, I need to copy the file main.js into the child theme, folder js/main.js, and make the change there. Then, I need to add a file "functions.php" with code that deregister's the original main.js file in the parent theme, and redirect it to my main.js in the child theme's js folder. correct?</p>  <p>Every website I found online explaining this situation, was showing a very short description of the code for the php to deregister/dequeue and then register/enqueue the new file. <strong>Could anyone please write down the simplest functions.php file I need in order to have this done?</strong></p>  <p><strong>From the parent functions.php</strong></p>  <blockquote>   <p>wp_register_script('main', JS_URI . '/main.js', 'jquery', false, true);</p>      <p>wp_enqueue_script('main');</p> </blockquote>  <p><strong>From  js/main.js</strong></p>  <p>I'm only looking to change "play: 10000" for "play:1000</p>  <pre><code>$(function() { $('#slides').superslides({   animation: "fade",   play: 10000,   slide_easing: 'easeInOutCubic',   slide_speed: 800,   pagination: true,   hashchange: false,   scrollable: true });  }); </code></pre>  <p>Thank you in advance!</p>
