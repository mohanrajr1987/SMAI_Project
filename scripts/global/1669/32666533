<p>I'm using child Tesseract theme and trying to change the header to make it align from right to left. meaning I want to make the text start appear on the right side of the header. I tried to add some css code to the style.css sheet i made in the child theme but with no success.</p>  <pre><code>#site-banner {     max-width: 980px;     margin: auto;     min-height: 45px;     z-index: 5;     position: relative;     text-align: right;     }    </code></pre>  <p>i saw in some forum that maybe i need to make the changes in css file called   site-banner.css does it mean i need to create it in the child-Tesseract folder?</p>  <p>Thank you!</p>
