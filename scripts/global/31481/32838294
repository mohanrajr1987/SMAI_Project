<p>I have a bunch of reports with margin formulas. The page margins depend on the current page number and the current page orientation. The formulas are the same in every report. I want to set those formulas by code so I won't have to change every margin in every report manually when the corporate design changes.</p>  <p>What I already found was the BeforeFormatPage-Event. The EventArgs contain only the current page number. What I need is the current page orientation for setting the margins correctly. And this is where I'm stuck at the moment. Is this possible at all and if yes, how can I do this?</p>
