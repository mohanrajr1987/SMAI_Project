<p>So I'm creating a report that I want to pull a specific data from the details to the footer (not sure which footer I should use) and here's a example of the data.</p>  <pre><code>Task    StartDate   WeekNum CompDate    Initial 1        13-Sep       38     16-Sep       TJ 1        20-Sep       39     24-Sep       TJ 5        13-Sep       38     16-Sep       DD 8        23-Aug       35     24-Aug       QA 7        2-Aug        32     7-Aug        QA 1        19-Jul       30     23-Jul       OP 3        1-Aug        31     20-Aug       EZ 5        1-Sep        36     14-Sep       MC </code></pre>  <p>As of right now, I'm able to pull each row out and put it into the detail which I will suppress one I'm able to gather the right data out for the footer </p>  <p>What I want to do is display a table in a footer of a certain task with its CompDate and Initial if it matches the WeekNum but those that was missed or those that is pending. Like this</p>  <pre><code>         Task 1      WeekNum CompDate  Initial 1        Missed    Missed 2        Missed    Missed 3        Missed    Missed …         30       23-Jul     OP …        38       16-Sep     TJ 39       24-Sep     TJ …..      52       Pending   Pending </code></pre>  <p>What I've done right now is made an Excel table template and that I've paste it on the crystal report and is trying to pull a row out so i can put it in the table but the only row I'm able to pull out is the latest or last detail in the report. </p>  <p>Any suggestion? </p>
