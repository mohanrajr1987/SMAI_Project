<p>In Crystal Reports 2008, I can see there are 14 columns in the report (column titles are in the Page Header) but, when I do an Excel Export (Microsoft Excel (97-2003) Data-Only), there are 51 columns. All 14 columns I can see in Crystal Reports are included.</p>  <p>But, I cannot see where all the additional columns in the Excel are being specified in Crystal.</p>  <p>I need to remove one of the columns in the Excel Export as it is not required.</p>  <p>I removed the view, which is used for this column, from Database Expert. But, the column heading still appears in the Excel Export. Once the view was removed, the data becomes mismatched.</p>
