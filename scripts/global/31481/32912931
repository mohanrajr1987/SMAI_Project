<p>Is it possible to get a sum from like different field in the detail section? </p>  <p>For example, </p>  <pre><code>Location     S1      S2     S3 ...... S40          room1        5       4      3         1 room2        2       0      4         2 room3        3       1      1         5 </code></pre>  <p>Is there a way for me to get the sum of for room 1 score from the field S1 to S40? If it can be done in the detail section, that would be great. I don't want to write a formula that is S1 + S2 + S3 ... + S40 but will do if that is the only way of doing it. </p>
