<p>On a client machine, all of the TextFields are displayed with the text cut in half, vertically.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/52rG2.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/52rG2.png" alt="Example"></a></p>  <p>A few fields that display correctly are Formula fields or have a height increased for testing purposes.</p>  <p>This bug started happening without any update of my software, so must be something inside the machine of the user.</p>  <p>It works elsewhere.</p>  <p>The client uses a XP SP3, the only thing that happened (what I can see, using the event viewer) is that a Office 2007 installation failed and after that all reports have this problem.</p>
