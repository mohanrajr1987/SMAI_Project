<p>I have a list of employees and turn-around times, like so:</p>  <pre><code>order | employee | turn-around ------------------------------ 1     | Mark     | 1 2     | Mark     | 2 3     | Mark     | 10 4     | John     | 1 5     | John     | 5 6     | John     | 20 7     | Chad     | 15 8     | Chad     | 20 9     | Chad     | 60 </code></pre>  <p>So, as you can see, the data ends to be skewed somewhat, and so I'd like to summarize each employee by their median turn-around:</p>  <pre><code>employee | median turn-around ----------------------------- Mark     | 2 John     | 5 Chad     | 20 </code></pre>  <p>I'd also like to present each employee with a comparison of how they're doing compared to the other employees. For this summary, I'd like to use the difference from the median of the medians:</p>  <pre><code>employee | median turn-around | median absolute difference ---------------------------------------------------------- Mark     | 2                  | -3 John     | 5                  |  0 Chad     | 20                 | +15 </code></pre>  <p>I'd like to have this automatically done in Crystal Reports 2013 so each employee gets their own page with a histogram of their turn-around times, their median turn-around time, and how it compares to the median of all the other employees' median turn-around times.</p>  <p>Alas, my crystal-fu is failing me in the last part. I have grouped the records by employee, created a formula field to calculate the turn-around time in the details, and created a formula to retrieve the median turn-around for the employee in the group footer. I've managed to create my histogram. But I cannot for the life of me figure out how to aggregate the group medians and report the median of that median without querying the same data again using a subreport. Is it possible to accomplish this without a subreport?</p>
