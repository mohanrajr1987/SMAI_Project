<p>I have done crystal report with master and sub report through ODBC connection(Directly connecting to database using SQL query). Report has around 400 pages and takes 15 mins local but when I have deployed in server it was taking hour to complete. How to increase performance here ?</p>  <p>I am following different approach to overcome above issue using ADO.NET data source(Stored procedure with programmatic) using typed data set.  Here for master report I have bound data source from Stored procedure but how can I bind for sub report pragmatically ? </p>  <p>Each sub report need parameter from master report. I have one master and sub report, both reports needs to bind based on data. Please help me out to bind master and sub report using C# code using Stored procedure.   </p>
