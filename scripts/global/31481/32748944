<p>I m a Doctor ,(Ophthalmic) i.e Eye Surgeon learning Android Online out of interest, This is my second question on Stack Overflow &amp; I realize that this is one of the most efficient way of not getting stuck and learn from experienced developers &amp; Move Ahead So thank yo SO.</p>  <p>My Last Question was about android so is this one.</p>  <p>I m making a simple application on mobile in which user is going to store his inventory &amp; client details. Now the next requirement is the user should be able to generate invoices/prescriptions from the application itself. </p>  <p>When i made this application for Desktop using Java &amp; Swing , I had used Jasper Reports to dynamically pass Data from J-Table &amp; Other parameters usin a hashmap and passing it to the jrxml design template which i designed using ireport Designer <strong><em>community.jaspersoft.com/project/ireport-designer</em></strong>.</p>  <p>I want to do the same for android, not that i did not search or try something before asking a question up here. I couldn't find much documentation &amp; Tutorials to do so.</p>  <p>I m new to SO , hence i don't have enough reputation to insert more than 2 links in the questions this i m marking the links bold &amp; italic to be viewed and explored.</p>  <p>This <strong><em>stackoverflow.com/questions/8890340/android-what-are-the-good-reporting-tools-to-design-and-generate-reports-from</em></strong> Question on SO is asking the same thing. The answer to it is itext &amp; generation of reports over server.</p>  <p><strong>So can we use itext the same way in android as we used in java SE applications ?</strong></p>  <p>Also i have found other alternatives like </p>  <ul> <li>itextG : <strong><em>itextpdf.com/product/itextg</em></strong></li> <li><p>Jaspersoft Mobile - Android Sdk :  <strong><em>community.jaspersoft.com/project/jaspermobile-android</em></strong></p>  <p>Regarding itextG or itext-core i did not find too much other one video on youtube and simple documentation but that i guess is just a PDF creating tool, couldn't find any tutorials on it. <strong>Please help me  if you find anything more on it.</strong></p></li> </ul>  <p>&amp; Regarding Jaspersoft Mobile, If m not wrong says it uses Jasper Server for creating reports etc. which means its again network dependent so it is time consuming as well as one cannot generate reports offline ?</p>  <p>But I m sure there are solutions available because there are android applications available in market which are generating reports taking data from SQlite. Until and unless they are native apps there is a solution , Please someone help me out with what it is.</p>  <p>The apps on the store are </p>  <ul> <li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invoice2go.invoice2goplus&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">Invoice2go</a></li> <li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aadhk.woinvoice&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">Invoice Maker</a></li> </ul>  <p>&amp; Invoice Maker is Remarkably Fast &amp; Effective.</p>  <p>So Summarizing the long story short</p>  <ul> <li>Are there an easy to use offline reporting tools available for android and ios development with documentation &amp; Tutorials to follow ?</li> <li>Can we itext simply the same way we use it in Java applications?</li> </ul>  <hr>
