<p>I want to generate jasper report for available crystal report. I am trying to find a way by which I can convert available .rpt files into jasper jrxml files. But I didn't find any such way? Is it really possible with any tool?</p>  <p>Even I read that Crystal Report is not open source so developing any tool which convert crystal reports to jasper reports is against the law? Is this correct? </p>
