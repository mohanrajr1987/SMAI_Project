<p>I used Crystal report 13.0.2000xx on Windows form with Crystal Report Viewer </p>  <pre><code>Private Sub CrystalReportViewer1_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles CrystalReportViewer1.Load      Dim myConnectionInfo As ConnectionInfo = New ConnectionInfo()     Dim myReport As New ReportDocument()     myReport.Load("path")     Dim myTables As Tables = myReport.Database.Tables      For Each myTable As CrystalDecisions.CrystalReports.Engine.Table In myTables         Dim myTableLogonInfo As TableLogOnInfo = myTable.LogOnInfo         With myConnectionInfo             .ServerName = "localhost"             .DatabaseName = "xxxxx"             .UserID = "xx"             .Password = "xxxxx"          End With     Next     CrystalReportViewer1.ReportSource = myReport End Sub </code></pre>  <p>when I compile and click on export button and choose export to *.xls there is no Excel format option</p>  <p>my old project use an older version of crystal report it have a excel format option why it's missing in newer version of crystal report</p>
