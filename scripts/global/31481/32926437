<p>I am trying to convert a crystal report from 8.5 to 11.The report has a cross tab in it.The issue is ,in 8.5 the order of the columns which were selected in Cross tab button remains same even in customize Style button but,in crystal 11 this order changes due to which the format of the report is getting changed. I tried using the arrows provided in Cross tab but the result is coming same.Also in the 8.5 report there is no alias present while in 11,providing alias is must. Does this also pertains to change in format of report? Please let me know how can this issue be resolved.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
