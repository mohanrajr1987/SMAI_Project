<p>I'm trying to get the data risers to show their value AND a custom label inside the riser itself. For instance, in a simple bar chart showing Miles Driven in a month, I have a chart that shows "53,211" right on the center of the riser. In addition to this, I'd like to be able to say "Miles." So, in the center of the riser it would read "53,211 Miles." I can select the chart option to show label &amp; value, but it just uses the table column name as the label which is something ugly like "METER_1_USAGE" which wouldn't look good inside the riser. Is it possible to add a custom label name to a riser?</p>
