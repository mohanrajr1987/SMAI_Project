<p>I need to get a count of a summary field in Crystal reports desktop. I know Crystal will not allow me to do this, so I need a workaround.</p>  <p>I have tried RunningTotals to no avail. Here is the setup. This example show that there are several records for the related table and there are several occurances of a valueIfPerformed of 1 - what I need to get a count of 1 for that group - not the actual number of times performed. If a group has all zeros then 0 if there is at least one 1 then 1. Now I can do that with a max summary for each group, but I need to get a sum of all groups and this is where Crystal reports is jamming me up - I can't find a way to do this. Any ideas?</p>  <pre><code>Group1      item#      Desc      valueIfPerformed              1234        Details                 xx               0                         xx               1                         xx               1 </code></pre>
