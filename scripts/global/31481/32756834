<p>I have a problem with my report! I wrote a query to get data from database and put them in a dataTable, when I set this dataTable to report, the report shows all the records, but setting this dataTable to datagridView dataSource just works fine.</p>  <p>any ideas where the problem is?</p>  <pre><code>//Get data from dataBase DataTable table = DbClass.Getdata(command);  var report=new Report(); //This shows all the records in database report.SetDataSource(table);  crystalReportViewer1.ReportSource = report;  //But this works fine dataGridView.SetDataSource(table); </code></pre>
