<p>I have a formula field that basically does the following:</p>  <pre><code>If {Date Field} = "1753-01-01 00:00:00.000" Then "" Else {Date Field} </code></pre>  <p>I keep getting the error that I need to use an actual date-time formula. It's really annoying and I don't know what to do! I have tried certain nests to use around the date but they don't seem to work. Hoping one of you know a simple answer.</p>
