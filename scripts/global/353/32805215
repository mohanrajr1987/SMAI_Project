<p>I wanted to send a dictionary to my set of engines in parallel python (ipython).</p>  <pre><code>from IPython.parallel import Client, interactive rc = Client() dv = rc[:] dv.push(dict(mydict = mydict)) </code></pre>  <p>Amazingly, keys are not ordered the same way (all engines dict are, but this order is different from the master). Any simple way to correct this? (OrderedDict seem quite restrictive to me and I am not sure it would be relevant)</p>
