<p>It seems that it possible to make reduction only for odd number of elements. For example, it needs to sum up numbers. When I have even number of elements, it will be like this:</p>  <pre><code>1 2 3 4 1+2 3+3 6+4 </code></pre>  <p>But what to do when I have, for instance <code>1 2 3 4 5</code>? The last iteration is the sum of three elements 6+4+5 or what? I saw the same question <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15161575/reduction-for-sum-of-vector-when-size-is-not-power-of-2">here</a>, but couldn't find the answer.  </p>
