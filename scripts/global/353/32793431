<p>I made a system parallel and did some testing on it but I can't understand what is happening. Each column is a matrix calculation and the time it took to calculate it. Why is it that increasing the number of threads for CPUs reaches a threshold?</p>  <p>When I have 4 CPUs and 4, 8, 16 Threads, why doesn't the system speed up any further? Could it be the cost of read/writing for each CPU being so expensive that the effectiveness tapers off?</p>  <pre><code>**2 CPUs**  1 Thread    0.72 s  10.31 s 34.77 s 42.07 s 120.93 s 2 Threads   0.48 s  7.88 s  22.63 s 28.40 s 82.81 s 4 Threads   0.50 s  7.12 s  24.22 s 28.68 s 80.78 s 8 Threads   0.49 s  6.92 s  24.14 s 28.80 s 80.88 s 16 Threads  0.57 s  6.89 s  24.23 s 29.68 s 81.35 s  **4 CPUs**  1 Thread    0.71 s  10.30 s 34.95 s 43.07 s 120.93 s 2 Threads   0.48 s  7.06 s  22.78 s 28.33 s 82.81 s 4 Threads   0.49 s  5.47 s  20.37 s 21.82 s 67.45 s 8 Threads   0.40 s  5.16 s  17.83 s 21.84 s 61.71 s 16 Threads  0.46 s  5.20 s  17.75 s 22.19 s 65.37 s </code></pre>
