<p>I have the following system parameters:</p>  <pre><code>CL_DEVICE_TYPE_GPU Device maximum compute units = 20 Device maximum Work Item Dimensions = 3 Device maximum Work Item Sizes = 512 x 512 x 512 Device maximum Work Group Size = 512  </code></pre>  <p>As I understand, if Item Dimensions = 1 -- there is an one-dimensional array of work-items in a work group. If Item Dimensions = 2 -- there is a two-dimensional array or matrix of work-items in a work group and so on. Work groups, in their turn, all together represent a set (NDRange).  But I cannot understand how to: 1) determine the maximum number of work-items in array or in matrix inside a work group 2) determine the maximum number of work-groups elements inside a set</p>  <p>I tried to find similar questions and clear answers, but unsuccessfully.  Thanks for help!</p>
