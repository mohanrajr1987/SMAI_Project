<p>I have a list of employees populated from a long string of IDs.  I would like to add them the database in parallel to speed up processing.  What is the correct syntax in vb.net to use parallel.foreach to call a function on each item in a list.  Below is the serial way of doing it.</p>  <pre><code>    Dim employees As New List(Of Employee)()     For Each element As String In ids         Dim emp As New Employee(element)         employees.Add(emp)     Next      For Each emp In employees         emp.AddToDatabase()     Next </code></pre>
