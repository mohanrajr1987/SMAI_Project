<p>I have a random forest model using h2o.randomForest().</p>  <p>Now, I need to score a lot of data using h2o.predict(). Due to some constraints I can not score all the data at once. So basically I want to score different data sets in a loop. So, to speed up the process I want to score multiple datasets at the same time by running the same script in 2 different R instances. But when I do it, one instance runs fine but other instances give me the following error. Sometimes both instances give this error.</p>  <pre><code>Error in .h2o.__checkConnectionHealth(conn) :   H2O connection has been severed. Cannot connect to instance at http://127.0.0.1:54321/ Failed to connect to 127.0.0.1 port 54321: Address already in use </code></pre>  <p>Above error is not even consistent, sometimes I get it sometimes I don't.</p>  <p>I am initializing the h2o and predicting like following in all R instances.</p>  <pre><code>h2oServer = h2o.init(nthreads = -1, max_mem_size = '8g') h2.predict(model, test_data) </code></pre>  <p>How can I achieve this? How do I use the h2o cloud through 2 different R instances?</p>  <p>Thanks,</p>
