<p>In MPI, is it possible to schedule processes in such a way that one core is mapped to one process, the process finishes and then the core starts working on another process in a situation where the number of processes > number of cores? If so, how exactly is it done? As in, using <code>mpiexec --bind-to-core -bycore</code> or using a <code>hostfile</code>, <code>rankfile</code> etc. </p>  <p>Would really appreciate any input.  </p>
