<p>I've got some parallel plyr code, but I'm not sure how well the parallelization works -- I suspect from looking at <code>top</code> that only one thread is working and the rest are just sitting there.  I am having them read from a netcdf3, which I know doesn't support multiple simultaneous reads, but given that the reading is a small fraction of what is done, I don't think that this should be a problem, so long as the system can force the workers to queue, somewhere down lower-level than I am explicitly programming.</p>  <p>So, in order to actually test to see if my workers are working, I'd like to incorporate a line into my function where each worker "sounds off".  For example:</p>  <pre><code>f = function(x){    print(x[1]+x[2])    print(paste("Worker number",getworkernumber(),"at your service")) }  getworkernumber = function(){   ????? }  library(plyr) library(doMC) registerDoMC(detectCores()-1) X = data.frame(x1 = rnorm(100),x2 = rnorm(100)) a_ply(X,1,f,.parallel=T) </code></pre>  <p>How can I write a function that returns which worker is executing a task?</p>
