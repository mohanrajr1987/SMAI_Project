<p>Teradata is built for parallelism. I believe that from the below query we can measure the Parallel Efficiency of user's query</p>  <pre><code>SELECT  USERNAME,  NumOfActiveAMPs, ((sum(AMPCPUTime))/1024) / ((sum(MaxAmpCPUTime) * NumOfActiveAMPs)/1024) * 100 as Parallel_Efficiency, count(1) FROM dbc.qrylog  WHERE MaxAmpCPUTime &gt; 0  group by 1,2 </code></pre>  <p>In a ideal situation, i believe PE can be 100% But for various reasons, i see that most PE (rolled up) is usually less than 50%</p>  <p>What according to you is a good Parallel Efficiency % that we should try to achieve ? I was told that trying to achieve a high PE (like 60% or more) is also not good for the state of the system, not sure of the reason though, is this true ? your thoughts ?</p>  <p>Thanks for sharing your thoughts !</p>
