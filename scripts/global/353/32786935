<p>I've searched around some of the other questions asked about this topic but none quite match the problem that I'm having... Here is the error:</p>  <pre><code>Error in checkForRemoteErrors(val) :    one node produced an error: Operation not allowed without an active reactive     context. (You tried to do something that can only be done from inside a  reactive expression or observer.) </code></pre>  <p>This error is not happening within my <code>server.R</code> file. It is happening when I execute a <code>parLapply</code> function within a different R file. In addition, the part in the <code>server.R</code> that calls this function is in a <code>reactive</code> so I don't know why it's not reactive:</p>  <pre><code>Michaud1998MonteCarloResults &lt;- reactive({     if(input$updateMichaud==0)       return()     isolate({       Michaud1998MonteCarlo(numAssets,                                assetNames,                                numTimePoints,                                MichaudAnalyticsMain()[[1]],                                MichaudAnalyticsMain()[[3]],                                MichaudAnalyticsMain()[[4]],                                lagMichaud(),                                stepSizeMichaud,                                input$graphStartDateMichaud,                                endDate,                                indexReturnsMichaud()[[1]],                                cumulative = FALSE,                                avgTypeMichaud(),                                decayMichaud(),                                normalizeMichaud(),                                expReturnPathsMichaud(),                                bucketsMichaud(),                                smoothingMichaud(),                                smoothingLagMichaud(),                                useEmpiricalMonteCarloMichaud(),                                includeTails(),                                simulateVarianceMichaud(),                                variancePathsMichaud())       })   }) </code></pre>  <p>I have also tried to remove the <code>isolate()</code>. </p>  <p>The line that the error happens on:</p>  <pre><code>library("parallel") parLapply(cl, X = 1:(pathsForVarianceSimulation + 1), fun = varianceresults) </code></pre>  <p>I am also using another <code>parLapply</code> within the <code>varianceresults</code> function (<code>parLapply</code> within <code>parLapply</code>).</p>  <p>I'm not sure why this is happening.</p>
