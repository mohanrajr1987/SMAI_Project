<p>I am already doing multiprocessing but that's not enough.  So, this may sound stupid and immature but is there a way I could get more time slot on the scheduler for my python code basically to get more runtime on my CPU ? I am doing some data analysis and this might help. I have paralleled the code using multiprocesses but even that's not enough and I am thinking since I have 4 cores increasing the no. of processes won't help me any way. Any suggestions ? </p>
