<p>I'm going to use parallel programming in matlab.  Suppose I have a big matrix &amp; I'm going to update value of all cells together. In each step, I'm going to do a process on value of each cell &amp; update it's value.  I'm going to use 'for'. I know 'parfor' is parallel version of 'for', but the problem is that When iteration numbers is large &amp; when each iteration takes little time, it is slower than 'for'. I have a lot of iterations(big matrix) but each iteration takes little time.  How can I parallel my code in Matlab then?</p>
