<p>We are trying to programmatically add a UIView (FB Like button) to our game's main view on iOS (* The game is built using Unity).</p>  <p>The code for adding the like button:</p>  <pre><code>like = [[FBLikeControl alloc] init];  // Calculate position.  int screenWidth = UnityGetGLViewController().view.bounds.size.width; int screenHeight = UnityGetGLViewController().view.bounds.size.height;  int likeWidth = like.frame.size.width; int likeHeight = like.frame.size.height;  int xPos = screenWidth - likeWidth; int yPos = screenHeight - likeHeight;  like.frame = CGRectMake(xPos, yPos, likeWidth, likeHeight);  [UnityGetGLViewController().view addSubview:like]; </code></pre>  <p>On most devices we've tested this works well, and displays the button in the correct position (bottom right corner).</p>  <p>On a few iOS devices (running iOS 6), the button is cut. It looks like its <strong>frame.width equals to exactly 0.5 (half) of its correct size!</strong> but only the width... </p>  <p>What could be the reason for that ? Is this some known bug with iOS 6 or specific devices ? or is our code not correct ?</p>
