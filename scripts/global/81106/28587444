<p><strong><em>Context:</em></strong></p>  <p>Our app uses cocoapods, and one of the pods included is <a href="https://github.com/slackhq/SlackTextViewController" rel="nofollow">slackTextViewController</a>. This pod doesn't support iOS6, but our app has to. In order to work around this, we want to use this component only in iOS7+ and disable the associated feature in iOS6, but the app should still work.</p>  <p><strong><em>The issue:</em></strong></p>  <p>As it happens right now, just by including this pod in our app, iOS6 crashes due to a reference that can't be solved. Which is correct, this pod uses <code>UIKeyCommand</code>, present in iOS7+, which would crash in iOS6.</p>  <p>The problem is that the app crashes even when the code that uses this is commented out. That is, the app never executes any of this; just having the reference present causes the app to crash on start.</p>  <p>So basically the solution is to either have the pod included and the app crashing in iOS6, or remove the pod altogether. </p>  <p>What we want is some way to include this, but disable it somehow for a specific platform. Is there any way to do this with cocoapods or xcode config? Does anybody know why does this happen?</p>  <p>Any help is greatly appreciated in advance.</p>
