<p>I am getting the error "wrong architecture" for the MobileCoreServices framework when I run our app in iOS6.</p>  <p>This framework has been in our project for quite a while, and past releases for iOS6 worked.</p>  <p>What happened was the framework got accidentally deleted from the 'build phases, linking section'.  It was added back in fine, and everything looked to be ok, until the app was run on an iOS6 device.</p>  <p>It appears that adding the 8.1 version of the framework has broken our backward compatibility.</p>  <p>Any ideas on how to resolve this?</p>  <p>Thank You!</p>
