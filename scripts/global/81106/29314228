<p>Working on my first iOS app. I have created nib and a custom tableview cell. The cell has buttons and labels. I am able to access the labels but for some reason I cannot get the properties of the buttons such as set title, for example. I only have access to the following: </p>  <pre><code>cell.followUserButton(sender: AnyObject) </code></pre>  <p>Why can't I just go </p>  <pre><code>cell.followUserButton.setTitle = "Unfollow"  </code></pre>  <p>I looked online quite a bit. Couldn't find anything. Any help is appreciated. Thanks. </p>
