<p>I have ran into a problem. I have updated my code in my xcode project and now on ios 7 the navigationController no longer is working but on ios 8 and ios 6 everything is fine. </p>  <p>When app starts I initialize the navigationController with the HomeView </p>  <pre><code>    UIViewController *viewController = [storyBoard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@"homeController"];     navigationController  = [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewController:viewController];     self.window.rootViewController = navigationController; </code></pre>  <p>When i try to segue to another View in ios 7 the View segues but there is no navigation bar on the top nor any way to go back. </p>  <pre><code>EditProfileController* profile = segue.destinationViewController; profile.firstName = self.firstName; </code></pre>  <p>When i try to push to a View in ios 7 nothing happens</p>  <pre><code>ViewController* view = (ViewController *)[storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@"viewController"]; [self.navigationController pushViewController:view animated:YES]; </code></pre>  <p>I have no idea what I have changed in my code that could of caused this problem. The only things i can think back that i changed and could of effected this was: </p>  <ul> <li>Storyboard Constraints</li> <li>Screen Orientation </li> <li>Push Notification</li> <li>Added Google Analytics</li> <li>Added Crashlytics and Instabug</li> </ul>  <p>But i have no idea where with bug came from. I pulled up an older version of my project everything works fine on that version. So it must of been something I changed. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks guys!</p>
