<p>I'm reading about <a href="http://nshipster.com/ns_enum-ns_options/" rel="nofollow">NS_ENUM &amp; NS_OPTIONS</a>. The author says:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>If you'd like to use either macro when targeting a previous version of   iOS or OS X, you can simply inline like so:</p>  <pre><code>#ifndef NS_ENUM #define NS_ENUM(_type, _name) enum _name : _type _name; enum _name : _type #endif </code></pre> </blockquote>  <p>Is there any reason why you can't use these two macros on OS lower than iOS 6 (&lt; iOS 6)? They are just macros, so independent of iOS versions, but related to a compiler (pre-processor) feature. I cannot find anything on it within the doc.</p>  <p>Any hint on that? </p>
