<p>we have a simple <code>UITextField</code> which lies on a second <code>UIWindow</code>. Touching it will correctly make it the first responder and a keyboard will be shown. However, no touched key, but the backspace, fires the <code>textField:shouldChangeCharactersInRange:replacementString:</code>. Every other <code>UITextFieldDelegate</code> method is being correctly fired. The textfield is created in an Interface Builder and it is not subclassed. Nothing seem to be stealing a first responder.</p>  <p>The bug occurs only on an iPhone 3GS, iOS 6.1.6.</p>
