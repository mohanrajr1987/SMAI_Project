<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/tayXf.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>i'm making a tweak for changing ios 6's status bar time font. The question is, what's the font of ios 7 status bar time text? don't say it's helvetica neue, because it's way bolder and different than that font. i changed all fonts in <code>/System/Library/Fonts</code> . and that changed the font of <code>StatusBar</code> clock as well. but i couldn't get the same look of ios 7 maybe font size is different ? i'm gonna hook the view of statusbar text and re-draw everything but i couldn't find the font yet.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/fq9kw.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>
