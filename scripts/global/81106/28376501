<p>I need to test an application on an iOS6 simulator. Since this iOS version is not part of the current Xcode6 environment, I tried to install Xcode 5.1.1 beside my Xcode 6 installation and use it.</p>  <p>I downloaded Xcode 5.1.1 from the Apple developer pages and installed in in my applications folder. After launch I am downloading and installing the iOS 6.1 SDK from within Xcode.</p>  <p>After that I am trying to launch the simulator (NOT with an app, just a clean launch) but when the simulator window is shown it keeps black. The log says:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Could not lookup service com.apple.iphonesimulator.host_support: 1102</p> </blockquote>  <p>repeatingly. Clicking "Reset Content and Settings..." wont work. I also deleted the SDK file from  </p>  <blockquote>   <p>~/Applications/Xcode 2.app/Contents/Developer/Applications/ </p> </blockquote>  <p>and the 6.1 Folder from </p>  <blockquote>   <p>~/Users/<em>username</em>/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/</p> </blockquote>  <p>And made a fresh install. Also no effect. I know there are a lot of similar questions here on stack, but they all suggest the "Reset Content and Settings..." which wont work for me. Any idea what might going on?</p>  <p>When launching an iOS7.1 simulator from Xcode 5.1.1 it starts up and works like a charm. The iOS7.1 comes with the Xcode bundle, the iOS6.1 simulator has to be installed manually. Maybe that's the problem?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
