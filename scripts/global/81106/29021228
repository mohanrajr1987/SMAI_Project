<p>I would like to have the navigation bar buttons in my ios 6 (and 7) app, so they look similar. I've looked, but I can't find anything. I would also like to find an image that replicates the hamburger icon in this image: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/dpz3C.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i.stack.imgur.com/dpz3C.jpg</a>. How do I remve the border and gradient effect?</p>
