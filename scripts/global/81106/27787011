<p>I've been updating some old iOS apps to iOS8 and have a problem with landscape apps. </p>  <p>The launch image is fine, but other background images are skewed (as if iOS 8 thinks the app is portrait). </p>  <p>In fact, ads - such as those from Chartboost - appear as if the app is also in portrait. </p>  <p>I am not using a storyboard. </p>  <p>I discovered this problem when a few of our landscape apps were rejected (I didn't have an iPhone 6 yet...now I do and now I see the problem). </p>  <p>Has anyone seen this problem? I would appreciate some guidance. </p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
