<p>I've been getting reports of my app crashing on load in iOS 6. It's built with the iOS 8 SDK and works fine on 7 &amp; 8. I've just managed to get hold of an iOS 6 device to test and it does in fact crash on launch with the error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>dyld: Symbol not found: _UITransitionContextFromViewControllerKey<br>   Referenced from:   /var/mobile/Applications/895BC1B3-A362-42C9-8560-5CF40A682A10/myapp.app/MyApp   Expected in: /System/Library/Frameworks/UIKit.framework/UIKit  in   /var/mobile/Applications/895BC1B3-A362-42C9-8560-5CF40A682A10/myapp.app/MyApp</p> </blockquote>  <p>I understand that <code>dyld</code> is a linker problem, but have no idea where to start with this. I've unlinked and re-added UIKit, but still doesn't work.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
