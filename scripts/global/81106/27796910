<p>I want to test my app in iOS 6. Currently I am using Xcode 6</p>  <p>I read some articles that state "you have to download older versions of Xcode (e.g. Xcode 5) and in Xcode 5 download the iOS Simulator 6 and then run in it."</p>  <p>But if I do it like that, I am getting the following errors for only specific XIB files like:</p>  <pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>Command /Applications/Xcode 2.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/usr/bin/ibtool failed with exit code 255 </code></pre>  <p>How I can fix this issue?</p>
