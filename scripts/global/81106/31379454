<p>I'm building an iPhone app in XCode and it was just fine untill yesterday when it started to crash with a <strong>"No valid app key, exiting"</strong> error message in the console. It usually crashes a few seconds after starting, every time at a different point and sometimes it doesn't crash at all. A couple of days ago it was just fine and I haven't touched the code since.</p>  <p>BTW my developer provisioning profile is valid as well as the one for the iPhone. I'm running XCode 4.5 and iOS 6.</p>  <p>Thank you</p>
