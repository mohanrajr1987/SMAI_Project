<p>I have my application installed in my iPad containing some data. Provisioning Profile for this app has been expired. Now when i am trying to open this app, its not opening, I have updated new version on appstore but to update this user must have to open this app. So is there any way to update this app like push notification so that i can send updated app URL and user can update current app ?</p>  <p>@Note : I cant do any changes in my code, Is it possible without any code changes &amp; Just tap on Push Notification in control panel &amp; it ll open in Safari ?</p>
