<p>So, as the title said how i can take screenshots in vb.net, WPF, the normal code for vb.net for screenshot </p>  <pre><code> Dim bounds As Rectangle Dim screenshot As System.Drawing.Bitmap Dim graph As Graphics bounds = Screen.PrimaryScreen.Bounds screenshot = New System.Drawing.Bitmap(bounds.Width, bounds.Height, System.Drawing.Imaging.PixelFormat.Format32bppRgb) graph = Graphics.FromImage(screenshot) graph.CopyFromScreen(0, 0, 0, 0, bounds.Size, CopyPixelOperation.SourceCopy) screenshot.Save("d:\\dcap.jpg", Imaging.ImageFormat.Bmp) </code></pre>  <p>doesn't work because i can't define "Graphics" in WPF, i can't define drawing bitmap too, like i normally do in vb.net</p>  <p>so, what i can do ?</p>
