<p>I was primarily following this tutorial: <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/238657/How-to-use-Commands-in-WPF" rel="nofollow">http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/238657/How-to-use-Commands-in-WPF</a></p>  <p>But then I realize the <code>RelayCommand</code> is part of another framework that I can't use. This is the code I have:</p>  <pre><code>    public ICommand TestCommand     {         get;         internal set;     }      private bool CanExecuteTestCommand()     {         return !string.IsNullOrEmpty(txtUsername);     }      private void CreateTestCommand()     {         TestCommand = new TestCommand(TestExecute, CanExecuteTestCommand);     }      public void TestExecute(object parameter)     {         obj.TestConnection();     } </code></pre>  <p>And the XAML:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;Button Content="Test Connection" Command="{Binding Path=TestConCmd}" /&gt; </code></pre>  <p>But this won't compile because <code>TestCommand</code> is, obviously, an invalid type.</p>  <p>I've looked over this tutorial as well:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/274982/Commands-in-MVVM" rel="nofollow">http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/274982/Commands-in-MVVM</a></p>  <p>But similarly, <code>Command</code> doesn't seem to be a type even though I've added <code>using System.Windows.Input</code>.</p>  <p>Then all the other tutorials I've looked at just use built-in commands like closing the application, pasting from the clipboard and a few other things like that.</p>  <p>So... How do I actually create my command?</p>
