<p>I have a UserControl that currently has a few PreviewKeyDown event listeners, I would like to move these listeners to the MainWindow so that they work not only when the UserControl is the active focus, is there any way to achieve this?</p>  <p>The reason I have them in the UserControl is that the action of the PreviewKeyDown event depends on what TabItem is selected in the UserControl.</p>
