<p>I want to make a desktop application using WPF and a database on Azure SQL.</p>  <p>90% of the time the application will be connected online and can use the Azure database directly. However, about 10% of the time the application will have no connectivity. In the offline case, ideally, the user would sync the application while they have connectivity and then later be able to use the application offline. When they get back to a place where they have connectivity they could then push their changes up to Azure.</p>  <p>I am having trouble coming up with the best solution for this scenario. Direct SQL merge replication won't work from what I've ready with Azure SQL. </p>  <p>The Microsoft Sync framework looks unmaintained and also looks like it will take quite a bit of manual coding.</p>  <p>I would love to hear some suggestions from those that have experience in this arena.</p>
