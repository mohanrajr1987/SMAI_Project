<p>I already know how to get file-system-related icons for specific paths by P/Invoking to <code>SHGetFileInfo</code>.  But that requires an actual path.  Plus, it only returns a single icon.</p>  <p>What I'm wondering is two-fold.</p>  <ol> <li>How one would get both the default folder open and closed icons (I believe they are stored in 'C:\WINDOWS\system32\imageres.dll' or '%SystemRoot%\system32\shell32.dll' but I could be wrong)</li> <li>How to get those icons without actually specifying a path (i.e. via a constant or similar.)</li> </ol>  <p>Is there even such a way or am I going to have to simply pass it a 'dummy' path to <code>SHGetFileInfo</code> and forget about having two states?</p>  <p>For reference, I'm seeking this because we're building a custom tree to display certain file system objects, but they will be displayed underneath a few app-defined groups and we want those groups to resemble the same graphical folders as those used for actual directories.</p>
