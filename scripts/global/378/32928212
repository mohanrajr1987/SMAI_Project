<p>We've made an WPF application with a traditional UI (common controls like tabs, buttons, labels, textboxes, and so on).</p>  <p>We need to add a "night vision" mode, which would make it look like Stellarium's night vision mode, so that it can be comfortably used in places with few or just no light at all.</p>  <p>As far as I've seen, we only have two options:</p>  <p>1) A technique called "shading" (I don't know how this could be implemented in WPF). 2) The brute-force way: defining control's style templates. As you know, this would imply a tremendous work, since we need to redefine every single property for each control being used (borders, background, brushes, etc, etc, etc).</p>  <p>The question are:</p>  <p>1) What's the best way to achieve this in WPF?</p>  <p>2) Would it be more complicated if we work with MahApps Metro Style? I know MahApps lets you customize their style, but the problem then would be switching between to different templates (the two used for day and night vision, respectively).</p>  <p>Thank you very much!</p>
