<p>I am relativly new to WPF and I have a question concerning transitions in WPF:</p>  <p>How do I create and use them? My google search result are mostly about <em>animations</em> not <em>transitions</em>.  My goal is to create something like this:</p>  <p>Imagine I have a shape:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;Rectangle Width="100" Height="200" Name="shape_01" x:Key="shape_01" Fill="Green"/&gt; </code></pre>  <p>whoms rotation will be set during run-time to (yet) unknown values. Meaning, that I cannot use a <code>Storyboard</code> or <code>Animation</code> to create a transition. I use the following code to set the rotation angle:</p>  <pre><code>double angle = ....;  ((shape_01.RenderTransform as TransformGroup)     .Children.First(_ =&gt; _ is RotateTransform) as RotateTransform)     .Angle = angle; </code></pre>  <p>How can I transition the previous value to the currently set value?</p>
