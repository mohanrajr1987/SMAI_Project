<p>I want to add a huge amount (100K) of Rectangle to a Canvas, programmatically. Unfortunately my code is slow if I do this one by one via Add(). Since I exactly know the number of new elements, I'm looking for a method to first initialize a set of new instances and then add just this set to the UIElementCollection (Canvas children). I was looking for a method like AddRange, CopyFrom (array) or so. Any idea?</p>
