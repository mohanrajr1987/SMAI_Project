<p>I don't know enough about CRMF format but I need to generate CRMF format certificate request from a C# program and submit it to CA. I searched around but didn't find any useful information. </p>  <p>I cannot use Bouncy Castle or any other third-party crypto API. I am wondering if Microsoft Crypto API supports creation of CRMF certificate request. Can I create a PKCS#10 request and then convert it to CRMF request with X509Enrollement interface? Does Microsoft Crypto API support this? Thanks in advance.</p>
