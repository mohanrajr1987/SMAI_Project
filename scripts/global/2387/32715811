<p>I have a <code>.p12</code> certificate file and I create my certificate like this:</p>  <pre><code>var certificate = new X509Certificate2(certFileLocation, "mySecret", X509KeyStorageFlags.Exportable); </code></pre>  <p>When <code>certFileLocation</code> is on my desktop and I give the absolute path, the code works. But when I put the entire content of the .p12 file in a new file in my solution and set the <code>Copy to Output Directory</code> property of the file to <em>"Copy if newer"</em> I get a <code>CryptographicException</code> exception that says:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Cannot find the requested object</p> </blockquote>  <p>I also check every time whether the file is in place and it is. What is the difference between these two scenarios and why can't I read the file with the latter approach?</p>
