<p>I can understand that the encrypted data using public key can only decrypted  by server with private key. If we share the same public key with all users.</p>  <p>Can server encrypted data can be read by any one with public key ? </p>  <p>If some one (with public key) in between server and client access data when the data is traveling in the network will he be able to read the data ?</p>  <p>Is it safe to share same public key many users ? </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/39VGZ.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/39VGZ.png" alt="enter image description here"></a>.</p>
