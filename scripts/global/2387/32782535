<p>I'm creating simple voting system, where main restrictions are:</p>  <ul> <li>every person can vote only once</li> <li>each vote must be strictly anonymous</li> <li>system must be spreaded with covering situations where some of vote terminals won't have access to system network all the time so they will send votes periodically to main node.</li> </ul>  <p>By strictly anonymous I mean that there can't be anyone on earth with access to data who voted on what. There must be information about who already voted but can't be information what he voted.</p>  <p>This is simple to achieve by creating 2 buckets (database tables or something) of data, one with information about user that is voting, second with vote but no user data and allow inserting records only into both buckets at once, but only if particular user is not listed in first bucket already. That solution will work, but only if every node of the system can access main database all the time.</p>  <p>So there is second approach to sign each vote with some user data in way that each vote created by that user will have exact same sign but there will be no way to find user using that sign. I don't know how to create that kind of sign.</p>  <p>It can be based on something that only user have or something that only user knows, but it is not stored anywhere else and can be verified if it is legit. Some kind of certificate that won't reveal person it belongs to and can be invalidated if for example someone stole it.</p>
