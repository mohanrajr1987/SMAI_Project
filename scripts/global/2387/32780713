<p>I am developing a feature to digital sign some content. I have valid certificate with a private key. How to digital sign using the private key and bouncy castle?</p>  <p>I tried the following but want some right way to achieve the same using bouncy castle:</p>  <pre><code>X509Certificate2 signingCert =     CryptoHelper.FindCertificate("21A6107EC254457AAF3D4D6FD286FB79");  var rsaObj = (RSACryptoServiceProvider)signingCert.PrivateKey; _privateKey = rsaObj.ExportParameters(true); </code></pre>  <p>Thanks!</p>
