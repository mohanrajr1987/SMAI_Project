<p>I am working with a module where client need to send certificate in http request, now another module came where we need to sign xml data using client certificate. I know signing could be possible through ActiveX by using privatekey where as what we want, to reuse the certificate that client sent to http. I am trying to access privatekey in http but unable, its gives key not found.</p>  <p>I want to be sure that there is no way to sign document by using http client certificate in asp.net. So i will move towards secondary option ActiveX. Any idea please?</p>
