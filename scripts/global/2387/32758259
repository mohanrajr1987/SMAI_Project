<p>I'm doing some crytography in Java and I wanted to know what are the best and common pratices on certificate storage.</p>  <p>Can certificates be loaded from a file or should they always be imported in keystore/truststore ?</p>  <hr>  <p><strong>EDIT:</strong> My use case is to load a private key and a certificate in order to be able to crypt and decrypt data. </p>  <p>The question is: should the private key and the certificate be both in a keystore or can the certificate be aside in a file ?</p>
