<p>I am building a S/MIME envelope in Node.js that needs to be signed. The signing needs to be base64 pkcs7-signature and that far no problem to create using the Crypto module.</p>  <p>The problem is that S/MIME requires the signer's certificate to be included in the signature, something the Crypto module in Node.js is not doing...</p>  <p>Is it possible to include the certificate in Node.js Crypto, or can the Public key be "merged" into the Signature after signing somehow?</p>  <p>TIA!</p>
