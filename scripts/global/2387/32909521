<p>I am new to network security and trying to make one personal password manager. Definitely now I will have to use encryption and hashing algorithms.</p>  <p>I came across to <a href="https://github.com/google/keyczar" rel="nofollow">Keyczar</a> , which provides encryption and decryption algorithms. There I saw following 2 lines which will generate keys.</p>  <pre><code>KeyczarTool create --location=/path/to/keyset --purpose=sign KeyczarTool create --location=/path/to/keyset --purpose=crypt --name=Test KeyczarTool create --location=/path/to/keyset --purpose=sign --asymmetric=dsa </code></pre>  <p>Now problem is I am not sure where to execute them, I am using Netbeans.</p>
