<p>I have a question about a special case of using CTR mode. My input is 1111000011110000 (F0 in hex), and my IV is  00001111  (0F in hex). I am given the stream of bits for the counter to be 110011001100110011001100110011001100 (CCCCCCCCC in hex). The key is 10100011. Encryption is done simply by computing x XOR k, giving y. I am to compute the encrypted output using CTR mode. </p>  <p>From everything I have found, IV must be smaller than the input block (in my case, two blocks of 8 bits, or two 1-byte blocks). Is it even possible to use CTR with IV and x1 being the same width? If so, how?</p>
