<p>I'm trying to find a Zero-Knowledge proof of subgraph isomorphism in the following scenario: Alice and Bob both know about graphs <code>G1</code> and <code>G2</code>. Alice knows about a subgraph of <code>G1</code> which is isomorphic to <code>G2</code>. How can Alice convince Bob that she knows of this subgraph existing without giving Bob any help with finding the subgraph. </p>  <p>I'm a bit confused on the entire concept of Zero-Knowledge proofs, so anything that could help me get started on this problem would be great! Thanks!</p>
