<p>I'm using UI-Router for AngularJS and here is the question - at the moment when I'm clicking a link which sends me to specific state (using ui-sref) I want to send AJAX request to back end, get data, and render them in the template related to this new state. To which event should I listen for making AJAX request? Could you please give me a code example for this listener? I understand that the question seems to be simple, but I'm new in AngularJS world.</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
