<p>I'm using Angulars $http to make calls to my backend services. I can't however figure out why the UI appears to make two calls to my services. I navigate to the Angular partial using ui-router like so</p>  <pre><code>$stateProvider.state('new/client', {         url: '/client/new',         templateUrl: globalContextPath + '/javascripts/partials/modals/client/new.html',         controller: 'NewClientModalController'     }) </code></pre>  <p>Once in my partial and controller I initialize a bit of data.</p>  <pre><code>var vm = this;  var retrieveServers = function () {     AppServerFactory.list()         .then(function (success) {             $log.debug(success);             vm.appServerList = success.data;             for (var i = 0; i &lt; vm.appServerList.length; i++) {                 if (vm.appServerList[i].defaultItem == true) {                     vm.clientServers.push(vm.appServerList[i]);                 }             }         }); };  retrieveServers(); </code></pre>  <p>The factory function itself</p>  <pre><code>factory.list = function () {     return $http.get(globalContextPath + '/api/app-server/list'); }; </code></pre>  <p>Versioning:</p>  <pre><code>"dependencies": {     "angular": "angularjs#~1.4.6",     "angular-ui-router": "~0.2.15",     "bootstrap": "~3.3.5",     "jquery": "~2.1.4" } </code></pre>  <p>I've tried taking the route of just just using $http from my controller but it seems like no matter where I use $http throughout my app all calls are doubled to my backend - this is observed by looking at my hibernate queries always running twice when the front end hits my backend services. I believe to have ruled out the backend by using a soap client and not observing the same behavior. Suspicion point that I currently have - if I place a breakpoint in my functions it appears that a controller is loaded twice. I'm currently investigating if I'm using ui-router incorrectly but no luck yet. Curious if anyone has hints while I continue to stumble.</p>
