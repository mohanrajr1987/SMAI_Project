<p>Our app currently utilizes <em>ui.router</em> to facilitate UI states as well as leveraging the <code>$stateParams</code> service.  Ideally I'd like to continue using this.</p>  <p>I just saw this documentation that the new Angular Router makes use of some component lifecycle hooks - <a href="https://angular.github.io/router/lifecycle" rel="nofollow">https://angular.github.io/router/lifecycle</a>.  I don't know if this is part of Angular 2 or something built-in specifically to NG Router. I'd like to leverage this functionality as we do not utilize any <em>resolve</em> paradigms in our app.  </p>  <p>If this is something wholly incompatible with ui.router, how would one go about implementing a similar solution such that a controller and template could be pre-loaded, with <code>canActivate</code> &amp; <code>activate</code> methods on the controller?</p>
