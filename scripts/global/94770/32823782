<p>Is it possible to configure something globally so that every time a new route is entered it checks to see if the previous route began with /modal and if it did then don't refresh the controller, just remove the top modal from the stack?</p>  <p>I think I could probably achieve this with reloadOnSearch and using search parameters but then I'd have to set every route on the whole site to set reloadOnSearch because any route on the site could launch a modal so this is not desirable.</p>  <p>Any help would really be appreciated.</p>
