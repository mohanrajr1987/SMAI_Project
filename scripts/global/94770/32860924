<p>My App is using <code>Angular</code> and <code>UI-router</code>. There are two pages, the <strong>first page</strong> (state : "book") shows the categories and book list. The book item is clicked, the page will be switch to the <strong>book detail</strong>(state: "bookDetail").</p>  <p>However, when I switch back to book list, it reload the view and do not preserve the scroll and all other stuff.</p>  <p>In my opinion, the relation of <strong>book list</strong> and <strong>book detail</strong> is more like the relation of content and modal, not the parallel views. But I find  it is hard to understand the modal in <code>ui-router</code> state system, because a modal is not navigating you to a specific view, rather just overlaying it. </p>  <p>Any solution to operating the views as a modal and routerizing it with <code>state</code>?</p>  <pre><code>$stateProvider.when('bookList',{     url : '/bookList',     ... }).when('bookList.bookDetail',{     url : '/bookDetail/{bookid}' }).when('bookList.buyBook',{     url : '/bookDetail/{bookid}'     ... }) </code></pre>  <p>As above, the child views should overlay the parent view, and is removed when the url goes back.</p>
