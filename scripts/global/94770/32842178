<p>So I am using UI-Router to build my AngularJS app. However I am confused as to how the URL Routing works in case of nested states mainly due to the conflicting ideas (as per my understanding) provided in the wiki for UI-Router.</p>  <p><strong>The first idea</strong></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/34zi0.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/34zi0.png" alt="idea 1"></a> Hence maybe abstract state is used below</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/IykN6.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/IykN6.png" alt="idea 1"></a></p>  <p><strong>The second idea</strong></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/NSqNs.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/NSqNs.png" alt="idea 2"></a></p>  <p>As given in the documentation (first idea), url of parent state is prepended to that of it's children only in case of 'abstract':true property defined on the parent state. </p>  <p>However the documentation (second idea) also mentions how the above is a default feature.</p>  <p>Aren't the two ideas above conflicting for the same concept ? Or have I completely misunderstood them ?</p>
