<p>I have created a Codepen to better illustrate this: <a href="http://codepen.io/kelvindart/pen/wKJgag?editors=100" rel="nofollow">http://codepen.io/kelvindart/pen/wKJgag?editors=100</a>.</p>  <p>When I navigate from <code>/user</code> to <code>/tabs/tickets</code>, my <code>ion-nav-back-button</code> button disappears and I cannot workout why? I would like to keep it there so I have a "Logout" button essentially.</p>  <p>Any idea why this happens based on current set up?</p>
