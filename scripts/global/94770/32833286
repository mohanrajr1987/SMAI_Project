<p>I'm still learning Angular and UI-Router... as I pretty much went the UI-Router route because everyone was telling me it's the way to go..</p>  <p>I originally had the login page as part of all the States.. but decided it's best to keep it as a separate stand-alone page</p>  <p>But I can't figure out how to redirect to the Login page...</p>  <pre><code>app.config(['$urlRouterProvider', '$stateProvider', function ($urlRouterProvider, $stateProvider) { $urlRouterProvider     .otherwise('');  //what i used to have, will remove this $stateProvider     .state('login', {         url: '/login',         templateUrl: 'Account/Login',     })..etc </code></pre>  <p>so now if i want to redirect to the actual URL now.. how can i go about doing this?</p>  <p>I've tried:</p>  <pre><code>$location.url('/Account/Login'); $location.path('/Account/Login'); </code></pre>  <p>but they just seem to append to the URL.  How can I use UI-Router and go to a page in my project that is not a state?</p>
