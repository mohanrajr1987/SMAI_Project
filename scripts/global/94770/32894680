<p>Making a doctor's website with Angular ui-router which switches partials through ui-sref. I need the ui-sref link to reload on the pages with the javascript widgets so they upload.  Here is the view:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;a ui-sref="home"&gt; </code></pre>  <p>and the state router in the js file:</p>  <pre><code>  .state('home', {       url: '/home',       templateUrl: 'Partials/partial-home.html'      }) </code></pre>  <p>I tried:</p>  <pre><code>ui-sref-opts="{reload: true}" </code></pre>  <p>in my ui-sref but it did not reload the widget. I tried other code I found here and that didn't help either.  Here is the source code for anyone who wants to see: <a href="https://github.com/EBM26" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/EBM26</a></p>
