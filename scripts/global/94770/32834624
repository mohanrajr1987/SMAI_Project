<p>I was told by an old coworker that there's a way to force Angular controller to not cache, and so it'll get the latest data everytime.  I googled and I cannot find the command.. Is there a way to force caching with Angular?  I'm also using Angular UI-Router.</p>  <p>EDIT:</p>  <p>A description of my problem is this.  I'll be on a certain page of my webpage.  Then I click on a button which hits my backend, and if the cookie has expired, it will redirect to the login page.  Once I log in and go back to the page I was originally at, it seems to cache the login page and it'll show the login page instead of the original page that I was at.. </p>  <p>The only way to fix it will for me to hard refresh with F5.. that's why I'm trying to find a way to force Angular to not cache.</p>
