<p>How to detect when <code>head.appendChild(script);</code> fails in <code>webpackJsonp</code>?</p>  <p>Consider an app made of angular, angular-ui-router built with webpack. I create chunks using <code>bundle?lazy!</code> to create chunk files which are lazily loaded on new states. </p>  <p>I compile and open the app, recompile webpack again. I delete the old chunks created from earlier compilation. </p>  <p>The app which was opened earlier still points to old assets. If i navigate to a different route, the old chunk file will be missing and causes an error.</p>  <p>So, how do I check <code>head.appendChild(script)</code> fail and reload the page to use new assets.</p>
