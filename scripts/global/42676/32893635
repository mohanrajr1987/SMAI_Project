<p>Due to language adaptation I need to place some "special" chars in a custom header (chars like é, á, í, ç, and others)...<br> On the server side i'm using ASP.NET MVC.<br> It all works fine on chrome.<br> But in Safari... I can't figure out witch encoding safari uses...</p>  <p>I tried:</p>  <ul> <li>UTF-8, </li> <li>UTF-16,</li> <li>ASCII,</li> <li>Url Encode,</li> <li>a few ISO's  </li> </ul>  <p>but <code>alert(headerValue)</code> always returns crazy chars...</p>  <p>can anyone tell me which encode to use?</p>
