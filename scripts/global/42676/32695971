<p>We have this domino agent that prints a response header "Content-range".</p>  <p>Sample code</p>  <pre><code>public void NotesMain() {   try {     Session session = getSession();     AgentContext agentContext = session.getAgentContext();     PrintWriter pw = getAgentOutput();     pw.println("Content-range: 123 ");     pw.println("Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8 ");     pw.println("Cache-Control: private ");     pw.println("{\"helloWorld\" : \"lorem ipsum\"}");   } catch (Exception e) {     e.printStackTrace();   } } </code></pre>  <p>The thing is that it was working before and the said agent was deployed from our test environment into production.</p>  <p>For some reason, today it's not working in our test environment and but it is still working in production.</p>  <p>Here are screenshots of the response headers viewed in firebug:</p>  <p><strong>Production</strong></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/IDaf1.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/IDaf1.png" alt="prod"></a></p>  <p><strong>Test environment</strong></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/3h6Tr.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/3h6Tr.png" alt="test"></a></p>  <p>The agent in test environment and production still has the same code. However as you can see from the screenshot, agent in test environment doesn't have the Content-range field in the response header. Any pointers on this?</p>
