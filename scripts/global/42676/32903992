<p>I was wondering what is the default <code>Content-Type</code> header option when requesting a json string from an API.</p>  <p>I've noticed even if the requested <code>Content-Type</code> is <code>application/json</code> the response header <code>Content-Type</code> will be <code>text/html</code></p>  <p>Does file_get_contents set the headers automatically based on what it is requesting or does it have a default one that is used always?</p>
