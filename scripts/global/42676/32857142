<p>I am working on a new application which is using AngualarJS framework. For User Authentication, I am using a cleartrust authentication for validating user credentials. Once the application Url is accessed it navigates to clear trust login page and when clicks on login button it will validate the user and once it’s a valid user it navigates to start up page say “index.html” Also clear trust passes HTTP Headers which contains user information’s like UserId, email, working location, etc. So question is, when app.js file is loaded how can I access HTTP Header from my app.js file? Basically I require to get http header while loading the application. Could anyone help me how to access HTTP Headers?</p>
