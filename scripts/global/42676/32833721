<p>I have two Java applications running as servlets on Tomcat.</p>  <p>Application A creates a session on another application, application B.  Application A then uses a session cookie to log into application B.  This cookie is stored in a session variable and is used on subsequent logins:</p>  <pre><code>HttpSession session = request.getSession(false); String cookieValue = session.getAttribute(sessionAttributeName); HttpHeaders headers = new HttpHeaders(); headers.add("Cookie", cookieValue); restTemplate.exchange(uri, HttpMethod.GET, new HttpEntity&lt;&gt;(headers), ProviderCostTOErrorWrapper.class); </code></pre>  <p>This works fine.  But I need the ability to log in to application B using a rest client (I use PostMan).</p>  <p>So I created a service to get the session cookie for application B that is stored in application A's session.  It looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>JSESSIONID=BF5C58B08062C84C648BA4DBE3A776BE; Path=/treatment/; HttpOnly </code></pre>  <p>But when I log in to application b and inspect the session object, it has an entirely different id:</p>  <pre><code>03A85C79914839E4F6D60B343B3535C4 </code></pre>  <p>It also has a different creation time.</p>  <p>Any ideas what I'm doing wrong?</p>
