<p>I'm having an issue with Firefox where it's sending the Authorization: Basic header on every request after htpasswd login, with the htpasswd credentials. </p>  <ol> <li><p>Access the site, a htpasswd authentication box pops up. I put in the credentials and view the site successfully.</p></li> <li><p>Send a request with a custom Authorization: Basic header. On Firefox it's still sending the htpasswd credentials.</p></li> </ol>  <p>It seems like on Firefox it's overriding the Authorization header I'm setting. I noticed that on both Firefox and Chrome, after a htpasswd login, the Authorization: Basic header is set for every request. But Chrome lets me override its value and therefore I don't have this problem. I haven't tested this but it looks like we're having the same issue with Safari.  </p>  <p>Any ideas? Thanks in advance.</p>
