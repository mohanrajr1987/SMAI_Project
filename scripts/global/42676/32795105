<p>Semantically speaking, an API should return an error message adapted to the situation. For instance, if a user make a request to <code>GET /article/2386</code>, it should return (the user needs to be auth to request that API to handle rights management):</p>  <ul> <li>article data if it exists and user has permission,</li> <li>404 Not Found with error message if it doesn't exist,</li> <li>403 Forbidden with error message if user doesn't have permission.</li> </ul>  <p>Now I wonder if it's not wiser to return 403 Forbidden in both cases, as an evil user could try to randomly scan resources and get insights on whether they exist or not (403 if they exist, 404 if they don't). </p>  <p>So would it be advisable to return a 403 in both cases or is it "criminal"?</p>
