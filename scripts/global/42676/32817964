<p>I'm attempting to set custom headers on a per-request basis using AFNetworking, but occasionally the headers will seemingly disappear after being set.  Below is the code used to make a request...</p>  <pre><code>+ (void) getWithURI: (NSString*) uri header: (NSDictionary*) header success: (NSString*) successCallback failure: (NSString*)errorCallback dispatch: (NSString*)dispatchedId {     createManagerInstance();      AFHTTPRequestOperation* operation = [manager GET:uri                                           parameters:nil                                              success:^(AFHTTPRequestOperation *operation, id responseObject) {                                                  [RestWrapper succeededWithJson:operation.responseString dispatchedId:dispatchedId successCallback:successCallback];                                              } failure:^(AFHTTPRequestOperation *operation, NSError *error) {                                                  [RestWrapper failedWithJson:operation.responseString dispatchedId:dispatchedId errorCallback:errorCallback];                                              }];      NSMutableURLRequest* request = (NSMutableURLRequest*)operation.request;     for (NSString* key in header)     {         if([request valueForHTTPHeaderField:key] != nil)         {             [request setValue:header[key] forHTTPHeaderField:key];         }         else         {             [request addValue:header[key] forHTTPHeaderField:key];         }     }     NSLog(@"Headers: %@", request.allHTTPHeaderFields);      [operation start]; } </code></pre>  <p>For 95% of my requests, they go through as anticipated.  Sporadically, however, some will fail and indicate a header is missing.  This has been confirmed by capturing the requests in question using Fiddler and seeing that the headers are actually missing.  Despite this, the console log of <code>request.allHTTPHeaderFields</code> always shows the headers in place.</p>  <p>The only other thing I noticed is that in general Fiddler reports the caching policy as "max-age=0, private, must-revalidate" for each request.  However, whenever a request loses the custom headers, it's caching policy is "no-cache".</p>
