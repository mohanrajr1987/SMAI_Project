<p>I currently working on the project which is API centred application. The restapi is build on code igniter in php. This part works great, I am able to receive data using postman plugin and authenticate with API key.</p>  <p>I know how to receive or post data with angular, but I have no idea how to start with authentication.</p>  <p>I cant find much information on the internet related to X-API-KEY that's reason why I asking this question here. For the front-end I am going to use angularjs. I don't know even when to start. The question is:</p>  <p>How to authenticate with headers using angularjs. I would really appreciate if someone could point me to some resources so I can do some reading.</p>  <p>Kind Regards.</p>
