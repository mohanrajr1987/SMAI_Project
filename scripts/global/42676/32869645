<p>My controller's methods require a header to be set, e.g. <code>X-Authorization</code>. After a new object has been created (<code>store</code> action), I do a forward to show the newly created object (<code>show</code> action):</p>  <pre><code>$request = Request::create(route('api.v1.b.show', ['booking' =&gt; 4]), 'GET'); Request::replace($request-&gt;input()); return Route::dispatch($request); </code></pre>  <p>The forwarding works ok if I disable the authorization check, but it fails otherwise. ie. the header has gone. I would like to copy the request header, which I can get with <code>Request::header('X-Authorization')</code> into the forwarded request. Is it possible?</p>  <p>I have tried without success to do <code>$request-&gt;header('X-Authorization', 'xxxxx')</code>. Also tried PHP's <code>header()</code> before the dispatch and didn't work.</p>  <p>Any ideas? Cheers</p>
