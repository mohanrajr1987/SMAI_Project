<p>When I create an object through POST in my Spray app I'd like to return a 201 status, together with a Location header that has the absolute URI of the newly created resource (including host port  &amp; contextRoot of my app)</p>  <p>Here is an example code fragment from my application...</p>  <pre><code>post {   respondWithHeaders(Location( fullyQualifiedUri("/movies"))) {     entity(as[MovieImpl]) { (movieToInsert: MovieImpl) =&gt; {       addMovies(movieToInsert)       complete("OK")     }     }   } } </code></pre>  <p>Note that I now have to write the method 'fullyQualifiedUri' to return  a URI with host, port, etc.  It would be nice if Spray did that for me automagically.  </p>  <p>Side note: </p>  <p>I think that having the Location header include  the absolute URI of the newly created resource makes it easier on my REST API's clients (although it does seem that there are a  variety of opinions on this.)</p>  <p>Thanks in advance for any guidance you can provide.  -chris</p>
