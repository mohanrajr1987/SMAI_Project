<p>I have a entire site built to work with webapi2. The problem comes when i need to export a file.</p>  <p>In modern browsers, when i make a /Token requisition passing Login and password and them calling the mvc5 method /SomeList/Export it works fine. /SomeList/Export has no especial headers and im not passing the token, i can open this in any of the browsers windows and it still works. I dont now how. Maybe a cookie or something?</p>  <p>the problem is that in ie8 it dosent work. I cant use mvc5 authorized actions.</p>  <p>how this webapi2/mvc5 works? And if it is possible, how to make it work in ie8?</p>
