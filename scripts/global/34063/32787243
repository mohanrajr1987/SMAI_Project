<p>I'm trying to make a deployer plugin,which consists of deploy.dll,deploy.inf and an exe file which will be triggered when the user loads the page. I followed the steps from the following Microsoft page(<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa751974%28VS.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa751974%28VS.85%29.aspx</a>),</p>  <p>it is working fine for IE8 , I sigend the dll files and cab files using a test CA signed certificate and I imported the CA certificate to Trusted CA certs using Microsoft management console.</p>  <p>The above steps make the plugin to work fine for IE8 on windows 7.</p>  <p>when I tried to test the same plugin on IE10 on Windows 8 and 8.1, IE says IE blocked the plugin from installing as deploy.dll is not trusted.</p>  <p>I followed the same steps what I did for IE8.</p>  <p>I'm not sure what went wrong, please some one help me to resolve this issue.</p>  <p>Is there any security related restrictions by microsoft on IE10 on Win8 , 8.1?</p>  <p>as the same plugin works fine on IE11 , IE10 on Windows 7 , and it is not working only on IE 10 which comes with windows 8 , 8.1 OS.</p>
