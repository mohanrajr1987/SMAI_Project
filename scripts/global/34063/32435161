<p>I am making an app which has to check an information from a special webpage. What I need to do is to pass the html content from this page to my existing program, and it does all the rest.</p>  <p>The website where I get the data works in IE8 and newer, so it kinda narrows the problem. I need to make an extension for IE which could copy ALL the html code from the page it has been called from (and save it into a .txt, in the best case), so result would be as on the example:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;html&gt; &lt;body&gt; Hello world &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I know how to make such extensions, the only problem is javascript: I am a newbie. Are there any short solutions for this problem?</p>
