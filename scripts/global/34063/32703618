<p>I have a GWT app that works fine on IE8 . I need it to run on IE11 so I upgraded smartgwt to version 5 and I added "gecko1_8" as a user agent. I'm facing some problems. The app works on IE11 but its behaviour is different and I just don't know why because the code  give me the result I want when I run it on IE8. For example I have some select items, I choose the values I want and when I click on a button it returns data from the database . But now it seems like it doesn't consider one of the my select items . </p>
