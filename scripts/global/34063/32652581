<p>I have found that if i use a responsive map bigger than 720px, it will render fine in chrome and firefox but on ie8 the black hover is misplaced. map</p>  <p>We have some additional inline attributes for width and height that cancel any setting that i apply.</p>  <p></p>  <p>I have no clue from where the width="720px" height="494px" apears just in ie8</p>  <p>How can i fix this issue?</p>
