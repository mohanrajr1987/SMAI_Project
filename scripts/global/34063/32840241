<p>I have a problem with event <em>change</em> on a input select. This code is working in FF and IE9-11, but in IE8 event is not triggered:</p>  <pre><code>$('container').on('change', 'select.selectValue', function(event, element){      console.info(element); }); </code></pre>  <p>I've tried to use observe function but  it is not working. I am using Prototype JS.</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
