<p>It's been a while since I've done anything resembling web development, and I'm trying to get this small snippet of code to work in IE8.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;head&gt;     &lt;script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.3.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/head&gt;  &lt;body&gt;     &lt;input type='submit' id='submit_button'&gt;      &lt;script&gt;         $('#submit_button').click(function(data) {             var query = 'http://data.cityofchicago.org/resource/ydr8-5enu.json';             $.get(query, function(data){                 alert('help please');             });         });     &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/body&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I get the json and the alert pops up fine in Chrome, but when I attempt to run it in IE8 nothing happens. I set up a breakpoint in the IE8 dev tools and I can see that the query variable is being initialized and the get function is being called, but the callback isn't. </p>  <p>I can't see any error messages anywhere in IE8's dev tools, and I don't see any place to inspect network traffic. I might just be missing them however, I find it really hard to navigate. If I use Fiddler I can't see any requests or responses when the get method fires, but I do see them when I use Chrome.</p>  <p>I've looked at similar questions and they mostly seem to involve missing semicolons, which I think I have covered, or cross-domain requests, which I think would have broke Chrome as well. So I'm a little stumped.</p>
