<p>We have a .NET form and submit button that is an asp ImageButton. In IE8, the post back to the server side for the click event never happens. When I fill out the form in FireFox, Chrome, and IE9 and up, the server side method gets called as expected. Also, the issue is only present on our test server and local machines. The live server is able to process the form submission as expected.</p>  <p>I only have one form tag on the page (within the master page. no form tags on the page that is using the master page).</p>  <p>I also copied the aspnet_client directory from the live server to the test server, but the issue still exists on the test server. </p>  <p>There are code changes, but for a test, I reverted all code and published to the test server, yet the issue persisted</p>  <p>I also tried adding the OnClick property to the control and specifying the method name, but that did not work either.</p>  <p>The button and the method are fairly simple:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;asp:ImageButton ID="cmdRegister" runat="server" ValidationGroup="testRegistration" AlternateText="Test" /&gt;  Protected Sub cmdRegister_Click(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Web.UI.ImageClickEventArgs) Handles cmdRegister.Click     'Code that is not reached when client is using IE8 End Sub </code></pre>  <p>Does anyone have any ideas of how I can further troubleshoot this issue or has anyone ran into this issue before and know the answer?</p>
