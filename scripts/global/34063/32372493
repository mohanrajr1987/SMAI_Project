<p>I am currently trying to get an embedded Google map to have round corners. The whole corporation, for which the website is intended are currently terribly stuck with their win7 + ie8 solution, and their project planning team, have no idea what a hassle it is to include something as simple as round corners across the entire website and getting it to work in IE8.</p>  <p>Anyways I have scanned the interwebs and have yet to figure this out. I am currently using the CSS3Pie library for the rest of the site and the recent solution I tried is listed below(which i found at <a href="http://blog.bandit.co.nz/post/31510944554/how-to-round-the-corners-of-a-google-map-embed" rel="nofollow">http://blog.bandit.co.nz/post/31510944554/how-to-round-the-corners-of-a-google-map-embed</a>):</p>  <pre><code>#mask {     overflow: hidden;     position: relative;     z-index: 99;     height: 500px;     width: 500px;      -webkit-border-radius: 10px;     -moz-border-radius: 10px;     border-radius: 10px;     behavior: url(../PIE-1.0.0/PIE.htc); }  #mask iframe {     position: absolute;     top: 0; left: 0;     z-index: 50;     -webkit-border-radius: 10px;     -moz-border-radius: 10px;     border-radius: 10px;     behavior: url(../PIE-1.0.0/PIE.htc); } </code></pre>  <p>Sadly this works all the way down to IE9 but no further, so i was hoping you geniuses had encountered this problem before and could help out. </p>
