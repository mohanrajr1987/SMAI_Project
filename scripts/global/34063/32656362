<p>I have an issue with a React webapp in IE8. The performance is fine in up to date versions of Chrome and FF. But, wouldn't you know it , the client runs IE8 and the app loads views very slowly in this browser , with 4 second load times normal.  I profile the app using in IE8 with  IE8 Developer tools (IE8 running in VirtualBox VM). In the generated call tree two code areas take, on average , <strong>2 seconds</strong>  each. Drilling down into these codes I find React rendering methods such as mountComponent, mountChildren and createContentMarkup. There is a long long tree of these calls with relatively small amounts of time (100-300 ms) taken up with successive MountComponent calls.</p>  <p>It seems as if composite components added to the view are taking a long time to be added to the DOM, surprising for React.</p>  <p>Does anyone have any experience with the same situation, I am unsure how to proceed , except dismantle the composite components added and test for where the problem lies </p>  <p>Thanks for any advice</p>
