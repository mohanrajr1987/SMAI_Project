<p>Im having this real strange issue where IE8 isn't parsing my data attributes on the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag.</p>  <p>For example, I have the following html:</p>  <p><code>&lt;body data-controller="homeCtrl"&gt;</code></p>  <p>When i inspect the page in IE8 developer tools that attribute is completely missing. It is confirmed when i execute javascript in the console (it returns null!):</p>  <p><code>document.body.getAttribute('data-controller')</code></p>  <p>If i view the source, the data attribute is indeed there, IE8 just seems to ignore it or remove it?!?</p>  <p>More strangely, if i have a div within body.. for example</p>  <p><code>&lt;div id="main" data-controller="homeCtrl"&gt;</code> </p>  <p>This works! I can see it in the developer tools and I can read its value with javascript. So bizarre!</p>  <p>Has anyone come across this before? What would cause this to happen?</p>
