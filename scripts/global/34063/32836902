<p>I'm trying to freeze some columns and headers in a gridview in my asp.net application. I found a help from this <a href="http://gridviewscroll.aspcity.idv.tw/" rel="nofollow">site</a></p>  <p>When deployed in production server which has IIS 7 installed in it this functionality works perfectly in Chrome, Firefox and IE9+. However when opened in IE8 or less, though this functionality works fine, all the session values that I've stored gets cleared and gets redirected to login page. </p>  <p>I'm desperately trying to find a solution for this as almost all the users who will be using this application have only IE8 installed in their machines. Does anyone have come across the same issue?</p>  <hr>  <p><strong>UPDATE</strong> When I used this code in my aspx page session expired in IE8 and IE7:</p>  <pre><code>function gridviewScroll() {         $('#&lt;%=grdUserResponse.ClientID%&gt;').gridviewScroll({             width: "99%",             height: 600,             freezesize: 2          }); </code></pre>  <p>However when I used the following it worked fine without any issues:</p>  <pre><code>function gridviewScroll() {         $('#&lt;%=grdUserResponse.ClientID%&gt;').gridviewScroll({             width: "99%",             height: 600,             freezesize: 2,             arrowsize: 30,             varrowtopimg: "Images/arrowvt.png",             varrowbottomimg: "Images/arrowvb.png",             harrowleftimg: "Images/arrowhl.png",             harrowrightimg: "Images/arrowhr.png"         });     } </code></pre>  <p>Don't know what the issue is!</p>
