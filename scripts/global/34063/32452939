<p>After opening an Overlay window from the base screen in IE11, the Radio Button in the base screen becomes <strong><em>unselected</em></strong> from selected. However, the bound model's radio attribute value remains true. Even the radio.getValue() stays true. Only the UI appearance is changed to unselected for no good reason. And this happens only in the IE11 but, the behavior in IE8 is fine. Kindly help to fix this issue.</p>
