<p>I have the following code:</p>  <pre><code>var editLink = $('&lt;a href=# class="edit" id="edit"&gt;').append('edit') </code></pre>  <p>It doesn't work in IE8 and below, which creates nothing at all when I use editLink later on.</p>  <p>This does work:</p>  <pre><code>var editLink = $('&lt;a href=# class="edit" id="edit"&gt;edit&lt;/a&gt;') </code></pre>  <p>However I have a lot of nested attributes to put in, and don't really want a very long piece of HTML in the middle of the jQuery.</p>  <p>Any ideas why the first version doesn't work?</p>
