<p>I'm using RAD PDF viewer to display PDF documents in our application. </p>  <p>We ran into an security issue while using our HTTPS application in IE8 ( Use the Link - <a href="https://pm10beta.healthcaresource.com/OnboardingRenderService/RenderPDF?pdfpath=c%3A%5Ctemp%5Ctestform.pdf&amp;ctl00=Render+PDF" rel="nofollow">https://pm10beta.healthcaresource.com/OnboardingRenderService/RenderPDF?pdfpath=c%3A%5Ctemp%5Ctestform.pdf&amp;ctl00=Render+PDF</a>) - "This webpage contains content that will not be delivered using a secure HTTPS connection, which could compromise the security of the entire webpage."</p>  <p>After verifying the resources used using HTTP watch, I found no resource using HTTP. </p>  <p>Later we found that the issue is due to the getFields() method provided by RAD.</p>  <p>I have also posted a ticket to RAD support itself. <a href="http://support.redsoftware.com/Tickets/Submit/ConfirmationMessage/GTT-168-68715/4oksi5fnj088/0" rel="nofollow">http://support.redsoftware.com/Tickets/Submit/ConfirmationMessage/GTT-168-68715/4oksi5fnj088/0</a></p>  <p>Can someone help me with this issue</p>  <p>Thanks, Venkatesh </p>
