<p>I am using jQuery UI 1.9.2. I am using <code>jQueryUI.dialog</code> to create a modal window.</p>  <p>I am getting a problem when the user tries to use the dialog in IE8. IE8 has a stupid issue where it cannot apply "focus" to an element if it is not visible on the page. My modal doesn't pop up immediately, so this error is causing the rest of the page to crash.</p>  <p>I have looked at this question: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1202079/prevent-jquery-ui-dialog-from-setting-focus-to-first-textbox">Prevent jQuery UI dialog from setting focus to first textbox</a></p>  <p>And while this and many other answers provide work-arounds (creating a hidden <code>input</code> field just before the button to feign that none of the buttons have focus) this will not work for me because it is still trying to add <code>focus</code> to a hidden element which will give that IE8 error.</p>  <p>Is there some kind of parameter or something in the modal dialog call that I can use to NOT add any focus at all?</p>  <p>If I had it my way, I would just like to tell the client to "suck it up and stop supporting 6-year old IE8" but I digress...</p>
