<p>I'm trying to get the max resolution of the user's display-- not necessarily the <em>current</em> resolution, but the maximum the display supports. I know that I can get the current resolution with something like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4982656/programmatically-get-screen-size-in-mac-os-x" title="this">this</a> but I need the maximum (ie: on a MBP 13inch the resolution would be 2560x1600).</p>  <p>I know I can do this in Terminal using something like <a href="http://superuser.com/a/447298">this</a>, but I would like to avoid trying to do something hack-y in the Terminal, and instead do it with Swift. Any suggestions on how I can do this? Thanks.</p>
