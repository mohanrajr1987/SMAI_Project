<p>This is the first thing computer science related that I have ever done.</p>  <p>I am remotely connected to my school's Linux server via the terminal.</p>  <pre><code>ssh username@school.com </code></pre>  <p>I fill in the password and connect just fine. I can make directories and everything.</p>  <p>I have looked up a few posts on how to transfer files from the Mac that I am using to the Linux server, and they involve using scp command. I cannot seem to get this to work, and am unsure which IP addresses I should be inputting. </p>  <p>TIA</p>
