<p>I am trying to enable mod rewrite, specifically to rewrite my url after appending $_GET[variables] to them.  I am currently rewriting my url's using httpd-vhosts.conf to allow all directories in my sites folder to be the domain name and '.dev' to be the extension.</p>  <pre><code>to better show what i am talking about:     I have a path, "/www/sites/somefolder/wwwroot"     vhosts uses "/www" as the directory,      and "/www/sites/%1/wwwroot" as the VirtualDocumentRoot </code></pre>  <p>As such the directory "/www/sites/somefolder/wwwroot" can be accessed using <a href="http://somefolder.dev/" rel="nofollow">http://somefolder.dev/</a> I am using dnsmasq to send all requests to my ip address to this location.</p>  <p>Additionally I am running the latest version of Apache on mac OS X El Capitan.  </p>  <p>Thanks</p>
