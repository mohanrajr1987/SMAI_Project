<p>I've had my system on the OS X developer beta but have now installed the released version of El Capitan, and I'd like to leave the Beta program now.</p>  <p>Oddly the preferences pane for App Store doesn't have the entire row that <a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/unenroll" rel="nofollow">this article</a> details, so I can't change this.</p>  <p>I can't find another way to leave the Beta</p>  <p>Edit: I know I'm still signed up because I just got the system update notification for the developer beta 10.11.1</p>  <p>Edit: App Store preferences without the pre-release option <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/TaVHc.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/TaVHc.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
