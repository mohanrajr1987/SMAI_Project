<p>I just upgraded to Mac OSX El Capitan yesterday, finding that the method I used to run Haskell on terminal do not work anymore.</p>  <p>I used to run Haskell on terminal by typing<code>cd (the path where my .hs file is in)</code>, then type <code>ghci</code>, and finally type <code>:l (.hs file name)</code></p>  <p>But it told me that <code>-bash: ghci: command not found</code> when typing <code>ghci</code>.</p>  <p>So how could I run Haskell on El Capitan? I am not familiar with computer and am just learning some algorithms occasionally for fun, so please avoid technical terms and give me some clear steps to follow.</p>  <p>(I don't know wether it helps or not, I found this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/3n2dmj/candidate_haskell_platform_7102a_for_use_with_os/" rel="nofollow">links</a>, it suggests there is no need to reinstall the whole platform, but I don't know how to download and run the executable file it attached from github.)</p>
