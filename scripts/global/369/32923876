<p>I have set font traits (bold, light) for for several of my labels in an OSX app and now I get these warnings:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/JQsQY.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/JQsQY.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <blockquote>   <p>.../MainMenu.xib:9:   Xcode.IDEInterfaceBuilder.Cocoa.NSObject.BroadSystemFontWeights</p> </blockquote>  <p>without any explanation. Often the meant label isn't even selected when I click on the warnings. Can someone shed a light on what those warnings mean and how to get rid of them?</p>
