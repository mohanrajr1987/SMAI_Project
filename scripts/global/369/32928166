<p>I have a Cocoa app that I created in Swift 2.0 in Xcode 7.0 (7A220), which runs perfectly fine when compiling under Yosemite 10.10.5 with the 10.11 SDK (which comes with Xcode 7).</p>  <p>Since I want my app to be compatible with Yosemite, I manually added the 10.10 SDK taken from a previous installation of Xcode 6. I put the SDK in the Xcode.app bundle alongside the other SDK.</p>  <p>In the Build settings, I then changed the "Base SDK" setting for my project, my app target, and Alamofire's OS X target to use the 10.10 SDK (it's in the list, so I guess it's properly installed). I also set all Deployment Tagets to be 10.10.</p>  <p>When trying to build, I get an error: <code>&lt;unknown&gt;:0: error: Swift does not support the SDK 'MacOSX10.10.sdk'</code> under "build target Alamofire OSX". I get the same error for "Compile Swift source files" if I switch Alamofire back to 10.11 SDK, so it's probably unrelated to Alamofire.</p>  <p>By looking at the following question, I thought that my Swift 2.0 app would compile with the 10.10 SDK: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30825638/swift-2-0-minimum-system-version-requirement-deployment-target">Swift 2.0 minimum system version requirement (deployment target)</a></p>  <p>What am I missing?</p>  <p>EDIT: I tried again with an empty Cocoa project I just created in Xcode and the same problem appears, so it's not linked to anything my application specifically does.</p>
