<p>I want to move a file, in OSX, to another directory:</p>  <pre><code>func moveFile(currentPath currentPath: String, targetPath: String) {  let fileManager = NSFileManager.defaultManager()  do { try fileManager.moveItemAtPath(currentPath, toPath: targetPath) } catch let error as NSError { print(error.description) }  } </code></pre>  <p>Everything is working fine, except the case when the target-directory doesn't exist. I figured out that <code>.isWritableFileAtPath</code> could be helpful.</p>  <p>However, in my declared function I use the full file path (including the filename). </p>  <p>How can I split the filename from the path or more in general: how can I force Swift to create the directory before moving the file if needed?</p>
