<p>I have created a simple tray application which is doing background checks. I have added a submenu to the tray application. I want the Icon of the tray application to be greyed out when I click the "Stop" item of the Menu. </p>  <p>With <code>statusItem.enabled = false;</code> i can grey out the tray icon but I am also disabling the whole application. </p>  <p>Is there any other possibility to grey out the icon or will i have to add another icon and change the icon on click?? </p>
