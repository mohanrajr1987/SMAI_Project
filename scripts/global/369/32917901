<p>I am using the Android emulator on a Mac (the command android avd) and simultaneously running a Ruby on Rails app at 127.0.0.1. I also have my hosts file edited to point mywebsite.com to 127.0.0.1</p>  <p>I'd like to run some GETs and POSTs to the RoR app from the Android app I'm developing. However, none of it seems to be working, I think due to something or other with virtualization and AVD. I don't see anything in AVD about this.</p>  <p>I am also using React Native, if that matters.</p>  <p>How do I allow my app to connect to my RoR server while using the emulator?</p>
