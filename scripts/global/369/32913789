<p>I'm making a mac application where it's necessary to do something when the computer wakes falls asleep and wakes up, but I can't get the listener to work. I feel like I've tried everything. In AppDelegate.swift, inside of the function applicationDidFinishLaunching, I've got:</p>  <pre><code>NSWorkspace.sharedWorkspace().notificationCenter.addObserver(self, selector: "sleepListener", name: NSWorkspaceWillSleepNotification, object: nil) NSWorkspace.sharedWorkspace().notificationCenter.addObserver(self, selector: "wakeUpListener", name: NSWorkspaceDidWakeNotification, object: nil) </code></pre>  <p>and inside AppDelegate.swift but outside of the function applicationDidFinishLaunching, I have:</p>  <pre><code>func sleepListener(aNotification : NSNotification) {     print("Sleep Listening"); }  func wakeUpListener(aNotification : NSNotification) {     print("Wake Up Listening"); } </code></pre>  <p>I've tried a combination of many different things to fix the problem. I tried listening on NSNotificationCenter.defaultCenter(), I've tried changing the selector to "sleepListener:" and "wakeUpListener:", I've tried removing the arguments from both functions, and nothing has worked so far. And the really interesting thing is that I have got two other listeners to work perfectly, "NSWorkspaceScreensDidSleepNotification" and "NSWorkspaceScreensDidWakeNotification", by calling them with </p>  <pre><code>    NSWorkspace.sharedWorkspace().notificationCenter.addObserver(self, selector: "screenSleepListener", name: NSWorkspaceScreensDidSleepNotification, object: nil) </code></pre>  <p>and</p>  <pre><code>    NSWorkspace.sharedWorkspace().notificationCenter.addObserver(self, selector: "screenWakeUpListener", name: NSWorkspaceScreensDidWakeNotification, object: nil) </code></pre>  <p>referencing the functions </p>  <pre><code>func screenSleepListener() {     print("Screen Sleep Listening"); }  func screenWakeUpListener() {     print("Screen Wake Up Listening"); } </code></pre>  <p>So, is this something I'm doing wrong? Is it something I should file a bug report about? If somebody else could run this code in a file, let their display and their computer go to sleep, and see if they get the same errors, that would be extremely helpful. And if somebody knows what in the world I'm doing wrong, that would be even better.</p>  <p>Thank you in advance!</p>
