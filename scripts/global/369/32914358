<p>I'm working on an Automator application that run's an applescript - which interacts with iterm &amp; a vim server. </p>  <p>In iTerm, I have a profile named 'vim' that launches a zsh login shell and then executes <code>'exec /usr/local/bin/vim --servername $USERNAME'</code>. This way, the runs vim in my environment - but when I close the terminal window the whole window closes.</p>  <p>All of the automator app applescript is working - except I haven't been able to figure out how to get a list of sessions from iterm. I want to check if there is a session/profile named 'vim' already open, and if so activate it rather than creating a new window.</p>  <p>I looked through the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gnachman/iterm2/wikis/Applescript" rel="nofollow">examples</a>, and it's obvious how to create a new session and get a handle to it - but I haven't been able to find anything on interacting with a specific window/session/profile that is pre-existing. </p>  <p>Any suggestions? This is the first time I've used applescript and I'm still trying to figure out how to get a list of available elements/attributes.</p>  <p>If I can figure out how to access the list of existing sessions, I assume that something like this should work:</p>  <pre><code>on initSession(sessionName)     tell application "iTerm"         -- the 'sessions' item doesn't exist, i assume there should be some         -- list of sessions i can iterate over, but no idea where to look this up         if sessionName in sessions             activate         else             set vimTerminal to (make new terminal)             tell vimTerminal                 launch session "vim"             end tell         endif     end tell end initSession </code></pre>
