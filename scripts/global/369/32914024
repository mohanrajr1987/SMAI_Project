<p>I'm running into an issue where a Mac OSX 10.11 El Capitan is unable to codesign a binary for adhoc distribution. The issue is bizzare:</p>  <ul> <li>I've transferred a distribution cert on this mac</li> <li>XCode asks me if it can use a private key to sign the ipa</li> <li>Clicking on "allow" or "always allow" does nothing, the password box does not shake for wrong password.</li> </ul>  <p>As a result, I'm unable to export an IPA (this private key has never been used before on this Mac).</p>  <p><strong>How do I fix "unable to click allow or always allow" issue with XCode7 / El Capital?</strong></p>  <p>Attempting to set the distribution cert to "always allow" fails within keychain assistant as well: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/S623J.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/S623J.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
