<p>I have upgraded from os x yosemite to el capitan,  after upgrading I am trying to run "chmod u+s /usr/sbin/pppd" command to fix a error that I am getting in sonicwall netextender client.</p>  <p>Running the command gives the below error</p>  <pre><code>chmod: Unable to change file mode on /usr/sbin/pppd: Operation not permitted </code></pre>  <p>The file is marked as restricted when I list the files in /usr/sbin folder using "ls -lO" command. </p>  <p>Has anyone got a similar error when running chmod for a file marked as restricted?</p>
