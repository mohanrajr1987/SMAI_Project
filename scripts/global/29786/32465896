<p>I have an NSMutableArray of custom objects. The array schema is something like:</p>  <p>LLPG LLAS LIMM EDDB EDDB EDDS</p>  <p>I need to put them in an UITableView and organize them in sections which Are defined by the first 2 letters of the objects in the array: ie </p>  <p>LL (key) LLPG (value) LLAS (value)</p>  <p>LI (key) LIMM (value)</p>  <p>ED EDDB EDDB EDDS</p>  <p>How Can I do? Tired many solution but no one really elegant.</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong> This is not like sortig an array as suggested, but more how to implement the UITableView delegate methods with the NSArray schema explained. Maybe I could create a NSDictionary with the following schema:</p>  <p>Key LL Value NSArray (LLPG,LLAS) but I don't know how to do it</p>
