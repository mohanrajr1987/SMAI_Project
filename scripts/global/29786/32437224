<p>This code:</p>  <pre><code>server_response = [{id:1},{id:2},{id:3},{id:4}] </code></pre>  <p>I am getting above response from server now I want only the list of ids in one array like</p>  <pre><code>ids = [1,2,3,4]; </code></pre>  <p>I know we can do by for loop but it takes long time if thousand of ids inside the response array.</p>  <p>Is there any better way to achieve above equation? </p>
