<p>I have a series of simple sentences e.g. "Hi", "How are you?", "I am fine", "Nice to see you".</p>  <p>I would like to store them in an array.  The problem is I want to display only the first sentence in a single textview. Then when I press a button, it display the second sentence.  So i want it display each of the sentences after a button press. </p>  <p>Which kind of array i should use and how to code it? Many Thanks </p>
