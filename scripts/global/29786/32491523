<p>Just downloaded the Xcode 7 GM build and my project is seeing the following runtime error:</p>  <pre><code>NSArray element failed to match the Swift Array Element type </code></pre>  <p>We see this in a number of places, probably the simples example is this:</p>  <pre><code>var cacheDirectory = NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSSearchPathDirectory.CachesDirectory, NSSearchPathDomainMask.UserDomainMask, true) </code></pre>  <p>However it happens in other places where Array casts had previously succeeded.</p>  <p>This code runs fine using Xcode7-beta6.</p>  <p>This code also runs fine when starting a fresh project with Xcode.</p>  <p>This code also runs fine when the debugger is not attached...</p>  <p>Any ideas? </p>  <p>Stack Trace below:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/O5uDU.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/O5uDU.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
