<p>In Swift, I have an array of strings... Emojis can be in these strings.</p>  <p>As it stands, the emojis get sorted to the very end, but I want them to get sorted to the front. </p>  <p>How would I achieve this?</p>  <p>Right now I do...</p>  <p><code>array.sort({$0 &lt; $1})</code>.</p>  <p>I've thought about using a Regex to see if the value isn't any regular character on the keyboard but was hoping for a better solution.</p>
