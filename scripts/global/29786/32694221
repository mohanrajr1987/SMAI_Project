<p>I am in a strange situation . when i try to reload the tableview using <code>reloadData()</code> it shows the following error . . .</p>  <blockquote>   <p>fatal error: unexpectedly found nil while unwrapping an Optional value</p> </blockquote>  <p>Here is the web service method that retrieves output</p>  <pre><code>func didRecieveOutput(results:NSArray) {  if results.count != 0  {  userOrders = results as! NSMutableArray  dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), { () -&gt; Void in         self.orderList.reloadData() })  }  } </code></pre>  <p>Edit : I had checked my connection as well as delegate &amp; datasource . It works fine with static data . But problem came when I called reloadData(). I had the same problem with static data as well as dynamic (data from server). </p>
