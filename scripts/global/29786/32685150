<p>I am using an NSArray to load objects into my UICollectionView. The UICollectionView has a UIPageViewController associated with it where I am grabbing the index for each page. Depending on what page you are on, I want to load different objects.</p>  <p>I try to do that using the following:</p>  <pre><code>NSDictionary *dictionary = [[NSDictionary alloc] init]; if (self.index == 0) {     dictionary = [self.imageArray objectAtIndex:indexPath.row]; } else if (self.index == 1) {     dictionary = [self.imageArray objectAtIndex:12 + indexPath.row];     NSLog(@"%@", self.imageArray); } else if (self.index == 2) {     dictionary = [self.imageArray objectAtIndex:24 + indexPath.row]; } </code></pre>  <p>Where <code>self.index</code> is the page you are on.</p>  <p>However, I keep getting the following crash:</p>  <pre><code>*** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSRangeException', reason: '*** -[__NSArrayI objectAtIndex:]: index 48 beyond bounds [0 .. 47]' </code></pre>  <p>However, my array does have 48 objects. There are 12 objects loaded on each page.</p>  <p>Does it have anything to do with me setting the dictionary each time? Only thing I could think of....</p>  <p>Help would be appreciated.</p>
