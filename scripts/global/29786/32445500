<p>I have to repair a developed app that use <code>NSDictionary</code> to show data when certain value is selected. But the problem is that this dictionary doesn't show all of the data that I pass to it.</p>  <p>In my situation I have 296 values per <code>NSArray</code>:</p>  <pre><code>NSArray *departments = [aPerson.stringDepartment componentsSeparatedByString:@"--"];  // has 296 el. NSArray *blocks = [aPerson.stringBlocks componentsSeparatedByString:@"--"];  // has 296 el. </code></pre>  <p>I know that each <code>NSArray</code> has 296 values because I debug this app and see its values in Xcode Assistant Editor </p>  <p>Then here is the simple line that make me crazy:</p>  <pre><code>self.depend = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjects:departments forKeys:blocks];  // has 291 el. </code></pre>  <p>This just return 291 values </p>  <p>How can I make sure that every value ges to create a new key/value in my <code>NSDictionary</code>?</p>
