<p>I have an array having objects with different properties. I want to create an array of sets which contain objects with same value of a single property of the object.</p>  <p>Suppose this is an array of object which has property a and b</p>  <pre><code>1: {a:10, b:5}, 2: {a:2,b:5}, 3: {a:20,b:5}, 4: {a:5,b:5}, 5: {a:4,b:20}, 6: {a:51,b:20} </code></pre>  <p>I want to create another array of <code>NSSet</code> of objects with distinct values of property b</p>  <p>so the result would be the following Array of 2 <code>NSSet</code></p>  <pre><code>1: {a:10, b:5}, {a:2,b:5}, {a:20,b:5}, {a:5,b:5}  2: {a:4,b:20}, {a:51,b:20} </code></pre>  <p>How can this be done?</p>
