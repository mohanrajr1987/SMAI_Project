<p>My question is very similar to : <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20344435/obj-c-get-list-of-indexes-in-nsarray-from-nspredicate">obj c -get list of indexes in NSArray from NSPredicate</a></p>  <p>But there is a difference. I have two NSArrays. The first is of names and the other is of phone numbers. I search into the "names" array to search for a name using the following code:</p>  <pre><code>-(void)filterContentForSearchText:(NSString *)searchtext scope:(NSString *)scope {  NSPredicate *predicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@"SELF beginswith[c] %@",searchtext]; self.searchResult = [ForMsgNamrarray filteredArrayUsingPredicate:predicate];  } </code></pre>  <p>I am returned a filtered array which is fine. But based on the indexes of the filtered array I would also like to filter the array containing the phone numbers.</p>  <p>For example if I search "jh" I get "Jhone" in my search array. I also want to add the phone number of john in another array i.e "searchArrayPhNum"</p>
