<p>I've been stumbling with this for a long while.. </p>  <p>I have a large array of objects:</p>  <p>Name Address City Phone</p>  <p>I want to get unique names.</p>  <p>But I need all objects for a specific name. (Name, Address, City, etc</p>  <p>I've tried using this: </p>  <p><code> NSMutableArray *uniqueNameArray = [tempArray valueForKeyPath:@"@distinctUnionOfObjects.name"];</code></p>  <p>But that leaves me with only "name" objects.</p>  <p>I could use some help please. If this has been answered already, please point me to that answer (I looked),and I will delete this question.</p>
