<p>My requirement is to determine changes in address book (which contact(s) and which fields(s) has been changed since the application was last opened.</p>  <p>Now I have two NSArrays as arrSavedContacts(contains previous address book contacts) and arrContacts(current address book contacts). This is how the two arrays looks like</p>  <p><strong>arrSavedContacts</strong></p>  <pre><code>{     firstName = Gayan;     id = 224;     lastName = Udaha;     phones =         (                     {             label = Mobile;             value = "123456789";         }     ); },     {     firstName = Chandrananda;     id = 225;     lastName = "";     phones =         (                     {             label = Mobile;             value = "234567891";         }     ); },     {     firstName = Joe;     id = 228;     lastName = B8;     phones =         (                     {             label = Mobile;             value = "345678912";         }     ); }, </code></pre>  <p><strong>arrContacts</strong></p>  <pre><code>{     firstName = FirstName Changed;     id = 224;     lastName = Udaha;     phones =         (                     {             label = Mobile;             value = "123456789";         }     ); },     {     firstName = Chandrananda;     id = 225;     lastName = "";     phones =         (                     {             label = Mobile;             value = "345678912";         }     ); }, </code></pre>  <p>As the above two arrays, we can notice two changes, 3rd item is deleted and the firstName get changed in the 1st item.</p>  <p>Since we can have thousands of items in the address book, my question is, what is the best and optimum way to compare those two arrays and detect the changed items (deleted, added, changes for the internal fields)?</p>  <p>A code example is highly appreciated   </p>
