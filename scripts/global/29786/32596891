<p>I have an Array containing a few tuples, each of them also containing a tuple and a string:</p>  <pre><code>var myArr = [((String, String), String)]() </code></pre>  <p>Now I want to remove all duplicates. </p>  <p>But it seems that <code>NSSet()</code> or <code>Set()</code> won't work as expected: The compiler says <code>"Cannot invoke initalizer for type 'NSSet' with an argument of type ([((String, String), String)])"</code></p>  <p>Does anyone know a working and elegant way to remove duplicates from an array with tuples?</p>
