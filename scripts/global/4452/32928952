<p>I'm just wondering if I'm given a dataset like mtcars, how would I be able to export all rows and column names into a designated folder.  So ideally, my function would be one consisting of two arguments: the data frame and the folder?  Is it possible to do that or should I instead create a data frame from mtcars first, then export all rows and column names into a designated folder, with the folder name being another input?  </p>
