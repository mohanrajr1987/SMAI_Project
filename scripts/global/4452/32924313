<p>I have a data set similar to the example below. What I want to be able to do is assign all missing values the correct 'Title' value, based on the non-missing values and their associated 'Name'. So all entries with Name 'A' would have Title 'X', and similar for B and 'Y'.</p>  <pre><code>Name | Title ------------- A    |  X A    |  NA A    |  NA B    |  NA B    |  Y B    |  Y </code></pre>  <p>There should only be a single 'Title' value for each 'Name', although this one value may appear multiple times.</p>  <p>I imagine there are several tortuous conditional loops that could achieve this, but I'm curious if there are any tidier/more efficient ways to go about this? </p>
