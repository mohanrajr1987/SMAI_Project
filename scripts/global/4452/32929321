<p>I'm trying to render this file in RStudio with "Knit PDF".</p>  <p>This code is giving an error for me.</p>  <pre><code>--- output: pdf_document ---  ```{r} knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.align = 'center') ```  ```{r} plot(pressure) ``` </code></pre>  <p>The error</p>  <pre><code>output file: test.knit.md  ! Undefined control sequence. l.114 \begin{center}\includegraphics  pandoc: Error producing PDF from TeX source Error: pandoc document conversion failed with error 43 Execution halted </code></pre>  <p>It seems that <code>render</code> is working, but pandoc is giving an error. Is there any problem with my pandoc?</p>
