<p>I want to control the number of tickmarks on the Z-axis in 3D scatterplot using 'scatterplot3d' package in R.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/nLxfP.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/nLxfP.png" alt="enter image description here"></a> <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/xQcic.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/xQcic.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <pre><code>scatterplot3d(x12[,1],x12[,2],pred4,cex.symbol=0.2,lab.z=k) </code></pre>  <p>I tried various values of k in the above command. k=3,4 produced the first image and k=5~12 produced the second. The number of tickmarks are 7 and 10, respectively. (including endpoints) I wonder why it does not work as expected.</p>
