<p>I am using e1071 Cran Naivebayes to create an animal prediction model. All the fields are "y"/"n" except for the number of legs for which I am using the letter l followed by a number such as l0 for snake, or fish, l8 for spider, l6 for ant, l4 for dog.</p>  <p>Here is a sample row from the training table.</p>  <pre><code> type hair feathers eggs milk airborne aquatic predator toothed backbone breathes venomous fins legss tail domestic catsize 25 insect    n        n    y    n        n       n        n       n        n        y        n    n    l6    n        n       n </code></pre>  <p>The unknown animal to be classified will have values "hair" - "catsize".</p>  <p>But the input vector or dataframe row must have valued defined in terms of levels.</p>  <p>The y/n fields must be defined in terms of a levels table [1] "n" "y" and the legss are > levels(Zoo$legss)</p>  <pre><code>[1] "l0" "l2" "l4" "l5" "l6" "l8" </code></pre>  <p>Let's say I want it to tell me what kind of animal a manitee is. And I have a description.</p>  <p>How do I build my input?</p>  <pre><code>type hair feathers eggs milk airborne aquatic predator toothed backbone breathes venomous fins legss tail domestic catsize ??      y        n    y    y        n       y        n       y        y        y        n    y    l2    y        n       n </code></pre>
