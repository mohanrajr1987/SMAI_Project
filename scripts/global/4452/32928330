<p>Hi I'm pretty much stumped on on trying to figure this out and could use a little help. Basically, I have a n x n matrix where the diagonal is set to a value k and every other value is 0.</p>  <pre><code>  1 2 3 4 5 1 k 0 0 0 0  2 0 k 0 0 0 3 0 0 k 0 0 4 0 0 0 k 0 5 0 0 0 0 k </code></pre>  <p>Basically, I need to be able to make two other diagonals in this matrix with the value of 1 so it ends up looking like this: </p>  <pre><code>  1 2 3 4 5 1 k 1 0 0 0 2 1 k 1 0 0 3 0 1 k 1 0 4 0 0 1 k 1 5 0 0 0 1 k </code></pre>  <p>So far all I have for code is being able to make the diagonal matrix  <code>m=diag(k,n,n)</code> but I have no idea on how to add the two other diagonals. Would I use <code>apply()</code> and <code>cbind()</code> or <code>rbind()</code>? </p>
