<p>I have a line (SpatialLinesDataFrame) and want to construct lines perpendicular to this line with a set spacing (construct a line every n-meters). The line in question is not a straight line (river).Is it possible to construct such lines that cross the input line at a right angle in R?</p>  <p>If it is not possible to construct perpedicular lines at a set distance it would also Help constracting them between the center of every coordinates pair. </p>  <pre><code>require (rgdal)  x &lt;- c(18.25721, 18.25763,18.25808,18.25846,18.25864,18.25886,18.25892,18.25913,18.25940,18.25962,        18.25976,18.25997,18.26021,18.26048,18.26061,18.26086,18.26107,18.26128,18.26154,18.26219,        18.26276,18.26350,18.26445,18.26510,18.26584,18.26668,18.26704,18.26807,18.26850,18.26944,        18.27020,18.27080,18.27111,18.27134,18.27168,18.27191,18.27217,18.27254,18.27309,18.27345,        18.27368,18.27389,18.27398,18.27400,18.27392,18.27383,18.27370)   y &lt;- c(44.69540,44.69539,44.69544,44.69552,44.69563,44.69586,44.69608,44.69644,44.69672,44.69687        ,44.69701,44.69718,44.69737,44.69763,44.69771,44.69778,44.69781,44.69781,44.69782,44.69776        ,44.69772,44.69778,44.69794,44.69805,44.69814,44.69822,44.69824,44.69826,44.69821,44.69805        ,44.69775,44.69737,44.69728,44.69717,44.69701,44.69687,44.69671,44.69649,44.69616,44.69598        ,44.69578,44.69560,44.69539,44.69513,44.69490,44.69476,44.69453)  ## Convert to SpatialLines riverSP&lt;-SpatialLines(list(Lines(Line(cbind(x,y)), ID="a"))) proj4string(riverSP) &lt;- CRS("+init=epsg:4326") </code></pre>  <p>Additionally, I would like to get (all) coordinates of the intersections between does perpedicular lines(p1,p2,p3,p4 etc) and other line objects (street, path).
