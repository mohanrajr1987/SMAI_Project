<p>I have a PNG and JPG file of a data table, specifically:</p>  <p><img src="https://img.njdc.com/media/media/2015/09/01/wholechart.png" alt=""></p>  <p>I'm trying to read in this data table into R so I can perform data analysis on the data. However, I'm not seeing how to do this. I can read in the file using the 'png' and 'jpeg' packages, but these do not create a data frame of the data table shown in the image. Is there any way I can get the data table into R?</p>
