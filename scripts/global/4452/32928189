<p>OK, I'm new to R so please be gentle.  I have a dataset that I access via API.  It has descriptive column names already in it.  However, when I import it the column names default to V1, V2, .... V18 and row 1 of the data is the actual descriptive column names {ID, Duration, Timestamp, ...}.</p>  <p>How can I get the column names to be the descriptive ones rather than these apparently auto-generated V#'s?</p>
