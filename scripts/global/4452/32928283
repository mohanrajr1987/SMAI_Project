<p>Is there a <code>which</code> analog for character extraction?</p>  <p>Say <code>x &lt;- c("low"=-10, "high"=10)</code>. It's great that <code>x[c("high", "low")]</code> returns <code>c(10, -10)</code>; for what I'm trying to do, I want the corresponding matched indices, namely <code>c(2L, 1L)</code>.</p>  <p>This seems like it'd be pretty basic, but <code>which</code> is not vectorized and <code>?extract</code> offers no help that I saw.</p>  <p>A solution which seems like it should be overkill is:</p>  <pre><code>&gt; sapply(c("high", "low"), function(y) which(names(x) == y)) high  low     2    1  </code></pre>  <p>Is there no easier way to do this?</p>
