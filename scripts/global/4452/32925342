<p>I am trying to print a line when my data finds a value that is different than expected. I can check for this, but I cannot figure out how to print the line it was found on, and the values of the variables associated to that specific line.</p>  <pre><code>if(all(Cit1$State1 %in% ValidStates)==TRUE){    cat("Success")} else    {cat("State " State1 "is incorrect.\n")    } </code></pre>  <p>Calling out just the column name (State1 in this case) is a SAS technique. In this case, all I get is an error. Is there an equivalent for this in R?</p>
