<p>I have always been confused by how MARGIN seems to mean 2 different things in <code>sweep</code> and <code>apply</code>. Consider:</p>  <pre><code>m &lt;- matrix(1:6, ncol = 2) # The "- 1" operation is applied to all cells in each row sweep(m, MARGIN = 1, 1, "-") # The sum operation is applied to each column apply(m, MARGIN = 1, sum) </code></pre>  <p>Do you have a mnemonic device to understand this seemingly contradictory meaning of MARGIN?</p>
