<p>I am writing a script that would automate a mock sports draft given a pool of players to choose from and roster limits for each position. </p>  <p>How would I structure such a script if I have three teams drafting from the following data frame? </p>  <p>Team 1 is using a different ranking than Teams 2 and 3, which are using the consensus; each team will draft one "QB" and one "RB" and each player may only be drafted once (without replacement). </p>  <p>In my mind, the output would be a single data frame.</p>  <pre><code>players &lt;- c("Dan Marino", "Tony Dorsett", "Joe Montana", "John Elway",  "Jim Brown", "Barry Sanders") position &lt;- c("QB", "RB", "QB", "QB", "RB", "RB") Team1_rank &lt;- c(2,4,5,6,3,1) consensus_rank &lt;- c(1,6,3,5,2,4) player_pool &lt;- data.frame(players, position, Team1_rank, consensus_rank)              players position Team1_rank consensus 1    Dan Marino       QB          2         1 2  Tony Dorsett       RB          4         6 3   Joe Montana       QB          5         3 4    John Elway       QB          6         5 5     Jim Brown       RB          3         2 6 Barry Sanders       RB          1         4 </code></pre>
