<p>The following code compiles a data frame of reviews of businesses and aims to extract the business name from each row.  There are no matches with the regular expression in the first 14 rows, I've noticed, and there's no problem there.  As soon as I include the first row with a match (15 in this case), I receive the following error.  </p>  <pre><code>Error in substring(x[ind], so, eo) : invalid substring arguments </code></pre>  <p>It seems like the problem is between regexpr sending the results to index.list, and regmatches being unable to use the index.list as the proper argument.  </p>  <p>Note that when I run just the 15th row without the mapply, I obtain the proper result.  If there is a more efficient way to get the results of regmatches into a new column in lieu of mapply, please let me know.  I cannot use stringr or other packages (school assignment).  </p>  <pre><code>require("tm") tweets &lt;- VCorpus(DirSource("C:/...../reviews"))  all.tweets &lt;-   data.frame(text=unlist(sapply(tweets,'[',"content")),stringsAsFactors=F)  data &lt;- all.tweets[10:15,]  index.list &lt;- mapply(regexpr, "(?&lt;=Review of )(\\w+ )+(?=-\\s*   [A-Z])", data, perl=T)) rest.names &lt;- mapply(regmatches, data, index.list) </code></pre>
