<p>I am writing a HTML document with knitr. My settings are: </p>  <pre><code>--- fontsize: 12pt  output:   html_document:     fig_height: 7     fig_width: 9     keep_md: yes     smart: no ---  ```{r global_options, include = FALSE} knitr::opts_chunk$set(comment = NA) ``` </code></pre>  <p>I have a few code chunks that produce figures. Each of these chunks produces a single figure. I label the chunks with the understanding that, when I knit the document, the chunk labels become the file-names of the figures. For example, the chunk that I label "mtcar_histogram" should produce the file "mtcar_histogram.png".</p>  <p>But when I navigate to the "figure-html" sub-directory of the directory containing my document, I see that all the figures have an automatic numerical suffix. For example, I see "mtcar_histogram-1.png" instead of "mtcar_histogram.png". </p>  <p>When I checked the <a href="http://yihui.name/knitr/options/" rel="nofollow">knitr options documentation</a>, I read that:</p>  <p>"Note any number of plots can be recorded in a single code chunk, and this package does not need to know how many plots are in a chunk in advance -- it can figure out automatically, and name these images as fig.path-label-i where i is incremental from 1"</p>  <p>But as I stated earlier, none of my chunks produce multiple plots, so the numbering is un-necessary for me.</p>  <p>Is there a means of dis-abling the numbering?      </p>
