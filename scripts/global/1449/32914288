<p>I am writing VBA for a file at work and need to do something a little odd.  I need to highlight the row (not the entire row, just the used part of the row) if the cell in Column J contains a certain value.  I have figured everything out except my code is highlighting the entire row, and I only want it to highlight the used cells in that row.  Can anyone advise?  Code below</p>  <pre><code>'Yellow Highlight..........THIS IS HIGHLIGHTING THE WHOLE ROW....WHY!!!!! WHY!!!!!!!!!!! Sheets("EMM").Activate     With Sheets("EMM")         For Lrow = 1 To ActiveSheet.UsedRange.Rows.Count                 With .Cells(Lrow, "J")                     If Not IsError(.Value) Then                         If .Value = "Desk to adjust" Then                             .EntireRow.Interior.ColorIndex = 6                         End If                     End If                 End With         Next Lrow     End With </code></pre>
