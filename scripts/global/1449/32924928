<p>I'm working on a project and need some advice. I'm trying to build an Invoice Maker for a friend in Excel. I'm using some VBA so he can select the items he's wants to add to an invoice and then will build the invoice based on his selection and export to PDF. The problem I'm having is that he has some extremely long descriptions for each part number that extend past the max row height (409). When I export to PDF, it only exports what is visible in the cell. I know I can merge cells to overcome this requirement, but was wondering if there is another solution.</p>  <p>Any suggestions on storing the descriptions in another file (non-Excel) and referencing them when building the PDF?</p>
