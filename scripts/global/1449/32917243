<p>Hi StackOverflow community:</p>  <p>I'd like to loop through the same column on three specific sheets in my workbook. I understand there needs to be something along the lines of code similar to what's been posted <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20422356/loop-through-excel-sheets">here</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31637316/loop-through-excel-sheets-in-a-single-workbook">here</a>, but I can't seem to get them to work and instead receive the error '1004', "Application-defined or object-defined error". </p>  <p>Additional notes: I entered "For each ws in this Workbook.sheets" after the declarations, and "Next" at the very end before "End Sub". I also tried the processing code after "r=1" in the code below and received the same 1004 error.  I tried this with "Next" after the loop code and it still only looped through the first sheet.</p>  <p>This is the code:</p>  <pre><code>Sub MakeWordList() Dim InputSheet As Worksheet Dim WordListSheet As Worksheet Dim PuncChars As Variant, x As Variant Dim i As Long, r As Long Dim txt As String Dim wordCnt As Long Dim AllWords As Range Dim PC As PivotCache Dim PT As PivotTable      Application.ScreenUpdating = False     Set InputSheet = ActiveSheet     Set WordListSheet = Worksheets.Add(after:=Worksheets(Sheets.Count))     WordListSheet.Range("A1") = "All Words"     WordListSheet.Range("A1").Font.Bold = True     InputSheet.Activate     wordCnt = 2     PuncChars = Array(".", ",", ";", ":", "'", "!", "#", _         "$", "%", "&amp;", "(", ")", " - ", "_", "--", "+", _         "=", "~", "/", "\", "{", "}", "[", "]", """", "?", "*")     r = 1   '   Loop until blank cell is encountered     Do While Cells(r, 7) &lt;&gt; "" '       covert to UPPERCASE         txt = UCase(Cells(r, 7)) '       Remove punctuation         For i = 0 To UBound(PuncChars)             txt = Replace(txt, PuncChars(i), "")         Next i '       Remove excess spaces         txt = WorksheetFunction.Trim(txt) '       Extract the words         x = Split(txt)         For i = 0 To UBound(x)             WordListSheet.Cells(wordCnt, 1) = x(i)             wordCnt = wordCnt + 1         Next i     r = r + 1     Loop  '   Create pivot table     WordListSheet.Activate     Set AllWords = Range("A1").CurrentRegion     Set PC = ActiveWorkbook.PivotCaches.Add _         (SourceType:=xlDatabase, _         SourceData:=AllWords)     Set PT = PC.CreatePivotTable _         (TableDestination:=Range("C1"), _         TableName:="PivotTable1")     With PT         .AddDataField .PivotFields("All Words")         .PivotFields("All Words").Orientation = xlRowField     End With  End Sub </code></pre>  <p>Is there any way I can loop through my first three sheets or identify the sheets I want to loop through? Specifically, I'd like to loop through column G of each of the first three sheets. </p>
