<p>I have a single cell that uses data validation. When a user selects a new value in that cell, I need 2 specific pivot tables to refresh, not all of them. Here's my code:</p>  <pre><code>Sub Update_Pivots(ByVal Target As Range) If Target.Address = Worksheets("Expense by Individual").Range("A3") Then    Worksheets("Expense by Individual").PivotTables("PivotTable2").PivotCache.Refresh    Worksheets("Expense Pivot").PivotTables("PivotTable3").PivotCache.Refresh End If End Sub </code></pre>  <p>When I compile this, I don't get errors, but when I change the target cell, the pivot tables do not refresh. Right now this is written as a general module, but I also tried putting under the specific sheet the target is found on (I don't know if this makes a difference, but I thought I'd mention it). Where am I going wrong?</p>  <p>Upated code:</p>  <pre><code>Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal Target As Range) If Target.Address = Worksheets("Expense by Individual").Range("A3").Address Then    Worksheets("Expense by Individual").PivotTables("PivotTable2").RefreshTable    Worksheets("Expense Pivot").PivotTables("PivotTable3").RefreshTable End If End Sub </code></pre>
