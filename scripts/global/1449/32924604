<p>I have some standardized processes in my macros to apply changes to a bunch of files placed in any directory, and I don't know why I get different results. To illustrate, this is the beginning of the standard code:</p>  <pre><code>'list files in the folder where this macro is placed strNombreCarpeta = ThisWorkbook.Path ChDir strNombreCarpeta strArchivoExcel = Dir("*." &amp; CStr(strExtension))  'rest of the code </code></pre>  <p>Even if my working directory is in another drive (not "C:"), I can get the for 'strNombreCarpeta' variable, content as 'E:/updating/12_06_files/' and process the files on that folder.</p>  <p>But, working with the same macro file in another PC, that process simply doesn't work, the variable 'strNombreCarpeta' gets a null value, and, the "Dir" command works as is my default path was %CURRENT_USER%/DOCUMENTS and tries to list the files on that folder.</p>  <p>So, I don't get any changes in the files I want.</p>  <p>Some idea why this change of drive works only sometimes? How can I prevent that?</p>  <p>Working always in "C:" is not a standard solution, because the space in drive is limited.</p>
