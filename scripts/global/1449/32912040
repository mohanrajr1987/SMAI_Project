<p>Suppose I have an Excel workbook (.xlsx / .xlsm) with the following two sheets (simplified for example's sake):</p>  <p><strong>Sheet 1:</strong></p>  <pre><code>Student_Id:    Name:    Age:    Sex:     ... 1              Bobby    10      Male     ... 2              Suzy     11      Female   ... 3              Mike     10      Male     ... 4              Sally    9       Female   ...  .... </code></pre>  <p><strong>Sheet 2:</strong></p>  <pre><code>Class:    Student_Id: Math      1 Math      2 Math      4 English   3 English   4   .... </code></pre>  <hr>  <p>Now, I would like to create an output sheet which is a mixture of the two, looking something along the lines of:   </p>  <p><strong>Output:</strong></p>  <pre><code>Class:    Name:    Age:    Sex:     ... Math      Bobby    10      Male     ... Math      Suzy     11      Female   ... Math      Sally    9       Female   ... English   Mike     10      Male     ... English   Sally    9       Female   ...  .... </code></pre>  <hr>  <p>Now, I know this is fairly easy to do using <code>VLOOKUP</code>s and <code>INDEX</code>, <code>MATCH</code> functions and I've already done that, but my question is whether there's a better feature existing in Excel to accomplish this.</p>  <p>I'm thinking of just using ADO to query the two sheets and output it, but I'm just feeling convinced there has to be a better way / built in feature.</p>  <p><strong>Extra notes:</strong></p>  <ol> <li><p>My data doesn't need to be live - meaning that it doesn't need to be formulas that will slow down Excel - which I know I can do with Copy / Paste Special, Values.</p></li> <li><p>I know of Power Query, but I'm trying not to use something that will require my users to install an add-in (but macros within the workbook would be ok).</p></li> </ol>
