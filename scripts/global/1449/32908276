<p>I have a table in Excel, that is set up as follows; <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8UVVJ.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8UVVJ.jpg" alt="tABLE LAYOUT"></a></p>  <p>What I need to be able to do, is on another sheet, based on the value of a drop down box where the person's name is selected (i.e. Test 1, Test 2, etc...), perform a lookup against the table and in the cell next to the drop down return the headers where the value in the Cell is Y.</p>  <p>For example, based on the table above, If Test 1 was selected from the drop down then the value returned should be </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Skill 1, Skill 4</p> </blockquote>  <p>Any advice on this would be much appreciated. I have tried to follow the instructions in the answer on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31858439/formula-to-search-table-and-return-multiple-column-headers">this post</a> but have been unsuccessful.</p>
