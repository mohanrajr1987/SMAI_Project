<p>I know that I can copy a column containing evaluated formulas, paste it into an adjacent column, and specify to paste values (i.e., a text string), so that the value sticks and I can then select, copy, and edit the value text as I desire.  However, I would like a more direct way to produce an editable column of values.  </p>  <p>In order of preference, I would be satisfied if I could either: </p>  <p>(1) simply <em>copy</em> the values directly from the formula-containing cells by specifying a copy mode/option instead of having to specify a paste mode/option (so that if I want to paste the values outside Excel, for example, I can do so directly) - I believe this is not possible but would like to know if I have overlooked something</p>  <p>(2) write the formulas in a way that "throws" the evaulated values to other cells, overwriting whatever is in those other cells as needed, but passing no trace of the formula itself to the other cells</p>  <p>(3) use a worksheet macro that runs in the background and automatically copies values from column A into column B whenever column A values are updated or</p>  <p>(4) perform some operation on the formula column that removes the formulas but leaves the (editable) values (with the obvious drawback that you can't reuse the formulas once they are gone).</p>  <p>Which of these are possible?  </p>
