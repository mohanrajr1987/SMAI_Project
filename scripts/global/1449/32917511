<p>Say I have the following data</p>  <p>......................Judge 1 | Judge 2 | Judge 3 | Total score</p>  <p>Contestant 1.......5.............3..............2 .......</p>  <p>Contestant 2.......3.............3..............6........</p>  <p>And I want to design some interface (I guess this could involve VBA, unless we can do without?) where I can select which judge's scores to add up. </p>  <p>So theoretically, there's a checklist where I have </p>  <p>[] Judge 1</p>  <p>[] Judge 2</p>  <p>[] Judge 3</p>  <p>[] Select all </p>  <p>Or something, and then if I press select all, the total score would sum up all the judge's scores. But if I unselect select all and just select Judge 1 and 2, then the scores would total up accordingly. </p>  <p>Any suggestions? </p>
