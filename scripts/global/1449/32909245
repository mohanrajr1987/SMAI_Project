<p>I am generating Excel PowerView dashboards. I thought it would be useful for users that only want a quick view to see a screenshot of the dashboard, with a link where more analytical people can download the excel file to repivot or drill down to their heart's contentment. </p>  <p>I found a macro that allows me to capture the screenshot and save it to a local file, but the screenshot is my entire desktop, or active application. Both of these look terrible, I need to capture ONLY the PowerView (see image below): <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/rNdi0.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/rNdi0.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Is there any way to capture only certain parts of the screen from VBA?</p>
