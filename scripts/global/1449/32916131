<p>I'm trying to make a function that not only substitute one text with another, but substitute a set of values from a range with another lateral set of values.</p>  <p>I have this:</p>  <pre><code>Public Function SubstituteRange(RangeWithText As Range, TwoColumnMatrix As Range) As String Dim Text As String Text = "/" &amp; RangeWithText.Value &amp; "/" 'as example st like this: "/" &amp; "1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8" &amp; "/" = "/1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/" Dim SearchForRange As Range Set SearchForRange = TwoColumnMatrix.Columns(1) 'let us say "A1:A4" with /2/ /3/ /4/ /5/ in each cell     Dim ReplaceWithRange As Range Set ReplaceWithRange = TwoColumnMatrix.Columns(2) 'let us say "B1:B4" with /9/ /10/ /11/ /12/ in each cell Dim i As Integer SubstituteRange = Text For i = 1 To SearchForRange.Rows.Count '4 rows SubstituteRange = Application.WorksheetFunction.Substitute(SubstituteRange, _ SearchForRange.Item(i), ReplaceWithRange.Item(i)) Next i End Function </code></pre>  <p>but this return an "#Value!" error, can somebody help me with this ? I expected to get from this example something like "/1/9/10/11/12/6/7/8/" but I didn't get it. thank you in advance.</p>
