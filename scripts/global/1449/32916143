<p>I have 2 sheets, "Report" and "Data". In the "Data" sheet are values in column A as follows T-Shirt.Adidas.25.110 I need to take the raw data and input them into the "Report" Sheet as separate entities.</p>  <p>ex. Cell A1 will read "T-Shirt" Cell B1 will read "Adidas" </p>  <p>Here is what I have so far. Its a with statement but that will only work for one line. Im not sure how to loop it.</p>  <pre><code>Dim Cell As Object Dim Data As Range Dim Report As Range Set Report = Worksheets("Report").Range("A2", Range("A2").End(xlDown)) Set Data = Worksheets("Data").Range("A2", Range("A2").End(xlDown))  With Report     .Resize(1, 4) = Split(Worksheets("Data").Range("A2"), ".") End With </code></pre>  <p>The macro needs to work for any number of objects in the data sheet.  Thanks in advance!</p>
