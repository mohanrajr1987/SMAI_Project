<p>I"m trying too make a macro too delete all the special characters in a word Document, My basic reference too all the special characters I need to delete for work are :</p>  <p>SPECIAL CHARACTERS</p>  <p>• Time to produce</p>  <p>(8 CCR §9792.24. 3),</p>  <p>µ  (the ‘u’ is not a letter, it is actually a symbol ‘µ’) If it documented as “µgm” in the file, and the reviewer is dictating it as “units per gram, ” then put units per gram (note in file states µgm [microgram/mcg]).</p>  <p>Kienböck’s</p>  <p>· Pain interferes…</p>  <p>®</p>  <p>©</p>  <p>™</p>  <p>· Pain interferes…</p>  <p>*Postsurgical physical</p>  <p>antagonists, α-adrenergic, cholinergic receptor agonists, γ agonists, Voltaren® Gel</p>  <p>•Genotype 1 </p>  <p>treatment-naïve</p>  <p>≥ (add to autocorrect = greater than or equal to)</p>  <p>Any special characters found in above text are what I need removed from my word document at any given time and or replaced with their respective meaning &amp; = and,µ = micro etc, etc. I've tried researching too see if there are any out there but I can't seem too find any. I don't really have a set code as I'm a true novice. Any help on this would be greatly appreciated. This would be in Word 2013 or 2007, as I would send this macro for my coworkers as well.</p>
