<p>I now receive an error message which says Compile Error: Next Without For - I'm not sure what this means...I have checked the Ifs and End ifs </p>  <hr>  <p>Original Question:</p>  <p>I am new to VBA and i am finding If/Then statements difficult. I have tried to create this, but i am not sure if this is the correct way. </p>  <p>I appreciate any help/suggestions to help me understand this a little better.</p>  <p>What i would like to do is create an If statement for a User Defined Field Column in Outlook. I have created a User defined field column called "Overdue". </p>  <p>I want to create an if then statement where, if an email is selected and has the value of "A" in UDF 2 and the flag status is not marked as complete; then there is a timer of 4 hours for this task to be completed- but the task timer should start as soon as the mail item reaches the mailbox. </p>  <p>If this is not overdue, then Column "Overdue"(UDF4) will stay as "No", if this is Overdue; >4 hours, this column will be set as the value "Yes" </p>  <p>Below is the code that i have been working on. I believe that there must be quite a lot of errors in this as i am missing a few statements. </p>  <pre><code>  For Each msg In myCollection    If msg.FlagStatus = olFlagComplete Then    End If      If str2 = "A" + TaskDueDate = ReceivedTime &gt; 4 Then 'check if received time is &gt; than 4 hours      ''''If Hour (?)()) &lt; 4 Then (comment:alt line of code)     msg.str4 = "Yes" 'if the received time for that message is more than 4 hours set Overdue column to say Yes     Set objProperty = msg.UserProperties(udf(4))      If TaskDueDate = ReceivedTime &lt; 4 Then     msg.str4 = "No"         Set objProperty = msg.UserProperties(udf(4))      If (objProperty Is Nothing) Then        Set objProperty = msg.UserProperties.Add(udf(4), olKeywords)   End If      objProperty.value = "No"`       msg.Save      Next      End If          End If     End Sub </code></pre>
