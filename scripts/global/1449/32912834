<p>I have an field with a name of <code>merchandise_id</code>. I'd like to use this value in the field for the SQL for another field called <code>orientations</code> which shows a combo box.</p>  <p>This is my sql for the row source for the combo box field, but shows all the orientations, not just those for the merchandise_id</p>  <pre><code>SELECT orientations.id, orientations.title    FROM orientations    WHERE [orientations].[merchandise_id]=[merchandise_id]  </code></pre>  <p>How can I use the field value in this sql query?</p>
