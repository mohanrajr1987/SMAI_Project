<p>I would like to export data from a consolidated sheet (DATA) to multiple sheets regarding criteria. I have a total of 13 criteria, each criteria has to be exported in its dedicated sheet.</p>  <p>I'm trying to optimize this macro (only 2 criteria here) because it lag out</p>  <pre><code>Sub copy()  Application.ScreenUpdating = False  Dim i As Long Dim j As Long  Dim sh As Worksheet Dim feuillePrincipale As Worksheet Dim S01Sheet As Worksheet Dim S02Sheet As Worksheet Set feuillePrincipale = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("DATA") Set S01Sheet = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("S01") Set S02Sheet = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("S02")  For Each sh In ThisWorkbook.Worksheets If sh.Name = "S01" Then i = 2 j = 2     While Not IsEmpty(feuillePrincipale.Cells(i, 1))         If feuillePrincipale.Cells(i, 11).Value Like "S01*" Then         feuillePrincipale.Cells.Rows(i).EntireRow.copy S01Sheet.Rows(j)         j = j + 1         End If     i = i + 1     Wend  End If  If sh.Name = "S02" Then i = 2 j = 2     While Not IsEmpty(feuillePrincipale.Cells(i, 1))         If feuillePrincipale.Cells(i, 11).Value Like "S02*" Then         feuillePrincipale.Cells.Rows(i).EntireRow.copy S02Sheet.Rows(j)         j = j + 1         End If     i = i + 1     Wend End If  Next  Application.ScreenUpdating = True  End Sub </code></pre>  <p>If you have any idea, I read I can use Advanced filter but as you guess I'm new in VBA so I'm listening any tips!</p>
