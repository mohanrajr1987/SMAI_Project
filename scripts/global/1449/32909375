<p>I am trying to write a code that will save my worksheet with the title "EMM POS Breaks TD <em>last Business day</em>.... so for instance today I would need it to save as "EMM POS Breaks TD 10.01.15" ... I found some code online and it is saving properly and the date function is working, but it is not saving the workbook as an excel file.  Can anyone please shed some light on what I can do?  Thanks!</p>  <pre><code>'x = Weekday(Today, vbSunday) 'Select Case x '    Case 1 '        x = 2 '    Case 2 '        x = 3 '    Case Else '    x = 1 'End Select 'ActiveWorkbook.SaveAs Filename:="EMM Position Breaks TD " &amp; _ '    Format(Date - x, "mm.dd.yyyy") &amp; " ", FileFormat:=xlNormal, Password:="", _ '    WriteResPassword:="", ReadOnlyRecommended:=False, CreateBackup:=False </code></pre>
