<p>As the subject line states, I am trying to store objects of a class I wrote into an Array.  VBA is giving me the frustrating error:</p>  <p>'Object Variable or With Block variable not set'</p>  <p>I'm pretty sure I am defining my object correctly, and the local variables show that the object is of my defined type and all of it's fields are filled in, so I can't figure out where my issue is.</p>  <pre><code>Dim Type1(2 To 250) As myClass Dim Type2(2 To 250) As myClass Dim Type3(2 To 250) As myClass Dim temp_obj As myClass Dim foo As String  For i = 2 To 250     Set temp_obj = New myClass     With temp_obj         .field1 = Worksheets("Sheet1").Rows(i).Columns(2).Value         .field2 = Worksheets("Sheet1").Rows(i).Columns(3).Value         .field3 = Worksheets("sheet1").Rows(i).Columns(4).Value         .field4 = Worksheets("Sheet1").Rows(i).Columns(5).Value     End With     foo = Worksheets("Sheet1").Rows(i).Columns(1).Value     If foo = "Type1" Then         Type1(i) = temp_obj     ElseIf foo = "Type2" Then         Type2(i) = temp_obj     ElseIf foo = "Type3" Then         Type3(i) = temp_obj     End If Next i </code></pre>  <p>My class looks something like this:</p>  <pre><code>Private pfield1 As Single Private pfield2 As Integer Private pfield3 As String Private pfield4 As String  Public Property Get field1() As Single     field1 = pfield1  End Property  Public Property Get field2() As Integer     field2 = pfield2 End Property  Public Property Get field3() As String     field3 = pfield3 End Property  Public Property Get field4() As String     field4 = pfield4 End Property  Public Property Let field1(p As Single)     pfield1 = p End Property  Public Property Let field2(p As Integer)     pfield2 = p End Property  Public Property Let field3(p As String)     pfield3 = p End Property  Public Property Let field4(p As String)     pfield4 = p End Property </code></pre>
