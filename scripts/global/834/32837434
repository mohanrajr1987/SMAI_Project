<p>I am currently working on a school management system but can't seem to figure out the best way to design my student attendance table.</p>  <p><strong>INFO</strong></p>  <p>School is for 14 weeks and class holds 5 times a week. Students in the school can be up to 2000 per term. Meaning attendance can be up to <code>14 x 5 x 2000 = 140, 000</code> per term.</p>  <p>I am developing the application for a desktop using <code>VB.Net</code> and <code>MS Access</code>.</p>  <p><strong>PROGRESS SO FAR</strong></p>  <p>I have so far designed something that I am skeptic about.</p>  <p>table name: attendance</p>  <pre><code>_____________________________________________ | id |std_id | att_week | att_date |  status | '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''' | 1  | 0001  |    1     |29/9/2015 |  yes    | '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''' | 2  | 0002  |    1     |29/9/2015 |  yes    | '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''' </code></pre>  <p>I easily found out that designing it like this can easily yield <code>140, 000</code> rows in a term.</p>  <p>I also thought of making the week days as column names, that will easily result in <code>14 x 5 = 70 columns</code>.</p>  <p>What is the best way to design this said table.</p>
