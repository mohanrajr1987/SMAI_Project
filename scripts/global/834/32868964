<p>I need a word that covers both schema and data.</p>  <p>I'm designing some classes that are part of a system that needs to store and process data that will only be defined at run time. I have some classes that contain a definition objects, and a storage objects.</p>  <p>This is going into a refactor of a core section a code base that has been going strong for 15 years, lots of people will need to use and understand the source code, so i'd like to do what i can to make it easy to understand. A group of us a have haggled and sweated over the design, but no-one has come up with a name for the classes:</p>  <p>I feel:</p>  <pre><code>[Unknown Word] | |______schema |______data  </code></pre>  <p>is what we are looking for</p>  <p>but</p>  <pre><code>data | |______schema |______storage </code></pre>  <p>is the best so far.</p>
