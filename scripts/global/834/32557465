<p>I develop an app using Yii2 platform and sql server database.</p>  <p>In database, I have some tables with prefix name 'M_' and some others with 'T_' to separate which tables used for backend/master and frontend.</p>  <p>I meant to get the tables name only the tables with prefix 'M_' using Yii2 class Schema (yii\db\schema). </p>  <p>my recently code for sure will return all the tables name </p>  <pre><code>$db_connection = Yii::$app-&gt;db; $dbSchema = $db_connection-&gt;schema; $tables = $dbSchema-&gt;getTableNames(); foreach($tables as $tbl){     //echo $tbl; } </code></pre>  <p>I maybe can use the strpos function to get tables name i need.</p>  <p>But any of you have an better way/idea to get through this?</p>
