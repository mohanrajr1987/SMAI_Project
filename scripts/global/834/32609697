<p>I've been reading up on XML et al but I'm just not seeing the big picture.</p>  <p>I'm writing an application which needs to submit XML (OAGIS BODS), to our middleware (INFOR ION) for processing. Much as I've tried there's no 'get me started' or best practice guide for what I want to do.</p>  <p>I have been given a 'golden' sample of a populated XML and told which tags and attributes I should replace (or add to) when I create an instance of my own XML. In essence this golden sample is the only documentation I have! The sample is just a file I've been given and so is just a snapshot of the XML when I received it.</p>  <p>At the crudest level, I could just use XMLreader and XMLwriter to trawl through my golden sample and modify/add to any XML I'm interested in. Great! It works, but I can't help thinking this is all wrong. Most significantly because, I suspect the schema used for the XML could change without notice and my code would not honour these changes. The middleware however would honour the schema and would reject my populated sample as being invalid against it.</p>  <p>Here's my thinking on what I should REALLY be doing. Please could you tell me if I'm on the right lines or how I might better approach the problem?</p>  <p>As I see it, I should be somehow using the schema to drive the creation and population process, thus keeping my XML up-to-date and compliant. The schema should be my friend, but I'm not quite sure how. I feel I should somehow be reading the schema to dynamically create objects with methods and properties such that I can only ever populate with 'syntactically' correct tags and attributes. So my pseudo code would read something like:</p>  <p>dim x as new XMLfromSchema("<a href="http://someplace...xsd" rel="nofollow">http://someplace...xsd</a>")</p>  <p>x.purchaseOrderNumber = "REQ000001"</p>  <p>x.purchaseItem(1).desc = "New Pen"</p>  <p>x.purchaseItem(1).price = 2.99</p>  <p>x.purchaseItem(2).desc = "XML Spy"</p>  <p>x.purchaseItem(2).price = 500.00</p>  <p>x.saveXML("c:\rats.xml")</p>  <p>In accordance with the schema, the XMLfromSchema class may well raise errors when I fail to populate any fields without defaults or give invalid data.</p>  <p>It seems xsd.exe (now paste special in VS2012+) and XML Spy could create these classes, but they're not dynamic.</p>  <p>I suppose I'm asking. Should I be crude and just code up every node and attribute disregarding the schema as I go? Or is there a better way?</p>  <p>By the way, I'm coding in Lotus Notes, but I'm happy to get confortable creating XMLs in VS to begin with (where the tools will be superior).</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
