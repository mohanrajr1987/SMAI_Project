<p>So I want to create a database link in oracle, my username is jefferson and I want to connect trough opms so I was told to do this. </p>  <pre><code>create  database link  tmpp connect to jefferson[opms] identified by nothing using $something ; </code></pre>  <p>For some reason when I try to use [] syntax it just tells me indentified is missing. Why is this not working, I was told to do it this way but I can't find any help in the official documentation for [] usage or the correct syntax. </p>
