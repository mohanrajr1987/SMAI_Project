<p>As the title entails, is this possible? </p>  <p>Using the following code returns a list of the built-in schemas as well as all the other schemas:</p>  <pre><code>select name from MyDbName.sys.schemas </code></pre>  <p>What I want is only the schemas I created for each table. I also tried doing the following code but its not very solid.</p>  <pre><code>select name from MyDbName.sys.schemas where name not like '%db_%' </code></pre>
