<p>I am using parse.com for the backend of my new iOS/android game. The way users join games is they select the type of lobby they want to join, for example:</p>  <p>Apple</p>  <p>Orange</p>  <p>Lemon</p>  <p>The user would select one of the lobby types, and the app will query for lobbies of that type with LESS THAN 4 users in it (Array of users). If it finds one, it will add the user to it, if not I will create a new lobby with the user as the first person in the lobby.</p>  <p>My question is how do I ensure that, however unlikely, when 2 users both search for the "Apple" lobby, and an object with 3 users is returned, they both don't get added into the lobby? I need to ensure that the game stays at 4 players or less, and that only one of them gets added to the lobby, and the next one gets added to a new lobby. Is there a way to check if another user is currently modifying an object? What would be the best way to go about this?</p>
