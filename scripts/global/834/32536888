<p>I am working on two schemas in an Oracle database, say Schema A and Schema B. I am given a task of moving all the user objects in schema A to Schema B. Some of the objects (more than 200) including procedures, functions, tables and indexes have common names in both the schemas. Among the objects with common names, few are exactly similar in both definition and quite a lot have different definitions. Some of these objects in both the schemas are being called from Java layer of the application.</p>  <p>I was thinking I would declare synonyms for all the common objects in schema A and then test if my application is working properly and once this process is done make changes to the objects with common names in schema B where ever applicable and then alter my synonyms to point to objects in schema B and test again.Is there any better way to go about with this task?</p>  <p>Thanks a lot in advance.</p>
