<p>I am a beginner, and know nothing about coding. I started an online business in Jan. of 2015. An SEO expert suggested implementing Schema into my website. Now that I am trying to insert Schema into my product listings it changes my SEO score (WooCommerce SEO Plugin) from green to yellow and when I insert Schema the content is put into a white box that looks absolutely terrible on the website seeing that the background color is orange. I contacted Schema.org and they sent me to this forum. I am hoping someone can help me.</p>  <p>My website is: www.giannettiartisans.com My email is: giannetti.export@gmail.com</p>
