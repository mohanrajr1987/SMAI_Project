<p>I am trying to edit PostgreSQL schema script and make it executable in Oracle (Oracle Express). In PostgreSQL were under the each CREAT TABLE these commands: </p>  <pre><code>ALTER TABLE table_name OWNER TO user; </code></pre>  <p>For example table_name is <em>appuser</em> and user is <em>projectX</em>.</p>  <p>The table is successfully created, but there is an error: ORA-01735: invalid ALTER TABLE option</p>  <p>I have also created another user in my scheme (projectX), but the error is still there. So I am confused. Does this command ALTER TABLE table_name OWNER TO user; even exists in Oracle database?</p>
