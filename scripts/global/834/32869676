<p>If I have a file/folder and I want have different users be able to access it... i.e Folder one can be accessed by J, K and M....</p>  <p>Should the file/folder have its own table with a list of users who can access it, or should each user have a list of files/folders they can access.</p>  <p>I want to bare in mind extensibility when it comes to the database.  I just cant see which would be the best thing to do.</p>
