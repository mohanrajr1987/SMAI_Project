<p>I would like to ask a question about an exercise statement. The exercise is about creating the XML Schema from an XML file. Basically i have an account element and two types of accounts; checking accounts and saving accounts.</p>  <p>Among others requirement, it have to : "Use inheritance for checking and savings accounts by deriving from a common account type".</p>  <p>I'm not sure to understand the sentence. What does it means by inheritance ?  I have two hypothesis about what does it means.</p>  <p>1) The exercise wants me to use xs:extension in checking and saving elements.</p>  <p>2) Something more like this :</p>  <pre><code> &lt;xs:element name="accounts"&gt;      &lt;xs:complexType&gt;        &lt;xs:sequence&gt;          &lt;xs:element name="savings_accounts"&gt;            &lt;!-- content of saving accounts --&gt;          &lt;/xs:element&gt;           &lt;xs:element name="checking_accounts"&gt;            &lt;!-- content of checking accounts --&gt;          &lt;/xs:element&gt;        &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;     &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;  &lt;/xs:element&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I'm not sure I understood the question, which hypothesis was the correct interpretation ?</p>
