<p>I've just finished two days of agile/scrum coaching at work which was great. I'm a a novice to professional programming so I needed it. However, I'm struggling very much with the notion of vertical slicing. In particular I cannot see how a database schema can emerge from several developers working separately across all development tiers (front middle and back)? Designing the database schema all in one go is called horizontal slicing and it's considered a no-no. I'm familiar with object relational mapping - slightly - from having worked with frameworks like Grails. But again, I still designed the schema first and worked from there. </p>  <p>To be clear, I am not arguing against the case for agile/scrum/vertical slicing, rather I am asking how it is possible? - in particular when it comes the mapping of objects the the database schema, how can this be done by several developers in tandem and not from the beginning?</p>  <p>This article which i really like seems to - if i've read it correctly - suggest that the database schema should be designed in the spring planning stage before any user stories are implemented.<a href="http://www.vertabelo.com/blog/notes-from-the-lab/data-modeling-in-agile-development-one-data-modelers-experience" rel="nofollow">http://www.vertabelo.com/blog/notes-from-the-lab/data-modeling-in-agile-development-one-data-modelers-experience</a></p>
