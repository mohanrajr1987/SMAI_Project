<p>I'm very new with mongodb was reading some examples about relations but still can get into it, maybe because I was stack with sql for too long. So I have a table Clients, and table Users I've red that in MongoDB I can do embed something like this</p>  <pre><code>db.clients.findOne() {   id  : '1',   name: 'Client',   users : [      { name: 'User 1', id: '1' },      { name: 'User 2', id: '2' }   ] } </code></pre>  <p>or  two separated tables</p>  <pre><code>  clients : [      { name: 'User 1', id: '1'}   ]  And    users : [      { name: 'User 1', id: '1', clientId:'1'  },      { name: 'User 2', id: '2', clientId:'1'  }   ] </code></pre>  <p>Assuming that clients &amp; users would be a lot as entries which way is better? Thank you in advance.</p>
