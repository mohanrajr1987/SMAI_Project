<p>I had made a GUI for my project using Ubuntu's <strong>Quickly</strong>. When I run the app in root using command <code>quickly run</code>, I get the following error</p>  <blockquote>   <p>GLib-GIO-ERROR *: Settings schema 'org.gnome.desktop.interface' is not   installed".</p> </blockquote>  <p>However the app runs fine when it is not in root. But my project further requires to open a device, which fails if it is not in root.</p>  <p>So my problem here is to remove the above error while running <strong>Quickly</strong> app in root.</p>  <p>Any advice would be very helpful.</p>
