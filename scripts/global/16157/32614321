<p>The :hover CSS pseudo-class doesn't work well on touch devices. The hover state tends to stick until something else is touched.  So in our web apps, we use Modernizr to detect browsers/devices with touch capability, and we disable hover states in those cases:</p>  <p>.no-touch .button:hover { ... }</p>  <p>This becomes a problem on a hybrid device that supports both a touchscreen and a pointer device, such as a mouse or touchpad. Modernizr detects that it is touch-enabled and none of the hover states work when using the mouse.</p>  <p>What would be more useful is to detect the presence of the mouse or other pointer device instead of the touchscreen. But I am unable find find anything like this.</p>  <p>Any suggestions?  </p>
