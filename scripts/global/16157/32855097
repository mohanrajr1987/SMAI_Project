<p>I am looking at using WPF to develop a full screen desktop application with some touch screen elements. When I drag my finger across the application in full screen, Windows 8.1 allows me to pull the app down a little and peek behind the app to see behind it. The amount of the peek is rather small, only enough to see a title bar of the app behind it.</p>  <p>An example is to create a full screen WPF app with a <code>ListView</code>, then set <code>ScrollViewer.CanContentScroll="False"</code>. This gives you smooth scrolling via touch.</p>  <p>If I pull down towards the bottom and I'm at the top of list (simulates scrolling to top of the list), the top of app is pulled down to reveal the desktop behind.</p>  <p>If I pull up towards the the top and I'm at the end of the list (simulates scrolling to end of list), the bottoms of the app is exposed and the task bar appears.</p>  <p>Left to right and right to left do not do this. Only up and down swipes.</p>  <p>Is this something that is embedded into windows or something I can control inside WPF?</p>
