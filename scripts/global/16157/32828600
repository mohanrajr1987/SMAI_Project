<p>I have an app written in VB for Winforms that is used on touch device. When i click buttons with mouse all is fine, but when i use touch and click really fast then app decides that i was clicking the same button twice! For ex. i have buttons A and B and if i click A->B fast i'll get AB using mouse and AA using touch.</p>  <p>That is weird. Code for button handling:</p>  <pre><code>Private Sub Click(sender As Object, e As Object) Handles A.MouseDown, B.MouseDown          SendKeys.Send(sender.text)         Debug.WriteLine(sender.text) End Sub </code></pre>  <p>How can i fix it? Thanks.</p>  <p>PS: It looks like sender.text values are the same though i click different buttons. If i click them slowly - all is fine.</p>  <p>PSS: The problem is that i even get the same coordinates for MousePosition when i touch it fast! Some touch specifics?</p>
