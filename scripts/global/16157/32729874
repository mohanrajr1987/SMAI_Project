<p>I have a ball on my game screen, and its just a png image. The issue is that it only detects me tapping the node when I tap in the png area outside the ball(still part of the picture). I want to be able to tap on the inside of the ball and I don't care about the outside. But right now it isn't detecting anything when I tap the part of the picture that actually has the photo on it. Anyone know how to fix? Code is below. Im a teen app developer and have been doing this for a few months so Im not an expert. Im also using swift btw.</p>  <pre><code>override func didMoveToView(view: SKView) {     /* Setup your scene here */     let ballTexture = SKTexture(imageNamed: "RoundBall.png")      ball = SKSpriteNode(texture: ballTexture)     ball.name = "ball"     ball.userInteractionEnabled = true      ball.size.height = CGFloat(35)     ball.size.width = CGFloat(35)      ball.physicsBody = SKPhysicsBody(circleOfRadius: ballTexture.size().height/80)     ball.physicsBody = SKPhysicsBody(circleOfRadius: ballTexture.size().width/80)     ball.physicsBody!.dynamic = true      ball.position = CGPoint(x: CGRectGetMidX(self.frame), y: CGRectGetMidY(self.frame)-15)      self.addChild(ball) } </code></pre>  <p>and</p>  <pre><code>override func touchesBegan(touches: Set&lt;UITouch&gt;, withEvent event: UIEvent?) {    /* Called when a touch begins */      for touch: AnyObject in touches {         let location = touch.locationInNode(self)     let body:SKPhysicsBody? = self.physicsWorld.bodyAtPoint(location)         print("see")     if body?.node?.name == ballCategoryName{         print("Ball Touched")         fingerOnBall = true     }   } } </code></pre>  <p>By the way, I said in the top of the scene that the ball is an SKSpriteNode. Please help!  Thank you so much for whoever is willing to spend their time helping me figure this out. Thanks</p>
