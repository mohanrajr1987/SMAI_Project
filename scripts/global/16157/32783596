<p>I am writing userscript for my personal enrichment to modify the Feedly category view page such as <a href="https://feedly.com/i/category/Noticias" rel="nofollow">https://feedly.com/i/category/Noticias</a> , if you have a category called Noticias already defined ). I believe this applies to all view formats, but I am using Cards view.</p>  <p>When you scroll down the articles a bit, there is a top bar called <code>#floatingBar</code> that gives you controls on the top for the entire category, such as marking all articles as read.</p>  <p>If you enable touch in chrome and then finger spread to zoom in, that bar will zoom along with the rest of the content, moving the control buttons out of view to the right. I need to defeat this behavior with CSS.</p>  <p>If instead you use <code>Ctl</code>+<code>+</code> to zoom in, the bar reformats correctly to keep the control icons visible. So this is a problem specific to chrome touch support.</p>  <p>the width is specified in pixels so I though if I change the <code>width</code> for <code>#floatingBar</code> to, for example, <code>85vw</code>, it might work. But it does not if I change the zoom again.</p>  <ol> <li>is there any CSS solution to this problem?</li> <li>if not, can someone help me poll the visible viewport and find the difference between that and the "window" width, using jquery to reset the width of <code>#floatingBar</code> as needed?</li> </ol>
