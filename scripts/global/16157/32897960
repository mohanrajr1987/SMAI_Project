<p>I'm developing a webapp and I've got a div inside of an iFrame that has hidden, overflowed content that I want to be scrollable.</p>  <p>On Safar on iOS 9 when I add <code>-webkit-overflow-scrolling:touch;</code> to the div (that already has <code>overflow-y: scroll;</code> to give the scroll a fluid feel, it breaks and doesn't scroll at all.</p>  <p>I know that this is a known issue but I haven't found solutions relevant to my scenario: I have iFrames that do more than transmit data, they actually contain content for the user. Orientation doesn't matter, the content will always need to be scrollable.</p>
