<p>JavaScript touch events contain properties for radius and force. Unfortunately it appears that events aren't generated when either property changes. Events are only triggered for things like touch start, move or end. Can anyone think of a way to get more updates on change of touch size?</p>  <p>Currently to get radius updates I have to wiggle my finger to trigger the touch move event, but I would prefer a software solution.</p>
