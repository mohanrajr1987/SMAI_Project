<p>I am currently trying to install <em>ZXY100 32 Input Controller Drivers</em> <a href="http://www.gieseke-buch.de/raspberrypi/sd-karte-vom-raspberry-pi-windows-vollstaendig-nutzen" rel="nofollow">Drivers</a> for a Zytronic touchpad on Raspbian. But the kernel states that modules are missing. I already tried the <strong>Adding 7inch display with touchscreen to Raspberry PI</strong> <a href="http://engineering-diy.blogspot.co.uk/2013/01/adding-7inch-display-with-touchscreen.html" rel="nofollow">tutorial</a> But it didn't work. Does anybody have done something like this before? A few tipps could be helpful. Thanks</p>
