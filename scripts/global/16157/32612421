<p>I have some special monitor which allows me to have touch input or input by special pen. This monitor can be used as extended monitor to another monitors. I want to programatically create window and programatically move it into this monitor. Then I want to use pen for drawing into this window. But I don't know how can I get handle of this special monitor (and position of monitor to other extended monitors), because I don't know how to recognize this monitor in all extended monitors. So I don't know where to move my window to get pen input.</p>  <p>I tried to use <code>EnumDisplayDevices()</code> but I don't have specific name for this monitor. Only that I know is that resolution of this monitor is 1024x768, but I can't use it because another monitors can have this resolution too.</p>  <p>Thanks for any idea.</p>
