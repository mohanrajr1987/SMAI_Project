<p>I am migrating classic ui dialogs to touch ui dialogs, I migrated the parent component dialog, I observed AEM is showing the parent dialogs tabs and properties in the child component as well. In the existing classic ui dialogs it doesnt inherit the parent properties whereas in the touch ui it does. </p>  <p>How can we achieve the same classic ui behavior in touch ui as well by preventing the dialog inheritance.</p>  <p>Please share details if anyone has information about this issue.  </p>
