<p>I created a SurfaceView where I have three circles (each one is an object, and all of them are stored in one array), the problem is that I don't know how to individually identify them when user touch.</p>  <p>I was thinking about doing a for loop to check one by one if it was pressed, but I think there must be a better way of doing this.</p>  <p>Could anyone help me?</p>  <p>Thank you in advance.</p>
