<p>I want to move an SKSpriteNode over the screen with touch. The issue I have is that if I lock onto one sprite and then my finger drags it over another sprite the first one is let go and my finger starts to drag the second one. But once I touch the first sprite this is the only one I want to move. There must be a simple way to resolve this? </p>  <pre><code>override func touchesBegan(touches: Set&lt;UITouch&gt;, withEvent event: UIEvent?) {     /* Called when a touch begins */     let touch: UITouch = touches.first as UITouch!     touchLocation = touch.locationInNode(self) }  override func touchesMoved(touches: Set&lt;UITouch&gt;, withEvent event: UIEvent?) {     let touch: UITouch = touches.first as UITouch!     let newTouchLocation = touch.locationInNode(self)     let targetNode = self.nodeAtPoint(touchLocation)     if targetNode.physicsBody!.categoryBitMask != PhysicsCategory.Ball {     targetNode.runAction(SKAction.moveBy(CGVector(point: newTouchLocation - touchLocation), duration: 0.0))     touchLocation = newTouchLocation     } }  override func touchesEnded(touches: Set&lt;UITouch&gt;, withEvent event: UIEvent?) {     //I don't do anything with this yet } </code></pre>
