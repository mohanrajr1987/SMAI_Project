<p>I have a Windows 10 laptop with a touchscreen and would like to develop Android applications in Unity.  My options for testing touch input seem to be:</p>  <ol> <li><p>Use <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityRemote4.html" rel="nofollow">Unity Remote 4</a>. Doesn't use my computer's touchscreen but shows my touch actions on a usb linked Android device on the computer screen. </p></li> <li><p>Use Visual Studioâ€™s Emulator for Android. Uses my touch screen if I develop with Visual Studio instead of Monodevelop, or publish/push the apk to the standalone version of the emulator. I can't post more than 2 links, search "visual studio emulator for android". </p></li> <li><p>Use <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2012/11/07/adding-multi-touch-support-in-unity-windows-apps" rel="nofollow">TouchScript</a>. Which may or may not work with Unity 5 or Windows 10. </p></li> </ol>  <p>Is anyone else using their computer's touchscreen for development?  Have you had success with one of the options I listed or are you using another method?</p>
