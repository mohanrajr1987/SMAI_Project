<p>Does anyone know if somewhere exist some kind of lib, that will allow me to detect different symbols? I mean - a package with ready algorithms. I saw some apps that were recognizing this kind of things.</p>  <p>If not, maybe someone will point a way, how to efficiently write an algorithm for detecting a star on the screen?</p>
