<p>Currently, I am working on VR application for android that using google CardBoard and Rajawali to play the 360 video. The sensor is working well, but I cannot use touch to drag the scene or camera around correctly. Is there any way to enable touch mode in this app?</p>  <p>Any help is greatly appreciated!  Thank you.</p>
