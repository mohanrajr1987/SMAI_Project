<p>So I'm using using <a href="http://imakewebthings.com/waypoints/" rel="nofollow">Waypoints</a> and it works fine. The only problem is that on iOS, the class get added at the right moment, but the element disappear until I stop scrolling. Then, the element reappear as position:fixed. In the inspector, when the element is invisible, I can clearly see the class and the position:fixed applied. </p>  <p>Anyway I could solve this ?</p>
