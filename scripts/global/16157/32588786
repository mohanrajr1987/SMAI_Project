<p>I want to display a modal when the user is attempting to access the address bar (exit intent). Since there is no sure way to detect this (security reasons) I am assuming when the user is existing the page from the top he/she will try to access the address bar.</p>  <p>There is a plugin for this called Ouibounce but it doesn't work on touch devices, so I looked for other solutions. Found this on another post on StackOverflow:</p>  <pre><code>$(document).on('mouseleave touchleave', function(e) {     if(e.clientY &lt; 0) {       alert('y u leave from the top?');     } }); </code></pre>  <p>It works great on desktop but not touch devices even though I have the <code>touchleave</code> event on there. Any idea how to get it to work?</p>
