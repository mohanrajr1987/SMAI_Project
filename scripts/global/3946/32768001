<p>Tkinter is automatically pasting text into an entry box when I right click inside of it.  The strange thing is, it pastes the name from a listbox item that has been selected, or the highlighted text of an entry box.  Here is how to replicate the issue:</p>  <p><strong>Case I</strong></p>  <p>After selecting an item from a list box, or generating the event <code>"&lt;&lt;ListboxSelect&gt;&gt;"</code>, right clicking in any entry box will paste the name of the most recently selected listbox item.  Problem resolves itself when you highlight some text, then unhighlight it.</p>  <p><strong>Case II</strong></p>  <p>If some text is already highlighted from an entry box, it will paste highlighted text when you right click on any other entry box.  Problem is resolved when text is unhighlighted.</p>  <p>After doing some research, I found an issue similar to mine <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14470286/disable-pasting-highlighted-text-when-a-right-click-action-is-made-in-tkinter-on" title="Disable pasting highlighted text when a right-click action is made in tkinter on OS X">over here</a>.  It appears this is an event that happens on OS X and not other systems (I could be mistaken, I primarily use Macintosh).  Is there a solution to this problem? I'm not too worried about my example in <em>case II</em>, but more so in <em>case I</em>.</p>  <p>Here is some code I wrote that replicates the problem:</p>  <pre><code>import tkinter as tk from tkinter import ttk  def generate_event(event=None):      root.event_generate("&lt;&lt;ListboxSelect&gt;&gt;")     list.select_set("end")     list.activate("anchor")  root = tk.Tk()  list = tk.Listbox(root) list.pack()  text_var = tk.StringVar()  # I used a StringVar because that is what is used in my original code. text_box = ttk.Entry(root, textvariable=text_var) text_box.pack()  button = ttk.Button(text="Press me!", command=generate_event) button.pack()  list.insert("end", "Test") list.insert("end", "Hello")  root.mainloop() </code></pre>  <p><strong>How I've Tried to Fix the Problem:</strong></p>  <p>I have tried clearing the clipboard using <code>clipboard_clear()</code>, but it seems the clipboard has nothing to do with the problem.  I have tried disabling <code>&lt;Button-2&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;Button-3&gt;</code> using <code>unbind_all()</code>.  I have even tried using the solution from the link provided above (I might not be implementing it right).</p>  <p>Python version: 3.4</p>  <p>OS: Yosemite</p>
