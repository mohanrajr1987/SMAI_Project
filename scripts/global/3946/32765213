<p>I have a listbox with many listboxitems inside. those items only contain text elements.  What I want to do is change the text style (and maybe the background colour as well) for a single listboxitem in c# code (as I need to apply conditions). how would I go about that?</p>  <p>XAML: </p>  <pre><code>&lt;ListBox x:Name="todoList" Margin="5, 5, 5, 5" Grid.Row="1" SelectionChanged="todoList_SelectionChanged"/&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I fill the listbox by parsing a file and then adding items to the listbox. </p>  <p>Subclassing the ItemControlStyleSelector did not seem to work in my case as you cannot overwrite the SelectStyle function in the UWP case. </p>  <p>I am able to apply a style to the WHOLE ListBox (all ListBoxItems) by: </p>  <pre><code>Style st = new Style(); st.TargetType = typeof(ListBoxItem); st.Setters.Add(new Setter(ListBoxItem.BackgroundProperty, "Blue")); todoList.ItemContainerStyle = st; </code></pre>  <p>What would a good approach be to change only one item's style in code? The goal is to apply some styling to certain items after the user pressed a specific button / key on the keyboard.</p>  <p>thanks!</p>
