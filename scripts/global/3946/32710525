<p>I have a full screen WPF application built for a touch monitor, and I have some ListBoxes on the main screen.</p>  <p>When I flick the <code>Listbox</code> it scrolls fine, but when it gets to the end of the list, the entire application gets pulled down from the top of the screen, But I need the inertia just for the list box not for the entire window. How I can achieve that?</p>
