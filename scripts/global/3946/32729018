<p>This is my first post so please be patient. Using C# I have a Windows form with a combo box and a list box and want to move items from one object to the other. I am trying to create a method where I can pass these objects and have an algorithm do the work based on which object is passed first. Here is what I have so far and the algorithm works elsewhere in my code (when I explicitly state Combobox1 instead of Obj1, or Listbox1 instead of Obj2) but I want to remove it from the methods its in and create its own method to allow for movement of list items for any type of object that holds list items, such as Listbox, Combobox, etc... Visual Studios is saying that Obj1 and Obj2 do not exist in the current context, I think because they are defined within the if block, but I'm not sure how to fix it. Any help is appreciated.</p>  <pre><code>private void UpdateSelectionListing(object MoveFilesTo, object MoveFilesFrom)     {         /* Identify what object will have items moved to,           * and what objects will have items moved from */          if (MoveFilesTo is ComboBox &amp;&amp; MoveFilesFrom is ListBox)             {                 ComboBox Obj1 = (ComboBox)MoveFilesTo;                 ListBox Obj2 = (ListBox)MoveFilesFrom;             }         else if (MoveFilesTo is ListBox &amp;&amp; MoveFilesFrom is ComboBox)             {                 ComboBox Obj2 = (ComboBox)MoveFilesTo;                 ListBox Obj1 = (ListBox)MoveFilesFrom;             }          for (int n = Obj1.Items.Count - 1; n &gt;= 0; --n)             {                 Obj2.Items.Add(Obj1.Items[n].ToString());                 Obj1.Items.RemoveAt(n);             }         }  </code></pre>
