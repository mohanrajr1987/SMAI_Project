<p>here some beginners question after 2 hours of googling.</p>  <p>I have got a WindowsForm named GUI with an listbox item (it not have to be a listbox)</p>  <p>What I want to realize is having a box in the GUI an send from every classes in my project text to that box.</p>  <p>Example: in Programm.cs I want simply write something like this GUI.WriteToLog("Hello World"); and it should appear in that box.</p>  <p>This GUI.WriteToLog should work in every class.</p>  <p>I tried to write a static function WriteToLog in the GUI class but if its static I cant use the listBox1 in that function.</p>  <pre><code>    public partial class GUI : Form {         public void WriteToLog(string msg)     {           listBox1.Items.Add(msg);      } } </code></pre>  <p>Here the class that should access the box:</p>  <pre><code>    class FileManager {          internal static void RenameFiles(string filePath)     {         GUI g = new GUI();         g.WriteToLog("Moving Files");         try {             File.Move(filePath, filePath + ".RDY");         }         catch (Exception e)         {             string message = e.ToString();             string caption = "Error";             MessageBox.Show(message, caption);         }      } </code></pre>  <p>EDIT:</p>  <p>More Details what I want to do: I have to access the ListBox from all of my classes, because it should inform about status. After some more google searches. I figured out that the best way to do this is to write an event ? I this right ? How du I do this ? Example what I want: GUI with the ListBox ... I'm in class "FileManager" Function "RenameFile" there I want write one line to the ListBox "Hey, I'm renaming files now" or I'm in Class "Communicator" in Function "SendEmail" so I want to add a line to the ListBox "Hey dude, I'm sending a fabilous email" ... </p>
