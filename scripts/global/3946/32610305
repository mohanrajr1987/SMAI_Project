<p>I found this question... <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26682659/easy-vba-looking-through-a-listbox-and-selecting-the-contents">EASY: vba: Looking through a listbox and selecting the contents</a> but it seems to select every item...not very useful.</p>  <p>I need to load a popup form's ListBox with the existing values already highlighted so that the user will be able to add or remove items.</p>  <pre><code>  For x = 1 To rs.RecordCount     For Each ItemIndex In lbFA.?????       If lbFA.ItemData(ItemIndex) = rs!FunctionalArea Then         lbFA.Selected(ItemIndex) = True       End If     Next y   Next x </code></pre>  <p>What goes in the <code>lbFA.?????</code> area?  I think that's the only part I missing.</p>
