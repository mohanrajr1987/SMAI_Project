<p>We are trying to solve a nagging problem of using the built in listbox pin wheel that's on iOS and other mobile devices. The list box on our mobile devices are so small and cuts of text if the words extended too far. However, I found within the Etsy mobile iOS app, they have this clever way of displaying a large list box. Please see the animated GIF I recorded and converted to demonstrate this concept.</p>  <p>As anyone seen this done with CSS &amp; jquery?</p>  <p>If you want to see a higher quality version of this video I made, please click here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nTWBJzayV4" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nTWBJzayV4</a></p>  <p>The closest concept I could find was this plugin: <a href="http://www.jqueryscript.net/demo/jQuery-Multi-Select-List-Box-Plugin-listbox-js/" rel="nofollow">http://www.jqueryscript.net/demo/jQuery-Multi-Select-List-Box-Plugin-listbox-js/</a></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/juIu2.gif" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/juIu2.gif" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
