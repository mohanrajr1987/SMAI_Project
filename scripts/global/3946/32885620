<p>I have an Object which has data in it, now I need to put that data into a ListBox.<br> What is the best way to do that. The data is a List but no matter what I do I can't get the List to go into the ListBox. I have read about ToString() but not sure how to do that. I know this is a little vague, but its the best I can do.</p>  <p>The CollectionClass creates a list which inputs the data into and Ingredient object, The I need to get the Ingredient object to display in the List  </p>  <pre><code>    CollectionClass newCollection = new CollectionClass();     public Form1()     {         InitializeComponent();         newCollection.createList();         List&lt;Ingredient &gt; myIngredientDisplay = new List&lt;Ingredient&gt;();           listBoxIngredients.DataSource = myIngredientDisplay;      } </code></pre>
