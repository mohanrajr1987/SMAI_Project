<p>I am trying to place the results from <code>ListBox1</code> to specific cells, <code>K29</code> to <code>K35</code>, in Worksheet <code>'Calculation Entry'</code>.  I have it so that one can highlight multiple selections, but I need to extract those selections and place them in the cells stated.</p>  <p>They are from a listbox populated by cells in another worksheet. I have the listbox created and populated, but am having trouble moving the text from the selected items to the cells listed above.</p>  <p>The help that I am looking for is the <code>VBA</code> code to tie to <code>ListBox1</code> that activates with <code>ListBox1_Click()</code>. </p>  <p>I have remedied this and am placing this code as per the request of a friend:</p>  <pre><code>Range("K27").Select  dim msg as String dim ary(100) as string ActiveCell.Clear  With ListBox1      For i = 0 To .ListCount - 1         If .Selected(i) Then             msg = msg &amp; .List(i) &amp; vbNewLine            ary(j) = .List(i)            j = j + 1         End If      Next i      Range("K27").Select      ActiveCell.Offset(rowOffset:=0, columnOffset:=0).Activate  End With  If msg = vbNullString Then     MsgBox "Nothing was selected! Are you sure that you don't want to replace any parts?!"    Exit Sub    Else Check = MsgBox("You selected:" &amp; vbNewLine &amp; msg &amp; vbNewLine &amp; "Are these selections correct?", vbYesNo + vbInformation, "Please confirm")  Worksheets("Calculation Entry").Activate ActiveCell.Value = msg   end if   </code></pre>
