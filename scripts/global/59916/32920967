<p>I use the following media query to apply my CSS overrides in fullscreen mode:</p>  <pre><code>@media (device-width: 100vw) and (device-height: 100vh) {   .content {     padding: 0px !important;   } } </code></pre>  <p>In works perfectly in Firefox but very unreliable in Chrome (both latest versions on Windows 7 x64). I can try to apply my overrides only when not in fullscreen mode but need to invert the query. So my questions are:</p>  <ol> <li>Should Chrome support the query?</li> <li>How do I invert it (logical not)?</li> </ol>
