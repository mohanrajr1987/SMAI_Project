<p>On my responsive Opencart site, when resizing our page between the widths 768px and 992px our logo pushes down and doesn't align.</p>  <p>I can fix this by making the top margin -23px. This of course breaks it out of this range.</p>  <p><strong>Can you set a media screen range in CSS so a setting is applied between 768px and 992px only?</strong></p>  <p>Our default CSS code  #logo {     margin: -30px 0 -2px -30px;</p>
