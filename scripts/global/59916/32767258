<p>When developing a website I often use background images for banners. When this website is in a CMS, the images paths come from the database (user uploaded). So I ended up using a <code>style="background-image:url(myImageFromDB.jpg)"</code></p>  <p>However, this becomes an issue when I want to replace this image with smaller versions of the same image.</p>  <p>A lot of tutorials/guides out there, assume that you already know the path to this image, so you can just use @media queries to easily replace them. But if the path is dynamic, then I can't use media queries (unless they are dynamically written in the head of the document).</p>  <p>So how are people dealing with this issue?</p>  <ol> <li>Not using background-images? (using  instead?)</li> <li>Dynamically writing media queries at the head of the document?</li> <li>Using JS to dynamically load the correct images?</li> <li>Resizing images dynamically on the server?</li> </ol>  <p>My downsides of each method: 1. Downside, can't use some good options such as background-size:cover 2. Need to write server side script figure out what image to load 3. Probably the best option, but need to wait for the JS to load first 4. I have tried this, but without much success.</p>
