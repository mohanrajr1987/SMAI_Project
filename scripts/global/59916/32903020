<p>I currently own an Galaxy S6 and iphone 5c. When I view my website on the Android everything looks responsive (besides the stuff I have to finish) but when I look at the website on my iPhone I get this terrible choppy cutoff on the banner below the Nav.</p>  <p><a href="http://imgur.com/wIg2TUZ" rel="nofollow">http://imgur.com/wIg2TUZ</a></p>  <p>I go to the Chrome Dev tools on my website and when I choose the Iphone 4/5/6 preview, it doesnt show up. Yet on my iPhone, and friends iPhone's this has shown up repeatedly. This happens on all the pages of my website. </p>  <p>Help?</p>  <p>Thanks Guys, Matthew Mariner.</p>  <p>PS: I hope it's not against the rules to link to Imgur. If it is im sorry.</p>
