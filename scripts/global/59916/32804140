<p>I'm working with media queries in order to make mobile-friendly a small two to three page site. I wanted to provide custom styles for any device with a width less than or equal to 375px (iPhone 6, for example). Here's how I am doing that in my css</p>  <pre><code>@media only screen and (max-width: 375px)  {   body {     background-color: green;   } } </code></pre>  <p>The problem is, when I simulate the iPhone using Google Chrome's device mode, the background-color: green isn't triggering. Moreover, the dimensions of the simulated phone aren't sized how they should be according to the rulers. It's kind of difficult to explain so I linked a <a href="http://screencast.com/t/DsZOCyPvu" rel="nofollow">screenshot</a> and pointed to the parts that aren't making sense to me. Any idea what I'm missing? Any help is appreciated. </p>  <p>I should also mention that when I resize my screen outside of the simulator, the media query works fine. </p>
