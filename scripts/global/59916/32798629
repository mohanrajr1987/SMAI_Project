<p>I have written media queries in this order. But some of my html code is not working, which does not have any relation with this media queries. A html button disabled in responsive view. But after deleting the media queries it is working fine. I have checked the code, all the brackets are closed properly. Is there any strict rule that should follow while writing media queries?</p>  <p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false"> <div class="snippet-code"> <pre class="snippet-code-css lang-css prettyprint-override"><code>@media all and (max-width:1200px) {  }  @media all and (max-width:992px) {  }  @media all and (max-width:768px) {  }  @media all and (max-width:480px) {  }  @media all and (max-width:320px) {  }</code></pre> </div> </div> </p>
