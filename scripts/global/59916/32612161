<p>I always liked the concept of responsiveness, and I wonder if it's possible to achieve something like <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/brcv2wyb/" rel="nofollow">THIS</a> in pure CSS (without using javascript, resize the viewport to see the elements stacking).</p>  <p>The requirements:</p>  <ul> <li>items can have different lengths</li> <li>items turn to <code>width: 100%</code> or <code>display: block</code> when they would exceed the horizontal space available in their container</li> <li>avoiding breakpoints with fixed pixel/em value like: <code>@media (max-width: 600px)</code></li> </ul>  <p>Cheers!</p>
