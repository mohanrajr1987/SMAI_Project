<p>I have the following code and am testing it on a square shaped 1280 x 1024 quare screen:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/respond.js/1.4.2/respond.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;style&gt;     .m { height: 100px; width: 100px; background-color: aqua; }      @media only screen and (max-width: 1280px) {         .m { background-color: red; }     }         &lt;/style&gt;  &lt;div class="m"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Everything works as expected in normal browsers, but on IE11 the div's colour is still aqua and not red. I have researched the issue and <strong>included respond.js</strong>, but it does not seem to make any difference. I have noticed that when I resize the browser window and make it just a little bit smaller the div gets indeed redm but not on full screen.</p>  <p>Update: here is a sample: <a href="http://codepen.io/vee6/pen/BoKGov" rel="nofollow">http://codepen.io/vee6/pen/BoKGov</a></p>
