<p>I want to build some media queries to cover most of the aspect ratio out there for pc/laptops.</p>  <p>My first attempt was this:</p>  <pre><code>@media screen and (min-device-aspect-ratio: 4/3){      header::after{          content: '4/3';      }   }  @media screen and (min-device-aspect-ratio: 16/9){       header::after{          content: '16/9';      }  }   @media screen and (min-device-aspect-ratio: 16/10){       header::after{          content: '16/10';      }  } </code></pre>  <p>I was testing those queries from a laptop with a resolution of 1366x768 which is 16/9 aspect ratio , instead of this, the last query of 16/10 is executed.</p>  <p>I could do this in the classic way , with:</p>  <pre><code>@media (min-width:1025px) { /* big landscape tablets, laptops, and desktops */ } @media (min-width:1281px) { /* hi-res laptops and desktops */ } </code></pre>  <p>but i think the responsive design should focus more on aspect ratio rather than screen width , because it's a big difference beetween 4:3 and the wide ones 16/9 , or maybe i've misunderstood the responsive design concept but this is what i think.</p>
