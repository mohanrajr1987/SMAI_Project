<p>I am currently using three stylesheets to create a responsive layout within an existing website. The following stylesheets are implented within the :</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>The last stylesheet (custom-breakpoints.css) uses inline @{media queries..} to create custom breakpoints. This sheet contents for example the following media queries:</p>  <p>@media (max-width: 999px) {   .. } @media (max-width: 730px) {   .. } @media (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 767px) {   .. }</p>  <p>I expected that the last stylesheet with customized breakpoints would override all css within the other two stylesheets. However, it looks like the first two stylesheets get a higher priority (maybe because of the media attribute) AND IE (also Edge) seems to skip the last stylesheet completely.</p>  <p>Anyone any idea what goes wrong?</p>  <p>Best regards, Jofcar</p>
