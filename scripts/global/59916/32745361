<p>I'm making my web page into a pdf via jsPDF and it only allows sizing in points, millimeters and centimeters. I know the pixel to point conversion is 1 pixel to 0.75 points, but how do I convert when I don't know the DPI and every conversion tool changes the values based on that?</p>  <p>My CSS would always be:</p>  <pre><code>.something { width: 64em; } /* (1024 pixels on normal display) */ </code></pre>  <p>But, when that's converted to a printed page, what would it be? How do I ensure I'm making it the right width for the printed page?</p>
