<p>Has anyone run into issues where iron-media-query doesn't seem to be setting the query-matches bound property on initial loading of the site?  In other words, if the site is initially loaded in a smaller viewport (such as on mobile or in desktop in smaller window), various local DOM elements are not being hidden using <code>hidden$="{{_smallScreen}}"</code></p>  <p>However, if the site is initially loaded in a larger viewport and then subsequently reduced in size, the iron-media-query hides the local DOM elements appropriately.</p>
