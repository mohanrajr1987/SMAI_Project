<p>The width of my page is under 991px and still the 'max-width 1200px' is overwriting my 'max-width 991px' rule in css. </p>  <p>This is a screenshot of my devtools window  : </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/RVfeg.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/RVfeg.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>This can be solved by putting '!important' behind the 'margin-top...' css rule. But still I want to know why this is the case.</p>
