<p>I am using acts_as_taggable_on for my tagging system, wherein each article has one or more tags. However, the way it's setup now, the tags are capitalized and have spaces as well as special characters between them and these carry through to my routes. In other words, a tag like "Barack Obama" passes all the way to the routes unchanged; it seems my urls are completely unencoded.</p>  <p>I'm wondering what the correct way to deal with this is.</p>  <p>My articles controller looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>class ArticlesController &lt; ApplicationController   before_action :set_articles, only: [:tagged]    def tagged     @tag = params[:tag]     tagged_with = @articles.tagged_with(@tag)     if @tag.present? &amp;&amp; tagged_with.present?       @articles = tagged_with     else       redirect_to root_path, alert: "Oops! There are no articles with tagged #{@tag}"     end   end    private   def set_articles     @articles = user_signed_in? ? Article.all : Article.where published: true   end end </code></pre>  <p>and my routes.rb look like this:</p>  <pre><code>Rails.application.routes.draw do   root 'home#index'   # This is the route that generates publicly facing tag urls:   get 'tags/:tag', to: 'articles#tagged', as: :tag, tag: /.*/   # This is for internal use:   %w(people cities countries other).each do |tag|     get tag, to: "articles#collect_tags", as: tag, tag: tag   end end </code></pre>  <p>When I click a tag, my urls currently look like:</p>  <p><code>http://mywebsite.com/tags/Barack Obama</code></p>  <p>or</p>  <p><code>http://mywebsite.com/tags/Shinz≈ç Abe</code></p>  <p>I'm not sure if these are being internally escaped or if something needs doing? Any advice is appreciated.</p>
