<p>I have searched for similar questions but what I found is quite different from what I am trying to achieve. </p>  <p>I'm trying to get the status of a given day which would be in the range of days between the start and end dates in the db.</p>  <p>Records:     </p>  <pre><code>#&lt;Schedule id: 1, starts_at: "2015-10-03", ends_at: "2015-10-15", status: "Available"&gt;  #&lt;Schedule id: 2, starts_at: "2015-10-16", ends_at: "2015-10-30", status: "Busy"&gt; </code></pre>  <p>what is the best way to retrieve the status of the day where the date is "2015-10-9"?</p>
