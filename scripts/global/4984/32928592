<p>On a our Heroku Rails 4.2 web app running Unicorn workers, where each worker needs about 230MB, we can run 2 per '1X' Heroku dyno, or 4 per '2X' Heroku dyno. CPU requirements are quite low.</p>  <p>If we need 8 workers to handle our traffic, what are the technical / performance tradeoffs of using four '1X' dynos vs. two '2X' dynos to get 8 workers?</p>  <p>(Two years ago there was a well-publicized issue with the way Heroku was routing to dynos that as I recall suggested larger dynos with more workers worked best because there was less chance of a request being routed to a 'busy' dyno. But I'm not finding any <em>current</em> guidelines on when it is best to use larger dynos vs more dynos.)</p>
