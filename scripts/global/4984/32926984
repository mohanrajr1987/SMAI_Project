<p>I've been dabbling around in rails and I'm having a hard time understanding how a foreign key automatically get's populated in a table of a model when I push something into it. For example, in a 1:N table relationship of Cart to Ingredients(assuming no carts were made), if I code this:</p>  <pre><code># create cart and couple of ingredients cart1 = Cart.create() jelly = Ingredient.create() pb = Ingredient.create()  # push jelly, and pb, into cart1 cart1.ingredients &lt;&lt; jelly cart1.ingredients &lt;&lt; pb  # pb and jelly cart_id is now populated pb.cart_id &gt;&gt;1 jelly.cart_id &gt;&gt;1 </code></pre>  <p>How does rails populate the foreign id, cart_id, column without me having to do anything, except push the ingredient into the cart?</p>
