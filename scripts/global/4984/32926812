<p>I'm in the process of creating a website similar to Reddit. I would like to allow a moderator to be able to update a topic, but not be able to create or delete topic. I'm aware that I need to update TopicsController but I'm not sure how. My main problem is that I'm not sure how to make the code specific enough to ensure that a moderator can only update; not delete or create a topic, as an admin can.</p>  <p>My current code looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>class PostsController &lt; ApplicationController    before_action :require_sign_in, except: :show   before_action :authorize_user, except: [:show, :new, :create]    def show     @post = Post.find(params[:id])   end    def new     @topic = Topic.find(params[:topic_id])     @post = Post.new   end    def create     @post.body = params[:post][:body]     @topic = Topic.find(params[:topic_id])     @post = @topic.posts.build(post_params)     @post.user= current_user     if @post.save       flash[:notice] = "Post was saved"       redirect_to [@topic, @post]     else       flash[:error] = "There was an error saving the post. Please try again."       render :new     end   end    def edit     @post = Post.find(params[:id])   end    def update     @post = Post.find(params[:id])     @post.assign_attributes(post_params)      if @post.save       flash[:notice] = "Post was updated."       redirect_to [@post.topic, @post]     else       flash[:error] = "There was an error saving the post. Please try again."       render :edit     end   end    def destroy     @post = Post.find(params[:id])      if @post.destroy       flash[:notice] = "\"#{@post.title}\" was deleted successfully."       redirect_to @post.topic     else       flash[:error] = "There was an error deleting the post."       render :show     end   end    private    def post_params     params.require(:post).permit(:title, :body)   end    def authorize_user     post = Post.find(params[:id])      unless current_user == post.user || current_user.admin?       flash[:error] = "You must be an admin to do that."       redirect_to [post.topic, post]     end   end  end </code></pre>  <p>I've already added a moderator role to the enum role. </p>  <p>I apologise if this seems really basic...but it has got me stumped!</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
