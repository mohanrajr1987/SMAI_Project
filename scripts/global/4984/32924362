<p>I'm using the <a href="https://github.com/alexreisner/geocoder" rel="nofollow">Rails Geocoder Gem</a>, Rails 4.2 and MySqL. I want to detect how many travels are compatible with some boxes.</p>  <p>Travels and boxes have these fields: <code>departure_address</code>, <code>departure_lat</code>, <code>departure_long</code> and <code>arrival_address</code>, <code>arrival_lat</code>, <code>arrival_long</code>.</p>  <p>When I want to check if a travel is compatible with a box I try with this query:  </p>  <pre><code>Travel.near([Box.last.departure_lat, Box.last.departure_long], 50) </code></pre>  <p>I know it is considering only <code>departure_address</code> and not <code>arrival_address</code> but anyway it doesn't work because Geocoder tries to find a 'latitude' field in table 'travels' even if I called it 'dep_lat' and so on for longitude.</p>  <p>I want to solve this problem and then think to combine it with arrivals. Thanks!</p>
