<p>I'm unsure what to post here script wise. I'm trying to complete a tutorial and it wants me to create Advertisement. I made the Controller/Model, but I'm having a couple issues.</p>  <p>My index is showing all of the ads, but when I try to create one, I get an error</p>  <blockquote>   <p>undefined method `advertisements_path' for #&lt;#:0x007fa84c5a59f0></p> </blockquote>  <p>Now I see it mentions 'advertisementS' so I know it wants plural. My controller is singular. If I go into routes and I add  resources :advertisements AS WELL, it -will- allow me to create an Ad, but when it goes to submit it, I get errors (Likely since everything is still set to AdvertisementController (Singular).</p>  <p>I'm not quite sure what code to post, so I'll post things I think are relevant.</p>  <pre><code>Rails.application.routes.draw do   resources :posts   resources :advertisement </code></pre>  <p>This is where I can add a plural resources to get it to 'load' but fail to save.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;%= form_for @advertisement do |f| %&gt;   &lt;div class="form-group"&gt;       &lt;%= f.label :title %&gt;       &lt;%= f.text_field :title, class: 'form-control', placeholder: "Enter post title" %&gt;   &lt;div class="form-group"&gt;     &lt;%= f.submit "Save", class: 'btn btn-success' %&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>THIS is where I am getting my initial warning, on the "form_for @advertisement" line.</p>  <pre><code>  def create @advertisement = Advertisement.new @advertisement.title = params[:advertisement][:title] @advertisement.copy = params[:advertisement][:copy] @advertisement.price = params[:advertisement][:price] if @advertisement.save   flash[:notice] = "The Ad was saved."   redirect_to @advertisement else   flash[:error] = "There was an error saving the ad. Please try again."   render :new end </code></pre>  <p>end</p>  <p>This references my def create from AdvertisementController.</p>  <p>(Essentially the purpose of the tutorial is to duplicate almost exactly what we do for Posts. It worked, up until now. Functionality works until I go to create a new one. </p>  <p>I've been working on it for a couple hours, but I'm struggling to understand when to use plural vs singular. (There is no integration as of yet, so belong_to isn't relevant yet. </p>
