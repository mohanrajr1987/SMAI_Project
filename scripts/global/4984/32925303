<p>It saves the image to s3 but then rollsback and saves again, rollsback, saves infinitely. After I manually stop the process the image is saved to s3 and the appropriate s3 url link is added to the instance.</p>  <p>If I run the same command through terminal, it works perfectly.</p>  <p>URI.parse("image_url")</p>  <p>Has anyone else had a similar issue?  Any suggestions of what the issue may be?</p>
