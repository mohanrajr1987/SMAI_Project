<p>I've been working on a website with Ruby on Rails, and one page requires a URL like this: "agorastudent.com/shop/mixitup". However, when I use the following code, it doesn't load any assets.</p>  <pre><code>map "/shop/mixitup" do    run lambda { |env|    [      200,       {        'Content-Type'  =&gt; 'text/html',         'Cache-Control' =&gt; 'public, max-age=86400'       },      File.open('public/business-mixitup.html', File::RDONLY)    ]  } end </code></pre>  <p>Is there another way to do this?</p>
