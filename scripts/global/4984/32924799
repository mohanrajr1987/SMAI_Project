<p>I have a <code>Track</code> model that has a <code>title:string</code> attribute and an association setup where it has multiple <code>featured_artists</code>. At times a track's title includes the names of featured artists:</p>  <pre><code>Give It To Me (feat. Justin Timberlake &amp; Nelly Furtado)  Fire We Make (with Maxwell) </code></pre>  <p>What I'd like to do is parse this string, find if anything in the string matches the array of names from the track's featured artists and <code>link_to</code> their individual profile page.</p>  <p>My original thought was to <code>map</code> the track's featured artists by name:</p>  <pre><code>track.featured_artists.map(&amp;:name) =&gt; ["Justin Timberlake", "Nelly Furtado"] </code></pre>  <p>Right now I'm having trouble effectively breaking down the letter spaced words from <code>track.title</code>, comparing them to the aforementioned array, and linking where appropriate:</p>  <pre><code>link_to featured_artist.name, artist_path(featured_artist) </code></pre>  <p>Is there a pre-existing rails helper method that I'm overlooking? If not how would I go about in creating one of my own?</p>  <p><strong>This is normally how the title is generated in the show view</strong></p>  <pre><code>&lt;% @tracks.each do |track| %&gt;   &lt;div&gt;&lt;%= track.name %&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;% end %&gt; </code></pre>
