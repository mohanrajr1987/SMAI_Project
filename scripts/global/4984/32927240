<p>I have a Rails application where a User can create many  Articles:</p>  <pre><code>class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base   has_many :articles end  class Article &lt; ActiveRecord::Base   belongs_to :user end </code></pre>  <p>Now I want to save user favorites. But I can't figure out a structure for how to manage user favorites within the existing sturcture. Should I make a new many to many relation?</p>  <p>Or will I have to change the entire structure?</p>
