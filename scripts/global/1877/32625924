<p>I'm developing an OSGI bundle which uses the native library <strong>librxtxSerial</strong>.  The first time, i had to deploy this bundle on a raspberry, so i've did something like that:</p>  <p>I put the native library under: lib/librxtxSerial.so (NB: INSIDE the java project).</p>  <p>Then, in the MANIFEST i've wrote: </p>  <pre><code>Bundle-NativeCode: lib/librxtxSerial.so </code></pre>  <p><strong>Everything works fine!!!</strong></p>  <p>Now, the problem is that i've to deploy the same bundle on other embedded device which uses a different processor architecture (x86 instead ARM).</p>  <p>So, i've downloaded the x86 build for the librxtxSerial library and i modified my folder structure in something like that:</p>  <pre><code> - lib    - x86      - librxtxSerial.so    - arm      - librxtxSerial.so </code></pre>  <p>And i've modified my MANIFEST in this way:</p>  <pre><code>Bundle-NativeCode: lib/x86/librxtxSerial;processor=x86, lib/arm/librxtxSerial;processor=ARM_le </code></pre>  <p>Trying to compile (through maven tycho plugin) i always get the same error:</p>  <pre><code>No match found for native code: lib/x86/librxtxSerial; processor=x86, lib/arm/librxtxSerial; processor=ARM_le </code></pre>  <p>How can i solve this?</p>  <p>Thank you all.</p>
