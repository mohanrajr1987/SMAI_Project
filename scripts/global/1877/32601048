<p>I am creating a OSGI project in Eclipse with Felix as an OSGI container. For this i have a dependecy projects are mentioned below and added in Manifest file.</p>  <pre><code>org.eclipse.osgi;bundle-version="3.10.100",  org.eclipse.equinox.console;bundle-version="1.1.100",  org.apache.felix.gogo.command;bundle-version="0.10.0",  org.apache.felix.gogo.runtime;bundle-version="0.10.0",  org.apache.felix.gogo.shell;bundle-version="0.10.0" </code></pre>  <p>Once the project is deployed i can view the bundles using ss command which is provided by equinox console commands(ss). Here i want to use karaf console functionalities instead of equinox. Is it possible to use karaf console by eliminating equinox console? Because i want to use karaf console commands osgi:bundle, osgi:install etc. </p>
