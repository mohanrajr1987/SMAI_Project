<p>I have written a servlet using the directions in this tutorial: <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/fiorep/domino-osgi-development" rel="nofollow">http://www.slideshare.net/fiorep/domino-osgi-development</a> slides 34 to 57.  This worked well and was easy to debug when deployed via the pde.launch.ini.  Now I want to work out how to deploy it to another server.</p>  <p>From what I can figure out, I think the preferred way is to create an OSGi bundle and deploy it via an updatesite.nsf.  When I try to add a new local update site to the update site, it prompts me for a site.xml.  This is where it falls apart for me - where does that file come from?  Have I missed some steps?</p>
