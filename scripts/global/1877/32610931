<p>I am trying to create a simple OSGI bundle using Eclipse Mars and Apache Karaf. I've downloaded EIK plugin from this <a href="https://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/eik/" rel="nofollow">link</a> and integrated EIK plugin by following the steps in the <a href="https://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/eik/wiki/UsingEIK" rel="nofollow">link</a>. I have created a OSGI bundle using this <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/article/2077837/java-se/hello--osgi--part-1--bundles-for-beginners.html?page=2" rel="nofollow">link</a>. While trying to set target platform in plugin development it is not showing apache-karaf but by creating target platform from EIK showing compilation errors in osgi project. </p>  <p><strong>Environment</strong></p>  <pre><code>OS: Windows 7 64 bit  Eclipse-Mars JDK-1.7.u75 </code></pre>  <p><strong>Issues</strong></p>  <ol> <li>I tried to map the latest apache karaf-4.0.x but it is not resolving when i tried to use apache-karaf-2.2.x it got resolved. Is there any dependency for karaf with eclipse.</li> <li>The project got executed successfully when i set my runtime as Equinox as default runtime. Is there any dependency for executing apache-karaf as runtime? </li> <li>I got the below exception in eclipse for apache-karaf as runtime.</li> <li>Is there any dependency between eclipse, apache-karaf version?</li> </ol>  <p>An internal error occurred during: "Launching Karaf-Test".</p>  <pre><code>java.lang.NullPointerException </code></pre>  <p>Can anybody suggest me some links or please tell me what is going wrong in my setup.</p>
