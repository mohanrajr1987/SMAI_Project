<p>I am creating a <code>OSGI</code>  project in Eclipse using default <code>Equinox</code> container. But i want to import <code>felix</code> <code>karaf</code> framework in eclipse and use the features provided by <code>karaf</code> in eclipse console. </p>  <p>I've downloaded <code>felix</code> framework and added as a dependency in my project. While executing the <code>osgi</code> project by select the runtime as <code>felix</code> I am getting the following error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Unable to find any Apache Felix main bundle (org.apache.felix.main)   in the workspace or the Target Platform.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Also can anybody please clarify my questions:</p>  <ol> <li>How to import <code>felix</code> runtime in eclipse as similar as including a apache tomcat server in a server tab of J2EE eclipse.</li> <li>Is it possible to do <code>OSGI</code> development with <code>felix</code> as container.ie) I should execute <code>Felix</code> console commands in my eclipse console. As of now I can execute only <code>equinox</code> commands (ss).</li> </ol>
