<p>I am trying to deploy an bundle in Apache karaf-2.3.10 container which inturn has jar file dependencies. After copying the dependency jar file to deploy dirctory of Apache-Karaf dependency issue got resolved. How to install the normal jar through command line. I tried the below command </p>  <pre><code>osgi:install -s 'wrap:mvn:&lt;path to the jar file/test.jar&gt;' </code></pre>  <p>which shows </p>  <pre><code>Error executing command: Error installing bundles: </code></pre>  <p>My bundle has lot of dependency jar files. Do i need to copy all the jar files to deploy directory? If, it will become messy.  Is there any other way to point the location or creation a config file so that in activation bundles dependencies will be resolved.</p>
