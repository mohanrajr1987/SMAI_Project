<p>I'm playing around Vaadin v7  , deployed as osgi bundle on plain osgi framework with grizzly as http service provider . Im able to start and load the page(1.jpg) , but when I click a button , I'm getting "Cookies disabled" error message (2.jpg) . I saw there was similar issue with tomcat and httpOnly property , but couldn't find anything similar in grizzly . please direct me where to start looking . thanks in advance.
