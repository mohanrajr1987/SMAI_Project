<p>I have a OSGi Transformer component which is instantiated by sling. In my OSGi component I have the following annotations :</p>  <pre><code>@Component(configurationFactory = true, metatype = true, policy =       ConfigurationPolicy.REQUIRE, label = "CDN Link Rewriter", description = "Rewrites links to all static files to use configurable CDN") @Service(value = TransformerFactory.class) public class StaticLinkTransformer implements Transformer,     TransformerFactory </code></pre>  <p>I have some properties which I have annotated as @Property</p>  <pre><code>@Property(label = "CDN Url prefix", description = "CDN URL prefix", value = "") private static final String CDN_URL_PREFIX = "cdn_url_prefix"; </code></pre>  <p>Now I am able to provide multiple configurations for this class using "+" sign in felix console. If I have "N" number of configurations, sling is instantiating N objects of my StaticLinkRewriter class.</p>  <p><strong>Question : How do I get the proper configurations for the object instantiated ?</strong> I mean, when sling instantiates my objects, how can i get the configurations for which the object was instantiated ?</p>
