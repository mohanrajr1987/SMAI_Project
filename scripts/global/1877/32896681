<p>So I'm wondering if there is a possibility to embed bundle into other bundle. I know that I could just put it into OSGi container, but in my scenario let's assume that I cannot do that.</p>  <p>I have full access to the code of both bundles, Bundle A has dependency to Bundle B.</p>  <p>Bundle B contains some OSGi services and components, which require configuration.</p>  <p>I'm wondering if there is a way to embed Bundle B into Bundle A in a way, that all components and services of Bundle A and Bundle B are visible in the OSGi container (for example under /system/console/components or /system/console/configMgr). I know that this sounds tricky.</p>  <p>Probably Bundle B would have to be installed in the OSGi container as a bundle by Bundle A. Is that even possible? Maybe if not with maven bundle plugin, then maybe something else?</p>  <p>Apache Felix is mine OSGi container</p>
