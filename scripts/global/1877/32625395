<p>I have some bundles started in karaf and want to change their configuration during start. I created class that implements ConfigurationPlugin and registered it in karaf. When I installed bundle, my configuration plugin was invoked and changed configuration, but blueprint set old config value to the bundle. </p>  <p>How can I use this ConfigurationPlugin for this goal?</p>  <p>Blueprint is very simple:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;blueprint xmlns="http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/blueprint/v1.0.0"        xmlns:cm="http://aries.apache.org/blueprint/xmlns/blueprint-cm/v1.1.0"&gt;      &lt;cm:property-placeholder persistent-id="my" update-strategy="reload"&gt;     &lt;/cm:property-placeholder&gt;     &lt;bean id="serviceBean" class="com.mycompany.blueprint.MyServiceImpl"&gt;         &lt;property name="prop" value="${mydb.password}" /&gt;     &lt;/bean&gt; &lt;/blueprint&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Configuration file contains only one encrypted property. It should be somehow decrypted using another bundle during creation.</p>
