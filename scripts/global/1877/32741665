<p>I have made an Plug-in with the "Plug-in from Existing JAR Archives" option. (like said here <a href="http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseJarToPlugin/article.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseJarToPlugin/article.html</a> )</p>  <p>But now I want to update this plugin with a new version of this JAR.</p>  <p>It looks like I need to delete the plugin and redo it, but I'm sure thats not the correct way to do it.</p>
