<p>I have some problem to figure out how user preferences and bundle properties could work together. </p>  <h2>Example</h2>  <p>Given a service interface, named Storage, and two providers, FileStorage and DatabaseStorage. I want to let a user configure how his data will be store (File or Database) and some information such as path, userId or passwd. But I don't know which one among this properties should be a system preference, a user preference or a bundle property. </p>  <p>I am using Declarative Service, I know that a consumer can filter which service to consume with a target, but in my case this target is dynamic (based on user preference) and so I don't know how to unget my Storage service and request for a new one using declarative service ? </p>
