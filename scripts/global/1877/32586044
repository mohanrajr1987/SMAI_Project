<p>I am structuring an OSGi project Sbt build for mass multi-project (plugin) builds (in the 100 + region). I am emulating the eclipse concept of a target platform as a set of base dependencies that all projects inherit. The root build.sbt  and build.scala auto wire up all projects in a designated module directory providing the "target platform". </p>  <p>I now need to be able to specify cross dependencies between my plugin projects. I know how to do this in the root build.scala and build.sbt. but what is the syntax for doing it in the build.sbt of one of my projects ? </p>
