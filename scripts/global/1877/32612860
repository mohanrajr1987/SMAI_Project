<p>Imagine you want to have a highly modular web application in Java. Components are already using Spring framework also. Some components cover only pure Logic and some others also come with some presentation GUIs in HTML. The application is not Portlet compatible but we need to have dynamic menu which promotes the list of installed modules and links to the pages or REST APIs. Since itâ€™s Java, using OSGI is recommended but I got too much confused with the recent features in OSGI (introduced past few years) and I have few questions:</p>  <ul> <li><p>Now OSGI is not only Module Management System but also IoC Container! It almost contains equivalent annotations for many of Spring IoC features. So How we can use Spring enabled modules inside OSGI? Can we eliminate Spring for our new designs and completely rely on OSGI? Or for dependency Injection within the modules we can use Spring and for Dependency injection over the Modules we can use OSGI?</p></li> <li><p>For real-life large scale applications we have two options: Using Embedded Felix within application Container (e.g. Tomcat) or Using OSGI Bundle of Application Container (Jetty or Tomcat) within KARAF. Which approach is better? Which one is more scalable? </p></li> </ul>
