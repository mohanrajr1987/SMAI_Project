<p>I'm facing an issue where I have an OSGI console listening on port 55555, and a bash script that connects on such console using netcat (e.g.: echo "ss" | nc localhost 55555), to get the plugin list running on it.</p>  <p>From the time I've updated OSGI files to a new version, netcat has started received weird characters instead of the interactive console it used to receive. But, if I connect using windows Telnet (connecting on OSGI Console remotely), everything works fine just like before updating the OSGI files.</p>  <p>Does someone knows what telnet does that netcat doesn't when connects on that OSGI console?</p>  <p>As requested, below you can see how I executed both commands, windows em linux, and its returns:</p>  <pre><code>c:/telnet server1 55555 osgi&gt;_  user@server1: nc localhost 55555 ÿûÿûÿýÿýss  Piping through a cat -v:  user@server1: nc localhost 55555 | cat -v M-^?M-{^AM-^?M-{^CM-^?M-}^_M-^?M-}^X  Getting an hexadecimal return:      user@server1: nc -x hexa.log -t localhost 55555 user@server1: cat hexa.log [0000]   FF FB 01 FF FB 03 FF FD   1F FF FD 18  ........ .... </code></pre>
