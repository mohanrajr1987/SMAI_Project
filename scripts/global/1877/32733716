<p>i am building a java swing application with the netbeans 7.3 ide. Everything was going well until new requirements came in that needs the application to be build in modules. By modules i mean, the application should be divided into parts that can be compiled and packaged based on customers requirement (i.e some might need e.g accounting package, some might not), there is no need to provide so many functionality to customer that is not needed.</p>  <p>I have realised after doing some research that what i need is OSGi. It will allow me to develop plugins, and add, remove any independent subproject/plugin/module without affecting other modules. A good example i saw is Eclipse IDE.</p>  <p>My problem is, where can i learn this technology, or rather where can i find good and easy to follow tutorials on how to use it. Video tutorials will be great.</p>
