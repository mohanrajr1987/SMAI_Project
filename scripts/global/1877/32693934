<p>I am evaluating bndtools as an alternative to the websphere OSGi tooling in eclipse, to package liberty profile features.</p>  <p>Liberty profile uses OSGi subsystems packed as a .esa for extensions to the runtime. It appears that it is possible to package a subsystem using BND, based on this file in the bnd git repo.</p>  <p><a href="https://github.com/bndtools/bnd/blob/master/biz.aQute.bndlib/src/aQute/bnd/exporter/subsystem/SubsystemExporter.java" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/bndtools/bnd/blob/master/biz.aQute.bndlib/src/aQute/bnd/exporter/subsystem/SubsystemExporter.java</a></p>  <p>But I can't find any documentation about how to setup an ESA project. Can someone give me some pointers?</p>
