<p>The project I am working on is launched as an Eclipse PDE product, running the main class (let's call it <code>MainClass</code> for discussion sake) which implements the <code>IApplication</code> interface.</p>  <p>I am trying to use Declarative Services to bind my references to my service bundles. This works, in that the references are bound at startup in an instance of <code>MainClass</code>.</p>  <p>However, despite any configuration settings in the plugin and bundle such as <code>cardinality</code> and <code>singleton</code>, the Eclipse Launcher creates a new instance of <code>MainClass</code> and does not bind the services.</p>  <p>While I could store the references in a static variable when it is first bound, I am trying to avoid a messy 'hack' like this.</p>  <p>Is there any way to force the Launcher to use the existing instance of <code>MainClass</code> that was already created by the Declarative Services? Or is there some other solution to this problem, without getting rid of Eclipse PDE Launcher?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
