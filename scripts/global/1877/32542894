<p>I really need to debug my code by the use of breakpoints, however this seems a complex undertaking with an OSGi container.</p>  <p>I have Eclipse and Felix (both the latest). My project is a raw OSGi project, I am not using PDE, just maven bundle plugin to generate the bundles and then copy them to the /bundle folder in felix, then I perform java -jar bin/felix.jar and the project runs. So no fuss here.</p>  <p>However I cannot debug the application that way. I've tried to read the docs (<a href="http://felix.apache.org/documentation/development/integrating-felix-with-eclipse.html" rel="nofollow">http://felix.apache.org/documentation/development/integrating-felix-with-eclipse.html</a>) but they are outdated/broken and cant make them work...</p>  <p>How can I debug this? Will I have to avoid using OSGi just because debug is not supported...?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
