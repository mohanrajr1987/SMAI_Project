<p>On Karaf 3.0.4, I try to use CXF.</p>  <pre><code>karaf@root()&gt; feature:repo-add mvn:org.apache.cxf.karaf/apache-cxf/3.0.4/xml/features Adding feature url mvn:org.apache.cxf.karaf/apache-cxf/3.0.4/xml/features karaf@root()&gt; feature:install cxf Error executing command: Can't install feature cxf/0.0.0:    No feature named 'http' with version '0.0.0' available </code></pre>  <p>Where is the 'http' feature supposed to come from? I can't find the right feature repository.</p>
