<p>In the JavaEE/CDI world, I know how to have the list of instances of classes implementing a given interface : by using <code>Instance&lt;MyInterface&gt;</code> combined with <a href="https://github.com/ronmamo/reflections" rel="nofollow">reflections</a> library.</p>  <p>But in the OSGI/iPOJO world, how to do so ?</p>  <p>I know I get one instance by using <code>@Requires MyInterface anInstance</code>. But how can I have a programmatic access to all those classes ?</p>
