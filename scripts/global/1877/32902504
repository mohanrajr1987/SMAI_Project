<p>I had an existing jar, which I have converted to OSGI Bundle now.</p>  <p>Problem is that now (as OSGI Bundle), it can not load resources.  I am using <code>ClassLoader.getSystemResource()</code> method, it returns <code>null</code>.</p>  <p>Used code:</p>  <pre><code>java.net.URL jdbc = ClassLoader.getSystemResource("com/company/cfg/provider/JDBC.xml"); </code></pre>  <p>I do not have access to source code so please tell some way by changing configuration (manifest file or something else) to make it work.</p>  <p>Bundle.getResource() works but I can not change the source code.</p>
