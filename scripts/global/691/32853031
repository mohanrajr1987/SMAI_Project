<p>It seems that, according to many questions, it is not possible to use speech recognition in firefox. Confirmed here: <a href="http://caniuse.com/web-speech" rel="nofollow">http://caniuse.com/web-speech</a></p>  <p>Even though <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25046281/can-i-have-a-speech-recognition-on-firefox">firefox is working on it</a>, it is still unfinished yet.</p>  <p>However there is this site: <a href="http://api.ai" rel="nofollow">http://api.ai</a> where it just works, on <em>any</em> browser.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/gW7rp.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/gW7rp.png" alt="Speech input"></a></p>  <p>Could someone explain how this works?</p>
