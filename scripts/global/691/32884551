<p>The following code does not work:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;body ng-app="flapperNews" ng-controller="MainCtrl"&gt;     &lt;form ng-submit="addPost()"&gt;         &lt;input type="text" class="form-control" placeholder="Fill in a title" ng-model="title" /&gt;         &lt;input type="text" class="form-control" placeholder="Fill in a link" ng-model="link" /&gt;         &lt;button type="submit" ng-disabled="!title"&gt;Add a new post&lt;/button&gt;     &lt;/form&gt; &lt;/body&gt; </code></pre>  <p>In fact, it works, but it does too much. It disables the button when title is empty, which is correct, but it will also disable the first input field (in firefox). In safari this works fine.</p>  <p>The AngularJS module:</p>  <pre><code>/* global angular */  var app = angular.module('flapperNews', []);  app.controller('MainCtrl', ['$scope', function ($scope) {         $scope.posts = [           {title: "post 1", upvotes: 5},           {title: "post 2", upvotes: 7},           {title: "post 3", upvotes: 3},           {title: "post 4", upvotes: 2},           {title: "post 5", upvotes: 6}         ];          $scope.addPost = function() {           $scope.posts.push({             title: $scope.title,             upvotes: 0,             link: $scope.link           });           $scope.title = "";           $scope.link = "";         };     }]); </code></pre>  <p>Is there something I'm missing? If so, why would it work perfectly in all browsers except Firefox?</p>  <p>Demo to the code: <a href="http://embed.plnkr.co/rBQOC9RbroQM5E3bbLZy/preview" rel="nofollow">http://embed.plnkr.co/rBQOC9RbroQM5E3bbLZy/preview</a></p>  <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>  <p>The bug could not be replicated in Plunker and JSFiddle. Apparently there was a caching issue, forced refresh in Firefox resolved the issue.</p>
