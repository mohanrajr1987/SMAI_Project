<p>The <code>onload</code> event in inline HTML is firing prematurely in Firefox and all browsers based on its Mozilla codebase (Tor, etc.) For example: </p>  <pre><code>&lt;img onload="myFunction()" src="image.jpg" /&gt; </code></pre>  <p>This calls <code>myFunction()</code> after the image is fully loaded on Chrome, Opera, IE, and Safari (not sure about the new Edge browser, though), which is the expected and documented behavior. </p>  <p>However, on Firefox and its relatives, the function is called <strong><em>immediately</em></strong> upon the browser reading the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag, i.e. <strong><em>before the loading of the image is finished</em></strong>. This is not the documented behavior and causes application problems.</p>  <p>This is confirmed and discussed in detail a few years ago here:</p>  <p><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=626613" rel="nofollow">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=626613</a></p>  <p>I can't find anything that solves the problem, though, and I wonder if anyone else has run into this problem and has found the solution.</p>
