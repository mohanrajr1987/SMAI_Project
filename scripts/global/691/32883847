<p>Consider this code:</p>  <pre><code>Test = function() { }  t = new Test();  for (var i = 0; i &lt; 8; i++) {   result = t instanceof Test; } </code></pre>  <p>If you change the number of iterations from <strong>8</strong> to <strong>9</strong>, the loop will suddenly take about <strong>100 times longer</strong> to complete in the latest version of Firefox (41.0.1). I tested this on two different PCs and the magic limit is always 8.</p>  <p>Here is the JSPerf test that I used: <a href="http://jsperf.com/instanceof-8-times-vs-9-times">http://jsperf.com/instanceof-8-times-vs-9-times</a></p>  <p><strong>Does anyone have any idea why that might happen?</strong> It seems to be specific to <strong>instanceof</strong>. It does not happen if you do something else with the object, for example check a property.</p>  <hr>  <p>Note: I also filed a <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1210342">Bugzilla bug</a> about this.</p>
