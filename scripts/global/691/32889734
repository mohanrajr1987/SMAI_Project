<p>I am creating a HTML page where I have two text fields, one is at the top of page and the other is at the bottom. If I focus on second text field then my browser should auto scroll to the top side.</p>  <p>What should I do to achieve this? I am using Mozilla Firefox</p>  <p>This may be possible by auto scrolling, but how can I implement it?</p>  <p>Is there any other way to achieve this using HTML or Javascript or jQuery?</p>
