<p>A few days back I added a overlaying gradient effect to one of my pages. I wrote it directly between two <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tags for testing into my <code>index.php</code>. Now I wanted to copy it into my <code>.css</code> file but whenever I delete or change the following part from my file the site is not accessible anymore because of an ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS error.</p>  <p>This ist the part causing the problem (notice: the css works find. I can't delete it anymore from the source file without causing errors):</p>  <pre><code>gradient {   position:absolute;   z-index:2;   right:17px; bottom:25px; left:17px;   height:125px; /* adjust it to your needs */   background: url(data:image/svg+xml;base64,alotofcodehere);   background: -moz-linear-gradient(top,  rgba(255,255,255,0) 0%, rgba(255,255,255,1) 70%);   background: -webkit-gradient(linear, left top, left bottom, color-stop(0%,rgba(255,255,255,0)), color-stop(70%,rgba(255,255,255,1)));   background: -webkit-linear-gradient(top,  rgba(255,255,255,0) 0%,rgba(255,255,255,1) 70%);   background: -o-linear-gradient(top,  rgba(255,255,255,0) 0%,rgba(255,255,255,1) 70%);   background: -ms-linear-gradient(top,  rgba(255,255,255,0) 0%,rgba(255,255,255,1) 70%);   background: linear-gradient(to bottom,  rgba(255,255,255,0) 0%,rgba(255,255,255,1) 80%); }â€‹ </code></pre>  <p>What I've done so far:</p>  <ul> <li>deleted every browser data, even manually for several times now</li> <li>allowed third party cookies</li> <li>private mode</li> <li>read a lot of different threads about the error</li> <li>restarted my PC, apache, nearly everything</li> </ul>  <p>But nothing works and now I'm very suspicious what causes this weird problem. I tried to access the site from another machine with Chrome and Edge. Same issue. When I copy back the CSS part shown above, everything works fine. The console shows the following:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/QmSla.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/QmSla.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Could there be a -maybe- caching problem with apache? I'm very confused at the moment. Never though a CSS definition can affect a site in that way.</p>  <p>Does anyone have any idea or keywords for me? Thank you in advance!</p>  <p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/3VMcO.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/3VMcO.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I've made my code not using sessions and cookies anymore but this didn't do the trick. It's the CSS part that still causes the problem whereas I have no idea how.</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The <code>header(...)</code> caused the problem. I have to write it inside the curly brackets:</p>  <pre><code>if(isset($_POST['RequestType']) &amp;&amp; isset($_POST['OperatingSystem'])  ) {     saveRequest(); } else if(isset($_POST['RequestToDelete'])) {     deleteRequest(); } else if(isset($_POST['Login'])) {     login(); } header("Location: index.php"); </code></pre>
