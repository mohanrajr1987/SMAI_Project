<p>Note:  I see this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3644791/network-connection-closed-unexpectedly-upon-svn-checkout">question</a> but it does not help me.  </p>  <p>I have installed <code>tortoise SVN</code> on <code>Windows 7</code> PC, my repository is on Linux server.  I created the both private and public keys using <code>PUTTYGEN</code> and saved the public key on <code>authorized_keys</code> file and added the private key using <code>PAGEANT</code>.<br> Previously I had all of this and the tortoise SVN worked correctly, but now I have some error when I want to checkout projects from server using the following command:</p>  <pre><code>svn+ssh://user@x.x.x.x/... </code></pre>  <p>Error:</p>  <pre><code>Unable to connect to a repository at URL 'svn+ssh://user@x.x.x.x' To better debug SSH connection problems, remove the -q option from 'ssh' in the [tunnels] section of your Subversion configuration file. Network connection closed unexpectedly </code></pre>  <p>Now in my /home/svnuser/.ssh I have two files: <code>authorized_keys</code> and <code>db_rsa</code>.<br> I pasted the public key in the <code>authorized_keys</code> file, but don't know what should be copied in the <code>db_rsa</code>  </p>
