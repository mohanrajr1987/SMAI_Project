<p>I have created a new folder and I did a "checkup" and I got all my files from the repository. After that, I put in trunk file a new file(<code>file.R</code>) and do an "update" . Everything seems to be fine but when I am trying to commit the file I get the following error: </p>  <p><code>Commit failed (details follow): File 'C:\trunk\example.R' is out of date Path '/"path"/example.R' already exists You have to update your working copy first.</code></p>  <p>It doesn't make sense because it is a new file so it is updated. Can anyone help me? I am on Windows, with TortoiseSVN 1.9.1</p>
