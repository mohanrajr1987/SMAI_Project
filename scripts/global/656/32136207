<p>I've been having issues with TortoiseSVN 1.9 and IntelliJ 14 for a while, which disappeared after downgrading Tortoise to 1.8 (thank you, Lazy Badger for the answer).</p>  <p>Now whenever I right-click a folder I get a popup titled "CrashHandler initialization error" and the following message: "C:\Program Files\TortoiseSVN\bin\SendRpt.exe not found". It's a native crash handler of Tortoise, but its exe is not in the bin folder for some reason.</p>  <p>Tortoise works, it's not a blocking issue, but a very annoying one.</p>  <p>Wanted to attach a screenshot, but don't have enough reputation. :/</p>
