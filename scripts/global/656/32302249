<p>I use Tortoise as SVN client.</p>  <p>I need to update a few files to an old revision, then take the changes that this update creates and commit it to a new revision. Basically I wanna revert that revision in repository.</p>  <p>I know I can do it by creating a new working copy, using a compare-merge tool to to apply that working copy's changes into the main one, then commiting. But I'd rather do it with a unique working copy. It would be even better if I could use a command like <code>svn move</code> to make the change diretly in Subversion.</p>
