<p>I am new to SVN and I am trying to create a accelerator pack from a software package. On july 30th, I downloaded a web application package from SVN repository. Thereafter, I and my colleagues made multiple changes to the code base. </p>  <p>How do I list down  only the files that have been changed/added from July 30th? Is there an SVN command to list all such files? I tried going to each and every folder(and subfolder) and did a right click "show log" to see if there has been any changes made since July 30th but there are a lot of such folders and subfolders. Is there a quicker way to identify only the changed and added files in SVN after my first check out on July 30th</p>
