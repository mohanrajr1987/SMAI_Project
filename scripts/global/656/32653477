<p>Whenever I create an SVN repository (I'm using TortoiseSVN) I wish it would apply my standard pre-revprop-change.bat file in the hooks directory.  I use this to enable things like allowing edits to log messages.</p>  <p><strong>Is there some way to create a "default" pre-revprop-change.bat that gets added automatically upon repo creation?</strong></p>  <p>I found this question that has a similar title, but the question appears to be more about why something wasn't working that the author thought could be fixed by automatically applying the hook script.</p>
