<p>I need some help figuring out what the best thing to do is in this situation:</p>  <p>I have been developing some code on the trunk of a project. Recently I discovered that there are some problems with it, so I checked out an older revision of the project that I made some changes to. </p>  <p>Now I would like this older, modified checkout to be the head of the trunk. The problem is that I can't just check in this older version. I basically want to undo the last 5 commits and check in the changes I'm currently working on.</p>  <p>What's the best way to do this?</p>
