<p>On my project we have repository and use TortoiseSVN for pulling, merging and branching code from there, but there is no code review like I was to have on previous job. I had BitBucket+SmartGit, and that was amazing. Now I also installed SmartGit and is able to pull and push code, but as I understand code review was on BitBucket, any advices?</p>
