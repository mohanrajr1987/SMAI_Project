<p>TortoiseSVN application is running very slow. √çt waits too long when trying to open Repo-browser or updating. It keeps showing the message "Please wait while the repository browser is initializing". Then after waiting for 10 mins or so, it shows up the credential window, and then again a long wait. I installed command line sliksuberversion, and updates from command line using subversion run as normal, from which I deduced that there is no OS or network related issue. I enabled debugLogs, and got the following:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/CerLE.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/CerLE.jpg" alt="Debug logs"></a></p>  <p>The timestamps show the delay. Eventually the server connection times out, due to the delay. Please suggest.</p>
