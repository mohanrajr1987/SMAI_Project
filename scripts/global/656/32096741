<p>I have created a TAG to freeze certain versions of directories and files in the trunk. Now I would need a report (text file) for authorities which includes revisions and <strong>dates</strong> of each item in the TAG. Is that possible to do?</p>  <p>I can see revisions and dates in GUI but it would a lot of manual work to copy paste dates from GUI to report.</p>  <p>Regards, Ari</p>
