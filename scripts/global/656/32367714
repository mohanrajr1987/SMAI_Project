<p>I want to revert my codebase to a previous revision say 100 and commit the codebase as it appeared in revision 100. I want to do a hard reset, no merges with current revision are required. Currently, my head is at 200.<br>I have Tortoise SVN installed. <br><br><strong>What did not work:</strong><br>  Update to revision 100 by right clicking. Then try committing. The     commit window says there are no changes at all !!! On checking the     head using <code>svn info</code>, it says that head is at 100. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5503923/tortoise-svn-and-reverting-to-a-previous-revision">This thread</a>     suggests a lot of methods for reverting to a previous version, but     in each case the head will also be reverted and the commit window     will not show any changes at all.  <br><strong>What worked:</strong><br> svn merge -r 200:100 is suggested     by many, many answers. It works fine for all the java, jsp, tag and     properties files but when it comes to the font folder it asks this:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/dtVRw.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/dtVRw.png" alt="Merge conflict"></a> What should I enter for a hard reset to the branch 100? I pressed r and it now it shows all the files properly in commit window, without any conflicts. I am concerned about the font folder. Did I get my previous font folder? I checked the individual files in this folder and it shows that I did get my previous font folder. So, I committed the code and everything got committed without any conflict.</p>  <p>*Looks like I got my answer, but I am posting this anyway.</p>
