<p>From what I understand, there is a direct relationship between TortoiseSVN client versions and the SVN server versions as evident in their executable installer file names located in sourceforge.net</p>  <p>For example, </p>  <ol> <li>TortoiseSVN-1.8.7.25475-x64-svn-1.8.9.msi   <ul> <li>Tortoise SVN client version 1.8.7 compatible with SVN server 1.8.9</li> </ul></li> <li>TortoiseSVN-1.8.12.26645-x64-svn-1.8.14.msi  <ul> <li>Tortoise SVN client version 1.8.12 compatible with SVN server 1.8.14</li> </ul></li> </ol>  <p>Our SVN server version is 1.8.9. So, we we have been using Tortoise SVN client version 1.8.7. We realized today that Tortoise SVN client version 1.8.7 is no longer available in sourceforge.net. It now has <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/tortoisesvn/files/" rel="nofollow">1.8.9, 1.8.12 and 1.9.x versions only</a>.</p>  <p>Since Tortoise SVN  client 1.8.7 is not available, can we use a higher version of the client 1.8.9 for SVN server version 1.8.9.</p>  <p>I could not find compatibility matrix for TortoiseSVN client and SVN server versions. Or, is it that there is no relationship between the TortoiseSVN client and SVN server versions at all? In which case too, compatibility matrix would certainly help.</p>  <p>Apparently, there are major changes in SVN server version 1.5 and 1.8. So, some versions of clients do not work well with some versions of server. For example, <a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/tsvn_1.8_releasenotes.html#compatibility" rel="nofollow">http://tortoisesvn.net/tsvn_1.8_releasenotes.html#compatibility</a>. Hence the confusion/concern. </p>  <p>When I check compatibility in this case, I meant to ask will the client be able to use all the features provided by server. Or will there be any limitations or loss of functionality if a recommended version of client is NOT used for a specific version of server. </p>  <p><em>I have copy of the executable that I can share with whoever in the team requires it. But that's not the kind of answer I am looking for :)</em></p>
