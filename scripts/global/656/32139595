<p>I am trying to use version control for my data analysis projects although without the central server. I am trying to integrate Tortoise SVN with RStudio. I have set the global options and when I restart RStudio, it shows me the Tortoise SVN project commit monitor, I just press OK and wait for it to return to RSTudio but it does not. R takes forever to return and I end up killing the process after it becomes totally unresponsive. Am I doing something wrong with my installation or is this a bug in Tortoise svn? Has anyone faced this problem before and what did you do to fix it. Any help will be much appreciated. </p>
