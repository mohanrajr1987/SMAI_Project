What I want, is to import a local folder into my repository, and bind it, so I can update, check out, etc. </p>  <p>Right now what we do, is to import the a local folder, check-out into a new local folder to bind it, and then, it downloads the previously uploaded content (waste of time). there must be a better way right?</p>  <p>How you can help me thanks!</p>
