<p>at the moment im versioning my Project with Tortoise and SubWCRev.exe like this:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>[assembly: AssemblyVersion("1.3.0.0")]</p>      <p>[assembly: AssemblyFileVersion("1.3.$WCDATE=%y%m$.$WCREV$")]</p> </blockquote>  <p>but i would like to change the BuildNr with a specific number like 12...13...14... so that it looks like 1.3.12.21432 or whatever.</p>  <p>So the question is: is it possibly to add some custom keywords or parameters ? Or are there any other solutions? We are using Jenkins to Build our Projects.</p>
