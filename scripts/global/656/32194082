<p>There's a situation that I create a working copy from Subversion's trunk.</p>  <p>I then go changing things. Onoly ffter some changes have been made, I decide I wanna stage the work and do multiple commits over it.</p>  <p>But I don't want this work to be inside trunk just yet. I wanna create a branch for it, do some commits, then merge it into branch.</p>  <p>But that working copy was created over trunk, and changes have already happened and are urging to be commited.</p>  <p>How can I create a new branch and turn that working copy's changes to it?</p>  <p>I use CollabNet and VisualSVN and Tortoise.</p>
