<p>I have been using Tortoise SVN in windows using a local repository(copy also available in dropbox). Now for sake of work I have to migrate to Mac OS. Tortoise SVN is unavailable for mac and hence I decided to use SmartSVN. I have copied the Tortoise repository to my mac system. However I am not sure how (If it is even possible) to checkout the project files using SmartSVN. </p>  <p>Also is it possible to browse the tortoise repository using smartsvn. </p>  <p>Please advice.</p>  <p>PS: I am new to Mac and not experienced with smartsvn.</p>  <p>Regards</p>
