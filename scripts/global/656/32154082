<p>In our project we have <code>.suo</code>, <code>.csproj</code> files which are committed and while I'm working with project/solution they are often changed. When I issue the command for <code>Check for modifications</code> then these files show up. I don't want to ignore the files as they contains metadata which is useful when developing and may be changed by one of the committers(I'm not a committer by the way), but I want them not to show up in the <code>Check for modifications</code> command list. Is there a way I can achieve it, but I don't want to have to tell the committer to do any changes on this ground.</p>
