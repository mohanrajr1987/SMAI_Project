<p>I've been searching for the answer for a while, and I haven't found something which corresponds to my specific question. </p>  <p>I'm using TortoiseSVN 1.7.13, Subversion 1.7.10.</p>  <p>I'm working on a branch on a project. I have a new file which needs to be merged to the trunk. The whole branch should not be merged though, as my part of the project is not completed yet. </p>  <p>From what I have read, a simple right-click on the trunk folder, followed by merge, and picking the appropriate revision would do the trick. </p>  <p>The problem is: I don't have access to the trunk folder on my computer. Is there any other possibilities? </p>
