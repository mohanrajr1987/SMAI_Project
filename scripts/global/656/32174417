<p>I've already tried using tortoise git. I've used it for months and my usual routine when I made some changes in my local is, commit, pull and push. That seems except for the occasional issue with HEAD tags in the files.</p>  <p>Now, in my current job, I use tortoiseSVN. And the difference if the 2 is obvious, in <strong>SVN update is equivalent to pull of GIT</strong>. and so far I couldn't find <strong>push</strong> . Or maybe it is because I haven't committed anything yet. </p>  <p>Now my biggest worry is I need to push something in the repo. And the last time I update/pull was 2 weeks ago.</p>  <p>My question is, since that's the case, what should I do first, update, commit then push? Or commit, update then push?</p>  <p>I've read here <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6790410/svn-update-what-happens-to-a-local-file-with-uncommitted-changes">SVN Update, What happens to a local file with uncommitted changes?</a> that if you update with uncommitted changes, <em>It will merge HEAD with your local copy. If the changes collide - you get a nice conflict.</em> So if I commit first then update, will I be able to avoid "that" conflict? And by the way, where is SVN's command that is equivalent to push? I've read some articles about it but I don't understand it.</p>
