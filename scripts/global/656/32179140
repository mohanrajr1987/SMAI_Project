<p>Here's my set up</p>  <pre><code>-netbeans 7.4 -TortoiseSVN 1.7.9, Build 23248 - 64 Bit , 2012/08/30 18:25:37 -Subversion 1.7.6 -Using proxy but I didn't fill out Client CErtificate File and Passphrase user name, password and URL is correct because it is working if you try tto update without using Netbeans </code></pre>  <p>When I try to update, (right click on the project > Subversion > Update > Update to HEAD) This is the error message that I get : </p>  <pre><code>Authentication failed. Correct the password, username and proxy settings for the URL </code></pre>  <p>When I retry, here's what I get</p>  <pre><code>org.apache.subversion.javahl.ClientException: E175002: CONNECT request failed on 'http://XXXX:3128' </code></pre>  <p>It is weird because when I tried to checkout without using Netbeans, the credentials are working. </p>  <p>What else should I do to be able to investigate on this issue??</p>
