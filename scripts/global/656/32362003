<p>On a linux system using svn 1.8.8 or 1.6.6, I can only access partial files inside a folder on the svn repo.</p>  <pre><code>&gt;svn ls http://myserver/svn/directory &gt;not all files </code></pre>  <p>While via tortoisesvn 1.6.16, I see all the files.</p>  <p>I do not know the version of the svn server, nor have the means to obtain it.</p>  <p>Since I do not know the version of the server, it could be a break of compatibility, as stated in <a href="http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-compat" rel="nofollow">Apache's guide</a>, but I doubt it since tortoisesvn 1.6 works.</p>  <p>tortoisesvn 1.6 release notes mentions <a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/tsvn_1.6_releasenotes.html" rel="nofollow">no relevant compatibility concerns</a>.</p>  <p>I do not want to depend on tortoisesvn to access these files, what could be the issue?</p>
