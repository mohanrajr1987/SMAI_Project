<p>I selected a folder called build, and i selected ignore (recursivelly) to ignore the folder and all his subfiles.</p>  <p>The problem is that now, all the folders called build are ignored in my project, and these folders are not subfolders of the original build folder...</p>  <p>Why has happened this? how can i show a list of all the ignores of my project and how to cancel all the ignores and repeat them correctly?</p>  <p>thanks</p>
