<p>I am a web developer working with php. I have a server running with Ubuntu. We are 5 members in our team. I have set up SVN on my Ubuntu Server by using bellow commands.</p>  <pre><code>$ apt-get install subversion $ apt-get install libapache2-svn </code></pre>  <p>I created a repository</p>  <pre><code>$ svnadmin create /var/www/html/mywebproject </code></pre>  <p>I set up TortoiseSVN on my windows System. I created a directory on my D: drive and done checkout.</p>  <p>When I am trying to commit, I am getting bellow Error!!</p>  <pre><code>Command: Commit   Error: Commit failed (details follow):   Error: Can't open file '\\ubuntutest\www\html\mywebproject\db\txn-current-lock': Access is   Error:  denied.   Completed!:    </code></pre>  <p>I spent 3 days searching online, still I don't get any solution that works for me.</p>  <p><strong>Few points to consider:</strong></p>  <ol> <li>Source code should be on Linux Server running with Ubuntu-14, Apache, MySQL, PHP.</li> <li>There should be 5 developers who are going to access a common copy of the source code.</li> <li>The developers are using PC running on Windows 7.</li> <li>We are accessing the server through LAN.</li> <li>We are accessing the website like this <a href="http://111.93.176.253/mywebproject/" rel="nofollow">http://111.93.176.253/mywebproject/</a> from any browser.</li> </ol>  <p>I hope my explanation is clear enough to answer. If you are finding any difficulty understanding any part of the question, please let me know I will explain it for your your better understanding.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
