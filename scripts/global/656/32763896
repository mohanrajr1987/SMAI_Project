<p>I am newbie to version-ing and SVN. I am using Tortoise SVN and my repository is in CloudForge.</p>  <p>I want to wipe out a complete project and all revisions from repository in SVN.And start fresh a new project. I just don't want that old project and any of it's revisions in repository. Can I do this with:</p>  <pre><code>svnadmin create newrepo svnadmin dump -r 0:1231 repo | svnadmin load newrepo </code></pre>  <p>?</p>
