<p>Suppose a branch looks like this</p>  <pre><code>Project1       FolderA       FolderB        File1 </code></pre>  <p>On same PC with Tortoise client I do two checkouts:</p>  <ol> <li>one checkout of root folder <code>Project1</code> in location <code>C:\Project1</code> </li> <li>another checkout of <code>FolderB</code> in location <code>D:\FolderB</code></li> </ol>  <p>If I work separately in each location and do commits on <code>File1</code> from both <code>C:\Project1</code> and <code>D:\FolderB</code> would SVN have any problem given it's the same user or different locations?</p>  <p>I guess it works because SVN users revisions and it doesn't matter if it's same user or not, correct?</p>  <p>The reason I want to do this is for situations when I am working for few days on something I can't commit yet, but there's something which needs to be fixed related to a previous commit I did.</p>
