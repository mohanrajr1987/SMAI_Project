<p>I am not sure how this happened, but lately my tortoiseSVN shows an alert for every single action I do, and will proceed only if I click on the alert box.</p>  <p>The alert box has a title of TortoiseProc. And the text in the alert is something similar to (Eg for SVN log):</p>  <pre><code>/command:log /path "c:\xampp\htdocs\MyProject" /hwnd:0000000000025F9C </code></pre>  <p>I read this SO question and some online forums as well, but I do not know what I should do in my TortoiseSVN to get rid of these annoying alerts.</p>
