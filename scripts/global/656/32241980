<p>I know this question has been asked many times, but I want to know how to it in netbeans. </p>  <p>I committed some changes, it was correct but I used the wrong account. Now, I need to undo the commit and recommit it using the correct account. How will I do this step by step in netbeans?</p>  <p>Here's the log of the wrong commit that I made. I want to be as sure as possible because this project is already running for several months already I dont want to ruin what my colleagues already made.  </p>  <pre><code> Revision: 170   Author  : wrongAuthor   Date    : 08 27, 15 1:39:38 PM  Migrated employee module to the new architecture.
