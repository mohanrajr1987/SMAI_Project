<p>I have some png files in an SVN repository. The files end with the extension <code>.PNG</code> rather than <code>.png</code>. This causes some issues on some operating systems where the images don't show up. When I rename the <code>.PNG</code> images to <code>.png</code>, I try to add and commit them using TortoiseSVN but it doesn't see them as <em>modified</em> so I can't commit anything and in my file explorer they just change back to the capitalized version without me doing anything. I'm guessing they get updated because the file isn't actually considered to be changed when you rename the extension to a non-capitalized version of itself.</p>  <p>What should I do in this situation?</p>
