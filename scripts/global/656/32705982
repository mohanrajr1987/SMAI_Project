<p>I have have the following repo structure:</p>  <pre><code> /root  ----/API  ---------ReusableClass1.vb  ----/MyProject  ---------/source  -------------SomeFile.vb  -------------ReusableClass1.vb (to update with revisions to above ReusableClass1.vb) </code></pre>  <p>Question: How can I create some sort of<code>ReusableClass1.vb</code> branch that lives in the API branch (the true owner of the file) but also keep a copy of it in MyProject directory? I would like to "pull" the updates to the MyProjct source directory periodically, but the revisions to be always up to date in the <code>/API</code> directory?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
