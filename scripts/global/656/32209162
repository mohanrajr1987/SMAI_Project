<p>I am using svn command line to export individual file from svn repository. When I am doing this "Svn export" from my computer where I am the Administrator it works fine (I am exporting files <strong>using svn command line and it's being called from c# program</strong>). But when someone else doing this operation from different computer where the person is not the "Administrator" of the PC, i am getting this error </p>  <blockquote>   <p>SVN Export error : svn: Can't move tempfile.tmp to c:\xxx folder.   Access Denied.</p> </blockquote>  <p>only when i am exporting individual file.</p>  <p>I did lots of google search and most of the people are pointing it to Antivirus issues and folder access issues. Since i am working in a controlled environment so I will not be able to "stop" antivirus. Second option is folder permission on the local folder which I have verified and I have the full access to that folder which means it's not a folder access issue.</p>  <p>Could anyone please advise how to resolve this ?</p>
