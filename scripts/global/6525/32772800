<p>I know there is the <code>reduced</code> function to terminate such an infinite thing, but i am curious why in the second version (with <code>range</code> without arg) it doesn't terminate the reduction as it reaches 150?    </p>  <pre><code>user=&gt; (reduce (fn [a v] (if (&lt; a 100) (+ a v) a)) (range 2000)) 105 user=&gt; (reduce (fn [a v] (if (&lt; a 100) (+ a v) a)) (range)) </code></pre>
