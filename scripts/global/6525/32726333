<p>This is a simple problem but nonetheless, I am stuck. So let's say I have an input vector with negatives, zeros and positive numbers.</p>  <pre><code>[-1 -1 -2 -1 -4 0 -6 -1 -5 -2 -10 **4** -12 -4 -6 -1 -16 **3** -18 **2** -10 -8 -22 **12** -19 -10 -14 0 -28 **12** -30 -1 -18 -14 -22 **19** -36 -16 -22 **10** -40 **12** -42 -4 -12 -20 -46 **28** -41 -7] </code></pre>  <p>And I want to return a vector of the indices of the previous vectors, where the value is a positive.</p>  <p>So the return value would be </p>  <pre><code> (11 17 19 23 29 35 39 41 47) </code></pre>  <p>11 is the index of where the 4 sits, 17 is the index of where the 3 is, etc</p>  <p>I am using .indexOF</p>  <p>and this is what it is returning:      (11 17 19 23 23 35 39 23 47)</p>  <p>I figured that b/c at index 23, the positive value is 12, and at index 29, the value is also 12, so it is just returning the index where it first sees the positive value of "12" But how can I get around this?</p>  <p>I've read through the thread <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4830900/how-do-i-find-the-index-of-an-item-in-a-vector">How do I find the index of an item in a vector?</a> But I am still struggling since that one seems to talk about how to find the indices of "two" in a vector if you are looking for "two" specifically.</p>
