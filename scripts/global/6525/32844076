<p>This is probably a common problem or I shouldn't be using flatten but I dont exactly understand whats happening?</p>  <p>The idea is to take a two-dimensions Vector <code>[[x][y][z]]</code> and return a single dimensional collection (dont really care what form for now e.g. <code>(x y z)</code> and <code>[x y z]</code> are both fine for now.</p>  <p>However if I do the following (<code>subbed</code> is the 2d vector:</p>  <pre><code>(let [flat-coll (flatten subbed)                                  header-less (subvec flat-coll 0 (count flat-coll))] ... )    </code></pre>  <p>The value of <code>flat-col</code> is <code>realized = 0</code>, and I was expecting it to be the value of the flattened collection.</p>  <p>I guess its down to it being Lazy, is there a 'better' way to achieve what I want?</p>
