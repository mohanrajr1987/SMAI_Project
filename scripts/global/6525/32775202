<p>These both work:</p>  <pre><code>=&gt; (def hash {:a "potato" :b "pants"}) #'hash =&gt; (hash :a) "potato" =&gt; (:a hash) "potato" </code></pre>  <p>Is there any reason I should prefer one of these over the other?  I see more people doing the latter <code>(:a hash)</code>... why?  I like the former <code>(hash :a)</code> because it resembles the structure of <code>(-&gt; hash :a :b :c)</code>, which I prefer to the noisier <code>(get-in hash [:a :b :c])</code>.</p>  <p>Is there some efficiency difference or something between these?</p>
