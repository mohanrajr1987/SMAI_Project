<p>Consider this very simple function definition in clojure:</p>  <pre><code>(defn prompt []   (print "&gt;&gt;&gt; ")   (read-line)) </code></pre>  <p>My ambition is to let the user enter a string prepended by a prompt-prefix. However, it seems like <code>read-line</code> gets executed before the <code>print</code> statement. However, by flushing the output stream</p>  <pre><code>(defn prompt []   (print "&gt;&gt;&gt; ")   (flush)   (read-line)) </code></pre>  <p>This function works as intended. Why do I manually have to flush <em>out</em> in order for ">>> " to be written out? According to the docs, functions and <code>do</code> should execute expressions in order.</p>
