<p>I am writing a library for clojure which involves native code. How can I bundle the shared library (aka native dependencies) when I deploy the clojure libraries to public repositories (like clojars)?</p>  <h2>Further Info:</h2>  <p>My project structure looks roughly like:</p>  <pre><code>src/     native/     - C code , C Object files and compiled shared libs     java/       - Java stuff     clojure/    - Clojure stuff </code></pre>  <p>I am currently using leineingen. I have tried doing:</p>  <pre><code>:jvm-opts [~(str "-Djava.library.path=src/native/:"           (System/getenv "$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"))] </code></pre>  <p>It works if I am in the project. However, if I include this project as a dependency, I will get a <code>UnsatisfiedLink</code> error.</p>
