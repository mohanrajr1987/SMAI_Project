<p>If i want to call java methodes or fields in clojure i can use the dot special form, since clojure strings are implemented as java strings i think i should be able to call the String methodes of java by something like (.toUpperCase "clojure") which works. My question is why can i not access to all of the java Methods in the same manner? For example <code>(.valueOf 3)</code> which is <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#valueOf%28int%29" rel="nofollow">this</a> static method gives me an error.</p>
