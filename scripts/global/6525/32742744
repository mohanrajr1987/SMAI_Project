<p>I'm making a GET request using clj-http and the response is a zip file. The contents of this zip is always one CSV file. I want to save the CSV file to disk, but I can't figure out how.</p>  <p>If I have the file on disk, <code>(fs/unzip filename destination)</code> from the Raynes/fs library works great, but I can't figure out how I can coerce the response from clj-http into something this can read. If possible, I'd like to unzip the file directly without </p>  <p>The closest I've gotten (if this is even close) gets me to a BufferedInputStream, but I'm lost from there.</p>  <pre><code>(require '[clj-http.client :as client]) (require '[clojure.java.io :as io])  (-&gt;   (client/get "http://localhost:8000/blah.zip" {:as :byte-array})   (:body)   (io/input-stream)) </code></pre>
