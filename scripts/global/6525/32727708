<p>Looking for simplest or most idiomatic way to deal with input that may either be a simple keyword or a vector of keywords.  Perhaps a function that converts a plain keyword to a list.  Trying to avoid an if clause, and also trying to avoid too much function chaining.</p>  <pre><code> (defn togethr [v1]    (into [] (flatten (into [:a] (vector v1))))   (togethr :b)   ; =&gt; [:a :b]   (togethr [:b :c])  ; =&gt; [:a :b :c] </code></pre>  <p>Here I'm chaining 4 function calls and I suspect there is an easier (more idiomatic) way.</p>
