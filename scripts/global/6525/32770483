<p>Can anyone explain why <code>sort-by</code> is reacting like this with these keyfunctions? </p>  <pre><code>user=&gt; (sort-by number? [1 2 13 4 "s" 0 "a"]) ("s" "a" 1 2 13 4 0)  user=&gt; (sort-by str [1 2 3 4 "s" 0 "a"]) (0 1 2 3 4 "a" "s") </code></pre>  <p>My idea is its dividing the args of the vector into strings and numbers? Is there anything more about what's happening here?  And my second question does <code>sort-by</code> travel through every item of the vector and then returning the result?</p>
