<p>I'm in a situation where I need to traverse a table (precisely 2D array) in java to produce the desired output. I'm just giving a few samples which might show you an overview of exact requirement.</p>  <p>AA AB    =  AA&amp;&amp;AB</p>  <p>AA AB<br> AC AD   =  (AA&amp;&amp;AB)||(AC&amp;&amp;AD)</p>  <p>AA AB</p>  <p>AA AC   =   AA&amp;&amp;(AB||AC)                </p>  <p>AA  AB<br> AC  AC  =    (AA &amp;&amp; AB)||(AC)           </p>  <p>AA AB AD</p>  <p>AC AB AE     = (AA || AC) &amp;&amp; AB &amp;&amp; (AD || AE)   </p>  <p>AA  AB  AD</p>  <p>AD  AA  AB = (AA &amp;&amp; AB &amp;&amp; AD) || (AD &amp;&amp; AA &amp;&amp; AB)   </p>  <p>And so on. It means that this has to check next element in table and below element to club and extract as a common.</p>  <p>I need some help as this is a complex thing and none of the algo's written have been successfully run the dry test.</p>  <p>Primarily I've to create an algo for this and then have to go with implementation using java.</p>  <p>Thanks:-</p>
