<p>I have a services table, with different service types. However, depending on the service, I'd like to have a user fill out a particular web form. </p>  <p>For example, two service types could be "web development" and "web design". Depending on the service they choose, they'll fill out a different form. There are some overlapping fields, but they also have their own specific fields. </p>  <p>I figure I could have the form be an entity, rather than putting all the columns into the services table. So there would be a service with a "service_form_id" of some sort. </p>  <p>There were two ways I thought I could go about doing this. Now keep in mind that the "forms" have different columns or fields. Regardless of the method, I would have a single services table and a services_type table, and then: </p>  <ol> <li>I could create a single table for all the forms, and all the fields. This means that columns will end up being null where the different service types don't have any overlap.</li> <li>I create separate form entities for each service type. So one table could be web_dev_forms and the other web_design_forms. The issue I had here was that I'm not sure how to tie the service back to the proper "form". The only way I could come up with at the moment is doing an inner join on the service_id across all the "form" tables, in which only one should match back up. But I'm not really fond of that idea.</li> </ol>  <p>Actually, I'm not too fond of either idea! I'm sure someone must have run across a situation like this before, so I'm interesting in getting some perspective on this. Any direction or ideas would be appreciated.</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
