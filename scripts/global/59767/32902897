<p>I am trying to sort a polynomial stored in a linked list by descending degrees, but this algorithm seems to miss the last node of the linked list, so the last term of the polynomial is always unsorted. Does anyone know how to fix this? </p>  <pre><code>Node prev = mult.poly; //mult.poly is a pointer to the first node of the polynomial linked list  Node curr = mult.poly.next;      do{         if (curr.term.degree &lt; prev.term.degree){ //compare degrees             int temp2 = curr.term.degree;                          curr.term.degree = prev.term.degree;                    prev.term.degree = temp2;                                float temp3 = curr.term.coeff;             curr.term.coeff = prev.term.coeff;             prev.term.coeff = temp3;              prev = mult.poly;             curr = mult.poly.next;         }           prev = prev.next;         curr = curr.next;     } while(curr!=null);      return mult; } </code></pre>
