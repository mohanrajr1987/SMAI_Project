<p>I am writing a java program of creating and storing the linked list in a file. So after I create the linked list, I want to store it in a file and close my console, and again when I read that file I should get same linked list with the links between each nodes retained, but I am unable to perform that. So does anybody has idea about storing a linked list in any file with the links retained for future use.</p>  <p>Thanks in advanced.</p>
