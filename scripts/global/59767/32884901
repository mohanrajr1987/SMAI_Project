<p>Recently I took part in a java coding challenge in my college and was asked this problem which I found difficult to implement.</p>  <p>Problem was to implement a method <code>detect</code> that given two <code>LinkedList</code>, return the index where second list is sublist of first.</p>  <pre><code>detect((1,2,3),(2,3)) should return 1 </code></pre>  <p>The node structure to the list was</p>  <pre><code>LinkedListNode {    String val;    LinkedListNode *next; } </code></pre>  <p>and the method signature</p>  <pre><code>static int detect(LinkedListNode list, LinkedListNode sublist) </code></pre>  <p>What would be the basic algorithm to approach this problem. I am a newbie to data structures.</p>
