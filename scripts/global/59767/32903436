<p>I have an HDF5 dataset, generated by MATLAB, which one of its datasets is of size [1 12672 1 220000] following the pattern: [height width channel NumberOfInstances]. In other words, I have 220000 vector samples reshaped into an 4-D data structure. Now, I want to read the first elements of all vector samples in MATLAB and do some operations, say average, on them. Here is the thing that I tried (not sure if it is correct), but I got into a pool of errors:</p>  <pre><code>data = h5read('trial.h5','/data',[1 1 1 1],[220000,1,1,220000]); </code></pre>  <p>Any help is appreciated.</p>
