<p>I recently encountered this problem in an interview </p>  <p>There are <code>n</code> stairs, a person standing at the bottom wants to reach the top. The person can climb either 1 stair or 2 stairs at a time.</p>  <p>Print all possible ways person can reach the top.</p>  <p>For example, <code>n=4</code> Output: </p>  <pre><code>1 2 3 4 1 2 4 1 3 4 2 3 4 2 4 </code></pre>  <p>But I couldn't code this properly. How to code up solution for this?</p>
