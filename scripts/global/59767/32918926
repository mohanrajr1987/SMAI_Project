<p>Given only access to a node to be deleted in a singly linked list, to delete it, I'm see solutions that suggest to use a temp node (here n is the node of interest)</p>  <pre><code>    LinkedListNode temp = n.next;      n.data = temp.data;      n.next = temp.next;  </code></pre>  <p>I'm wondering why can't I just do this? :</p>  <pre><code>    n.data = n.next.data;     n.next = n.next.next; </code></pre>  <p>Also, it's suggested that this method(the top one) doesn't work if the node were the last in the list. To handle this case, would this work?</p>  <pre><code>    LinkedListNode temp = n.next;      if (temp == null) {         n = null;     } else {     n.data = temp.data;      n.next = temp.next;}  </code></pre>
