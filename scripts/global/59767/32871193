<p>I am taking an AI course, and the very first problem we are assigned is to create a program to solve the sliding brick puzzle. </p>  <p>Now, our professor hasn't given us any information on how to approach this. I am two classes in and all we covered is the definition of AI, and Agents.</p>  <p>I am completely lost with how to approach this problem. We are given text files that represent a board, and my code is already set up to translate the board as a 2d array, print it out, etc. (the easy stuff). But now I need to work towards actually solving it which I am clueless about.</p>  <p>Here is an example of a board:</p>  <pre><code>1,1,1,1,1,1, 1,3,2,2,4,1, 1,5,2,2,6,1, 1,7,7,8,8,1, 1,9,9,10,10,1, 1,0,0,0,0,1, 1,0,0,0,0,1, 1,1,-1,-1,1,1, </code></pre>  <p><code>1</code> represents a wall</p>  <p><code>0</code> represents blank space</p>  <p><code>-1</code> represents winning area</p>  <p><code>2</code> represents the "special block"</p>  <p>Anything <code>greater than 2</code> is a "non special" block</p>  <p>Does anyone know what algorithms I could use to approach this problem with? Or possibly a good resource.</p>  <p>Here is an example of the game itself: <a href="http://www.mathplayground.com/slidingblock.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mathplayground.com/slidingblock.html</a></p>
