<p>I am trying to create a new type of <strong>MMORTS game</strong>.</p>  <h2>Current Situation</h2>  <p><strong>Everyday each user deletes and creates</strong> : 1,500 rows of data in diff. tables but in 1 database (all tables data are inter-related to data of other tables)<br> <strong>Each Row estimated size</strong> : 1KB<br> <strong>Max user per database</strong> : 100,000 users<br> <strong>Total Space Consumed everyday</strong> : 0.15 TB</p>  <p><strong>Actual Users in the Game</strong> : 10,000,000 users (split in different databases)<br><br></p>  <h2>Problem</h2>  <p>According to me if I delete a row in SQL it is not being deleted permanently and will still consume space in the database. If this happens, then in near future all my server are likely to crash. </p>  <p>Can anyone tell me if i am going wrong anywhere or suggest me any solution to this problem? I know this question cannot be understood easily so please feel free to ask any doubts you have regarding this question.</p>
