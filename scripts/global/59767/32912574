<p>I've been put on a project that saves all the data sent by a user as a blob in an SQL table, but they modify the data sent by us before storing it in the table.</p>  <p>A request like <code>www.somewebsite.com/request?id=3&amp;color=ffffff</code></p>  <p>gets stored as <code>a:3:{s:7:"request";s:0:"";s:2:"id";s:3:"290";s:5:"color";s:6:"ffffff";}</code> </p>  <p>So why are they storing everything with some kind of header that tells the length of the data? What is the name for this type of structure?</p>
