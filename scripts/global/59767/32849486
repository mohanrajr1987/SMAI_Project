<p>Background:  I am currently working on writing a method that adds two polynomials (given by 2 text files) together. So for example:</p>  <p>4.0x^5 + -2.0x^3 + 2.0x + 3.0</p>  <p>&amp;</p>  <p>8.0x^4 + 4.0x^3 + -3.0x + 9.0</p>  <p>would result in: 4.0x^5 + 8.0x^4 + 2.0x^3 - 1.0x + 12</p>  <p>Currently, my output only produces: 8.0 x^4 + 4.0x^5 + 2.0x^3 - 1.0x + 12 -- this is because of the order of my for loops which you can see below. I need the terms to be in order. </p>  <pre><code>Polynomial answer = new Polynomial();       //p = addZeroes(p);        for (Node firstPoly = poly; firstPoly != null; firstPoly = firstPoly.next){         boolean polyAdded = false;         for (Node secondPoly = p.poly; secondPoly != null; secondPoly = secondPoly.next){              if (firstPoly.term.degree == secondPoly.term.degree){              answer = addToRear(answer, (firstPoly.term.coeff + secondPoly.term.coeff), firstPoly.term.degree, null);                     if (answer.poly.term.coeff == 0){                         answer.poly = null;                     }                     polyAdded = true;               }           }         if (polyAdded == false){         answer = addToRear(answer, firstPoly.term.coeff, firstPoly.term.degree, null);         if (answer.poly.term.coeff == 0){             answer.poly = null;         }         }      }      for (Node secondPoly = p.poly; secondPoly != null; secondPoly = secondPoly.next){         boolean match = false;         for (Node answerPoly = answer.poly; answerPoly != null; answerPoly = answerPoly.next){             if (secondPoly.term.degree == answerPoly.term.degree){                 match = true;                 break;             }           }         if (match == false){         answer = addToRear(answer, secondPoly.term.coeff, secondPoly.term.degree, null);         }     }        return answer;      //alt + shift + r    } </code></pre>  <p>Thank you.</p>
