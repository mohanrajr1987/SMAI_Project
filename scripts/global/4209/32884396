<p>I've got a Code Igniter controller which reads the uploaded record file (excel, csv, tsv, xml, etc) and writes each line as a record into the database. The record ID which is the first column in the file should be unique. If it is already present in the database then while reading the file I should throw an alert and depending on the user's response I will override or skip the record and continue with the other records. </p>  <p>But once I throw the alert and reach the view, I loose the control of the controller and I don't know to keep the file pointer ticking so that I can continue to read after receiving the response from the user. </p>  <p>Is there a work around for this or do we have an other alternative method?</p>
