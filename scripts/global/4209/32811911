<p>In my project, I have a HTML page which has input <code>type="file"</code>. I am trying to send this file to a Rest service. Whenever I am sending using form submit, I am getting some data to my rest service which is in Java. But the file is corrupt as it has some byte data which is invalid. </p>  <p>I have tried following enctype:</p>  <pre><code>1: "multipart/form-data" 2: "application/zip" </code></pre>  <p>I found some <code>PHP</code> example where they have given enctype as <code>multipart/form-data</code>. But in my case, it's not working. </p>  <p>In my rest service, I have given <code>@Consumes("multipart/form-data")</code>. </p>  <p><strong>HTML Code:</strong></p>  <pre><code>&lt;form id="upload" action="rest/deployMetadata2/upload" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data"&gt;     &lt;input type="file" id="fleupload"/&gt;     &lt;input type="submit" /&gt; &lt;/form&gt; </code></pre>  <p><strong>Rest Service</strong></p>  <pre><code>@Path("/deployMetadata2") public class DeployMetadata2 {     File zipFile;     @POST     @Path("/upload")     @Consumes(MediaType.MULTIPART_FORM_DATA)     @Produces("application/json") </code></pre>  <p>Can someone please help me with correct enctype or way to send zip file to Rest Service? If possible, please paste the code or if there is any plugin from Jquery or so, please let me know. Thanks in advance.</p>
