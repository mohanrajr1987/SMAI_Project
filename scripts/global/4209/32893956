<p>so I have been stuck with this problem for quite some time and I have just ignored it until it is becoming a bigger issue. When uploading an image, about 80% of the times it will upload it and detect it, but that other 20% will randomly not detect the image (its always the same image). I took 4 random pictures with my phone, 2 of them upload fine, and the other 2 get an error.</p>  <p>using <code>print_r($_FILES)</code> - it shows me where I am getting the error for the two pictures, but I don't have a clue how to fix this.</p>  <p>ERROR upload files (2 examples):</p>  <pre><code>Array([file]=&gt;Array([name]=&gt;1.jpg **[type]=&gt;[tmp_name]=&gt;[error]=&gt;1** [size]=&gt;0))  Array([file]=&gt;Array([name]=&gt;2015-07-31 16.25.59-1.jpg **[type]=&gt; [tmp_name] =&gt; [error]=&gt;1**[size]=&gt;0)) </code></pre>  <p>CORRECT upload files (2 examples):</p>  <pre><code>Array([file] =&gt; Array ( [name] =&gt; 2015-07-31 16.26.43-1.jpg **[type] =&gt; image/jpeg [tmp_name] =&gt; C:\xampp\tmp\phpFB57.tmp [error] =&gt; 0** [size] =&gt; 1871686 ) )  Array([file] =&gt; Array ( [name] =&gt; 2015-07-31 16.26.22.jpg **[type] =&gt; image/jpeg [tmp_name] =&gt; C:\xampp\tmp\php5FDF.tmp [error] =&gt; 0** [size] =&gt; 1747067 ) ) </code></pre>  <p>Looking at the ERROR upload, it is detecting an error due to the tmp_name issuing a type to it, it is just blank. (I bolded it)</p>  <p>How come some of my images are not uploading doing the exact same thing while some upload? (using same camera - all landscape photos)</p>
