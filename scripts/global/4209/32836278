<p>I am still in learning on doing php coding and now,I am facing a problem. Here is a php coding to compile up to four PDF files into a single PDF but no matter how many files I put in it will only compile 2 files. Could anyone help me see where is the problem as I need to pass up this project pretty soon. It will be a big help if some let me know where I should change.</p>  <p>Here is the coding:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php   include 'PDFMerger.php';  $pdf = new PDFMerger;  $uploaddir = "upload/uploaded/";  //set this to where your files should be uploaded.   $i = 1; $j = 1;  if (isset($_FILES['file'])) {        foreach($_FILES['file']['type'] as $key =&gt; $value) {       $ispdf = end(explode(".",$_FILES['file']['name'][$key]));  //make sure it's a PDF file          $ispdf = strtolower($ispdf);           if ($value &amp;&amp; $ispdf=='pdf') {              //upload each file to the server              $filename = $i . '.' . 'pdf';              $filename = str_replace(" ","",$filename); //remove spaces from file name              $uploadfile = $uploaddir . $filename;              move_uploaded_file($_FILES['file']['tmp_name'][$key], $uploadfile);              $i++;             $j++;          }       }       if ($j = 2) {         goto first;     }      else {         if ($j = 3) {            goto second;         }          else {         goto third;         }     }        first:   $pdf-&gt;addPDF('upload/uploaded/1.pdf')     -&gt;addPDF('upload/uploaded/2.pdf')     -&gt;merge('download', 'compiler.pdf');     goto end;     second: $pdf-&gt;addPDF('upload/uploaded/1.pdf')     -&gt;addPDF('upload/uploaded/2.pdf')     -&gt;addPDF('upload/uploaded/3.pdf')     -&gt;merge('download', 'compiler.pdf');     goto end;     third: $pdf-&gt;addPDF('upload/uploaded/1.pdf')             -&gt;addPDF('upload/uploaded/2.pdf')             -&gt;addPDF('upload/uploaded/3.pdf')             -&gt;addPDF('upload/uploaded/4.pdf')             -&gt;merge('download', 'compiler.pdf');         goto end;    }  end: $myFile = "upload/uploaded/1.pdf"; unlink($myFile);  $myFile = "upload/uploaded/2.pdf"; unlink($myFile);  $myFile = "upload/uploaded/3.pdf"; unlink($myFile);  $myFile = "upload/uploaded/4.pdf"; unlink($myFile);  ?&gt;  </code></pre>
