<p>I have a script that someone wrote for me that saves an image with text to a database and is then called to another page to create a gallery. Since the code was written, the person who wrote it has disappeared and I'm left without someone to alter it - so I turn to you guys in hopes that someone may be able to help me since it's a bit over my head.</p>  <p>This inserts the data into the DB       <pre><code>//connect to the database// //include database connection include 'mysqlconnect.php';    if ($_FILES["image"]["error"] &gt; 0)   {     //Bad Output for form results red text      echo "&lt;font size = '5'&gt;&lt;font color=\"#e31919\"&gt;Error: NO CHOSEN FILE &lt;br /&gt;";      echo"&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size = '5'&gt;&lt;font color=\"#e31919\"&gt;INSERT TO DATABASE FAILED";    }    else    {      move_uploaded_file($_FILES["image"]["tmp_name"],"images/" . $_FILES["image"]["name"]);        $file="images/".$_FILES["image"]["name"];      $image_title = addslashes($_REQUEST['image_title']);      $sql="INSERT INTO images (name, image, description) VALUES ('','$file','$image_title')";       if (!mysql_query($sql))      {         die('Error: ' . mysql_error());      }      //Good Output for form results green text         echo 'Success!';     }     mysql_close();  ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>And this displays the data on the gallery page</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php      //connect to the database//     //include database connection     include 'mysqlconnect.php';      $sql="select * from images order by image desc";     $query=mysql_query($sql);     while($row=mysql_fetch_array($query))     {     $image=$row ['image'];     $description=$row ['description'];          //call all images from DB     echo '         &lt;a class="img-thumb" href="'.$image.'" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="'.$description.'" style="background-image:url('.$image.');"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; '; } ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>All I want to do is rotate the images before uploading to the database -OR- before it's output onto the page. Unfortunately using CSS doesn't help me in this situation. Any guidance is helpful - thanks.</p>
