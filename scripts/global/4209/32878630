<p>I have coded PHP script for uploading JPEG file. It works for uploading but when I open that file, it show that </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Photo Gallery can't open this photo because you do not have   permission to access the file location</p> </blockquote>  <p>How can I set the permission after uploading code for Windows?</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php $target_dir = "/fileUpload";  $name = $_POST['txtname'];  $target_file = $target_dir . basename($name) . ".jpg"; $imageupload = $_FILES['file1']['tmp_name'];    if(move_uploaded_file($_FILES['file1']['tmp_name'],$target_file)){     //for linux, chmod($target_file, 0777);     //for windows?     echo("yes"); }else{     echo("no"); } ?&gt; </code></pre>
