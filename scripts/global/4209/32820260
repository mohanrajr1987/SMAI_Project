<p>I'm thinking using S3 Amazon for storage (if you guys have better one, don't hesitate to recommend). I could do a normal file upload, but let's say I'm uploading a very large video/music file (something > 20mb), I will hit php upload maxfilesize.</p>  <p>Yes I can just set <code>php_max_filesize</code> value but I am thinking something else.</p>  <p>How to break those files into smaller chunks, and upload each chunks (like how you download torrent files, they each have the download chunks)? And stopping and continuing them anytime the user wants?</p>  <p>This (<a href="http://www.hjsplit.org/php/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hjsplit.org/php/</a>) does not work, because it needs to read the file <strong>ON THE SERVER</strong> first, before uploading it, so it's useless. Are there any Laravel/PHP/JS library for this?</p>  <p>Or, I wonder how youtube did it?</p>
