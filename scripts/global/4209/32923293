<p>I have a web form with type=file input for file upload. However, if the user selects a shortcut in windows, it uploads the shortcut file instead of the actual file (shortcut target).</p>  <p>It is possible to detect that the user has selected shortcut - eg. by filename extension "lnk". But how do I (by javascript) automatically upload the target file instead of the shortcut?</p>
