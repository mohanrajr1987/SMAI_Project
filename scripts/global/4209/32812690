<p>I have a situation where I need to store file information (a <code>File</code> object) in a variable, but I'm required to <code>JSON.stringify</code> it first. This doesn't work on <code>File</code> objects:</p>  <pre><code>&gt; JSON.stringify(new File([], null)) Â« "{}" </code></pre>  <p>So what I need to do is, take a file that a user uploaded, convert it to a plain object, store it in string format, and then later be able to pull that string, <code>JSON.parse</code> it, and convert it back into a <code>File</code>. Converting it into a plain object is simple enough, but getting it back to a <code>File</code> object is something I've  been unsuccessful at finding any way to accomplish.</p>  <p>Added clarification:</p>  <p>So let's say I've copied the properties of my <code>File</code> into a plain object:</p>  <pre><code>{   "lastModified": 1443077616000,   "lastModifiedDate": "2015-09-24T06:53:36.000Z",   "name": "Action Items.zip",   "size": 3619135,   "type": "application/zip" } </code></pre>  <p>I just need to convert this back into a <code>File</code> object.</p>
