<p>I am using sails version 0.11 which comes bundled with skipper for file uploads. I need to upload big files of over 100 MB in size at least. </p>  <p>Now I don't want the file upload to complete before I start further processing of the file on server. I want to read the file stream while it is being uploaded. Here is how I am trying to achieve the same:</p>  <pre><code>var csv = require("fast-csv");  bulk: function (req, res){    function parseEntry(entry){     return entry   }     var inputStream = req.file('employees');   var csvStream = csv();   inputStream.pipe(csvStream);     csvStream.on("data", function (data){     count++     // skip invalid records     var parsedData = parseEntry(data);     console.log(parsedData);   });    csvStream.on("end", function(){     // console.log("total time taken in minutes:", timeTaken);     return res.json(200, {"status": 1, "message": "successfully uploaded the file"});   });  } </code></pre>  <p>But my logs only show up the end event and no data event is being captured. I read in the documentation that <code>req.file("filename")</code> will return stream of file streams. But how do I access the particular file stream I need since I am only uploading a single file? </p>
