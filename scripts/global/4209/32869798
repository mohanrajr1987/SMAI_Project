<p>I want to post a photo comment using facebook graph api and i need to make a post request and one of the fields is source and the type is multipart/form-data, I have my html form </p>  <pre><code>    &lt;form class="reply"&gt;       &lt;input type="file" id="fileUploader"&gt;     &lt;/form&gt; </code></pre>  <p>and in my controller i have a file object of the file uploaded</p>  <pre><code>     var file = template.find('#fileUploader').files[0];      HTTP.post("https://graph.facebook.com/" + targetId + "/comments?message=" +  text + "&amp;source="+file+"&amp;access_token=" + accessToken, function(err, response) {   console.log(response); }); </code></pre>  <p>so my problem is I cant pass the file object like this, it needs to be as I said  multipart/form-data. Is this as simple as converting the file and placing the result in my http post request or do I need to use FormData or XMLHttpRequest. I dont need to actually upload the file on my server and I would like to keep the logic very simple</p>
