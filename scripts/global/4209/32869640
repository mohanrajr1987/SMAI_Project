<p>I'm trying to implement blueimp's fileupload widget in our product as a generic attachment uploader. The widget works well on it's own I'm wondering if there is a way to use an external ajax call rather using the widget's built in function. The concept is to use Backbone for the modules in the product and send the files with ajax. I can use the fileupload to to save my model and the files but it feels weird to do this:</p>  <pre><code>var filesList;  var f = $('#fileupload').fileupload({     url: 'api/faqs/save' });  f.on("fileuploadadd", function(e, data){     filesList.push(data.files[0]); });  $("button").click(function(e){     f.fileupload('send', {files:filesList}); }); </code></pre>  <p>My aim would be to use something like this</p>  <pre><code>$('#fileupload').fileupload(); //(...) $.ajax(     url: 'api/faqs/save',     data: {         question: model.get('question'),         answer: model.get('answer'),         files: filesList     } ); </code></pre>  <p>This solution didn't work for me as it doesn't seem to send the correct payload to the server. I might be missing a content-type setting or multipart option. Anyone did something similar before? How do you normally use the upload for data entries?</p>
