<p>I am new to ruby on rails, and need an upload image and upload file control. I saw this (<a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/134-paperclip" rel="nofollow">http://railscasts.com/episodes/134-paperclip</a>) and it is what I need. But for the image resizing feature, it says it needs imagemagick.  I have been basically all day trying to install this, following multiple tutorials which are pretty much like this (<a href="https://github.com/rmagick/rmagick/wiki/Installing-on-Windows" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/rmagick/rmagick/wiki/Installing-on-Windows</a>), or telling me to use the rmagick gem from rubyforge.org (which seems to be down since 2013). </p>  <p>When I follow the instructions I always get the following error when running gem install rmagick:</p>  <pre><code>ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension. Could not create Makefile due to some reason, probably lack of necessary libraries and/or header. </code></pre>  <p>Could anyone please point me to an up to date tutorial or way of installing imagemagick? Or am I using something too old, I read on a post it has not been committed for years on github?</p>  <p>Also, if there is a better and easier way to upload files and images with rails, suggestions are welcome, as I don't HAVE to use paperclip and imagemagick.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
