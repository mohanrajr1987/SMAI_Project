<p>How would I denote a REST API using API Blueprint that is similar to the  <a href="https://developers.google.com/drive/web/manage-uploads" rel="nofollow">Google Drive API</a></p>  <p>I'm expecting uploads of all different kinds of files so I see drive handles "multipart" uploads. I'd likely need to do something similar to that too. </p>  <p>How would this look in API Blueprint markdown?</p>  <p>I noticed that there isn't like a "file" primative, but there are headers? I'm pretty new to API Blueprint.</p>
