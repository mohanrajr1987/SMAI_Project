<p>I want to learn more about operating systems by experimentation and would like to implement my own, simple drawing system and later window server in C. I'm thinking about doing that on top of Ubuntu Linux. My problem is I can't seem to find the right information, it's all about window managers on top of X11, or about configuring Linux to not use a screen's text mode.</p>  <p>I'm assuming I'd need access to the screen's back buffer, but I'm not sure how I'd do that. <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/fb/framebuffer.txt" rel="nofollow">https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/fb/framebuffer.txt</a> describes the "fb" device, is that what I would use to switch from console into direct back buffer access mode?</p>  <p>Does anybody have a minimal example/documentation that shows how to use fb from C, e.g. to get from a command-line app to a filled white screen?</p>
