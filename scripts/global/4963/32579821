<p>assume a loop that is running on its own thread. somewhere in the loop statement I have a condition to check. If the condition returns True then I need to open a new dialog window with 2 options for the user to select. the new dialog window must block the new and main thread to prevent user navigation to the system until the user select its option.  I was able to complete this when I was using windows forms with the following code</p>  <pre><code> Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click     Dim thr As New System.Threading.Thread(AddressOf start)     thr.Start() End Sub  Private Sub start()     For i As Integer = 0 To 10000         'Do some tasks here          '         '         '         '         '         If TobeAskUser = True Then             Dim win As New Form             Me.Invoke(New MethodInvoker(AddressOf win.ShowDialog))             If win.DialogResult = Windows.Forms.DialogResult.OK Then                 Continue For             Else                 Exit Sub             End If         End If     Next End Sub </code></pre>  <p>**Now am with WPF and after several ways I could not make it happen **.</p>  <p>EDIT the following code will work for the wpf. but not sure if I am doing it correct</p>  <pre><code> Dim win As New ReplaceFileAttachment ' &lt;- this is a window Private Sub Start()     For i As Integer = 0 To 1000         'do some task here         '         '         '         '         If IsSelected = True Then             Me.Dispatcher.Invoke(DirectCast(Sub() win = New Window, Action))             Me.Dispatcher.Invoke(DirectCast(Sub() win.ShowDialog(), Action))             'the dialog above will be open and block and the new thread and the main thread. so the user canot navigate around the system until it close it             Select Case win.CustomDialog  '&lt;- custom dialog it's a custom enum property.                 Case ReplaceFileAttachment.customDialog_.AddAsNew                 Case ReplaceFileAttachment.customDialog_.Cancel                 Case ReplaceFileAttachment.customDialog_.Replace             End Select         End If     Next End Sub </code></pre>
