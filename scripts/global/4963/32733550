<p>I'm going to learn a to develop android apps ( I'm web developer right now ) but I'm confused about the Ide which I should start with. I know android studio is suggested IDE for android development by google. On the other hand, the embarcadero claims that by their IDE you can develop your app for android, IOS, Win10, and mac which sounds really tempting. can any one clarify the pros and cons of each IDE?</p>
