<p>In my Node-Webkit app I use, </p>  <pre><code>imagePicker = gui.Window.open('imagepicker.html?image='+file); </code></pre>  <p>in order to open a new separate child window, from my main app window, where the user can manipulate an image (crop, resize ect.). </p>  <p>When the user is done manipulating the image, I have an "OK" (&amp; "Cancel") button that closes this child window and returns to the main app window. </p>  <p>But problem is that I can't pass back any data from the child window to the main window for further manipulation/info as the Window.close() command does not support any parameters to do that.</p>  <p>Is there any way to do this? Additionally I'd like to be able to detect when the Close button is clicked on the child window so I can ask the user if he wants to save changes or not before closing the window.</p>
