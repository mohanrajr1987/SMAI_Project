<p>How do I check if an explorer is open or not in batch?</p>  <p>I need to take a screenshot of the directory with a file selected, but only after the window has opened. The window title is always the same.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>  <p>Example:</p>  <pre><code>REM Opening folder with a file selected START /W EXPLORER /SELECT,\\10.10.10.10\C$\ThisFolder\FileToHighlight.txt REM Unreliably waiting for window to open TIMEOUT /T 3 /NOBREAK &gt;NUL REM Taking screenshot of window with a third-party app START .\Bin\screenshot-cmd.exe -wt "ThisFolder" -o .\Screenshots\%var%.png </code></pre>
