<p><strong>EDGE build version 20.10240.16384.0</strong></p>  <pre><code>// this code is actually placed inside a JS file whcih is included under parent Window code   var childWindow = window.open(url,'name');  childWindow.focus() ; // this is getting focus when its opened for the first time  </code></pre>  <p>Now in my parent window source, during onFocus or onclick or onKeypress events , Iam restricting the user to operate on parent window unless the childWindow is closed . Iam doing this through JavaScript function (similar to IE showModalDialog functionality which is actually deprecated in chrome) </p>  <pre><code>// parent window code   &lt;body onClick="checkIfChildpopupOpen();"&gt;  function checkIfChildpopupOpen(){    if(childWindow &amp;&amp; !childWindow.closed){    childWindow.focus() // this is not working with EDGE.Child window is not getting focus  } } </code></pre>  <p>Let me know if this is an issue with EDGE as this works perfectly fine in Chrome or IE11.</p>
