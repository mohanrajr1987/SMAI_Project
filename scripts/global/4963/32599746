<p>I'm trying to access a network folder using PHP in windows environment. I have install xampp. here is my code.</p>  <pre><code>$master_path = "\\\\mydir.abc.com\\enu\\px64"; $dh = opendir($master_path); echo "&lt;pre&gt;\n"; var_dump($dh, error_get_last()); echo  "\n&lt;/pre&gt;"; </code></pre>  <p>The folder I'm trying to access is restricted and only can access using my user account. That is the same account I have log in. But it gives me the error <code>The user name or password is incorrect. (code: 1326)</code>.</p>  <p>Is there anyway to specify the username and password while accessing network folders. <strong>My code works fine with not restricted folders.</strong></p>
