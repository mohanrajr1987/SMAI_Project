<p>I'm programming in C and I download code block IDE because it's easier to use. As you know, the minimal code in C is to write: <strong>Hello World</strong> in a CMD window. When I try to launch the program via code block, it works but when I open the <code>.exe</code> file directly, it open and close quickly. Can someone explain me why?</p>  <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;   int main() {      int age = 0;      printf("how old are you?");     scanf("%d", &amp;age);      printf("You are %d", age);      getchar();      return 0;  } </code></pre>
