<p>I have a process in Window, which is process of our own product. Problem is my process is not getting killed. </p>  <p>Product having exe of process is already got uninstalled successfully. So, exe no longer exists still you can see process running in task manager. </p>  <p>I tried all the tools including task manager, process explorer, taskkill, ntsd, but nothing seems to work.</p>  <p>When I check in process explorer, it owns one handle, and even I am not able to close that handle. </p>  <p>Please see image below for more clarity. </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Vy9qv.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Vy9qv.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
