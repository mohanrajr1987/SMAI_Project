<p>I am new to windows form using c#. I have to create a login form and then need to show logged in user relevant data from reading xml. Should I create two different form for login and showing data or should I create only on form and make disappear login control and show data in the same form? If I go with having two forms than how to make disappear login form and show second window form?  </p>
