<p>I am trying to use python to build a bot to play a simple web-based game. I want to use screengrab to "view" the game. I know I can input coordinates into a screengrab, and get only a region of the screen, but I want to do this without having to hard-code the coordinates of the game in relation to the screen so the program will work on different resolution sizes/window positions. Is there any way to do this? Thanks!</p>
