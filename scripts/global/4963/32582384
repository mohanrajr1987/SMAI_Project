<p>I'm trying to learn some JS / Jquery and trying to implementing some functions toghether to learn in how to do it.</p>  <p>My goal is to make a progress bar, that only fires up if while the tab is ative. This function should be thriggered when document ready or after X seconds.</p>  <p>I've already got some of the achievements but it's hard to complete it.</p>  <p>My actual code:</p>  <p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false"> <div class="snippet-code"> <pre class="snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>$(document).ready(function(){      $(window).focus(function(){ 		var progress = $(".loading-progress").progressTimer({ 		timeLimit: 15, 		onFinish: function () { 			alert("ok"); 		}, 		showHtmlSpan: false, 		});      }); });</code></pre> </div> </div> </p>  <p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false"> <div class="snippet-code"> <pre class="snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override"><code>&lt;div class="loading-progress"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   </code></pre> </div> </div> </p>  <p>The main problems: 1 - If I open the page, I need to change the tab and come back to focus and start. The point it's to start right away since the tab is focused. 2 - It doesn't stop if change tab. If I change tab, why the code keeps running since I put into the focus windows code? 3 - I have no clue in how to make it wait X seconds or document ready.</p>  <p>Can someone help me trying to figure it out these 3 aspects? Thanks.</p>
