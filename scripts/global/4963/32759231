<p>Is it possible to remote debug a website running in IE on a Windows tablet? And if yes how can this be done?</p>  <p>I'm looking for something similar to remote debugging on Android and iOS as described here: <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/setup/remote-debugging/remote-debugging" rel="nofollow">Remote debugging Android and iOS</a></p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
