<p>I have been using <a href="http://rammichael.com/7-taskbar-tweaker" rel="nofollow">7+ Taskbar Tweaker</a> for a day and I'm blown away with two features. Mainly because windows alt+tab is not memorising order of open windows in it. There are two commands that I use constantly. 101 - Switch to the window which is located on the left to the active window on the taskbar and Switch to the window which is located on the right to the active window on the taskbar. </p>  <p>So when I do some programming and have to switch between windows fast, I just assign shortcuts for those 2 operations. It's making switching between windows so easy. One key is moving focus left and other to do right.</p>  <p>Is it possible to do this in autohotkeys? It would be so awesome. Because actually I don't need whole program, only this feature. I saw some code for it on web but it's not working in win 7/64. Basically I need script that will assign hotkey for moving focus from active window on taskbar to one to the left or one to the right. Also when it run out of left/right windows it should circle back to starting window(like normal alt tab is doing.)</p>
