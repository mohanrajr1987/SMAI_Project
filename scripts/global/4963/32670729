<p>I'll be brief: How do I get the color that the user can specify on the windows platform? On windows 10 it's the color of the tiles when you open the start menu. <code>SystemColor</code> doesn't work, it just returns the color <code>153 180 209</code> (a light blue) for <code>SystemColor.activeCaption</code> no matter what the setting is set to on every version of windows. <code>UIManager</code> is practically useless. The names of the keys seem to be different on every version of windows. It seems that <code>SystemColor</code> works on Mac and Linux. Any ideas as to how I get this color? Thanks.</p>
