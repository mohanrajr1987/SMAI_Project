<p>Let's say I have this layout in vim:</p>  <pre><code>+-----+-----+-----+ |     |     |     | |  a  |     |     | |     |     |     | +-----+  c  |  d  | |     |     |     | |  b  |     |     | |     |     |     | +-----+-----+-----+ </code></pre>  <p>is it possible to end up with this layout:</p>  <pre><code>+-----+-----+-----+ |     |     |     | |  a  |  c  |     | |     |     |     | +-----+-----+  d  | |           |     | |     b     |     | |           |     | +-----+-----+-----+ </code></pre>  <p>like an "extend right" command ?</p>  <p>PS. Don't tell me to use <code>ctrl-w J</code> on <em>b</em> then <code>ctrl-w L</code> on <em>d</em>, my layout is actually more complex then this. I'm really looking for an "extend right" command if it exists.</p>
