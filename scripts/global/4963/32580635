<p>My JavaFX Application is installed correctly in Windows 8 (64 bit) but refuses to run !</p>  <p>I use the JavaFX native packager to produce native install bundles for Windows (from an Eclipse / Ant script).</p>  <p>I create my Windows bundle from a 64-bit Windows 7 build machine - JDK used : 8u66 b02 early access - 64-bit Windows.</p>  <p>Unfortunately there is no logs generated by Windows ! So it's difficult to know the cause of the crash.</p>  <p>For information this is the list of DLL installed :</p>  <p>MSVCP120.dll</p>  <p>MSVCR100.dll</p>  <p>MSVCR120.dll</p>  <p>My problem is similar to this issue (Java Bug system) : <a href="https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8131321" rel="nofollow">https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8131321</a></p>  <p>But this bug normally was fixed !</p>  <p>Any ideas ?</p>
