<p>I created a window service using NSSM, when I start it, it works once and displays warning:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Could not resume ListenerNodeJS Service on Local Computer. Service did   not return an error. This could be an internal Windows error or an   internal service error.  If the problem persists, contact your system   administrator.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Service goes into pause state.</p>  <p>So I setup the service to automatically restart so it may work again every 2 minutes. Is it OK to make Window Service work like this?</p>
