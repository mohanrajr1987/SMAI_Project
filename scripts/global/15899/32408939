<p>I have a split pane which sits inside a dockmanager and it instructs the manager to let it be floating. from XAML i do this by</p>  <pre><code>&lt;Custom:XamDockManager&gt;     &lt;igDock:XamDockManager.Panes&gt;         &lt;igDock:SplitPane igDock:XamDockManager.InitialLocation="FloatingOnly"&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Now i have a requirement to do this dynamically construct the split pane from code. Question is, given an object, how do i set one of its dependency property at run time? The code sample given is using an infragistics dock manger control, but i think the concept will be generic wpf.</p>  <p>I tried the <code>dependencyObjectType.GetFields()</code> but did not find the dockmanager in the list for the split pane object.</p>  <p>From the code i am trying to </p>  <pre><code>SplitPane childPane = new SplitPane(); xamDockManager.Panes.Add(childPane); </code></pre>  <p>I am looking for something like <em>childPane.getDependency("xamDockManager").InitialLocation = FloatingOnly</em></p>
