<p>I have a data grid in my view that binds to an observable collection in my view model.</p>  <p>When I do this:</p>  <pre><code>myObservableCollection[2] = myItem; </code></pre>  <p>The data grid refresh the items, and for example, if I have shorted the elements in the data grid, if <code>myItem</code> has updated a field that is affected by the short, is put in its new position.</p>  <p>However, I would like to scroll to the new position, so I am trying to use an attached behavior, that is works good when the event selection changed is fired, but I need to know what event is fired when I reasign <code>myItem</code>.</p>  <p>I have try to catch the events <code>AddingNewItem</code> and <code>SourceUpdated</code>, but neither of them is fired.</p>
