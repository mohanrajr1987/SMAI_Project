<p>I have some code as follows:</p>  <pre><code>[TemplatePart(Name = "okButton", Type = typeof(Button))] [TemplatePart(Name = "cancelButton", Type = typeof(Button))] public class ModalPopup : ContentControl, IModalPopup {      private Button _okButton;      private Button _cancelButton;       '      '     public override void OnApplyTemplate()     {         base.OnApplyTemplate();          LoadTemplateParts();     }      private void LoadTemplateParts()     {         _okButton = GetTemplateChild("okButton") as Button;         _cancelButton = GetTemplateChild("cancelButton") as Button;     }  } </code></pre>  <p>There are many other template parts defined, though I'm only showing 2, and they all work fine. However if I try to add a new part (i.e. I want to add an Apply Button) the GetTemplateChild method only ever returns null for this new part. It's as though there is a cached definition for these template parts and I need to clean it somehow!</p>  <p>Does anyone have any suggestions?</p>
