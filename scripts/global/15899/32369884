<p>I want to create a WPF nested data grid which will have a fixed header and sub header. Below are some points which are required to create the nested grid control:-</p>  <ol> <li>The Main grid rows will have data aligned to the Main header columns and the nested grid rows will have data aligned to the sub-header columns.</li> <li>On click of Main grid row, the nested grid rows should get displayed with data corresponding to sub header columns.</li> <li>User must be able to expand multiple Main grid rows. </li> </ol>  <p>Below is an image which depicts the grid which we require.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ISTnu.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ISTnu.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>As shown in the above grid, the grey rows are the main rows aligned to the Main header and the two white rows are the sub rows aligned to the Sub header(operacao, autent., hora etc.)</p>  <p>The collection(Main grid) which has to be bound to this control has another collection as property which contains the rows of the Sub rows(Nested grid).</p>
