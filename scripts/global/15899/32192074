<p>I have VirtualizingStackPanel.VirtualizationMode="<strong>Standard</strong>" set for my ItemsControl (I don't want/cannot use Recycling now). There is vertical space to render around 10 items.</p>  <p>With this setting as I scroll (items go out of view and new items are getting added), I track the number of times <strong>ClearContainerForItemOverride</strong> gets called and I see that it doesn't get called for a lot of the items that go out of view! The VSP is definitely discarding items (as it creates a new item instead of recycling as expected), but is not calling ClearContainerForItemOverride for all such discarded items?! This causes a lot of problems because I don't get a chance to clean up properly.</p>  <p>So, is there a way to ensure that ClearContainerForItemOverride gets called consistently for all discarded items?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
