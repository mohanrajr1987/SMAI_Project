<p>I want to design a WPF usercontrol that has a shared property for all its instances with a common parent. That property is a shared "Maximum" value between multiple progressbar-alike controls.</p>  <p>Basically I am looking for the same principle that also makes radio buttons know each other within the same radio button group so they de-select themselves when a different option is selected.</p>  <p>How do I properly implement the user control to make it aware of other instances within the same group? And how do I find the common parent for a group, since they might not share the same direct parent element (e. g. when each progressbar is in its own item template of an items host)?</p>
