<p>I need something that arranges/sorts items like a wrappanel but allows you to rearrange the items via drag &amp; drop. I'm trying to prototype this out as quick as possible, so I'm just looking for something stupidly simple or hacky for now. I've been looking all over the place, but the only answers I could find required a relatively large amount of work to implement.</p>  <p>I would prefer not using an existing library if it's possible. </p>
