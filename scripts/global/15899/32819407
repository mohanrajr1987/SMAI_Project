<p>I am new to WPF with mostly Winforms and Webforms experience. I am trying to learn WPF and one thing that I am trying to learn is creating beautiful UI in XAML. I have been trying to replicate the UI of StaffLynx application. The screen shots are present here</p>  <p><a href="http://nextver.com/site/portfolio/stafflynx/" rel="nofollow">http://nextver.com/site/portfolio/stafflynx/</a></p>  <p>I cannot figure out in WPF, what will be the best way to create the placeholder container for the windows. In the link above you can see all the pages (views) are loaded in a custom shaped window. How can I create a re-usable window like this? </p>  <p>Should I just override the template of some control? In short I am not sure what is the right way to create a custom shaped window such as the one used by StaffLynx app.</p>  <p>Please advise.</p>
