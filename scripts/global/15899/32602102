<p>As I was required to sort of mask input in a textbox, I decided to construct my own control to handle this.</p>  <p>One of many templates could be "Size {enter size} Colour {enter colour}" which I've broken down to create a series of controls. The custom control that extends <code>StackPanel</code> which I've named <code>CustomTextBox</code> generates the following from the constructor.</p>  <pre><code>// Pseudo Children = {     Label = { Content = "Size" },     TextBox = { Text = "enter size" },     Label = { Content = "Colour" },     TextBox = { Text = "enter colour" }     // .. and an arbitrary amount of more Labels and TextBoxes in no particular order } </code></pre>  <p>So far so good. But when I want it to render.. That's where my headache starts. I've tried to add the controls to the <code>Children</code> property and <code>Measure/Arrange</code> on the parent, itself and all the <code>Children</code>. <code>ActualHeight</code> and <code>ActualWidth</code> do change to something other than <code>0</code>, but they won't render/display/become visible whatsoever.</p>  <p>I've also tried to use an <code>ItemsControl</code> and add the controls to the <code>ItemsSource</code> property to no avail.</p>  <p>I've tried to predefine sizes on everything, colour the background red and all, but the elusive controls remain to be caught and tied to my screen.</p>  <p>There's got to be a huge "Oooh..." here that I just can't find. I refuse to believe that this can't be done. I mean, it's WPF. WPF is awesome.</p>  <p><strong>Edit</strong> Updated to what I currently have that seems most likely to work - still doesn't though.</p>  <p>Whatever I do in the designer shows up, but nothing I do in the <code>CustomTextBox</code> makes any visible difference.</p>  <p><strong>Edit</strong> New headline that fits the problem better.</p>  <p>Also, I've found several examples of programmatically adding controls. Take <a href="http://arcanecode.com/2007/09/07/adding-wpf-controls-progrrammatically/" rel="nofollow" title="Adding WPF Controls Programmatically">this article</a> for example. I fail to see the difference between my scenario and theirs, except that theirs work and the buttons are visible.</p>
