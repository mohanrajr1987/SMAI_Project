<p>As a part of a Windows application (that I had to take over) I have the following line in a XAML file:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;Image Grid.Row="1" Grid.Column="5"    x:Name="PART_batterySymbol"   Stretch="Fill"    Source="/CustomControls;component/Resources/Symbol_Battery_2_50x50.png"/&gt; </code></pre>  <p>It shows a battery icon in a ListBox row:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/JRT6U.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/JRT6U.png" alt="screenshot"></a></p>  <p>Is it please possible to have a source code <em>inside of XAML</em> which would randomly select between the 3 images I have?</p>  <ul> <li>Symbol_Battery_1_50x50.png</li> <li>Symbol_Battery_2_50x50.png</li> <li>Symbol_Battery_3_50x50.png</li> </ul>  <p>I am a newbie in WPF and C#, but I had some developing experience with Adobe/Apache Flex and there it was possible to embed some code <em>inside of MXML</em> files by using <code>{ .... }</code> brackets</p>
