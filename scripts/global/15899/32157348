<p>In this screenshot from the Spotify app on my phone, you can see that they did something that looks like a partial border on the bottom left and right sides. I can't find any specific property to emulate that, so can someone explain to me how they did it?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Y2RMj.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Y2RMj.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I've tried playing with border radius, but unless I'm doing something wrong, I don't think it's that simple. Do they just have a custom shape underneath it or something?</p>
