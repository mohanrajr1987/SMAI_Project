<p>Let's assume you have a Border element...</p>  <pre><code>&lt;Border BorderBrush="Red" BorderThickness="1"&gt;   .... &lt;/Border&gt; </code></pre>  <p>... and we set the border width to 1 pixel. As long as the scaling in Windows is set to 100% 1 logical pixel is 1 physical pixel.</p>  <p>But when the zoom factor is set to 150% a get 1.5 physical pixels which results in blur. How can I make sure that the border width always matches full physical pixels.</p>  <p>What I want is from 100% to 199% I want 1 physical pixel. From 200% to 299% I want 2 physical pixels, ....</p>  <p>I thought about a IValueConverter that takes the logical pixels and converts them using the current scaling factor set up in windows to a value that matches full physical pixels. But I don't know how to do that.</p>
