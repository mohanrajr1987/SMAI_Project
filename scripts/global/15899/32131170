<p>I have a style in it's control template i have two borders. Part_Border and Part_Border1, Part_Border is default. And this style is located in a assembly called "Themes.dll".</p>  <p>I have two products Product-A and Product-B. When Product-B calls the Themes.dll then we have to use "Part_Border1" where as if Product-A calls Themes.dll then Part_Border(which is default) should apply.</p>  <p>How can we do this in WPF? please share your ideas. </p>
