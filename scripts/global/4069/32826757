<p>I'd like to unit test a Java EE <code>Message Driven Bean</code>'s <code>onMessage()</code> method. It receives a JMS message and does reading and some processing of the message content.</p>  <p>I'd like to stub the JMS message, but both ways known to me are not optimal:</p>  <ul> <li>Using a mocking framework (e.g. Mockito), I have to stub quite some method calls, which results in unreadable tests.</li> <li>Implementing the <code>javax.jms.Message</code> inteface for a manual stub message means I need to implement like "a hundred" methods, most of which I don't need. That looks ugly to me...</li> </ul>  <p>Is there a better way that I could use? I've heard that Spring has a good JMS Facade, but I'm not using Spring.</p>
