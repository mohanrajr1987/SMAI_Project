<p>I've learned a respectable amount about networking protocols in Grad School and in professional experience and sent HTTP requests programmatically using AJAX and such.</p>  <p>The project on which I work professionally uses JMS to communicate and I'm curious about how it works.</p>  <p>When using REST (for instance) one makes an HTTP request with parameters in either the URI or the message header in order to invoke a service and further describe its needs.</p>  <p>A mentor of mine at work and I were discussing how JMS works and I'm struggling to understand at an application level how messages are actually sent. As far as I understand JMS in general (I realize there are many implementations of JMS) it is a specification for how to format data being sent.</p>  <p>Is the message itself still sent via HTTP(S)? Could it be SMTP?</p>  <p>Without going <strong>excruciatingly</strong> deep I would like to understand how one would, at a code level, send a JMS message from one service to another?</p>  <p>Am I even thinking about this correctly? Can it be done any number of different ways? Is there a convention that's used in the industry?</p>  <p>If someone could shed some light on JMS for me I would appreciate it.</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
