<p>We developed an Java application in which multiple Java JMS clients connect to a server, both with Websphere MQ 7.0.1.9. Each client has consumer with selector on application specific client id eg. JMSCorrelationID='050_14133431' on shared queues, in which server set application specific client id on messages by setJMSCorrelationID( ) sent to a particular client. Application specifi client ids are unique. It works fine most of the time. However, we just found some messages with client A sessionId are consumed by client B surprisingly. I checked the logs and confirmed that each client only create consumer with selector on its sessionId. In my understanding, consumer with only consume messages that match the selector criteria. One thing to note is that I used read ahead feature as our application use non persistent messages. This happened very rarely, say once a month. Any idea why this happen? Any syntax error in JMSCorrelationID='050_14133431', should it must start with letter instead of digit? Any hints are appreciated. Thanks in advance.</p>
