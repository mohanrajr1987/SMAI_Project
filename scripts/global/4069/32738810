<p>When creating a JMS connection factory in Weblogic I don't see any option to specify which JMS server it is pointing to. Does it mean that in Weblogic a connection factory can access only local (or cluster-local) JMS server? And unless defining a foreign JMS server, a given servlet or EJB cannot access a JMS server running in another managed server in a domain (unless it is in the same cluster as a servlet/EJB)? </p>  <p>Also even for local JMS servers, what about when there are multiple JMS servers on a managed server, how to distinguish them?</p>
