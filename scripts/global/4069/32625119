<p>I am using Java EE JMS Queue. I am sending objects into the queue and then receive them with a MDB. When reading the message body (with getBody()) into an object I get the following exception:</p>  <pre><code>javax.jms.MessageFormatException: Body not assignable to class ... </code></pre>  <p>The object is quite big so it's hard to spot where the actual problem could be. It comes from a REST endpoint. Is there any way to get a more descriptive error out of this that would tell why exactly it is not assignable? I also tried to go into debug mode and see what kind of Message object arrives into the MDB but it is serialized as far as I can see so it's not really useful.</p>
