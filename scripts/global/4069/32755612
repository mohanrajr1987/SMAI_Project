<p>I discovered that JMS messages are not delivered in order. This is a great issue for my application.</p>  <p>Searching on the net I've found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2252085/how-to-handle-order-of-messages-in-jms">this thread</a> and the <a href="http://camel.apache.org/resequencer.html" rel="nofollow">Resequencer class</a> coming from Camel library.</p>  <p>Does anybody know how to use it inside a MDB (Message Driver Bean) hosted by a WebLogic application?</p>  <p>Thank you very much!</p>
