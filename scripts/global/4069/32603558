<p>I am trying to do unit testign on my method which is also a @JmsListener</p>  <pre><code> @JmsListener(destination = "queue") public void processMessage(String content){    //doSomething(); } </code></pre>  <p>But the problem is : to run my test I need to start my application and load my context etc ... (Spring boot application). But once my application run I connect to the queue and start processing real message.</p>  <p>In my unit test how can I avoid reading real message ?</p>  <p>thanks for your help </p>
