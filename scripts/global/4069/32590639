<p>We are using Websphere MQ8 and thinking about using durable Topics to implement a Publish and Subscribe pattern.</p>  <p>We are using Queues already and Hermes JMS-Browser to correct erroneous Queue-Messages.</p>  <p>I know that you can use Hermes to subscribe to topics but i think you cannot access and modify messages that are already on hold for a specific client.</p>  <p>So I would like to know - how do you handle problems when there are durable messages for a specific client application that the client can't consume, e.g. because the message has wrong format?</p>  <p>Do you have to delete alle undelivered messages for this client? Or is there some tooling that can do this?</p>
