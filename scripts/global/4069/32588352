<p>I am using Spring(boot) on my project and I access a JMS Queue (ActiveMQ) using :</p>  <pre><code>@JmsListener(destination = "mydestinationQueue") public void processMessage(String content) {     //do something } </code></pre>  <p>And it works perfectly but I need to be able to stop/pause/start this bean programatically (a REST call or something like that)</p>  <p>When I stop or pause this bean I want to be sure to have fully processed the current message.</p>  <p>any idea about that ?</p>  <p>thanks  </p>
