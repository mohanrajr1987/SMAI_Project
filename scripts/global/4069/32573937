<p>I have a javax.jms.Queue queue and have my listener listening to this queue. I get the message(a String) and execute a process passing the string as an input parameter to that process.</p>  <p>I want to just run 10 instances of that process running at one time. Once those are finished then only next messages should be processed.</p>  <p>How it can be achieved? As it reads all the message at once and runs as many instances of that process running, causing the server to be hanged.</p>  <pre><code>// using javax.jms.MessageListener message = consumer.receive(5000);  if (message != null) {      try {          handler.onMessage(message);  //handler is MessageListener instance     } } </code></pre>
