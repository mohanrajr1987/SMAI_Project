<p>I know this sounds as heard 1000 times, but I don't think so  and I could not really find a solution:</p>  <p>With common ejb I can use acknowledge mode to acknowledge()  message manually. If I don't do it is redelivered. I did this  in the past and it worked well. </p>  <p>Using Spring JMS I have the problem that it seems I either  can set redelivery to be processed only if an exception is  thrown or not at all. </p>  <p>How to realize it as with ejb?</p>  <p>My problem is: If the message is acknowledged I DON'T want  it to be redelivered at all, even if an exception occurs.</p>
