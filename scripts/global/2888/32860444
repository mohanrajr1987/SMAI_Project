<p>I have a UDP packet which is embedded inside IP packet and not able to calculate the checksum of UDP properly but I can correctly find the CHecksum of IP. Can someone help how the UDP checksum is found.</p>  <p>[45 00 00 53 00 80 00 00 40 11 <strong>66 16</strong> 0A 00 00 03 0A 00 00 02] CA B1 CA B1 00 3F DF A5</p>  <p>The bits enclosed in bracket is IP packet and the checksum is given in bold.</p>  <pre><code>**UDP Packet** CA B1 Source port CA B1 Destination port 00 3F Length DF A5 Checksum </code></pre>  <p>Here how the checksum "DF A5" came. I did 16 bit addition and took the 1s complement but still not getting the value. Whether I need to consider IP header also to calculate the Checksum of UDP</p>
