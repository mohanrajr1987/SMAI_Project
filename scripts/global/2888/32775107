<p>I have an elasticache instance and an EC2 instance, they are in different VPCs and as far as I can tell I can't change that (ECS and Elasticache creation won't let me put on in the other's VPC). I have set up an Active peer connection between the two VPCs, and in the elasticache instance's security group, I added a custom TCP rule from any source at port 6379 (it's a redis elasticache instance). </p>  <p>I have configured my route tables for both groups according to the AWS documentation.</p>  <p>I still have no idea what I'm missing. Whether it's by a module made for connecting to redis (node-redis, to be specific) or the <code>redis-cli</code> command after sshing into the EC2 instance, I don't seem to be able to connect and keep receiving a Connection Timed Out error. </p>  <p>Halp.</p>
