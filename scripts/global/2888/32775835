<p>I am using smack for building a chat app in Android. I am using a sticky_service to hold the connection. I have a confusion that if my app goes  to sleep what happens to TCP connection. I have read few answers on the page - <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13534732/how-to-make-the-android-device-hold-a-tcp-connection-to-internet-without-wake-lo">How to make the Android device hold a TCP connection to Internet without wake lock?</a></p>  <p>It wakes up for a brief period of time - For smack I can think of it as the processmessage listener (<a href="http://www.programcreek.com/java-api-examples/index.php?api=org.jivesoftware.smack.MessageListener" rel="nofollow">http://www.programcreek.com/java-api-examples/index.php?api=org.jivesoftware.smack.MessageListener</a>) is called. I am inserting data in db for that. Is there any guarantee that work will be complete or if the execution is left in between will it be started from there.</p>
