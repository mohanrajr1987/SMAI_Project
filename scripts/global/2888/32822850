<p>Can I use django to handle <strong>non</strong> http-requests and responses? I have a django web application serving up webpages, and I would like to use it to also communicate with other devices (hand-held gps sending in status reports and receiving ack) over tcp, but django reports that the requests are "</p>  <pre><code>code 400, message Bad HTTP/0.9 request type".      [28/Sep/2015 15:14:26] code 400, message Bad HTTP/0.9 request type ('[V1.0.0,244565434376396,1,abcd,2015-09-28')     [28/Sep/2015 15:14:26] "[V1.0.0,244565434376396,1,abcd,2015-09-28 14:14:12,1-2,865456543459367,2,T1]" 400 - </code></pre>  <p>The message from the device is sent as text over tcp with no http parameters at all.</p>  <p>I haven't found any information on how to do this with django, but it would make my life easier if it was possible.</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
