<p>Basically what i need to do is to get a notification, then proceed to receive the data using the class DataInputStream and the method read().</p>  <p>The problem is that the DataInputStream does not have a method to check if there is something to read and by doing tests with read() method would interfere with further calls to read().</p>  <p>I can do a hack to make the test by reading one byte and the append further data to it, but i would like to see if there is a more elegant solution.</p>
