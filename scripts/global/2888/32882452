<p>I'm using the ESP8266 wifi module to send/receive packets on the web from my microcontroller. In particular I've been using the </p>  <p><code>AT+CIPSTART="TCP",'xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx,80\r\n</code></p>  <p>command to pick which endpoint I'm sending packets to. It currently works with static IPs (or domains with static IPs); but I have yet to find a resource saying how this could work with virtual IPs (or domains with virtual IPs).</p>  <p>I have websites hosted on shared servers, but every-time I execute this CIPSTART command (with IP or domain), the response is of the generic shared server IP address page.</p>  <p><b>How can I get my ESP8266 to connect with my specific site that is hosted on a shared server with a virtual address?</b></p>  <p>Resources I've read:</p>  <ul> <li><a href="http://www.pridopia.co.uk/pi-doc/ESP8266ATCommandsSet.pdf" rel="nofollow">ESP8266 AT Command Set</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.pridopia.co.uk/pi-doc/ESP8266-AT-Examples.pdf" rel="nofollow">ESP8266 AT Command Examples</a></li> </ul>
