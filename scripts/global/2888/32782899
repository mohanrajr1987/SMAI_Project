<p>I make a connection to other operating system and send the data using fprintf and recieve using fscanf. Below is code that is implemented in matlab- It is running perfectly fine but while receiving it is very slow. It wait for around 6-10 sec and then receive the data. How can I make it fast. My data is not big.</p>  <pre><code>t2 = tcpip('192.168.56.101', 8001, 'NetworkRole', 'client');  set(t2, 'InputBufferSize', 30000);  fopen(t2);  fprintf(t2,'%5.4f,%5.4f,%5.4f,%5.4f',B(:));                          pause(0.1);                         while (get(t2, 'BytesAvailable') &gt; 0)                          DataReceived = fscanf(t2,'%c')                         end  fclose(t2);                delete(t2);                clear t2; </code></pre>  <p>Can you help me out how to make it fast as my data is not big.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
