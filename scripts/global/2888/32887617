<p>we have red hat linux ( 2.6.32-573.1.1.el6.x86_64) box on which tomcat 7.0.42 as application server. we have deployed the java application thats sends data to windows service through TCP. After fresh restart of tomcat its works fine but later it stop sending data to windows service port. Each time we restart tomcat it works fine for some time. when windows service tries to read data from java application using tcp socket it reads 0 bytes .[![enter image description here][1]][1] </p>
