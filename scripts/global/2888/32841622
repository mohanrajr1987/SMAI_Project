<p>I have a C++ app that connects to a nodeJS server through a TCP socket. On socket 'handshake' the client authenticates itself with a UUID known by the server, the server then associates the account to this recognised UUID</p>  <p>Once a TCP socket is open, the app sends requests and the server answers through the same socket.</p>  <p>Is it necessary to add passphrase to every request to be sure the request comes from the client? Or is a socket supposed to be in place and remain in place?</p>  <p>So should I be sure the client is the client:</p>  <ul> <li>Only when opening the socket?</li> <li>Every time a request is made?</li> </ul>
