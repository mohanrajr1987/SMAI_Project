<p>We have a set of WCF Services running on various Windows 2008 servers. Response sizes of these services varies around 300 Kb to 450 Kb.</p>  <p>We wanted to tune the TCP parameters to improve our network performance on these servers.</p>  <p>Referred few articles for TCP window size auto tuning : <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2007.01.cableguy.aspx" rel="nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2007.01.cableguy.aspx</a></p>  <p>I monitored the TCP communication for these WCF services with wireshark. Below are some stats on TCP parameters.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/g7FVI.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/g7FVI.jpg" alt="Wireshark TCP trace"></a></p>  <p>216 packets of 1460 size flown = 315360 bytes (315.36 kilobytes)</p>  <p>I also tried disabling enabling TCP window size Auto scaling and expected Window Size should be increase but it did not. cmd : netsh interface tcp show global</p>  <ol> <li>What should be the ideal window size for avg response size of 350 kb</li> <li>How to configure this windows size in Windows server 2008 R2 tried : <a href="http://kb.globalscape.com/KnowledgebaseArticle10438.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://kb.globalscape.com/KnowledgebaseArticle10438.aspx</a> but it does not mention the registry keys for Window Size.</li> </ol>  <p>Any other way to tune TCP stack to gain on network performance.</p>
