<p>On the official Microsoft's website there is a tutorial which describes how to create tcp client on Windows 8 phone apps:</p>  <p><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh202858%28v=vs.105%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh202858%28v=vs.105%29.aspx</a></p>  <p>I tested this code and it works correctly - I can connect to server, send and receive message. But...for some reason Microsoft decided to provide an example with WaitOne function which:</p>  <p>"Wait until the call is complete: In this example, the WaitOnemethod causes the UI thread to block until the Completed event fires or the call times out."</p>  <p>And this is a huge drawback for this example. If connection time out is set for example to 5000ms, the UI thread will be unusable for that time. So user will not be able to do anything on his phone... What for?  What should I do to not block the UI thread?  Is it possible not to block UI thread when I use WaitOne method ?</p>
