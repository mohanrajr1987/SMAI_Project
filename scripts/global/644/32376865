<p>I have been told that using ampersands in angular templates is bad practice since '&amp;' is reserved in HTML, but I see it in examples for angular all the time.</p>  <p>To be clear, would it be safe to write</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div ng-show="bool1 &amp;&amp; bool2"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>in an angular template?</p>  <p>I'm not interested in knowing if it works (it does), but if there are any edge cases where this could cause problems or if it's in fact discouraged.</p>
