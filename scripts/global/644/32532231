<p>I am using browser-sync to develop ui for a site, and the browser-sync snippet is being injected into an iframe on the page, which references a xhtml file from an epub 3.0. This produces an error because you can't use document.write() on xhtml which is how browser-sync injects it's script into the page.</p>  <p>I've tried using </p>  <pre><code>var sync = require('browser-sync');  sync({     server: {         baseDir: [             '.',             'bower_components' //- Because i'm making a polymer element, so when bower installed, ../path leads into bower_components         ]     },     snippetOptions: { //- I've tried each of the following by themselves also         blacklist: ['path/to/iframe/file.xhtml'],          whitelist: ['index.html'],         ignorePaths: ['path/to/iframe/file.xhtml']     } }); </code></pre>  <p>But it still injects the snippet into the iframe</p>  <p>I've also tried using browser-sync not in snippet mode (not setting proxy or server in config), but it doesn't reload the page on index.html when I manually place the snippet script into it.</p>  <pre><code>sync({     serveStatic: ['.', 'bower_components'] }); </code></pre>  <p>With the following at the end of index.html, the only file I want browser-sync to inject.     //http://HOST:3000/browser-sync/browser-sync-client.2.9.3.js'>&lt;/script>".replace("HOST", location.hostname));//]]></p>  <p>I made sure HOST:PORT matched the port that browser-sync was using</p>  <p>following the documentation from here <a href="http://www.browsersync.io/docs/options/#option-server" rel="nofollow">http://www.browsersync.io/docs/options/#option-server</a></p>
