<p>i am working on a cgi program , i am receiving an email address like this : someone@site.com and storing it in a file.  but some thing strange happens. when i use IE the '@' char , won't change and it is same in the file , but when i use chrome , '@' char ,changes to %40 and the only way to retrieve the '@' is to find %40 and replace it with '@'.am i coding wrong or chrome has problem?</p>  <p>to understand better :  IE: someone@site.com Chrome:someone%40site.com</p>  <p>and when i send information back to the browser ,  %40 doesn't change to @</p>
