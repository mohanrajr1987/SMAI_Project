<p>tl;dr: How do you include a file in the DOCTYPE declaration of an XHTML file? The solution from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/6509103/1016716">this answer</a> doesn't work, giving different types of errors in the different browsers.</p>  <hr>  <p>Longer version:<br> I am interested in defining character entities for XHTML files. One disadvantage of XHTML5 is that you can't use entity references such as <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> and <code>&amp;eacute;</code>, only the five basic XML ones.</p>  <p>Reverting to the XHTML 1 DOCTYPE would work (since the XHTML DTD contains definitions for all the entities) but then the validator complains about all the new XHTML5 features in the file.</p>  <p>Reverting the file type to <code>text/html</code> would also work, but then it wouldn't be XHTML any more! (Defining new entities doesn't work in HTML, only in XHTML.)</p>  <p>So the solution is to actively add all the entity names to the DOCTYPE declaration.</p>  <pre class="lang-html prettyprint-override"><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html    [       &lt;!ENTITY nbsp   "&amp;#160;"&gt;       &lt;!ENTITY eacute "&amp;#233;"&gt;    ] &gt; </code></pre>  <p>This works great! But including hundreds of entities this way would not be very efficient. Doing it by way of an include file would be much better.<br> I found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/6509103/1016716">this answer</a> which seems to do exactly what I need...</p>  <pre class="lang-html prettyprint-override"><code>&lt;!ENTITY % xhtml-special SYSTEM "xhtml-special.ent"&gt; %xhtml-special; </code></pre>  <p>but it doesn't work. If I try that, I get errors: <code>PEReference: %xhtml-special; not found</code> in Chromium; <code>XML Parsing Error: undefined entity</code> in SeaMonkey.</p>  <p>So does anybody know how it <em>should</em> be done? With a working example?</p>
