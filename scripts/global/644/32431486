<p>I am new to JSF(using Richfaces). I want to know, on what basis the html code is generated from JSF XHTML code(runtime) and how the html component's id(Client id) is set.  And, if we reRender a component, its get updated. On this case, whether new id(HTML Component's) is generates or not.</p>  <p><strong>Edit 1</strong>: I had referenced <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28351976/when-and-how-is-clientid-generated-in-jsf">When and how is clientID generated in JSF?</a>. Here every component is designed in tree according to UIComponentbase class and UIComponent UIViewRoot. Html components are created with unique id.</p>  <p>My Doubt is, Whenever we perform a ajax request and update any component using  <strong><em>reRender</em></strong>, a new view/tree is created with unique id or old tree components are just refreshed. </p>  <p>My problem is </p>  <ol> <li>Duplicate Id is generated at auto generation id. </li> </ol>  <p>ex. </p>  <blockquote>   <p>duplicate id for a component chgtype:j_id128:tblpnlfootcol8</p> </blockquote>  <p>I have got various duplicate id exception(along with Illegal Arguement Exception) in various pages like the above. Most of my page is request scope only. Some pages like login, dynamicMenu(for menu bar) is session scope. In many pages, duplicate id exception is raised and my project's quality is degraded due to this exception. I had searched a lot for this error. Can't find any solution.</p>  <p>Please suggest me a solution to get rid from this. I am using JSF 1.2, Richfaces 3.3 with Tomcat 7.</p>
