<p>I am running my XHTML file through W3C validation and an error is coming up. However, I am unable to understand the error - it says, "No p element in scope but a p end tag seen". </p>  <p>Can some with fresh eyes see it?</p>  <p>Here is my code:</p>  <pre><code> &lt;div id="mainBody"&gt;              &lt;div id="text"&gt;                  &lt;p&gt;                      &lt;img src="images/billyGraham.png" alt="Billy Graham"&gt;                      &lt;blockquote&gt;                      Billy Graham:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;                      Is it not arrogance or narrow-mindedness to claim that there is only one way of salvation or that the way we follow is the right way? I think not. After all, do we fault a pilot for being narrow-minded when he follows the instrument panel [while] landing in a rainstorm? No, we want him to remain narrowly focused!                      &lt;/blockquote&gt;                  &lt;/p&gt;                 &lt;/div&gt;         &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>
