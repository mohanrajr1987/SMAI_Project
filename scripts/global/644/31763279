<p>I use this common modern doctype to signify HTML 5 and so does the new site I'm working on.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I don't do anything to the HTML tag ( it's just <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> so I found it strange when I started working on a new site and found they used:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="en-US"&gt; </code></pre>  <p>What exactly is this line doing.  The type of HTML being used has already been specified.</p>  <p>Can the <code>xmlns</code> and <code>lang</code> attributes be removed or are they performing some function?</p>  <p><strong>Research</strong></p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6104438/what-does-the-xmlns-attribute-do">xmlns - xml namespace</a></p>
