<p>I am using flying saucer to generate report in PDF. I am using xml that contains CJK and xsl style sheet for organize data as input to the flying saucer. Also add HanaMinB font to display Japanese character. Flying saucer works in two steps to generate xmlt to PDF. 1. xml to XHTML/HTML 2. XHTML/HTML to PDF.</p>  <p>Once I run the code, It generate XHTML that successfully render the Japanese character into the file that display on browser as expected. but the PDF shows blank space instead of this character. Can any body know how to resolve this issue? </p>  <p>Thanks</p>
