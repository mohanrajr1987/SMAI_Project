<p>my client has an application in jsp/ servlets. the aim to re-write the view part of it in terms of achieving browser compatibility. the approach suggested is to to refactor the jsps by organizing to jsp fragments and  use along with xhtmls. can anyone please help with your comments on this approach? The aim is to reuse the jsps as much as possible, but still rewrite to browser compatible code ( IE-11). I am having doubts as to whether this alone would help in achieving compatibility. Shouldn't we mainly fix the javascript/ csss wherever there is pbm?</p>
