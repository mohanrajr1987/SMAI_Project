<p>In firefox, the localized html pages have to use xhtml, because localized variables are brought in as:</p>  <pre><code>&amp;blah.sub.name; </code></pre>  <p>But an issue is, with frameworks like angular, we need to set attributes that don't have a value. Such as ngCsp:</p>  <p><a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngCsp" rel="nofollow">https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngCsp</a></p>  <pre><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt; &lt;html ng-app ng-csp&gt; ... ... &lt;/html&gt; </code></pre>  <p>However xhtml doesn't agree with this and it throws errors. During runtime we can set these attributes with no value no problem, with javascript. However is there a way to do this not on runtime?</p>
