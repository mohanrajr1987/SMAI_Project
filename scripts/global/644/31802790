<p>Can anyone please help with this? </p>  <p>Which type should I follow? Semantic tags or presentational?</p>  <p>The <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> (presentational) and <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> (semantic) give same result. </p>  <p>So which convention should I use and why? Is there any difference between them?</p>
