<p>I have a xhtml file with <code>&lt;ice:outputText value="#{exam.testName}"/&gt;</code></p>  <p>The part of the webpage associated with that statement just shows the Test Name. I have the whole java source code and I am trying to find the database query that brings back the test names.  I don't know what exam.testName means and what it refers to in the code for it to get the test name for that page.</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
