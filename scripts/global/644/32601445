<p>I have implemented the Jazzy spell-check API in my project to find misspelled words and provide suggestions for these words. I've downloaded a ".dic" file to be used with it. However, the dictionary file doesn't contain words in alphabetic order. Could anyone point out the reason why?</p>  <p>Also we have a <code>getSuggestions()</code> method, which provides the suggestions for the misspelled words. Could anyone suggest how to it determines which suggestion displays first?</p>
