<p>I have a string fetch from database having emoji's. If suppose someone try to put some incorrect emoji like <code>ud83d\ude00</code>. In this case the system cannot find the correct combination and then rest of the string is not displaced. If this kind of string is inserted I need to display as such. Can any one please help</p>  <p>Edit:- I convert the string into UTF-8 format and then it worked, Thanks for all your help.</p>
