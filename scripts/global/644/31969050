<p>I have developed a web application in which the user logins through third party authentication. In the web application, I have generated a some content in a xhtml page. Now I want this generated content embeded into another xhtml page as PDF. It might work with <code>embed tag</code> or <code>object tag</code> but I don't know how it will work. It works if I have a PDF file present in the application but I don;t have any. How I can solve it? Is there any way to do so?</p>
