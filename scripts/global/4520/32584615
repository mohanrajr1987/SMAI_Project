<p>I am creating a patch MSP "<a href="http://wixtoolset.org/documentation/manual/v3/patching/wix_patching.html" rel="nofollow">using Purely Wix</a>" approach.</p>  <p>There are 2 components whose filenames are same, e.g. "ABC.dll", one for x64 and the other for x86. They are installed under <strong>CommonFiles64Folder</strong> (<strong><em>C:\Program Files\Common Files\myCompany</em></strong>) and <strong>CommonFilesFolder</strong> (<strong><em>C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\myCompany</em></strong>).</p>  <p>As a preparation of patch creation, I run the administrative install (<strong><em>msiexec.exe -a new.msi -q TARGETDIR=d:\work</em></strong>)</p>  <p>I was expecting they would be extracted to "d:\work\Program Files\Common Files\myCompany" and "d:\work\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\myCompany".</p>  <p>Instead, both files are extracted to "<strong><em>d:\work\Common Files\myCompany</em></strong>" and one of them overwrites the other.</p>  <p>Is there any way to avoid my problem? Perhaps a commandline argument that I am unaware of???</p>
