<p>IÂ´m building an installer using WiX. My current problem is when the exe is downloaded Google Chrome displays</p>  <pre><code>"... exe may harm your browsing experience, so Chrome has blocked it." </code></pre>  <p>My bundle has some third party installation and my own app installer. My app has some code for implementing WinForms WebBrowser which most probably causes this chrome behavior(before including it in the app there was no such problem). How can i handle this?</p>
