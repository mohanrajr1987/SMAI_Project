<p>We include a number of ExePackage prerequisites with our Wix Burn managed bootstrapper application, including .NET and Sql Server.</p>  <p>Are we better off setting the download url to a Microsoft address, or copying the prerequisite installers to our own server and linking to them there?</p>  <p>How stable are the Microsoft urls? Can we rely on them to always be there?</p>  <p>If we copy the installers, are they likely to get "stale"?</p>
