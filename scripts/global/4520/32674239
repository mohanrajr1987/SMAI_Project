<p>I’m lamenting the lack of documentation for the Wix Burn bootstrapper engine. I’m hoping I can get a few specific questions answered.</p>  <p>I know that the Burn engine requires .Net 4.0. It seems to have its own mini-bootstrapper that will install .Net 4.0 if it’s not present.</p>  <p>(1)  .Net 4.5 is supposed to be an in-place replacement for .Net 4.0. Does the mini-bootstrapper recognize this and not install 4.0 if it sees 4.5 is present?</p>  <p>(2) My application and my custom bootstrapper require .Net 4.5. Can I tell the mini-bootstrapper to install 4.5 instead of 4.0?</p>  <p>This leads directly to questions about BootstrapperCore.config. </p>  <p>(3) How does the startup, supportedRuntime element tie into this? </p>  <p>(4) Where can I find the list of allowed values and the syntax for the version and sku attributes?</p>  <p>(5) If I want only 4.5, should I still include a supportedRuntime for 4.0?</p>  <p>(6) How does the host, supportedFramework element tie into this?</p>  <p>(7) If my custom bootstrapper requires 4.5, will it fail if I include a supportedFramework for 4.0, and 4.0 is present but 4.5 is not?</p>  <p>(8) If I require 4.5 and the target system already has 4.5.1 (or later), will Burn recognize this and skip installing 4.5?</p>  <p>Also, possibly non-related, what’s the difference between v4/Full and v4/Client?</p>
