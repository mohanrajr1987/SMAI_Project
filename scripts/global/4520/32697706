<p>I have a WiX installer which creates start menu shortcuts for the application and pdf documentation (and another with html documentation). However, I have noticed that Windows 10 does not find the pdf when I search for it in the start menu (it only finds the application). The shortcut is there and if I drill down into the start menu, I will find it - just can't search for it.</p>  <p>I don't think Windows 10 will find shortcuts to anything other than .exe, .bat and .chm. I can create a .bat file that will launch the pdf / html documents but this doesn't seem like the cleanest solution to me.</p>  <p>Does anyone have any other suggestions or opinions?</p>
