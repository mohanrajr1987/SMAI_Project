<p>I have the following within the Product Tag:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;Property Id="LICENSEKEY" Admin="yes" Hidden="no"&gt;   &lt;RegistrySearch Id="RememberLicenseKey" Root="HKLM" Key="SOFTWARE\MyApp\key1\Settings" Name="LICENSEKEY" Type="raw"&gt;&lt;/RegistrySearch&gt; &lt;/Property&gt;  &lt;Condition Message="License key is required to proceed"&gt;LICENSEKEY AND NOT Installed&lt;/Condition&gt; </code></pre>  <p>What I want to do is pass the License key as a command line argument to msiexec, and then set it in the registry. If the key is not passed I want to cancel the installation. Therefore, this check only needs to be run at install time. However, the condition that I have added causes a popup both at install and uninstall time. Can't seem to figure out what I am doing wrong. </p>  <p>EDIT: I tested with the following condition and it seems to show the message both on install and uninstall:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;Condition Message="License key is required to proceed"&gt;NOT Installed&lt;/Condition&gt; </code></pre>
