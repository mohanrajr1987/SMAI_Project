<p>I have a situation where I want to initialize APPDIR via a C# custom action, but I only want to do so if APPDIR wasn't supplied as a command line argument (there's custom logic which occurs in our bootstrapper which I want to use in setting the default path for the MSI as well, as we ship both).</p>  <p>I've tried looking through the tables but it doesn't appear as though the command line arguments are set there.</p>  <p>The logs output:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>MSI (c) (A0:78) [16:40:33:995]: Command Line: APPDIR=C:\WHAT CURRENTDIRECTORY=E:\ CLIENTUILEVEL=0 CLIENTPROCESSID=10912 </p> </blockquote>  <p>when I set <code>APPDIR=C:\WHAT</code> on the command line, but I cannot find a place to check whether a value was in fact <strong>set by command line</strong> (rather than by default value, UI or a custom action).</p>
