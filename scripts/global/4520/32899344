<p>I am trying to install <a href="https://www.meteor.com/" rel="nofollow">Meteor</a> on my Windows 7 PC using the Windows Installer. Every time I try, it downloads for a while and then a window opens saying that the "Setup Failed". The log file contains the following lines that I think are relevant. </p>  <blockquote>   <p>[121C:04D0][2015-10-02T09:38:56]e000: Error 0x80070643: Failed to install MSI package.   [121C:04D0][2015-10-02T09:38:56]e000: Error 0x80070643: Failed to configure per-user MSI package.   [121C:04D0][2015-10-02T09:38:56]i319: Applied execute package: SetupMeteor_UserInstall, result: 0x80070643, restart: None   [121C:04D0][2015-10-02T09:38:56]e000: Error 0x80070643: Failed to execute MSI package.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I believe that this problem is to do with my computer and not the installer, but I am unsure why these errors occur or what I should try in order to fix them.</p>
