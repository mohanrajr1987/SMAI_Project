<p>I've been wanting to modify the location of the <code>InstallDirDlgDescription</code> text (Click Next to install to the default folder or click Change to choose another.) The x co-ordinate of this text by default is X="25" and the text overlaps with my logo (I've customized the dialog to change the banner to my logo).</p>  <p>I know I can change the VALUE of the String by doing --> </p>  <pre><code>&lt;String Id="InstallDirDlgDescription"&gt;This is a custom message.&lt;/String&gt; </code></pre>  <p>But is there a way of changing the location of the text (I want to set X = "5" so that the text shifts to left and doesn't overlap with my logo) ?</p>  <p>Thanks !</p>
