<p>I am facing an issue with some installation using the Local System Account. </p>  <p>I stumbled upon the following post :  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10932927/is-it-possible-to-execute-a-custom-action-in-wix-that-is-a-managed-exe-file">Is it possible to execute a custom action in WiX that is a managed .EXE file?</a></p>  <p>The first comment explains my situation accurately - "One other thing to note is that deferred actions run under the context of the system account, so if the exe requires access to a profile for any reason, this will cause it to fail. I had this very issue when trying to generate a certificate as part of my install."</p>  <p>The solution that was suggested was to spawn PowerShell using -RunAs switch and run a script to call the exe.</p>  <p>I have no knowledge of PowerShell. So I need help coming up this script. </p>
