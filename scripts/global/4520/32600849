<p>I have built an MSI Installer using WIX. And I want to disable cancel button only when user is performing uninstall from Control panel or performing uninstall in basic mode (/qb). </p>  <p>Note:  In full mode (/qf) installer is disabling Cancel button.  We have only one custom dialog and all other dialogs like Welcome, EULA, InstallDir, etc... are from WixUIExtension.dll In following links I got some information regarding this:</p>  <p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/astebner/archive/2010/05/12/10011664.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/astebner/archive/2010/05/12/10011664.aspx</a></p>  <p><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa368791(v=vs.85).aspx" rel="nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa368791(v=vs.85).aspx</a></p>  <p>As per link 1 &amp; 2 by executing uninstall from command line using /qb! parameter will disable the cancel button. So, in this way it is possible to disable but user mostly do it from Control panel.  I also appended /qb! parameter under uninstall (HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall{Product Code}) in registry. But that also did not work for me. </p>  <p>Is their any WIX property which I can use to disable cancel button? Or what will be the correct way to handle this scenario?</p>
