<p>In my managed bootstrapper, I'm packing Net framework 4.5.1 and VC Redistributable as follows:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;PackageGroupRef Id         = "NetFx451Redist"  /&gt;          &lt;PackageGroupRef Id         = "VC_ReDist_120" After="NetFx451Redist"   /&gt;    &lt;RollbackBoundary /&gt;    &lt;MsiPackage      Id         = "MainProduct"                    DisplayName             = "$(var.ProductName)"                                           DisplayInternalUI       = "no"                    Visible                 = "no"                    Compressed              = "yes"                    SourceFile              = "$(var.MainProduct)"                    Vital                   = "yes"                    After                   = "NetFx451Redist"                                &gt; </code></pre>  <p>On Windows 7 x64, where Net FW 4.5.1 is not present, by installing, this would display wixstdba's basic screen to install .Net framework and it also adds an entry in Add-Remove programs, before finishing Net Framework and launching my msi package installation. <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/H4qkR.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/H4qkR.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p><strong>Problem</strong>: Now upon finishing Net Framework 4.5.1 installation and launching my product package(managed bootstrapper), if I cancel its installation, or it may get terminated due to any error/issue, it left the entry in Add-Remove programs. If I try to uninstall/change it from Add-Remove programs , it again launches the managed bootstrapper installation interface with Install button enabled, as if it is fresh installation, but always ending with errors.</p>  <p>I want to remove its entry from Add-Remove program if I cancel the installation or it is terminated due to any error/issue, from managed interface.</p>  <p>Am I missing something from my Bundle or Managed Code...???</p>
