<p>I have a WIX file (*.wxs) in which we are using %USERDOMAIN environment variable to retrieve the domain of the logged in user. For eg., it gives DOMAINA for a user logged in as DOMAINA\user1. This extracted domain name is then used to prefix other Security Groups that are used to ACL web resources.</p>  <p>It was working fine until now. But now, due to security restrictions, the logged in user is not from the same domain the server and applications run. The user is logged in from a Management domain, say DOMAINM. Now, %USERDOMAIN does not help as the resources are ACLed with incorrect SGs, like DOMAINM\SG1, etc, which don't exist.</p>  <p>What are my options to retrieve the domain of the server so that it can be used in the WIX file for generating MSI for deployment?</p>  <p>Thanks for your help!</p>
