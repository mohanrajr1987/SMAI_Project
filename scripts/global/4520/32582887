<p>My main application has several features as follows,</p>  <pre><code>Main App        |-&gt;Database feature (Requires SQLServer 2008)        |-&gt;Reports feature  (Requires Crystal Reports)        |-&gt;Other features </code></pre>  <p>I have successfully created a bootstrapper application which checks and installs(if not already installed) prerequisites(SQL &amp; Crystal Reports)  .However, I want the bootstrapper to install the prerequisites only if the respective feature which uses it has been selected (Install SQL Server only if database feature selected, same for crystal reports)</p>  <p>Since my bootstrapper application performs the checks first, installs the prerequisites and THEN launches the MSI for "Main App" I don't know how to check for the selected features.</p>  <p>Is there a way of installing 3rd party applications AFTER feature selection ?</p>  <p>IF NOT,</p>  <p>Is there a way of asking the user which 3rd applications to install? (Maybe checkboxes like </p>  <pre><code> o SQL Server 2008 (Required for Database)  o Crystal Reports (Required for Reports) </code></pre>  <p>and then install the packages which have been selected)</p>  <p>Thanks </p>
