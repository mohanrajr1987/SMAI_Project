<p>I'm currently trying to understand the relationship between Windows Installer ProductCode and the Version attribute.</p>  <p>As far as I understand the <a href="http://wixtoolset.org/documentation/manual/v3/howtos/updates/major_upgrade.html" rel="nofollow">examples</a> I've seen so far, the ProductCode denotes a specific version, so increasing the version also should change the product code. (Indeed the example above uses <code>Product Id='*'</code>).</p>  <p>To understand this better, I am asking myself whether there is <em>any</em> scenario that would keep the ProductCode the same but increase the <code>Version</code>? What would Windows Installer do with such an MSI, given a previous one with a different ProductCode (but same UpgradeCode) were installed?</p>  <p>I guess another variation on my confusing would be: If I onnly want to do "major upgrades" does <code>Id='*'</code> make sense or will I have to control the ProductCode somehow?</p>
