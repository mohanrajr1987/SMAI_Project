<p>Does anyone know of a custom wix MBA tutorial/sample that just goes through the minimum to get the MBA working? (as if it were the standard bootstrapper without the GUI?)</p>  <p>It's not that i want to bootstrap without user interface, i need a GUI. That's actually the reason why I need the custom bootstrapper: the standard one has a GUI that is not sufficiently customizable. What I want is to isolate the problem of customizing burn from the problem of making my GUI.</p>  <p>I have been here: <a href="http://bryanpjohnston.com/2012/09/28/custom-wix-managed-bootstrapper-application/" rel="nofollow">http://bryanpjohnston.com/2012/09/28/custom-wix-managed-bootstrapper-application/</a></p>  <p>and here: <a href="http://www.wrightfully.com/part-1-of-writing-your-own-net-based-installer-with-wix-overview/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wrightfully.com/part-1-of-writing-your-own-net-based-installer-with-wix-overview/</a></p>  <p>but unfortunately these and all other tutorials want me to learn WPF as well, as if learning wix customization is not difficult enough... Anyone knows of a tutorial that uses windows forms? Or even no GUI at all?</p>
