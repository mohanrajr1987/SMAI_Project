<p>Here's a brief background on what i'm trying to achieve,</p>  <p>Simple MVC web application with a .msi/exe installer.</p>  <p>The installer must do some initial checks prior to installing, for example check for IIS, static content compression and more.</p>  <p>Now to achieve this i have gone with the WiX Toolset due to the flexibility of the installer, now i've got to grips with most things with the WiX toolset, and got some of my custom actions done, but unfortunately i have one issue with one of my custom actions, now need some help regarding this.</p>  <p>Now i'm getting a generic 1603 code error, which i've found the real error code to be 2896, and i have narrowed it down to the method in my custom action which is the problem, "SetSelectedWebSiteDetils", now please see the source code behind in this pastebin link <a href="http://pastebin.com/T8BqAUS6" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>  <p>As you can see from the highlighted text in that paste, it's when i've set my selected website to deploy against in IIS, and then go to click next on the dialogue as seen below, it then end's.</p>  <p>Now i've tried few things like making sure my custom action matchs the method etc, making sure my useLegacyV2RuntimeActivationPolicy="true" but still no luck.</p>  <p>Any thoughts?</p>  <p>Thanks,</p>
