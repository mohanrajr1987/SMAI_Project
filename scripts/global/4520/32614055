<p>I am writing a custom bootstrapper application, that have to install 3 msiPackages(InstallScope is set to "perMachine" for all of them). But the BA doesn't install any of them. Here are the error messages from log file:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Error 0x800700e8: Failed to write message type to pipe. Error   0x800700e8: Failed to write send message to pipe. Error 0x800700e8:   Failed to send   BURN_ELEVATION_MESSAGE_TYPE_PROCESS_DEPENDENT_REGISTRATION message to   per-machine process. Error 0x800700e8: Failed to execute dependent   registration action. Error 0x800700e8: Failed to write message type to   pipe. Error 0x800700e8: Failed to write send message to pipe. Error   0x800700e8: Failed to send message to per-machine process. Error   0x800700e8: Failed to save engine state in per-machine process.</p> </blockquote>  <p>When I run the bundle installer as administrator, all packages are successfully installed. It seems that BA need to be elevated, for installing perMachine. As far as I know Engine.Apply() elevate the install process. And after call Engine.Apply(), appears UAC dialog. But msiPackages still could not be installed.</p>  <p>I experimented with the msiPacages configurations and got an interesting result. If one of the packages configured to perUser install, BA will work fine, and install all components without administrators privileges. But it is necessary to install all packages perMashine.</p>  <p>What may be wrong with my BA?</p>
