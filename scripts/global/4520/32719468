<p>An old Wix 2.0 Web project (.net 2.0, C#), needs to be brought up to date.</p>  <p>I just installed wix toolset 3.10. (I still have the wix 2.0 on this computer)</p>  <p>I have Visual Studio 2005 (8.0.50727.42 version 2.0.50727 SP2)</p>  <p><em>I also have Visual studio 2008 installed (9.0.30729.4462 QFE, version 3.5 sp1), in case 2005 is not going to be enough, but I thought I will just not update the whole solution just yet, if I don't need to.</em></p>  <p>All this on an XP Professional machine, version 2002, SP3</p>  <p>I am not able to see the WiX from either VS05 or VS08.</p>  <p>Can this work all together? Or I need to upgrade Visual Studio or the XP operating system? Or maybe I should use an earlier version of wix?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>  <p>I tried searching for an issue like this, but have not find anything yet, hope it is not a duplicate question.</p>
