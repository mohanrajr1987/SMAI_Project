<p>I am required to install firebird super server on windows as a service, as a part of my application installation through wix for windows machines.</p>  <p>The machines might have a another firebird instance, usually default instance running, thus must be installed on a different port. User should not see any dialogues and installation should happen in the background. </p>  <p>I am able to do the installation through instsvc, installing firebird on a different port with a new instance name. However on windows you get the file execution security warning for instsvc execution. Thus I was looking in to <a href="http://www.mwasoftware.co.uk/firebird-msm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mwasoftware.co.uk/firebird-msm</a> merge modules but, it does not provide me with information on how to install on a different port/service name(if required). </p>  <p>Could you please provide me info on how to install firebird using wix, so that it would install firebird as apart of my wix installation, on a specified port, without obstructing existing installations, and no interaction from the user.</p>
