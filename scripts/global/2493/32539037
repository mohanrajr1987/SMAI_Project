<p>is there a possible way to compare an input from user in java </p>  <p>with several attribute value in excel sheet? </p>  <p>I am trying to read 6 input from the user (Symptoms) and compare it with </p>  <p>each attribute values in my disease symptoms excel sheet.</p>  <p>disease symptoms is something like this:</p>  <pre><code>------------------------------------------------------------------------ disease_id | disease name | symptoms_1     | symptoms_2    | symptoms_3 |..      1      |  flu         |  fever         |  dry cough    | headache  |     2      |  diarrhea    |abdominal cramps| abdominal pain| fever     |  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </code></pre>  <p>first, the application will ask: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>do you experience any of these symptoms, then it shows all symptoms_1 </p> </blockquote>  <p>values in a drop-down list for user to select from it. then the it asks for the next symptoms same way.</p>  <p>ex: if I select fever from the first drop-down list(all values of  symptoms_1), in java I want to increase disease 1 and disease 2 by 20% and </p>  <p>then when I select dry cough in the second drop-down list(all values of  symptoms_2), so disease_1 will be 40%.</p>  <p>My question is this way is possible in java using excel as a database? </p>  <p>if not please give an idea to solve this problem.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
