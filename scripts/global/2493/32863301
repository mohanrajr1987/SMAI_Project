<p>i am trying to search for a word with grep in R and want to be able to do two things: </p>  <ol> <li>find the preceding and subsequent word</li> <li>find the preceding and subsequent line</li> </ol>  <p>I have been unable to figure out how to do this with R. In terminal, 2. can be done easily with <code>-A/-B/-C</code>. Can these expressions be used in R?</p>  <p>For example, if my target word is "suspendito" from [1594], I want to be able to provide both the lines in [1593] and [1595], as well as the words to the right and left of suspendito (here "in" and "oleo").</p>  <pre><code>[1593] Post dies omnino XII pernas eximito et salem omnem detergeto et suspendito in vento biduum                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          [1594] Die tertio extergeto spongea bene, perunguito oleo, suspendito in fumo biduum                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       [1595] Tertio die demito, perunguito oleo et aceto conmixto, suspendito in carnario </code></pre>
