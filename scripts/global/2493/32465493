<p>I have a site, which allows users to search listings. I have all of the associated data stored in a database and I plan to use Sphinx to index and retrieve this info.</p>  <p>I want to use a PHP Script to retrieve this information, and my understanding is SphinxQL is the most up to date way of doing this (instead of using Sphinx API).</p>  <p>So how do I first implement Sphinx QL on Ubuntu 14.04? I have tried to read the documentation from Sphinx however have had no luck.</p>  <p>How do I then use PHP in a .php script to query the sphinx index and echo this?</p>  <p>I have tried to find a simplified example online however I can only find examples using the API.</p>  <p>Thanks for the help</p>
