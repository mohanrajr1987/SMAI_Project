<p>I am working on a project where I have a database, that contains a summary field, which is filled in by a web form that visitors to the site enter on. </p>  <p>When the user completes entering the summary field, I want to perform a lookup using the words that were entered by the the user on the page for similar records in the database that contain the same keywords that they've filled in on the page. </p>  <p>I was thinking I could split the summary string that is submitted and then loop through the array and build up a query so the query would end up something like:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT *  FROM my_table  WHERE summary LIKE '%keyword1%'  OR summary LIKE '%keyword2'  OR summary LIKE '%keyword3%'; </code></pre>  <p>However, this seems massively inefficient, and as the database could grow quite big, could potentially become quite a slow query to run. </p>  <p>I then found the MySQL <code>IN</code> clause, but this only seems to work with multiple values where a field can only contain 1 of these values in a row. </p>  <p>Is there a way I can use the IN function, or is there a better MySQL function that I can use to do what I want or is my first idea the only way round it. </p>  <p>An example of what I am trying to achieve is a bit like on Stackoverflow. When you lose focus of the title field, it pops up similar questions based on the title you've provided. </p>  <p>Thanks for any help you can provide. </p>
