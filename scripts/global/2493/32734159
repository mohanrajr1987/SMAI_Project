<p>I was using</p>  <pre><code>... JOIN db1.col col1 ON col1.artists = maindata.artists ... </code></pre>  <p>Now as <code>artists</code> field is no longer shorter than 255 chars, I had to make it <code>TEXT</code>. The only way to index it is <code>FULLTEXT</code> as far as I see.</p>  <p>Therefore, I need something like the following:</p>  <pre><code>JOIN db1.col col1 ON MATCH(col1.artist) AGAINST (maindata.artists) </code></pre>  <p>How can I achieve this? I couldn't figure out the correct way to do it.</p>  <p>Actually this must be a perfect match, so I have to use <code>equal sign</code> but it will be very slow.</p>
