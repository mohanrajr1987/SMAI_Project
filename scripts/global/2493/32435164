<p>I have got a mad issue with a <code>sharepoint 2010</code> <code>full text query</code>.</p>  <p>I have created a <code>WebPart</code> which allows me to send a full text query to the <code>sharepoint 2010 server</code> and give me the results in a table.</p>  <p>Now I have an issue with a query.  If I write this query, it shows these <strong>results:</strong></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/HyItS.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/HyItS.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Minimum one entry is missing in the results. The mad thing is now, if I <strong>add another filter</strong> in the query, it shows me the <strong>missing entry:</strong></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/PGt8h.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/PGt8h.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <blockquote>   <p>1) How can by adding another filter the missing entry appear?!?  </p> </blockquote>  <p>For me it makes no sense. I used exactly the same filters in the statement before.  </p>  <blockquote>   <p>2) So how can it disappear in the first query?<br>   3) Is there something, I did not recognize / know about the full text query?   Has anybody a hint for me?  </p> </blockquote>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
