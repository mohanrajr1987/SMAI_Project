<p>I am running innodb 5.6.17. I have a data_blocks table with a column tags of type TEXT. I enabled full text indexing on it so that I can link multiple tag rows to this row. like this: </p>  <pre><code>tags [16][3] [18][3] </code></pre>  <p>the numbers are ids that point to tags in the the tags table. a data_block can have a combination of as many or as little tags that they want. I couldn't find a way to link this from a one to many relationship so I created a text column in this format. It works fairly well but it is very slow using</p>  <pre><code>WHERE tags LIKE "%[16]%"; </code></pre>  <p>I tried using full text search using </p>  <pre><code>SELECT * FROM data_blocks WHERE MATCH(tags) AGAINST("+[16]"); </code></pre>  <p>But this returned 0 results. I already decreased the ft_min_word_len to 3 so that event a one digit id will search but it still returns 0.</p>  <p>If I need to do this a completely different way please tell me, otherwise, why is the full text search not returning any rows?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
