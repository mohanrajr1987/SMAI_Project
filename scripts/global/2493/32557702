<p>I have to implement full text search in iPhone app. My scenario is i have HTML content in resource folder, &amp; reference available in SQLite DB. I have to give search facility so I decided to go with FTS. </p>  <p><strong>Now I have problem, install database in iPhone</strong></p>  <p>There are two ways I can achieve install database.</p>  <p>1> before copying  database into iPhone install location, set up FTS table &amp; data. i.e install database with complete set together</p>  <p>If I want to do like above way then I should create SQLite compiled database. Problem how to create compile database. <a href="http://firstbestanswer.com/question/17he8n/open-already-existing-database-fmdb-include.html" rel="nofollow">refer this link</a></p>  <p>2> First install normal database set, then programmatically create FTS database &amp; insert records into db. It's ok. Initial time/ first install time take more time</p>  <p>I tried like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q73zLz9FMWU" rel="nofollow">this</a> Could you please, anyone help me how to create s3db format database, </p>
