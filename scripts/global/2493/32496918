<p>I am currently running into some troubles with a query involving a MySQL fulltext index. Actually it is a <code>FULLTEXT</code> index consistent of 3 columns, 2 <code>VARCHAR(255)</code> and <code>TEXT</code>. I am using this index to query the table with <code>MATCH(..) AGAINST(..)</code>. </p>  <p>The table itself has approximately 1 million records (a bit less) stored.</p>  <p>Normal querying involving the index is actually really fast. However using <code>COUNT()</code> or <code>ORDER BY</code> (particularly important to order by score) the query itself runs at least for 1.2s.</p>  <p>Any ideas on how to improve the performance? I know that there are several specialized fulltext searching options beside MySQL, but for the moment i need to improve MySQL performance as far as i can.</p>
