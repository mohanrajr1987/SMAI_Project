<p>I'm implementing a simple search in postgresql that will be used to retrieve typeahead results on a web page.  So, I need the last argument to use starts-with matching, since the user may not have finished typing the word.  When I construct my <code>tsquery</code>, I'm adding <code>:*</code> to the last argument.  Here's a sample query:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT id, key, name FROM principal,      to_tsvector(key || ' ' || name) vector,      to_tsquery('investig:*') query WHERE vector @@ query ORDER BY ts_rank(vector, query) DESC </code></pre>  <p>While typing the word "investigate", I get the following behavior:</p>  <pre> Input       | Result Count ==========================        i           | 0 in          | 0 inv         | 8 inve        | 8 inves       | 8 invest      | 8 investi     | 7 investig    | 7 investiga   | 0 investigat  | 0 investigate | 7 </pre>  <p>This is better than if I omit the <code>:*</code>, but not good enough.  Why do I get 0 results for <code>investiga</code> when <code>investigate</code> returns 7 results?  Is there a better way to construct my query to make sure I get everything that begins with a search term?</p>
