<p>for a java project i am collecting tweets from twitter, i have collected about 30,000 tweets so far and going to collect more, i want to remove stopwords from those tweets and filter them to another mirror datatbase by removing the stopwords, can anyone help me with this, thanks. If i download some list of stopwords, and check for each tweets it will take too much time, if there any other efficient way to do it, and also i did not found .txt of list of stopwords, please help me with this.</p>
