<p>I need to make a search system for part numbers of products I have a ready database withe the real and correct part number f.ex :  'FX112 ES/6.12 14-4'</p>  <p>And I want to allow customers to receive correct results even if they enter the number without of special characters and spaces f.ex :  'FX112ES612144'</p>  <p>In the past I did it by creating another column with only alphanumeric values, and putting only LIKE %alphanumeric% result from search keyword to mysql query. But I think it must be something better / dedicated to that kind of situation. I believe that FULL TEXT can do it, but I can't make it works.</p>  <p>Any tip will be much appreciated.. Thanks!</p>
