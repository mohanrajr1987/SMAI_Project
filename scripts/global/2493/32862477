<p>I've recently started using Elastic Search and I'm in a situation where searching for a term that starts with <strong>ร</strong> will show empty results, while <strong>รถ</strong> shows the right results.</p>  <p>The mapping for <strong>city</strong> field is</p>  <pre><code>"city" =&gt; array(     "type" =&gt; "string",     "index" =&gt; "not_analyzed" ) </code></pre>  <p>I thought about lower the characters when the client searches for something, but I don't think that is the only solution. Would like to understand why is this happening?</p>
