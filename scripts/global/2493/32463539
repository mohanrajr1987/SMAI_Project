<p>I have a list of sentences (e.g. "This is an example sentence") and a glossary of terms (e.g. "sentence", "example sentence") and need to find all the terms that match the sentence with a cutoff on some Levenshtein ratio.</p>  <p>How can I do it fast enough? Splitting sentences, using FTS to find words that appear in terms and filtering terms by ratio works but it's quite slow. Right now I'm using sphinxsearch + python-Levelshtein, are there better tools?</p>  <p>Would the reverse search: FTS matching terms in sentence be faster? </p>
