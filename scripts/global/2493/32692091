<p>I have a relational database with alot of relations, and what I would like to be able to do is a full-text search across all tables.</p>  <p>So lets for instance say that we happen to have a Vehicle-table. This table has a relation (FK) to another table valled "Type" (that contains a vehicle-type, for instance car,truck,boat, airplane etc). The Vehicle-table also has a relation to another table called "Brand". That's the brand of the Vehicle (for instance, BMW,Princess,Volvo,Toyota,Boeing).</p>  <p>Now lets say that I want to make a full-text search based on this text: "bmw car" or maybe even "cars bwm" (since it would be nice to not force the user to always type things correctly.</p>  <p>How would I go about creating this full-text search with a relation-database as the data-source? Would this require me to "flatten" all the relations into one giant cross-join? (since it would be nice to avoid to flatten the realtions)</p>
