<p>I have a list of Movies.</p>  <pre><code>eg: Iron Man - 2008 Iron Man 2 - 2010 Iron Man 3 - 2013 Shawshank Redemption - 2000 </code></pre>  <p>I want to implement a search algorithm based on keywords. If I enter Iron, all 3 Iron Man movies should come up. Iron Man 2010, Only Iron Man 2 should come in the results.</p>  <p>I thought about TF-IDF, but it doesn't take order of words into consideration. ie, if there is a movie <code>Man Iron</code>, it will be have same ranking as <code>Iron Man</code> even though the keyword entered is <code>Iron Man</code>.</p>  <p>Which algorithm works best in this scenario, in which order of the occouring words is also considered?</p>
