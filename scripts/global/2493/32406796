<p>I have an output from a script which looks like this</p>  <pre><code>[{"fileName":"animated.avi","movieId":"34802240145","url":"http://vu.mycdn.me/upload.do?sig=2223a95d7e51832a09d03aa2f23ad3dec0a2c430\u0026expires=1441573849826\u0026clientType=0\u0026id=34802240145\u0026userId=569513266321","accessRights":0}] </code></pre>  <p>I need to extract the value of "url".</p>  <p>I tried using sed like this. Suppose the output is in temp.txt</p>  <pre><code>sed  '/url/,/accessRights/p' temp.txt </code></pre>  <p>Also tried using grep, but was unable to extract it.</p>
