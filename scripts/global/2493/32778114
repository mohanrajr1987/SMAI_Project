<p>I need to compare texts with minimal differences. For example, texts:</p>  <p>"Neil Armstrong famously planted a US flag on the Moon in 1969."</p>  <p>"Neil famously </p>  <p>planted a US flag on the Moon in 1969. "</p>  <p>"He famously </p>  <p>planted a USA flag on </p>  <p>Moon in 1969. "</p>  <p>Yep, texts are with different line breaks.</p>  <p>All of these texts must "be relevant".</p>  <p>My text are from 1 KB to 5 MB and text file with size 5 MB could contain text from another smaller (for example, 5 KB) duplicate file.</p>  <p>With what FTS engine it can be realized? Sphinx, Lucene, may be another?</p>  <p>Thank you very much!</p>
