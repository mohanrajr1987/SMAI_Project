<p>A typical model is to use Lucene to make server data searchable. I do this (painfully) with App Engine for instance. Does Parse provide its own mechanism for making data searchable? If no, may I integrate Lucene into it?</p>  <p>For some background, I will be creating a database with four tables. I want to be able to issue search queries such as "avocado recipes" and be able to show my users a ListView of results. You don't need to know android for this question, but my use case is android.</p>
