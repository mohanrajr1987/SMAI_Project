<p>I have access (<em>no source code</em>) to webservice to do street and poi search, the back end is using PostgreSQL. Is very good and accurated. Can weight the words to match <code>State</code> or <code>City</code>, know when is a <code>Street</code> or a <code>Building</code></p>  <p>If I search:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>"calle 15 lomas del avila"<br>   - "calle" mean STREET<br>   - "lomas del avila" is a sector in Caracas city.   Found a Bus station and the street name "calle 15"</p> </blockquote>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ghnj2.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ghnj2.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Now we got some source code for a <code>SQL Server 2012</code> version from the <strong>same provider</strong> as webservice. And this time I have the code.</p>  <p>But the result I get from the store procedure are very generic and return lot of result. Looks like the rank value is off because the better match appear on position 5 and 6</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/6jRra.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/6jRra.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Provider claim PostgreSQL is smarter that MSQL and can weight the words in better way. So the different result are caused by different engine.</p>  <p>I'm on the process of understand the MSQL code. But that claim make sense?</p>  <p>Is Postgresql text-search smarter than MSQL? I mean have both same capabilities or one have limit functionality. In postgres I know have some rank funcionality to make some part more importants.</p>
