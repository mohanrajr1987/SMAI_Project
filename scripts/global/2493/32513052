<p>I want to search for all occurrences of a word on the same line as well as multiple files within a given file. For example:</p>  <pre><code>ABCCG*CAT*AD*CAT*TT DFGBBB*CAT*YYUAB </code></pre>  <p>Manually searching for the word <code>'CAT'</code> i can count: 2 when using <code>/CAT</code> on vim, when in fact there are 3 occurrences of that word in the file.</p>  <p>What is the command in vim to retrieve all occurrences of a given word in a file irrespective of the fact that it may lie multiple times within a line?</p>  <p>Note: There are no <code>*</code> in the file. I have used it in the example above to denote the positions of the string <code>CAT</code>.</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I would like to amend my question to: what if the multiple occurrences were to overlap on the same line. For example:</p>  <pre><code>ABCCG*TNTNT*ADCATDD DFGBBB*TNT*YYUAB </code></pre>  <p>Searching for the word <code>TNT</code> using <code>:%s/TNT//gn</code> would still give me 2, when in fact there are 3 occurrences. Is there a way to identify overlapping occurrences in the same line using vim?</p>
