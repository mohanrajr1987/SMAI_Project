<p>Google deprecated their Freebase Search API, and is transferring things over to Wikidata, however there appears to be no replacement for their Freebase Search API (<a href="https://developers.google.com/freebase/v1/search-overview">https://developers.google.com/freebase/v1/search-overview</a>) that:</p>  <ul> <li>Autosuggesting entities (e.g. Freebase Suggest Widget) </li> <li>Getting a ranked list of the most notable entities with a given name. </li> <li>Finding entities using Search Metaschema.</li> </ul>  <p>Moreover, it would also take in malformed strings and correct them, and return nice detailed relevancy rankings, along with the associated freebase topic id. I can't find anything in their Custom Search API that returns any information relevant to their, or any other knowledge graph.</p>  <p>Ideally would like something that I can query similar to this and returns a result like they used to:</p>  <p>For example, a query of "Nirvana" in the Freebase Search API would return:</p>  <pre><code>{   "status":"200 OK",   "result":[     {       "mid":"/m/0b1zz",       "name":"Nirvana",       "notable":{"name":"Record Producer","id":"/music/producer"},       "score":55.227268     },{       "mid":"/m/05b3c",       "name":"Nirvana",       "notable":{"name":"Belief","id":"/religion/belief"},       "score":44.248726     },{       "mid":"/m/01h89tx",       "name":"Nirvana",       "notable":{"name":"Musical Album","id":"/music/album"},       "score":30.371510     },{       "mid":"/m/01rn9fm",       "name":"Nirvana",       "notable":{"name":"Musical Group","id":"/music/musical_group"},       "score":30.092449     },{       "mid":"/m/02_6qh",       "name":"Nirvana",       "notable":{"name":"Film","id":"/film/film"},       "score":29.003593     },{       "mid":"/m/01rkx5",       "name":"Nirvana Sutra",       "score":21.344824     }   ],   "cost":10,   "hits":0 } </code></pre>  <p>Note the relevance, and Freebase mid.</p>  <p>Essentially are there any alternatives out there, either open source, or commercial that replaces this much needed functionality?</p>
