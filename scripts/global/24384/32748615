<p>I am attempting to disable scrolling a <code>UIScrollView</code> after <code>scrollViewDidEndDragging</code> is called. I want the <code>UIScrollView</code> to only scroll when the user is scrolling with his/her finger. I haven't found a good way to implement this yet. I have attempting to disable and the enable scrolling, but when I use a flick motion to scroll, the <code>UIScrollView</code> continues scrolling. What I have in my code right now is:</p>  <pre><code>func scrollViewDidEndDragging(scrollView: UIScrollView, willDecelerate decelerate: Bool) {     scrollView.setContentOffset(self.contentOffset, animated: false)     scrollView.scrollEnabled = false     scrollView.scrollEnabled = true     ...  } </code></pre>  <p>Does anyone know how to immediately stop scrolling if a flick scroll motion is performed?</p>
