<p>I have searched a lot but not able to find anything fruitful.Here is my scenario:</p>  <p>I am making a horizontal <code>Image Slider(UIScrollView)</code>  which consist of multiple images. The slider is working fine. But the problem arises when I implement Pinch-In Zoom-In-Out`.</p>  <p>I am using this delegate method to zoom a particular Image:</p>  <pre><code>- (UIView *)viewForZoomingInScrollView:(UIScrollView *)scrollView {    return imgView; } </code></pre>  <p>Whenever I <code>zoom-I</code>n any image the Image next to it changes its position and the image which I am zooming after I leave my finger the image slighly shift to left and top . It not stoping where I want to stop.</p>  <p>What I have Done:  Programatically created image and added them to scrollView.</p>  <pre><code>xPointer = 0;   for(i=0;i&lt;[imgArr count];i++)    {     UIImageView *imgToZoom= [[UIImageView alloc]init];     imgToZoom.image = [imgArr objectAtIndex:i];     imgToZoom.tag = i+100;     imgToZoom.frame = CGRectMake(xPointer, _imagesScrollView.frame.origin.y-10, self.view.frame.size.width,_imagesScrollView.frame.size.height/2);     [imgToZoom setUserInteractionEnabled:YES];     [imgToZoom setMultipleTouchEnabled:YES];      [_imagesScrollView addSubview:imgToZoom];      xPointer = xPointer+self.view.frame.size.width;    }  _imagesScrollView.contentSize = CGSizeMake(xPointer, _imagesScrollView.frame.size.height); </code></pre>  <p>How can I implement Pinch In zoom. As When I done it using apple Doc My other images are changing there position.And Zoom in also not to the point.</p>
