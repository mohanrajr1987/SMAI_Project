<p>I have an <code>UIScrollView</code> with some <code>UITextFields</code> in it. The problem is that the view doesn't always trigger the <code>IBAction</code> of the Touch Down Event, but I don't know why. For example, if I press a certain <code>UITextField</code> it won't work the first time, it will work the second or third time or some random time... For reference, the screen looks something like this. I am also attaching the view hierarchy. </p>  <p>Image 1: View Layout</p>  <p>Image 2: View Hierarchy <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/w30tH.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/w30tH.png" alt="View Layout"></a></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/RHysx.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/RHysx.png" alt="View Hierarchy"></a></p>
