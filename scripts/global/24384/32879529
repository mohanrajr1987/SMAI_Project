<p>(ViewController--VC) I have a LeftDrawVC and a CenterVC(There are more than one VC in it and they are all inherit UIScrollView), when I pull-down the area of the UIConllectionView and the leftDraw shows up too. I tried to implement methods in ScrollViewDelegate set: </p>  <pre><code>- (void)scrollViewWillBeginDragging:(UIScrollView *)scrollView{ self.mm_drawerController.panGestureRecognizer.enabled = NO;}  - (void)scrollViewDidEndDecelerating:(UIScrollView *)scrollView{ self.mm_drawerController.panGestureRecognizer.enabled = YES;} </code></pre>  <p>works fine in one subClass of the UIScrollView, but i don't want to add these methods in every subClass to solve the conflict.   So, I want to know is there a easy way to solve the problem?   much appreciation.</p>
