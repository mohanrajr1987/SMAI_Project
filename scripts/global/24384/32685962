<p>I just noticed a behavior change that seems related to migrating to iOS 9.</p>  <p>I have a <code>UITableView</code>. In the first <code>UITableViewCell</code> I have a <code>UIScrollView</code> that I use to page through images. It should only scroll <strong>left&lt;-->right</strong>. Finger dragging up and down should drag the <code>UITableView</code> up and down. Up until iOS 9 it did do that beautifully...  Now when I compile for iOS9 devices or simulator I can still scroll the images <strong>left&lt;-->right</strong> but the table no longer scrolls up and down. Those touches just get sucked into the abyss.</p>  <p>Let me add that when I compile from Xcode 7 to my device running iOS 8.4 it still behaves as intended. Scrolls up and down when dragging in the embedded <code>UIScrollView</code>.</p>  <p>Furthermore, when I download my last released version (compiled on previously released Xcode for iOS 8.1 target I get the expected behavior on the iOS 9 phone. </p>  <p>Additional wrinkle of weirdness: if (back in xcode7 compiling live to iOS9 device again) I start scrolling vertically from one of the other cells and the table is still gliding to a stop THEN I CAN drag up and down from the <code>UIScrollView</code>. What the heck?</p>  <p>Anything obvious jump out here?</p>  <p>Thanks,</p>  <p>Bill</p>
