<ul> <li>I've got a scroll view (diagram: words) that is much longer than the device height</li> <li>At the bottom of the scroll view is some bottom content (diagram: french press) with a different background colour.</li> <li>To separate the bottom content from the words, I've created a 1pt high UIView to act as a border (diagram: red line)</li> <li>I have a button that sits on the bottom of the device, outside the scroll view (the scroll view is <code>device.height - button.height</code>). This button's background colour matches the bottom content's background colour.</li> </ul>  <p>The different background colours look pretty wonky without something separating the bottom button from the content view, so while the bottom content is NOT visible, I'd like the border to be sticky, and appear to be sitting above the bottom button (diagram: red line).</p>  <p>A small note: I'm using AutoLayout in IB, but I have an IBOutlet created for the border constraint that I can easily manipulate in code.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/PAaY8.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/PAaY8.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
