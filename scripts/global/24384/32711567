<p>I have a UIScrollView placed inside of a ViewController to which I have given AutoLayout Constraints and all of them are satisfied. The scrollView contains around 20 UIButton subviews. I have given autolayout constraints to them also and they all are also satisfied.</p>  <p>What I need to do is I want to animate those buttons when the view is first launched. This is my code for animation</p>  <pre><code>    for (UIButton *button in [scrollView subviews]) {     CGRect mainFrame = [button frame];     [UIView animateWithDuration:0.0 animations:^{         button.frame = CGRectMake(button.center.x, button.center.y, 0, 0);     } completion:^(BOOL finished) {         [UIView animateWithDuration:1 delay:0.5 usingSpringWithDamping:0.3 initialSpringVelocity:0.2 options:UIViewAnimationOptionCurveEaseOut animations:^{             button.frame = mainFrame;         } completion:^(BOOL finished) {         }];     }];  } </code></pre>  <p>The subviews are not animating when I use this code. But when I set the</p>  <pre><code>[button setTranslatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints:YES]; </code></pre>  <p>it works. But this time I get the error Unable to Simultaneously Satisfy constraints.</p>  <p>Is there any other method to do it or should I just ignore the error message and just go with it?</p>
