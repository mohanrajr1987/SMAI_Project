<p>I am using <code>UIScrollView</code> with dynamically loaded data from JSON, and I display view created depending on data that I receive.</p>  <pre><code>        var view = CustomView(frame: CGRectMake(5, scrollHeight, self.view.frame.width-10, 0), customClass: CustomClass)          scrollView.addSubview(view)         scrollHeight += view.frame.height + 25         scrollView.contentSize.height += view.frame.height+25 </code></pre>  <p>but i have too many elements, and it lasts for too long to load all views, how can I load only 10 of them for example, and the rest must be loaded while scrolling the <code>UIScrollView</code>? If I need to use some gesture recogniser to get my scroll event or something please write an example.</p>  <p>EDIT:</p>  <p>I implemented scrollViewDidScroll method but this way:</p>  <pre><code>func scrollViewDidScroll(scrollView: UIScrollView) {      if scrollView.contentOffset.y &gt; (scrollView.contentSize.height - 500) {             self.setViews(self.viewsArray)     } } </code></pre>  <p>It works fine, but not smoothly, it takes time for load, and during that time app freezes for a moment, how can i achieve more smooth behaviour of adding elements in runtime?</p>
