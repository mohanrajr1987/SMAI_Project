<p>I have a UIScrollView that is to show UIImageViews. The ImageViews are programmatically inserted at runtime based on how many images are saved by the user previously. I get the error below:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Unable to simultaneously satisfy constraints.</p>      <p>Probably at least one of the constraints in the following list is one   you don't want. Try this: (1) look at each constraint and try to   figure out which you don't expect; (2) find the code that added the   unwanted constraint or constraints and fix it. (Note: If you're seeing   NSAutoresizingMaskLayoutConstraints that you don't understand, refer   to the documentation for the UIView property   translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints)  </p>  <pre><code>"&lt;NSLayoutConstraint:0x17029cd90 H:[UIView:0x15cd31e70]-(0)-|   (Names: '|':UIScrollView:0x15cd326b0 )&gt;", "&lt;NSLayoutConstraint:0x17029d060 UIScrollView:0x15cd326b0.trailingMargin == UIView:0x15cd31e70.trailing&gt;" </code></pre> </blockquote>  <p>I do the basic Autolayout thing where the scrollview is pinned to all four sides at 0 points. I then add a contentView as a subview (plain UIView) of the UIScrollView which is also pinned to all four sides at 0 points. </p>  <p>EDIT Storyboard constraints image</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/7S6mt.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/7S6mt.png" alt="storyboard constraints on UIScrollview set to 0 on all sides to superview with Descendent constraints set to 0 to contentView "></a></p>  <p>I give the contentView a width in code like so:</p>  <pre><code>    CGSize pagesScrollViewSize = self.scrollView.frame.size;          NSDictionary *views     = @{ @"contentView"       :   self.contentView};          NSDictionary *metrics   = @{ @"width"           :   @(pagesScrollViewSize.width * self.mutableArray.count) };          NSArray *constraints;         constraints = [NSLayoutConstraint constraintsWithVisualFormat:@"H:|-[contentView(width)]-|" options:0 metrics:metrics views:views];         [self.scrollView addConstraints:constraints];  [self loadVisiblePages]; </code></pre>  <p>The UIImageViews are added like so where UIImageViews are added based on the number of pages set when the segue to the ViewController occurs. </p>  <pre><code>-(void)loadVisiblePages{          CGRect frame = self.scrollView.bounds;         frame.origin.x = frame.size.width * self.page;         frame.origin.y = 0.0f;          ImageForArchiving *newImageObject = (ImageForArchiving*)self.mutableArray[page];         UIImage *imageForNewPageView = newImageObject.image;          UIImageView *newPageView = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithFrame:frame];         [newPageView setTranslatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints:YES];          newPageView.contentMode = UIViewContentModeScaleAspectFit;         newPageView.image = imageForNewPageView;         [self.scrollView addSubview:newPageView];          [self.pageViews replaceObjectAtIndex:page withObject:newPageView];     } } </code></pre>  <p>Additionally, when I scroll the UIScrollView the images displayed change size erratically on rotation. I think that this is just a consequence of the above warning and the fact that I haven't layed out the UIImageViews yet. What does the above warning mean in this context and how do I fix it?</p>
