<p>I am having trouble using UIScrollView with Autolayout with the resulting layout being able to be localized. </p>  <p>In the normal examples, we are told to embed a "contentView" of type UIView of into the UIScrollview with its sides pinned to the 4 sides of the scrollview. The contentView must have explicit size, and subviews of this contentView will be pinned and sized accordingly. Easy enough.</p>  <p>However, this doesn't take into account localization. Apple's guidelines for localization state that UILabels and other string holding UIView types should not have an explicit width to account for content length. If UILabel subviews of the contentView are not given explicit widths, then the contentView also cannot have explicit width. How can the need for explicit size in the contentView to make scrollView work be reconciled with the need for flexible sizing for localization?</p>
