<p>I have a UITextView that takes up an entire scene (view). The textviews length varies depending on how much content there is. It could be very long and therefore does not all appear on the screen -- you have to scroll to see the rest. Also, the content could have images inside it using NSTextAttachment. <strong>My goal is to create an image of the entire textview. It should even include content that is offscreen (not currently visible)</strong>. Here is what I have so far:</p>  <pre><code>func textViewImage() -&gt; UIImage {      UIGraphicsBeginImageContext(textView.contentSize)      let savedContentOffset: CGPoint = textView.contentOffset     let savedFrame: CGRect = textView.frame      textView.contentOffset = CGPointZero     textView.frame = CGRectMake(0, 0, textView.contentSize.width, textView.contentSize.height)      textView.layer.renderInContext(UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext()!)     let image = UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext()      textView.contentOffset = savedContentOffset     textView.frame = savedFrame      UIGraphicsEndImageContext()      return image } </code></pre>  <p>This does not work. It only takes a picture of what is currently visible on the screen. I check to see if this code is working or not working by trying to <strong>share it by text message or mail</strong>:</p>  <pre><code> @IBAction func share(sender: UIBarButtonItem) {      let shareTextViewImage = textViewImage()     let activityController = UIActivityViewController(activityItems: [shareTextViewImage], applicationActivities: nil)      self.presentViewController(activityController, animated: true, completion: nil)  } </code></pre>  <p>I got as far as I did thanks to this post on SO and others <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3539717/getting-a-screenshot-of-a-uiscrollview-including-offscreen-parts">Getting a screenshot of a UIScrollView, including offscreen parts</a>.</p>  <p>Look forward to some help! Thanks!</p>  <p><strong>Update 1:</strong> I created this variable <code>var pageSize: CGSize = CGSizeMake(320, 800)</code> and tried adding it like so: <code>UIGraphicsBeginImageContext(pageSize)</code>. This does not work either since it only takes the current screen shot. Anyways this is a fixed size which wouldn't work in the long run since the content size could change --- just wanted to see how this would work out.</p>  <p>Still searching for answers...</p>
