<p>I want to detect when the user lifts their finger in a <code>UITableView</code> while they scroll, so in the <code>UIScrollView</code> delegate method <code>scrollViewDidScroll:</code> </p>  <pre><code>func scrollViewDidScroll(scrollView: UIScrollView) {     // Some codeâ€¦       if scrollView.panGestureRecognizer.state == .Ended     {         NSLog("ENDED")     } } </code></pre>  <p>To me this sounds like it should work, so when I investigated further and logged what states happen at this point, the only two logs were <code>Changed</code> and <code>Possible</code>.</p>  <p>To my understanding <code>Ended</code> should happen before possible if the gesture has ended.</p>  <p>Apple docs:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The gesture recognizer has received touches recognized as the end of a continuous gesture. It sends its action message (or messages) at the next cycle of the run loop and resets its state to UIGestureRecognizerStatePossible.</p> </blockquote>  <p>What exactly is going on here? And how do I find when the user lifts their finger off my <code>UITableView</code> during a scroll?</p>
