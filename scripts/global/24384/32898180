<p>So I've been trying to add a UIScrollView to my iOS application but I'm having a bit of trouble with it.  It doesn't seem to scroll when I put it in the simulator.</p>  <p>Here's what my View Controller looks like:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/U03b9.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/U03b9.png" alt=""></a></p>  <p>I even unchecked Autolayout and am sure that I have the two labels in the UIScrollView.</p>  <p>Any help is appreciated. </p>
