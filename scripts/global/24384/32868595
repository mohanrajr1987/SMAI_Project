<p>I have several UITextField s in a UIScrollView. A small problem I encountered was that when I tried to scroll the UIScrollView with my finger who was above a UITextField, the UIScrollView was not scrolling. But if I move my finger above a UILabel or other things, then I can scroll the UIScrollView.</p>  <p>So I'd like to know in a UITextField, who was stopping the UIScrollView from scrolling.</p>  <p>Thanks a lot.</p>
