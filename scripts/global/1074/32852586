<p>My Web application <a href="https://myapplication.com" rel="nofollow">https://myapplication.com</a> has a third party application configured that can be accessible from my web application menu Items.</p>  <p>The third party application is configured such that it uses the hostname of my application and rest of its URI is configured in the properties files as below</p>  <p><a href="https://myapplication.com/XnWebapp/abc" rel="nofollow">https://myapplication.com/XnWebapp/abc</a></p>  <p>When I click on this application from the menu, the home page of this application gets loaded with all the css and images files, but the javascript files of the third party application do not load. When i checked with the firebug for the request, I get 407 authentication required on the js files.</p>  <p>My application is configured on Weblogic server with Oracle Iplanet Webserver. The 3rd party application is hosted on Tomcat.</p>  <p>Could you please let me know any settings that are allowed in my app's Webserver to allow the javascript files.</p>
