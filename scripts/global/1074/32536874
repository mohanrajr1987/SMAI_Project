<p>I've set up my own webserver with apache and linked it to my ~/Sites folder. But its accessible trough </p>  <pre><code>http://localhost/~USERNAME/ </code></pre>  <p>How can I set this so it's accessible trough just </p>  <pre><code>http://localhost/ </code></pre>  <p>I've tried to look it up but my knowledge on this matter doesn't reach far enough to understand most of the things and I'm afraid I'll break something.</p>
