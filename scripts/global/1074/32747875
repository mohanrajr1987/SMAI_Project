<p>I have a requirement where I need to point <code>xyz.tld</code> to <code>abc.def.tld</code>. Additionally I would have to internally rewrite/redirect <code>abc.def.tld</code> to <code>def.tld/abc</code>. So the final result here I intend is when I visit <code>xyz.tld</code>, it should render contents of <code>def.tld/abc</code> without URL change. What is the idle way of achieving this? I have tried proxy_pass but when I do proxy pass, some static files (js files) at the root folder get messed up. Here is what I tried. Additionally I am not able to point xyz.tld to abc.def.tld using CNAME (as it resolves to IP).</p>  <pre><code>server {   listen 80;   server_name ~(?&lt;subdomain&gt;\w+)\.def\.tld;   location / {     proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000/$subdomain$request_uri;     proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;         proxy_set_header Host $host;  # pass the host header - http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpProxyModule#proxy_pass          proxy_http_version 1.1;  # recommended with keepalive connections - http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_http_version          # WebSocket proxying - from http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/websocket.html         proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;         proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;   } } </code></pre>  <p>Will a permanent redirect help? But if I do this, can I still point xyz.tld to abc.def.tld?</p>
