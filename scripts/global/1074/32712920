<p>I need to send to the customers a raw emails via my rails app.</p>  <p>When they click a link, a new page must open and they need to be able to see the source code of an email. I have a lot of cases where there are emails really big (even 40/50 mb), and it takes a lot of time to server to send it.  E.G.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>I have an email with 3 attachments, the total size is 30mb. My   controller method it takes 700 ms to process it and to retrieve the   raw source from imap server, but in the broswer, it takes up to 5   seconds. (2.5 to the first byte, 2.5 to download it).</p> </blockquote>  <p>Right now I just send the string with the render method. Is there a better way? where I am losing all that time?</p>  <p>To be more clear:</p>  <p>With the word 'send' I mean when the server has to 'send' the source code to the browser so the suer can visualize it </p>
