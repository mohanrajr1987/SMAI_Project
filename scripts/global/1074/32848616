<p>I'm using Docker with Vagrant and have a running container with an Apache 2 webserver. The website can be accessed without problems when the host is in a network with a connection to the internet. When the host disconnected, the website can only be accessed with its IP but not with its hostname anymore.</p>  <p>I'm using Ubuntu 14.04 as host. The Docker image is also based on ubuntu:14.04 image. How can I make the website accessible with the hostname when I'm not connected to LAN/Internet?</p>  <p>I've tried so far if it is possible to fix this by extending "/etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/" files because I think this might not be a Docker problem, but had no luck so far. The reason was that resolv.conf changes when I'm unconnected and removes a local nameserver IP. I also tried to start/stop and rebuild the containers after the disconnect in case that somewhere is a unaware service Docker is using (or even Docker itself)</p>  <p>I'm using the default docker0 and the Docker version is 1.6.2.</p>  <p>Important:</p>  <ul> <li>Using Vagrant is mandatory</li> <li>/etc/hosts is not an option</li> </ul>
