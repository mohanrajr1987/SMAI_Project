<p><strong>Task</strong></p>  <p>I have a java web server which provides access to an image that is saved as file from a webcam via opencv / javafx and which is periodically (e. g. every second) updated.</p>  <p><strong>Problem</strong></p>  <p>If the image is updated on the server while it's being delivered to a client, the image on the client is of course incomplete and gets corrupted.</p>  <p><strong>Question</strong></p>  <p>What is the preferred way to guarantee that the image which the client reads is always delivered as a whole? Or at least the image shouldn't be corrupted. </p>  <p>I wouldn't mind having e. g. the upper image part from the previous image, the lower part from the new image if that would be a solution, but how would you approach this?</p>
