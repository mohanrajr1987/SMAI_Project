<p>I have below rule in Nginx to redirect particular url to new url</p>  <pre><code>location /customer/my_info {   proxy_pass http://example.com/abc; } </code></pre>  <p>This works fine. I also have another url which I don't want to be redirected but it is being redirected. </p>  <pre><code>/customer/my_info_verify </code></pre>  <p>What rule needs to be added so that only fully matching url is being redirected? </p>
