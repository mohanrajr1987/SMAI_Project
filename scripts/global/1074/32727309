<p>When I ask for a flash file like <a href="http://www.example.com/test.swf" rel="nofollow">http://www.example.com/test.swf</a> on my Caddy server (<a href="http://caddyserver.com/" rel="nofollow">http://caddyserver.com/</a>), browsers start to download it instead of opening it. How to set up Caddy so flash file (*.swf) could be directly opened by browser. I think I need to define Mime type on the server side in Caddyfile. What parameter should I set ? Thank you. Marcel</p>
