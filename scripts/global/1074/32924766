<p>I have a domain name registered with Fasthosts. The nameservers are set to my shared hosting account, which I've been happily using for years.</p>  <p>However, I've recently developed a website that requires additional software and resources beyond what's available on my shared hosting - so it's running on Google Cloud Engine virtual machine.</p>  <p>I'd now like for the "www" dns zone of my domain to point to my Google VM, but email, ftp continues to use my shared hosting. One day I'll leave my share hosting entirely, but for now, this is my setup.</p>  <p>Using the cpanel of my shared hosting I can change the Zone File Records for my domain name. I thought setting the A record for www.mydomain.com. to my Google VP dedicated IP would do the trick. Alas, it does not - the domain won't resolve.</p>  <p>Any advice much appreciated.</p>  <p>-- </p>  <p>EDIT: Working now, I wasn't giving enough time for servers to propagate the change. Also I believed that all browsers visit www even if not explicitly addressed - but that doesn't seem to be the case - so I had to change the mydomain.com A record to my google ip, and set ftp.mydomain.com and mail.mydomain.com to my shared hosting dedicated IP, rather than mydomain.com.</p>
