<p>I have a docker instance that exposes a port A to the host. The host reserves a port B for the docker instance, and a client connecting to port B on the host will actually be communicating to the docker on port A without knowing it. </p>  <p>Currently, only one client can access this docker instance. I want to be able to manage multiple clients, each of them having its own instance. So the server (Python would be fine) would receive connections from clients on a port (e.g. port 5555 for <em>all</em> the clients) and redirect each client to its own docker instance seamlessly. </p>  <p>This has to already exist, because it is basic stuff for a server, but I seem to lack the vocabulary to find it online. What is the name of such a system, and does one already exist?</p>
