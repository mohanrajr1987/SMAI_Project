<p>I have a website and until some time ago it was administrated by a friend of mine; recently our relationships have been reduced, so I took the entire control of the website. </p>  <p>I'm not really expert with some aspects in the management of a web site. Actually I would make some back-end edits and I should connect with the server of the website.</p>  <p>I have the host IP, a username and a password. I tried to connect using Filezilla but I receive an error message: 530 Login incorrect. So, I contacted the domain provider, I was convinced that the domain provider was the same of the hosting provider, but they  told me that it was not true and that the hosting for the website is provided by "someone else" (it could be an other hosting provider or a private web-server, for example).</p>  <p>I don't know what to do. How can I connect to the server of my website? What am I missing?</p>  <p>p.s.: sorry for my bad english</p>
