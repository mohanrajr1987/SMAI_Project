For example download of 10 Mb file on localhost servers takes 10 seconds. </p>  <ol> <li>Do not suggest to extend buffer, because it impossible due error in org.vertx.java.core.net.impl.ConnectionBase#doSetWriteQueueMaxSize</li> <li>Of cause I can setup use apache and use mod cache, but I dont want to do this. </li> </ol>  <p>Any ideas how to speedup ? </p>
