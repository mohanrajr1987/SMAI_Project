<p>I have an ASP.NET site with a news system and I have currently added folders with static content (basic HTML with images) in order to provide a preview for a newsletter. I am getting the usual 404 error even though the new folder with the static content exists. Also, other folders with static content work OK and updating any previous static HTML does not work so I'm guessing it's a server cache issue. I have recycled the AppPool and restarted the Website to no avail.</p>  <p>Any other ideas as to what to check?</p>
