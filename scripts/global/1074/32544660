<p>By default, Java applications based on <a href="http://sparkjava.com" rel="nofollow">Spark Framework</a> will run on its embedded <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/" rel="nofollow">Jetty</a> server, on your host machine. However, if you use <strong>Vagrant</strong> as your virtualized development environment, this default Spark setup will obviously not work.</p>  <p>So, how can you run your Spark-based application from your Vagrant virtual box?</p>
