<p>I am implementing a little webmail with a rails backend that talks with an IMAP server. The problem is that when I retrieve some raw data, if the attachment is big (even 6/7 mb) it take so much time to webrick to send it. </p>  <p>How can I improve the performance of sending "big data"? Is there a more suited webserver? </p>  <p>(I haven't tried the other yet, because I am yet in the early stages of development)</p>
