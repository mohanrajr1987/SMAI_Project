<p>I have JBoss web application in Project 1. This project depends on Project 2's one function to produce a file and store the file under Project's src/main/resources directory.</p>  <p>Since this part of the functionality can be tested independently without launching the Web application, I can test the file is generated successfully and stored under the directory ../src/main/resources in Project 2 by executing the "Run as Java application" in Project 1.  </p>  <p>However, if I run this web application on "Run as server", it fails. Debugging shows that it can't successfully store the generated file into the ../src/main/resources in Project2.</p>  <p>Is there something special to prevent the file being stored in the directory when it is run as a web application on a web server? </p>
