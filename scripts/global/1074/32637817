<p>I am using <a href="http://restless.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html" rel="nofollow">Restless</a> in my flask app. I make an API resource, doing something like the following...</p>  <pre><code>from restless.fl import FlaskResource  class WidgetResource(FlaskResource):     preparer = FieldsPreparer(fields={         'id': 'id',         'name': 'name'      }      ...  WidgetResource.add_url_rules(app, rule_prefix='/api/widgets/')  </code></pre>  <p>The resource has a list and detail view defined, though they're not shown above. I could include if necessary. Now to the question. In production, I noticed that this route...</p>  <pre><code>/api/widgets// </code></pre>  <p>returns the same result (though NOT redirecting to it) as...</p>  <pre><code>/api/widgets/ </code></pre>  <p>That is, it's a 200 result, showing the widgets' list view. However, with my development server, the first route yields a 404, as if it is hitting the detail view, like I would expect, and passing an empty primary key. What would cause this discrepancy of behavior on my prod server vs. the dev server?</p>  <p>To be clear, the dev server's behavior is what I am TRYING to get to happen. </p>
