<p>I have been trying to get an simple nanohttpd server running but I cant figure out how to set it up.. I have tried to follow this guide: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14309256/using-nanohttpd-in-android">Using NanoHTTPD in Android</a> tried the first answer but I get an error on this line: "private WebServer server;" "cannot resolve symbol 'WebServer'"</p>  <p>also tried following this: <a href="https://github.com/NanoHttpd/nanohttpd/wiki/How-to-use-NanoHttpd" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/NanoHttpd/nanohttpd/wiki/How-to-use-NanoHttpd</a> another error on this line: "return newFixedLengthResponse(sb.toString());" "error 'newFixedLengthResponse cannot be resolved."</p>  <p>I tried just adding the nanohttpd.class as well as importing nanohttpd.jar but neither seem to make a difference.</p>  <p>Does anyone know of a simple 'hello world' guide to nanohttpd that actually works? Or maybe a more documented simple web server for android?</p>
