<p>I want to make simple service that each user will have his own (simple and light) webserver.  I want to use an AWS instance to do this.</p>  <p>I understand that I can do that by starting Python's SimpleHTTPserver (Proof of concept) multiple times on different ports, and that the number of servers I can have depends on the resources. </p>  <p>My question is:</p>  <p>Is it a better practice or an overkill to <strong>Dockerize</strong> each user with his server ? </p>
