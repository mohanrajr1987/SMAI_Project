<p>I have a really strange problem - we created a tailored CMS-System for our clients (html, css, js, php, mysql) we have a built-in mediathek, the problem is the file-uploader.</p>  <p>When I upload a file (with ajax), my console tells me (errors are logged in the console) "Request Entity Too Large" - this error appears every time, when iItry to upload a file > 1MB</p>  <p>The strange thing here is, that we have a url with many subdomains and on every other subdomain it works perfectly, its the same cms with the same settings... can you help me?</p>  <p>What I already tried:</p>  <ul> <li>.htaccess: LimitRequestBody 99999999999 / LimitRequestBody 0 </li> </ul>
