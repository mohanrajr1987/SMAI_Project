<p>I am facing a problem while using hyphen - in a string which has the font as below. Since hyphen is used in the font as some character. So how can I put this hyphen into a string which uses the said font.</p>  <pre><code>$word = new COM("word.application") or die("Unable to instantiate Word"); $word-&gt;Documents-&gt;Add(); $word-&gt;Visible = 1; $word-&gt;Selection-&gt;Font-&gt;Name = 'malfont'; $word-&gt;Selection-&gt;TypeText("Hi - Hello - How - are - you"); </code></pre>  <p>I get a output where - is missing but If I change the font name as 'Calibri' then I will get the hyphen. So how can I avoid this. </p>
