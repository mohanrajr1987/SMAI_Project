<p>I try to avoid using Type Libraries for COM automation with C#, but instead using the dynamic keyword to resolve types at runtime. This works fine, except when trying to define event handler.</p>  <p>I've tried to define it this way:</p>  <pre><code>_COMObject.OnStop += new Action(OnStop); </code></pre>  <p>The original COM object however defines its ownEventHandler type with no arguments and no return value. Thus of course Action is not the same type then and this results in a RuntimeBinderException stating that it can not convert the Action type to the ComObjectCustomEventHandler although they have the same signature.</p>  <p>I would need to have something like a dynamic delegate, however I haven't figured out how to define it.</p>
