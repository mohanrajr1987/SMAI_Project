<p>I have a Python program using COM objects that I'd like to run remotely. That program runs well on the local machine, but when I run the program on a remote machine and try to use DCOM objects to remotely connect to the COM object on the remote machine, NTLM authentication fails (seen in a Wireshark capture).</p>  <p>The machine is on a Windows domain, but I can create as many local user on both machine as I like. I've tried creating the same local user on both machine, but the DCOM object is passing the machine as the domain (i.e trying to authenticate to <code>Machine2</code> with <code>Machine1\user</code>).</p>  <p>Any advice?</p>  <p><strong>Is there a way with <code>pythoncom</code> or <code>win32com</code> to specify a different user and password to use for NTLM authentication?</strong></p>  <p>I'm more than willing to answer any questions and add as many details as I possibly can.</p>  <p>Code:</p>  <pre><code>print "\nConnecting to '%s'" % LAHostNameOrIP ; try:     LAConnect = win32com.client.Dispatch("AgtLA.Connect")     # Fails on the LAConnect.GetInstrument call     LAInst = LAConnect.GetInstrument(LAHostNameOrIP) except pythoncom.com_error, (hr, msg, exc, arg):     print "The AgtLA call failed with code: %d: %s" % (hr, msg)     if exc is None:         print "There is no extended error information"     else:         wcode, source, text, helpFile, helpId, scode = exc         print "The source of the error is", source         print "The error message is", text         print "More info can be found in %s (id=%d)" % (helpFile, helpId)     sys.exit(1) </code></pre>
