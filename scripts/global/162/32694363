<p>I have a compiler error: "error C3505: cannot load type library".</p>  <p>I have a COM 32/64 bit component, which is successfully compiled with msvc 2012 in both configurations. I also have a test application which loads this COM component during start with the lines:</p>  <pre><code> #define ID_STRING "libid:c734d1af-8cbe-4cae-b501-165099037e41"   #import ID_STRING version("0.1") no_namespace </code></pre>  <p>In the 32bit variant everything works fine. But in 64bit I see the above-mentioned compiler error. It says <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms235597.aspx" rel="nofollow">here</a> that the problem is in WOW bitness stuff. I've checked registry. Corresponding type library could be found in both nodes:</p>  <ul> <li><code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\TypeLib\{c734d1af-8cbe-4cae-b501-165099037e41}</code></li> <li><code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Wow6432Node\TypeLib\{c734d1af-8cbe-4cae-b501-165099037e41}</code></li> </ul>  <p>So where am I wrong?</p>  <p>UP: I've found a problem. Compile tries to load type library from 32bit dll (only in compilation stage, in runtime program uses 64bit version). So the question is how made compiler use 64bit type library while compilation.</p>
