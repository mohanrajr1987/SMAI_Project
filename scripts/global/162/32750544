<p>In my native app, I want to create shortcuts (.lnk files) but IPersistFile::Save fails with "E_ACCESSDENIED General access denied error" even I try to save shortcuts in personal folders (privileged directories).</p>  <p>I also tried and complied the following samples, but it ended up with the same error message.</p>  <p>Code Samples: <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa969393.aspx" rel="nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa969393.aspx</a></p>  <p>FYI, when I run the executable as administrator, the above code works as expected.</p>
