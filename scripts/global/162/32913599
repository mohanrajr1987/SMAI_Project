<p>After using recommendations found on this site, we still are having a problem. We are using FAXCOMLib in a Windows Service on Windows Server 2012. It is running under a local account with administrator rights. The file type is text (txt) and the association is set to Notepad. </p>  <p>However, the FaxDoc Send method is failing with the </p>  <blockquote>   <p>HRESULT 0x8007000D data is invalid</p> </blockquote>  <p>error. I verified the fax number and recipient name are valid. The error message does not seem to indicate the real problem. Does anyone have some insight into what else could be causing this to fail? Thanks in advance.</p>
