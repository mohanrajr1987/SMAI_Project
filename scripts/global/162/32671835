<p>I have problems with large COM client application (~50 projects) randomly crashing/hanging/etc when run under MSVC debugger. It is hard to understand what exactly is happening.</p>  <p>When my C++ code calls some method of COM object, it uses helper function <code>_com_dispatch_method</code> internally to perform a call. I'd like to trace execution deeper into this helper method. When I try to <em>step into</em> this helper, Visual Studio asks me for source file <code>comsupp.cpp</code>. Indeed, I can still continue step-by-step through assembly code without it, but it is very tedious.</p>  <p>Is it possible to get original source code for these helper methods (i.e. <code>comsupp.cpp</code>, <code>invkprxy.cpp</code>, etc) ?</p>  <p>I know that Microsoft makes available sources of CRT library. Also, it seems that at least at some moment COM helper classes were also available: I can see them <a href="http://biosystems.okstate.edu/home/prashm%20-%20keep/prashant/VS.NET%20setup%20files/PROGRAM%20FILES/MICROSOFT%20VISUAL%20STUDIO%20.NET/VC7/CRT/SRC/COMPILER%20SUPPORT/COMSUPP.CPP" rel="nofollow">here</a> (I guess those are for MSVC2003).</p>
