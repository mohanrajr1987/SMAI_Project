<p>Is it possible to reference a COM-registered DLL and then create objects that require arguments in the constructor in VBA code?</p>  <p>I'm successfully referenced the tlb in Access 2013 (64-bit) that was registered with <code>regasm</code>, and I've managed to create a simple object that doesn't need arguments in the constructor.</p>  <p>From what I read, it is not. Do I now face major refactoring?</p>
