<p>I'm trying to get audio data from a specific running process. This process uses XAudio2, which as i read eventually calls WASAPI code to send sound data to the audio device. Great.</p>  <p>To send sound to the audio device, WASAPI uses the IAudioRenderClient interface, which has two methods: GetBuffer() and ReleaseBuffer(). If i manage to hook these, i should be able to get the audio data from the buffer.</p>  <p>The problem is that i can't seem to figure out how to locate these methods. I'm familiar with Import/Export tables for DLL's, but WASAPI seems to be using COM? COM isn't mentioned anywhere on MSDN for WASAPI.</p>  <p>The interface definition can be found in Windows' AudioClient.h, which defines the IAudioRenderClient in this manner:</p>  <pre><code>MIDL_INTERFACE("F294ACFC-3146-4483-A7BF-ADDCA7C260E2") IAudioRenderClient : public IUnknown { public:     virtual HRESULT STDMETHODCALLTYPE GetBuffer(          /* [annotation][in] */          _In_  UINT32 NumFramesRequested,         /* [annotation][out] */          _Outptr_result_buffer_(_Inexpressible_("NumFramesRequested * pFormat-&gt;nBlockAlign"))  BYTE **ppData) = 0;      virtual HRESULT STDMETHODCALLTYPE ReleaseBuffer(          /* [annotation][in] */          _In_  UINT32 NumFramesWritten,         /* [annotation][in] */          _In_  DWORD dwFlags) = 0;  }; </code></pre>  <p>Super. So the GUID/UUID for the interface should be "F294ACFC-3146-4483-A7BF-ADDCA7C260E2"</p>  <p>I've searched for this UUID through my registry, and found nothing. I've used the OLE/Com Object Viewer, and I haven't been able to find this interface there either.</p>  <p>Where are these actual methods stored? What does this UUID point to?</p>
