<p>My apologies for the vagueness of this question.</p>  <p>During the migration of an application to a new server environment, a COM component (.dll) file that exposes an API for the application has stopped working. </p>  <p>Is there any way I can troubleshoot a COM component? Is there standard way for a COM component to log faults (there are no events in the Windows Event Viewer)? Can I 'inspect' a component in any way?</p>  <p>I have successfully registered the component using regsvr32.exe (I have no idea what this actually does other than creating some Windows Registery settings).</p>  <p>Martijn</p>
