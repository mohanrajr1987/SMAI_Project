<p>I have embeded a WPF user control in a windows application using an <strong>ElementHost</strong> by setting the <strong>Child</strong> property to the custom user control. </p>  <p>Unfortunately, my text boxes are not receiving any input from key presses so I can't use my add-in at all. </p>  <p>I thought I found a work-around when I found the following line of code. </p>  <pre><code>ElementHost.EnableModelessKeyboardInterop([System.Windows.Window]); </code></pre>  <p>This will not work since I am not using a window. In fact, there is no way to host a System.Windows.Window in the element host or use the window as the host.</p>  <p>This add-in didn't have any text input feature until quite a bit into the development so it things have come to a complete stand-still. </p>  <p>How can I get the input to be accepted by my text boxes?</p>
