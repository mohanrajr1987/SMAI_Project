<p>I've used <strong>COM addins</strong> for some years and I've observed that often <strong>new versions</strong> were the cause of serious issues including crashes at <strong>Excel</strong> startup or when <strong>COM components</strong> are used.</p>  <p>From what I understand this is due to the internal Excel plumbing caching some information about the COM addin (inside the XLS/XLSX/XLA/XLAM file) that don't match its new versions: e.g. if a new method has been added to the API, or a new parameter has been added to a method.</p>  <p>This is really annoying as it forces us to remove the references in the <strong>VBA editor</strong> <em>"Tools" -> "References"</em> menu, close the popup, and add them back, which AFAIK forces Excel to resync with the current state of the addin.</p>  <p>A "simple" fix would be to add a hook on <em>Workbook_Open</em>, for each distributed workbook, to automatically remove, if it exists, then add each reference back.</p>  <p>Do you have any other/better idea ?</p>
