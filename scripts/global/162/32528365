<p>Hi I am new to python programming. I know how to dispatch a com object <strong>(ex: obj = win32com.client.Dispatch('Excel.Application')</strong>. This will start the application process.</p>  <p>Can anyone explain how to get the Com object from process? I want to get the com object for any process listed in the process list of windows so that I can execute the methods of the retreived com object.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
