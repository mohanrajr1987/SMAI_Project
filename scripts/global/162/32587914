<p>Hello,<br> We have a COM dll from FoxPro that we're trying to consume on a WebApi project (not WebApi2). What we have done:</p>  <ul> <li>created a C# console application, works fine both in locale and on the server</li> <li>created a C# WebApi project, works in locale, doesn't work when deployed</li> </ul>  <p>The server:</p>  <ul> <li>Windows Server 2003 RC2</li> <li>IIS 6</li> </ul>  <p>The COM object:</p>  <ul> <li>is registered on the server (using regsvr32)</li> <li>is visible in <code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\</code> but not in the <code>DCOM config</code> list (weird?)</li> </ul>  <p>Experiments:</p>  <ul> <li>Changed folder and IIS application pool permission to the max</li> <li>Deleted the <code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\</code> key: console app still works!!</li> <li>Published the web service both in Debug and Release mode</li> </ul>  <p>Finally, the error that occurs when I call the WS (translated from Italian):</p>  <pre><code>Cannot load file or assembly 'file:///C:\Inetpub\wwwroot\WebFox\bin\vfpcomtest.dll' or one of its dependencies. The module needs to contain an assembly manifest </code></pre>  <p>Shouldn't it call the <code>Interop.</code> version?</p>  <p>Any idea?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
