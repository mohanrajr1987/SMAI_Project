<p>I'm working with Kofax Capture Workflow Agents. I have installed some WFAs before, but they didn't run on first try and I'm not really sure what I've done to get them working.</p>  <p>Currently, I follow these steps to install my WFA:</p>  <ol> <li>Compile my Source-Files to one DLL</li> <li>Remove Workflow Agent from Batch Classes</li> <li>Uninstall Workflow Agent over Tools > Workflow Agents</li> <li>Copy over to my Test-Environment</li> <li>Install Workflow Agent over Tools > Workflow Agents</li> <li>Add Workflow Agents to Batch Classes</li> <li>Publish Batches</li> <li>Close Administration and Run new Batch in Batch Manager</li> </ol>  <p>I have installed this particular WFA before and I was able to use it before. This is why I am always using the same AEX-File as none of the Properties change. But somehow, it suddenly stopped working and I can't re-install it properly. Am I doing something wrong?</p>  <p><strong>Edit:</strong><br />  I tried out a lot of things with the best result when I changed the whole AEX-entry. I'm pretty much giving Kofax another Workflow Agent, as name, progid, file and version is different.</p>  <p>I'll have to find out which of these are really needed, but I got a lot of 429 ActiveX errors and I'm not sure whether I registered the DLL by windows or not.</p>
