<p>I am trying to get a handle on an excel graph and save it through MATLAB. </p>  <p>So far I have managed to cycle through sheets and get a handle on the graph object but I can't save it.<br> Does anyone know how to export the object as a <code>jpg</code> or <code>png</code> or other graphic format?</p>  <p>I tried the code below using the <code>SaveAs</code> method but it doesn't work</p>  <pre><code>Workbook = Workbooks.Open(['file.name]); Sheets = Workbook.Sheets; for i = 1:Sheets.Count     Activesheet = get(Sheets, 'Item',i);     for j = 1:Activesheet.ChartObjects.Count         obj = Activesheet.ChartObjects(j);         obj.SaveAs('asfasfa.jpg')      end end </code></pre>
