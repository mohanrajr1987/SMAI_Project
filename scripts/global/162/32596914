<p>I have created a user Control in C# (as a class library). Now I have registered the class (using <code>regasm</code>) and I can use this control on a <code>VBA</code> user-form. All the methods,events and properties works as expected. But When I am trying to add new methods to the Interface, I can't see them in VBA. Is it possible to update an already registered COM's interface?</p>  <p>If yes, can you please provide some guidance.</p>
