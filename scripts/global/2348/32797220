<p>I have two different executable (<code>run1</code> and <code>run2</code>). I want to run them simultaneously. They share one readonly input file, but otherwise, they are different process.  Is it possible to call the <code>call</code>'s  simultaneously? Currently, as I have coded, <code>cmd2</code>'s call wait for <code>cmd1</code>'s call to complete.</p>  <pre><code>with open(dosout, "w") as dout, open(jijout, "w") as jout:     cmd1 = ["mpirun", "-np", "8", "~/WORK/run1", dosinp]     cmd2 = ["mpirun", "-np", "8", "~/WORK/run2", jijinp]     call(cmd1, stdout=dout)     call(cmd2, stdout=jout) dout.close() jout.close() </code></pre>  <p>Is it possible with <code>call</code>?  or <code>Popen</code> from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/24313858/2005559">this</a> answer is the only (or better) way out?</p>
