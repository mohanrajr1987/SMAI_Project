<p>I am trying to run multiple python programs in sequence and I want to capture the stdout or the output  of each process in a file or files using tempfile or (if there is a better way to do that will be awesome). The output which will be file or multiple files generated from process 1 will be used as input for the next process. How to do that?</p>  <p>So my code is something like this:</p>  <pre><code># multiple files for file in files:   P1 = Popen('python Prog1.py' + ' ' + file, stdout=PIPE , stderr=STDOUT,shell=True)   # Now I want to capture the output to files so can be used for the next process   # It didn't work   l_out_files.append(P1.stdout)   # Prog2 require if the input file is more than one to have them separated by space  P2 = Popen('python Prog2.py' + ' ' + ' '.join( l_out_files), stdout=PIPE , stderr=STDOUT,shell=True) </code></pre>  <p>Thanks a lot guys,</p>  <p>Best</p>
