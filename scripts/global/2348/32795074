<p>I am currently writing a python script that will automate make files that are there in various directories under my project. The directory structure is like this :</p>  <pre><code>                Repository                   |                   |             _____ |_____            |            |          Builds        src            |            |          __|__        __|__    Scripts   xyz     abc   3rdpartytools     |                          |     conf                     boost     |                          | script1.py                     b2 </code></pre>  <p>script1.py is my python file and all the make files that I want to execute are present under the 3rdpartytools directory. boost directory is just an example. Now, I want to execute file <code>b2</code>. From the shell, ./b2 works.</p>  <p>I tried using subprocess.call from the python file. I tried </p>  <p><code>call(["cd"," ../../../src/3rdpartytools/boost;./b2"])</code> but i get <code>/usr/bin/cd: line 2: cd: ../../../src/3rdpartytools/boost/b2: No such file or directory</code></p>  <p>The same command when I execute from shell, works fine.</p>  <p>Python 2.7 and CentOS.</p>
