<p>Good morning,<br/> I am writing a Python script for comparing two installers. Therefore I am using "sfk" (Swiss File Knife) technology for browsing through the unzipped directories, including browsing inside *.jar files). <br/> My script looks as follows:<br/></p>  <pre><code>  cmd_sfk1 = "sfk list -hidden -arc -time -size -tofile content_dir1.txt " + lv_inst_dir1   cmd_sfk2 = "sfk list -hidden -arc -time -size -tofile content_dir2.txt " + lv_inst_dir2    try:     subprocess.call(cmd_sfk1)   except Exception as ex:     ...    try:     subprocess.call(cmd_sfk2)   except Exception as ex:     ... </code></pre>  <p>As you can see, the results are written in two files (content_dir1.txt) and (content_dir2.txt), and it's the idea that a simple file comparison gives me the difference between both directories/file tree.</p>  <p>However, this is not working as the name of the directory is included in the file, here's an excerpt:</p>  <pre><code>... 2015-09-29 14:04:20          119 Dir1\InstallerData\...\MediaId.properties 2015-09-29 14:00:08          357 Dir1\InstallerData\...\\my.ini ... </code></pre>  <p>The presence of "Dir1" in that file messes up the comparison.<br/></p>  <p>I see one "simple" solution: modifying the target directory of the commands, something like:<br/></p>  <pre><code>  cmd_sfk1 = "sfk list -hidden -arc -time -size -tofile ../content_dir1.txt " + "."   cmd_sfk2 = "sfk list -hidden -arc -time -size -tofile ../content_dir2.txt " + "."    try:     subprocess.call(cmd_sfk1, target_directory=lv_inst_dir1)   except Exception as ex:     ...    try:     subprocess.call(cmd_sfk2, target_directory=lv_inst_dir2)   except Exception as ex:     ... </code></pre>  <p>(a bit like "pushd" and "popd" in DOS batch-files)<br/> The intention is to end up with following content_dir1.txt content:<br/></p>  <pre><code>... 2015-09-29 14:04:20          119 InstallerData\...\MediaId.properties 2015-09-29 14:00:08          357 InstallerData\...\\my.ini ... </code></pre>  <p>(without "Dir1")<br/> And now my question: does anybody know how to modify the target directory of a subprocess in Python?<br/></p>  <p>Thanks<br/> Dominique</p>
