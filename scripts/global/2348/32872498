<p>I'm using Python 3.5.  I'm launching ffmpeg to record a file but I can't seem to kill the process.  I've tried this:</p>  <pre><code>import os import subprocess  pro = subprocess.Popen(recordcommand, shell=True) ... do some things; wait for a stop command to come in  ... if msg =='STOP':      pro.kill() </code></pre>  <p>My process starts fine but it never stops.  I do not get any errors.  I've checked the API and thought I was doing things right.  Can anyone tell me where I'm going wrong?  Thanks!</p>  <p>Edit:  Fixed pro.kill to pro.kill() but still not working.  Here's the command I'm sending:</p>  <pre><code> C:/Users/User/Desktop/ffmpeg-20150928-git-235381e-win64-static/bin/ffmpeg.exe -f dshow  -crossbar_video_input_pin_number 2 -i video="ATI AVStream Analog Capture" -f mpegts -fs 16777216 -y D:\Media\tvrecordings\SageSlingBox1onlocalhost4510TVTuner-0.mpgbuf 2&gt;NUL </code></pre>  <p>Perhaps something is keeping it from being killed?  I forgot to mention that my OS is Win 7 64 bit.</p>
