<p>I need to run an OpenFOAM command by automatized python script.</p>  <p>My python code contains the lines</p>  <pre><code>subprocess.Popen(['OF23'], shell=True) subprocess.Popen(['for i in *; do surfaceConvert $i file_path/$i.stlb; done', shell=True) </code></pre>  <p>where OF23 is a shell  command is defined in alias as</p>  <pre><code>alias OF23='export PATH=/usr/lib64/openmpi/bin/:$PATH;export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib64/openmpi/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH;source /opt/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-2.3.x/etc/bashrc' </code></pre>  <p>This script runs the OpenFOAM command in terminal and the file_path defines the stl files which are converted to  binary format</p>  <p>But when I run the script, I am getting 'OF23' is not defined.</p>  <p>How do I make my script to run the alias command and also perform the next OpenFOAM file conversion command</p>
