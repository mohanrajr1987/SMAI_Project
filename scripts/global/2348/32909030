<p>I want to kill a process after 5 minutes (ex), which I've opened with</p>  <pre><code>subprocess.Popen() p = subprocess.Popen('calc.exe', shell=True)  # example </code></pre>  <p>I've printed the pip with <code>print(p.pid)</code>, slept for 10 seconds with <code>time.sleep(10)</code> , then killed the process with <code>p.kill()</code>.</p>  <p>The problem is that <code>calc.exe</code> is still running. I've used the <code>Process Explorer</code> to see what happens here and it seems that the subprocess will create a cmd with pid = <code>p.pid</code> which creates <code>calc.exe</code>, but with another pid which I don't know.</p>  <p>All code here:</p>  <pre><code>import subprocess, os, time  p = subprocess.Popen('calc.exe', shell=True)  time.sleep(1) print(p.pid) p.kill() </code></pre>  <p>So what I'm doing wrong?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
