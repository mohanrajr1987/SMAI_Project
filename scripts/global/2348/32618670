<p>so I'm such a noob in Python it's painful but I'm trying to come up with a way to PING a site, then spit out an 'if/else' clause.</p>  <p>So far I have this:</p>  <pre><code>import subprocess  command = "ping -c 3 www.google.com"  # the shell command process = subprocess.Popen(command, stdout=subprocess.PIPE,      stderr=None, shell=True)  #Launch the shell command: output = process.communicate()  print output[0] </code></pre>  <p>Below is where I go awry, here is part two:</p>  <pre><code>if output == 0.00 print "server is good"  else print "server is hosed" </code></pre>  <p>Obviously part 2 is not working out. </p>  <p>My question is, how do I "read" the results from the ping (the milliseconds)     icmp_seq=0 ttl=44 time=13.384 ms</p>  <p>and say "if the ping time is faster than 12.000 ms then do THIS" else     "do THAT"</p>  <p>Right now I'm just doing a print but soon I'd like to change that so something else. </p>
