<p>When I run the following in Python 3.2.3 in Linux it does nothing...</p>  <pre><code>subprocess.call("export TZ=Australia/Adelaide", shell=True) </code></pre>  <p>However if I run it in the terminal it works...</p>  <pre><code>export TZ=Australia/Adelaide </code></pre>  <p>I haven't had an issue with using subprocess.call before. Just seems to be this one. I'm running as a superuser so it's not a sudo thing, and I've also tried putting an r in front of the string to make it a raw string.</p>  <p>Any ideas? Thanks.</p>
