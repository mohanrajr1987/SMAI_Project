<p>My shell program "test.c" is in my android(custom AOSP). program name is "test"</p>  <p>This program is print timestamp to console(stdout) infinitely until Ctrl+C</p>  <p>Problem is that different result between through adb in terminal(<code>adb shell test</code>) and in android Programaically code <code>Runtime.getRuntime().exec("test")</code></p>  <p>Detail difference is these's sync. Although these process kill at the same time, adb shell test well done. but exec("test") feels like incomplete</p>  <p>In Android code, use a exec("text").getInputStream() and read all data until exist</p>  <p>like this,</p>  <p>[adb shell test result]</p>  <p>1 2 3 4 5 6 7</p>  <p>[exec("test") result]</p>  <p>1 2 3 4 5</p>  <p>how to get a same result from this?</p>
