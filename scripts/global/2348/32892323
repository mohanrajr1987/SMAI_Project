<p>Hi I've got the following written in a python script pythonscript1.py in linux debian in the directory /home/user/a/:</p>  <pre><code>import subprocess subprocess.call(["python" /home/user/b/phpcall.py"]) </code></pre>  <p>where the phpcall.py script contains:</p>  <pre><code>import subprocess subprocess.call(["php", "/home/user/b/phpscript1.php"]) </code></pre>  <p>individually called from console all scripts function perfectly, but when I use the first script whilst the 2nd script calls/looks for a file in directory b, rather than a, It yields the following error:</p>  <pre><code>"PHP warning: include_once(something.php): failed to open stream: no such file in /home/user/b/phpschript1.php on line 25 </code></pre>  <p>Now it is quite clear to me the problem is that it cannot reach out of it's original directory. But I don't know what command I should add to the first script to allow the 2nd script to look in folder b.</p>  <p>So far google results have suggested something with "include_path='include'" but I don't know how/where to incorporate the statement succesfully. </p>  <p>Any suggestions on the correct syntax would be appreciated!</p>
