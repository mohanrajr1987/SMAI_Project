<p>I am having trouble inserting a tr command into a subprocess.</p>  <p>I have the following:</p>  <pre><code>process = subprocess.Popen('"tr &lt; " + inputFile + " -d '\000' &gt; " + nullFile', shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE) </code></pre>  <p>but keep getting </p>  <pre><code>TypeError: execv() arg 2 must contain only strings </code></pre>  <p>Can anyone see whats going on? It looks like it may be ' and " issues but not sure. </p>
