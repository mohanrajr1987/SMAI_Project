<p>I am using PyDev in Eclipse to build a project. I have 2 sub-folders under my main <code>project</code> folder: <code>src</code> contains the main files and <code>conf</code> contains modules under my main project folder.</p>  <p>I have created a file called <code>variables.py</code> under <code>conf</code> folder and I have declared a variable <code>TOP</code> inside which is a directory path (/home/project/). I want to export this variable so that I can use it in other modules. I have created an <code>__init__.py</code> file in the <code>conf</code> folder.</p>  <p>I reference these from the <code>main</code> file under the <code>src</code> folder. </p>  <p>The main file will be as follows: </p>  <pre><code>import os  import sys  from subprocess import call  sys.path.append('/home/project/conf')  from variables import *  **os.chdir(TOP)**  print ("PWD is : %s" %os.getcwd()) </code></pre>  <p>Under <code>Variables</code> module in "conf" folder, I have defined </p>  <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python'  TOP="/home/project" </code></pre>  <p>Currently I am defining the variable <code>TOP</code> in my main file only. I want to define it in variables.py file and reference it from my main file.</p>  <ol> <li><p>However, I am unable to run as I get an error "Undefined variable TOP" in my main script. Note that <code>TOP</code> has been declared in the variables module under conf folder. I want to reference the variable TOP from my main file.</p></li> <li><p>If I want to navigate from the TOP directory to sub-directories when I am using <code>call</code> submodule, what should the syntax be?</p>  <pre><code>call (["$TOP/conf/boost_library.py"]) doesn't work, but  call (["/home/project/conf/boost_library.py"]) works. </code></pre></li> </ol>
