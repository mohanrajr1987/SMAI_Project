<p>I am writing a Python script that enumerates all processes running on the computer. My current code does this but prints this out in a large block of text that is hard to read. How can I improve my script to have the output text in a vertical list for each process and all?</p>  <pre><code>import subprocess print(subprocess.check_output('set',shell=True) </code></pre>  <p>*Edit: Here is the output text from the above script <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/cKx3N.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/cKx3N.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
