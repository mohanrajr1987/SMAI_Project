<p>I have a function which gives me a system as an output. The system composed of box of molecules. The input and output of the function is same. The work flow of the function is something like that given in function below. It picks a random molecule of (a) type from the system and replace with (b) type molecule and check if the energy is less or not. If the condition is satisfied then it return system containing (b) type molecule otherwise reverse the process and give me original system again. I would like to run the function certain number of times so it keep swapping a and b type molecules to lower the energy of the system. </p>  <pre><code>def func(system):     pick_any_molecule_b(directory_route)     system.remove(molecule_a)     system.add(molecule_b)     check_energy(system)     return system </code></pre>
