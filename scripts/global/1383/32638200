<p>I am receiving the following error when trying to load a PNG (over https) into an iframe on Amazon's mechanical turk:</p>  <pre><code>SEC7117: Network request to https://toucan.cs.colostate.edu/pp/images/125.png did not succeed. This Internet Explorer instance does not have the following capabilities: privateNetworkClientServer  </code></pre>  <p>You can view the page here <a href="https://workersandbox.mturk.com/mturk/preview?groupId=36TBNKR908TLAX7SKNTTRWW7TFYEDT" rel="nofollow">https://workersandbox.mturk.com/mturk/preview?groupId=36TBNKR908TLAX7SKNTTRWW7TFYEDT</a> It works fine in all other browsers.</p>  <p>I can't for the life of me figure out why Edge would be blocking PNG files (JS I can understand) and how to remedy it. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.</p>  <p><strong>More Info</strong><br/> Windows 10 64bit<br/> Edge 20.10240.16384.0<br/> Have tested on several machines and been able to replicate the problem<br/> Have admin rights on all machines and they are not part of a domain.</p>  <p><strong>Update</strong><br /> It seems to be an issue with the web server that is hosting the image which is running Apache. I placed the image on another apache server and everything worked fine. so then I tried to send the CORS header for all images as explained on <a href="https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-apache/blob/fc379c45f52a09dd41279dbf4e60ae281110a5b0/src/.htaccess#L36-L53" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-apache/blob/fc379c45f52a09dd41279dbf4e60ae281110a5b0/src/.htaccess#L36-L53</a> but that still didn't solve the problem. For some reason Edge blocks the request. </p>
