<p>I'm currently building a site in app engine that uploads images to google cloud storage and to complete basic manipulations I'm using python's PIL</p>  <p>I've been having problems with the following image which another stackoverflow member has mentioned is a palette-based PNG with transparency, which I've been reading may be a bit buggy in PIL</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/4GaDr.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/4GaDr.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>My question is really a back to basics one: What is the best way to convert this to an RGB format with transparent pixels set to #FFF? I've been able to get it to work through a combined RGBA then RGB paste but that seems redundant</p>  <p>However, for a direct conversion I'm getting a bad transparency mask i.e. using the solution from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7911451/pil-convert-png-or-gif-with-transparency-to-jpg-without">PIL Convert PNG or GIF with Transparency to JPG without</a></p>  <p>Also if anybody has ideas why the image degrades to terrible quality after conversion, that's entirely a bonus for me!</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/HcjPV.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/HcjPV.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
