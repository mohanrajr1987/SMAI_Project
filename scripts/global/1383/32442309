<p>On: Creating small image file png's showing tabular data</p>  <p>We sometimes need to show data online. There are a couple of popular ways of doing this: </p>  <ol> <li>HTML table</li> <li>JSON/Xml or other and using some method to display</li> <li>Creating an image</li> </ol>  <p>In this case we need to (or prefer to) create PNG images. The method we use now is to create it in Excel and export it to PNG. </p>  <p>The problem is that we have seen is that these images are not really optimized. And don't look nice when zoomed in. Or on different displays. </p>  <p><strong>Question:</strong> now what would be the best way of exporting table/tabular data from program X where we can store it (like Excel) to a clean and neat image format lik epNG that is safe for the web?</p>  <p>Advice and ideas appreciated</p>
