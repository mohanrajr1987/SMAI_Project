<p>Adobe Fireworks uses a multi-image PNG format that looks like APNG, but unfortunately is some weird proprietary format.</p>  <p>I work on Linux (Xubuntu), so I can't install Fireworks. I need a way to open such files and at least be able to extract them as regular PNG files, while keeping the layers. I found some Linux tools for APNG (obviously they don't work) but none for the Fireworks PNG format.</p>  <p>I know I can run Windows in a VM and install Fireworks, but it's overkill. I will only do this as a last resort.</p>  <p>Any ideas ?</p>  <p>EDIT : the image below is a Fireworks PNG. Your browser will most likely treat it as a regular PNG and display only picture 1 flatened (hand-drawn curvy stuff on a white background). If you download it and open it with Fireworks, you can see it actually contains 2 pictures, with two layers each.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/2HrBR.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/2HrBR.png" alt="PNG example"></a></p>
