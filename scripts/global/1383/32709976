<p>I'm learning Image Processing and would like to read raw data stored in PNG image. First I used the pyPNG libraries and made a bumpy array representing pixel data. But now I'm going to check if the values are exactly same with what you expect, in other words I want to make sure if the library can read 16bits PNG without any issues. </p>  <p>As a first step, I generated a PNG file having 4 pixels and their values are all </p>  <blockquote>   <ol>   <li>I used the array [[1, 1], [1,1]]. Now when I examine the PNG file by using the PyPNG. IT shows the followings. </li>   </ol>      <p>(2, 2, , {'bitdepth': 8,   'interlace': 0, 'planes': 1, 'greyscale': True, 'alpha': False,   'size': (2, 2)})</p> </blockquote>  <p>Next, I opened the PNG file in binary to hex converter.(<a href="http://www.fileformat.info/tool/hexdump.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fileformat.info/tool/hexdump.htm</a>)  And it shows. They are all the png file has.  </p>  <pre><code>    89 50 4e 47 0d 0a 1a 0a 00 00 00 0d 49 48 44 52     00 00 00 02 00 00 00 02 08 00 00 00 00 57 dd 52     f8 00 00 00 0e 49 44 41 54 78 9c 63 60 64 64 60     64 04 00 00 12 00 05 55 19 c1 2c 00 00 00 00 49     45 4e 44 ae 42 60 82 </code></pre>  <p>I understand some of them. But now all. Would anyone please explain the things I couldn't understand? </p>  <blockquote>   <p>(1) 89 50 4e 47-0d 0a 1a 0a means 'this is a png file' </p>      <p>(2) 00 00 00 0d is the length of header</p>      <p>(3) 49 48 44 52 is the type of header (IHDR) </p>      <p>(4) 00 00 00 02 width (2)</p>      <p>(5) 00 00 00 02 height (2)</p>      <p>(6) 08 is bitdepth (8-bits)</p>      <p>(7) 00 is colormap (grayscale)</p>      <p>(8) 00 is filter (no filter is used)</p>      <p>(9) 00 is interlace (no interlace is used)</p> </blockquote>  <p>But what are the next numbers? Where are the image data? After the 49 44 41 54(IDAT) there is no sequence of '1' that is expected for 4 pixels. Could anyone please explain the numbers? </p>  <p>I don't want to display the png file by using some application. I strongly need to understand the PNG format. Any help will be appreciated. </p>
