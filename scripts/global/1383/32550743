<p>I'm trying to download pdf/jpg/jpeg/png using PHP. Here is my code</p>  <pre><code>$result= mysqli_query("SELECT * FROM upload WHERE upload_id='$id'"); $row = mysqli_fetch_array($result);  //get file extension $filename = $row['upload_name']; $ext = pathinfo($filename, PATHINFO_EXTENSION);  if($ext=='jpg'||$ext=='jpeg'||$ext=='png' ||$ext=='pdf'){ echo "&lt;a href=\"download.php?id={$row['upload_name']} \"&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt;"; } </code></pre>  <p>download.php</p>  <pre><code>$name= $_GET['id'];  header('Content-Description: File Transfer'); header('Content-Type: application/force-download'); header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"" . basename($name) . "\";"); header('Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary'); header('Expires: 0'); header('Cache-Control: must-revalidate'); header('Pragma: public'); header('Content-Length: ' . filesize($name)); ob_clean(); flush(); readfile("uploads/".$name); //showing the path to the server where the file is to be download exit; </code></pre>  <p>When I tried the above code, it can be download however, when I tried opening the pdf/jpg/png it says invalid. Is there anything wrong with my code? This is my first time using the download code. So I really dont know what is the problem. </p>  <p>And for this path as stated in the code below,</p>  <pre><code>readfile("uploads/".$name); </code></pre>  <p>How do I write it if my pdf/jpg/png files are saved here in my computer C:\Apache2.2\htdocs\epals\uploads</p>  <p>Please help thanks</p>
