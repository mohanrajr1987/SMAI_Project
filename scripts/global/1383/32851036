<p>I am not sure what I am exactly doing here so please give some advise and forgive the mistakes.</p>  <p>I have a image <code>byte[]</code> called <code>idCardImage</code> and I did the following to convert it to a String:</p>  <pre><code>String s = new String(idCardImage); </code></pre>  <p>And it prints out like this:</p>  <pre><code>data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAUCAYAAACNiR0NAAAEHUlEQVQ4TzWUW49VRRCFv6rq3ufMmTNn.... </code></pre>  <p>Did some search online and it seems this image is in a <code>png</code> format with base 64 encoded. </p>  <p>What I need to do is to convert it to a <code>jpeg</code> format and then store it in a new  byte array. Can you give some advise on how to do it with Java?</p>
