<p>I have created an embedding system for the charts that are displayed on my website, and I want to let the user download the same charts as PNG-files.</p>  <p>In other words, I could use something as Phantom JS to do this server-side, but I wanted to know if there were an easier solution, since all I really want is to specify the width and height of the iframe, load the element, "screenshot" it and download.</p>  <p>So my question is: Is there any way to use javascript to render an iframe-element in the background and then download the rendered iframe as a PNG-file?</p>
