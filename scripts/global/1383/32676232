<p>I need to add some metadata to a lot of images. For example I need to add the position of the right eye and left eye to the metadata. That is righteye(291,493), lefteye(453,491) like that. I am working with png files now. Example with gimp is given bleow.  <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/wT9qW.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/wT9qW.png" alt="enter image description here"></a> Is there any good way to add these information to image metadata? I have seen <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/#11keywords" rel="nofollow">keywords and strings in png</a> file. Is that the solution to my problem? Also I need a tool to edit the metadata. I have a lot of facial images, and I need a tool to add these metadata to each image. And also I need to retrieve these data from each image programmatically. Please suggest a proper way to solve all these tasks. </p>
