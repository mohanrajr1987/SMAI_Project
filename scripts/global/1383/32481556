<p>I'm trying to modify the LSB in Pixels in order to Store Information in a Picture. The Encoding and Decoding does work how ever when i store the Bitmap to a png file which should be lossless and reload it the Pixel values have changed. This ofcourse leads to wrong values when i put the character back to gether however most of the times this can be fixed by substracting 136 from the Byte before making a char out of it. The Problem has to be the storing and reloading as when i pass the Bitmap directly to the Decoder everything works fine. </p>
