<p>I am currently working on an indoor positioning app. I am trying to load a 96K png file as an imageview, however this results in an out of memory error.</p>  <p>I have seen similar questions in the forum, however I cannot scale/resize the image as the image being used is a floorplan...hence changing scales is not appropriate, i.e. when measuring real life distances using the floor plan image.</p>  <p>Is there a way to efficiently load this png image?</p>
