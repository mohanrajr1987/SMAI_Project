<p>So I have the image of a map. And I have an image of an overlay which I want to place over the map such that you can see the map primarily but also the overlay. However on a pixel by pixel basis, I do not know how to evaluate the color of the resultant picture for it to be a mix of both the map and the overlay. For explanation purposes I made the following image:  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/gZJvrwf.png" alt="sample image"></p>  <p>You can see The carrots mainly, but you can also see Donald Trump over top of the carrots. So given the RGB values (or HSV, whichever one is more useful) of each individual pixel of the whole image, how would I combine them in such a way that I can see both?</p>
