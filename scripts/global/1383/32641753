<p>I have just noticed that TImageList in delphi (I have xe2 and xe8) draws PNG images wrong. At the screenshot you can see that reflection and edges look different (on the left is a TImage that shows my PNG correctly). ColorDepth is cd32Bit. I tried different PNGs with same result. Please advise a solution.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/TzEqw.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/TzEqw.png" alt="imagelist"></a></p>
