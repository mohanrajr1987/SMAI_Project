<p>I'm currently running into a very odd issue with fpdf. I found a similar question with no answer: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25980078/not-a-png-file-in-fpdf">not a PNG file in FPDF</a>. I have an image uploaded through a browser to my file server, and then pulled into a fpdf report. When this image is a png, I get the error: "FPDF error: Not a PNG file". I don't get any errors when the uploaded image is a jpg. This issue seemingly appeared overnight a few weeks ago.</p>  <p>Even stranger, it's only happening with new png's being uploaded. There was a png in a report that was generating fine. When I downloaded that png from the system and re-uploaded it, the errors appeared again.</p>  <p>Here are some of the steps I've taken while attempting to troubleshoot the issue:</p>  <ol> <li>I've made sure the image is actually a png (through its properties).</li> <li><p>Nothing has changed with the way I've been saving the images, but here's the    code:</p>  <pre><code>$original = $time."_".$name."_o.".$extension; $thumbnail = $time."_".$name."_t.".$extension;   include('SimpleImage.php'); $image = new SimpleImage(); $image-&gt;load($_FILES['file']['tmp_name']); $image-&gt;save($A_path."images/".$original); $image-&gt;resizeToHeight(200); $image-&gt;save($A_path."images/thumbs/".$thumbnail); $photo = "images/".$original; $thumb = "images/thumbs/".$thumbnail; </code></pre></li> <li>I've checked to see if their were any changes to the PNG format or FPDF updates, with no luck.</li> <li>I've converted a jpg that works into a png through gimp.</li> <li>Converting a png to a jpg through gimp and then uploading the jpg to the system does not generate any errors.</li> </ol>  <p>WORKAROUND- I've gone ahead and converted png's to jpg's on save, rather than re-encoding the image. Thanks for the help.</p>
