<p>I'm trying to read a png image file written in 16-bit data type. The data should be converted to a numpy array. But I have no idea how to read the file in '16bit'. I tried with PIL and Scipy, but they converted the 16bit data to 8bit when they load it. Could anyone please let me know how to up out data from a 16-bit png file and convert it to numpy array without changing the datatype? </p>  <p>The following is the script I used. </p>  <pre><code>from scipy import misc import numpy as np from PIL import Image #make a png file     a = np.zeros((1304,960), dtype=np.uint16) a[:] = np.arange(960) misc.imsave('16bit.png',a)  #read the png file using scipy b = misc.imread('16bit.png') print "scipy:" ,b.dtype  #read the png file using PIL c = Image.open('16bit.png')    d = np.array(c) print "PIL:", d.dtype </code></pre>
