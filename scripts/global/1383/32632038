<p>I need to convert pdf-files into images with a script in C# for Unity. Ghostscript shouldn't be installed on disk to do this. I tried to include the ghostscript .dll and use it with a wrapper which uses the following functions:</p>  <pre><code>gsapi_new_instance gsapi_init_with_args gsapi_exit gsapi_delete_instance </code></pre>  <p>However, if I use the commands <code>-sDEVICE=png16m -sOutputFile=outputpath.png inputpath.pdf</code> as arguments, it is not working. The first page of the pdf file is created but the others are not. I used "-%d" in the outputpath, but it's not working either. e.g. C:\Example-%d.png</p>  <p>I am using Ghostscript version 9.16, Unity version 5.2.0f3 and Visual Studio 2015.</p>  <p>Can please anyone tell me, why the first image file is created and the others are not? Is there any simple alternative for using ghostscript to create multiple images from a pdf by using C#?</p>
