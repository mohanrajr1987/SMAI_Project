<p>I'm planning to make a colored overlay to put over a map of my city. However I want the overlay to only be semitransparent.</p>  <p>I know about rgba values and how the a value is what determines the transparency, but when working with the BufferedImage class, I can only assign one color to one pixel. Lets say you're given two images of the same size. How would I go about overlaying one over the other with the overlay having only half the opacity as the original image.</p>
