<p>When I built my app on Xcode 7.0 (7A220), I was using LaunchScreen.storyboard to support IOS9 new feature: Multitask. I set up a full screen Image.png in {Regular, Regular} size-classes, Everything works well in simulators, but wrong in Devices, such as iPad Air2 ,New iPad. It displayed a total Black Screen while Launching. However what i am very confused is that a good behavior will happen accidental, then goes wrong again.</p>
