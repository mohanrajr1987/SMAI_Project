<p>i need to print on paper some png files below their filename as text, in java. The doc style should follow this example:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ul5ql.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ul5ql.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>How can i achive this? Thanks in advance</p>  <p>EDIT: I have found this nice "IText" guide, and seems exactly what i was looking for. It's just for creating pdf, so it won't sent nothing to the printer, but can resolve my problem in a nice way. I'll give it a try tomorrow <a href="http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-itext/index.html" rel="nofollow">IText Guide</a></p>
