<p>I have a <code>Theano</code> code which is using batches of data. When I am increasing the batch size, it is throwing me the SegFault error. It is working perfectly fine upto <code>batch size = 750</code>. But <code>increasing</code> it to <code>1000</code> is throwing me error. I also checked that it is using only <code>50MB of GPU memory</code> at any time. But I have <code>128MB GPU memory</code> on my system. Can anyone help me here to debug the issue.</p>
