<p>I wanted to check something about access violation so I wrote down this code:</p>  <pre><code>int a[] = {1,2,3}; for(int i=0; i &lt; 20000; i++) {     cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; ": " &lt;&lt; a[i] &lt;&lt; endl; } </code></pre>  <p>It crashes, as it should.</p>  <p>Now, this code should segfault because 20000 is too high and I getting beyond my address space, correct?</p>  <p>What I don't get is why it segfaults on different <code>i</code>. Each time I run this code I get segfault on different location. Is that because my array was allocated in a different place on the stack and got more or less address space than before?</p>
