<p>Here is a code to insert a data in a binary trie. This code works perfectly if I compile it with a basic gcc main.c -o main . </p>  <pre><code>/**      * Insert a new gateway in the tree, at the position corresponding to the      * subnet address.      *      * addr    : Subnet address      * netmask : Subnet mask      * gw      : gateway identifier      *       * return  : void.      */     void insertMyAlgo(unsigned int addr, unsigned int netmask, unsigned int gw)     {        struct node* noeud;        int i;        int maskBit = countMaskBit(netmask);         // Going down in the tree until next mask bit = 0.        noeud = arbre;        for (i = 31; i &gt; 31 - maskBit; i--)        {           // Bit = 1, go down in the right child.           if ((addr &gt;&gt; i) &amp; 0x1)           {              if (noeud-&gt;fd == NULL)                 noeud-&gt;fd = allocNode();              noeud = noeud-&gt;fd;           }            // Bit = 0, go down in the left child.           else           {              if (noeud-&gt;fg == NULL)                 noeud-&gt;fg = allocNode();              noeud = noeud-&gt;fg;           }        }         // Insert the gateway in the node corresponding to our subnet address.        noeud-&gt;gateway = gw;     } </code></pre>  <p>I would like to use the -O option to optimize time spent in looking up the tree, finding a specific key. I get a segfault when I execute my main with this -O options.  Gdb gave me the following informations : </p>  <pre><code>Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault. insertMyAlgo (addr=12288, netmask=&lt;optimized out&gt;, gw=3238068734)     at mainbinaireBench.c:125 125            if (noeud-&gt;fg == NULL) (gdb) print noeud-&gt;fg Cannot access memory at address 0x8 </code></pre>  <p>So the error seems to be here : </p>  <pre><code> // Bit = 0, go down in the left child.  else  {     if (noeud-&gt;fg == NULL)        noeud-&gt;fg = allocNode();     noeud = noeud-&gt;fg;  } </code></pre>  <p>I really don't know why there is this error, and why the program works without this -O option. I would really like to make it works, if some of you guys could help me to understand, it would be very nice. </p>  <p>Thank you !</p>
