<p>We are trying to deploy the code using Jenkins to our QA and our maven goals include <code>-P analysis</code> in it which is used to find the check style errors.</p>  <p>Now, my problem is we got lot of check style errors and we need to push the code into QA immediately. </p>  <p>Can we build the Jenkins by removing <code>-P analysis</code> in the goals which ignores the check style errors? can we ignore the check style errors and push the code? Will cause any problems in the future?</p>  <p>Please suggest me the correct method.</p>  <p>Thanks! </p>
