<p>I have been writing code in node.js now for sometime, and node has this nice package manager called <code>npm</code> To install a package, I simple do <code>npm install pkg-name</code> and there it is, in my <code>node_modules</code> folder. There is a <code>package.json</code> file with all my dependencies listed. </p>  <p>I need to write some Java code and Maven seems to be a popular dependency management tool for Java. Although, I had a bit of a tough time wrapping my head around it.</p>  <p><em>I want to know what are the analogous things in <code>Maven</code> to <code>npm</code>.</em></p>  <p>So, what's the equivalent to <code>npm install pkg-name</code> in Maven? Where do I find the dependencies? <code>npm</code> has a nice web ui, something like that for Maven?</p>  <p>Any hello world projects for Maven that I can see?</p>
