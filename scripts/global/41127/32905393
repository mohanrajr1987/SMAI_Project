<p>I have the following problem while trying to execute the compile goal on an Eclipse Java project with Maven:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-compiler-plugin:3.1:compile (default-compile) on project ...: Compilation failure</p>      <p>[ERROR] multi-catch statement is not supported in -source 1.5</p>      <p>[ERROR] (use -source 7 or higher to enable multi-catch statement)</p> </blockquote>  <p>The JDK in the Eclipse project is configured to use version 1.8.0_60.</p>  <p>The compiler compliance level is also set to 1.8: <a href="http://imgur.com/4AvjZd6" rel="nofollow">http://imgur.com/4AvjZd6</a></p>  <p>However, the settings above are related to the Eclipse project configuration and not to Maven settings.</p>  <p>In Window -> Preferences, I have seen the compiler plugin is also set to 1.8: <a href="http://imgur.com/BpNANqZ" rel="nofollow">http://imgur.com/BpNANqZ</a></p>  <p>The question is: how to I tell Maven to use source 1.7 (or above)?</p>
