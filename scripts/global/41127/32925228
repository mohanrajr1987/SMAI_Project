Its stuck at 0%. </p>  <p>No Proxy.<br> Happening in Windows 10 and Ubuntu both.   </p>  <p>Could someone help me resolve this?    </p>  <p>(I had raised <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32862454/eclipse-mars-download-repository-index-updates-on-startup-fails">another query</a> where similar issue happens behind company proxy but not sure if they are related.)</p>
