<p>I do not manage to create a proper service.xml into my portlet application to use service builder.</p>  <p>1) Firstly, if I try to use Eclipse IDE: - right click on project - liferay service builder Plugin project select box is empty and I cannot click finish. I get an "Enter a project name" notification.</p>  <p>2) If I try to manually create a service.xml file into WEB-INF/ or WEB-INF/src with this content:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE service-builder PUBLIC "-//Liferay//DTD Service Builder 6.2.0//EN" "http://www.liferay.com/dtd/liferay-service-builder_6_0_0.dtd"&gt;  &lt;service-builder package-path="com.aveo.openemm.servicebuilder"&gt;,  &lt;/service-builder&gt; </code></pre>  <p>the file is just a regular xml file and does not act as a service builder file. Opening it in Eclipse does not offer an"overview" mode, which would allow me to create and manage my entities as expected.</p>  <p>The project was built with Maven (in case it makes a difference).</p>  <p>I ve no clue how to move forward at this stage. Thx for your kind assistance.</p>
