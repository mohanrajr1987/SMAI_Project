<p>I was asked to use Gradle in several projects and create a remote repository of various jar files that might be needed by the projects.  I am new to Gradle but just defining the library dependencies does not seem something difficult. Now regarding the repository I would like to use Bitbucket as host of a Maven repository, following this guide <a href="https://bitbucket.org/neil_rubens/rapidminer_maven-repo/wiki/Home" rel="nofollow">rapidminer_maven-repo Wiki</a>.  As I have not experience with Maven and I have spent too much time with this guide, could someone explane the steps in more detail to set this up?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
