<p>I have a multi-module maven project which seems to have correctly generated OWASP dependency reports at both the parent and child module /target dirs using the org.owasp:dependency-check-maven plugin as so:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/DoQwh.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/DoQwh.png" alt="dependency-check-report generation"></a></p>  <p>However, referencing the plugin <a href="https://github.com/stevespringett/dependency-check-sonar-plugin" rel="nofollow">docs</a>, and executing the sonar-maven-plugin as below, I just can't work out what the correct command should be, any combination seems to lead to a build failure:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>mvn sonar:sonar -Dsonar.sources=? -Dsonar.dependencyCheck.reportPath=?</p> </blockquote>  <p>Can anyone explain how to configure a multi-module maven project and have Sonar recognise the OWASP dependency reports?</p>  <p>Below is a screenshot of the starting point - we've had a CI pipeline up and running producing separate unit and integration test coverage stats for each of the submodules for some time. </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/wmFPW.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/wmFPW.png" alt="current sonar view"></a> </p>
