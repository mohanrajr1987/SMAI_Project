<p>My application stack is Spring web mvc, spring data-mongodb as odm. in mongoConfiguration if i am giving mongodb host`s public ip then my IDE (intelij) is creating war file successfully, as that public host is reachable from my local laptop,  But if i am giving a private ip of mongodb server (as that private ip will be accessible from the production server) then it is showing error while creating war file.  it is giving following error - </p>  <pre><code>Caused by: com.mongodb.MongoTimeoutException: Timed out after 10000 ms while waiting for a server that matches AnyServerSelector{}. Client view of cluster state is {type=Unknown, servers=[{address=10.71.142.162:27018, type=Unknown, state=Connecting}] </code></pre>  <p>So my question is, why it is attempting to connect while creating war file?</p>
