<p>I've installed Xubuntu 15.04 on separate ext4 partition, I already have Xubuntu 14.10 on other ext4.</p>  <p>I logged into 15.04, trying to run 'mvn clean install' on project, which copied from 14.10 (or git pull whatever). We using mockito 1.9.0, and in some tests with mocks I got java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class com.some.MockedClass$$EnhancerByMockitoWithCGLIB. If I run this test only it pass.</p>  <p>If I navigate to folder on 14.10 and run it here build is successful. If I copied project from 15.04 to 14.10 it working normal there as well. </p>  <p>I have used java7/8 maven 3.0.6/3.3.3. I am owner of the folder and all content. Also I've tried to copy .m2, tried to use chmod 777 at all.</p>
