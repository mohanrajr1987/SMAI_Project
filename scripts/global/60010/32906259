<p>I'm still fairly new to Python and I just don't get what's wrong here.</p>  <p>I get an <code>IndexError: list index out of range</code> in the middle of reading lines from a CSV file. The file has ~135k lines of data. After the code has processed line 38.715 I receive aforementioned error for the code line with the <code>print</code> function. I don't get what is causing this, as there are no problems with any lines before that one, and the structure or type of the data doesn't change. I'm running Ubuntu 14.04 (64 bit) in VMware btw.</p>  <p>Note: the <code>str(int(row[2]))</code> is just to remove preceding 0's so I can compare the string to another string afterwards. </p>  <p>This is my code:</p>  <pre><code>import csv with open('/home/joakim/Desktop/SomeFile.csv', 'r') as f_id:     f_reader = csv.reader(f_id, delimiter=';')     for row in f_reader:         print ('C.id:', row[0], 'PR.id:', row[1], 'Id:', str(int(row[2]))) </code></pre>  <p>Can anyone point me in any direction?</p>
