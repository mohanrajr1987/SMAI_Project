<p>I just began learning Python to help me create a little UI to manage my windows clients on my renderfarm. Here is an example of my problem : </p>  <pre><code>import tkinter as tk  #my variable : number of clients specified by the user NUMCLIENTS = 10  class APP(tk.Tk):     def __init__(self):         tk.Tk.__init__(self)          for i in range (0,NUMCLIENTS):             i = i+1              #name buttons, commands and texts             button = ("b",i,"_01")             CMD = ("command"+str(i))             RN = ("RN0"+str(i))              #create buttons on grid with text             self.button = tk.Button(self, text= RN, command = self.CMD)             self.button.grid(row=i, column=0, sticky="s, n, e, w")      #the command I want to duplicate for each button     def CMD (self):         #print the button name         print (RN)           app = APP() app.mainloop() </code></pre>  <p>I need to create as many rows as I have clients (specified in the variable "NUMCLIENTS") and associate a specific command for each one of them, like : </p>  <pre><code>button1 pressed =&gt; print text "RN01" button2 pressed =&gt; print text "RN02" </code></pre>  <p>... etc.</p>  <p>I don't how to loop my command like I looped the button and associate the both. I saw somewhere there might be a "late binding" problem with looping functions. I tried using lists but never succeed.</p>  <p>I hope you can help me with that.</p>  <p>Thanks for your help and your patience.</p>
