<p>It's not a real problem in practice, since I can just write <code>BOM = "\uFFFE"</code>; but it bugs me that I have to hand-code such a basic thing as a magic constant. Surely python defines it in a handy form somewhere? </p>  <p>Searching turned up a series of constants in the <code>codecs</code> module: <code>codecs.BOM</code>, <code>codecs.BOM_UTF8</code>, and so on. But these are <code>bytes</code> objects, not strings. Where is the real BOM?</p>  <p>This is for python 3, but I would be interested in the Python 2 situation for completeness. </p>
