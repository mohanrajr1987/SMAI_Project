<p>I have two files: one is a list of terms, and the other is a text file. I want to print the text file without the terms present in the first file.</p>  <p>I tried this:</p>  <pre><code>import codecs   import ast list_file = codecs.open(list_file).read() text_file = codecs.open(text_file).read() import ast li = ast.literal_eval(list_file) for l in li:     print(text_file.replace((l, "")) </code></pre>  <p>The problem here is the iteration. Can someone help?</p>
