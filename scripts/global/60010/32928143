<p>My code is meant to ask a user to pick which household animal that is preferred. The answer should be either <em>"cats"</em> or <em>"dogs"</em>.</p>  <pre><code>household_animal = (input("Which household animal do you prefer?")) if household_animal in ("cat", "dog"):     print("Thanks for your input on which household animal you prefer!") else:     print("This is not a household animal, please pick again.") </code></pre>  <p>I am uncertain about how to make the program continue to ask for input until the user picks either <em>"cat"</em> or <em>"dog"</em>. If correct input is detected, it should no longer ask for more input.</p>  <p>How do I solve this?</p>
