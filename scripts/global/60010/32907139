<p>Assume c is given. Find up to 2 unique solutions a, b such that  a^3+b^3=c^3. </p>  <p>My solution: </p>  <pre><code>c=int(input("Choose c", )) k=(c-1)**(1/3) counter=0 a=1 while a&lt;k:     a+=1     b=int((c-a**3)**(1/3))     if a**3+b**3==c and a&gt;b:         counter+=1         print(a,b)     if counter==2:         break         print(a,b) </code></pre>  <p>Explanation:</p>  <p>1: First we choose an integer c.</p>  <p>2: k is the upper limit a.</p>  <p>3: I want a counter so that I can get 2 different solutions.</p>  <p>4: a should begin from 1.</p>  <p>5: This is to test every integer from 1 to k.</p>  <p>6: a should increase with 1 when the "if" isn't satisfied.</p>  <p>7: Defining b.</p>  <p>8: This is the equation we want solved. </p>  <p>9: So if the equation is solved then we add 1 to the counter.</p>  <p>10: We also print a and b. </p>  <p>11-13: This is to make sure we stop when we get the second solution. </p>  <p><strong>PROBLEM!</strong> If I put in c=1729 it only returns (12,1). Why won't it continue to search for more solutions? </p>
