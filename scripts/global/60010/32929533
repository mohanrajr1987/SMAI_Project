<p>so this is my code, the purpose of this code is to ask the user to input an value: 1,2 or 3, if the user enter something else, it will shows "invalid input" when the user put 1,2 or 3, it will counts from 0 to the value that the user puts.     </p>  <pre><code>def c():     while True:         i = input("Give me one of 1,2 or 3: ")         if len(i)==1 and i&gt;="1"and i&lt;="3":            return int(i)         else:            print("invalid input!")         for i in range(i+1):            print(i) c() </code></pre>  <p>everything works fine until the for loop, i am new learner in python and i have no idea on how to fix it.</p>
