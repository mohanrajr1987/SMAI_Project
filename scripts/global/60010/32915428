<p>I need to code a vending machine, that only accepts certain coins</p>  <blockquote>   <p>"It will allow you to input 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p and £1.00 but it will REJECT a £2.00 coin"</p> </blockquote>  <p>I have a list, with float values inside: </p>  <pre><code>coins = ["0.01","0.02","0.05","0.10","0.20","0.50","1"] </code></pre>  <p>These are the coins, that I am wanting the user to enter into </p>  <pre><code>coin = float(input()) </code></pre>  <p>And after this I have</p>  <pre><code>def balance():      coin = float(input("Please enter your coins."))      if coin not in coins:             print("Incorrect coin amount! Please remember we don't accept 2 pound coins!")       else:         print("Correct coin amount. The coins have been added to your balance")         fb = fb + coin </code></pre>  <p>I couldn't get this to work, as it would just print "Incorrect coin amount! Please remember we don't accept 2 pound coins!". After this, I tried this solution already on here: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23091208/python-coding-vending-machine-how-to-get-the-user-to-only-enter-certain-coin/23091227#23091227">Python Coding - Vending machine - How to get the user to only enter certain coins?</a> I thought this meant I needed to change my float(input()) and everything float to int, so changing 0.01 (1p) to 1. But, when I did, I stil got</p>  <pre><code>'int' object has no attribute 'split' </code></pre>  <p>When using it in this code</p>  <pre><code>dict = {"KitKat":"80p", "Coca-Cola":"85p", "DairyMilk":"80p","Walkers Crisps":"90p"} coins = ["1","2","5","10","20","50","100"]  def balance():     inp = int(input("Please enter your coins. Please enter in pence, for example 1 pound = 100"))     if any(int(coin) not in value for coin in inp.split()):         print("Machine doesn't accept these coins")   else:     print("Correct coin amount. The coins have been added to your balance")     fb = fb + coin   def items():     print (" 1. KitKat:" , dict['KitKat'])     print (" 2. Coca-Cola:", dict['Coca-Cola'])     print (" 3. Dairy Milk:", dict["DairyMilk"])     print (" 4. Walkers Crisps:", dict["Walkers Crisps"]) snack = 1 # need a while loop, ignore fb = 0.00 balance() print("Your full balance is",fb) </code></pre>
