<p>How do i increment numbers in a python list such that only the current minimums in that list are updated. For example:</p>  <pre><code>a = [15,15,14,12,10,10,10] </code></pre>  <p>I have a number <code>x=12</code> I need to optimally allocate it to this array such that the maximal is minimum, ie, first I give 2,2,2 to each 10 then 2,2,2 to any 3 12s. And my final list looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>a = [15,15,14,14,14,14,12] </code></pre>
