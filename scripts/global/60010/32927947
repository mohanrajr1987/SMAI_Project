<p>I am very new to python, going through a guide and was wondering when you state the following... (see below) What are the differences? There seems to be a pattern here that maybe I'm not catching on and the more I push thru the guide the more this question pops up in my head :)</p>  <pre><code>print(' ') print(" ") print(   )  find(' ') find(" ") find(   )  urlopen(' ') urlopen(" ") urlopen(   ) </code></pre>
