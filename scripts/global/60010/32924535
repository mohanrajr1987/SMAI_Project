<p>I looked around on <a href="https://duckduckgo.com" rel="nofollow">DuckDuckGo</a> but only find very complex examples and packages about that.</p>  <p>I simply want to store a picture (would prefere PNG) in a table accessing this with SQLAlchemy on Python3. I don't want to query on the picture. I just want to show the picture in a GUI. e.g. imagine a picture of a person in a <code>Person</code> table.</p>  <p>I think here are two sub-tasks.</p>  <ol> <li>Storing it in SQLAlchemy. Which Column-type?</li> <li>Using the data with kind of a png-python-package to show it.</li> </ol>  <p>wxPython over the plattform-independend image format <a href="http://wxpython.org/Phoenix/docs/html/Image.html" rel="nofollow">wxImage</a>. But I am not sure if this would be the right thing to store in a database.</p>
