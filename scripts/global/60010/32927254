<p>I'm trying to validate an input by using a list that holds the strings that are valid inputs but I can't seem to get it to work correctly, any help?</p>  <pre><code>choice = ["A","a","B","b"] def main():     test = input()     if validate(test):         print("Entered a")     else:         print("did not enter a")  def validate(val):     try:          val = choice.index[1]     except:         return False     else:         return True main() </code></pre>
