<p>I'm running a large number of OCRs on screenshots with Pytesseract. This is working well in most cases, but a small number is causing this error:</p>  <pre><code>pytesseract.image_to_string(image,None, False, "-psm 6") Pytesseract: UnicodeDecodeError: 'charmap' codec can't decode byte 0x9d in position 2: character maps to &lt;undefined&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I'm using Python 3.4. Any suggestions how I can prevent this error from happening (other than just a try/except) would be very helpful.</p>
