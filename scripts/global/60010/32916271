<pre><code>from turtle import*  branch_width=4 grass_color=input("Would you like your grass to be snowy, dead, or healthy? ") sky_color=input("Would you like it to be morning, afternoon, or evening? ")  morning="cadetblue" afternoon="cornflowerblue" evening="royalblue" snowy="snow" dead="wheat" healthy="darkgreen" </code></pre>  <p>Every time I try to use the input as <code>color(sky_color)</code>, the user's input is not translated to <code>morning="cadetblue"</code>, etc, which returns an error. How do I fix this? Do I need to just make the user type in the color?</p>
