<p>I have this assignment i'm struggling with and I'm not sure what the result was suppose to be. all we had to do was to rearrange some of the code lines and give the result. and here is the code</p>  <pre><code>from random import randint  print("    Your lone hero is surrounded by a massive army of trolls.") print("Their decaying green bodies stretch out, melting into the horizon.") print("Your hero unsheathes his sword and begins the last fight of his life.\n")  health = 25 damage = randint(1, 10) trolls = 0  while health &gt; 0:     damage= randint(1, 10)     health = health - damage     trolls = trolls + 1     print("Your hero swings and defeats an evil troll. " \           "but takes", damage, "damage points.") print("Your hero fought valiantly and defeated", trolls, "trolls") print("But, alas, your hero is no more!") </code></pre>  <p>and the result from our class's results are always different from mine and the result was suppose to be like this. or something like this</p>  <p>Your lone hero is surrounded by a massive army of trolls.  Their decaying green bodies stretch out, melting into the horizon.  Your hero unsheathes his sword and begins the last fight of his life.</p>  <p>Your hero swings and defeats an evil troll. but takes 8 damage points.</p>  <p>Your hero swings and defeats an evil troll. but takes 3 damage points.</p>  <p>Your hero swings and defeats an evil troll. but takes 10 damage points.</p>  <p>Your hero swings and defeats an evil troll. but takes 9 damage points.</p>  <p>Your hero fought valiantly and defeated 4 trolls</p>  <p>But, alas, your hero is no more!</p>
