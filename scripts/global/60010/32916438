<p>Trying to get my head around programming, I cannot work out why this doesn't work? Am I using "not" and "in" incorrectly?</p>  <p>I am trying to get the program to only print the characters that appear in both the strings. It correctly identifies them, but I can't get it to only print one set of the characters if there is more than one occurrence.</p>  <pre><code>a = input("string1 :") b = input("string2: ") list1 = []  for i in a:     for j in b:         if i == j and i not in list1:             list1.append([i])             break  print(list1) </code></pre>  <p>For example if you print the strings "alexander" and "alex" it will print the characters a, l, e, x, a, e</p>  <p>I know this current method only works if string1 is inputted as the main string, but I am just interested as to why this doesn't work.</p>
