<p>I am trying to validate a TextArea{basically a Comments box} which would accept almost all characters and special characters with spaces included. The constraint is i only want to use JSF validateRegex tag. I do not want to use validator java class. IN my code i have done like below</p>  <pre><code>&lt;f:validateRegex pattern="^[a-zA-Z0-9\s_\s-.]*[@#$%!]*$"&gt; </code></pre>  <p>The textarea does not accept any string with '#,$,%,(),?,!' inspite of including in regex But it accepts only '@'. Can anyone help me out in creating a valid regular expression for this textarea field in JSF.</p>
