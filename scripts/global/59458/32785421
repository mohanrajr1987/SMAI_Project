<p>I am looking for a way to display a collection of data by column (instead of by row) in a jsf primefaces datatable component. For example, i have a bean named User and i want to display a list of User in a primefaces datatable : each User displayed in a separate column, each property (name, surname, ...) in a separate row. Do you know if it is possible with a datatable  ? Thanks for your answers.</p>
