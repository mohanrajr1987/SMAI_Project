<p>Hi i have a little problem with primefaces imageCrooper. My tag looks like:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;p:imageCropper     aspectRatio="1.0"    minSize="100,100"    initialCoords="20,20,20,20"    id="imageDialog"     value="#{registerForm.croppedImage}"     image="#{registerForm.uploadedFilename}"   /&gt; </code></pre>  <p>all cropping process works fine. But i have problem with default cropper area size on the start. When picture appear on the screen i dont see default size of cropper area (from property minSize=100,100). The cropper area appear only when user try to croop a some area of image (he start selecting area of picture) then a crooper area appear with minSize=100,100. But how to show user this area cropper on the start without start selecting process? </p>  <p>At this moment only way to show user a cropp area on the start is set minSize=100,100 and maxSize=100,100 but then my aspectRatio dont have a sense. I need functionality from aspectRatio throught cropp image.</p>  <p>I Would add here something else. initialCoords attribute dosent works for me too. maybe this is interrelated with each other</p>  <p>I Will greatfull for your help!</p>  <p>I use primefaces version via maven:</p>  <pre><code>    &lt;dependency&gt;         &lt;groupId&gt;org.primefaces&lt;/groupId&gt;         &lt;artifactId&gt;primefaces&lt;/artifactId&gt;         &lt;version&gt;5.2&lt;/version&gt;     &lt;/dependency&gt; </code></pre>
