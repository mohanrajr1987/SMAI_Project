<p>I need to add a Html content when some method returns the wanted result (any method, any result) to the JSF page exactly like primefaces do with .</p>  <p>Html to add is simple :</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div class="alert alert-success" role="alert"&gt;                     &lt;strong&gt;Well done!&lt;/strong&gt; You successfully read this important alert message.                 &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>But can't find a way to do this cleanly, I've read many posts like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2351639/how-do-i-return-html-from-managed-bean-in-jsf">How do I return HTML from managed bean in JSF?</a> but my bean need to insert that html when user is doing something e.g. submitting a form result.</p>  <p><strong>Also :</strong> is there a way to save it and show it in case of a redirection like it is with primefaces     <code>context.getExternalContext().getFlash().setKeepMessages(true);</code></p>
