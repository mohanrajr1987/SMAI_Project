<p>I am using primefaces collector and it works perfect to add or remove an element from a backing bean, but I donÂ´t know how can I modify an element of that collection because the collector tag only has the add and remove attributes. </p>  <p>Which is the best approach to do this?</p>  <p>I'm thinking in use a commandButton and pass the object as a parameter and then modify it in a dialog, but I'm not sure. Has someone have done this before?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
