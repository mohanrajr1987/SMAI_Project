<p>I have an h:form in my page and have another page embedded using ui:insert. Im using foundation 5 and my page has a modal. Now this modal opens as I click a button on the page. I fill the content in this modal and the values dont go across to the bean (session scoped cdi) unless I add h:form there in the modal. I understand this isnt valid in html, but I couldnt avoid doing this. So far no problems. Until now when I try to complete an action on the modal, after the action completes, it is supposed to close conditionally(if a certain list becomes empty). so I added a function in the onevent of ajax request, which closes the modal if data.status == "success", checks for list empty condition and escapes to the main page and clicks a tab as it should from the javascript. The problem is, the model values get updated, even the form components I render using render attribute of f:ajax, are updated, meaning display:none; is applied to my button's style, but the button remains on the page. This button is supposed to disappear, but it does not until I refresh the page. Also there are other components on the page which are supposed to disappear but dont until I click the button or refresh the page.</p>  <p>One other scenario is that as I finish a save function from this modal from a button, it escapes to the main page and updates a list and other components on the page, on my local server. But when I commited this code to remote server(dev/int env), things on the main page become unresponsive and freeze until a manual page refresh. No code difference between local and server.</p>  <p>Tried clearing browser cache,</p>  <ul> <li>  </li> </ul>  <p>But no use. I forced a form submit and button click through the javascript, which I shouldnt have to do, the form submit does it but I also do a click on a tab after that and that does not work.</p>  <p>I have looked for some solution on the web extensively but I cant seem to find any related post. Dont know what I am not doing. Any help will be much appreciated because right now Im superstuck here. </p>
