<p>I want to use STEAM-LOGIN in my JSF2 web application. I found this in Steam Web API documentation:</p>  <p>"Steam can act as an OpenID provider. This allows your application to authenticate a user's SteamID without requiring them to enter their Steam username or password on your site (which would be a violation of the API Terms of Use.) Just download an OpenID library for your language and platform of choice and use <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/openid" rel="nofollow">http://steamcommunity.com/openid</a> as the provider. The returned Claimed ID will contain the user's 64-bit SteamID. The Claimed ID format is: <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/openid/id/" rel="nofollow">http://steamcommunity.com/openid/id/</a>"</p>  <p>Here are my questions:</p>  <ul> <li>There are several OpenID libraries for Java, which one should I use?</li> <li>I have no idea how to implement redirection to Steam login page and back to my page</li> </ul>  <p>I found some examples for PHP but nothing for Java.</p>
