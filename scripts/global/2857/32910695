<p>I have a situation here: I have to export the content of a field in my database to a file. This table has like 78K rows, and each row will become a file (in a specific structure). Every file is "huge", like 100K or so.</p>  <p>I've made the following script to do so:</p>  <pre><code>$SC = new Table1(); $S = new DataRow(); $letters = $SC-&gt;getAllRows(); foreach ($letters as $i =&gt; $letter) {     $folder = "basefolder/;     $id_unique = $letter['id_unique'];     $letterData = $S-&gt;getLetterData($id_unique);     $date = explode("-",$letterData['date']);     $year = $date[0];     $id_client = $letterData['id_client'];     if(!file_exists( $folder )) mkdir( $folder, 0777 );     $folder .= $id_client."/";     if(!file_exists( $folder )) mkdir( $folder, 0777 );     $folder .= $year."/";     if(!file_exists( $folder )) mkdir( $folder, 0777 );     $folder .= $id_unique."/";     if(!file_exists( $folder )) mkdir( $folder, 0777 );     file_put_contents($folder.$letter['id_unique_letter'].".html",$letter['letter']); } echo "OK"; </code></pre>  <p>The main problem focuses on the moment when the files are created. When the script is running I see no files being created, only when it ends (with a test table of 20 rows) I see all the files created, but with my main table I have tried and the buffer fills before finish. I don't want to split the process in a number of executions with few rows each one. So, the main question is: How could I create the files at the moment I write them? It could be something related to my OS, as it's about files? </p>  <p>Thank you for all your help!!</p>
