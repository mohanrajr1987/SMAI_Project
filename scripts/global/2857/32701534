<p>We have an application that is using Zend Framework 1.  We have a known bug that sometimes causes PHP to run out of memory when trying to use the Zend_Json encoder.</p>  <p>What brings me here though is something else, we are also seeing in our logs a php fatal for Zend_Session::writeClose().</p>  <pre><code>Message: Access to undeclared static property: Zend_Session::$_unitTestEnabled File: /usr/local/zend/var/libraries/Zend_Framework_1/1.12.10/library/Zend/Session.php Line: 720 </code></pre>  <p><code>public static $_unitTestEnabled = false;</code> is declared at the beginning of the class.</p>  <p>In writeClose is a simple check of:</p>  <pre><code>if (self::$_unitTestEnabled) {     return; } </code></pre>  <p>Can an out of memory condition unset static properties? I'm trying to determine if this fatal is related to the known out of memory condition or if something else is wrong.</p>
