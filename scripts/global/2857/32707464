<p>i have been given a zend project to work on, when i do the usual composer.phar install/update the existing Z2F folder is unchanged, a new zendframework folder is created instead. I ask this question because I updated once after deleting libraries in ZF2 folder and they were reinstalled (in the ZF2 folder).</p>  <p>If this is the current default behaviour then all good, but i have a nagging feeling that i might not be updating correctly, and therefore not confident of the project behaviour.</p>  <p>Is installing directly into existing ZF2 folder now defunct??</p>
