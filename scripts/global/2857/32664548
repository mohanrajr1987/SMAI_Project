<p>I know there are various questions out there and various solutions on how to achieve this via .htaccess</p>  <p>The question is simple - when a user enters a url like</p>  <pre> www.abc.com/users/index/ </pre>  <p>It should appear as</p>  <pre> www.abc.com/users/index </pre>  <p>I read somewhere that using htaccess for this purpose is an overkill and it should be done in the predispatch or preprocess method in Zend.</p>  <p>I am not sure how that can be done.</p>  <p>Has anyone done this without using .htaccess</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
