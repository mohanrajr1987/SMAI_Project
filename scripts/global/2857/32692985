<p>I use zf2 and doctrine for launching my project. My cpu shows high usage on httpd requests. I enabled opcache for filecaching, and memcache for doctrine </p>  <p>So what is the reason for load average being near 5.0?  i  put die('test1') inside of  onBootstrap of zendframework2 one time and in another time put it die('test') before </p>  <pre><code>    die('test2') Zend\Mvc\Application::init(require 'config/application.config.php')-&gt;run(); </code></pre>  <p>my apache bench shows that when framework loaded without any connection to database or goes to any controller its 5x slower why zf2 is too heavy and what is the solution ?</p>
