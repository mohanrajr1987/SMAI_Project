<p>I was asked to create an API using the Laravel framework on an existing Web application. The web application uses the Zend 2 Block Cipher encryption to encrypt user password. The previous developer who developed the site has already moved on and I need to create a service to verify the user's password in the API. The problem is I can't crack Zend's encryption. I even tried using the PHP mcrypt function but I'm getting this error.</p>  <pre><code>mcrypt_decrypt(): Size of key is too large for this algorithm </code></pre>  <p>This is a bit odd but is there anyway I can decrypt Zend's encryption using just plain PHP? Or is there a work around here? I can't change the current web application as it is being used. </p>  <p>Here is the sample code of the encryption:</p>  <pre><code>use Zend\Crypt\BlockCipher;  class Encryption {     private $_cipher = null;      public function __construct(){         $this-&gt;_cipher = BlockCipher::factory('mcrypt',array('algo'=&gt;'aes'));         $this-&gt;_cipher-&gt;setKey('fltjXW05820D[1(Z5SknJBZ12goBbyK&lt;*271biqT5"j$WvA2JCycgA"{UIe6qJ2');     }      public function encrypt($plainText){         return $this-&gt;_cipher-&gt;encrypt($plainText);     }      public function decrypt($enctyptedData){         return $this-&gt;_cipher-&gt;decrypt($enctyptedData);     } } </code></pre>  <p>Any advice by the experts?</p>  <p>Thank you in advance. Sorry I'm a beginner in Laravel and Zend.</p>
