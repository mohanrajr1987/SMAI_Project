<p>I am using Zend F/W 1.12 in order to build a REST server. One of my requirements are to have an action that Is outside the boundaries of what Zend can recognize as a "Restfull" action. What I mean is that I would like to have an action that is called something like mymedia and would like tou routes requests that are directed to //mymedia . Currently, Zend understand it as the id to a getAction and off course this is not what I want.</p>  <p>Any help will be highly appreciated! Thanks</p>
