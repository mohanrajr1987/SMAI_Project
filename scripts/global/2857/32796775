<p>I'm currently working on an Apigility API which is based on Zend Framework 2. The Frontend is being developed with AngularJS.</p>  <p>For ZF2, there is a module which is called <a href="https://github.com/SocalNick/ScnSocialAuth" rel="nofollow">ScnSocialAuth</a> to implement Social Authentication. This is working. There are also Modules available for AngularJS, for example Satellizer where you can add auth Providers.</p>  <p>Users must be able to register using Social Authentication Providers like Facebook and Google+ to register their user.</p>  <p><strong>To my Question:</strong>  What is the correct flow? Should I implement this on the frontend and send the authentication data to my API, or is this a job which my API does directly?</p>
