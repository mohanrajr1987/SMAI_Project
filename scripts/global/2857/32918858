<p>I want to integrate <a href="https://github.com/PHPOffice/PHPWord" rel="nofollow">Phpword</a> into one of my Zend Framework 1.12 projects . However, I am facing problems integrating it with the Zend Framework Loader. I have tried including the src folder to the project library. </p>  <pre><code>protected function _initPhpword() { $autoloader = Zend_Loader_Autoloader::getInstance(); $autoloader-&gt;registerNamespace('PhpWord\\'); } </code></pre>  <p>and then tried to include using the Bootstrap and by including in the controller.</p>  <pre><code>use PhpOffice\PhpWord\Autoloader; class NoteController extends Zend_Controller_Action { public function createAction() { $phpClass = new Autoloader(); $phpWord = $phpClass-&gt;register(); </code></pre>  <p>How to include Phpword into the Zend Framework and thereafter how to register it in the project?</p>
