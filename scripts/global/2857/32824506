<p>I am trying to locate a zend framework 1 user extended library. I believe it is the library that influenced <code>Zend_Application</code>, and I know it had some approved components that were migrated into the <code>Zend Framework 1</code> official codebase.  It was one of the more popular, if not, most popular custom user libraries. </p>  <p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
