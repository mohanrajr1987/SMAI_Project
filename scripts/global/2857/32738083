<p>I have a pdf document that contains several pages.  Each page can has another orienatation as the other pages.  We are using the Zend Framework in Version 1.12</p>  <p>Assuming page 1,2 and 4 are portrait and page 3 is landscape. </p>  <p>Target: all pages are in portrait mode.</p>  <pre><code>        $pdf = Zend_Pdf::load($this-&gt;getFile());         foreach ($pdf-&gt;pages as $index =&gt; $page) {             /**              * @var Zend_Pdf_Page $page              * @var integer       $index              */             if (595 === $page-&gt;getHeight()) {                 $page-&gt;rotate(0, 0, deg2rad(90));                 $pdf-&gt;pages[$index] = $page;             }         }         $pdf-&gt;save($this-&gt;getFile().'.new.pdf'); </code></pre>  <p>Result: same as before :/</p>  <p>What is wrong? Is it even possible? Thanks in advance.</p>
