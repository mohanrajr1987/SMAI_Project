<p>I have been using Zend since over 2 years now and have setup environment around 10-12 times but I never got any success installing zend using composer. The error says I should have PHP version same or above required version which is always is the case. I even tried changing the version in the composer to match exactly the version with my PHP and some times installing the exact same version of PHP to match zend requirement and I always gets the same error.</p>  <p>How do I handle this?</p>  <p>Error:</p>  <pre><code>Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.  zendframework/zendframework 2.3.9 requires php &gt;=5.3.23 -&gt; your PHP version (5.3.6) or "config.platform.php" value does not satisfy that requirement  PHP 5.3.6 (cli) (built: Mar 17 2011 10:48:37) Copyright (c) 1997-2011 The PHP Group Zend Engine v2.3.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2011 Zend Technologies </code></pre>
