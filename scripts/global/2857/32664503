<p>I have these URL's like</p>  <pre> www.xyz.com/blog/index www.xyz.com/tutorial/index </pre>  <p>etc - Because I dont want the index to be shown in the URL - I have written routes to fix this issue:</p>  <pre> resources.router.routes.blog.route = "/blog/" resources.router.routes.blog.defaults.controller = blog resources.router.routes.blog.defaults.action = index </pre>  <p>So now when a user types </p>  <p>www.xyz.com/blog - the index action opens up.</p>  <p>What I want is - when a user enters  www.xyz.com/blog/index - </p>  <p>it should get redirected to www.xyz.com/blog </p>  <p>Basically the index should not show up in the URL whether or not the user enters it in the URL - How can I achieve this?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
