<p>I'm using node for server side processing - going through big data files, and inserting into the db.  This will be run nightly on a cron job.  In the program have several tasks that need to be accomplished.  I have set up <code>child_process</code> so that it does these distinct tasks correctly.  However, I would like to have one error handling section for the whole thing.  If any step goes wrong, I would like to have an email sent to me so that I know.  When I saw this I thought that it would catch errors in the child processes and allow me to send an email with the problem.</p>  <pre><code>process.on('error', function (err) {         console.log("Error running Scripts")         sendErr(err);     }); </code></pre>  <p>However I quickly found out that this only catches errors in spawning the process, not in the actual execution.  But then I found the <code>uncaughtException</code> event, and replaced <code>error</code> in the code above with <code>uncaughtException</code>.  Unfortunately, it did not work as I would have hoped, and the code is not run, and the email is not sent.  Does anybody know how to do this, or see what i am doing wrong.  Here is my current code</p>  <pre><code>var process = childProcess.fork(scriptName, {cwd:scriptWorkingDirectory}); process.on('uncaughtException', function (err) {     console.log("Error running Scripts")     sendErr(err); }); </code></pre>
