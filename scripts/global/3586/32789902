<p>I want to use the Data property to store information I want to throw in a new exception and I've figured out how I can loop through each of the DictionaryEntries with   this snippet</p>  <pre><code>foreach (DictionaryEntry de in ex.Data) </code></pre>  <p>But what I'd prefer to do is get the value by its key name because I have different object types in that Data object. its easier to cast them to the right kind of object if I can get the value by its key name.</p>  <p>Anyone know how to get the Exception.Data dictionary entries by key name?</p>
