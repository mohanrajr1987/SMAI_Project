<p>I have a large C++ program. I found that some functions may throw exceptions but others not. If exception happened, the program would crash. So, try-catch is helpful. But there are so many functions. Is there a tool which automatically list all the functions which may throw exception? If so, lots of time will be saved.</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>  <p>How can I move this question to Programmers? It is off-topic here.</p>
