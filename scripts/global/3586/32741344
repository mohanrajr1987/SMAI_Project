<p>I have a simple SQL*Loader job that runs daily.  I receive an input file and I have defined the columns as positional values from the fixed length file.</p>  <p>I need to add something to the SQL*Loader ctl file where I can capture the oracle exception if it is trying to insert a duplicate record.  Is that possible? How would I do it?   </p>  <p>Or do I need to create a stored procedure ? I want to avoid creating a stored procedure because the file has lots of columns that will have to be defined as my input parameters.</p>
