<pre><code>class Test {      public static void main(String []args){         int b[] = new int[10];         try{             a = b[9];         }         catch(Error e){             System.out.println(e);         }     } } </code></pre>  <p>Here the variable a is not declared thus it throws an Error Exception. However the catch block fails to catch such type of Exception. Why is it so? I also tried changing the from Error to Exception which also failed to work. </p>
