<p>I want to check 2 states (conditions) of a single function in a try block before going to catch block.</p>  <p>I have a search functionality, that holds true for one of the two following webdriver waits as long as the functionality works properly.</p>  <pre><code>1. new WebDriverWait(driver, 5).until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(kenshoSearchVerify)); 2. new WebDriverWait(driver,5).until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(kenshoNoResultVerify)); </code></pre>  <p>I have a test where user enters the term in the box, if result exist for the search term, then 1 holds true, and if no result exist then 2 holds true.</p>  <p>Now I want to add a third option here, to check if the search functionality is broken or not, whether it is finding one of the above two waits or not.</p>  <p>I have my function like this,</p>  <pre><code>public void kenshoSearch(String searchTerm) throws Exception     {          driver.findElement(kenshoSearchBox).sendKeys(searchTerm);         try{             new WebDriverWait(driver, 5).until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(kenshoSearchVerify));             new WebDriverWait(driver,5).until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(kenshoNoResultVerify));         }         catch(Exception e){             Assert.fail("Something's wrong with the search!");         }      } </code></pre>  <p>How can I check the two waits in try block before moving forward to catch block? The above code is clearly wrong in the try block.</p>
