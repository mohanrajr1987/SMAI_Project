<p>The act of attempting to open a file in Python can throw an exception. If I'm opening the file using the <code>with</code> statement, can I catch exceptions thrown by the <code>open</code> call and the related <code>__enter__</code> call without catching exceptions raised by the code within the <code>with</code> block?</p>  <pre><code>try:     with open("some_file.txt") as infile:         print("Pretend I have a bunch of lines here and don't want the `except` below to apply to them")         # ...a bunch more lines of code here... except IOError as ioe:     print("Error opening the file:", ioe)     # ...do something smart here... </code></pre>  <p>This question is different from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24878601/catching-an-exceptions-in-enter-in-the-calling-code-in-python">this older one</a> in that the older one is about writing a context manager, rather than using the familiar <code>with open</code>.</p>
