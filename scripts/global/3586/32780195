<p>The following example is very simple. I want to execute <strong>map()</strong> with a function which can raise Exception. It will be more clearly with an example : </p>  <pre><code>number_list = range(-2,8)  def one_divide_by(n):     return 1/n  try:     for number, divide in zip(number_list, map(one_divide_by, number_list)):         print("%d : %f" % (number, divide)) except ZeroDivisionError:     # Execution is stopped. I want to continue mapping     pass </code></pre>  <p>When I execute this code I get : </p>  <pre><code>-2 : -0.500000 -1 : -1.000000 </code></pre>  <p>It's due to the 0 in my list. I don't want remove this 0 (because in real case I can't know first if I will get Exception). Do you know how to <strong>continue mapping after the exception</strong> ?</p>
