<p>There are a lot of fail-safe processes in the Java application, which I test. This means, all the exceptions are caught and logged. I want to check, how many, and what kind of exceptions occurred during the test run.  How can I do it?</p>  <p>We are using Logback to log.</p>  <p>My first idea is to write logs to a file, and parse it in the test, but it isn't so nice and fast solution. Any better idea?</p>
