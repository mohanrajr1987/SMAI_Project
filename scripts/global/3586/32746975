<p>We have a tomcat webapp which happens to throw some scary SAML authentication exception deep within crazy Spring SAML internals during a somewhat normal invalid login attempt.  The exception is unhandled and user is redirected to a semi-helpful error page using</p>  <pre><code>   &lt;error-page&gt;       &lt;exception-type&gt;com.test.SomeException&lt;/exception-type&gt;       &lt;location&gt;/error.jsp&lt;/location&gt;    &lt;/error-page&gt; </code></pre>  <p>It works fine, except tomcat still logs that unhandled exception in the catalina.out.  Is there some simple way to prevent it from polluting the log file with the strack traces (which get picked up by the log monitoring software etc) w/o restructuring everything?  And what is the proper way of dealing with this anyways?  </p>
