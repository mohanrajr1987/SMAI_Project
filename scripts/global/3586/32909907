<p>My first ever stack overflow question, so please forgive any stupidity/naivety on my part here.</p>  <p>I have a BizTalk 2010 R2 solution that is using the <a href="http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/StoreInLibrary.html" rel="nofollow" title="Claim Check">Claim Check</a>  integration pattern implemented with custom pipeline components to move large (currently up to 1Gb) .mp4 files to a folder location on receive and pick them up again on send so that they don't go through the BizTalkMsgBoxDb.</p>  <p>Occasionally we get an error in the receive of the files that leads to exceptions being raised in the receive port.  We use the 'Enable routing for failed messages' setting to avoid the instance suspending in the system, but this causes the large .mp4 file to be dragged into the message box and, ultimately, the EsbExceptionDb.  Obviously not the ideal solution.</p>  <p>I could implementent code in the custom receive pipeline component to deal with specific types of error but I do wonder whether there is a better way of handling this so that <em>any</em> exception - expected or unexpected - would result in the large file being routed to a failed file store elsewhere without entering the BizTalkMsgBoxDb at any time.</p>  <p>Any advice gratefully received.</p>
