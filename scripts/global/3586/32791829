<p>If I have a function <code>foo_1</code> that calls <code>foo_2</code>, and <code>foo_2</code> can raise an exception that I want to handle in <code>foo_1</code>. How can I do that?</p>  <p>I want to write something like this, so that I only have to deal with one <code>begin</code>/<code>rescue</code> block:</p>  <pre><code>def foo_1   begin     foo_2   rescue SomeException     # Do stuff   end end  def foo_2   # Do stuff that can throw SomeException end </code></pre>  <p>How can I pass the exception from <code>foo_2</code>?</p>
