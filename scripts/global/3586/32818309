<p>In <a href="http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ihi0038a/IHI0038A_ehabi.pdf" rel="nofollow">the exception handling ABI for the ARM architecture</a> it gives the format of the "ARM defined compact model" exception handling table entries, but no information about the "generic model" EHT entries beyond the fact that the first word is the offset of the personality routine.</p>  <p>Is there a document anywhere that gives the format of these entries beyond the first word? I can see there is a pattern to the first three words that occur in every entry, for example:</p>  <pre><code>0553ff7f a908b100 ffff019c 80808000 92808080 00a48080 8000b680 80800000 ba808080 00848080 80000000 </code></pre>  <p>(byte order is reversed)</p>  <p>The second word seems to vary between several values for each entry, and the third word almost always ends with ffff (in one case I've seen it's 10ff).  The first byte of the third word sometimes indicates the length of the entry (enough of the time that it's not a coincidence but not enough that it's a rule).</p>  <p>I see the words after the first 3 repeating regularly between entries but I have no idea how to interpret them either.</p>  <p>Documents I've looked at: </p>  <ul> <li><a href="http://www.csee.umbc.edu/portal/help/architecture/24525601.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.csee.umbc.edu/portal/help/architecture/24525601.pdf</a></li> <li><a href="https://mentorembedded.github.io/cxx-abi/exceptions.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://mentorembedded.github.io/cxx-abi/exceptions.pdf</a></li> <li><a href="https://mentorembedded.github.io/cxx-abi/abi-eh.html" rel="nofollow">https://mentorembedded.github.io/cxx-abi/abi-eh.html</a></li> </ul>
