<p>How can I handle unexpected error in my expressjs app to avoid downtime?</p>  <p>First I thought to use try-catch method to handle unexpected error, but it seems to be working only with synchronous code. Other method I found is using nodejs domain module, but it seems to be deprecated.</p>  <p>I am handling errors using standard error handling middleware provided by express generator. I am also using npm forever module in my app. </p>  <p>Does using a process monitor like forever is sufficient or should I follow any different approach to handle unexpected error?</p>
