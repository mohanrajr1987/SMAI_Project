<p>I'm removing a temporary file with <code>NSFileManager</code> like this:</p>  <pre><code>let fm = NSFileManager() fm.removeItemAtURL(fileURL) // error: "Call can throw but it is not marked with 'try'" </code></pre>  <p>I don't really care if the file is there when the call is made and if it's already removed, so be it.</p>  <p>What would be an elegant way to tell Swift to ignore any thrown errors, without using <code>do/catch</code>?</p>
