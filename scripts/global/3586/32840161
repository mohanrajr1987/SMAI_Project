<p>I want to capture the exceptions throughout the whole application and save them to my database. I am having difficulty choosing what approach to use. I know I want the exceptions to be handled globally. I am refering to this source :<a href="https://spring.io/blog/2013/11/01/exception-handling-in-spring-mvc" rel="nofollow">https://spring.io/blog/2013/11/01/exception-handling-in-spring-mvc</a> and I have my @controlleradvice but the exceptions do not come throught it at all. Could anyone provide me with a specific example of how to do this? </p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
