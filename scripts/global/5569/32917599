<p>So here is an example of the function I need to replicate:</p>  <pre><code>document.getElementById('img1').onmouseover = function() {     document.getElementById('img1').style.width = expandTo + '%';      expandCompensate(1); }  document.getElementById('img1').onmouseout = function() {     expandReset(); } </code></pre>  <p>The situation is that I have a <code>for</code> loop creating some <code>div</code> elements, and the number of them is dynamic.  As of right now, I have it creating 4 div elements, so I created 4 iterations of the above functions for <code>img1</code>, <code>img2</code>, <code>img3</code> and <code>img4</code>.  But what I would like to do is to have the <code>onmouseover</code> and <code>onmouseout</code> functions created dynamically based on how many <code>div</code> elements I've decided to create (based on a variable).</p>  <p>Is there any way to do this?  Here is all the code for context (it's not much), there are comments in the JS with explanations for everything.  The part I'm trying to automate is at the bottom:</p>  <p><a href="https://jsfiddle.net/4w0714su/3/" rel="nofollow">https://jsfiddle.net/4w0714su/3/</a></p>  <p>And here is the working example for context of what I'm trying to achieve:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.ericsartor.ca/imgwide" rel="nofollow">http://www.ericsartor.ca/imgwide</a></p>  <p>FYI: The image is I picked were random, I just needed high res images.  Just doing this for practice!  Thanks to anyone that can help me figure this out!</p>
