<p>The script runs up until the 'takenotes' function is called and then just stops when it should run the function. There isn't any errors it just stops. Why is this?</p>  <pre><code># Please note that this only works in integer values, since there is no change in pence notes = (1,5,10,20,50) #Value of notes quantities = [10,8,5,5,1] #Quantities of notes # Defining variables notesout = [] total = 0 x = -1 payment = [] # This loop works out the total amount of cash in the cash register while (x &lt; 4):         x += 1         calc = notes[x]*quantities[x]         total += calc mon_nd = 70 # Money needed def takenotes():         print("Please input each notes value, when finished type \"stop\"")         # If input is an int then add to payment list, if not then work out the change         payment = [20,20,20,20]         main()  def main():         # Finds the value of the cash given         paymentV = sum(payment)         changeT = paymentV - mon_nd         # Change the quantities of the 'quantities' variable         for i in payment:                 quantities[notes.index(i)] = quantities[notes.index(i)] + 1         while(changeT &lt; 0):                 # Works out what amount of change should be given                 for i in reversed(notes):                         if (changeT - i &gt;= 0):                                 notesout.append(i)                                 quantities[notes.index(i)] = quantities[notes.index(i)]-1                                 changeT -= i                         else:                                 return True         print(notesout) takenotes() </code></pre>
