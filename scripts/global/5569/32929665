<pre><code>def power(num, x = 1):     result = 1     for i in range(x):         result = result * num     return result </code></pre>  <p>So I came across a tutorial on calling functions with 2 arguments and this one in the picture was used as an example to show how you could make a function called power(num, x=1) that takes an interval in the first argument and raises it to the power of the second argument. Can someone explain in laymen's terms why this happens and what exactly is going on in this function and 'for' loop?</p>
