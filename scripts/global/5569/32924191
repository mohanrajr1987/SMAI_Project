<p>I am trying to do something like this: Create an object and bind its member functions to functions from a DLL. For example,</p>  <pre><code>class A { private: int a; public: void func_a(); }; </code></pre>  <p>When loading from a DLL I want to create an A object, and set func_a to a function that is loaded from the DLL</p>  <pre><code>A aObj; (aObj.*func_a)() = getAdr(&amp;s, h, "fmiGetTypesPlatform");  </code></pre>  <p>I do not know the syntax for it, but I mean I want to set the result of </p>  <pre><code>getAdr(&amp;s, h, "fmiGetTypesPlatform");   </code></pre>  <p>to an object's member function</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
