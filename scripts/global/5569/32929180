<p>I have a program that uses Python tkinter to make radio buttons. I have 3 different variables , and each variable can be selected by selecting one out of many inputs which are specific to each variable (meaning there are like 5 inputs per variable, for example)</p>  <p>for example</p>  <pre><code>radio1 = Radiobutton(someframe, text='somevalue', value=1, variable=thismyvar) radio2 = Radiobutton(someframe, text='somevalue2', value=2, variable=thismyvar) radio3 = Radiobutton(someframe, text='somevalue3', value=3, variable=thismyvar) </code></pre>  <p>Then repeat this 2 more times for variable=thismyvar2 and variable=thismyvar3. </p>  <p>I then have a function that will submit the variable values into a form. I was wondering how to pass it to that function? </p>
