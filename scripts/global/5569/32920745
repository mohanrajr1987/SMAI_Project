<p>have been looking around for this answer it this. It feels basic, but i must be doing something wrong.</p>  <p>I have a function, which using Alamofire pulls in a JSON feed, parses it. I then want to use elements from this to update various labels in my UI. </p>  <pre><code>func collectData(){       Alamofire.request(.GET, "http://xxxxxxxx.co.uk/xxxx.php")         .responseJSON { response in             print(response.request)  // original URL request              if let JSONtest = response.result.value {                  let json = JSON(JSONtest)                   if let name = json[0]["Name"].string {                  }               }     }   }  collectData()  usernameLabel.text = name </code></pre>  <p>Obviously, the function just runs, and within the function I can print((name)) or print((JSONtest)) and they both print as expected.   How do I use an updated variable from within the function elsewhere in my project. </p>  <p>If I put usernameLabel.text = name in the function, it works fine.</p>  <p>I can create the constant outside of the method, and outside of the class but this only affects the initial value, not the amended one.</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>  <p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>  <p>So i've discovered that this is happening because Alamofire and SwiftyJSON are asyncronous, and that only variables in the request will work. I've tried to put my code into the request. Some of it has worked, but it looks a bit of a mess. </p>  <p>Also, I want to pull a URL from the database and on a button click, goto that URL. I don't see how I can do that, as I can't have an IBAction in the request....</p>
