<p>I know this has been a question asked but I cant seem to find it. Im asking a user for how much snow fell each month so that was easy</p>  <pre><code>year=print(input("Hello, what year of snowfall are you checking? ")) count=0 jan=print(input("How much snow fell during the month of January? ")) feb=print(input("How much snow fell during the month of Febuary? ")) mar=print(input("How much snow fell during the month of March? ")) </code></pre>  <p>but my professor later sent an email that "This should be implemented using ONE input statement, not three."  We are currently learning functions and the use of <code>def</code> and I cant find an implementation of them I came up with this for a "one input line" but I don't think this is how he wanted me to do it</p>  <pre><code>j,f,m = print(input("Please enter the snowfall for january, febuary and march here: ")).split()     j=int(j)     f=int(f)     m=int(m) </code></pre>  <p>Thanks in advance, before college I knew nothing of programming. </p>
