<p>In C#, I have a set of function candidates that will run in the future:   void func1(int); void func2(float); void func3(string);...and many more.</p>  <p>some code will decide which func123... will run (or none will run), and decide the parameter value}</p>  <p>if (ConditionMetToRun){run that function with parameter;}</p>  <p>How can I do this??</p>  <hr>  <p>ok here's an example</p>  <blockquote>   <p>void WearSunStuff(whichSunscreen, whichSunglasses);</p>      <p>void OpenUmbrella(whichUmbrella);</p>      <p>void WearCoat(whichCoat);</p> </blockquote>  <p>Then I look out the windows and see it's raining. I'd better open my umbrella.  But I'm at home, I don't need to open my favorite black umbrella YET.</p>  <pre><code>If(FriendingIsCallingMeToGoOutside) {      OpenUmbrella(blackUmbrella);     GoOutSideToMeetMyFriend(); } </code></pre>  <p>or..... Then I look out the windows and see it's really co. I'd better wear my coat.  But I'm at home, I don't need to open my favorite yellow coat YET.</p>  <pre><code>If(FriendingIsCallingMeToGoOutside) { WearCoat(yelloCoat); GoOutSideToMeetMyFriend(); } </code></pre>
