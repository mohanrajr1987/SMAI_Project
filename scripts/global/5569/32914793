<p>I have a php function called <code>wc_print_notices</code> that is in the core files of woocommerce, and I don't wish to edit the core files if I can avoid it. </p>  <p>So I would like to write something in my functions.php file that will add more functionality to this function. </p>  <p>I've tried using filters, however, those only work with woocommerce functions that act as hooks, and this is a function that is called through a hook, so <code>do_action()</code> and <code>add_filter</code> do not work with <code>wc_print_notices</code></p>  <p>I want to add related products to this function, and have tried something like this  </p>  <pre><code>function popup_products( $popup ){     $popup = woocommerce_output_related_products();   return $popup; } </code></pre>  <p>The function itself works perfectly, however, I want to add this to the function <code>wc_print_notices</code></p>  <p>the filters I tried were:</p>  <pre><code>add_filter( 'wc_print_notices', 'popup_products', 1, 1); add_filter( 'wc_print_notices', 'popup_products', 99, 99); add_filter( 'wc_print_notices', 'popup_products', 1); add_filter( 'wc_print_notices', 'popup_products', 99); </code></pre>
