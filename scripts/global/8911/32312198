<p>I have following <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/si-contact-form/" rel="nofollow">plugin</a>. The problem is that sometimes (looks like randomly) after submitting contact form the page stucks at 403 error and user is blocked temporarly on whole website. I tried to contact support of plugin, but to be honest they did not help at all. They recommendation is to switch off/on all plugins and see what will happen, which didn't help.</p>  <p>I "guess" that problem is somewhere in <code>POST</code> method. It creates some URL which is forbidden by server. I am not sure, therefore I want to ask someone for further examination of that problem on my <a href="http://www.ourtriparoundtheworld.com/contact-us/" rel="nofollow">site</a>.</p>
