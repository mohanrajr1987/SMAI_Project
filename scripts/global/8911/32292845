<p>So I'm coding exclusively in HTML and CSS for this project. I have certain parts of my form marked as required. At the bottom, the submit button looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;input type="submit" value="submit" onClick="location.href='thankyou.html'"&gt; </code></pre>  <p>When I click submit, even if the required spaces are blank, it still directs to that page which says it's been submitted succesfully. I want it to stay on that page and show that the form is incomplete and only successfully submit when the required spots are filled. </p>
