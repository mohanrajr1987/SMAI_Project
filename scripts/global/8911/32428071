<p>How can I avoid leaving the current page when calling <code>form.submit()</code>? The form I am working with is dynamically created with JavaScript.</p>  <p>I don't want to use jQuery if possible.</p>  <p><strong>Edit:</strong> Basically what I want is having a JavaScript function which sends a POST to an arbitrary site and stays the whole time on the site 'it was executed on'. It does not necessarily have to be done with a form! Doing it with a form was just the most intuitiv way at least for me.</p>
