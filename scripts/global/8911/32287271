<p>I've been searching the internet for hours to try to understand how to make a dismissible green alert slide down (non-modal) when a user submits a form. I'm thinking it has something to do with form validation but not sure. Please help. </p>  <p>The code isn't working, because when I click submit on the form, nothing happens. The  validation is not applying to the form. (the form action attribute has been left empty.) method="post" </p>  <p>I am using a form processing script provided by the server (not sure if that makes a difference.) </p>  <p>so my question is: how can I "link" the submit button to send the form to the sever, then show a dismissible success alert via jQuery that will fit into a col-md-4?</p>
