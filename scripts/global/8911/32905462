<p>We are having an aspx website that has the form fields with the submit button, the post-back for the site used to happen normally, all of a sudden we are not able to perform postback in the website. And after clearing the browser cache we are able to perform the postback in the website. </p>  <p>This seems to be strange behavior as temporarily for some of the users on button click only the form reloads and nothing happens. The application seems to behave normally after the browser cache clear, any advice on the same is highly appreciated, as the users do not accept the workaround often.</p>  <p>Regards Arvind</p>
