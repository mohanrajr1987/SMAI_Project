<p>I would like to auto-submit a form on my page after a short delay based on a variable value (which is present in the URL string, as well as declared by another JS script). Not sure what the best practice way to do this would be?</p>  <p>MY PAGE URL: <a href="http://www.domain.com/mypageaddress?var_1=value1&amp;var_2=value2&amp;" rel="nofollow">http://www.domain.com/mypageaddress?var_1=value1&amp;var_2=value2&amp;</a><strong>var_3=Returning%20Applicant</strong>&amp;var_4=value4</p>  <p>So when var_3=Returning%20Applicant , the form should submit without user input (and I would love a 1-second delay built in before that auto submit). Another script on the page also declares a JS variable for that same condition that might be easier to work with than the query string - JS var/value pair <strong>returningapplicant=1</strong> is the same as the URL string <strong>var_3=Returning%20Applicant</strong> that I'm trying to target. This is powered by a third party tool which I don't 100% understand, but they say that this JS variable can be referenced.</p>  <p>I would love some sample code that I could try for this function. Any help much appreciated and here's the extra info that will probably be needed for the JS script:</p>  <p><strong>FORM ACTION URL</strong></p>  <pre><code>&lt;form method="post" action="https://www.tfaforms.com/responses/processor" class="hintsSide labelsLeftAligned" id="tfa_0"&gt; </code></pre>  <p><strong>CURRENT FORM SUBMIT ELEMENT</strong></p>  <pre><code>&lt;div class="actions" id="tfa_0-A"&gt;&lt;input type="submit" class="primaryAction" value="Next"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>
