<p>I've already asked this question over at the Wordpress forum, but got no response. I saw several posts about changing it to a 'return false', but no luck either. I'm currently trying to generate directions through the Google Maps API v3. I want to combine this with Contact Form 7 in Wordpress. When a user submits the form, I want to calculate the directions between point A and point B.</p>  <p>The input field id's are grabbed through a JS file and hooked to the API. When I press submit, Contact Form 7 generates the failure to send message.</p>  <p>The inside of my form looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div id="calculate-route"&gt;[submit "Send"]&lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>This is in the JS file:</p>  <pre><code>$("#calculate-route").submit(function(event) { event.preventDefault(); calculateRoute($("#from-point").val(), $("#to-point").val()); }); </code></pre>  <p>Any ideas why event.preventDefault() isn't working? I enqueued the JS script succesfully in the footer. Using a plain HTML form generates the map and directions properly. </p>  <p>Any help is gladly appreciated.</p>
