<p>i am trying to submit my xcode OS X project and i get the following errors: a) Missing required icons.The application bundle does not contain an icon in ICNS format,containing both a 512x512 and a 512x512@2x image.  I do not understand why i get this error , since i created an icns using the  “Icon Composer 2x”  app. I included the icons and icons in the project. In info.plist i added an entry: “Icon file” entry with value : “the name of the icns without .icns extension”. b) The product archive is invalid. The info.plist must contain a LSApplicationCategoryType key , whose value is the UTI for a valid category.<br> I do not understand why i get this error , since in info.plist i added an entry:LSApplicationCategoryType-Application category with value: Education It seems like i am doing everything right but for some reason i get the above errors. I was wondering if you could help me ,please? I would appreciate any help.</p>
