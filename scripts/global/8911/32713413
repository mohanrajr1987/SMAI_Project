<p>i'm having a problem with submitting checkboxes that are hidden on page load.</p>  <p>I have a large form that I've split into several blocks. All of them are hidden on load and when the user selects a specific type of device I just show a block that contains inputs for that specific device type.</p>  <p>The problem occurs when submitting an input block that contains checkboxes. All other inputs (text, dropdowns...) submit fine, but checkboxes don't submit anything.</p>  <p>I removed the CSS class that hides the blocks and tried submitting then (so the whole form is visible on load), and checkboxes work in that case.</p>  <p>So... how do I actually get this to work? I know checkboxes as a HTML element don't post anything if they're not checked, but I didn't know about this "feature" if they're not present on load.</p>  <p>I'm using codeigniter btw, and just a regular POST - no ajax.</p>
