<p>I have a database with multiple tables</p>  <p>and the user can change the data in the table.</p>  <p>my problems is that I wont that nothing changes in the database until the user click the button "save", and even when he do - it submit only the table he decide to save</p>  <p>but in the meantime it is necessary that the user can see all the changes that he did. and every "select" must give him the modified data ,and not the base data.</p>  <p>how I can on the one hand not submit the data in the database, and On the other hand show the data modified to the user?</p>  <p>I thought to do a transaction and don't submit, (and use  read uncommitted) but for that I must don't close the connection (if I close without submit - all the changes are canceled) and I don't wont leave several of connection open.</p>  <p>I also thought to build a list of all the change, and whenever the user make a select - first searching from the list. but it is very complicated , and I prefer a simple solution</p>  <p>Thank you</p>
