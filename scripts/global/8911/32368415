<p>Is it possible to <strong>refresh a button box</strong> having a number of buttons, when a specific action is implemented such as Submit and Delete? On Submit a new button should be added and on Delete (after selecting the button), the button should get destroyed (not hiden). The GUI is designed using <em>Glade</em> in <em>Gtk-2</em> and codes are in the <em><strong>C</strong> language</em>.</p>
