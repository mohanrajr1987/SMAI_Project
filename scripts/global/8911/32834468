<p>I'm writing an snippet to upload images through AJAX. A user selects the image in a form file-input. The form has a onsubmit-function which prevents default, so that the page doesn't reload after submitting. In this function the formdata is captured and than send through a XMLHttpRequest which has some event listeners appended. Also the "load"-eventlistener. This "load"-function consists of things like hiding a loader and echo something like "finished uploading". The page where the data is transmitted through ajax has a php-script which scales the image, copy it, rename it and so on. To it creates various copies in different sizes of the image. </p>  <p>The Problem: If I submit the form NOT through ajax, everything is fine. The php-needs some seconds, till everything is saved and the page is loaded. Through Ajax, directly after submitting the form, it says "finished", but the php-script is not executed! It feels like AJAX stops PHP running the script. The "load"-function IS FIRED! But way to early! Almost directly after submitting...</p>  <p>Here's the JS-Code:</p>  <pre><code>loader("show"); window.event.preventDefault(); var data = $(form).serializeArray(); var src = form.getAttribute("action"); $.post( src, data ) .done(function( data ) {     loader("hide"); }); </code></pre>  <p>I have also tested with clean JS, but same problem:</p>  <pre><code>var formdata = $(form).serializeArray(); var page = form.getAttribute("action"); loader(show); var ajax = new XMLHttpRequest(); ajax.addEventListener("load", function(event) { completeHandler(event);}, false); ajax.open("POST",page); ajax.send(formdata); </code></pre>  <p>completeHandler:</p>  <pre><code>function completeHandler ( evt ) {     alert("finished");     loader("hide"); } </code></pre>  <p>Thanks for help! :)</p>  <p><strong>EDIT:</strong> The HTML:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;form method="post" action="create.php" onSubmit="uploadForm(this)" enctype="multipart/form-data"&gt; &lt;input id="file1" type="file" name="image"&gt; &lt;input type="submit" value="Add" name="submit"&gt; &lt;/form&gt; </code></pre>
