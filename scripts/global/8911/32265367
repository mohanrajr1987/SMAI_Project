<p>I have a form whose code was already written and it is a "form submit" type. But now I've got a new requirement . It is the same form submit on clicking the submit button I need display a processing symbol upon successful validation of form element values and navigate to the  thank you page. My question is can I simulate the already form submit as an ajax call so that I no need to change the existing code and place a new big dump of code for ajax call. Is it possible to simulate an ajax call type of form submit in normal form submit?</p>
