<p>Im developing a PHP webapp which have user profiles to create &amp; modify &amp; delete (you know)</p>  <p>When I modify I profile I send the $userID to the PHP page and then I load all the user data. That $userID is store into a hidden input because I need it to launch the UPDATE query after submit.</p>  <p>I have noticed that user can press F12 and change that userID to another one and could modify (or delete) other user profile.</p>  <p>Sorry if is a stupid question, I suppose that this is a common problem in forms submitting, but I don't know how you face it (what is the most secure strategy in this case).</p>  <p>Please help :-)</p>
