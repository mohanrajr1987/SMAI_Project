<p>I have most of my <strong>MVC 4</strong> web application ready. I have even developed the password auto-generation algorithm. Now I am stuck as to how to show this password to the user.</p>  <p>The controller handling the <strong>Sign Up</strong> process is the one that will generate the password by calling a method from the <code>PasswordGenerator</code> class. I want to show this to the user in a message box using some jQuery.</p>  <p>I've tried passing it through <code>TempData</code> and <code>ViewBag</code> but the password can be seen in the HTML code sent over the internet. Is there anyway to do this securely without showing the password over the internet?</p>  <p><strong>FYI</strong>, sending an email with the password is not an option. This is a class project, not intended for something of that magnitude.</p>  <p>Any help would be appreciated. </p>
