<p>This is how my form looks now:- <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Oxg0T.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Oxg0T.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I am trying to do the following:-</p>  <ol> <li>Enter the group details.</li> <li>Enter a member.</li> <li>If more members are there, then click "add more members". This should show one more line with same controls('member name, place, age).</li> <li>Then after adding all members, click save. This should save both group details(master) and members in group(child).</li> </ol>  <p>Although I was able to display the details(already added) using viewmodel, But I could not find how to insert(save) this. I can use jquery to add one more row when "add more member" is clicked. But how to save after that is the major problem.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
