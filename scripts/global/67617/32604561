<p>I need to develop a chart using datavisualization. Now the chart looks like  below</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/qlcms.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/qlcms.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>In the above chart i am using rangebar to show min and max values, in rangebar the label (65---210) now comes in the middle part. But i need to show the min and max like one in red. ie min value in the start position of the rangebar and max value in the end position of the rangebar.</p>  <p>Please let me know if there is any way to do it</p>
