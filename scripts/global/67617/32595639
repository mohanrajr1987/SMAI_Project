<p>I am using ASP.NET MVC Razor C# with Attribute Routes</p>  <p>In my Category form when I click on Edit. it opens the Url like below:</p>  <p><a href="http://localhost:38812/Category/Database%20Design" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:38812/Category/Database%20Design</a></p>  <p>I am trying to change the Url like below</p>  <p><a href="http://localhost:38812/Category/Database-Design" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:38812/Category/Database-Design</a></p>  <p>Here the problem is, when I go to database to search for the category based details..it does not search because there is no category with the name of Database-Design. It exist as Database Design with space.</p>  <p>Is there any way to not include the Id in Url and so we can also achieve the below Url? : </p>  <p><a href="http://localhost:38812/Category/Database-Design" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:38812/Category/Database-Design</a></p>
