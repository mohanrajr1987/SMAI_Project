<p>I was wondering if it is possible to pass a model object through ViewBag.  I tried the following codes but somehow in my View, it is only the path of the model which is displayed.  </p>  <p><strong>Controller:</strong></p>  <pre><code>public ActionResult Tempo() {     DateTime date1 = new DateTime(1990, 1, 1);     Employee emp = new Employee(3, "fara", "hass", date1, 56.6m, 0);     ViewBag.EmployeeId = emp.EmployeeID;     ViewBag.Fname = emp.Fname;     ViewBag.Employee = emp; } </code></pre>  <p><strong>View:</strong></p>  <pre><code>@{     ViewBag.Title = "Tempo"; }  @model LayoutProject.Models.Employee  &lt;h2&gt;Tempo&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div&gt;     &lt;h4&gt;ViewBag&lt;/h4&gt;     &lt;br /&gt;     EmployeeID: @ViewBag.EmployeeId     &lt;br /&gt;     Fname: @ViewBag.Fname     &lt;br /&gt;     Employee : @ViewBag.Employee &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>The Fname and EmployeeId is correctly displayed but not the Employee itself.  Am I missing something here or it is simply not possible to pass a model through ViewBag?</p>
