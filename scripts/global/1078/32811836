<p>I've created an associated Enum, however i can't seem to figure out how to create an <code>if else</code> statement, which determine which. it does not seem to work, what i'm doing. What am i doing wrong? or is it not possible with associated enums.</p>  <pre><code>enum Type {     case Cat(name: String, outDoor: Bool)     case Dog(name: String, activityLevel: Int) } </code></pre>  <p><strong>class</strong></p>  <pre><code>class Person {     var type: Type? } </code></pre>  <p><strong>Function</strong></p>  <pre><code>func checkType(object: Person) {     if object.type == .Cat {     } } </code></pre>
