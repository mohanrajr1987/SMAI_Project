<p>I'm reading J.Bloch's Effective Java and come up with the following (Setcion about enums):</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Far fewer enums benefit from associating multiple behaviors with a   single method. In this relatively rare case, prefer constant-specific   methods to enums that switch on their own values</p> </blockquote>  <p>To me this case of using compile-time constants is not clear. Couldn't you provide a simple example reflecting that?</p>
