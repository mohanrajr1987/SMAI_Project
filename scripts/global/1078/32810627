<p>I would like to sort <code>ObservableCollection&lt;myClass&gt;</code> which, except for the other things, contains the <code>enum</code> property such as following:</p>  <pre><code>public IP_Enums.ExportType ExportType { get; set; } </code></pre>  <p>Where the structure of enum looks like following:</p>  <pre><code>    public enum ExportType     {         A1,         A2,         B1,         B2,         B3,         C1,         C2,         D1,         D2     } </code></pre>  <p>The problem I have is, that Export types under my <code>ObservableCollection&lt;myClass&gt;</code> are not in an order (as you can see in the enum definition), but like this e.g.:</p>  <pre><code>[0].ExportType = ExportType.B2 [1].ExportType = ExportType.A1 [2].ExportType = ExportType.D2 [3].ExportType = ExportType.A1 </code></pre>  <p>I would like to sort my collection based on this ExportType, but I am not quite sure how to do it (as I have [A-Z] character followed by digit [0-9].</p>  <p>Any help would be highly appreciated.</p>
