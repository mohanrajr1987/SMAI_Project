<p>I am trying to create an enum with commands for motor control in VB.NET. I want to set the command on one computer, serialize it, send it to another computer over a TCP connection, deserialize, and interpret the command. I know how to use the TCP connection, but I'm missing conceptual knowledge about the enum. I am using Protobuf-net to serialize and have the following description of commands. </p>  <pre><code>Public Class RemoteControl     &lt;ProtoContract&gt;     Public Class Command         &lt;ProtoContract&gt;        Enum CommandAction         &lt;ProtoMember(2)&gt;         HOME_MOTOR          &lt;ProtoMember(1)&gt;         MOVE_ABS         End Enum    End Class  End Class </code></pre>  <p>My question is, how do I set the instance of a <code>RemoteControl</code> object to the action I want? I know enums use integers, so to send a <code>MOVE_ABS</code> (which has a tag of 1), I tried </p>  <pre><code> Dim myAction As New RemoteControl  myAction.Command.CommandAction = 1 </code></pre>  <p>This returned an error saying "CommandAction is a type and cannot be used as an expression". </p>  <p>Also, once I do manage to figure out how to send this command, how would I interpret it on the other computer? Would the deserialized value of something like <code>RemoteControl.Command.CommandAction</code> be equal to 1 if the command sent was <code>MOVE_ABS</code>?</p>
