<p>I need to use the enumerator of the enum class multiple times in one block of code and I would like to avoid the classical enum from C++03. </p>  <pre><code>enum class Color {RED, GREEN}; {     Color::RED //this works     RED;       //how do I make this work (only for this block)? } </code></pre>  <p>I tried using </p>  <pre><code>using namespace Color; </code></pre>  <p>but it obviously did not work since Color is not a namespace.</p>
