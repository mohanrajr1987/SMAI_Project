<p>My vendor has provided me with an XSD that has an attribute defined as a String.  However in his spec, he indicates that this string can only have 1 of 3 values.</p>  <p>Ex:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;xs:complexType name="MitigationStatus"&gt;   &lt;xs:annotation&gt;     &lt;xs:documentation&gt;       This represents a list of mitigation statuses.  Can be OPEN, CLOSED, INVALID      &lt;/xs:documentation&gt;   &lt;/xs:annotation&gt;      &lt;xs:sequence&gt;     &lt;xs:element name="status" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded" type="xs:string"/&gt;   &lt;/xs:sequence&gt; &lt;/xs:complexType&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I would like to add something to my bindings file such that when I unmarhsal my XML, the status is not a String but rather an Enum.</p>  <p>All the docs I have found seem to indicate that the XSD requires the String to be of an enum type.  </p>  <p>Is there a way to bind the string to an Enum type even if the XSD is not an enum?</p>
