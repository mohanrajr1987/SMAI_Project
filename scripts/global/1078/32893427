<p>I have the following enumeration in some VB.Net code:</p>  <pre><code>Private Enum DayOfWeek     Sunday = 1     Monday = 2     Tuesday = 3     Wednesday = 4     Thursday = 5     Friday = 6     Saturday = 7 End Enum </code></pre>  <p>I then later have the following <code>Select Case</code> statement:</p>  <pre><code>Dim weekDay As DayOfWeek  weekDay = DatePart(DateInterval.Weekday, Now) Dim daysToAdd As Integer  Select Case weekDay     Case DayOfWeek.Saturday Or DayOfWeek.Sunday         daysToAdd = 0     Case DayOfWeek.Thursday Or DayOfWeek.Friday         daysToAdd = 4     Case Else         daysToAdd = 2 End Select </code></pre>  <p>So when I run the code, <code>weekDay</code> is set to the correct value (5) for today (Thursday). However, when it hits the <code>Select Case</code> statement, it keeps selecting the <code>Case Else</code> condition instead of the <code>DayOfWeek.Thursday</code> condition and I can't seem to figure out why. </p>  <p>Does anyone see some glaring mistake that I'm missing?</p>
