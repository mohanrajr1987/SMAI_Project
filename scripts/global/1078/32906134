<p>I have a project which requires me to have an array that stores two things for each entry:</p>  <ol> <li>the location of another entry in the array</li> <li>A Boolean value</li> </ol>  <p>To do this I've considered making a new object which has a location and boolean method which would store each of the two things above. And then I would just need to open a 2D matrix of this type object.</p>  <p>Here lies my problem, the size of the 2D matrix must match that of a level file which could be as big as 300*300. I need a way in which I could create and name an object for each cell in the 2D matrix. The name doesn't matter because I will just refer to it as Object[n][n].location. Is there a way to do this? To make a large amount of objects with different names? Without having to do each one by hand.</p>  <p>I'm also open to other methods of solving this problem, this is just the solution I've thought up.</p>
