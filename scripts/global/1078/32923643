<p>I am a newbie in Java. With this code:</p>  <pre><code>public class MyClass{    enum State {STATE1, STATE2, STATE3}    State curState;    ...    public MyClass(){       curState=STATE1;    } } </code></pre>  <p>I get error </p>  <blockquote>   <p>STATE1 cannot be resolved to variable</p> </blockquote>  <p>If I chage STATE1 to State.STATE1 everything works, but I don't want to write enum name every time! I don't understand why I have to. enum is declared in the MyClass scope. </p>
