<p>This is the current state: </p>  <p>A Java JAR file contains API functionality and a method <code>call(param)</code> that shall be called from a Jython script. <code>param</code> expects a custom data type being an enum object. </p>  <p>The enum object is defined as follows: </p>  <pre><code>public interface A extends Serializable { ...     public enum IPType {         IPV4("IPV4"),         IPV6("IPV6");          private String IPType;          IPType(String IPType) {             this.IPType = IPType;         }          public String getValue() {             return this.IPType;         }     } ... } </code></pre>  <p>I know that in Java you can easily call the function like this:  <code>call(A.IPType.IPV4)</code>. Somehow in Jython this does not seem to be the case. When trying to call it in the same way it yields the error: </p>  <pre><code>AttributeError: instance attr: IPType </code></pre>  <p>I appreciate your help in this topic, as it is not clear for me yet how the below error is generated.</p>
