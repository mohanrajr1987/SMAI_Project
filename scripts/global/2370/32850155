<p>I am writing an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_%28programming_language%29" rel="nofollow">R</a> script and am using library(ngram).</p>  <p>Suppose I have a string,</p>  <p>"good qualiti <strong>dog food</strong> bought sever vital can <strong>dog food</strong> product found good qualiti product look like stew process meat smell better labrador finicki appreci product better"</p>  <p>and want to find bi-grams.</p>  <p>The ngram library is giving me bi-grams as follows:</p>  <p>"appreci product" "process meat" "food product" "food bought" "qualiti dog" "product found" "product look" "look like" "like stew" "good qualiti" "labrador finicki" "bought sever" "qualiti product" "better labrador" <strong>"dog food"</strong> "smell better" "vital can" "meat smell" "found good" "sever vital" "stew process" "can dog" "finicki appreci" "product better"</p>  <p>As the sentence contains "dog food" two times, I want this bi-gram two times. But I am getting it once!</p>  <p>Is there an option in thengram library or any other library that gives all the bi-grams of my sentence in R?</p>
