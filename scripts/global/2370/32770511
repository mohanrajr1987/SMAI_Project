<p>I am following a course titled Natural Language Processing on Coursera, and while the course is informative, I wonder if the contents given cater to what am I looking for.<br /><br />Basically I want to implement a textual version of Cortana, or Siri for now as a project, i.e. where the user can enter commands for the computer in natural language and they will be processed and translated into appropriate OS commands. My question is<br /> <li>What is generally sequence of steps for the above applications, after processing the speech? Do they tag the text and then parse it, or do they have any other approach? <br /><br /> <li>Under which application of NLP does it fall? Can someone cite me some good resources for same? My only doubt is that what I follow now, shall that serve any important part towards my goal or not?</p>
