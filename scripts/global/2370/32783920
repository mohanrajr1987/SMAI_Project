<p>Hi i want to implement a system which can identify whether the given sentence is an incident or a sentiment.</p>  <p>I was going through python NLTK and found out that there is a way to find out positivity or negativity of a sentense.</p>  <p>Found out the ref link: <a href="http://text-processing.com/demo/sentiment/" rel="nofollow">ref link</a></p>  <p>I want to achieve like My new Phone is not as good as I expected should be treated as sentiment  and Camera of my phone is not working should be considered as incident.</p>  <p>I gave a Idea of making my own clusters for training my system for finding  out such but not getting  a desired solution is there a built-in way to find that or any idea on how can be approach for solution of same.</p>  <p>Advance thanks for your time.</p>
