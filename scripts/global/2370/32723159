<p>I want to find many sentences containing pair of words in a sentence database that is representative of a real world. For example - I would want many sentences that contain both words "person" and "walking". I have two questions:</p>  <p>Is there some large corpus available which I can directly invoke for this purpose? </p>  <p>If I have some such large corpora, id there online application available that does it for me? Or if I code it myself, how to go about it in Python? </p>
