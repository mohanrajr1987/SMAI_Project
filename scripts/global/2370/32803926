<p>My understanding of the work flow is to run LDA -> Extract keywards (e.g. the top few words for each topics), and hence reduce dimension -> some subsequent analysis.</p>  <p>My question is, if my overall purpose is to give topic to articles in an unsupervised way, or clustering similar documents together, then a running of LDA will take you directly to the goal. Why do you reduce the dimension and then pass it to subsequent analysis? If you do, what sort of subsequent analysis can you do after LDA?</p>  <p>Also, a bit unrelated question -- is it better to ask this question here or at cross validated?</p>
