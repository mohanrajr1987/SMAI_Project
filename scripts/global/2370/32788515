<p>I have got a problem while processing a corpus using the class <em>LexicalizedParser</em> of the Stanford Parser. </p>  <p>Sometimes the parsed sentence has a tree (generated using the <code>Tree parse(List)</code> method) that contains only XXs in each node as tags.</p>  <p>This means a failure, accordingly to the documentation: <a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/nlp/javadoc/javanlp/edu/stanford/nlp/parser/lexparser/LexicalizedParser.html#parse-java.util.List-" rel="nofollow">LexicalizedParser-parse(List)</a>.</p>  <p>Does anyone know which are the possible reasons that could make the LexicalizedParser fail?</p>
