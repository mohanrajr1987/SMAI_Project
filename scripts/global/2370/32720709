<p>Many algorithms are about extraction from a single doc. But I wanna know how can I extract keywords (or feature words) from a set of docs that they can represent the feature of this set of docs? Putting into all docs at a time to analyze could be too expensive. Is there some algorithm that I can process one doc at a time and then combine/calculate the results altogether to generate keywords of this set of docs?</p>
