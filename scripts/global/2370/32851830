<p>Otherwise said replace eigen vectors with pattern matching and graph traversal and emulate dimension reduction?</p>  <p>I mean that given a semantic graph of english words compute something similar to: </p>  <p><code>king - man = queen</code></p>  <p>Which means that I can subtract from a graph a subgraph and score the resulting subgraph given a metric.</p>  <p>I don't expect that this will be a single neo4j or gremlin query. I'm interested in the underlying mechanic involved in reasoning at the same time globaly and localy over a graph database.</p>
