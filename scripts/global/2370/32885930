<p>I'm working on a document clustering project in R. I have 100 pages, and for each pages I have extracted the keywords. Now, I would like to cluster the pages in a way that the same pages, with the same concept, fall into the same cluster.  </p>  <p>I have found a lots of document clustering codes, which just focused on the keywords clustering not the page clustering. Any suggestion or idea for my problem?</p>  <p>Many thanks in advance :)</p>
