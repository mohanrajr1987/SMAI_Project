<p>My program takes a text file and splits each sentence into a list however it can be inaccurate: </p>  <pre><code>str='i love carpets. In fact i own 2.4 km of the stuff.'  output:   listOfSentences = ['i love carpets', 'in fact i own 2', '4 km of the stuff'] </code></pre>  <p>how do i tell python not to split at numbers </p>  <pre><code>desired output:   listOfSentences = ['i love carpets', 'in fact i own 2.4 km of the stuff'] </code></pre>
