<p>I was wondering if there are any NLP techniques for document classification.  I was wondering if statistics of n-grams from part-of-speech tagging could be useful?  I can't seem to find too much in the literature on the topic..</p>  <p>Has anyone found any nlp technique that enhanced their document classification efforts?  If you know of any surveys on this topic that would be awesome.</p>  <p>Note.  I saw <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5499448/part-of-speech-pos-tag-feature-selection-for-text-classification">this question</a>, but my corpus is way too large for the only solution there to be practical.</p>
