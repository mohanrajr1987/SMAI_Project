<p>I have mined some training data from <code>Wikipedia/DBPedia</code> now (about 30MB of text). I would like to train this model with opennlp but it takes like forever. My Mac has an i7 / 4 cores and it is running now for over 13h but still it is <code>computing the event counts</code>. The problem could be, that it is not using <code>multithreading</code>. Do you have any experience with that? How can i improve this process?</p>
