<p>Problem Statement:-</p>  <p>I have multiple sentences like:-</p>  <p>"I am looking for a two bedroom house in MG Road", "I need a apartment type home on Old Airport Road", "I want a home in whitefield"</p>  <p>If I use POS Tagger then it can tag California as Location or Princeton University as Organization but what if I want my custom locations/organization to be tagged as well. How can I achieve that using NLTK? </p>
