<p>I have found a lot of information on correcting misspelled search queries in Solr but I haven't found much in regard to the data Solr searches having typos in it. For example if I search for "dachshunds", is there a way to ensure I also return "dacshunds"? Is there a way to tune for some amount of "close enough" tolerance? </p>  <p>In essence I have a lot of hand written notes to search through and people misspell stuff all the time in notes. I want to have my search results return things that are pretty close to right without having to explicitly define those misspellings in synonyms. </p>
