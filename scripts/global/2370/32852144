<p>I am doing my major project on trust evaluation. That is evaluating the trust from the feedback comments given by the users in the e-commerce websites. Actually this was an IEEE paper.</p>  <p>The algorithms used in this paper were : </p>  <ol> <li><p>Dependancy relation analysis</p></li> <li><p>Latent Dirichlet Allocation.</p></li> </ol>  <p>Reading that IEEE paper I was unable to draw any conclusion. So I kept searching on the internet but I didnt understand them. Can you please help me understand those algorithms giving examples.</p>  <p>This is the link of the actual topic:</p>  <p><a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6678358&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fstamp%2Fstamp.jsp%3Ftp%3D%26arnumber%3D6678358" rel="nofollow">CommTrust: Computing Multi Dimensional Trust By Mining E-Commerce Feedback Comments</a> </p>  <p>Pleaseee explain me these algorithms with an example.</p>
