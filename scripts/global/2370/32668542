<p>I know that this question was asked before - but the answer was not satisfying (in the sense of that the answer was just a link ).</p>  <p>So my question is, is there any way to extend the existing openNLP models? I already know about the technique with DBPedia/Wikipedia. But what if i just want to append some lines of text to improve the models - is there really no way? (If so - that would be really stupid...)</p>
