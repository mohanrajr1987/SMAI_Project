<p>I'm new to <code>nlp</code> and i have been reading a lot about <code>nltk</code>. I'm from South America and I want to start using nltk with Spanish texts. I read the docs but i only found how to stem Spanish words. Maybe I am wrong or maybe I just could not find that part of the documentation. I also read a few blogs about the subject.</p>  <p>The question is: Is there an "official" or most practical way to use pos tags in Spanish?</p>
