<p>I got a question about word classification in Spark. I am working on a simple classification model that takes a word (a single word), as an input and its predict the race of the named person (it is from a fictitious universe). For example, Gimli -> dwarf, Legolas -> elf.</p>  <p>My issue is on how to process the words. I know that Spark includes a two feature vectorization methods, tfâ€“idf and word2vec. However, I am having difficulties on understanding them and do not know which one to use.</p>  <p>Could anyone explained them to me and guide through the process?. And more importantly, I would like to know which of these methods is the most appropriate for this case.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
