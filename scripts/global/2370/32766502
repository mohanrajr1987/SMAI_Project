<p>Does somebody know a tool/project on Java which can normalize text (and store normalization log) and then build original source text?</p>  <p>Any approach is appreciated.</p>  <p>The problem: In order to process input data, we need to normalize it. </p>  <p>The process engine receives normalized text and returns matched positions.</p>  <p>After this step, we need to recover original source equivalent by normalized positions.</p>  <p>Example:</p>  <pre><code>Source: Lorem ipsum ad his scripta blandit partiendo, eum fastidii accumsan euripidis in, eum liber hendrerit an ... ütf Wórd èxämplé  Normalized text (approx): lorem ipsum scripta blandit partiendo, fastidi accumsan euripidis, liber hendrerit utf word example  Engine output: lorem ipsum scripta begin 0 end 19 euripidis           begin 56 end 65  Original source equivalent: Lorem ipsum ad his scripta begin 0 end 26 euripidis                  begin 69 end 78 </code></pre>  <p>Thanks for help</p>
