<p>Recently I approached to the NLP and I tried to use <a href="http://www.nltk.org" rel="nofollow">NLTK</a> and <a href="http://textblob.readthedocs.org" rel="nofollow">TextBlob</a> for analyzing texts. I would like to develop an app that analyzes reviews made by travelers and so I have to manage a lot of texts written in different languages. I need to do two main operations: POS Tagging and lemmatization. I have seen that in NLTK there is a possibility to choice the the right language for sentences tokenization like this:</p>  <pre><code>tokenizer = nltk.data.load('tokenizers/punkt/PY3/italian.pickle') </code></pre>  <p>I haven't found the the right way to set the language for POS Tagging and Lemmatizer in different languages yet. How can I set the correct corpora/dictionary for non-english texts such as Italian, French, Spanish or German? I also see that there is a possibility to import the "TreeBank" or "WordNet" modules, but I don't understand how I can use them.  Otherwise, where can I find the respective corporas?</p>  <p>Can you give me some suggestion or reference? Please take care that I'm not an expert of NLTK.</p>  <p>Many Thanks. </p>
