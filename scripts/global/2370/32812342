<p>I am new to NLP and its concepts. I am currently trying to use <a href="https://opennlp.apache.org/" rel="nofollow">OpenNLP</a> from Apache. When I try to use its parser tool as shown in <a href="http://www.programcreek.com/2012/05/opennlp-tutorial/" rel="nofollow">blog</a>, I get the output like:</p>  <pre><code>Input: Shutdown all active devices  Output:  (TOP(VP(VB Shutdown) (NP(DT all)     (JJ active)     (NNS devices)))) </code></pre>  <p>I am unable to understand what is the meaning of all the acronyms. Some of them I could understand from <a href="https://stanbol.apache.org/" rel="nofollow">Stanford's OpenNLP implementation</a> of the same. But not all.</p>  <p>Can anyone point me to some proper direction as to how can I understand it and better, as to how can my code understand what is being said.</p>
