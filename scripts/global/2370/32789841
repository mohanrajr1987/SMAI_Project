<p>I am trying to implement relation extraction between verb pairs. I want to use dependency path from one verb to the other as a feature for my classifier (predicts if relation X exists or not). But I am not sure how to encode the dependency path as a feature. Following are some example dependency paths, as space separated relation annotations from StanfordCoreNLP Collapsed Dependencies:</p>  <pre><code>nsubj acl nmod:from acl nmod:by conj:and nsubj nmod:into nsubj acl:relcl advmod nmod:of </code></pre>  <p>It is important to keep in mind that these path are of <strong>variable length</strong> and a relation could <strong>reappear</strong> without any restriction. </p>  <p>Two compromising ways of encoding this feature that come to my mind are: </p>  <p>1) Ignore the sequence, and just have one feature for each relation with its value being the number of times it appears in the path</p>  <p>2) Have a sliding window of length n, and have one feature for each possible pair of relations with the value being the number of times those two relations appeared consecutively. I suppose this is how one encodes n-grams. However, the number of possible relations is 50, which means I cannot really go with this approach. </p>  <p>Any suggestions are welcomed.</p>
