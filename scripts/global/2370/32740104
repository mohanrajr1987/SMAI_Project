<p>Stuck upon a rather trivial task that seems to lead to a wider problem.</p>  <p>Need to be able to generate light variations of a same short text. Some word forms depend on the speaker's gender, some can be replaced with synonyms.</p>  <p>Pseudo code:</p>  <pre><code>I {random:decided|made up my mind} to {random:try|test|give a try to} this {new|fresh} {cool|awesome} {service|web service|online tool}. </code></pre>  <p>I'm looking for an "industry standard" templating language to describe such texts and possible variations. Thinking further, I might want <em>global</em> variables (like the gender one), <em>cross-links</em> for dependencies picked earlier in the sentence.</p>  <p>This looks close to regular expressions syntax. Ideally it would be more readable/writable by non-programmers.</p>  <p>Perhaps the problem is well-known, with a solid state solution like some programming language specifically for the task?</p>
