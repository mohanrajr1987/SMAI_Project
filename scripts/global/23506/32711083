<p>I'm writing my first app in django.</p>  <p>I'm trying to display data from related models. I don't have problem when relation is based on simple foreign key relation. I don't know how to display data from models that are related through intermediate table that I also use as "dictionary".</p>  <p>Below is model that I wrote:</p>  <pre><code>    class SolrStage(models.Model):     solr_stage_name = models.CharField(max_length=200, verbose_name = "Solr stage name")     solr_vip = models.ForeignKey(SolrVip, verbose_name = "Solr's vIP")     solr_stage_port = models.IntegerField(default=8080, verbose_name = "Port")     solr_farm = models.ForeignKey(SolrFarm, verbose_name = "Part of Solr farm")     solr_ver = models.ForeignKey('SolrVer', verbose_name = "Solr version")     def __str__(self):         return self.solr_stage_name   class SolrComm(models.Model):         solr_comm_type = models.CharField(max_length=1, verbose_name = "Command type")     solr_command = models.CharField(max_length=200, verbose_name = "Command")     solr_ver = models.ForeignKey('SolrVer', verbose_name = "Solr version")     def __str__(self):         return self.solr_command  class SolrVer(models.Model):     solr_ver_name = models.CharField(max_length=20, verbose_name = "Solr's Version")     def __str__(self):         return self.solr_ver_name </code></pre>  <p>I want to display details of solr stage with command relation on solr version and I don't know how can I manage that with django ORM. Can You give me any clue how can I make it?</p>
