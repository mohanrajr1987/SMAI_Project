<p>In the following code if the variable exist in the dictionary i want to save it, how to do this. This is the reason i wanted to convert <code>str</code> to variable in my previous question.</p>  <p>So the intention here is if there are n number of columns in the models, which i take in as a list and compare it with the request  json <code>di</code> in this case. if the variable is found then i want to assign it to company object and save it</p>  <p>models.py</p>  <pre><code>class Company(models.Model):   version = models.IntegerField()   old_comp =  models.CharField() </code></pre>  <p>views.py</p>  <pre><code>c= Company() li = ['version'] di = {'a':1,'version':2} for data in li:    if data in di:      c.data = di[data] //gives an error since data is unknown to c      c.save() </code></pre>
