<p>For the most part, Django's CreateView works fine for everything I need. However, I'd like to put an "Add Another" button next to every model select dropdown element across my application, like in the admin interface.</p>  <p>Is there a good way for me to modify the form created by CreateView to include this button?</p>  <p>I'm using Django 1.8 and django-crispy-forms.</p>  <p>UPDATE</p>  <p>I'd like to make the change happen somewhere before the template since I can currently use a very generic template to deal with all my models. I'd like to just use <code>{{ form }}</code> that way I don't have to define a new template for each model.</p>
