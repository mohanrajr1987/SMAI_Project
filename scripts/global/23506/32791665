<p>I am trying to do the following:</p>  <pre><code>class PurchaseCreate(CreateView):     template_name = "generic_create.html"     model = Purchase     form_class = PurchaseForm     try:         latest_tag = Purchase.objects.latest('tag').tag         print(latest_tag)         next_tag = latest_tag + 1     except:         next_tag = 1     initial = {'tag': next_tag} </code></pre>  <p>The "tag" field should start with a value that is + 1 of the previous value that has been entered. When I test it out in the Django API, it works fine. However, when called from the view, it works correctly the first time, but seems to get "stuck" returning that first value, even when new objects are created which should update the value.</p>  <p>In fact, the try/except portion is never executed after the first page load, as the print order never shows up in the terminal, even with a hard browser refresh. How do I set this view to send an updated result every time the page is loaded?</p>
