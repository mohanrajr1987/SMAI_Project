<p>I have a Book model with a weeks_list field that stores multiple dates as strings in a list:</p>  <pre><code>['2015-09-15', '2015-09-27'] </code></pre>  <p>In my <code>views.py</code> file I want to be able to, given a start date and end date (in the same format) filter books to be only ones that have at least one of their dates in the <code>weeks_list</code> field to be in between the given values.</p>  <p>e.g. if a book has the <code>weeks_list</code> field of:</p>  <pre><code>['2015-09-15', '2015-09-27'] </code></pre>  <p>Then if I have <code>start_date = 2015-09-10</code> and <code>end_date = 2015-09-16</code> that book is accepted. Same with if s<code>tart_date = 2015-09-16</code> and <code>end_date = 2015-09-28</code>.</p>  <p>I can do something like this:</p>  <pre><code>allbooks = Book.objects.filter(Q(weeks_list__contains=start_date)|Q(weeks_list__contains='2015-09-27')) </code></pre>  <p>And if I could somehow loop it to have a Q object for all dates between the start and end dates that would work. Is that possible?</p>  <p>I know there's greater than/less than filters but from examples I've looked at that would work on a singular value in a field and not a list of values.</p>  <p>EDIT: I've also tried this: </p>  <pre><code>allbooks = Book.objects.all() q=Q(weeks_list__contains='2015-09-12') q = q.add((Q(weeks_list__contains='2015-09-15')), q.connector) allbooks = allbooks.filter(q) </code></pre>  <p>But it doesn't work. Is it possible to make the third line an "or" statement? </p>  <p>This is the model:</p>  <pre><code>class Book(models.Model): title = models.CharField(max_length=200) author = models.CharField(max_length=200) rating = models.CharField(max_length=5) genre = models.CharField(max_length=200) NYT_image_url = models.CharField(max_length=200) GR_image_url = models.CharField(max_length=200) isbns = models.TextField(max_length=600) weekly_rank = models.TextField(max_length=1000) weeks_list = models.TextField(max_length=1000) goodreads_ID = models.CharField(max_length=25) goodreads_URL = models.CharField(max_length = 100) NYT_description = models.TextField(max_length = 500) </code></pre>  <p>EDIT2: I found a solution, I should have used q.or instead of q.connector. Not sure how to mark this as solved.</p>
