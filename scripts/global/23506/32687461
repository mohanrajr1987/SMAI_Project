<p>I am trying to create a private messaging system using Django.  It doesn't have to be like a live chat, just have an inbox and be able to respond, simple thing like that.  So far, from research I have found two things: django.contrib.messages which doesn't seem to be for private messages, but rather messages from the system to a user.  Then I also found django-postman which seems to be what I'm looking for, but there seems to be little documentation on how to use it.  So has anybody used anything else to accomplish this?  Or am I wrong about django.contrib.messaging? Or is there good documentation on django-postman that I'm missing?</p>
