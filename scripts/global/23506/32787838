<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7763115/django-passing-data-between-views">This</a> questions addresses my question genearally, but I am looking for a more specific explanation. </p>  <p>I would like a user to update a a group of model objects, however, the queryset for these objects will need to be retrieved first. My plan is to do this in two seperate URs/views, getting the query set info from the first, then displaying the model formset to be updated next. </p>  <p>My first view gives a list of all the the "Project"s (One of my models), and retrieves the id of the project selected. </p>  <p>Here is the form:</p>  <pre><code>class ProjectLookupForm(forms.Form):     Project_Name = chosenforms.ChosenModelChoiceField(queryset=Project.objects.all()) </code></pre>  <p>and here is the view:</p>  <pre><code>def update_project_filter(request):     project_form = ProjectLookupForm(request.POST or None)     if request.method == 'POST':         if project_form.is_valid():             context = {"project_form":project_form}             # Get project here and share it with the next view.             selected_project_id = project_form.cleaned_data["Project_Name"].id             # Add a new return statement here?             # Or call update project view from here?             # Add a redirect button to html?         else:             errors = project_form.errors             context = {"errors":errors, "project_form":project_form}     else:         context = {"project_form":project_form}     return render(request, 'filter_update_project_form.html', context) </code></pre>  <p>As one can see, I have included some comments brainstorming what my possibilities are. My goal is to send the selected_project_id to this next view, so that it can use that id as a model form query set. </p>  <pre><code>def update_project(request):     UpdateFormset = modelformset_factory(Sample, fields=("sample_name", "extraction_date",                                                       "project", "order", "notebook", "notebook_page"))     if request.method == 'POST':         formset = UpdateFormset(request.POST, request.FILES)         if formset.is_valid():             formset.save()             context = {"formset": formset, "project_form":project_form}         else:             errors = formset.errors             context = {"formset":formset, "errors":errors, "project_form":project_form}     else:         formset = UpdateFormset(queryset=Sample.objects.filter(project=2))         context = {"formset":formset, "project_form":project_form}     return render(request, 'update_project_form.html', context) </code></pre>  <p>One can see here that I have hard coded the queryset like so:</p>  <pre><code>queryset=Sample.objects.filter(project=2) </code></pre>  <p>How can I set "project=" to my selected_project_id? Do I pass this info to the view as an input parameter? Or do I send it to the next URL and take it from there?</p>
