<p>In my model I define a Thoughts and Comments model. One thought has many Comments as so:</p>  <pre><code>class Thoughts(models.Model):     name = models.CharField(max_length=30)     thought = models.CharField(max_length=500)  class Comments(models.Model):     name = models.CharField(max_length=30)     comment = models.CharField(max_length=200)     original_post = models.ForeignKey(Thoughts, default=0) </code></pre>  <p>On my site, when you go to view a thought, I want all of the comments to appear. It is my understanding that you can use choice_set to access attributes via one-to-many relationship. Here's my view:</p>  <pre><code>def thought(request, thought_num):         if request.method == 'POST':             form = CommentForm(request.POST)             if form.is_valid():             c = Comments.objects.create(name=form.cleaned_data['name'],                 comment=form.cleaned_data['comment'])             c.save()     else:         form = CommentForm()      get_post = Thoughts.objects.get(pk=thought_num)     comments = get_post.choice_set.all()     return render(request, 'thought.html', {'form': form, 'comment':comments,}) </code></pre>  <p>In these lines, I attempt to access all comments related to a particular thought in order to print them in my template.</p>  <pre><code>    get_post = Thoughts.objects.get(pk=thought_num)     comments = get_post.choice_set.all() </code></pre>  <p>When I access the page that should display the comments, I get this error:</p>  <pre><code>Exception Type: AttributeError Exception Value:'Thoughts' object has no attribute 'choice_set' </code></pre>  <p>Perhaps I am missing something, I am not sure. I'm sure it's something simple. Thanks for your time</p>
