<p>I'm trying to use the django-user-accounts app to authenticate the users of my django project.</p>  <p>When I access the admin of the site, I can see the accounts managing part, however I can't access its creation, like a normal user would do.</p>  <p>I followed the tutorial that can be found at: <a href="https://django-user-accounts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html#installation" rel="nofollow">https://django-user-accounts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html#installation</a></p>  <p>I am also using the recommended templates from "pinax-theme-bootstrap"</p>  <p>I have no clue why it's not working. When I try to access it at localhost/account it shows me this message:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Using the URLconf defined in mysite.urls, Django tried these URL patterns, in this order:<br>       ^polls/<br>       ^admin/<br>       ^account/signup/$ [name='account_signup'] ^account/        The current URL, account, didn't match any of these.</p> </blockquote>  <p>This is the code of my URLs file:</p>  <pre><code>from django.conf.urls import patterns,include, url from django.contrib import admin from networks.views import SignupView  import networks.views  urlpatterns = [     url(r'^polls/', include('polls.urls', namespace="polls")),     url(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),     url(r"^account/signup/$", SignupView.as_view(), name="account_signup"),     url(r"^account/", include("account.urls")), ] </code></pre>  <p>account/urls.py:</p>  <pre><code>from __future__ import unicode_literals  from django.conf.urls import patterns, url  from account.views import SignupView, LoginView, LogoutView, DeleteView from account.views import ConfirmEmailView from account.views import ChangePasswordView, PasswordResetView, PasswordResetTokenView from account.views import SettingsView   urlpatterns = patterns(     "",     url(r"^signup/$", SignupView.as_view(), name="account_signup"),     url(r"^login/$", LoginView.as_view(), name="account_login"),     url(r"^logout/$", LogoutView.as_view(), name="account_logout"),     url(r"^confirm_email/(?P&lt;key&gt;\w+)/$", ConfirmEmailView.as_view(), name="account_confirm_email"),     url(r"^password/$", ChangePasswordView.as_view(), name="account_password"),     url(r"^password/reset/$", PasswordResetView.as_view(), name="account_password_reset"),     url(r"^password/reset/(?P&lt;uidb36&gt;[0-9A-Za-z]+)-(?P&lt;token&gt;.+)/$", PasswordResetTokenView.as_view(), name="account_password_reset_token"),     url(r"^settings/$", SettingsView.as_view(), name="account_settings"),     url(r"^delete/$", DeleteView.as_view(), name="account_delete"), ) </code></pre>  <p>I also don't know what can be causing this, I thought it would be because of the app installation but it's not the case, otherwise I wouldn't be able to manage the accounts...</p>  <p>I appreciate your help.</p>
