<p>I have following apps:</p>  <pre><code>├── events ├── files ├── pictures ├── posts ├── thoughts └── videos </code></pre>  <p>Here events, files, pictures, thoughts, videos all come under the category of <strong>posts</strong>. Now I want to achieve a single endpoint to handle saving/retrieval of all types of posts mentioned. For that I will receive all incoming requests in <strong>posts/views.py</strong> and the call views of the desired app based on the type of post.</p>  <p>I cannot merge the different kinds of posts into one as each kind of post has different attributes and models and I want to make them pluggable.</p>  <p>In Django each view must return a HTTPResponse, so how can I call views.py of files,videos etc and then return the response from posts itself.</p>
