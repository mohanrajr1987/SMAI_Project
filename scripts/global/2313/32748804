<p>First time question asker, so hopefully I'll do this right. Anyway, I'm writing a function in R which will take a list as one of its arguments. Specifically, the list needs to be of the form </p>  <pre><code>list(c(x1,y1),c(x2,y2),...) </code></pre>  <p>in other words a list of 2-element vectors representing Cartesian points. I'd like to do some error handling to detect whether a supplied list has that form. Any advice is appreciated. For example:</p>  <pre><code>test &lt;- function(points, ...){     if( test for format goes here){         return("Error: Invalid points list format")     }     main content } </code></pre>  <p>The points should be a list of arbitrary length, with each list element being a 2-element numeric vector.</p>
