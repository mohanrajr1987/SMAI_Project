<p>I am blank with perl. I have a task to convert script from Perl to PowerShell. So requesting you to be kind with your answers. I read about command line argument of Perl @ARGV. I understand that at the time of perl script execution any argument is passed will captured by this special array variable in Perl. We can read @ARGV and assign values to scalar variable using below</p>  <pre><code>($var1,$var2) = @ARGV; </code></pre>  <p>I need to understand what below statement is doing</p>  <pre><code>($var1,$var2,@ARGV) = @ARGV; </code></pre>  <p>In my perl script we have If condition on values in @ARGV and based on @ARGV values respective subroutine is getting called.</p>  <p>As per my understanding if we have more than two values in @ARGV then on left side in parenthesis statement is changing values of ARGV/used to rewrite @ARGV with remaining Values?</p>  <p>Please help me to understand this with a simple example.</p>  <p>Thanks Ravi</p>
