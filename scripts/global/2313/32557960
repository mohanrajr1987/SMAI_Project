<p>I have a shell script which I want to call from within gradle.  The shell script takes optarg like arguments which have to passed to the command line with -P arguments of gradle but I have been unable to think of a better way to do this.</p>  <p>My script is called as below: </p>  <pre><code>./script.ksh -a arg1 -b arg2 </code></pre>  <p>My gradle task looks like below</p>  <pre><code>task Build(type: Exec ) {         workingDir rootProject.projectDir.path         executable rootProject.projectDir.path + "/script.ksh" } </code></pre>  <p>I have tried using "args" but couldn't get this working.</p>  <p>What I am looking for is trying to pass these arguments to gradle in the below format</p>  <pre><code>gradle build ARG1 ARG2 </code></pre>
