<p>I'm working on an application that opens a file extension. The first thing I do is check the file path that was opened. This piece of code works perfectly on some PC's but refuses to work properly on another PC running Windows 7.  Here's the code:</p>  <pre><code>if (args.Length &gt; 0) {     if (!args[0].EndsWith(".myext1") &amp;&amp; !args[0].EndsWith(".myext2"))     {         MessageBox.Show("error.");         Application.Exit();     }  }  else  {      MessageBox.Show("Select File.");      OpenFileDialog open = new OpenFileDialog();      if (open.ShowDialog() == DialogResult.OK)          this.FilePath = open.FileName;   } </code></pre>  <p>In this case, it goest directly to the 'else' statement, i.e., there's no arguments.</p>  <p>As I said, this code works perfectly on most cases, so my question is, what could  be causing that this computer running windows 7 sends absolutely no arguments when oppened by a double click?</p>
