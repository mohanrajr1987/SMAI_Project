<p>I'm passing a lot data around; specifically, I'm trying to pass the output of a function into a class and the output contains a tuple with three variables. I can't directly pass the output from my function (the tuple) into the class as in the input parameters.  </p>  <p>How can format the tuple so it is accepted by the class without <code>input_tuple[0], input_tuple[1], input_tuple[2]</code>? </p>  <p>Here is a simple example:</p>  <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python  class InputStuff(object):      def __init__(self, a, b, c):         self.a = a         self.b = b         self.c = c   input_tuple = (1, 2, 3) instance_1 = InputStuff(input_tuple)  # Traceback (most recent call last): #   File "Untitled 3.py", line 7, in &lt;module&gt; #     instance_1 = InputStuff(input_tuple) # TypeError: __init__() takes exactly 4 arguments (2 given)  InputStuff(1, 2, 3) # This works </code></pre>
