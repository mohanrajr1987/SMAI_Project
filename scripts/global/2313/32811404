<p>I am creating a text based game maze type game and I cannot figure out how to end the argument if given the wrong answer. Any help is greatly appreciated. A little chunk of my code will be posted to understand what I mean. If the player types in the number 2 instead of 1 for the the first input and the game reads it as wrong i want the game to end making them start over</p>  <p>EDIT: I forgot to clarify I am writing in Python</p>  <pre><code>def chosenTurn1():     turn = ''     while turn!='1' and turn!= '2':       print('You are approaching your first turn')       print('Which way will you go?')       turn = input()       print()     return turn  def checkTurn1(chosenTurn):     print('the walls are shaking')     time.sleep(1)     print('the floor starts to break')     time.sleep(1)     print('.........................')     time.sleep(2)     friendlyTurn = (1)     if chosenTurn == str(1):      print('You are on the right track, lets keep going')      print()     else:      print('You fell in a pit')      print()      return main   def main():          turnNumber = chosenTurn1()          checkTurn1(turnNumber)  main() </code></pre>
