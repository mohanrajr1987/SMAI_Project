<p>This is for homework, so I don't want to post code or have someone do it for me. I'm an intro java student.</p>  <p>I created a Parser class that essentially verifies the format for an input. The assignment wants me to accept any number of inputs. I chose to do this with a do while loop. So at the beginning before the loop I declare my variables (including Parser parser; ). Then I proceed into my do while and ask the user for an expression, store it as a string called sentence, and then initialize the parser as parser = new Parse(sentence). At the end of the main method I ask the user if they would like to check another sentence to see if it's syntactically valid.</p>  <p>However when I iterate through a second time, obviously I can't initialize this as = new Parse because it's not new the second time around! But I can't initialize it before the do while loop because otherwise the sentence would be empty. The parser was given to me in pseudocode and I can't change how it functions.</p>  <p>Thanks for your help!</p>
