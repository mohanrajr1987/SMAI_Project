<p>I'm trying to implement a search in a django sqlite db.</p>  <p>I get a list of unknown length of params which should all be matched with a 'LIKE'. This means I want all objects that match at least one of the params.</p>  <p>As I can see from the django docs I can reach this by using the Q object.</p>  <p>Example:</p>  <pre><code>Students.objects.get(     Q(name_contains='franz') |      Q(birthdate_date=date(2005, 5, 2) |      Q(param3_contains='lorem' ) </code></pre>  <p>Now my question is, how can I handle it to join all the Q objects created from params to pass as arguments to the objects.get(). I could not find any on this.</p>  <p>Another issue here is to handle several different Field Lookup types.</p>  <p>I appreciate any advice, help or helping links you can give. Thank you.</p>
