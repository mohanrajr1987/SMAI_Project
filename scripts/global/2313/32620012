<p>Let's say in <code>file1</code> I have random number of words per line, Is there a way for <code>while read</code> to know for each line how many of them is supposed to read, here I have hardcoded three:</p>  <pre><code>while read w1 w2 w3 do     # grep [some regex] file2 done &lt;&lt;&lt; $(awk '{print $0}' file1) </code></pre>  <p>But wondering if it would be possible to have something like:</p>  <pre><code>while read [*words] #as many as they are for the current line I am getting from awk     ...     ... done &lt;&lt;&lt; $(awk '{print $0}' file1) </code></pre>  <p>Is that possible, without writing more complex script in a separate file, but running directly from terminal?</p>
