<p>I'm trying to get a script to retrieve a page header from an array using a string index, which works fine when calling directly, but for some reason, does not work when called through a URL argument using $_GET. This is what I'm currently trying to get the title with:</p>  <pre><code>Kelvin Shadewing - &lt;?php echo $pageitem[$_GET["id"]]["title"]; ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>And the array with the headers is this:</p>  <pre><code>$pageitem = array(   "home" =&gt; array("title" =&gt; "Home", "content" =&gt; "home.php"),   "contact" =&gt; array("title" =&gt; "Contact", "content" =&gt; "contact.php") ) </code></pre>  <p>The stuff involving content works just fine, so ignore that part. I've tried different ways of getting the header to show up right, even concatenating quotation marks around $_GET, but nothing seems to work. Does anyone have any ideas?</p>
