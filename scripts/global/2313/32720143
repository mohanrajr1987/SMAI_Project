<p>I'm using ruby 2.1.5p273, Rails 4.2.3 but have upgraded from much older versions recently. </p>  <p>I'm getting a "ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (1 for 0)" error on this line from the <strong>Phone</strong> model: </p>  <pre><code>Phone.all(:joins =&gt; :phone_page, :conditions =&gt; [query, condition_values], :order =&gt; "date") </code></pre>  <p><strong>query</strong> and <strong>condition_values</strong> are present. </p>  <p>Can anyone see what I'm doing wrong here? Is there upgraded syntax that should be used here instead? Thanks!</p>
