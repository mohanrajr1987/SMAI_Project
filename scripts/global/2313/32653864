<p>Presume we have a block in the code somewhere and we assign it to a variable (either instance or local) like this.</p>  <pre><code>someName := [ anInstanceVariable doThis. anotherInstanceVariable doThat.]  </code></pre>  <p>From the outside I would like to use it this way:</p>  <pre><code>someName someMessageTheBlockDoesntImplement: argument. </code></pre>  <p>Would it be possible for the block to act on the specific selector <code>someName</code> and have <code>anInstanceVariable</code> or <code>anotherInstanceVariable</code> perform it and return those objects respectively?</p>  <p>PS. It would act as a kind of forwarder of sorts.</p>
