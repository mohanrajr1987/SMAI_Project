<p>I am trying to create a texture (in a 3-D byte array) that is a coloured gabor patch. I am using OpenTK to map the texture. The texture mapping is working fine, but the texture that is created by my code below is not what I need.</p>  <p>The code I have come up with is as follows:</p>  <pre><code>for (int x = 0; x &lt; size; x++)                 {                     for (int y = 0; y &lt; size; y++)                     {                         double sin_term = 0.5*(double)Math.Sin(10 * 3.14159 * ((double)x / (double)size));                         sin_term += 0.5;                         double gauss = 0.5+Math.Exp(-((Math.Pow(x,2)+Math.Pow(y,2))/(2*Math.Pow(sigma,2))));                         double gabor = sin_term * gauss;                         byteTexture2[j,i,0] = (byte)(((double)Colour.R * gabor));                         byteTexture2[j,i,1] = (byte)(((double)Colour.G * gabor));                         byteTexture2[j,i,2] = (byte)(((double)Colour.B * gabor));                     }                 } </code></pre>  <p>My maths isn't alll that good, so I may be off track but I was trying to multiply the sine wave by the gaussian. The sine wave term seems to work OK by itself but the gaussian may be where it is having problems.</p>  <p>Any help would be much appreciated.</p>  <p>Have found MATLAB code for this problem but no c/c++/c# code</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
