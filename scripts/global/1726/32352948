<p>I am using the package shaddedErrorBar (<a href="http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/26311-shadederrorbar" rel="nofollow">http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/26311-shadederrorbar</a>) in order to plot physiological data with a shadded error bar. ;) </p>  <p>I managed of course to change the color myself, but unfortunately I do not know how to change the texture of the shadded bar. </p>  <p>Does anyone have a clue how to do that? </p>  <p>Thanks a lot! </p>  <p>Here the code component for blocking: </p>  <pre><code>`A=shadedErrorBar(x,y,e,'k',1)` `x  =  contains the x-values y = contains the y-values e= contains the respective standard errors of the mean  'k' =&gt; color  1 =&gt; sets transparency settings ` </code></pre>  <p>Best wishes,  Ferdinand</p>
