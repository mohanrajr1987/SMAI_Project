<p>I get an image from my server and I set it as a texture to a Gameobject. But what I also want to do is to save it in my project as a png. Any idea how am I supposed to do that ? I am new to unity. </p>  <p>Here is how I fetch my image and set it as a texture:</p>  <pre><code>WWW wB = new WWW ("http://xxx.xxxx.xxxx"); yield return wB; cube.GetComponent&lt;Renderer&gt;().material.mainTexture = wB.texture; </code></pre>  <p>I would like to save wb.Texture as a png.</p>
