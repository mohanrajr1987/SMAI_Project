<p>I want to render two textures side by side. And then consider such combination of these two textures as one sprite to use a single camera. I am able to render two textures side by side using SpriteBatch. How do I make the combination of these two textures into a single sprite and use camera to get different views?</p>  <p>Currently after I drew two textures with SpriteBatch, I'm trying to draw such SpriteBatch with a sprite. But I'm getting nullpointer when calling sprite.draw().</p>  <p>My ultimate goal is to render two images side by side to use as a background, and be able to use a camera on my background. Any ideas? THX</p>  <p>My current code:</p>  <pre><code>public void create () {     batch = new SpriteBatch();     //create two texture for 1.jpg and 2.jpg     //use batch to draw them separately at different position     img_1 = new Texture("1.jpg");      img_2 = new Texture("2.jpg");       mWorld = new Sprite();     mWorld.setPosition(0, 0);     mWorld.setSize(WORLD_WIDTH,WORLD_HEIGHT);     float aspectRatio = (float)Gdx.graphics.getHeight() / (float)Gdx.graphics.getWidth();     camera = new OrthographicCamera(VIEWPORT_WIDTH, VIEWPORT_WIDTH * aspectRatio);     camera.position.set(camera.viewportWidth / 2f, camera.viewportHeight / 2f, 0);     camera.update(); }  @Override public void render () {     batch.setProjectionMatrix(camera.combined);     batch.begin();     batch.draw(this.img_1, 0, 0, WORLD_WIDTH/2, WORLD_HEIGHT);     batch.draw(this.img_2, WORLD_WIDTH/2, 0, WORLD_WIDTH/2, WORLD_HEIGHT);      //getting java nullpointer exception here     mWorld.draw(batch);     batch.end(); } </code></pre>
