<p>I exported an avatar from Make Human (version 1.0 alpha 6), imported it on Blender (v2.75) and then exported it to three.js(r71). Now I am trying to display the avatar using webgl, but the texture of brows, eyes and eyelashes are weird (textures were not loaded properly) and I don't know what the problem is (see avatar image below). How to fix this problem?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/soQCk.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/soQCk.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
