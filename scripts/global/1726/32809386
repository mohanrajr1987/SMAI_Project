<p>After subtracting Box with the ThreeCSG.js file my texture doesn't load properly. Instead the geometry's surface turns black.</p>  <pre><code>        var geometry1 = new THREE.BoxGeometry(70, 35, 2);         var material1 = new THREE.MeshPhongMaterial({         map : THREE.ImageUtils.loadTexture("myTexture.jpg"),          side: THREE.DoubleSide});             var board = new THREE.Mesh(geometry1);          board.rotation.x = -1.57;         board.position.y = 1;          var board_bsp = new ThreeBSP(board);         var cutgeo = p.cylinder;         var substract_bsp = new ThreeBSP(cutgeo);         var subtract_bsp = board_bsp.subtract(substract_bsp);          var board = subtract_bsp.toMesh();         board.receiveShadow = true;         board.castShadow = true;             board.material = material1;         scene.add(board); </code></pre>  <p>After adding my board in the scene its texture is black.</p>  <p>What shall I do?</p>
