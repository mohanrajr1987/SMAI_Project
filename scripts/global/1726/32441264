<p>at the moment, I am rendering a camera to a texture and put the texture on a plane mesh. This works, in the scene the texture was recorded from.</p>  <p>When putting the same mesh into a different scene, which is running in a div, the mesh shows up, without texture. Same, when I put the texture on a mesh, which is created in the div- scene.</p>  <p>The mesh seems to have a texture, because it is black and not red, as initialized. When leaving away the texture, it does show up in red.</p>  <p>When I put the mesh into both scenes, which is the main scene and the div-scene, the mesh only shows in the main scene, the camera takes its shots from, regardless which one addad first into "its" scene.</p>  <p>Please be so kind and tell me, how I can use this texture, in a different scene.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
