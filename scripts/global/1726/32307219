<p>Since yesterday I have been experiencing some odd behaviour on my PC.</p>  <p>Playing WoW, the screen did go black for a moment, then a 'Driver stopped working and was restarted' message popped up. </p>  <p>Icons for some spells glitched out however, in the screenshot they appear black but were more like a glitchy mess: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/1SGz5.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/1SGz5.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a>. This happened a couple more times.</p>  <p>Then the screen just began flickering like mad and had to force a shutdown.  Looked like this:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/PIN5l.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/PIN5l.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>After reboot, playing WoW screen flickered a few times and then just went blank. A static-ish 'RRRRRR' sound came from the speakers and had to force shutdown.</p>  <p>This happened with a Radeon HD 7750 on Windows 10, with the latest drivers. Today I ran a few tests with my spare HD 7450. Running a WoW flight path caused the screen to flicker and textures to get corrupted, BUT no driver error! Instead WoW reported a problem but did not crash.</p>  <p>After that I ran FurMark, GPU load was at 99% for around 15 minutes with no glitching at all.</p>  <p>Here is the interesting part. I wanted to test CPU as well, to do that I used JamSoftware HeavyLoad. The software offers an option to stress GPU as well. Screen had no glitching, however this happened... <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/wOzso.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/wOzso.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>A texture error! I tried to search for that message but with no results. Isn't it weird that both WoW and a benchmark tool are both having problems with textures on TWO different video cards?</p>  <p>A friend of mine suggested PSU might be at fault here, what do you think?</p>  <p>UPDATE: Disabled Catalyst AI, nothing changed.</p>  <p>UPDATE 2: Made a clean driver reinstall, using benchmarks on 7750 triggered video glitches and eventually this BSOD message: THREAD_STUCK_IN_DEVICE_DRIVER <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/aqZOI.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/aqZOI.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
