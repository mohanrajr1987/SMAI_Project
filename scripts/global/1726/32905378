<p>I want to make a programm with Unity that shows in split screen on the left side the .jpg or .png image and on the right side the compressed image (ETC or DXT).</p>  <p>I was trying to solve it like this:</p>  <pre><code>void CompressImage() {     original_image = new Texture2D(Screen.height, Screen.width, TextureFormat.ASTC_RGBA_12x12, false);     GetComponent&lt;Renderer&gt;().material.mainTexture = original_image; }  public void OnGUI() {     GUI.DrawTexture(new Rect(0, 0, original_image.height, original_image.width), original_image); }  </code></pre>  <p>Am I doing the compression the right way? When I try do show the compressed image there is no image to see but some random colors.</p>  <p>I am new to this and it would be nice if someone could help me with this. Thank you</p>
