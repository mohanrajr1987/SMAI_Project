<p>When using the simulator for the iphone6 plus, the images that loads from an atlas, load at @2x~iphone, instead of the @3x~iphone. When I load an image (not using the atlas) the @3x~iphone works.</p>  <p>I'm using one atlas, which contains both @2x~iphone and @3x~iphone images (only loads @2x~iphone images). I read online to change the atlas folder name to @2x.atlas and @3x.atlas, but then an error comes up saying it cannot find the folder. I also changed the file name to @2x~iphone.atlas and @3x~iphone.atlas, but got the same error.</p>  <p>This is what I use to load the images to an array.</p>  <pre><code>func build_ArrayTextureSegment() {      for var i = 0; i &lt;= 12; i++ {         let texture:SKTexture = SKTextureAtlas(named: "Segments").textureNamed("\(i)")         arrayTextureSegments.append(texture)     }  } </code></pre>  <p>my image names are "imagename"@2x~iphone.png and "image name"@3x~iphone.png. And the folder name is Segments.atlas.</p>  <p>Can anybody tell me why the @3x~iphone images are not loading?</p>
