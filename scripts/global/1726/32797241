<p>I want to create a tooltip box, with a texture, which is technically a rounded rectangle, with a slightly brighter border. I want to make this tooltip be able to be scaled.</p>  <p>I could do this by cutting a image of a rounded rectangle into 8 pieces, and fill the inside, depending on how big it is with a colored quad.</p>  <p>But is there a way to handle this better? It should not scale the border, so it does'nt look different everytime.</p>
