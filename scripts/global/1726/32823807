<p>I am making a 2d game engine in OpenGL and c#. I got 2d lights to work. now, i wanted to optimize and saw that rendering the lights on 1 big quad was faster. So i made an fbo, render both the scene and the lights to a texture. This works. Now i want to blend these to textures on a big quad. The shader:</p>  <pre><code>#version 330  in vec4 color; in vec2 texcoord; in vec2 vp;  out vec4 fragColor;  uniform sampler2D tex1; uniform sampler2D tex2;  void main() {     fragColor = texture(tex1, texcoord) * texture(tex2, texcoord); } </code></pre>  <p>then i render using this shader:</p>  <pre><code>GL.BindTexture(TextureTarget.Texture2D, 0);         texture = 0;          core.ClearData();         core.AddSprite(0, 0, width, height);         core.SetData();          shader_merge.SetInt("tex1", 0);         shader_merge.SetInt("tex2", 1);         shader_merge.SetVariable("screen_size_half", width / 2, height / 2);          Shader.Bind(shader_merge);          GL.ActiveTexture(TextureUnit.Texture0);         GL.BindTexture(TextureTarget.Texture2D, tex_light_static);         GL.ActiveTexture(TextureUnit.Texture1);         GL.BindTexture(TextureTarget.Texture2D, tex_scene);          core.Render(); </code></pre>  <p>My render code is very long and big, but i render all sprites in a batch in 1 drawcall  with a VAO and a VBO. this all works. I can render the lights correctly if i apply the lights on each quad i draw, but that is slower. </p>  <p>for an image of the result that is correct using the "slow" method: <a href="http://ocdy1001.blogspot.nl/" rel="nofollow">http://ocdy1001.blogspot.nl/</a> (last post)</p>  <p>now the shader works(the lights look differnt, but i think i know why), but only the first frame! i have 2 textures, 1 is the lightmap, 2 is the scene. now for the next frames, it draws the quads in the scene using the lightmap texture, and then applies the lightmap again. if i draw tex_scene or tex_light_static without the rendercode for the merge shader, everything is correct, but if i use the new render code(second code block in this question), it changes both textures! the lightmap gets split and mirrored, and the scene texture becomes some kind of lightmap. </p>  <p>recap: -lights work in shader that renders the sprites with the lighting -now lights and the scene gets rendered to there own texture. -if i blend them using the shader, it works but the first frame, but then it start changing the textures i feed the shader...</p>  <p>anyone who can help me?</p>
