<p>I am playing with a 2d side scroller and I didn't think it would be too difficult to run through a sequence of images to look like the sprite is running. For some reason my animation sequence is not running. How do I correct this or is there an easier way?</p>  <pre><code>var runActionWait = SKAction.waitForDuration(1) var runAction1 = SKAction(sprite.texture = SKTexture(imageNamed: "spriteRun1.png")) var runAction2 = SKAction(sprite.texture = SKTexture(imageNamed: "spriteRun2.png")) var runAction3 = SKAction(sprite.texture = SKTexture(imageNamed: "spriteRun3.png"))  var fullRunAction = SKAction.repeatActionForever(SKAction.sequence([runAction1, runActionWait, runAction2, runActionWait, runAction3, runActionWait]))  sprite.runAction(fullRunAction) </code></pre>
