<p>I using the texture atlas in my project, and it works well. But when I try to using the filtering, there has a problem is the coordinate is not exact. <br><br><strong>For example:</strong><br> My big texture UV coordinate is {[0,0]->[1,1]}, and i pick a tile is {[0.2, 0.2]->[0.5, 0.5]}, when i render i open the linear filter, and the filter will get the neighbor coordinate, so maybe will the [0.19, 0.19] to compute will my tile edge coordinate. <br>Of course i have the border for my texture atlas, but i don't want the neighbor coordinate to be compute together, i want to have a edge, not mater what i do, the compute edge always [0.2, 0.2] -> [0.5, 0.5], it won't offset my coordinate range.<br><br> <strong>Problem 2:</strong><br> When i using the tile texture{UV: [0.2, 0.2] -> [0.5, 0.5]} to do the Gaussian Blur effect, and i will need to pick the texture pixel offset, maybe is 8 pixel,  so also i will get the out of my want edge( [0.2, 0.2] -> [0.5, 0.5]), maybe will get more{ [0.1, 0.1] -> [0.6, 0.6]}. <br> <strong><br>So i very confuse for this, is that have good way to solve this problem?</strong></p>
