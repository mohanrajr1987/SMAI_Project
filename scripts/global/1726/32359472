<p>What I want to do is to create a texture based on the RGB values of one surface, and the alpha of another.</p>  <p>In the context of my program, I have two sprite-sheets, one with the colors and textures I want to use, and one containing the corresponding masks. The reason for having them in two separate files is so that I can mix and match different textures to different masks to get any combination I want.</p>  <p>I've tried creating a new surface which I copy the texture onto, then the mask and apply a colorkey to, which is then rendered, however I found this to be extremely slow - I need to perform this action several times every frame.</p>  <p>I would really appreciate any tips or advice anyone can give!</p>
