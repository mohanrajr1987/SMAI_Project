<p>When I filter image with the texture.setFilter(linear, linear), it gets filtered perfectly. But when I put it in a textureatlas, the filter is worse and i can still see pixelation.</p>  <p>I tried the approach below, which didnt work</p>  <pre><code>Sprite sprite = atlas.createSprite("image"); sprite.getTexture().setFilter(linear, linear); // pseudo code image = sprite; </code></pre>  <p>I also tried to edit the .pack file to set filter to: (which didn't work either)</p>  <pre><code>filter: Linear, Linear </code></pre>  <p>Please suggest reasons for these to fail?</p>
