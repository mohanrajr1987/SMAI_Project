<p>I am planning to convert a large amount of XSD documents to Ruby classes and it is very tiresome to do it by hand. I would like to find an automated way of doing this instead. </p>  <p>I have found a gem called rxsd (<a href="https://github.com/movitto/RXSD" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/movitto/RXSD</a>) but it does not quite work (it only generates empty classes). However, it does have some infrastructure that might be worth building on.</p>  <p>We are currently using libxml for parsing the schema files which is documented here <a href="https://xml4r.github.io/libxml-ruby/rdoc/" rel="nofollow">https://xml4r.github.io/libxml-ruby/rdoc/</a></p>  <p>Any suggestions? Has anyone had to do this before?</p>
