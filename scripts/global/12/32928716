<p>I am working on creating a Rails web application with background worker for performing some of the tasks on the background and on a set interval. I am using Resque gem with Redis for queuing the background jobs, and using Resque-scheduler to run it on set interval for ex., every 30 seconds or so. </p>  <p>Background job need to be enqueued only when a user visits a particular page and it should run on a schedule from there on until users move away from that page. Basically I would like to set the schedule dynamically during runtime. My application is deployed in Cloud, and the main rails app and the background workers runs as a separate process and communicating through the redis. How can I set the schedule dynamically , and from where?</p>  <p><em>resque_schedule.yml</em></p>  <pre><code>do_my_job:   every: 1m   class: BackgroundJob   description: Runs the perform method in MyJob   queue: backgroundq </code></pre>  <p><strong><em>inside the controller</em></strong></p>  <pre><code>  def index     Resque.enqueue(BackgroundJob)   end </code></pre>  <p><strong><em>background_job.rb</em></strong></p>  <pre><code>class BackgroundJob   @queue = :backgroundq    @job_helper = BackgroundHelper.new    def self.perform     @job_helper.get_job_data   end  end </code></pre>
