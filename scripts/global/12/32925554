<p>I will try to explain:</p>  <p>I have a table 'Product' and a table 'Store'. I'm trying to get just the store name to show at the page, but ActiveRecord is returning me all the columns from the store.</p>  <p>Here is the code:</p>  <pre><code>@product = Product           .order(id: :desc)           .includes(:store)           .select("products.id, products.store_id, stores.name")           .limit(1) </code></pre>  <p>The built query (from Rails):</p>  <pre><code>Processing by IndexController#index as HTML Product Load (0.0ms)  SELECT  products.id, products.store_id FROM `products`  ORDER BY `products`.`id` DESC LIMIT 1 Store Load (1.0ms)  SELECT `stores`.* FROM `stores` WHERE `stores`.`id` IN (111) </code></pre>  <p>I just want to show the product's store name, but Rails is selecting all the store columns.</p>  <p>Any ideia?</p>
