<p>I have a rails website, and the models will cause some backend service.  I have a rescue_from StandardError in the ApplicationController, which can capture rails exception, but cannot capture exceptions from the backend service.</p>  <p>ApplicationController:</p>  <pre><code>class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base   rescue_from StandardError do |exception|    # do something  end end </code></pre>  <p>Actual controller:</p>  <pre><code>class StatementsController &lt; ApplicationController    def show     # get statement     respond_to :js   end end </code></pre>  <p>If I do "raise 'error message'" inside the show method, then the ApplicationController's rescue method can capture this error. But if the get statement encounters a service exception from the backend service, then the ApplicationController cannot catch it. However, if I do</p>  <pre><code>class StatementsController &lt; ApplicationController    def show     # get statement     respond_to :js      rescue StandardError =&gt; e         # Don't even need to write code here           end end </code></pre>  <p>Then the applicationController can catch the java exception.  I am very new to rails. Can someone help me with this? Thanks</p>
