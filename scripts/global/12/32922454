<p>In my website (written with sinatra) I am trying to set up a database. I have 2 tables, here referred to as Table1 and Table2.</p>  <p>models.rb</p>  <pre><code>class Table1 &lt; ActiveRecord::Base     Table1.where(bool:true) has_one :table2 # PSUDO-CODE     # So that every record where bool:true has the relationship     # but every record where bool:false or bool:nil doesn't end class Table2 &lt; ActiveRecord::Base     belongs_to :table1 end </code></pre>  <p>I am trying to find a way to make the section labeled <code>PSUDO-CODE</code> into actual code. How can I do that?</p>
