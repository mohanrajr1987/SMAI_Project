<p>I have multiple components which all need to do the same thing. (A simple function which maps over their child components and does something to each one). At the moment I am defining this method in each of the components. But I only want to define it once. </p>  <p>I could define it in the top level component and then pass it down as a prop. But that doesn't feel quite right. It is more a library function than a prop. (It seems to me).</p>  <p>What is the correct way of doing this?</p>
