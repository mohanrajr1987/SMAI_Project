<p>I'm using some CSS Animations in my React app, but I'm having issues with only some of the nodes animating because the rest are not being rerendered, but rather are being recycled in the render function. Because of this they don't show the CSS animation as expected. Is there any way to force React to re-render the nodes instead of reusing them?</p>
