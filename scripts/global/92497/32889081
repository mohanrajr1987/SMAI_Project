<p>I'd like to achieve what is described here: <a href="http://idevrecipes.com/2010/12/16/raised-center-tab-bar-button/" rel="nofollow">http://idevrecipes.com/2010/12/16/raised-center-tab-bar-button/</a></p>  <p>Essentially given a tab bar, I'd like the center button to be larger than the others.</p>  <p>Can this be achieved somehow using react-native ? Bonus points if it's a crossplatform solution.</p>
