<p>I am new to react. I am using React Route and I would like to know if it's possible to execute a different handlers based on a slug passed to the route.</p>  <p>For example I have the following route:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;Route name="page" path={'/:slug'} /&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Is it possible to dynamically set the handler to be executed based on that slug?</p>  <p>I couldn't find anything on their API/Examples.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
