<p>As far as I understand, you can pass a component to another in at least two ways.</p>  <p>As children:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;ParentComponent&gt;&lt;ChildComponent /&gt;&lt;/ParentComponent&gt; </code></pre>  <p>As a prop:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;ParentComponent prop1={&lt;ChildComponent /&gt;}/&gt; </code></pre>  <p>A lot of the examples I see seem to use the first instance, but is there any difference or preferred community method? Is one less efficient than the other? </p>  <p>The second example seems more explicit as you can break child components down into separate props, making them easier to reason about within the parent component.  It also means one less thing to learn/teach if props can just be used instead.</p>
