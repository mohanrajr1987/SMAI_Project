<p>I am working on application using Alt and was trying to setup tests based on <a href="https://github.com/jdlehman/alt-example-tests" rel="nofollow">jdelhman's example here</a>. I tried to setup the tests in exactly the same way but in jspm/karma/jasmine setup, but wasn't able to make them pass. Then, I copied pasted the exact code from that repo and tried to run the tests in my setup but surprisingly even they didn't work. I have setup a repository with the test on github <a href="https://github.com/jabhishek/alt-es6-tests-example" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>  <p>Probably I am doing something stupid, but I have spend hours on this and couldn't find the problem. I would appreciate any help on this.</p>  <p>Thanks, Abhi.</p>
