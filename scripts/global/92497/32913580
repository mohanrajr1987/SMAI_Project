<p>I use React in my project. I have a large list to be rendered and I try to use react-list for this.</p>  <p>But on Macs, I have a bug that can be best described by the video: <a href="https://youtu.be/tRR0EIifrX4" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/tRR0EIifrX4</a></p>  <p>It happens in Chrome, Mac OS X. When a cursor is over a scrollbar (or when I scroll by dragging a slider instead of using trackpad or mouse), there is no problem. But if it somewhere over a list (as you can see in the video), strange things happening.</p>  <p>This is how I create ReactList:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;ReactList itemRenderer={this.renderItem} length={this.state.friends.length} type="uniform" /&gt;; </code></pre>  <p>It happens with <code>type="variable"</code> as well.</p>  <p>Any hint of how to fix it is highly appreciated.</p>
