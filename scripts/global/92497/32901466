<p>I am using <code>react</code>, <code>redux</code> and <code>react-router</code>. One of my page is making an API request and showing the data. It works fine. What I want to know is, if the API request is not yet finished, and the user navigates to another route, I want to be able to abort the request.</p>  <p>I am assuming I should dispatch some action in the <code>componentWillUnmount</code>. Just not able to understand how will it work. Something like...</p>  <pre><code>componentWillUnmount() {     this.props.dispatch(Actions.abortRequest()); } </code></pre>  <p>And I'll store the <code>xhr</code> reference somewhere in the action. Not sure if this is the correct approach or not (I think not), can someone point me in the right direction?</p>
