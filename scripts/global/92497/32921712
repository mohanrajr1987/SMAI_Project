<p>I have been trying to center a PickerIOS, but I am probably missing the underlying logic behind a Picker, because I just want its width to be full screen. </p>  <p>I can manage to do that with iPhone 4s / 5s, but when I run it on the iPhone 6, the Picker seems to be on the left, with some space on the right side. </p>  <p>I have been trying to use alignItem:'center' with a wrapper around the picker, but that just makes it disappear. I have also tried alignSelf, but still doesn't work. </p>  <p>I thought that Picker, by default, had its width to full screen or does it adapt according to the length of the elements? </p>  <p>Do I have to place it in a Flexbox in order to get it centered with a full screen width? </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/RPt8o.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/RPt8o.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/qP2Q1.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/qP2Q1.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <pre><code>mask1: { height:120, overflow:'hidden', justifyContent:'space-around', marginTop:50 } </code></pre>
