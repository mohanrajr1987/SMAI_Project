<p>I am interested in learning web app/site development. I did it as a hobby over 15 years ago, and for awhile now have been wanting to learn it again, obviously the webs much different now. I have been dealing with medical issues that have sidelined me and will continue to for at least the next 6 months, so this is the perfect time for me to learn it. I was surprised how quickly I picked up html and css, but I never learned JS when younger. I did some reading beforehand and my plan for now was to learn about node(&amp; express), angular, and I am interested in react (sass as well). </p>  <p>However I didnt want to try and skip plain JS, so its what I have been learning, through books and video. I would say I know the basics so far, functions, objects, arrays, conditionals, loops. I would next likely move into object oriented JS and maybe functional JS. My question is how much JS should you know before trying to move into angular?</p>  <p>I looked in the archives and didnt see this answered though Im sure its probably in there. Thanks so much, Nick</p>
