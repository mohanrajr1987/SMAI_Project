<p>I'm working through the Haskell wikibook section on <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Denotational_semantics" rel="nofollow">denotational semantics</a> and I'm kind of stuck on this exercise:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Prove that the fixed point obtained by fixed point iteration starting   with <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/A1pS6.gif" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/A1pS6.gif" alt=""></a> is also the least one, that it is smaller than any other   fixed point. (Hint: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/NuhAc.gif" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/NuhAc.gif" alt=""></a> is the least element of our cpo and g is   monotone).</p> </blockquote>  <p>Where the following statements define the core of the concepts leading up to the exercise (I think):</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/eAsVI.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/eAsVI.png" alt=""></a></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/BfFQC.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/BfFQC.png" alt=""></a></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Eu2yE.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Eu2yE.png" alt=""></a></p>  <p>where f is the factorial function and is shown to be the fixed-point of g, given that g is continuous.</p>  <p>I think I basically understand the part where it is shown that g(f) = f but I don't really know what to make of the exercise. From what I understand, the factorial function f is the least-fixed point (with least based on the <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5JTFB.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5JTFB.png" alt=""></a> operator) but it's not at all clear to me what it means (intuitively) to compare functions with <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5JTFB.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5JTFB.png" alt=""></a>, let alone how I would find fixed points other than the least-fixed point shown in the example.</p>  <p>I understand that <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/NuhAc.gif" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/NuhAc.gif" alt=""></a> is less than everything else, and I understand that since g(x) is monotonic, if I apply it to two things, where one is less than the other, the results will still obey this ordering.</p>  <p>I think I would start the proof with taking some function f' and assuming <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/DN7Ms.gif" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/DN7Ms.gif" alt=""></a>. If that is the case, through the monotonic property of g I can show that <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/2XXlg.gif" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/2XXlg.gif" alt=""></a>. If I can then show that necessarily g(f') = g(f) or f' = f I think the proof is complete but I have no idea how to show that. </p>
