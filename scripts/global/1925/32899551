<p>I have this list.</p>  <pre><code>xs = ["12", "1", "293", "1111"] </code></pre>  <p>I'd like this list to be converted to ints.</p>  <p>However, </p>  <pre><code>map read xs  </code></pre>  <p>raises </p>  <pre><code>[*** Exception: Prelude.read: no parse </code></pre>  <p>This works.</p>  <pre><code>map (\x -&gt; (read x) + 0) xs </code></pre>  <p>But the lambda's really ugly. How can I avoid raising this exception and getting read to work the way it's supposed to? Thank you!</p>
