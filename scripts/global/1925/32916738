<p>Starting from a previous question here: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32806125/reactive-banana-how-to-use-values-from-a-remote-api-and-merge-them-in-the-event">Reactive Banana: how to use values from a remote API and merge them in the event stream</a></p>  <p>I have a bit different problem now: How can I use the <code>Behaviour</code> output as input for an IO operation and finally display the IO operation's result?</p>  <p>Below is the code from the previous answer changed with a second output:</p>  <pre><code>import System.Random  type RemoteValue = Int  -- generate a random value within [0, 10) getRemoteApiValue :: IO RemoteValue getRemoteApiValue = (`mod` 10) &lt;$&gt; randomIO  getAnotherRemoteApiValue :: AppState -&gt; IO RemoteValue getAnotherRemoteApiValue state = (`mod` 10) &lt;$&gt; randomIO + count state  data AppState = AppState { count :: Int } deriving Show  transformState :: RemoteValue -&gt; AppState -&gt; AppState transformState v (AppState x) = AppState $ x + v  main :: IO () main = start $ do     f        &lt;- frame [text := "AppState"]     myButton &lt;- button f [text := "Go"]     output   &lt;- staticText f []     output2  &lt;- staticText f []      set f [layout := minsize (sz 300 200)                    $ margin 10                    $ column 5 [widget myButton, widget output, widget output2]]      let networkDescription :: forall t. Frameworks t =&gt; Moment t ()         networkDescription = do               ebt &lt;- event0 myButton command            remoteValueB &lt;- fromPoll getRemoteApiValue           myRemoteValue &lt;- changes remoteValueB            let             events = transformState &lt;$&gt; remoteValueB &lt;@ ebt              coreOfTheApp :: Behavior t AppState             coreOfTheApp = accumB (AppState 0) events            sink output [text :== show &lt;$&gt; coreOfTheApp]             sink output2 [text :== show &lt;$&gt; reactimate ( getAnotherRemoteApiValue &lt;@&gt; coreOfTheApp)]       network &lt;- compile networkDescription         actuate network </code></pre>  <p>As you can see what I am trying to do it is using the new state of the application -> <code>getAnotherRemoteApiValue</code> -> show. But it doesn't work.</p>  <p>Is actually possible doing that?</p>
