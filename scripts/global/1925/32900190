<p>Recently I've been writing a lot of scripts in Haskell. It's quite an enjoyable experience as it is one of the most concise languages I've ever touched.</p>  <p>One thing that bothers me a lot though, is that I have to type in the same <code>import</code>s for every script I write, and there's a set of modules I use almost everytime, like</p>  <pre><code>import Control.Monad as MO import Data.ByteString.Lazy as BS import Data.Char as CH import Data.Csv as C import Data.Csv.Streaming as CS import Data.Foldable as FOLD import Data.Functor as F import Data.List as L import Data.List.Split as LS import Data.Text.Lazy as T import Data.Text.Lazy.IO as TI import Data.Vector as V import Debug.Trace as TR import Prelude as P </code></pre>  <p>I mean I could copy and paste them every time, but is there a way I can make these tedious imports implicit? Just like how <code>Prelude</code> is imported implicitly?</p>
