<p>According to <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/All_About_Monads#The_Reader_monad" rel="nofollow">All about monads</a></p>  <blockquote>   <p>Monad values (of the Reader monad) are functions from the environment to a value. The bound   function is applied to the bound value, and both have access to the   shared environment.</p> </blockquote>  <p>But, why is it necessary to use a function (and not, for instance, two variables, one for the environment and one for the value) in this monad?</p>
