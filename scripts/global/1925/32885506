<p>I need to take the elements of a list and put them into two seperate lists of odd and evens in haskell. Here is what I have so far.</p>  <pre><code>classEvenOdd :: [Int] -&gt; ([Int], [Int]) classEvenOdd []     = ([] , []) classEvenOdd (x:xs) =  (even [xs] | odd [xs]) </code></pre>  <p>The error is as follows:</p>  <pre><code>ERROR "new_1.hs":62 - Type error in explicitly typed binding *** Term           : classEvenOdd *** Type           : [Int] -&gt; [a] *** Does not match : [Int] -&gt; ([Int],[Int]) </code></pre>
