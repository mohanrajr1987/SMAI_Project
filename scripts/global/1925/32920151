<p>I'm trying to show a web page inside my wxHaskell based application for Mac. I tried to use <code>HtmlWindow</code>, which very limited. According to the wxWidgets' documentation, I have to use wxWebView, which is capable to process CSS and JS.</p>  <p>From <a href="http://docs.wxwidgets.org/trunk/classwx_html_window.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.wxwidgets.org/trunk/classwx_html_window.html</a></p>  <blockquote>   <p>If you want complete HTML/CSS support as well as a Javascript engine, see instead wxWebView.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Exactly what I need! Hoverer I didn't find any mentions about wxWebView in wxHaskell. And, also, which is miracle, Google is pretty silent about it. That makes me think, that I do something wrong. Is there any way to display reach (having HTML/CSS/JS) pages using wxHaskell? How people do that?</p>  <p>I've got wxWidgets 3.0.2 installed from brew:</p>  <pre><code>brew install wxwidgets </code></pre>  <p>and wxHaskell 0.92 from cabal</p>  <pre><code>cabal install wx cabal install wxcore </code></pre>
