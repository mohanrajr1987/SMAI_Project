<p>I have an infinite list which I'm concatenating to a string.</p>  <pre><code>foldl1 (++) $ map show [1..] </code></pre>  <p>What I'd like is to cut this string off when it has reached a length of ten characters or more.</p>  <p>However, takeWhile operates on individual elements of the list. Is there a function I can use to cut the list off when it's greater than ten characters?</p>  <p>In this case, I'd want the function to output "123456789", ignoring the 10, because going over would result in too big a length.</p>  <p>Edit: Here is my actual code. This does what I was describing.</p>  <pre><code>succProd x = last. takeWhile ((&lt;10).length) . scanl1 (++) $ map (show.(x*)) [1..] </code></pre>  <p>Thank you!</p>
