<p>This is my solution which works, but there probably is a better way to write this.</p>  <p>Basically I have a list with 9 rows each containing 9 elements, representing a 9x9 sudoku as seen in the example. I want to tranform that list so that each row corresponds to the 3x3 blocks in a sudoku</p>  <p>How can I improve this?</p>  <pre><code>-- returns 9 rows that corresponds to the 3x3 blocks in a sudoku -- splits the list, transposes, concats, and then combines into 9 rows all3x3blocks :: [Block] -&gt; [Block]  all3x3blocks b = combineList (concat (transpose (splitList b)))  -- splits up each of the 9 rows into 3 parts with 3 elements in each splitList :: [Block] -&gt; [[Block]] splitList b = [mySplit 3 x | x &lt;- b ]  -- splits a list into n sized lists mySplit :: Int -&gt; Block -&gt; [Block] mySplit _ [] = [] mySplit n list = firstSplit : (mySplit n rest)   where     (firstSplit,rest) = splitAt n list  -- combines a split row, by combining 3 parts into 1 row with 9 elements combineList :: [Block] -&gt; [Block] combineList [] = [] combineList list = concat(split) : combineList rest     where (split, rest) = splitAt 3 list  type Block = [Maybe Int]  example :: [Block] example =     [ [Just 3, Just 6, Nothing,Nothing,Just 7, Just 1, Just 2, Nothing,Nothing]     , [Nothing,Just 5, Nothing,Nothing,Nothing,Nothing,Just 1, Just 8, Nothing]     , [Nothing,Nothing,Just 9, Just 2, Nothing,Just 4, Just 7, Nothing,Nothing]     , [Nothing,Nothing,Nothing,Nothing,Just 1, Just 3, Nothing,Just 2, Just 8]     , [Just 4, Nothing,Nothing,Just 5, Nothing,Just 2, Nothing,Nothing,Just 9]     , [Just 2, Just 7, Nothing,Just 4, Just 6, Nothing,Nothing,Nothing,Nothing]     , [Nothing,Nothing,Just 5, Just 3, Nothing,Just 8, Just 9, Nothing,Nothing]     , [Nothing,Just 8, Just 3, Nothing,Nothing,Nothing,Nothing,Just 6, Nothing]     , [Nothing,Nothing,Just 7, Just 6, Just 9, Nothing,Nothing,Just 4, Just 3]     ]  -- Desired outcome after transformation [[Just 3,Just 6,Nothing,Nothing,Just 5,Nothing,Nothing,Nothing,Just 9] ,[Nothing,Nothing,Nothing,Just 4,Nothing,Nothing,Just 2,Just 7,Nothing] ,[Nothing,Nothing,Just 5,Nothing,Just 8,Just 3,Nothing,Nothing,Just 7] ,[Nothing,Just 7,Just 1,Nothing,Nothing,Nothing,Just 2,Nothing,Just 4] ,[Nothing,Just 1,Just 3,Just 5,Nothing,Just 2,Just 4,Just 6,Nothing] ,[Just 3,Nothing,Just 8,Nothing,Nothing,Nothing,Just 6,Just 9,Nothing] ,[Just 2,Nothing,Nothing,Just 1,Just 8,Nothing,Just 7,Nothing,Nothing] ,[Nothing,Just 2,Just 8,Nothing,Nothing,Just 9,Nothing,Nothing,Nothing] ,[Just 9,Nothing,Nothing,Nothing,Just 6,Nothing,Nothing,Just 4,Just 3]] </code></pre>
