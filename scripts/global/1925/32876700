<p>I am trying to read the documentation in  <a href="https://github.com/ekmett">Edward Kmett</a>'s <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-4.13/docs/Control-Lens.html">Lens</a> package.  I am not familiar with a lot of the terms used (profunctor, isomorphism, monomorphic, contravariant, bifunctor, etc...)</p>  <p>What would be a good resource to go to learn some of this vocabulary as it is used in this library. </p>
