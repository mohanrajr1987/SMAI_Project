<p>For example, I want to get <code>"abc"</code> from <code>"aabbccabc"</code>, which should be easy with regex. But i want to use parsec. seems that <code>try</code> can do that, but that must be quite inefficent..</p>  <p>Tried:     import Text.ParserCombinators.Parsec     ps pser txt = case (parse pser  "" txt ) of       Left e  -> show e       Right v -> v</p>  <p>result:</p>  <pre><code>Î»&gt; ps (string "asf") "  dsfdsasf" "(line 1, column 1):\nunexpected \" \"\nexpecting \"asf\"" </code></pre>
