<p>I want to display my saved data as a power point presentation(i.e. a slide is created for the data). I was successful in displaying the saved data in excel and in word. But, didn't find anything for displaying data as a powerpoint presentation. Has anyone tried it. Please help if anyone did.</p>  <p>Thanks,</p>
