<p>I have another question relating to MS MVC 4, I have used some very simple JavaScript to run once the page has been unloaded. This was basically to see if the code would work. The value is getting changed in the DB, but I only want this to happen once the user leaves the site, and not every time the page is unloaded. I searched for a couple of terms that I thought might fit the bill, but no dice. Can someone tell me if this is possible? Here is the code I have written:</p>  <pre><code>        window.onbeforeunload = function () {         var xmlhttp;         if (window.XMLHttpRequest) {             xmlhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();         }         else {             xmlhttp = new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP");         }         xmlhttp.onreadystatechange = function () {             if (xmlhttp.readyState === 4 &amp;&amp; xmlhttp.status === 200) {                 alert(xmlhttp.responseText);             }         }         var value = 'isOnline=false';         xmlhttp.open("GET", "/Home/_changeUserStatusToOffline/" + value, true);         xmlhttp.send();      } </code></pre>  <p>Also, is there anyway to keep someone from accessing this functionality? In other words, I only want the script to have access to this url and not the user. As always, I am grateful for any help. </p>  <p>Mike</p>
