<p>I am following this tutorial: <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/aspnet/mvc_models.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.w3schools.com/aspnet/mvc_models.asp</a>, to get data from SQL CE using Entity Framework. There doesn't seem to be much code. The tutorial is for MVC3 but my app is MVC4, but I think major steps should be same.</p>  <p>I created a SQL CE database, and a table with needed columns.  Added data to the table.  On the C# side I have</p>  <pre><code>namespace MvcDemoApp.Models {     public class Employee     {         public int EmployeeID { get; set; }         public string Name { get; set; }         public string Gender { get; set; }         public string City { get; set; }      }      public class EmployeeContext : DbContext     {         public DbSet&lt;Employee&gt; employees { get; set; }     } } </code></pre>  <p>And code in respective controller</p>  <pre><code> public ActionResult Index()  {             var c = db.employees.ToList();             return View(c);  } </code></pre>  <p>That sample is for movies database, I changed all relevant info to employees. I added the connection string as in that tutorial too. But when I navigate to the Index page of above controller, the empty list is returned. What did I miss?</p>  <p>It seems I gave correct meaning to table columns too (e.g. similar to Employee class properties)</p>  <p>PS. This is how the DB looks after I stop running the app <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/75XSn.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/75XSn.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
