<p>That's how I built my website in the web form and I want to build it on MVC and I have ssl by CloudFlare, but I would like to have a subdomain used for only MVC.</p>  <p>How can I build it up so that I make an MVC site which will be the new part so it must be a folder for himself as my website does not go down but matter to show the new system to the other.</p>
