<p>How do I persist <a href="http://getglimpse.com/" rel="nofollow">Glimpse</a> (for MVC4) information for historical purposes? For example, I would like to store specific dashboard data items (e.g., time on the wire) a database, per request, so as to create a chart based on that. I have searched all over the docs and forums for something like this, but I have not found anything really useful for setting up this use case.</p>  <p>This question may be related to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16198195/how-glimpse-persists-debugging-information">How glimpse persists debugging information?</a>. It suggests implementing <a href="https://github.com/Glimpse/Glimpse/blob/739afdba40e61ea31b42e6d0ddfbeed8f9c561be/source/Glimpse.Core/Extensibility/IDataStore.cs" rel="nofollow">IDataStore</a> However, if go down this route, how do I actually reference my interface implementation so my Glimpse installation will use it?</p>
