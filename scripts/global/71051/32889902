<p>I am new to mvc, so am still struggling with some concepts. I have a very simple form and controller.  Controller:</p>  <pre><code>    public class InquiryController : BaseController {      public ActionResult Index() {          return View();     }      public ActionResult Search(int Id) {           int newid = Id;          return View();      } } </code></pre>  <p>and the form:</p>  <pre><code>@using (Html.BeginForm("Index", "Results", FormMethod.Post)) {     @Html.TextBox("id", null, new { type = "Search", autofocus = "true", style = "width: 200px" })     &lt;input type="submit" value="Search" /&gt; } </code></pre>  <p>What is happening is that when I enter a number in the form, I want that number to be passed to the "Search" function in the controller. I do not understand how to get the form to call the controller and do its processing inside that controller. Instead, it goes to an error looking for the "results" page, which i understand comes from the BeginForm method. So in essence, how can i get my form to pass the number entered into the search box to my controller function?</p>
