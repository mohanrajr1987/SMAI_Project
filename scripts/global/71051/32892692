<p>I'm trying to find a possible easy solution for this issue. All the solutions found in web are not working for me. I have in my model a price field which can be a decimal value like 30,5 using comma. But the validation returns me an error "The 'field' must be a number".</p>  <p>I'm using the default validation used in MVC that I suppose it is using jQuery. Is there any way to avoid this issue?</p>  <p>The model code is:</p>  <pre><code> [Range(0.0, Double.MaxValue, ErrorMessage = "Out of range")]     [DataType(DataType.Currency)]     public decimal Price { get; set; } </code></pre>
