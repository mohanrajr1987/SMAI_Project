<p>I'm having problems with the Required error message being displayed when on a form submit.</p>  <p>My view model has the following property,</p>  <pre><code>[Required(ErrorMessage = "Type Required")] public bool? IncludeType { get; set; } </code></pre>  <p>And in my view I have ,</p>  <pre><code>@Html.LabelFor(model =&gt; model.IncludeType) @Html.RadioButtonFor(m =&gt; m.IncludeType, "true")Saving @Html.RadioButtonFor(m =&gt; m.IncludeType, "false")Waste @Html.RadioButtonFor(m =&gt; m.IncludeType, "")Both //This causes the error when selected @Html.ValidationMessageFor(model =&gt; model.IncludeType) </code></pre>  <p>My problem is when I submit the form with the 'Both' radio button selected on postback I get the field validation error "Type Required" displayed, despite the view being updated by the controller appropriately.</p>  <p>I have tried passing <code>string.Empty</code> instead of <code>""</code> for the 'Both' Radio button, and I have also changed the properties of the viewmodel to  both</p>  <pre><code>[Required(ErrorMessage = "Type Required", AllowEmptyStrings = true)]  [DisplayFormat(ConvertEmptyStringToNull = false)] </code></pre>  <p>But I still have the error message displayed, I don't understand why this is happening, as I am using a <code>bool?</code> type. What I can do to stop this happening? Thanks.</p>
