<p>I am learning the basics of .NET, using the MVC model. It seems simple enough, except for connecting my models to a local database, where I have been having nothing but trouble. </p>  <p>Whatever I screwed up, I don't seem to be able to connect my project (or any other projects) to my database using connection strings, and when I try to Add>New Item> SQL Server Database I get an error: </p>  <pre><code>A network-related or instance-specific error occurred while establishing a connection to SQL Server. The server was not found or was not accessible. Verify that the instance name is correct and that SQL Server is configured to allow remote connections. (provider: SQL Network Interfaces, error: 50 - Local Database Runtime error occurred. The specified LocalDB instance does not exist.) </code></pre>  <p>Unfortunately, this problem has been hard to diagnose, as I am mostly unfamiliar with Windows Server.</p>  <p>Right now, I have only one model in my application "GetQuestions" </p>  <p>Here are my connection strings:</p>  <pre><code> &lt;connectionStrings&gt;     &lt;add name="DefaultConnection" connectionString="Data Source=(localdb)\v11.0;AttachDbFilename=C:\Users\{{myusername}}\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Microsoft SQL Server Local DB\Instances\v11.0\master.mdf;Initial Catalog=GetQuestions;Integrated Security=True"       providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" /&gt;     &lt;add name="QuestionsDBContext" connectionString="Data Source=(localdb)\v11.0;;AttachDbFilename=C:\Users\{{myusername}}\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Microsoft SQL Server Local DB\Instances\v11.0\master.mdf;Integrated Security=True"       providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" /&gt;   &lt;/connectionStrings&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I'm hoping that this is simply a noob mistake which can easily fix. I have looked at several general walkthroughs but nothing seems to work.</p>  <p>I have screenshots of my Server Explorer and Server Object Explorer that can probably help diagnose this problem, but Stackoverflow will not allow me to post them.</p>
