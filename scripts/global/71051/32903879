<p>I have implemented Action filter attribute and have declared Globally using Global.asax.cs file. </p>  <p>For Example if I have created XYZ action filter attribute and in Global.asax.cs file declared like below:</p>  <pre><code>GlobalFilters.Filters.Add(new XYZ()); </code></pre>  <p>Using above code it applies to all action methods. Now I do not want this filter attribute for one method say ABC. Is there any way to do this?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
