<p>I have in the below parameters for all ajax calls in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of my document. (I need this for an iOS ajax bug at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/12856562/627473">http://stackoverflow.com/a/12856562/627473</a>)</p>  <pre><code>$.ajaxSetup ({             cache: false,             headers: { "cache-control": "no-cache" }         }); </code></pre>  <p>I have a service that I am communicating with the specifically denies the cache-control header in any way.</p>  <p>So I tried the below BEFORE making ajax request. </p>  <pre><code>$.ajaxSetup ({ cache: true, headers: { 'Invoke-Control': 'EMVX' } }); </code></pre>  <p>The above request still includes "cache-control": "no-cache" as a header. A requirement of the service I am making a request prohibits the cache-control header from being in the request (even if it is blank or has a cache value. </p>  <p>My request also includes the invoke-control (which I want); but I do NOT want cache-control to show up at all.</p>  <p>I even tried specifying headers in the $.post request by itself and it still merges the headers from $.ajaxSetup.</p>  <p>I am using jQuery v1.11.1. Is there a workaround?</p>
