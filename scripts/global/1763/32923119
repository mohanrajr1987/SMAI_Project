<p>Let's say there is a class A which has class B object. When I update class B through Mybatis(also using eh-cache). While getting class A object, the B's changes are not reflecting quickly. It takes time to reflect. But this inconsistency creates problem for me.</p>  <p>I suspect eh-caching is creating this inconsistency. Anyone has experienced this? Please help me to solve this.</p>  <p>Framework used: Spring + MyBatis + eh-cache for caching. </p>
