<p>I've been looking into ways to speed up my website.  One of the things I came across is output caching in IIS.  Can someone tell me the difference between user-mode and kernel-mode caching?  My webpages bring up data based on the user logged on.  When I turned both types of caching on for aspx, and I go to the website, if someone else then goes to the website, it brings up my stuff and not theirs.  If I turn off the caching, it again brings up their stuff.  I'm afraid to try just one or the other without first knowing what the difference is.  I searched and I cannot find anything that helps me understand it.  Thanks in advance!  I have IIS 6.1 and created my webpages using Visual Studio and vb.</p>
