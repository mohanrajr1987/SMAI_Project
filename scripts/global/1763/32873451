<p>Cloudfront is configured to cache the images from our app. I found that the images were evicted from the cache really quickly. Since the images are generated dynamically on the fly, this is pretty intense for our server. In order to solve the issue I set up a testcase.</p>  <h3>Origin headers</h3>  <p>The image is served from our origin server with correct <code>Last-Modified</code> and <code>Expires</code> headers.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/95keC.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/95keC.jpg" alt="origin headers"></a></p>  <h3>Cloudfront cache behaviour</h3>  <p>Since the site is HTTPS only I set the <code>Viewer Protocol Policy</code> to <code>HTTPS</code>. <code>Forward Headers</code> is set to <code>None</code> and <code>Object Caching</code> to <code>Use Origin Cache Headers</code>.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/aYw0G.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/aYw0G.jpg" alt="cloudfront cache behaviour settings"></a></p>  <h2>The initial image request</h2>  <p>I requested an image at 11:25:11. This returned the following status and headers:</p>  <ul> <li>Code:           200 (OK)</li> <li><p>Cached:         No</p></li> <li><p>Expires:        Thu, 29 Sep 2016 09:24:31 GMT</p></li> <li>Last-Modified:  Wed, 30 Sep 2015 09:24:31 GMT</li> <li>X-Cache:        Miss from cloudfront</li> </ul>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/IisMK.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/IisMK.jpg" alt="initial request headers"></a></p>  <h2>A subsequent request</h2>  <p>A reload a little while later (11:25:43) returned the image with:</p>  <ul> <li>Code:           304 (Not Modified)</li> <li><p>Cached:         Yes</p></li> <li><p>Expires:        Thu, 29 Sep 2016 09:24:31 GMT</p></li> <li>X-Cache:        Hit from cloudfront</li> </ul>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/SD3JX.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/SD3JX.jpg" alt="subsequent request headers"></a></p>  <h2>A request a few hours later</h2>  <p>Nearly three hours later (at 14:16:11) I went to the same page and the image loaded with:</p>  <ul> <li>Code:           200 (OK)</li> <li><p>Cached:         Yes</p></li> <li><p>Expires:        Thu, 29 Sep 2016 09:24:31 GMT</p></li> <li>Last-Modified:  Wed, 30 Sep 2015 09:24:31 GMT</li> <li>X-Cache:        Miss from cloud front</li> </ul>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/x9fFB.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/x9fFB.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Since the image was still cached by the browser it loaded quickly. But I cannot understand how the Cloudfront could not return the cached image. Therefor the app had to generate the image again.</p>  <p>I read that Cloudfront evicts files from its cache after a few days of being inactive. This is not the case as demonstrated above. How could this be?</p>
