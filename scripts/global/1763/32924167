<p>I've developed a simple application that loads four mobile webviews side by side. On a fresh install the app fully opens and loads these pages in under 0.5 seconds. However if i minimize this app, for some reason its "cached background process" is over 200mbs! sometimes 250... Seems completely unnecessary as the app loads lightning fast on a fresh install</p>  <p>How can I clear this cache when the app is minimized (onbackpressed etc)</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/cANIN.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/cANIN.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
