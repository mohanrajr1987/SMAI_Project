<p>I am using the facebook sharer URL to share a website. I have filled in all the meta tags in my header, and when I check the Facebook's debugger (<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/" rel="nofollow">https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/</a>), I get the correct data as an example. Whenever I click the link below the example (See this in the share dialog.), I still get old information.</p>  <p>The information it shows is the reserved domainpage from the domain registrar. However, I changed its DNS to my VPS, and the website is up and running now. I have tried the ?fbrefresh parameter, but nothing seems to work.</p>  <p>It is weird that the 'debugger' shows the right information, and the live URL is showing the old.</p>  <p>It is about this URL: <a href="http://gotony.nl/" rel="nofollow">http://gotony.nl/</a></p>
