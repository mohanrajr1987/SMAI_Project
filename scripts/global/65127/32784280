<p>I was reading <a href="https://facundoolano.wordpress.com/2014/10/11/better-authentication-for-socket-io-no-query-strings/#comment-851" rel="nofollow">this</a> post and quoted below:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Yaki Klein says: 31/07/2015 at 07:01 </p>      <p>Thanks for this example. My question is why do you need to bother with using the underscore model. You can register the client to events only after they are authenticated and that way prevent them from sending or receiving data while they are not. (The client can send data but it will be ignored by socket-io engine)</p> </blockquote>  <p>This line specifically, "<em>You can register the client to events</em>". </p>  <p><strong>How does one achieve this?</strong></p>
