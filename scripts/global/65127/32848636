<p>I'm making an online whiteboard app with <code>socket.io</code> just for fun and learning and I'm trying to decide between these two options for the drawing tool:</p>  <p>1) Wait for around 20 points (or until mouseup) and send that points array all at once over the wire. The effect on the clients will be they will only see line paths updated every 20 or so points.</p>  <p>2) Send each point as soon as it is drawn as a packet. This will result in around 20x more packets being sent but the responsiveness will be immediate on all clients.</p>  <p>I'm not sure which option is better. I'm worried that if I do the second option that the server will be overburdened by all the point packets but ideally it would be better just because it would be so responsive and look so pretty but I'm unsure of how feasible it is considering the quantity of the packets required to be sent back and forth.</p>
