<p>I have a node.js server that's running on Heroku, and I'm in the middle of transitioning this application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk. </p>  <p>Mobile apps communicate with the node.js server through API requests &amp; also through socket.io. I can redirect all HTTP requests on Heroku to my AWS EB instance, but I'm not sure how to redirect any socket.io polling/connection requests. I'm not sure if it's possible to redirect socket.io polling requests, and if so, how to do it.</p>
