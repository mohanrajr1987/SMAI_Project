<p>Hi I'm writing a game with <code>node.js</code>, <code>socket.io</code>, and <code>canvas</code> and was wondering how to validate packets properly. I'm under the impression that users can use a packet injection program to send packets that the server isn't expecting. For example,</p>  <ul> <li>Send a packet with one of the parameters outside of normal bounds (x or y beyond game space)</li> <li>Send extremely large packets to overwhelm the server</li> <li>Send a packet with additional parameters the server is not expecting</li> <li>Send a packet with data that, when read, may execute commands on the server (escape characters?)</li> <li>Send the same packet over and over to overwhelm the server (DoS)</li> </ul>  <p>What are the typical measures taken to prevent such things? Are some of the bullets not an actually issue? Am I missing anything? Are there any libraries to assist in any of this?</p>
