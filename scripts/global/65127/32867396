<p>I'm looking to integrate socket.io with my angular app. I've seen some examples of how to create a service, which makes it accessible on the controller. Which I understand. But I'm looking for a way that all the controllers can react to event calls from socket.io. </p>  <p>So:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>socket.on('user joined', function (data) {});</p> </blockquote>  <p>I can do that in one controller but how do I do it for all?</p>
