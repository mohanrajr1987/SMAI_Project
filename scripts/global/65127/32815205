<p>I'm building an application in real time with socket.io</p>  <p>Each time the user enters the application creates a socket ID. So if I joining the application in several browser tabs generates me a socket id for each tab.</p>  <p>I generate a room for specific users and included my sockets id,  but I need to emit broadcast message except to my sockets id.</p>  <p>This code don't work for me because emit broadcast message but sends to my other id sockets</p>  <pre><code>socket.broadcast.to("room").emit('message', "somethings") </code></pre>  <p>Any ideas?</p>
