<p>right I'm trying to get my teeth into socket programming. I've got socket.io installed and iisnode for my iss 7.5 server. The server has basic auth for the development environment and windows authentication for the live.</p>  <p>All has been going well and I've got 2 browser effectively sending messages using this technology.</p>  <p>But I've now got a snag, I've got a php script that really should also send messages into the mix.</p>  <p>So I plumbed for elephant.io, and after a little kicking it is almost playing ball with sending messages my only problem is that in the version1x.php, the upgradeTransport function seems to return blank after stream_get_contents and there are no messages that are transmitted. For the 2 other clients that are javascript connected.</p>  <p>So there is a problem there and secondly how would I get this to work with windows-auth. In the past with traditional methods I've used CURL, could I just change </p>  <pre><code>"Authorization: Basic " . base64_encode("$username:$password") . "\r\n" </code></pre>  <p>To</p>  <pre><code>"Authorization: Windows" . base64_encode("$username:$password") . "\r\n" </code></pre>  <p>in the <code>stream_context_create</code> areas? if not is there another way.</p>  <p>Perhaps I'm looking at the wrong library altogether, is there anything better that fits my needs. I managed to get redis installed as a php module and I've read around but I'm not 100% sure how to get that working that way I want with the auth etc.</p>
