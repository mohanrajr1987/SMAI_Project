<p>I've created chat application based on <a href="https://github.com/tamaspiros/advanced-chat" rel="nofollow">this project</a> but what I want to do now is to have parser for smilies. For example, If I write something like:</p>  <pre><code>What's up? :) </code></pre>  <p>That can be parsed as <em>"What's up? [image here]"</em>. Also, when someone visits room, all messages from that room needs to be parsed too. What's the easiest way to do this?</p>  <p>P.S. App doesn't have database.</p>
