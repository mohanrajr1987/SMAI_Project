<p>I'm working nodejs webservice that uses socket io and mongo db.</p>  <p>I am currently in the testing phase and I am testing the sending of thousands of messages with thousands of socket io connections which causes mongo to crash. the error is crashes with is as follows:</p>  <pre><code> mongod(_ZN5mongo15printStackTraceERNSt3__113basic_ostreamIcNS0_11char_traitsIcEEEE+0x39) [0x10cbde939]  mongod(_ZN5mongo10logContextEPKc+0x100) [0x10cb92c80]  mongod(_ZN5mongo15invariantFailedEPKcS1_j+0x183) [0x10cb7ff53]  mongod(_ZN5mongo3dur13JournalWriter20_journalWriterThreadEv+0x8FC) [0x10c9ba2ac]  mongod(_ZN5boost12_GLOBAL__N_112thread_proxyEPv+0xB1) [0x10cc121b1]  libsystem_pthread.dylib(_pthread_body+0x8A) [0x7fff88c40899]  libsystem_pthread.dylib(_pthread_struct_init+0x0) [0x7fff88c4072a]  libsystem_pthread.dylib(thread_start+0xD) [0x7fff88c44fc9] -----  END BACKTRACE  ----- 2015-09-29T16:29:54.206+0100 I -        [journal writer]   ***aborting after invariant() failure </code></pre>  <p>I only have 3 connections to the database at any given time. So I don't think it's a connection overload issue. </p>  <p>I've noticed mongo crashes when it is under a lot of request load. Why does it crash? Should it not just add things to some processing queue?</p>  <p>How could I prevent this crashing. What techniques are there to managing this?</p>  <p>I think this may be due to hardware limitations. I was going to run this webservice on a raspberry pi. Guess I'll have to think twice before I do that.</p>
