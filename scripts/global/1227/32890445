<p>I need to collect data from multiple pages, resulting from a Google search query <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=gluten+free" rel="nofollow">https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=gluten+free</a> The XPath code //ol/div/div works great on a single page, but is it possible to get the data from several ones? What are the good XPath examples for 'Next' button?</p>  <p>Thanks! Grazie!</p>
