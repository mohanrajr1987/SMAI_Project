<p>I need to make foreach cycle in bpel and to take a parameter from a cycle-pivot node in XPath.  I execute FOREACH cycle on  elements and need to receive @Name parameter from every  in cycle separately (the process forms separate requests to the other system).  Unfortunately, the system I use to model my process (Intalio BPMN) offers quite strange graphical XPath editor without proper documentation. It is possible to edit a BPEL-result to fit goals, but we try to stay BPMN-only, so I need to explore other approaches that can be used in Intalio editor.</p>  <p>I`ve tried this approaches: 1.) (//node/@Name)[i] - in this case we cant fit the expression into round brackets via intalio editor. 2.) //node[i]/@Name - in this case we cant add "/@Name" after pasting the iteration id into the square brackets. </p>  <p>Are there any other ways to get the i-th attribute via XPath?</p>
