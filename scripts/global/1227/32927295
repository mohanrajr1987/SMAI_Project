<p>So I'm using Mechanize in Ruby to do some website scraping and want to find all nodes with a specific <code>style</code> attribute.</p>  <p>I want to return all nodes with a style attribute that has specific <code>top</code> value on the webpage. </p>  <p>The HTML will look like this:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div id="c11285" style="position:absolute;top:1px;left:333px;width:65px;height:226px;overflow:hidden;background-color:transparent;z-index:10;border: 1px solid #000" onclick=""&gt; </code></pre>  <p>In this case I cannot use the id, because each variation of the page has different ids so I want to search by the <code>top</code> value in the <code>style</code> attribute which in this case is <code>1px</code>.</p>  <p>I've tried using <code>webPage.search("div['style=top: 1px;']")</code> However, this does not work as <code>px</code> seems to cause an error.</p>  <p>Any suggestions on how I could achieve this or is this even possible?</p>
