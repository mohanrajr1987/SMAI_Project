<p>I have 100 combotree's on a page and it's taking forever to load since each new combotree that is made, the loadData function has to run. The data is always the same so is there a way to make this run only once to speed the page up?</p>  <p>Here is the documentation for a <a href="http://www.jeasyui.com/demo/main/index.php?plugin=ComboTree&amp;theme=default&amp;dir=ltr&amp;pitem=" rel="nofollow">combotree</a></p>  <p><code>for (var i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++) {     $("#tree" + i).combotree("loadData", data); }</code></p>  <p>Can I run the combotree function once then copy to the other elements?</p>
