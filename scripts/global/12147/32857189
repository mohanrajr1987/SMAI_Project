<p>I have an excel sheet with several values which I imported into SQL (book1$) and I want to transfer the values into ProcessList. Several rows have the same primary keys which is the ProcessID because the rows contain original and modified values, both of which I want to keep. How do I make SQL ignore the duplicate primary keys?</p>  <p>I tried the IGNORE_DUP_KEY = ON but for rows with duplicated primary key, only 1 the latest row shows up.</p>  <pre><code>CREATE TABLE dbo.ProcessList (     Edited              varchar(1),     ProcessId           int             NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY WITH (IGNORE_DUP_KEY = ON),     Name                varchar(30)     NOT NULL,     Amount              smallmoney      NOT NULL,     CreationDate        datetime        NOT NULL,     ModificationDate    datetime )  INSERT INTO ProcessList SELECT Edited, ProcessId, Name, Amount, CreationDate, ModificationDate FROM Book1$ SELECT * FROM ProcessList </code></pre>  <p>Also, if I have a row and I update the values of that row, is there any way to keep the original values of the row and insert a clone of that row below, with the updated values and creation/modification date updated automatically?</p>
