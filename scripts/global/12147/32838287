<p>I have to find duplicates in an Access table, where one field is different. I'll try to explain: assuming to have this data set</p>  <pre><code>ID  Country     CountryB        Customer  ==================================================== 1   Italy       Austria         James 2   Italy       Austria         James 3   USA         Austria         James </code></pre>  <p>I have to find all the records with duplicated CountryB and Customer, but with different Country. </p>  <p>For instance, with the data above, the ID 1 and 2 are <strong>NOT</strong> duplicated (as they are from the same Country), while 1 and 3 (or 2 and 3) are. The "best" query I got is the following one:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT COUNT(*),  CountryB, Customer FROM (SELECT MIN(ID) as MinID, Country, CountryB, Customer FROM myTable GROUP BY Country, CountryB, Customer) GROUP BY  CountryB, Customer HAVING COUNT(*)&gt;1 </code></pre>  <p>I'm not sure if this is the smartest option, anyhow. Furthermore, since I need to "mark" all the duplicates, I have to do something more, like this:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT ID, a.Country, a.CountryB, a.Customer FROM  myTable a INNER JOIN ( SELECT COUNT(*),  CountryB, Customer FROM (SELECT MIN(ID) as MinID, Country, CountryB, Customer FROM myTable GROUP BY Country, CountryB, Customer) GROUP BY  CountryB, Customer HAVING COUNT(*)&gt;1 ) dt ON a.Country=dt.Country and a.CountryB=dt.CountryB and a.Customer=dt.Customer </code></pre>  <p>Any suggestion this approach is greatly appreciated.</p>
