<p>How would you maintain duplicate phone numbers across both tables?  </p>  <p>In writing this, I realized why not separate the mobile phone number column into a separate table, and use foreign key constraints where the mobile phone number table stores the ph# and a key column that references the unique key in both the person and descendants key column.  That way I can create a constraint on the mobile phone number table to not store duplicates for the ph# column.</p>  <p>Is this the only possible solution or are there other ways to go about it?  I think this would be the preferred solution, correct?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
