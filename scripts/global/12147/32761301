<p>I notice that the image alt tag in the Magento frontend is not correct for a duplicated SKU.<br> It happens when I duplicate an SKU in Magento 1.9.2 backend. In that case, the img alt tags of the duplicated product images, are the same as the img alt tags from the original SKU.<br> It doesn't help when I change the images of the duplicated SKU.</p>  <p>Sounds familiar to anybody? Any suggestions on how to prevent or repair this?</p>
