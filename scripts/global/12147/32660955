<p>I am trying to consolidate duplicate data that looks like the following:</p>  <pre><code>  a b  c 1 1 1  1 2 2 2  2 3 1 1 NA 4 4 4  4 5 5 5 NA 6 2 2  2 </code></pre>  <p>In this case I want all distinct rows based on <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> and if multiple exist delete the one where <em>c</em> is <em>NA</em>. For example if I run the following:</p>  <pre><code>distinct(df,a,b,c) %&gt;% group_by(a,b) %&gt;% filter(!is.na(c)) </code></pre>  <p>I will get what I need except I lose row 5. If the group consist of only 1 row or all the entries in the group are NAs then I lose those records. I am not sure what else I can do to avoid this issue. The dummy dataset can be generated with the following line:</p>  <pre><code>df&lt;-data.frame(a=c(1,2,1,4,5,2),b=c(1,2,1,4,5,2),c=c(1,2,NA,4,NA,2)) </code></pre>
