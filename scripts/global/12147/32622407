<p>I have a situation where records are being duplicated and I don't know how to deal with it. Here is the LINQ statement:</p>  <pre><code>theData = (from urls in this.ObjectContext.Activities.AsExpandable()             .Where(predicateA)             .Where(r =&gt; (r.StartDate &gt;= beginDate &amp;&amp; r.StartDate &lt;= endDate) ||                   (r.EndDate &gt;= beginDate &amp;&amp; r.EndDate &lt;= endDate) ||                   (r.StartDate &lt;= beginDate &amp;&amp; r.EndDate &gt;= endDate))                 join idGroups in this.ObjectContext.IdentityGroups                      on urls.IdentityID equals idGroups.IdentityID                 join groupSup in this.ObjectContext.GroupSupervisors                     .Where(r =&gt; r.SupervisorID == loggedInID)                      on idGroups.GroupID equals groupSup.GroupID                 join programs in progs                      on urls.ProcessName.ToUpper() equals programs.ProcessName.ToUpper()              into jt             from jt1 in jt.DefaultIfEmpty()                 .Where(r =&gt; r == null || r.Ignore == false)             group urls by new                          { urls.ProcessName,                            urls.ContextID,                            jt1.CustomCategory,                            jt1.Name,                            groupSup.SupervisorID                          }              into groupedTable             select new ActivityInfoSummary_DTO             {                recId = Guid.NewGuid(),                Context = groupedTable.Key.ProcessName,                ContextId = groupedTable.Key.ContextID,                SupervisorId = groupedTable.Key.SupervisorID,                FocusCount = groupedTable.Sum(r =&gt; r.FocusCount),                many more fields....             }).ToList(); </code></pre>  <p>The dilemma is:  <code>urls.identityId</code> is the ID of the person who created the record. </p>  <p>The person creating the record can belong in more than one group</p>  <p>Each group has a single supervisor</p>  <p>Each supervisor can be the supervisor of multiple groups</p>  <p>A person can belong to multiple groups</p>  <p>The linq statements are trying to filter down the records created by a person based on the fact that the person is a member of a group the supervisor manages (supervisor ID is the loggedInID field in the groupSup filter).</p>  <p>If a person is a memberof of multiple groups the supervisor manges, the record is being reported multiple times and the numbers are being inflated.</p>  <p>That is one of my test cases :( My question is how do I restructure this so if the supervisor manages multiple groups, all the people reporting to them are recorded only once - so a person belonging to 2 or more groups managed by the same supervisor only has their data reported once?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!!</p>
