<p>I have a page that checks to see if Meta Tags have been submitted for products and categories.</p>  <p>Its shows at the top, those that are missing. But I need to also see if anything are duplicated - because you shouldn't really have two products with the same Titletag or Meta Description.</p>  <p>I already do it by extract ALL products Titletags and Meta Desc/Keywords, along with their titles.  But in theory, this is taking more work than in needs to over several hundred products, whereas I just want to find those where the Titletag, Meta Desc, or Meta Keywords are duplicated with at least one other.</p>  <p>How do I do that without running a Query to find all.  And then on each row, querying ALL again to check titletag, and then querying all to check for Meta Desc, and then querying all again to check for Keywords.</p>  <p>Is there a script where I can query a product, and ask if either of those three fields have duplicates anywhere else in the DB, without FOUR queries (three being embedded)?</p>
