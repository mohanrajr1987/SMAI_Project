<p>I have 4 MySQL tables on identity column is in common between all these tables,  Tables in Sequence: 1- Items. 2- Sales. 3- Puchases. 4- Returned.</p>  <p>ItemID appears in all of these tables, WHEN i use LEFT JOIN i get duplicates like: </p>  <pre><code>    select      a.ItemID AS ItemID,     a.Item_title AS ItemTitle,     SUM(b.qty) AS SoldQty,     SUM(c.qty) AS PurQty,     SUM(d.qty) AS RetQty from items a  left join sales b on a.ItemID = b.items_ItemID left join purchases c on a.ItemID = c.items_itemID left join returned d on a.ItemID = d.items_ItemID group by a.ItemID  </code></pre>  <p>That query was one of the many tries that i've tried :D the result i get is always unique for sales but duplicates for other tables ..</p>  <p>Thanks for the answer. </p>
