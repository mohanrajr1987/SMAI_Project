<p>I have the repeated data. There are two waves. I want to select the people who did a test twice, so their ID are repeated twice. Some people only did once, and I want to exclude them. My data are a long structure format.In the data structure, there is a variable called" wave", which is either labeled "1" or"2". So, my problem is I want to take a ID with wave 1 and wave 2. Here is my data :</p>  <p><code>id&lt;-c(1, 2, 3,4,5,6,1,2,4) wave&lt;-c(1,1,2,1,2,2,2,2,2) df&lt;-cbind(id,wave)</code> </p>  <p>so ID with 1,2,4 have two waves and I want to take them out.</p>
