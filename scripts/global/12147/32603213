<p>this seems like a very easy question and in fact I know how to help myself but I hope to find a quicker approach to this problem.</p>  <p>I have two tables with the same structure in an sql-dbms, whereas some lines of data occur in both tables. My way of finding these duplicates is making an inner-join with all columns in the "on-statement", like:</p>  <pre><code>create table target as   select     a.column_1    a.column_2    a.column_3    ...    a.column_20 from table source_1 as a inner join source_2 as b  on a.column_1 = b.column_1 and      a.column_2 = b.column_2 and     ...     a.column_20 = b.column_20 ; </code></pre>  <p>With a large amount of columns in the tables, this produces a long piece of code. Is there some kind of syntax or method to make this shorter? Thanks for your help, kind regards.</p>
