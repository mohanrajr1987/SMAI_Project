<p>I am developing an application using Phonon to display video. I used MediaObject and VideoWidget to read file and display video. My problem is how could I display two video of that file simultaneously.</p>  <p>I had an idea that I still used MediaObject to read video file and connect it to VideoWidget. Everytime VideoWIdget receive new frame, it forwards to other QWidget to display 2nd video. But I can not figure out how to do it</p>  <p>Any help would be appreciated!</p>
