<p>For example, i have following table</p>  <pre><code>Mobile number  Timestamp   123456         17-09-2015 11:30  455677         17-09-2015 12:15 123456         17-09-2015 12:25   453377         17-09-2015 13:15 </code></pre>  <p>If now is 11:30, I want to scan my table and find rows with the same numbers within the past 1 hour.</p>  <p>That's my SQL statement:</p>  <pre><code>select a.number, a.time from mytable a inner join      (select number, time       from mytable b       where time&gt;=now()-Interval 1 hour and time&lt;=now ()       group by number       Having count(*) &gt; 1      ) b      on a.number = b.number and a.time = b.time  </code></pre>  <p>I want to find duplicate rown with the same numbers happening within 1 hour.
