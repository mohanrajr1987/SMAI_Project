<p>I am trying to search for duplicates in columns and rows and black out those duplicates with "x".</p>  <p>Rules: 1.No row or column can have a duplicate number. Blacking out a square erases the number in that square.<br> 2. Blacked out squares cannot share an adjacent edge horizontally or vertically. Blacked out squares can share a corner.<br> 3. White squares (which are not blacked out), must all each share at least one adjacent edge horizontally or vertically with another white square  </p>  <p>python code:</p>  <pre><code>puzzle2 = [(2,1,2,3),(2,4,3,4),(2,2,2,1),(4,3,1,2)]  #Transpose list - 4x4 puzzle result = [[puzzle2[j][i] for j in range(len(puzzle2))]           for i in range(len(puzzle2[0]))]  for r in result:     print(r)  Output  [2, 2, 2, 4] [1, 4, 2, 3] [2, 3, 2, 1] [3, 4, 1, 2]   Final output should be [x, 2, x, 4] [1, 4, 2, 3] [2, 3, x, 1] [3, x, 1, 2] </code></pre>
