<p>First time poster and enthusiastic Access newbie.</p>  <p>I've got a search screen based on Allen Browne's wonderful search in vba (<a href="http://allenbrowne.com/ser-62.html" rel="nofollow">http://allenbrowne.com/ser-62.html</a>).  This has worked great for most of my purposes, but now a child table is duplicating records.</p>  <p>Our clients(providers), can be enrolled in multiple programs.  we've got four.  I want a search that let's me filter by provider type, but not create duplicate records when a provider is enrolled in more than one provider type.  In the example image, carmen titus is in the LEHRC and fccn programs, and therefore shows up twice.  Tried to post pic but no dice.</p>  <p>Please help!  I searched diligently and could not find a solution.  I'd appreciate the support or to be pointed to a related post.  I hope this makes sense.  I think half my battle as a self-trained newbie is not knowing the terminology.</p>
