<p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Q1pkZ.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Q1pkZ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I have an excel file which gets updated on a daily basis i.e the data is always different every time.</p>  <p>I am pulling the data from the Excel sheet into the table using <strong>Talend</strong>. I have a primary key <code>Company_ID</code> defined in the table.</p>  <p>The error I am facing is that the Excel sheet has few duplicate <code>Company_ID</code> values. It will also pick up more duplicate values in the future as the Excel file will be updated daily.</p>  <p>I want to choose the first record where the <code>Company ID</code> field is <code>1</code> and the record doesn't have null in the rest of the columns. Also, for a <code>Company_ID</code> of <code>3</code> there is a null value for one column which is ok since it is a unique record for that <code>company_id</code>.</p>  <p>How do I choose a unique row which has maximum no. of column values present ie for eg in the case of <code>Company ID</code> of <code>1</code> in Talend ? </p>
