<p>I am quite new to VBA and wanted to see if i was going about my task the long way.</p>  <p>I need to ask users questions and am using a VBA form to do so, once they input there answers this will then save to the workbook in the specified cells.</p>  <p>However they will need to answer the same questions for each country, the questions will stay the same, but values, and cell locations differ. Is there a way to do this without creating 50 identical forms?</p>  <p>I should also mention that data will be prefilled from when they answered the questions previously which eliminates the ability of adding to the next blank row.</p>
