<p>How can I remove duplicate items from a list if all I know is that the list elements can be ordered?  (I also don't care about the order of items in the list.)</p>  <p>Answered questions like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/479897/how-do-you-remove-duplicates-from-a-list-in-python-if-the-item-order-is-not-impo">this one</a> or <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7961363/python-removing-duplicates-in-lists">this one</a> require the use of a set. In summary, all of the answers I found for this <strong>required the items in the list to be hashable</strong>, which is an absurd requirement.</p>  <p>Assuming the list can be sorted, this is relatively easy to solve.</p>
