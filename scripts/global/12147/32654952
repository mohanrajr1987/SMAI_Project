<p>I need help in summarizing by counting the instances of users that have records within 7 days. The occurrence needs not to be the first occurrence only but any instance that occurred within 7 days. </p>  <pre><code>User     Datetime User1    3/4/2015 12:14 User1    3/24/2015 15:25 User2    4/15/2015 11:08 User2    4/17/2015 5:06 User2    4/20/2015 6:17 User2    4/28/2015 12:15 User3    5/12/2015 9:48 User3    5/18/2015 11:54 User3    5/18/2015 11:59 </code></pre>  <p>I tried using <code>aggregate</code> or <code>melt</code> but that only gives me the count if I treat datetime as factors by date only.</p>  <p>So, in the sample data above, User2 has a count of 2 and User3 has a count of 2.</p>
