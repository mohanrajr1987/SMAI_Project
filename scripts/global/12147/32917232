<p>I have an Excel (2010) data file with over 200 variables (columns), and over 1,000 records (rows), each identified with a unique id number.  However, I'm suspicious that some of these records are fabricated, i.e., someone took an existing record, replicated it, and changed only a few numbers to make it a little different.  Therefore, I need to produce a matrix that will show me the number/percent of "same values" between each record and all other records (e.g., record 1 and record 2 share 75 equal values, record 1 and record 3 share 57 equal values, record 2 and record 3 share 45 equal values, etc.).  I have a few workarounds, but they take hours and don't produce a simple matrix.  I don't care about the difference between the values - just whether they are equal or not.  Any ideas will be greatly appreciated!</p>
