<p>I am working on a small expense tracking program. The idea is to have a list that holds Expense objects that can be manipulated and used to perform calculations. </p>  <p>I was able to create the List without issue and populate it with several dummy expenses. My expenses are grouped by category, Expense.expenseType, to allow me to do calculations for analysis so I am trying to make another List that will store category names and relevant calculations values. The list of category names is meant to remove duplicates but so far I've been unsuccessful at populating it. </p>  <p>My approach for creating the List has been to define a Category class that holds only a string parameter for categoryName and a float for categoryTotal although the latter is initialized to 0.00. I then have a For loop that copies the names into the List and a second For loop that removes indexes based on the name once they've been alphabetized. I've tried different variations of this but ultimately I get either an index that is out of bounds or a reduced but still duplicates list of categoryName. </p>  <p>Really hoping to get some advice so I could move forward with the code. I didn't add the actual code since I'm new to C#/VS and figure I may be approaching the problem all wrong. </p>
