<p>I am using a fairly unknown js date pick library. But I get an undefined index error for the date field when trying to submit the form. I have noticed in the HTML in google chrome, there is a added "globalnumber=" field and I have not been able to figure out what this is about. Is it possible that this is the reason the form is not submitting.</p>  <p>HTML Input Field From Google Chrome:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;input type="text" id="date" name="date" required globalnumber="673"&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Error:</p>  <pre><code>Notice: Undefined index: date in /home/stretch045/public_html/application/controller/events.php on line 47 </code></pre>  <p>print_r($_POST);</p>  <pre><code>Array ( [name] =&gt; test [startTime] =&gt; 1234 [endTime] =&gt; 1235 [description] =&gt; test  ) </code></pre>  <p>jsDatePick Library: <a href="http://javascriptcalendar.org/javascript-date-picker.php" rel="nofollow">http://javascriptcalendar.org/javascript-date-picker.php</a></p>  <p>Live Demo: <a href="http://www.aaron-schpitzer.ca/en/events/add" rel="nofollow">http://www.aaron-schpitzer.ca/en/events/add</a></p>  <p>I have been unable to find anything anywhere about a globalnumber. Please help</p>
