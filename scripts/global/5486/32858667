<p>I am trying to learn php and I have seen some videos and tutorials, when creating session variables which values are going to be pulled out from values entered in input elements, the "id" of the input element is the one that matters while when checking if a submit button was clicked is the "name" of the input element what matters?</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php  if (isset($_POST['Register'])) {  //Register is the "name"     session_start();    $Fname = $_POST['first_name'];  //first_name is the "id"     ... } ?&gt; &lt;!doctype html&gt; ... &lt;form action="" method="post" name="registerform" id="registerform"&gt; &lt;input name="firstname" type="text" id="first_name"&gt;  ... &lt;input name="Register" type="submit" id="register" value="submit"&gt; </code></pre>
