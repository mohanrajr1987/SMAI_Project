<p>I have been trying to get this program to work which is supposed to continue to take input from a user until -1 is entered and compute the sum. The problem is as follows:  Design and implement a Java program (name it  InputSum ) that prompts the user to  enter a positive integer number. The program should ac cept integers until the user enters the value -1  (negative one). After the user enters -1, the program s hould display the entered numbers followed by their sum  as shown below. Notice that -1 is not part of the output.  Make sure the program  validates each entered number before proc essing it as the user may enter negative  numbers other than the sentential value -1 .<br> Design your program such that it  allows the user to re-run the  program with a different set of inputs in the same run as shown above.  Document your code, and organize and  space out your outputs as shown above. </p>  <p>Here is my code:</p>  <pre><code>/* Class:        CS1301 * Section:       9:30 * Term:          Fall 2015 * Name:          Matthew Woolridge * Instructor:    Mr. Robert Thorsen * Assignment:    Assignment 6 * Program:       1 * ProgramName:   InputSum * Purpose:       The program prompts the user to input numbers until -1 is entered and calculates the sum * Operation:     The information is statically instantiated in the code and *                the data is output to the screen. * Input(s):      The input is the numbers * Output(s):     The output will be the sum of the numbers * Methodology:   The program will use loops to determine if numbers or still to be entered or if -1 was entered * */  import java.util.*; import java.io.*; public class InputSum {     public static void main (String[] args)    {        /******************************************************************************       *                          Declarations Section                               *       ******************************************************************************/       /****************************CONSTANTS********************************/       Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in); //Initializes scanner        int n = 1;       int [] num = new int[n]; //Creates array for input numbers       int i;       int sum=0;        /******************************************************************************       *                             Inputs Section                                  *       ******************************************************************************/        System.out.print("Please input integers, note that -1 ends the submissions: "); //Prompts the user for input       /****************************variables********************************/      //***************************Calculations in processing************************//      /******************************************************************************       *                             Processing Section                            *       ******************************************************************************/       for(i=0; i&lt;num.length; i++)       {          num[i] = scan.nextInt(); //Continues to read numbers and add them to the sum          n = n + 1; //Adds to the array maximum          sum = sum + num[i]; //Calculates the sum          if (num[i] == -1){             break;          }       }       System.out.print("The numbers entered are: " + num[i]);       System.out.print("\nThe sum of the numbers is: " + sum);        /******************************************************************************        *                              Outputs Section                                *        ******************************************************************************/        //***************Output is in the processing**************************//    } } </code></pre>  <p>The problem is, the program keeps getting hung up on the line where it is supposed to print the sum. Any and all help is appreciated!</p>
