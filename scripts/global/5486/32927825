<p>Haven't got a whole lot of experience in making android apps. Is it possible to add/remove user input widgets and actions to an android in the field without having to recompile and reinstall?</p>  <p>I am thinking the user should be able to use a service that constructs a simple interface inside the app they have installed beforehand.</p>  <p>So like creating a building a htmlform from a json object. A series of widgets and validation rules, which is known individually beforehand, but strung together in a dynamically defined series.</p>  <p>Does that make sense? I am sorry, it's a little hard to explain and I am not a native english speaker.</p>  <p>I could of course a web-view or just make it a webapp and use the browser or maybe phone-gap or something like it will have the tools for doing this, but I just really wanted to use a native app for it, if possible.</p>  <p>I have tried googling, but with no luck.</p>  <p>Is this possible to do? If so how?</p>
