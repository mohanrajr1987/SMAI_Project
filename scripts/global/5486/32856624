<p>Today I faced a situation with angularJS.</p>  <p>Hi have a recipe website, and to list the ingredients and theyr respective dosage I'm using angular's ng-repeat (here goes the snippet).</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div ng-repeat="food in foodList | filter:query"&gt;     &lt;label&gt;         {{food.name}}     &lt;/label&gt;     &lt;input type="text" class="form-control food-list-input" data-id="{{food.ingredientId}}" placeholder="Weight in grams."&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>The thing is that when I apply the filter, all inputs I previously inserted some value, if they are hidden because of the filter, they return to empty. </p>  <p>Is there anyway around this? </p>
