<p>I have a problem that I cant solve which should be rather simple but just doenst work. I have a button, which onclick should give an other input the attribute :checked.</p>  <p>My code and approach to this is:</p>  <p>The button:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;img src="../images/eye.svg" alt="eye"&gt;&lt;a onclick="$('#active-button6').prop('checked', true);" href="#product__details"&gt;Bildgalerie&lt;/a&gt; </code></pre>  <p>So onclick it should select the input with the id #active-button6 and then set the prop checked to true. The href is just so it jumps to that area on the page.</p>  <p>The input just looks like a normal radio input:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;input class="acc-check" type="radio" name="accordion-1" id="acc-content-6"/&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Whats wrong with my approach? jQuery is linked in the head, so I didnt forget that.</p>  <p>Thanks alot in advance, cheers</p>
