<p>What I am trying to achieve is a simple input tag with an specific value. <br> To give a clear example I'll try to explain the exact situation.</p>  <p><strong>Example of the idea</strong></p>  <p>Imagine you are currently on the following location: <a href="https://www.domain.com/files/application.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.domain.com/files/application.html</a></p>  <p>Now what I want was an input to directly link me to the file location.</p>  <p>(for example: <a href="https://www.domain.com/files/images/cats/snowball.jpg" rel="nofollow">https://www.domain.com/files/images/cats/snowball.jpg</a>)</p>  <p><strong>Work so far</strong></p>  <p>So I started by building the basics: <br></p>  <p><em>Open file:</em> <strong><em>[ Input ] [ Option ] [ Button ]</em></strong></p>  <p><strong><em>Input:</em></strong> Will be the location to fill in any cat name (snowball). <br> <strong><em>Option:</em></strong> Will give the options .jpg .jpeg .png .more (.jpg selected). <br> <strong><em>Button:</em></strong> Will take you to your location (images/cats/snowball.jpg). <br></p>  <p><strong>Problem</strong></p>  <p>But after setting all this up I realized I had no idea how to make those tags communicate with each other and since it's quite a specific question I had no clue what to search for. I could not thing of any possible way for the input to (invisibly) add "images/cats/" by default, add the user input (Snowball) plus the option tag value (.jpg) and also interact with the button tag. <br> But of course there are no limits nowadays. <br></p>  <p>Any solution, link or advice would be great. <br></p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
