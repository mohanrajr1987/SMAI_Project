<p>so I have a problem that asks me for two primary colors and tells me the color they create, however when I enter the two primary colors I keep getting the error message that I put in if they don't enter two primary colors. Here is what I have.</p>  <pre><code>red = '1' blue = '2' yellow = '3'  p1 = (input('Enter primary color: ')) p2 = (input('Enter primary color: '))  if p1 == '1' and p2 == '2':     print('When you mix red and blue, you get purple') elif p1 == '3' and p2 == '1':     print('When you mix yellow and red, you get orange') elif p1 == '2' and p2 == '3':     print('When you mix blue and yellow, you get green') else:     print('You didnt input two primary colors.') </code></pre>
