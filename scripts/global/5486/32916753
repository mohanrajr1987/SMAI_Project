<p>I'm setting up a typical profile picture upload and crop feature for a site. I'm looking at how others have set it up and I see that many are managing to have one input type="file" and it not only allows for selecting a file but also calls the PHP or JS to display the image. </p>  <p>I'm completely stuck on how to make it do something after the image has been chosen. </p>  <p>Does any one have a link or suggestion on how to perform this?</p>
