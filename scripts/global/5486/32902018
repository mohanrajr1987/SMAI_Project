<p>I am looking to recode a php script I'm using to hide email form input on a script. </p>  <p>Like many php scripts, it asks for an email address to proceed however I'm trying to make it simple and remove it â€“ I set a default password and hid it or put the password on <code>opacity: 0</code> - thus the person enters username and presses submit.</p>  <p>Could I get some help on how to do this or perhaps always have a random email generated in form? I'm not sure how to go about this. </p>  <pre><code>'email' =&gt; array(     'label' =&gt; qa_lang_html('users/email_label'),     'tags' =&gt; 'name="email" id="email"',     'value' =&gt; qa_html('email@gmail.com'),     'note' =&gt; qa_opt('email_privacy'),     'error' =&gt; qa_html(@$errors['email']), ), </code></pre>
