<p>I'm currently trying to figure out how to read in a file that looks like this:</p>  <p>0002139821,0</p>  <p>9331500022,1</p>  <p>2349031913,0</p>  <p>etc...</p>  <p>into a single 2D array, but what I need to do is read each individual number from each row into each subscript of the array (so array[row][col]). The last digit after the comma would go into a separate int array. Any help would be appreciated, thank you.</p>
