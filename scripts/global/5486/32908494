<p>I have to take input from user in one line,and there is one condition</p>  <p>3 2 1 3</p>  <p>2 1 4</p>  <p>1 5 2</p>  <p>condition is:-</p>  <p>if first number is 3 then i have to take 3 more input.</p>  <p>if first number is 1 or 2 i have to take 2 more input</p>  <p>i tried <code>a,b,c,d=map(int,input.split())</code></p>  <p>but this didn't work because in case of 2 or 1 I want just 2 more inputs so d is extraneous and input throws an error.</p>  <p>Code in C:-</p>  <pre><code>scanf("%d",&amp;a); if(a==3) scanf("%d%d%d",&amp;b,&amp;c,&amp;d); else scanf("%d%d",&amp;b,&amp;c); </code></pre>
