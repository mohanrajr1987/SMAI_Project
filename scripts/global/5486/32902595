<p>I've been going through Bjarne Stroustrup's Programming: Principles and Practices Using C++ for my own benefit. This is not homework and this is not for school.</p>  <p>I'm at my wit's end with this drill from Chapter 4. I'm supposed to take in a number and a unit from input, store the number as a double and the unit as a string in a while loop, and keep track of the largest and smallest numbers seen so far. It works perfectly for units that are one character like "m" or "g", but when I enter a two-character unit such as "cm" or "ft" the loop ends and the program terminates. Below is my code:</p>  <pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;  using namespace std;  int main() {     double temp = 0;     string unit = " ";     double largest = 0;     double smallest = 0;      while (cin &gt;&gt; temp &gt;&gt; unit)     {         if (largest == 0 &amp;&amp; smallest == 0)         {             largest = temp;             smallest = temp;             cout &lt;&lt; "That's the largest number seen so far.\n";             cout &lt;&lt; "That's the smallest number seen so far.\n";         }         else if (temp &gt;= largest)         {             largest = temp;             cout &lt;&lt; "That's the largest number seen so far.\n";         }         else if (temp &lt;= smallest)         {             smallest = temp;             cout &lt;&lt; "That's the smallest number seen so far.\n";         }         else         {             cout &lt;&lt; temp &lt;&lt; '\n';         }      }     return 0; } </code></pre>  <p>I really appreciate any help in solving this problem. It's driving me insane.</p>
