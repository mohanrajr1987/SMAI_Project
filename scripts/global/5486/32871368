<p>First off, why does the decimal point appear on a numeric keypad - only on the S5? I don't want it to appear. Second, and most importantly, I can't even disable the decimal entry by observing the keypress event, because "." does not seem to fire one on S5 with 4.4.2</p>  <pre><code>&lt;input type="number" placeholder="YYYY" name="year" class="char-4" inputmode="numeric" pattern="[0-9]*" data-numeric-input="" maxlength="4" max="9999"&gt; </code></pre>  <p><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/fv3dfeu3/2/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/fv3dfeu3/2/</a></p>  <p>Any ideas?</p>
