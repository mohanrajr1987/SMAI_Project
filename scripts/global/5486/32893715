<p>I want to create an application where i can play a .wav file after the input matches a certain number. Now I've only come up across threads on how to check if the input is only numbers etc. but i couldn't find any solution yet for my problem.</p>  <p>Here's some code I'm currently using:</p>  <pre><code>if(fortwenty_Tb.Text.Equals("420")) {     player.Play(); } </code></pre>  <p>The application works, but the sound isn't playing. I've already checked if the <code>.wav</code> file was faulty, but it isn't since it does work after i tried playing it with a button controller.</p>
