<p>So I'm trying to split an arbitrarily long user input integer into a list where each entry is 2 digits, and if the number has an odd amount of integers put the only single digit as the first digit. (Where I will then proceed to put a zero in front of it)</p>  <p>I know that putting user integer input into a list looks like:</p>  <pre><code>userintegerlist = [int(i) for i in str(user_input)] print userintegerlist </code></pre>  <p>And my input (say it's <code>45346</code>) will look like <code>[4,5,3,4,6]</code>.  But I want it to look like: <code>[4,53,46]</code>. Or if input is <code>68482238</code>, it will be: <code>[68,48,22,38]</code>.</p>  <p>Is this possible? All the code is in Python by the way.</p>
