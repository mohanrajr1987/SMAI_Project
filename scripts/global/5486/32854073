<p>Disclaimer: I'm massively new to programming, about all I've done is very basic, specific stuff in fortran and batch scripting.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/RJj3Lhi.png" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is the end product of what I'm trying to make.  Essentially, it is an input file for a program called MODTRAN (written in fortran) which models radiative transfer through a specified atmospheric profile.  Writing these inputs is a pain and is extremely finicky - which might just be a product of fortran itself as I've read.  Each one of the values has to be separated by a specific number of spaces and it's not particularly obvious what each variable is.</p>  <p>What I want to make is a GUI with a series of text boxes that I can fill in for each variable that will then write them to a text file - with the correct spacing in between variables - that I can run MODTRAN with.  </p>  <p>I'm currently just playing around in <a href="http://i.imgur.com/LdzDVxD.png" rel="nofollow">Matlab</a> trying to get a handle on the "guide" interface, but I'm not sure if I should stay with this platform or just build something that stands alone.  </p>  <p>Thanks guys!</p>  <p>Edit:  I forgot to add that it would be extremely helpful if the text boxes had a default value.  i.e. if they aren't explicitly filled in, they default to 0.</p>
