<p>I've downloaded Xcode 5.1.1, and when I tried to install iOS 6.0 Simulator, I get an error: "Could not download and install iOS 6.0 Simulator. The package “iPhoneSimulatorSDK6_0.pkg” is untrusted."</p>  <p>iOS 6.1 Simulator downloaded and installed successfully but when I run I get an error: "iOS Simulator failed to install the application." Hitting "Reset Content and Settings" in the Simulator doesn't help.</p>  <p>I also have installed latest Xcode 6.3.1. How can I test my applications on iOS 6.0 or 6.1?</p>
