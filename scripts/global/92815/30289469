<p>Hope all of you'll be fine. <br /> I am doing a project in which i need to add core-data functionality. I am working on xcode-5. I need to add pch file in xcode-5 existing project as it was missing in the project. I have searched a lot on net to add pch file in xcode-5 but only found procedures to add pch file in xcode-6. which is totally different with xocde-5. Please provide step by step help to add pch file in xcode 5 (as I am new to ios). Many thanks in advance.</p>
