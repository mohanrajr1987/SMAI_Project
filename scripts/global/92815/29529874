<p>[EDIT] Possible fix: my ipa was unsigned, I bought a Developer's account and will test tomorrow with a signed .ipa. [/EDIT] This is my second app. It's very simple, all it does is send a post request to my server, and display a response. It works perfectly on the iOS simulator on Xcode, but when I push the ipa to my phone, it just crashes. A friend of mine also tested it, and the same happened. Can you please take a look at the code?  It's not that long: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByoF_XNJWlVyeHJHdHp3LVdTS3c/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByoF_XNJWlVyeHJHdHp3LVdTS3c/view?usp=sharing</a> Here's the ipa: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByoF_XNJWlVyeGJrNldMb1BPMVE/view" rel="nofollow">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByoF_XNJWlVyeGJrNldMb1BPMVE/view</a> </p>  <p>I also can't/don't know how to get a crash report for the app on my phone, so if you need that I'd need help on how to get it too.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
