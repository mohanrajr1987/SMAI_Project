<p>I have a tab bar controller with some customized icons but I want the standard Settings icon in Xcode.  It looks like it is in a folder called Supporting Files that gets created with a new project in Xcode 5.  However, I started this project on the prior version of Xcode.</p>  <p>Can someone tell me how I can either get the Supporting Files folder into my project or at least get the standard Settings icon png?  Thanks.</p>
