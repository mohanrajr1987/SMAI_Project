<p>I recently updated my development environment from XCode v5.1 to XCode v6.1 and found a lot of elements in the new storyboard in individual "screens" as out of place. I have added two screenshots of the storyboard for the comparison</p>  <p>XCode 5</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/TeAfI.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>XCode 6</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/sQD5t.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>My question would be, what is the easiest way I can ensure that the elements are ordered correctly? </p>  <p>I did look into adaptive layouts, but using size classes only complicated things. Additionaly, the intended support is only for iPhones in a specific orientation, so don't feel the effort is necessary.</p>  <p>Any Ideas?</p>
