<p>I got an errors like this: <code>malloc: *** error for object 0x10ec5750: pointer being freed was not allocated *** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug Project(4017,0xb0115000) malloc: *** error for object 0x1179fe90: pointer being freed was not allocated *** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug</code>. I read that i should to use malloc_error_break. I follow to Breakpoint Navigator -> (plus in bottom) add a new breakpoint-> add Symbolic Breakpoint. Then i fill in the form.<code>Symbol: malloc_error_break  Module: libSystem.B.dylib</code> Run project and i get the same error. Maybe i set <code>malloc_error_break</code> incorrect? And how it should be looks like correct? How it works? Thanks.</p>
