<p>I am trying to download Xcode on my MacBook but once it is downloaded I receive the message " you can't open the application "Xcode " because it is not supported on this architecture. My MacBook is OS X version 10.5.8 and I have tried many Xcode from the latest to Xcode 5.1.1 with no result. </p>
