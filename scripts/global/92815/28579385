<p>Although Its not a technical question but because I am new to XCode(5.1) so I am asking it. Everytime I click on build option from menu in xcode then xcode hangs for around 30 seconds, loading icon appears though and after around 30 seconds the build starts. So it is irritating that everytime I have to wait for this amount of time. Does anybody know how to resolve this problem?</p>
