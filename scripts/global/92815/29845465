<p>I have an Xcode5 project that builds a static library as its product. While building this library i had turned on the Code coverage settings i.e. "<strong>Generate Test Coverage files" and " Instrument Program Flow"</strong>.  As a result, when library was built, gcno files were created for all the files correspondingly in the same directory.</p>  <p>And in order to calculate its code coverage i have another project which links to this library and creates an executable. This project was also built with "<strong>Generate Test Coverage files" and " Instrument Program Flow"</strong> as YES.</p>  <p>Now, upon executing this product, only the gcda files for the files in the project of my test executable are generated.</p>  <p>How can i generate the gcda files for the static library that was linked into my project while building it. </p>
