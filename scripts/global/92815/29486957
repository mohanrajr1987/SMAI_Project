<p>I have created a new pre-release version in iTunes connect for one of my app which is already there in app-store. </p>  <p>So the Live version is 2.1 and I have created a new version 2.2 in iTunes and it is showing as <code>2.2 Prepare for Submission</code></p>  <p>with yellow icon besides it. Also I have changed my xcode 5.1.1  <code>version</code> and <code>code</code> strings to <code>2.2</code></p>  <p>But when I archive my build and select submit to appstore via xcode 5.1.1 it is not giving me the option to select the new build version 2.2. It is showing the current app version <code>2.1</code> in <code>choose profile to sign with</code> screen.</p>  <p>Please let me know what I am doing wrong this time because earlier as soon as I created a new version it was visible in xcode.</p>  <p>Thanks   </p>
