<p>I'm very frusturated with this program. I have given methods and asked to write them out. The methods are:</p>  <p>Methods:</p>  <p>6 methods (which should be public)</p>  <p>·         A method called getAge().  It will receive nothing and return the age.</p>  <p>·<br> ·         A method called setGPA.  It will receive a new GPA (as a double) and set the “real” GPA to whatever is received.  It returns nothing.</p>  <p>·<br> ·         A method called setOnScholarship.  It will receive a boolean value and will set the “real” onScholarship data field to whatever is passed in.  It returns nothing.</p>  <p>·<br> ·         A method called toString.   This method will receive no arguments and return a String with all of the information for whatever Student instance is told to return its toString.<br> The String it should return should be made up of:</p>  <pre><code>     &lt;its name&gt;&lt;tab&gt;&lt;its age&gt;&lt;tab&gt;&lt;its gender&gt;&lt;tab&gt;&lt;its gpa&gt;&lt;tab&gt;&lt;onScholarship&gt; </code></pre>  <p>·         A method called onProbation.   This method will receive no arguments and return a boolean.  It will return true if the Student’s onScholarship field is true and the Student’s gpa is &lt; 2.0.  Otherwise, it returns false.</p>  <p>·<br> ·         A method called complain.  This method will receive no arguments and return a String.  The String will be any complaint that you want your Student instance to “say” about anything.</p>  <p>and this is what i wrote so far...:</p>  <p>package writingclasses;</p>  <p>public class Student {     //data      String name;    //" "      int age;        //0      char gender;    //'\0'      double gpa;     //0.0      boolean onsholarship;</p>  <pre><code>//constructors    public Student() {      String name;    //" "     int age;        //0     char gender;    //'\0'     double gpa;     //0.0     boolean onsholarship;   }  public Student(String newName, int age, char gender, double gpa, boolean onScholarship) {         this.name = name;     }  //methods public int getAge() { //example student stud1 mean object = new student();     // stud1.getAge();         return this.age; }  public static void setGPA(double gpa) {   System.out.println();  }   public static void setOnScholarship(boolean onScholarship) {   System.out.println(); }   public boolean onProbation() {         if (onScholarship true)          if(gpa &lt; 2.0)              return true;          else     return false; }  public String toString() {                     return name + age + gender + gpa + onsholarship; }  public String complain() {     return name; } </code></pre>  <p>}</p>  <p>I would like someone to review my work and give me some feedback.  I would really appreciate it.  Thank you </p>
