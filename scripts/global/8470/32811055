<p>Recently I have lesson about the concept of basic operation of sets. The basic operation of sets actually based on membership between elements and sets. But I feel confused why it is true that basic operations, such as union, intersection, complement and difference, of sets can be implemented in a constant time?</p>  <p>Could anyone explain it with some simple examples. I really appreciate for it.</p>
