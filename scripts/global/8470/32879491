<p>Is</p>  <pre><code>list(set(some_list)) </code></pre>  <p>a good way to remove duplicates from a list?   (Python 3.3 if that matters)</p>  <p>(Edited to address some of the comments... it was perhaps too terse before).</p>  <p>Specifically,</p>  <ul> <li>is it at least comparable, in terms of efficiency (mainly speed but also memory), if not better than writing ones own algorithm; it's clearly the most concise code</li> <li>is it reliable?  any situations where it breaks?  (one has been mentioned already ... list items need to be hashable)</li> <li>is there a more Pythonesque way of doing it?  </li> </ul>
