<p>I've seen a lot of people asking questions about searching through folders and creating a list of files, but I haven't found anything that has helped me do the opposite.</p>  <p>I have a csv file with a list of files and their extensions (xxx0.laz, xxx1.laz, xxx2.laz, etc). I need to read through this list and then search through a folder for those files. Then I need to move those files to another folder.</p>  <p>So far, I've taken the csv and created a list. At first I was having trouble with the list. Each line had a "\n" at the end, so I removed those. From the only other example I've found...

So I created a set from the list. However, I'm not really sure why or if I need it. </p>  <p>So here's what I have:</p>  <pre><code>id = open('file.csv','r') list = list(id) list_final = ''.join([item.rstrip('\n') for item in list]) unique_identifiers = set(list_final)  os.chdir(r'working_dir') # I set this as the folder to look through destination_folder = 'folder_loc' # Folder to move files to for identifier in unique_identifiers:     for filename in glob.glob('%s_*' % identifier)"         shutil.move(filename, destination_folder) </code></pre>  <p>I've been wondering about this ('%s_*' % identifier) with the glob function. I haven't found any examples with this, perhaps that needs to be changed?</p>  <p>When I do all that, I don't get anything. No errors and no actual files moved... </p>  <p>Perhaps I'm going about this the wrong way, but that is the only thing I've found so far anywhere.</p>
