<p>I'm trying to change the values of a group of selected cells when I release the ctrl key.</p>  <pre><code>        private void dataGridView1_KeyUp(object sender, KeyEventArgs e)     {         if (e.KeyCode == Keys.ControlKey)         {             foreach (DataGridViewCell c in dataGridView1.SelectedCells)             {                 c.ReadOnly = false;                 c.Style.BackColor = colorDialog1.Color;                 c.ValueType = currentSymbol.GetType();                 c.Value = currentSymbol;                  dataGridView1.BeginEdit(true);                 dataGridView1.EndEdit();             }         }     } </code></pre>  <p>For some reason, the line "c.Value = currentSymbol;" does nothing.</p>  <p>c.Value remains null for no apparent reason.</p>  <p>I've tried everything I can think of, and the Value member just remains as null.</p>  <p>I'm starting to remember why I stopped using the default dataGridView, they're a frustrating nightmare to work with and never behave according to the documentation. Unfortunately I have to use one for this project.</p>  <p>What am I missing here? I've never seen a set command simply disobey before without throwing any kind of error. </p>
