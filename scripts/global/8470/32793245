<p>I have to implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_algorithm" rel="nofollow">Kruskal's Algorithm</a> in Java.</p>  <p>I have the part that I get the edges ordered by weight, but I am a little lost when I have to think the structure to save the sets of each tree.</p>  <p>I thought in having a vector of sets, where each sets represents a tree. But I don't know what to do if I have to union two trees. Delete both elements from the vector and add a new combined one?</p>  <p>Is there an structure that would make it easier?</p>  <p>What I need is:</p>  <ul> <li>Iterate over all sets from a major set</li> <li>Add an element to one of the sets, or</li> <li>Create a new set and add it to the major set</li> <li>Union two of those sets (of course, deleting their singular versions)</li> </ul>
