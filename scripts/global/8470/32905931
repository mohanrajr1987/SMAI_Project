<p>I have a  list of numbers eg.</p>  <ul> <li>120</li> <li>233</li> <li>197</li> <li>400</li> <li>276</li> <li>356</li> <li>121</li> </ul>  <p>For the purpose of my program these numbers have to be arranged in two sets. Based on what numbers are in the set the program calculates the efficiency of each set. It then combines the efficiency quotients for the combination of the two sets. The two sets and its efficiency quotient then gets saved in an array.</p>  <p>The goal is to find the combination of sets where both the sets have the highest efficiency.</p>  <p>My problem: At the moment, i can't seem to wrap my head around the algorithm needed to check every possible set combination. As far as i can get it seems to need a form of recursion.</p>  <p>If you need more information let me know! Thanks in advance!</p>
