<p>I have a set, which I would like to divide into smaller sets of size x. Guava has something similar for lists - <a href="http://docs.guava-libraries.googlecode.com/git-history/v12.0/javadoc/com/google/common/collect/Lists.html#partition%28java.util.List,%20int%29" rel="nofollow">Lists.partition</a>. But I couldn't find anything related to Sets. Are there any libraries which can help me in doing this? If not, what's the best way to break a set into smaller sets?</p>  <p>Edit: Currently, I'm doing it as follows:</p>  <pre><code>int x = 10; Set&lt;String&gt; stringSet = createHashSet(); for (List&lt;String&gt; partition : Iterables.partition(stringSet, x) {     doSomething(new HashSet&lt;&gt;(partition)); } </code></pre>  <p>I'm using this <a href="https://google-collections.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javadoc/com/google/common/collect/Iterables.html" rel="nofollow">Iterables.partition</a>. There should be better ways to do it, which doesn't involve converting set to a list, and then back to a set.</p>
