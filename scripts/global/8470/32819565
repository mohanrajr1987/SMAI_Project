<p>I am having a hot discussion with a colleague because he doesn't want to admit that it is better to use existing classes from the Java package than writing your own.</p>  <p>We want to access a set in a threadsafe way so that Iterators also work.</p>  <p>I found the class <code>ConcurrentSkipListSet</code> but it needs me to implement the <code>Comparable</code> interface, which we dont need. He argues that this is worse than writing the whole synchronized stuff. I say no.</p>  <p>Is there a better Java class than ConcurrentSkipListSet that doesn't make me implement <code>Comparable</code>?</p>
