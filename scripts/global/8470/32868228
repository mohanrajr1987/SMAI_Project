<p>I use a hashset for a dictionary. Now I would like to filter out words that do not start with my substring. So it should be something like this: </p>  <pre><code>String word = 'ab'; List&lt;String&gt; list = Arrays.asList(word); boolean result = lexiconSet.retainAll(list); </code></pre>  <p>And instead of this resulting in the lexicon only containing the word 'ab', I would like to keep all words beginning with 'ab'. How can I do this?</p>  <p>I know I can convert the set to a string arraylist, and loop over all elements to see if the strings starts with 'ab', but since I think this can be time consuming and not efficient, I would like to hear better solutions. Thank you in advance!</p>
