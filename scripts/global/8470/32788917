<p>I have a simple piece of code with an error. I've boiled it down to being the piece of code below. The error given is "AttributeError: 'set' object has no attribute 'append'". </p>  <p>1, What is a 'set' object? and  2, Does anyone have any idea how to resolve this issue? </p>  <p>Thank you for any help</p>  <p>Edit: The entire code is now included and the error code refers to the line "solution_list.append(solution)".</p>  <pre><code>while True:     print("I will find all cube sum solutions to any number you type, give me one!")     number = int(input("Which number do you want me to check for? "))      solution_list = []     solution = []      for a in range(0, int(number**(1/3)+1)):         b = (number - a**3)**(1/3)          if b%1==0:             b = int(b)             solution = [a, b]              solution_list.append(solution)          for item in solution_list:             item = sorted(item)         solution_list = set(solution_list)      if len(solution_list)&gt;0:         print("These are the solutions:")         for solution in solution_list:             print(solution)         print()     else:         print("There are unfortunately no solutions to your number.", end="\n\n") </code></pre>
