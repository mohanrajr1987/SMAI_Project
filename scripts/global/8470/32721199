<p>I have a simple question about how to do a set operation efficiently in C++.</p>  <p>Suppose I have two containers. What I'd like is the union of these containers with an extra step in which I do something special to the elements of either container that are not in both.</p>  <p>One way to do this would be to construct the set_symmetric_difference, then do a set_union. Is there a way to do this that has less overhead?</p>  <p>I'm actually doing this operation as an accumulation through N containers, so if there is an extra trick to help there that'd be great!</p>
