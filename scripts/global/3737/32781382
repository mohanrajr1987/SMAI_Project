<p>I have a very weird thing going on in my MVC application. I'm rendering a partial view into a bootstrap popup. The controller action looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>[HttpGet]     public ActionResult GetModalForm(int id)     {         var vm = CreateViewModel(id)         return PartialView("MyPartialView", vm);     } </code></pre>  <p>This seems to work fine, the view model has two fields in it:</p>  <pre><code> public class MyViewModel {     public int id { get; set; }     public int MemberId {get ; set;} } </code></pre>  <p>So far so good, when I put a break point in the Controller action, the id and MemberId fields are set correctly.</p>  <p>Now here's where things get wacky, I have the following lines in my partial view (for testing the issue):</p>  <pre><code>@using () {     @Html.TextBox("id", Model.id)     @Html.TextBox("something", Model.id)     &lt;input type='submit'/&gt; } </code></pre>  <p>When this renders, the 1st line gives me a text box with a value equal to the MemberId field, the 2nd line gives me a value equal to the id field. I don't really understand how these two lines can be giving me different values for the same field. What's weird is why is the second line reading the MemberId field?</p>  <p>Has anyone seen anything like this before, or have any ideas what might be causing it? I'm reaching my wit's end.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance for any help.</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>  <p>To help explain what is happening further: If my view model properties are id=x and MemberId=y. Then the following line:</p>  <pre><code>@Html.HiddenFor(m =&gt; m.id) </code></pre>  <p>Will render as:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;input type="hidden" id="id" name="id" value="y"/&gt; </code></pre>
