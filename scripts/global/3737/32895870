<p>I'm building an Umbraco 7.2.8 website</p>  <p>Under installation Models or Controllers folders didn't exist so I added them.</p>  <p>I added a model class to Models folder:</p>  <pre><code>namespace MyNamespace.Models {     public class QuoteRequest     {         public int People { get; set; }          public int Days { get; set; }     } } </code></pre>  <p>When I'm trying to use it in a view I get error <code>The type or namespace name 'MyNamespace' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)</code></p>  <pre><code>@using MyNamespace.Models </code></pre>  <p>My controller doesn't see it either. Why is that? What do I miss?</p>  <p>I tried to compile the project but with no effect. The project is compiling but no <code>MyNamespace.dll</code> is placed in bin folder.</p>
