<p>Hello everyone I need to create some dynamic forms so users can configure feeds to their specification.</p>  <p>I have used ng-repeat to do the following:</p>  <ol> <li>For each feed a user needs to configure a new tab is created</li> <li><p>for each property a feed has a label and input textbox is created. Markup:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;tabset&gt; &lt;tab ng-repeat="feed in feeds" heading="{{feed.heading}}"&gt;     &lt;form role="form"&gt;         &lt;div class="row" ng-repeat="property in feed.properties"&gt;             &lt;div class="col-xs-6"&gt;                 &lt;div class="input-group"&gt;                     &lt;span class="input-group-addon"&gt;                         &lt;span&gt;{{property.name}}&lt;/span&gt;                     &lt;/span&gt;                     &lt;input type="text" class="form-control" value="{{property.value}}"&gt;                 &lt;/div&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;         &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;/form&gt;  &lt;/tab&gt;&lt;/tabset&gt; </code></pre></li> </ol>  <p>This works just fine with the backing json that I have however I am wondering what the accepted way of capturing the data for this kind of use case, obviously I won't know how many feeds or properties each feed has so I suppose I need to bind this to an array in some way.</p>  <p>The question is how?</p>
