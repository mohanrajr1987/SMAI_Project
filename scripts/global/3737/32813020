<p>I have built a Form with autocomplete control.  After selecting an entry in autocomplete the values of two hidden fields are being set with ("#fieldName").val() method like </p>  <p>$("#managerID").val(data.Id);</p>  <p>When the form is posted the values of the hidden fields are not in the model. The value entered in the autocomplete field is.</p>  <p>When I change the fields to visible textboxes I get the same effect.</p>  <p>Although when I enter data in the textbox manually the value is getting posted to the controller.</p>  <p>What is hindering the values set with val() method from being posted to the controller model?</p>  <p>Thanks for help</p>
