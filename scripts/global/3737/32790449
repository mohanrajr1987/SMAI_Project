<p>I have a model similar to this</p>  <pre><code>class Item(models.Model):     value = models.IntegerField()     words = models.CharField(max_length=512, unique=True) </code></pre>  <p>I would like to be able to search through the objects, and return he best matches for a specific query. 'Best match' can be defined as the closest text based result to the <code>words</code> field, (I can write a function that returns an integer representation of 'closeness' no problem, the model search and cacheing are the problems).</p>  <p>Ideally, each time a search is made, if it has been made before, only new elements since the last time the query was made should be searched (the other results have already been cached). I can not find a django module that achieves this.</p>  <p>Some info:   DB: postgres   Connector: psycopg2</p>
