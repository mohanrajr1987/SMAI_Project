<p>I want to develop a sensor application that accepts real time data, but I want to use Model-view-controller architecture. </p>  <p>MVC architectures were mainly considered for the web development, however related to sensor based applications there is not much guidance up to my knowledge.</p>  <p>I want to know that if I sense data from sensors in my controller would it be possible to sense and send the data to the remote location (I mean to save in some database) using my queries at the same time? Or I have to save that data in my Models first as those are my domain objects. So I am passing the same objects data to the database using queries. </p>  <p>I would like to share that the database will be at a remote location where I shall save that data, so in this case it can be a network application. So my possible controller will interact the database remotely.</p>  <p>I know the question is broad but it would be good if the downvoters would ask for some specific details as MVC is quite new to me especially in the domain of sensor applications. </p>
