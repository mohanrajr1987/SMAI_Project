<p>I wanted to create an ANT Script to create build in one click for my Flex Mobile Project. My app using some native extension file(.ane). When I tried to run the ANT script it saying - </p>  <pre><code>An implementation for native extension 'com.example.mobile.extensions.NativeFeature' required by the application was not found for the target platform  </code></pre>  <p>I am using below code to include ane file in ANT Script.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;compiler.external-library-path dir="${basedir}/ane" append="true"&gt;                    &lt;include name="**/*.ane"/&gt;                &lt;/compiler.external-library-path&gt;  </code></pre>  <p>Also added the same extensionId in myApp-app.xml file which I used in my extension.xml file.</p>
