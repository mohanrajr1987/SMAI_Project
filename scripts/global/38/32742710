<p>I have an application in Flex with Java backend.</p>  <p>In this application , I have a java rest service that returns a date of birth . On the java side , this data is returned as, for example, 10/10/2000. The problem is that when this date arrives on the Flex side , it comes as 09/10/2000. I debug the date in Flex, and realized that the 'dateUTC' attribute is 10, but the 'date' attribute is 09. Why these two attributes are different?</p>  <p>This problem only happens with dates between 10/10/2000 and 10/22/2000 . Has anyone experienced this kind of thing?</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
