<p>I have a JSON service link that returns month as an    <code>Integer</code> and a price as a    <code>Number</code> which i display on an    <code>&lt; mx:Linechart /> </code>.</p>  <p>Now, I don't want to display the month as an <code>Integer</code> instead as the string equivalent of the month value.</p>  <p>I have tried to create a datafunction like so</p>  <pre><code>public function myDataFunction(series:LineSeries, item:Object, fieldName:String):Object {             var months:Array = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"];             var my_date:Date = new Date();              if (fieldName == 'yValue')                 return(item.price);             else if (fieldName == "xValue")             {                 return((months[my_date.month]));             }             else                 return null;         } </code></pre>  <p>I would like to post reputations but i don't have enough reputations. Anybody please help.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
