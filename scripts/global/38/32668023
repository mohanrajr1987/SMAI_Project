<p>In the Spark BorderContainer component the border sides and corner radius styles were not copied over from the halo component set (see <a href="http://sourceforge.net/adobe/flexsdk/wiki/Spark%20BorderContainer/" rel="nofollow">here</a>). </p>  <p>Specifically:  </p>  <ul> <li>borderSides (left, top, bottom, right)  </li> <li>cornerRadius(TL/TR/BL/BR)  </li> <li>borderThickness(Left/Right/Top/Bottom) * optional  </li> <li>backgroundAttachment (fixed, scroll) * optional</li> </ul>  <p>I've been trying to add them manually but I'm having some difficulty. </p>  <p>I've brought over some code from the HaloBorder.as skin and it is sortof working except it is appearing behind the background fill. </p>  <p>It's a lot of code so I pasted it <a href="http://pastebin.com/etDu0g6p" rel="nofollow">here</a>. </p>  <p>BTW That code was my first approach. But it looks like I could use the insetPath that is already there to draw border. <em>That would be <strong>better</em></strong> since it allows me to set all the stroke properties but I don't know how to write path data so I'd have to learn that as well. But at this point I'd be happy to get anything working. </p>  <p><strong>Update:</strong><br> I found a class that has some methods for generating curved border path data. Look in spark/skins/spark/TabBarButtonSkin.mxml. You can see the code <a href="https://code.google.com/p/tlfeditor/source/browse/InstantMessagerAir/src/com/hjx/im/view/skin/TabBarButtonSkin.mxml?r=224" rel="nofollow">here</a>, in the createPathData() method. </p>
