<p>I have an mx:DataGrid using mx:Application type. Here's the setup:</p>  <ul> <li>textInput for quantity </li> <li>product quantity column, in the dataGrid, that takes the qty from the textInput and does some calculations with the price column</li> <li>sumTotal variable to get the totals. This is shown outside the dataGrid</li> </ul>  <p>Some of the product quantity fields already exist from an xml file and some qty's are being populated from the textInput field. </p>  <p><strong>Issue</strong>: If the product fields, with the qty fields that are tied to the textInput, are not visible the sumTotal doesn't update. So if the grid get's sorted or if someone scrolled away from it the new total does't get populated. Essentially I always end up needing to scroll to those row and click anywhere on the datagrid for it to register teh change. Anyway I can get those updates to register without having to do this?</p>  <p>Thanks! --moe</p>
