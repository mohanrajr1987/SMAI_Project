<p>I'm trying to export a release build of a project that includes folders for assets, VO, controllers, models, and view. When I export a release build, the release build is not including all the files and folders that are in the project root in flex builder. It only includes the main flex application files as well as the assets and controllers folder. Is there a way to resolve this?</p>
