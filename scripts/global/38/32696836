<p>Maybe somebody knows about the best way to implement data binding in CreateJS? E.g. when changes of properties in ClassA call some listener-functions in ClassB ?</p>  <p>In Flash(Flex) it's possible to use some meta-tags to tell compiler which properties should be used as bindable. After that, during compilation compiler makes some changes in the code (e.g. wraps the required properties into get/set methods, and in the set methods there are dispatching events functionality).</p>  <p>Do we have something similar in CreateJS?</p>  <p>How it works in AS3 (a very simple example):</p>  <pre><code>public class ClassA {     [Bindable]     public var bindableProperty:String; }  public class ClassB {     protected var classA:ClassA;      public function GameModel()     {         this.classA = new ClassA();         BindingUtils.bindSetter(this.bindingCallback, this.classA, "bindableProperty");     }      public function bindingCallback()     {         // Do something after binding callback     } } </code></pre>
