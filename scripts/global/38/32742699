<p>I have an <code>adobe flex</code> application that shows an embedded webpage with <code>mx:HTML</code> component.</p>  <p>The webpage has a dropdown. It should be possible to scroll within this dropdown when it's open using, the mouse wheel.</p>  <p>Problem: always the full webpage is scrolled, and the dropdown closes instantly. It's impossible to scroll within (only would have to use the vertical slider manually for this).</p>  <p>Question: is it possible at all to use mouse for scrolling in an embedded webpage in flex?</p>
