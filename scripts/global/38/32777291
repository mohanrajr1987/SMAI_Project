<p>This is <strong>not</strong> a duplicate question, I will post the links to the questions whose 'accepted' answers did not work for me.</p>  <p>I have been trying to <em>integrate</em> a third party library for my flex android application for a few weeks now, with no success. Unfortunately there is no reliable end-to-end documentation for the same. What <a href="http://help.adobe.com/en_US/air/extensions/WSf268776665d7970d-2e74ffb4130044f3619-7ff8.html" rel="nofollow">little</a> Adobe has documented on the topic is insufficient to say the least.</p>  <p>The tools I am using:</p>  <ol> <li>ADT to package ANE from command line on Windows 7.</li> <li>Flash Builder to package the final APK (ANE with the flash part)</li> </ol>  <p>My directory structure for the ANE:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8NJWz.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8NJWz.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>The ADT command I am using:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;Adt path&gt;\adt -package -storetype PKCS12 -keystore ./cert.p12 -storepass &lt;password&gt; -target ane myane.ane ./build/ane/extension.xml -swc ./build/ane/*.swc -platform Android-ARM -platformoptions platform.xml -C ./build/ane/Android-ARM/ . -platform Android-x86 \ -C ./build/ane/Android-ARM/ . </code></pre>  <p>Here are a few questions on Stack Overflow that I did refer to and which did not work for me:</p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7732742/air-3-native-extensions-for-android-can-i-how-to-include-3rd-party-libraries">Question#1</a>: Accepted answer is to simply combine both JAR files using the JAR tool in java. It did not work for me, I get a NoClassDefFound error when trying to access any class inside ThirdPartyJar.jar. I export my Native Jar from Eclipse like this:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ki7zP.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ki7zP.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/STn1a.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/STn1a.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>My doubt here is, in combining the two JARs <strong>where did I define the dependency?</strong> How is a simple combination of JARs working for others who have accepted the answer?</p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24626380/how-to-include-additional-jar-in-android-native-extension-for-adobe-air-mobile">Question#2</a> : The accepted answer here talks about creating a platform options XML which defines the said 'packaged dependency'. Seems more logical. I tried to create it, as visible in my folder structure above and the adt command I am using. Here's how the 'platform.xml' looks:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;platform xmlns="http://ns.adobe.com/air/extension/4.0"&gt;     &lt;packagedDependencies&gt;         &lt;packagedDependency&gt;ThirdPartyJar.jar&lt;/packagedDependency&gt;     &lt;/packagedDependencies&gt;     &lt;packagedResources&gt;     &lt;/packagedResources&gt; &lt;/platform&gt; </code></pre>  <p>At first, I was getting an 'Namespace should be same as extension.xml' error while trying to build the ANE, but after I changed both of them to '...../4.0' I could build the ANE without any errors. However, when I included the ANE in my Flex Project, and tried to Run As > Mobile Application, it would give me this error:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/I7s9E.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/I7s9E.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I would then rename the strings.xml file in my Android Native Project, re-build the ANE, to get this error:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/vgiG3.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/vgiG3.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>How do I get it to work? Between these two solutions I have tried myriad ways to package the two JARs together but it just would not work!</p>
