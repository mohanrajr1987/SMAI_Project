<p>Recently, I have bought some ANE and there was a big problem installing them in FlashDevelop, and guys from Distriqt suggest me to use Flash Builder. When I transfer my AS3 code to FlashBulider (not Flex project), it won't compile, cause there were no mx functions... like:</p>  <pre><code>mx.utils.Base64Encoder mx.graphics.codec.JPEGEncoder </code></pre>  <p>and my code won't compile.</p>  <p>Any idea how to setup FlashBuilder to use those functions in non-flex project?</p>
