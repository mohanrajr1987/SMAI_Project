<p>One of my component already has 9 states and I add one more to it.</p>  <p>It works well when I debug but this component is not working in a right way when I deploy the release version swf. And it shows like this component is in a wrong state.</p>  <p><br/></p>  <p>What quite confuses me is that the debug version swf works well while release version one fails.</p>  <p>And after I rollback the codes it works well again.</p>  <p><br/></p>  <p>So I guess that the translater has done something wrong when I try to release the swf. Maybe there exists a maximum of states for release version?</p>
