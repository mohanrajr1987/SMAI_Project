<p>I might have wrongly titled my question, but basically, on execution my flex application displays this <strong>AIS Queue list</strong> as follows:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/jHeOS.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/jHeOS.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>One can see the huge gap between the links at the top(<strong>Home, News</strong> etc) and the <strong>AIS Queue list</strong> heading. On the left of <strong>AIS Queue table</strong>, I have rounded off the <strong>MENU</strong> option. On bringing my mouse over it, the UI changes as below(It expands the Menu): </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/gs0uZ.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/gs0uZ.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Now, the <strong>AIS Queue list</strong> content has shifted to its normal position(where it should be in the page).  I want this content to be in it's normal position even when the left menu is not expanded. Is this a flex issue or some resolution problem?</p>
