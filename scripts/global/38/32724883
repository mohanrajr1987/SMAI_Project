<p>I have an air application that I have developed that only I use at the moment. It works fine but I have recently got a 4K monitor and am annoyed at the applications that are not written to support the custom DPI settings in windows that you use to make sure that text is actually still readable on this high DPI screen.</p>  <p>...it turns out that my application is not written to support this...</p>  <p>Can I get hold of the custom DPI value and use that somehow?</p>  <p>I have used the applicationDPI setting when developing for mobile before but it does not seem to help much here. I have set it to 120, the lowest and the application is still tiny. If I set it higher it gets even smaller.</p>
