<p>I have do do something like this (please forgive me about the stupidity of the example... :-):</p>  <pre><code>var dateRef = new Date(1990, 1, 1); Person.findOneAndUpdate({ dateOfBirth &gt; dateRef }, { $set: { isYoung: true } }, function (err, doc) { }); </code></pre>  <p>I.e.: I'd like to $set isYoung field of every Person document to true for all the persons whose date of birth (<code>dateOfBirth</code>) is later than a reference date.</p>  <p>My code is syntactically wrong, of course...</p>  <p>So the question is: <em>is there a method to do what I ask? Id' prefer it to be an atomic (?) operation (as opposite to a for(...) loop...).</em></p>
