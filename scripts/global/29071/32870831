<p>Using Mongoose for MongoDB I store several collections of data which are defined each by a Mongoose schema. </p>  <p>1) Is there an easy way (without explicitly querying the database) to find out whether a specific property is part of a particular collection schema model?</p>  <p>Lets say I have a collection of users, including information about name and address. At runtime I - for mistake - receive data which is supposed to be stored in the user's document but does not (fully) comply with the schema (e. g. shoe size is included). </p>  <p>2) I know that Mongoose refuses to save the data set in that case but how and at all do I get some sort of feedback about that to report back appropriately to the client?</p>
