<p>Hi there I have a document structure that looks like this.</p>  <pre><code>  Users = [   {     _id: 32339457349878493,     books: [       "Harry Potter",       "Lord of the Rings",       "Life of Pi"     ]   },   {     _id: 32339457349878493,     books: [       "Life of Pi",       "The Alchemist",       "Mocking Jay"     ]   },    {     _id: 32339457349878493,     books: [       "Harry Potter",       "Life of Pi",       "The Alchemist",      ]   },    ] </code></pre>  <p>I want to make a query ["Harry Potter", "Life of Pi"] which will return me the documents that contains both of these books.</p>  <p>So in this case, the first and third records will be returned!</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
