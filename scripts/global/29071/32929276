<p>So Mongoose 4 <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose/issues/2793" rel="nofollow">has changed</a> <code>.findAndUpdate</code> behavior to return the <strong>old</strong> document by default, and if you want the new updated one you need to pass <code>{new:true}</code>, <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose/issues/2262" rel="nofollow">because that was the actual behavior in MongoDB</a>.</p>  <p>But to me it makes more sense to have <code>findAndUpdate</code> return the <strong><em>new</em></strong> document by default.</p>  <p>Is there a way to set that option as a default in all of Mongoose? so that you don't have to pass {new:true} with every findAndUpdate?</p>  <p>edit: Found an <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19183886/mongoose-is-there-a-way-to-default-lean-to-true-always-on/19186230#19186230">answer here</a> which is to patch Query to setOption whatever you want.</p>
