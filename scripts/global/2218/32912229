<p>I've created my own blog and I implemented the facebook comment plugin. But somehow i can't delete other peoples post on it. I've seen 500 movies with developer app, entering my profile id and stuff and it still doesn't work.</p>  <p>HELP, can you show me an example that works? cause facebook doesn't make this easy.</p>
