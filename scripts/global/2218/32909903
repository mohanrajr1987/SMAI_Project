<p>I recently used <strong>omniauth-facebook</strong> gem for my web app. Now i works well for authentication and for fetching users profile picture. After logging in i want to get the users friends list in a dropdown when a text field is clicked so he can choose any one. </p>  <p>And for that i need their friends list first.</p>  <p>Here is the gem file i am using</p>  <pre><code>gem 'omniauth-facebook', '~&gt; 1.4.1' </code></pre>  <p>But how to get list of facebook friends using this gem?</p>
