<p>The situation:  I created an Extended Page Access Token to get the feed from one of my pages. It works.</p>  <p>The problem:  I get the feed but without filed for the link to the facebook page ("view on facebook") or fields for pictures etc.</p>  <p>Attempt at a solution: I looked at a wordpress plugin which does what I want to achieve. They do nothing different than me. I tried one of their standard access tokens and tried them in the api graph explorer. Everything works.</p>  <p>This means the solution lies in the access tokens. </p>  <p>So I created a new one with all permissions checked. Still I don't get the fields I want.</p>  <p>How can I get full information of my fb stream?</p>
