<p>What I need is more of a guide and I hope you can help me. </p>  <p>I have recently used a facebook custom share in each line of a table on my website.  I used the code I found here <a href="http://help.woobox.com/customer/portal/articles/961650-creating-a-custom-share-button" rel="nofollow">Custom share code</a></p>  <p>Everything works fine with that, BUT I found out that you can use this "share" only if you are connected to your facebook profile and it's important to me to be able to use it also with your facebook page. The message I got was "To continue, you'll need to switch from using Facebook as"</p>  <p>So I'm researching all day long, but I need a guide to avoid mistakes. I will make the start so you can get the step that I am into.</p>  <p>1) Followed the instructions I found <a href="http://www.devils-heaven.com/facebook-access-tokens/" rel="nofollow">there</a></p>  <p>To be more specific I visited facebook devs -> tools and support ->  Graph API Explorer</p>  <p>2) Get access token -> extended permissions -> manage_pages (it was already enabled but I may have done it before without knowing what I was doing)</p>  <p>3) Get page access token for my facebook page</p>  <p>I still can't share as a facebook page</p>  <p>PS. I just figured out that following the steps I mentioned will enable the "share" only on my page.</p>  <p>So I am redefining my question  </p>  <p>"How can I enable users, use my custom share, with their facebook pages and not only with their facebook profiles" </p>
