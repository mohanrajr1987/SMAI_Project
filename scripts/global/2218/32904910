<p>Thank to Firebase the user can logged with the help of G+, Facebook or Twitter. When they are logged, everything is fine.</p>  <p>When the Android app is closed and re-opened, how to reenable the previous succeed logged user with the Firebase API. It is not explained neither in the app demo or in the documentation.</p>  <p>For exemple for Facebook, the sdk seems to save the token, that 's why the button is at connected state (showing that you can disconnect). But what about Firebase and for other authentication systems.</p>
