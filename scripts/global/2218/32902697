<p>I am trying to create a page in facebook where people can change their profile picture to a certain picture to support the awareness of the refugees of Syria.</p>  <p>I have an example of what I'd like to do here: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/celebratepride?_rdr" rel="nofollow">https://www.facebook.com/celebratepride?_rdr</a></p>  <p>What I am trying to understand is how can you get a facebook page where you can put your own script on? Is there special documentation about this or do you request the app on the developer.facebook.com page?</p>
