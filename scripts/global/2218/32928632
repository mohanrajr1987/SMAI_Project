<p>I use this code to share a link to my app using android intent:</p>  <pre><code>Intent sendIntent = new Intent(); sendIntent.setAction(Intent.ACTION_SEND); String lnk = "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?referrer=utm_source=vk&amp;utm_medium=share&amp;utm_content=ASD23234343FFGGD&amp;utm_campaign=ingame_share&amp;id=com.my.super.app"; sendIntent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT, lnk); sendIntent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_SUBJECT, "Use this link to install my super app!"); sendIntent.setType("text/plain"); mainContext.startActivity(Intent.createChooser(sendIntent, "What to choose?")); </code></pre>  <p><strong>Question1</strong></p>  <p>When intent is received by installed app Vk on Vkontakte's wall I see my link with some scaring picture near it - <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/6x2S0.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/6x2S0.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a>.  It's not mine picture, no idea what it is at all!  When I change package name to another, I see another strange picture with the same dimentions. What can I add to extra to get rid of this strange picture? Or at least give Vk link to my picture?</p>  <p><strong>Question2</strong></p>  <p>When intent is received by installed app Facebook on Facebook's wall I see my link without any other parameters except id:</p>  <pre><code>http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.my.super.app </code></pre>  <p>I tried to Uri.encode the link, but it becomes broken. Changing parameters order doesn't help either. Is there way to share link on Facebook with referrer parameters? The same thing if I use share link:</p>  <pre><code>"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=" + Uri.encode(lnk) + "&amp;t=" + Uri.encode(text) </code></pre>  <p>But if I post link <a href="https://example.com/index.php" rel="nofollow">https://example.com/index.php</a>? and add all the parameters, Facebook leave link as is. It looks like evil creature somehow hates Google Play and don't want to allow its refferal links :)  Does anybody know how to manage this except redirect?</p>
