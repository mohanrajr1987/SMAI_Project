<p>“Someone messaged on Facebook from a fake account telling on my boyfriend. He called some of my friends fat and racist and comments bad things on my album pictures. I have a feeling its one of the people i know. Can Facebook trace the IP Address of this person to find out who the hell is this? I’ve sent a message to Facebook but they are slow responders. I need to know now. Please help!</p>  <p>Note : Please send me solution clearly.</p>
