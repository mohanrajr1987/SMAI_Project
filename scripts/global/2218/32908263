<p>Using a theme that calls in other pages and posts so that they all appear on one 'page' I wonder if this is why I get redirect errors from Facebook / Open Graph Data.</p>  <p>Facebook says: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Could not follow redirect path...these are the redirects we had to follow: </p> </blockquote>  <ol> <li>original - <a href="http://sethums.com/the-book" rel="nofollow">http://sethums.com/the-book</a></li> <li>301 - <a href="http://sethums.com/the-book" rel="nofollow">http://sethums.com/the-book</a></li> <li>og:url - same thing</li> </ol>  <p>Why if the urls are identical is there a redirect? And what can be done to make the correct data appear? I'm using Yoast's SEO for Wordpress plugin. And filled in the social data. </p>  <p>Any thoughts appreciated.</p>
