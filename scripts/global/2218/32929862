<p>When django-allauth is integrated with web app, clicking "facebook login" button will pop up a window saying:</p>  <p><strong>XXX will receive the following info: your public profile and email address. Edit the info you provide</strong> </p>  <p>Is there a way to disable this pop-up window so that users will log in immediately to web app homepage after click the "facebook login" button? Any example code snippets will be much appreciated.</p>
