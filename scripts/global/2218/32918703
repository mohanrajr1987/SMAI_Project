<p>I have a facebook account. Is that my facebook profile? I'm a bit confused about what I can and can't do with a business page .What I think I understand is that the business page has to be a real entity, organization, celebrity, non-profit.  I made a business page based on a non-profit that I like but I'm not affiliated with. I'm not a part of the business. Is that allowed? How do build a presence on facebook through a business page about anything that I want to promote? </p>
