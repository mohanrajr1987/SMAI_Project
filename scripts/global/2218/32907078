<p>I got below error after updating my X Code to the latest version:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>ld: '/Users/mimicreative/Documents/Kerja/Backup/FacebookSDK/FBSDKMessengerShareKit.framework/FBSDKMessengerShareKit(FBSDKMessengerApplicationStateManager.o)' does not contain bitcode. You must rebuild it with bitcode enabled (Xcode setting ENABLE_BITCODE), obtain an updated library from the vendor, or disable bitcode for this target. for architecture armv7</p> </blockquote>  <p>However i dont got this error on the earlier version of X Code. And that error happened when I archive my project.</p>  <p>Does anyone know how to fix this problem?</p>
