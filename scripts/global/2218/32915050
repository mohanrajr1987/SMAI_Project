<p>When I paste url in Update Status on Facebook, it does not pull the right data from the meta open graphics.  I've used FB's Object Debugger (<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/og/object/" rel="nofollow">https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/og/object/</a>) and all appears to be working fine except when they show the preview: it shows a messy title. Any idea what the problem is?</p>  <p>-Richard</p>
