<p>On trying to use Facebook's Graph API explorer to view saved links, as suggested by many answers before, I tried to run a  <code>GET /v2.4/me/save.saves</code> with all permissions granted. It returns this however:</p>  <p><code>{"data": [  ] }</code></p>  <p>I've also noticed that a number of people with a similar question have been asked to run save.saves and have received a null result post which there has been no resolution thus leading to this roadblock.</p>
