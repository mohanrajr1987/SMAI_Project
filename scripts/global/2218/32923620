<p>I have a AJAX-heavy web site and wanted to make it more search engine friendly. I read the following articles <a href="https://developers.google.com/webmasters/ajax-crawling/docs/specification" rel="nofollow">1</a>,<a href="http://blog.christoffer.me/post/2013-04-20-how-to-make-spa-websites-more-search-friendly/#.Vg_SyhrR_VQ" rel="nofollow">2</a> and others, know that Google finds links with "#!" will convert into "_escaped_fragment_", so I wrote a javascript to create and store snapshot of pages dynamically.<br>  for example:<br> The original page ( pretty URL )<br> <a href="http://54.254.240.142/#!/article?uid=Sample-daad6i1m7kacerk9&amp;search=" rel="nofollow">http://54.254.240.142/#!/article?uid=Sample-daad6i1m7kacerk9&amp;search=</a><br> will create a snapshot in the following link ( ugly URL )<br> <a href="http://54.254.240.142/_escape_fragment_/article%3Fuid%3DSample-daad6i1m7kacerk9" rel="nofollow">http://54.254.240.142/_escape_fragment_/article%3Fuid%3DSample-daad6i1m7kacerk9</a><br></p>  <p>However, Google can not fetch it, Facebook can't fetch it either. <br> Umm I am not sure the format of URL mapping between pretty and ugly URLs.  Any hints or tips would be appreciated.<br> Thanks.</p>
