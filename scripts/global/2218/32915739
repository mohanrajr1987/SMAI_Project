<p>I'm following basic examples for authenticating with Facebook using ASP.NET Identity, such as <a href="http://www.oauthforaspnet.com/providers/facebook/guides/aspnet-mvc5/" rel="nofollow">http://www.oauthforaspnet.com/providers/facebook/guides/aspnet-mvc5/</a>. Facebook does not seem to be providing a login token - I'm not getting the notification telling me about what info the app will get. Also, I'm not getting redirected back to the "Register" page, I just get redirected back to the login page.</p>
