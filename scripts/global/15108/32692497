<p>I have a django email form that posts to a URL which in turn redirects to another and renders a success/failure html.</p>  <p>I am using the Django Messaging framework to display success/failure messages on the form submission status.</p>  <p>All this works except when the user reloads the status page, the message is popped and I get a blank screen.</p>  <p>I am wondering what the correct treatment for this scenario is. Should I redirect to homepage if there are no messages, or maybe have a generic two-liner as a fail-safe?</p>  <p>PS: If this is not an appropriate question on SO, kindly recommend an alternate site for me to ask this question, I couldn't find any.</p>
