<p>Suppose I have this formset.</p>  <pre><code>FormSet = modelformset_factory(Phone, fields=('phone', ), can_delete=True, extra=1, validate_min=True, min_num=1) </code></pre>  <p>Next, suppose I have edit form, one phone field (one form) is filled and one extra is empty. </p>  <p>If I choose delete for first and leave second empty, this will work and everything will be deleted, so min_num is violated.</p>  <p>How to properly handle this situation?</p>
