<p>I am trying to male a django webapp; the app has several forms that are submitted by users and I was wondering if there was a way to tell which user submitted the form so that I could bind the form input to that particular user. The form is for an "appointment" as if the patient that were logged in is making an appointment to go see their doctor. Model:</p>  <pre><code>     class Appointment(models.Model):          user = models.OneToOneField(User)          schedule = models.ForeignKey(Schedule)          doctorName = models.CharField(max_length=50)          date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True) </code></pre>  <p>Form:</p>  <pre><code>     class CreateAppointment(forms.ModelForm):          class Meta:              model = Appointment              fields = ("doctorName", "date") </code></pre>  <p>View:</p>  <pre><code>    def create_appointment(request):         if request.POST:             form = CreateAppointmentForm(request.POST, instance=request.user.profile)             if form.is_valid():                form.save()             return render_to_response('index.html', context_instance=RequestContext(request))         else:            form = CreateAppointmentForm()          args = {}         args.update(csrf(request))          args['form'] = form         return render_to_response('create_appointment.html', args, context_instance=RequestContext(request)) </code></pre>
