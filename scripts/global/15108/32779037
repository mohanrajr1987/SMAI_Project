<p>I am using django 1.7 &amp; python 2.7.</p>  <p>I have a model class which allows a text area and text box input for the user. </p>  <p><code>If</code> the user selects 0 in a select list, <code>then</code> the text box is displayed to the user for input and the text area is hidden <code>else</code> the text area is displayed and the text box hidden from the user. </p>  <p>Both the text box and text area have the exact same input. What ever is entered into the text box appears in the text area amd versa vise.</p>  <p>Both the text box and text area have different maxlength/max_length values.</p>  <p>The text box has a maximum length of 250 and the text area has a maximum length of 5000.</p>  <p>I have the client side validation working, but I am having difficulty getting the server side validation working.</p>  <p><strong>How do I enable / disable the server side validation to my model on the forms.py file when the text box and text area have different max_length values, but the same input lengths?</strong></p>  <p>I understand that the max_length can be assigned on the forms.py, but I cannot get the code syntax correct.</p>  <p>Here is my models.py code:</p>  <pre><code>workplace_training_display_type = models.PositiveIntegerField(.....) workplace_training_certificationTB = models.CharField(null=False, blank=False) workplace_training_certificationTA = models.TextField(null=False, blank=False) </code></pre>  <p>Normally I would drop the <code>max_length=250</code> to the <code>workplace_training_certificationTB</code> and the <code>max_length=5000</code> to the <code>workplace_training_certificationTA</code> on the above model fields. However, I believe that this has to be done dynamically in the forms.py file.</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong> If I set the max_length to the models for both the <code>workplace_training_certificationTB</code> and <code>workplace_training_certificationTA</code>, because both fields have exactly the same input, then one of the server side validations will be triggered, which is why I would like to set the values dynamically.</p>  <p>Here is my forms.py file code:</p>  <pre><code>def clean(self):      cd_wrtdf = super(WorkplaceRelatedTrainingDetailsForm, self).clean()      if 'workplace_training_display_type' in cd_wrtdf and cd_wrtdf['workplace_training_display_type'] != 0:          #  if the workplace_training_display_type is not zero, remove the max_length=250 from the textbox.          #  if the workplace_training_display_type is not zero, add the max_length=5000 to the textarea.      else:          #  if the workplace_training_display_type is zero, add the max_length=250 to the textbox.          #  if the workplace_training_display_type is zero, remove the max_length=5000 from the textarea.      return cd_wrtdf </code></pre>  <p>I have tried searching SO &amp; Google, but could not find anything helpful.</p>
