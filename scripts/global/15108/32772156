<p>I'm using the stock auth.User model in Django 1.4 and have added user information using a separate and customer <code>Profile</code> model:</p>  <pre><code>class Profile(models.Model):     user = models.OneToOneField("auth.User")     phone_number = models.CharField(blank=True, null=False) </code></pre>  <p>I create my users with their profile data using a single view with two forms. Since there is a lot of common code between the create and update views, I've factored this out. Everything works as it should in the update view and I am able to update any field from the <code>Profile</code> or <code>User</code> models using a single html web form. The problems come when I try to create users with <code>Profile</code> data.</p>  <p>Here's the problematic code in my DRY parent class that both the <code>UserCreateView</code> and <code>UserUpdateView</code> views inherit from:</p>  <pre><code>class UserFormView(object):     def post(self, request, *args, **kwargs):         self.object = self.get_object()         form_class = self.get_form_class()         form = self.get_form(form_class)         if self.object is not None:             profile_form = \                 ProfileForm(self.request.POST, instance=self.object.profile)         else:             profile_form = ProfileForm(self.request.POST)         if form.is_valid() and profile_form.is_valid():             return self.form_valid(form, profile_form)         else:             return self.form_invalid(form, profile_form)      def form_valid(self, form, profile_form):         self.object = form.save()          # Update the corresponding Profile.         profile_form.instance = self.object.profile         profile_form.save()         return HttpResponseRedirect(self.get_success_url()) </code></pre>  <p>I overwrite the instance on the form because I'm not sure if the instance exists (I might be updating or creating), and if I'm creating, the instance will be created automatically when the <code>User</code> object is saved.</p>  <p>Problem is, when I attempt to create a user with profile data, none of the profile data saves. I'm able to then update the user and add profile data, but for some reason, the instance on the form doesn't seem to be set right during creation.</p>  <p>Any help is appreciated.</p>
