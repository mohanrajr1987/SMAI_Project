<p>I have the following code:</p>  <pre><code>user=User.objects.get(username=uid) </code></pre>  <p>I pass the value for uid via url "/profile/showprofile/{{post.author}}". My post.author contains value as "dean88".</p>  <p>When run the form and click on the link with the above mentioned url. i get an error saying <b>invalid literal for int with base 10 "dean88"</b>.  </p>  <p>But when i go to python shell and give: user=User.objects.get(username='dean88') i still get the same error. The error goes only when i enter the id of the user as integer. Like, user=User.objects.get(username=2). </p>  <p>What can be the problem and how to avoid it?</p>
