<p>I have a formset (more specifically a generic inline formset) whose forms have an ImageField. After working around what seems to be a few Django bugs, everything is working fine, except that when I fill the blank form with a new image and click <code>save</code>, the page refreshes after the POST request and the new image is not there. The other fields of the form I just saved are there and are properly filled, but the image URL doesn't show up. The database record is saved correctly and if I simply refresh the page, the image shows up correctly. But I can't figure out how to return from the POST with all the newly saved information without having to refresh the page an extra time.</p>  <p>In case it's relevant, for this ImageField I am using a custom Storage class which handles saving the image in a remote server through an API.</p>  <p>A workaround that solves the problem but which in my opinion shouldn't be necessary:</p>  <pre><code>class ProductImagesView(View):     ...     def post(self, request, id):         product = get_object_or_404(Product.objects.by_id(id))         image_formset = ProductImageInlineFormset(             request.POST, request.FILES, instance=product)         if image_formset.is_valid():             image_formset.save()          image_formset = ProductImageInlineFormset(instance=product)  # Workaround         return render(...) </code></pre>  <p>You can find more details about my code in this other question:</p>  <ul> <li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32865691">Django BaseGenericInlineFormSet forms not inheriting FormSet instance as form instance related_object</a></li> </ul>  <p>Any idea why this is happening? Am I doing something wrong or is this a Django bug? Thanks.</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>  <p>One thing I forgot to say: the formset that shows up after saving not only has a blank Image field for the newly created Image object, it also doesn't have the extra blank form for new records that should be there. It also only appears after a refresh.</p>  <p>(I pass <code>extra=1</code> to the <code>generic_inlineformset_factory</code>):</p>  <pre><code>ProductImageInlineFormset = generic_inlineformset_factory(     Image, form=ProductImageForm, extra=1) </code></pre>
