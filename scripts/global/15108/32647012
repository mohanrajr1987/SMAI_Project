<p>I'm trying to add a formset to my a view of my ContactList model that allows a user to filter the contacts in the list. Since the contact fields are customisable per list, I need to pass in the list so that I can retrieve which fields can be filtered upon.</p>  <p>I currently have a form which retrieves the contact_list statically,</p>  <pre><code>class ListFilterForm(forms.Form):     def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):         super(ListFilterForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)         self.contact_list = ContactList.objects.get(id=1)         columns = self.contact_list.get_fields()         column_choices = [(col.get('sort_key'), col.get('field_label')) for index, col in columns.items()]         col_field = forms.ChoiceField(choices=column_choices)         compare_field = forms.ChoiceField(choices=ContactList.LIST_FILTER_CHOICES)         value_field = forms.CharField(max_length=255, required=False)         self.fields['column'] = col_field         self.fields['compare'] = compare_field         self.fields['value'] = value_field </code></pre>  <p>I've spent all afternoon researching methods of passing in the data required and they seem to fall into distinct categories. </p>  <p>1) Use AJAX - This seems unnecessary to me as the list of fields is the same for every filter within the contact list and won't change</p>  <p>2) Use model formsets - Since these are just temporary filters used for searching and won't be stored, this doesn't fit either. </p>  <p>3) Modify the BaseFormSet</p>  <p>The last is where I've focussed my effort and I've found various recommendations including the use of partials to wrap my form and also overriding parts of the BaseFormSet class to include my own keywords args (eg <a href="https://gist.github.com/andrefsp/5115772" rel="nofollow">https://gist.github.com/andrefsp/5115772</a>).</p>  <p>This looked quite promising and should seem to work but it fails when it hits the empty_form since that method doesn't use _construct_form like normal instantiations of the form. </p>  <p>Are there any other methods that has anybody else has successfully used? I'm very surprised that somebody hasn't come up with a good solution yet.</p>
