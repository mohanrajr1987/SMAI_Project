<p>The POST-Redirect-GET pattern is recommended when submitting forms, in order to void resending the POST data if the user does a refresh.  This may be done in the view handling the POST data with code like:</p>  <pre><code>def get_name(request):     if request.method == 'POST':         form = NameForm(request.POST)         if form.is_valid():             interesting_information = 'Feedback after form submit'             return HttpResponseRedirect('/thanks/') </code></pre>  <p>But using this scheme, how is it possible to show <code>interesting_information</code> to the user, which may for example be status information based on the submitted form?</p>
