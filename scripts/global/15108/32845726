<p>I am new to Django. I am trying to create a form at 'example.com/contacts/10/edit' that allows you to edit the details of a contact and then bring you to the detail page of that contact (example.com/contacts/10). 10 in these instances is the default pk.</p>  <p>I have succeeded in displaying a form that edits the contact in the database, but the form is empty in the template and I cannot work out how to populate the form with the data from the database.</p>  <p>The ModelForm I am using - AddForm() - is the same that I use to add a new contact</p>  <p>Here is my code, there is probably some redundant stuff in here so please bear with me. All help is appreciated.</p>  <p>views.py</p>  <pre><code>def EditContact(request, pk):     instance = get_object_or_404(Contact, id=pk)     if request.POST:         form = AddForm(request.POST or None, instance=instance)         if form.is_valid():             form.save()             return HttpResponseRedirect('/contacts/')      else:         form = AddForm()      return render(request, 'contacts/edit.html', {'form': form}) </code></pre>  <p>form in template:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;form action="" method="POST"&gt; {% csrf_token %}     &lt;table&gt;              &lt;p&gt; {{ form.as_ul }}&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/table&gt;      &lt;input type="submit" value="Post"&gt; &lt;/form&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Also I have recently read about generic editing views, maybe someone can tell me if they would be more suitable for what I am trying to achieve - that is, to add, edit and remove contacts from the database. Thanks.</p>
