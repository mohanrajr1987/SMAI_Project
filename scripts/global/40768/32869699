<p>I am using Starscream and Pusher-swift in an app I've made about a month ago with Xcode 6, all was working fine, Pusher connected and was able to receive messages.</p>  <p>After Xcode updated itself to 7 because I forgot to turn off the computer, and after I spent a week sorting out about 19375891237849 errors, now I'm stuck at the Websocket part of the application which simply doesn't want to connect. </p>  <p>No errors are thrown. Pusher thinks it's connected (PusherConnection.connected is set to true) but it can't subscribe to any channel and no errors pop up.</p>  <p>I am looking at the Starscream code, can't seem to manage to figure out what's going on.</p>  <p>Has anyone seen this happening with Xcode 7? </p>  <p>Is there maybe a setting (like for instance that NSAllowsArbitraryLoads setting to allow loading objects via HTTP) that blocks websockets by default? (not that I can imagine why would Apple do such a thing, maybe they started hiring developers from Microsoft or something).</p>
