<p>I am trying to run a WebSocket Server on my Adroid device using QPython. Here is the script - </p>  <pre><code>from websocket_server import WebsocketServer  # Called for every client connecting (after handshake) def new_client(client, server):     print("New client connected and was given id %d" % client['id'])     server.send_message_to_all("Hey all, a new client has joined us")   # Called for every client disconnecting def client_left(client, server):     print("Client(%d) disconnected" % client['id'])   # Called when a client sends a message def message_received(client, server, message):     if len(message) &gt; 200:         message = message[:200]+'..'     print("Client(%d) said: %s" % (client['id'], message))   PORT=9001 server = WebsocketServer(PORT) server.set_fn_new_client(new_client) server.set_fn_client_left(client_left) server.set_fn_message_received(message_received) server.run_forever() </code></pre>  <p>I have tried the script on my desktop and client is able to connect to the server. However, when I try to connect to the Android device using the same script, the client is unable to connect to it. Both my client and android phone are on the same Wifi Network and I am using the IP addresses provided by the Wifi router.</p>
