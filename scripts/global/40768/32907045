<p>I run a long running websocket server using the nodejs-websocket module. During the runtime I sporadically get ETIMEDOUT exception. I catch have a on('uncaughtException') handler on my process which outputs the following:</p>  <pre><code>exception : Error: read ETIMEDOUT Fri Oct 02 2015 01:17:24 GMT+0200 (CEST) Error: read ETIMEDOUT     at errnoException (net.js:904:11)     at TCP.onread (net.js:558:19) </code></pre>  <p>I have an on('error') handler on the server but this does not seems to catch it. I understand what the error means, that during a read from a socket it times out, but I don't understand why. As stated above the server runs for a long time, up to 9 days is the current maximum. Some clients are connected for more or less that entire time.</p>  <p>So my question is why does this happen and how to I handle it in a better way than just catching all uncaughtExceptions.</p>
