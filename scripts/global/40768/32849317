<p>I have to webapps (A and B), both of them are B/S deployed in Tomcat8 with Spring MVC. and of course, I develop these server-side in Java7.</p>  <p>I'm try to send some data from A's server-side to B's server-side via WebSocket. These data is about 10k~200k and will be sent in every 2sec. I thought WebSocket maybe better than RPC/WebService in this scenario.</p>  <p>The problem is: When I send text message using session.sendText, everything is fine. But When I send data using session.sendBinary, I found the session is always be closed. The spring log in B's server-side (B is the websocket server endpoint and who receives the data) is like this:</p>  <pre><code>00:29:29,191 DEBUG OpenEntityManagerInViewFilter:160 - Opening JPA EntityManager in OpenEntityManagerInViewFilter 00:29:29,191 DEBUG TransactionSynchronizationManager:193 - Bound value [org.springframework.orm.jpa.EntityManagerHolder@107c53da] for key [org.springframework.orm.jpa.LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean@25c9b5b9] to thread [http-nio-8081-exec-1] 00:29:29,191 DEBUG TransactionSynchronizationManager:243 - Removed value [org.springframework.orm.jpa.EntityManagerHolder@107c53da] for key [org.springframework.orm.jpa.LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean@25c9b5b9] from thread [http-nio-8081-exec-1] 00:29:29,192 DEBUG OpenEntityManagerInViewFilter:185 - Closing JPA EntityManager in OpenEntityManagerInViewFilter 00:29:29,192 DEBUG EntityManagerFactoryUtils:432 - Closing JPA EntityManager </code></pre>  <p>Every time A's trying to send the data, B's console will print these 5 line log above repeatly. I totally have no idea about where I should check...</p>  <p>It will be super appriciated if I could have your help.</p>  <p>-UPDATE-</p>  <p>In fact, I didn't have muche configuration for using websocket. at B side, as the websocket server, I have the annotation on the class which I want to receive the data like this:</p>  <pre><code>@ServerEndpoint(value = "/report") public class ReportsWebSocketReceiver { ... } </code></pre>  <p>at A side, I use <code>ws://[IP:PORT]/[webappName]/report</code> to connect and send message.</p>  <p>That does work while connecting and sendText message, just doesn't work while sendBinary message.</p>  <p>BTW, It could work if I deploy the receiver class in Tomcat8 without spring, both sendText and sendBinary. So do I have to config more in web.xml or spring.xml?</p>
