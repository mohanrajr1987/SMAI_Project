<p><strong>Problem:</strong> I have a Chrome App that launches in a browser window the utilizes web sockets. The app binds to localhost:9999. All this works fine until I close the app window and reopen. Chrome is still holding onto that port and comes up with an error. </p>  <p><strong>What I want:</strong> I would like to be able to close the web socket/unbind the port when the window is closed so that when reopened it establishes the connection again.</p>  <p>I have tried the <code>chrome.app.window.onClosed</code> in the background.js file to no avail. It doesn't seem to get called when the window is closed. I don't know it this is because I have to some how tell it which window to look out for.</p>  <p>Help appreciated!</p>
