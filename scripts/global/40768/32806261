<p>I new with websockify. So here my situation. Our company have servers written in C# to handle about 1000 to 2000 raw TCP sockets connect per time from Flash and mobile client to play a game online. So we consider to port Flash to Html5 and use Websockify and port native protocol build on TCP at client but still remain native TCP at server side(for mobile client still work).</p>  <p>So I guess Websock client and Websockify server connect via Websock protocol and Websockify and our server connect via TCP protocol</p>  <p>If I right, so can we do that to handle kind of amount connections on Websockify and it performance </p>
