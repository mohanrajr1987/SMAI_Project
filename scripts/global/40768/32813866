<p>I have set up my Rails app on Heroku and used the information in the post: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26131611/heroku-cloudflare-completely-free-ssl">Heroku + Cloudflare completely free SSL</a> to get SSL working for free, but my websockets connection does not work. I get the error <code>WebSocket connection to 'wss://www.myapp.com/websocket' failed: Error during WebSocket handshake: Unexpected response code: 200</code>. I understand that this is due to Cloudflare not supporting websockets in their free plans and they suggest setting up a subdomain that does not pass through Cloudflare. The problem of course is that the subdomain cannot then use the 'free' SSL setup.</p>  <p>Is there anyway I can get this to work, or do I have to shell out for either SSL support on Heroku or Websocket support on Cloudflare?</p>
