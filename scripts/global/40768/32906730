<p>We have a web socket application but we need to distribute it.</p>  <p>However our clients wont take it unless it is digitally signed.</p>  <p>So my question is, how do I sign a WebSocket (So I can use WSS) and do I distribute it out to my clients.</p>  <p>Would I need to sign it for each client, or can I just self sign it?</p>  <p>Or can i just sign it once and distribute that?</p>
