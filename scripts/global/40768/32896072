<p>Imagine: You want to assistant or explain an user of a website (or better web application) while he is using it.</p>  <p>It would be possible to build up a teamviewer connection but then it's neccessary the user has installed the teamviewer client.</p>  <p>Is there any way to implement a remote control of a website? In the best case I see what the user sees and can control the cursor in the website or can move a additional cursor. There have to be a way with JavaScript, AJAX, .., isn't there?</p>  <p>Which components I will have to use to realize this? Node.js? Sockets.IO?</p>
