<p>I'm developing a AngularJS driven SPA. I want to show a fullscreen overlay saying something like "Sorry - Server is not available atm" as soon as the connection between client and server is interrupted. </p>  <p>So I wrote a simple <code>while(true)</code> loop which is basically just calling <code>/api/ping</code> which always returns <code>true</code>. When there is no http response tho, then the message shall appear.</p>  <p>I don't like this approach since it creates a lot of overhead. Especially considering mobile connections.</p>  <p>So what would be a decent solution for my case? I could imagine work with a websocket and an <code>onInterrupted</code> (or similar) event.</p>
