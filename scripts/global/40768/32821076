<p>There is an App build with Grunt. While building, Karma runs some unit-tests for client, using Phantom JS.</p>  <p>There is a new component, working with server via WebSocket. And i need to cover it with some tests. Then working with Ajax, everything is much more clear. There is a description how to do ajax-tests in Jasmine tutorial. But i have no idea there to start with WebSocket testing.</p>  <p>How did you solved this problem? How should i write and run this tests?</p>
