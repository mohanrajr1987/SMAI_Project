<p>I'd like to setup a websocket as a way to push data to clients but I have no interest in anything the client might try to send back on the socket. Since it'll be a publicly available end point, I imagine people will try to send stuff.</p>  <p>My server side implementation is Asp.Net's <code>System.Net.WebSockets</code> being handled in an <code>IHttpHandler</code> (Exactly like <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/617611/Using-WebSocket-in-NET-4-5-Part-1" rel="nofollow">this tutorial</a> up to Step 2).</p>  <p>Can I simply not read from the socket or will data sent to the server pile up somewhere? Do I need to retrieve and just throw away anything that comes in so the pipes stay clear? Better yet, is there a way to define a WebSocket as read only?</p>
