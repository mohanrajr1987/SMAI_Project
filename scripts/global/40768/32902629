<p>In my website, I am currently using the following stack:</p>  <ol> <li>Angularjs </li> <li>Django</li> <li>PostgreSQL</li> </ol>  <p>Now I am facing a challenge where I have several logged in users creating posts, commenting etc like in a typical social network. And I want to maintain a live connection between the server and the client so that a change by one client is propagated to all the other clients.</p>  <p>I began searching for a mechanism to implement this and stumbled upon Meteor. After more research I found <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-ddp" rel="nofollow">Django/PostgreSQL DDP</a> which connects to Meteor via web sockets.</p>  <p>Now, the problem is I don't know how to integrate my current AngularJS codebase (which I cannot rewrite) with Meteor. I ONLY want to use Meteor's web socket DDP feature and the rest of the front end will be AngularJS.</p>  <p>Any suggestions to implement this live connection feature with DDP?</p>
