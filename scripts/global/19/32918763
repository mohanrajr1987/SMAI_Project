<p>I have some entities that were generated from a database and I wanted to serialize them to XML. The problem is that some of the entities have column names that are not so user friendly and this is reflected in the fields of the generated entity.</p>  <p>Is there a C# attribute that I could apply to the class fields so that I could add an xml attribute, that contains a friendly-name value, to the xml element itself? For example, using something similar to the XmlAttribute:</p>  <pre><code>public class Book {     public string Title { get; set; }      [XmlAttribute("friendlyName","International Standard Book Number")]     public string ISBN { get; set; } }  </code></pre>  <p>Should result in something like this when it is serialized:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;Book&gt;   &lt;Title&gt;To Kill a Mockingbird&lt;/Title&gt;   &lt;ISBN friendlyName="International Standard Book Number"&gt;9780061120084&lt;/ISBN&gt; &lt;/Book&gt; </code></pre>
