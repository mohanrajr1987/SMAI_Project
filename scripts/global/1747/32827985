<p>I am trying to assert that the records in my page are equal to the records that my XML file has. I am using C# and NUnit for testing this.</p>  <p>So I am basically trying to add the code:</p>  <pre><code>Assert.AreEqual(libraryPage.Records, 50); </code></pre>  <p>However, instead of the 50, I want the function defined in my XML file so that even if it changes the number gets changed too. How do I do that?</p>
