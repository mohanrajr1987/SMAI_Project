<p>I've a project where I'm reading a excel file for the test cases.The code for reading the excel and mapping the cases to C# classes is being done like this</p>  <pre><code>class AllTests{  public static IEnumerable DemoCases         {             get             {              //Read the excel map the cases here              yield return testcasedataObject;             }         }     } </code></pre>  <p>And the test method looks like this  </p>  <pre><code> [Test, TestCaseSource(typeof(AllTests), "DemoCases")]         public void DemoTest( )         {           //Test execution code         } </code></pre>  <p>Now all this works fine with Nunit 2.6.4, but with the beta the excel is not being read while discovering test cases. I need to use the TestFixtureSource of the beta alongwith the TestCaseSource. </p>
