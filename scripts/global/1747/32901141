<p>I am developing an ASP.NET 5 application targeting dnx451.</p>  <p>Unlike in a "normal" class library project, the test classes are not discovered by the VS2015 Test Explorer after build.</p>  <p>I tried both with NUnit Test Adapter VS Extension (2.0.0.0) installed as well as by adding NUnitTestAdapter NuGet package to the test project.</p>  <p>Am I missing something or is this a general issue with the DNX execution model?</p>
