<p>I use SeleniumWebdriver C# to build automated tests.  I also use NUnit to mark test methods (so I can run them). </p>  <p>In each of the tests there are several verification and when the first verification fails then the test stops executing (an exception is thrown). </p>  <p>I want the test to continue executing so more errors could be found! </p>  <p>Please guys, give me a clue how to do it right.</p>  <p>I think about something like that:</p>  <ol> <li>Instead of throwing Exception in verification I'll add an error to a stack</li> <li>When a test ends I check if my stack is not empty</li> <li>If the stack is not empty I push to console all errors and fail the test</li> <li>If the stack is empty then the test passed successfully. </li> </ol>  <p>Are these steps good? Is there a better way?</p>
