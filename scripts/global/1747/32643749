<p>I have to do a simple unit test to check if <code>UpdateScript</code> is being called when <code>DateTimeChanged</code> is called. I would like to use mock for <code>UpdateScript</code> because it is a complex legacy code. </p>  <p>I tried using the Mocks and Stubs, but that is not working. Is there a way to mock just the sub method?</p>  <pre><code>public void DateTimeChanged() {     if (isToggleOn)     {         this.UpdateScript();     } } </code></pre>
