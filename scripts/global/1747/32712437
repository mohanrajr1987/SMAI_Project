<p>In my test the next flow takes place:</p>  <ol> <li>I do some actions (for example buy a product) before all tests are run</li> <li>Then in each test I check one assertion </li> </ol>  <p>I use NUnit framework to run test so I use [TestFixtureSetUp] to mark a set of actions that are done once before all tests. Then I use [Test] or [TestCase()] to run tests. </p>  <p>Often it happens that I need to check the same things but perform different flow. So I have to parameterize [TestFixtureSetUp]. Can I somehow do it?</p>  <p><strong>So I want to make my set of actions that is performed once before all tests depended on parameters.</strong></p>  <p>If it's possible to do with different frameworks or different flow structure please tell me)</p>  <p><strong>Example of my code:</strong></p>  <pre><code> [TestFixtureSetUp] //This will be done once before all tests  public void Buy_Regular_One_Draw_Ticket(WayToPay merchant)  {           //here I want to do some actions and use different merchants to pay.             //So how can I send different parameters to this method?   } </code></pre>
