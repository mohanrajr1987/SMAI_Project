<p>I've got an odd question for which Google has proven barren:</p>  <p>I've got a project in .net with ~20 classes that all have tests in them. One of the classes has common test setup code, although a few of the classes have their own TestFixtureSetup that looks exactly like the common class (not my architecture choice - this predates my employment). I have my own test class for which I have some different code that runs prior to running a few particular tests within the class.</p>  <p>Some more info that's relevant: The custom setup code that I have enables data to be available for a few combinatorial tests I have in my own test class. As the value source for the combinatorial params, the List that is returned first initializes some data.</p>  <p>Alright, here's the question: When I try to run a test in ANOTHER test class, it's "building" the tests from every other class. In my case, it's building the combinatorial test that I have - and thus, triggering the custom setup method that I have.</p>  <p>How do I prevent NUnit from building tests in other classes? As in, I run a test in one class, all I'd like NUnit to do is build tests from that class ONLY.</p>  <p>I tried to remove any NDA-no-no language, but here's the combinatorial I have:</p>  <pre><code>[Test, Combinatorial, Category("Regressive")]         public void Test05_CombiTestExample(             [ValueSource("ListA")] User user,             [ValueSource("ListB")] KeyValuePair&lt;string, string&gt; searchKvp,             [ValueSource("ListC")] string scope)         { </code></pre>  <p>And here's one of the lists that is being reference:</p>  <pre><code>public IEnumerable&lt;KeyValuePair&lt;string, string&gt;&gt; ListB         {             get             {                 InitCustomData();                 if ([Redacted] != null)                 {                     return new Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt;()                         {                             [Redacted]                         };                 }                 return null;             }         } </code></pre>  <p>The line in question is "InitCustomData();" which, because my combinatorial is being built prior to running any setup or anything, is being executed anyway. I want this to stay here - I just don't want NUnit to start building test cases from any other class besides the one it's currently running a test in.</p>
