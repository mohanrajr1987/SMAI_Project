<p><strong>Background</strong></p>  <p>I have 2 solutions with similar structures. I have 2 projects in each solution, one is the actual code <em>(NUnitSample1)</em> while the other is the test project (<em>NUnitSample1.Test</em>) with the unit tests. <em>NUnitSample1.Test</em> contains a reference of the first project <em>NUnitSample1</em>. The Build Output path for both projects are different and are explicitly specified. The CopyLocal property of the <em>NUnitSample1</em> project reference is set to false (this is required and cannot be changed).</p>  <p>When I try to run NUnit test cases using Resharper, I get the following error message: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>System.IO.FileNotFoundException : Could not load file or assembly   'NUnitSample1, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null'   or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.</p> </blockquote>  <p>This is because the assemblies are in different locations. I can solve this problem by hooking up the <code>AssemblyResolve</code> event in my test <code>SetUp</code> method and loading the missing assembly at runtime.</p>  <p><strong>Issue</strong></p>  <p>When I run the test in the first solution (without the <code>AssemblyResolve</code> event hooked up), the unit test fails and I get the error message as the unit test result. The breakpoints in <code>SetUp</code> method are hit, and if I now hook up the <code>AssemblyResolve</code> event, things work fine.</p>  <p>When I run the test in the second solution, I get the error message in a dialog:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><strong>Unit Test Runner failed to run tests.</strong></p>      <p>System.IO.FileNotFoundException : Could not load file or assembly   'NUnitSample1, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null'   or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.</p> </blockquote>  <p>The problem is, the <code>SetUp</code> method is never invoked, and therefore, my <code>AssemblyResolve</code> event is never hooked up or the assembly reference error resolved. The test result is <code>Inconclusive: Test wasn't run</code>. </p>  <p>I'm not sure why this is happening in the second case. I don't know when and where the assembly reference is trying to be resolved, and the dialog shown. I need the <code>SetUp</code> method to be invoked and the test to be run, irrespective of whether the assembly reference is resolved, similar to how it works in the first solution. TIA.</p>  <p>Versions:</p>  <p>Resharper: 8.0.1</p>  <p>NUnit: 2.6.2</p>
