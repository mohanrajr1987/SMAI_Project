<p>I am doing a demo, and want Nunit better integrated in Visual Studio.</p>  <ol> <li>Menu options to Create NUnit test project and test class with reference to the framework (Like Microsoft Test does)</li> <li>Run/Debug "selected tests" and individual tests with debugging.  I don't get it to work with [TestCase]-attribute, seems to run all testcases for a test.</li> <li>Run failed tests with debugging.</li> <li>Other cool stuff.</li> </ol>  <p>(Visual Studio 2015 RC) I see some plugins in the gallery, but I am not sure if they do 1-3, and if they work.</p>
