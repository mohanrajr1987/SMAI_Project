<p>I am currently trying to setup Unit to unittest our ReactiveUI ViewModels using NUnit and Moq. However I can't get it working. I can't add ReactiveUI to a NUnit test library (Unable to resolve dependency 'Rx-Xaml (â‰¥ 2.2.5)'), and I can't add Moq to a PCL project.</p>  <p>Is it even possible to unittest ReactiveUI ViewModels with NUnit and Moq?</p>  <p>Btw: I'm using Xamarin Studio on Mac OSX 10.10.5 but the code runs fine on Windows 10 :(</p>  <p>On OSX I get a Unix Transport Error, but on Windows the test does work.</p>
