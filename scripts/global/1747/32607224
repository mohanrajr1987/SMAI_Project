<p>When using <a href="https://github.com/nunit/nunit/wiki/Console-Runner" rel="nofollow"><code>nunit-console.exe</code></a> to run tests from the command line you can have a <code>result.xml</code>file created, which can further be used for example by <a href="http://relevantcodes.com/reportunit-report-generator/" rel="nofollow">ReportUnit</a> to create nice looking reports.</p>  <h1>Question</h1>  <p>Is there a way to produce this result.xml file when running the tests not via nunit-console but with the <a href="http://nunit.org/index.php?p=vsTestAdapter&amp;r=3.0" rel="nofollow">NUnit (3.0) Test Adapter for Visual Studio</a> via the Test Explorer Window?</p>  <p>At least I wasn't able to find an xml file after the tests finished running, so I assume, that there is none created.</p>  <p>* I'm using Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2015</p>
