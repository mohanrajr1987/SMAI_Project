<p>I'm using NUnit 3.0 and TestFixtureSource to run test cases inside a fixture multiple times with different parameters/configurations (I do want to do this at TestFixture level). Simple example:</p>  <pre><code>[TestFixtureSource(typeof (ConfigurationProvider))] public class Fixture {     public Fixture(Configuration configuration)     {         _configuration = configuration;     }      private Configuration _configuration;      [Test]     public void Test()     {         //do something with _configuration         Assert.Fail();     } } </code></pre>  <p>Let's say Test() fails for one of the configurations and succeeds for another. In the run report file and in Visual Studio's Test Explorer the name for both the failed and the succeeded runs will be displayed as just Test(), which doesn't tell me anything about which setup caused issues. </p>  <p><strong>Is there a way to affect the test cases names in this situation (i.e. prefix its name per fixture run/configuration)?</strong> As a workaround I'm currently printing to the results output before each test case fires but I would rather avoid doing that. </p>  <p>Since NUnit 3.0 is in beta and this feature is fairly new I wasn't able to find anything in the docs. I found TestCaseData but I don't think it's tailored to be used with fixtures just yet (it's designed for test cases).</p>
