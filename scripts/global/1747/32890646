<p>I have in my NANT build script:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;nunit2 verbose="true"&gt;     &lt;formatter type="Plain" /&gt;     &lt;test assemblyname="..\MyProject\bin\Release\MyProject.Test.dll"/&gt; &lt;/nunit2&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I am getting a "BadImageException" for almost all of my tests because one of the references of MyProject.Test is an x64 DLL. Here's what I tried:</p>  <ol> <li>running the same MyProject.Test.dll using <code>nunit-console.exe</code> runs all tests fine and they all pass</li> <li>running the same MyProject.Test.dll using <code>nunit-console-x86.exe</code> gives the same error as NANT</li> </ol>  <p>So it looks to me that I just have to force NANT to run the same way as <code>nunit-console.exe</code>. The thing is that I can't figure out how to do that. How can I force the <code>&lt;nunit2&gt;</code> task to run the MyProject.Test.dll in x64 mode?</p>
