<p>I am using some COM library in my C# which is bound to particular hardware and doesn't work without it. On development/testing computer I don't have that hardware. The method which is using library looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>using HWSysManagerLib; bool ProcessBias(HWSysManager systemManager, string hwPath) {     int handle = systemManager.OpenConfiguration(hwPath);     ...     // some magic goes here     // return result } </code></pre>  <p>The question is, can I mock <code>HWSysManager</code> for test method and how? There are few methods only in <code>HWSysManager</code> and it wouldn't be problem to simulate their functionality for test. A tiny example would be great on how to mock it, if it's possible at all.</p>
