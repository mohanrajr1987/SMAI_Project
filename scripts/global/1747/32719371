<p>I am trying to run the firefox only test using the command line for NUnit but not sure how to. The code is as follow.</p>  <pre><code>[TestFixture(typeof(FirefoxDriver))] [TestFixture(typeof(ChromeDriver))] [TestFixture(typeof(InternetExplorerDriver))] public class TestCases&lt;TWebDriver&gt; where TWebDriver : IWebDriver, new() {} </code></pre>  <p>No problem with NUnit GUI since it is separated, however requirements forces us to run it with the command line. Thanks.</p>  <p>I'm looking into like: nunit.console.exe /fixture:"value" /xml:.. etc.. or any other implementation</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
