<p>I deleted all my supporting files form Xcode's project and still when I run the app some how some images are still there/appearing but when i search in the search box for the file at the bottom left of the project. It says that there no file of that name in my project does anyone know why or how this is happening? And theres nothing in assets I'm using Swift if it helps Thanks</p>
