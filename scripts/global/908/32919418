<p>I am writing a Core Bluetooth App for IOS.  It is connecting to a TI device With custom firmware.  The firmware developer developed it to publish data 12 times a second.  I am using the Notify Property to get the data, but it seems that we are grabbing the data 30 times per second.  This is causing extra power consumption, and for specific reasons, I can't pull at my own rate I need to pull at the rate of the device is publishing.  </p>  <p>The firmware developer created a Windows Application that doesn't have this problem without having a hard coded Read Rate.  So it is On me to find the issue.<br> Does anyone have any recommendations?</p>
