<p>I've got an issue using OCMock in an Xcode project of mine.</p>  <p>I've got an Xcode project (Xcode 6.4 6E35b, on Yosemite 10.10.5) which contains my application target and related XCTest target. This is an OSX project, not an iOS project. All code is Objective C; no Swift. I already have several vanilla XCTests which are working perfectly. As per the <a href="http://ocmock.org/" rel="nofollow">OCMock installation instructions for OSX projects</a>, I have copied the framework to my project directory and set my test target to link against it via the test target > build phases > Link Binary With Libraries menu.</p>  <p>Attempting to run the tests after doing this fails with the error: "IDEBundleInjection.c: Error 3587 loading bundle &lt;path to derived data directory of my test target>: The bundle &lt;name of my test target> couldn't be loaded because it is damaged or missing necessary resources.", followed by a printout of what appear to be various environment variables used to locate linked frameworks. What am I doing wrong here? Please note that the test target successfully builds; the error occurs when it tries to run.</p>
