<p>Bid code is by default enabled on XCode project settings.  I am dependent on few third party libraries where I get compilation error as the SDK is does not support BitCode? If I disable the error is gone. But I do not know the after effects of this change?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/mF125.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/mF125.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
