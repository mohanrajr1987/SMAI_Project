<p>I can't see the timeline slider in my Xcode 7 playground. I created a new default "hello world" project, following the instruction in the "About Playgrounds" help topic, and neither the "Timeline slider" nor the "Time field" window appears at the bottom of the playground.</p>  <p>I've tried the various view options under the View menu and searched the help and www, no obvious answers.</p>
