<p>I just realized a small problem in memory allocation, and releasing unnecessary instances.</p>  <p>So I have a view controller with two dispatch queues.</p>  <pre><code>static dispatch_queue_t _queue_1; static dispatch_queue_t _queue_2;  @interface ... @end </code></pre>  <p>!! The view controller never gets deallocated.</p>  <p>However if they are not static, and part of that view controller class, <code>dealloc</code> gets called.</p>  <pre><code>dispatch_queue_t _queue_1; dispatch_queue_t _queue_2; </code></pre>  <p>This bugs me because I didn't think static variables would bump up it's retain count? I mean - it exists throughout the app-life-cycle as a static variable. But why is this tied up with that VC class? Why is the VC not getting deallocated in the first test?</p>
