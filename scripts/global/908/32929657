<p>Can someone help me make an iOS 9 supported switch like the following? I've tried styling it but I can't get the default background changed or the sizing. Thank you so much for any help provided. I don't have to be spoon fed, just guided.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/oCHzp.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/oCHzp.png" alt="Custom On Switch"></a></p>
