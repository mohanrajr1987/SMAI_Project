<p>I am trying to use the Twilio API for my Swift project, but I encounter an error when I reach step 4 shown below.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/0uC1o.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/0uC1o.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>If I try to add "-ObjC", I am getting the “linker command failed with exit code 1” error. </p>  <p>libTwilioClient.a(TCConnection.o)' does not contain bitcode. You must rebuild it with bitcode enabled (Xcode setting ENABLE_BITCODE), obtain an updated library from the vendor, or disable bitcode for this target. for architecture arm64 clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)</p>  <p>What is causing this issue?</p>
