<p>In my project, I have ViewController A for login, when I pressed the login button it show ViewController B where I have four buttons. When I click button1, I have showSegue direct to TabBarController and it has two tabs. Same as button 2,3,4 I have showSegue directs to NavigationController. Actually this is the hierarchy of my TabBarController and NavigationController:</p>  <p>Click Button 1 to:</p>  <pre><code>TabBarController -&gt;  Tab1 -&gt; NavigationController -&gt; ViewController1 Tab2 -&gt; NavigationController -&gt; ViewController2 </code></pre>  <p>Click Button 2,3,4 to:</p>  <pre><code>NavigationController -&gt; ViewController </code></pre>  <p>I used storyboard in this project running Swift 2, Xcode 7. When I click each buttons, it takes almost 1-2 seconds delays especially on iPad real device. A bad user experience. It takes me a time to search some answers but sadly i didn't found a solution, that's why I asked it here..</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
