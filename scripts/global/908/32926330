<p>I'm confused on how apple determines the IOS version your app needs to run on. For example, for my recent app, I made everything with spritekit in objective c so I assumed it should required IOS 7.0 but when it was submitted it required IOS 8.4.</p>  <p>I think it may be because I added: Google analytics, Flurry analytics, and Parse into my app. </p>  <p>Do you think because of these frameworks I added in that it caused my app to have a higher required IOS version?</p>  <p>If this was the case, how to you avoid increasing the required version while still adding in these frameworks?</p>  <p>Any advice would be appreciated.</p>
