<p>Created a new project in <code>Xcode 7</code>. With default settings, it created a single storyboard with <code>use size classes</code> selected. I disabled <code>use size classes</code> option in storyboard because my project still needs to support <code>iOS 7.0</code></p>  <p>I created a separate storyboard for iPad and tried to connect that in project settings. <strong>But, can't see options for selecting iPad storyboard</strong>.</p>  <p>Here it is a screenshot of settings in my project.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/4VOIB.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/4VOIB.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>In above screenshot, it shows that I selected device as 'Universal'. Still I can select only one storyboard. For iPad, I don't have an option to select separate storyboard.</p>  <p>Any advice would be appreciated.</p>
