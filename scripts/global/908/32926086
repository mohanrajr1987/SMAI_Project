<p>Simple question that I'm currently having trouble as to how to get started.</p>  <p>I have a ViewController with multiple images/icons, and I would like to have new view controllers for each image/icon that is selected. I have a segue (show) from my initial view controller to my new one...but now how do I code it so when I click on a specific image it'll segue to the corresponding VC I want?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
