<p>I upgraded, downgraded, and finally settled on Xcode 6.4 for my React Native development. However, now I'm unable to use <code>git</code>.</p>  <pre><code>henry at Henrys-MacBook-Air in ~/code $ git  xcodebuild: error: SDK "/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator9.0.sdk" cannot be located. git: error: unable to find utility "git", not a developer tool or in PATH </code></pre>  <p>I've tried agreeing to the Xcode agreement with <code>sudo xcodebuild -license</code> with no luck. I am on Mac OS X Yosemite.</p>
