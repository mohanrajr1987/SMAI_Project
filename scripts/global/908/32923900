<p>I am trying to add the App Transport Security keys to my Info.plist as described in the following Apple tech note <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/technotes/App-Transport-Security-Technote/#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40016240-CH1-SW3" rel="nofollow">https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/technotes/App-Transport-Security-Technote/#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40016240-CH1-SW3</a> (Exclusions section)</p>  <p>When I edit the Info.plist file, I did the following:</p>  <ol> <li>Click on the '+' next to 'Information Property List' to create a new top level key</li> <li>Clicked the dropdown to select "NSAppTransportSecurity'</li> </ol>  <p>However Xcode doesn't list the option in the drop down list (screenshot below). </p>  <p>Do I need to open the Info.plist file in a text editor and edit this manually?! Or am I missing some (probably obvious!) step?</p>  <p>I'm using Xcode 7.0.1</p>  <p>Thanks</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/U4qRK.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/U4qRK.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
