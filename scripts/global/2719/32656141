<p>I've got a windows dll that throws <code>std::system_error</code>s with category <code>std::system_category()</code>.</p>  <p>If they get caught inside the dll, no problem I can compare them with a <code>std::error_condition'</code>. But, if I catch in my exe that links to the dll, then comparisons always fail because the <code>std::system_category()</code> in that context does not == the one in the caught exception.</p>  <p>I'm struggling to understand if this should work and there's a bug, or if this shouldn't be supported?</p>  <p>Both the dll and exe link to the same dll version of the CRT.</p>  <p>Also, if the dll and exe linked to static versions of the CRT, I guess this wouldn't be expected to work?</p>  <p>I read <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/error/system_category" rel="nofollow">this description of std::system_category</a>, (emphasis mine):</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Obtains a reference to the <strong>static</strong> error category object for errors   reported by the operating system.</p> </blockquote>
