<p>I am trying to convert a VRML file (<em>.wrl</em>) to binary STL (<em>stl</em>) or ply (<em>.ply</em>) file with MeshLab to finally display it with <strong>three.js</strong>. </p>  <p>There is already a <strong>VRML Loader</strong> in three.js but I want to test the performance between the different file formats. The problem is that whenever I import a VRML file on MeshLab, it loses some color. In the end, the export too.</p>  <p>I want to keep the colors of the mesh defined in the VRML file and export it in either stl or ply.</p>  <p>I've tried to convert the vrml files via meshconv too but unfortunately, it also doesn't propagate the colors.</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong> : Loading a simple X3D (<em>.x3d</em>) file with one color is also displayed in shades of gray in MeshLab</p>
