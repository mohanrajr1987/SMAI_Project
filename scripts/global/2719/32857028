<p>In my current task , I need to read the read the approximately 10,000 records (student data) from database and need to store the same in container. Now I need to select container to store all this records in order to generate the report. Report generation option Is vendor specific as one vendor wants to dump the all the records without sorting and other vendor wants to generate the report based on sorted name field. I have selected vector from my end as i don't require any kind of insertion in the middle and no searching effort is required for first option (report without sorting the fields) but for second option can anybody suggest me if vector would be suitable option for the same by introducing sorting based on name field.</p>  <p>below is the some useful pointers which I found  in scott meyers book (Effective STL) in item 23 . I believe based on below information for second option sorted vector needs to be used but still I want somebody to through some light on this before I come to any conclusion and start coding. </p>  <p>Item 23. Consider replacing associative containers with sorted vectors</p>  <p>"**The standard associative containers are typically implemented as balanced binary search trees. A balanced binary search tree is a data structure that is optimized for a mixed combination of insertions, erasures, and lookups. That is, it's designed for applications that do some insertions, then some lookups, then maybe some more inser-tions, then perhaps some erasures, then a few more lookups, then more insertions or erasures, then more lookups, etc. The key characteristic of this sequence of events is that the insertions, erasures, and lookups are all mixed up. In general, there's no way to predict what the next operation on the tree will be"</p>
