<p>The user who asked the following question accepted "read buffer" pretty fast: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14080153/what-does-rd-stand-for-in-rdstate-and-rdbuf">What does rd stand for in rdstate and rdbuf?</a></p>  <p>I still wonder what "read buffer" would mean in the context of "std::ostream" (cout). I did not find ANY STL documentation describing this function as doing any "reading". Is that just a misnamed function? (...apparently, but maybe I am missing something)</p>
