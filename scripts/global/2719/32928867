<p>I have an <code>std::vector&lt;unsigned int&gt; v</code> with some Ã­ndices (for performance purposes I can't use <code>std::set</code>.</p>  <p>I want to create the negated version of <code>v</code>, i.e., the vector with all the remaining indices. If, in a range <code>[0,10]</code>, <code>v=[0,2,4,6,8]</code>, I want the negated version, <code>nv=[1,3,5,7,9]</code>.</p>  <p>Note: <code>v</code> is sorted!</p>  <p>What is the most effective way of doing so?</p>
