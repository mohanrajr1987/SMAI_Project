<p>I am trying to load an <strong>stl</strong> file by just modifying the url of the function <code>load</code> of the <code>loader</code> in this example : <a href="http://threejs.org/examples/webgl_loader_stl.html" rel="nofollow">http://threejs.org/examples/webgl_loader_stl.html</a> </p>  <p>But I don't know why, it loads and after a certain time the rotation of the scene begins but I can't visualize anything... I tried to put the mesh informations in the console and the mesh does exist, has a geometry, etc. </p>  <p>The STL in itself is quite big (28.2 MB) and comes from CATIA V5.</p>  <p>And loading it in this free online viewer using three.js works : <a href="http://www.viewstl.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.viewstl.com/</a></p>  <p>But it doesn't use the <code>STLLoader.js</code> the example uses.</p>
