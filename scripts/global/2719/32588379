<p>I have an abstract class in my project, its derivatives is used for input/output to different locations.  It has virtual methods <em>read</em> and <em>write</em>.</p>  <pre><code>virtual unsigned read(void *buf, unsigned len) = 0; virtual void write(const void *buf, unsigned len) = 0; </code></pre>  <p>I need a kind of an <strong>adapter</strong> between std streams (std::istream and std::ostream) and this class to redirect input/output to these methods.</p>  <p>So, for example, if</p>  <pre><code>mystream &lt;&lt; "some output"; </code></pre>  <p>is called, it will call the <em>write</em> method.</p>  <p>I guess i should overload <em>std::istream</em> and <em>std::ostream</em> or <em>std::streambuf</em>, but not sure  which methods.</p>  <p>What is the better way to implement this?</p>
