<p>I have a dicom file, which when I try to open up in imagej I get the error "cannot open compressed dicom". Now I used dcmdjpeg to uncompress it and then I could open it in imagej. My problem is that the uncompressed dicom from dcmdjpeg I get is 3D dsa image, and I am not able to segment it (in vmtk) and get the surface stl file.  Is there a way to get the surface stl file?  Thanks in advance! </p>
