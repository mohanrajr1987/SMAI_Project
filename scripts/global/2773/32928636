<p>I am trying to check values to see if they fall into the interval below</p>  <pre><code>   if((First$Height&gt;=10 &amp; First$Height&lt;=50)==TRUE) {       cat("No errors \n")    } else {       cat("Error \n")    } </code></pre>  <p>But when I run this first line, i get:</p>  <pre><code>the condition has length &gt; 1 and only the first element will be used </code></pre>  <p>I have tried many different combinations of the above statement and every time I get this error. I also tried using &amp;&amp;. While I didn't get an error, it did not give me the correct output I am looking for. I am wondering why I keep getting this error for my statement, I cannot figure it out. Is there a way for me to adjust my statement so that I won't get the error?</p>
