<p>I am trying to convert a string in a float within an <code>if</code> statement. Now I can call it on the actual <code>if</code> line but not inside of it:</p>  <pre><code>rates = "1" if float(rates) == 1:    #This works     print "Hi" if rates == "1":     float(rates) += 1    #This doesn't work </code></pre>  <p>Now the error is that the function (<code>float()</code>) could not be called from within the <code>if</code> statement for the second <code>if</code> statement. Why is this happening? Here is the error:</p>  <pre><code>C:\Python27\python.exe C:/Users/Anthony/Desktop/Python/PyQt/Pratical_Programs/Stack_Overflow.py   File "C:/Users/Anthony/Desktop/Python/PyQt/Pratical_Programs/Stack_Overflow.py", line 5     float(rates) += 1    #This doesn't work SyntaxError: can't assign to function call </code></pre>
