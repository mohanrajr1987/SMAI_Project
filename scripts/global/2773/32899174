<p>I want to unwrap these 6 optional variables, and if they are null i want to give them a blank String value. This is so I can send these variables packaged into a parameters array that's sent to an API. </p>  <p>I'm still a beginner at Swift, and this is the only easiest way I have understood how to implement this, but the inner coder in me is saying this looks redundant and crappy as ****. </p>  <p>Can someone help me condense this or make it simpler?</p>  <pre><code>    if let fbEmail = self.fbEmail {      }else{         self.fbEmail = ""     }      if let fbDob = self.fbDob {      }else{         self.fbDob = ""     }      if let fbGender = self.fbGender {      }else{         self.fbGender = ""     }     if let fbUserIp = self.fbUserIp {      }else{         self.fbUserIp = ""     }     if let fbFacebookId = self.fbFacebookId {      }else{         self.fbFacebookId = ""     }     if let fbFacebookAccessToken = self.fbFacebookAccessToken {      }else{         self.fbFacebookAccessToken = ""     } </code></pre>
