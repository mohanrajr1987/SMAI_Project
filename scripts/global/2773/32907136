<p>I'm attempting to create a postcode search that includes an error message if an invalid postcode is entered. </p>  <p>I have identified the postcodes that are to be valid in an array and declared a statement that if the input value includes any of these values the error message will not display. However as I have declared only the first letters of the postcode, when a complete postcode is entered that includes additional characters as well as a value from the array, the error message is displayed.</p>  <p>How can I make it so that if the first letters of the input value equal an array value along with additional characters the message remains off?</p>  <p>Is the statement <code>if(include())</code> not the way to go?</p>  <p><a href="https://jsfiddle.net/garyvoss/xbxygguz/4/" rel="nofollow">JSFiddle of what I have so far</a></p>
