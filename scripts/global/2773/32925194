<p>No matter what's the value of <em>what</em>, the true part of if condition is always executed.</p>  <pre><code>what = "" def sendPacket(where, what):         print("sendPacket()&gt; i/p what :" + what)         if what:             zb.send('tx',dest_addr_long = where,dest_addr = UNKNOWN,data = what)             print('sendPacket()&gt; Data: '+ what)              print('sendPacket()&gt; Data sent to: '+ where )         else:             print('sendPacket()&gt; data not sent') </code></pre>  <p>I want the true part to be executed only when <em>what</em> is not equal to null or empty. Any help would be appreciated.</p>
