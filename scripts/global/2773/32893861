<p>Last question was answered so quickly &amp; accurately, I figured I'd give it another go!</p>  <p>So in Column A, there's a list of Magazine names.  In Column C there's a list of Advertiser's names.  Magazine titles &amp; Advertiser names may repeat like so...</p>  <p>Time Magazine (Column A) ........ Amazon (Column C)<br> Time Magazine (Column A) ........ Amazon (Column C)<br> Forbes (Column A) ........ Google (Column C)<br> Forbes (Column A) ........ Amazon (Column C)<br></p>  <p>On a separate sheet in cell A1 I have a Data Validation drop down with the names of Advertiser's from Column C mentioned before.</p>  <p>I'm looking to input a formula which will lookup the Advertiser's name selected by the data validation drop down &amp; tell me YES or NO to whether their name is ever associated with a specific magazine title in Column A, such as Forbes.</p>  <p>So in the example above, I'd want to be able to select the Advertiser "Google" from my data validation drop down &amp; see a YES, indicating to me they do advertise in Forbes.</p>  <p>Hopefully this makes sense!</p>
