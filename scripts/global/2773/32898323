<p>I am currently writing a static function where an open file object is passed in as a parameter. It then reads the file, and if the line is empty, it returns False. If the line is not empty, it uses the line in question plus the next three to create a new object of Person class (the class being designed in my module). For some reason, my if statement is not catching newlines, no matter what method I have tried, and I keep getting errors because of it. What am I doing wrong?</p>  <pre><code>@staticmethod def read_person(fobj):     p_list = []     for line in fobj:         if line.isspace() or line == "\n":             return False         else:             p_list.append(line)     return Person(p_list[0],p_list[1],p_list[2],p_list[3]) </code></pre>  <p>Thanks for your help!</p>
