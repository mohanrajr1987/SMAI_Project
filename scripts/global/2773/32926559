<p>My if statement won't work, i am a beginner and yes i've looked at least 5 examples if you're wondering and i still can't get it right. I feel like it's correct yet it still won't do what i want it to do.</p>  <p>There is more code if you're wondering but it shouldn't do anything to this</p>  <pre><code>  Start = 0     Start = input("--&gt;: ")     if Start == 3:         print ("successful") </code></pre>
