<p>My code asks for input twice. I know that's because of the two <code>scanf()</code> calls, but I don't know how I could get rid of one of the calls in order to make it only ask for input once. I need to check to make sure the input is a number and if it is a number then make sure it's between 0 and 90.</p>  <pre><code>printf("Hello! Let's compute the escape velocity of a baseball!\n"); printf("Please supply the angle of travel, in degrees: "); scanf(" %lf", &amp;angleTravel);     if (scanf(" %lf", &amp;angleTravel) != 1){         printf("Please enter a number.");         return(0);}     if ((angleTravel &gt; 90) || (angleTravel &lt; 0)){          printf("Please try again with an angle between 0 and 90.\n");         return(0);} radianTravel = angleTravel * (M_PI / 180.0);  printf("The angle you supplied is %lf degrees, or %lf radians\n",       angleTravel, radianTravel); </code></pre>
