<p>I am learning how to program so please be nice. :)</p>  <p>I have this error running the code: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>An unhandled exception of type 'System.FormatException' occurred in   mscorlib.dll Additional information: Input string was not in a correct   format.</p> </blockquote>  <p>When I type "screw you, don't tell me what to do!". When I delete the whole insult part of the code, it's working flawlessly. What am I doing wrong?</p>  <pre><code>namespace ConsoleApplication6  {     class Program     {         static void Main(string[] args)         {             int numero1 = 5; //Declaring first variable             int numero2 = 5; //Declaring second variable              Console.WriteLine ("What is the answer of " + numero1 + " x " + numero2); //Asking question to the user              int answer = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine()); //Converting the "answer" to integral variable             string insult = Console.ReadLine(); //The user enter his insult                        if (answer == 25) //If the answer is 25             {                 Console.WriteLine("Good answer!"); //This message appears                         }             else if (insult == "screw you, don't tell me what to do!") //If the user insult me             {                 Console.WriteLine("Wow buddy, gotta check that language!"); //The user receives this message                           }             else             {                 Console.WriteLine("Dude...what?"); //If the user write anything else, he gets this message             }             Console.ReadKey();         }     }  } </code></pre>
