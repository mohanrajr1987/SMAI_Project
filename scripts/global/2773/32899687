<p>I fixed the issues you guys pointed out (thanks btw!) but now it's giving me an infinite loop. I don't see why. My mortgageleft is getting decreased by the monthlypayment every time the while loop runs...</p>  <pre><code>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;   int main(){     float MortgageLeft, InterestRate, MonthlyPayment, MonIntRate, AmountOwed;     int Month=0;      printf("What is the value left on the mortgage?\n");     scanf("%f", &amp;MortgageLeft);      printf("What is the annual interest rate of the loan, in percent?\n");     scanf("%f", &amp;InterestRate);      printf("What is the monthly payment?\n\n");     scanf("%f", &amp;MonthlyPayment);      MonIntRate= (InterestRate/12)/100;      printf("Month\t\t Payment\t\t Amount Owed");      while (MortgageLeft&gt;0){         MortgageLeft=(MortgageLeft*MonIntRate)+MortgageLeft;         if(MortgageLeft&gt;MonthlyPayment)         {             MortgageLeft=MortgageLeft-MonthlyPayment;                 Month++;             printf("%d\t\t %.2f\t\t %.2f", Month, MonthlyPayment, MortgageLeft);         }  }     return 0; } </code></pre>
