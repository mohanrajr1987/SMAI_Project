<p>I was installing libtool 2.4.6 and ran into the following problem:</p>  <pre><code>libtool: Version mismatch error.  This is libtool 2.4.6, revision 2.4.6, libtool: but the definition of this LT_INIT comes from revision . libtool: You should recreate aclocal.m4 with macros from revision 2.4.6 libtool: of libtool 2.4.6 and run autoconf again. Makefile:1261: recipe for target 'libltdl/loaders/libltdl_libltdl_la-preopen.lo' failed </code></pre>  <p>In an effort to fix this issue and after looking around on google, I executed the following command to recreate aclocal.m4. however, I got "cannot list files" error:</p>  <pre><code>[server]#  autoreconf --install libtoolize:   error: cannot list files: '/var/tmp/work/libtool-2.4.6.i386/share/libtool/build-aux' autoreconf: libtoolize failed with exit status: 1 </code></pre>  <p>the directory was there and can be listed with ls command:</p>  <pre><code>[server]#  ls -l /var/tmp/work/libtool-2.4.6.i386/share/libtool/build-aux total 0 </code></pre>  <p>Any idea?</p>
