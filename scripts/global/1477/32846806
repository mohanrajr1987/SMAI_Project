<p>I am trying to install a python package by using <code>python setup.py install</code> but at some point of the installation procedure an error is raised:</p>  <pre><code>gcc: error: x86_64: No such file or directory gcc: error: unrecognized option ‘-arch’ error: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1 </code></pre>  <p>Previously, I installed Xcode 7.0 and their respective Command Line Tools for Xcode 7. The compiler seems to be in <code>which gcc</code> local <code>/usr/local/bin/gcc</code>. However, when I tried <code>gcc -v</code> I got <code>Segmentation fault: 11</code>. Moreover, when I tried <code>/usr/bin/gcc -v</code> I got</p>  <pre><code>Configured with: --prefix=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr --with-gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/c++/4.2.1 Apple LLVM version 7.0.0 (clang-700.0.72) Target: x86_64-apple-darwin14.5.0 Thread model: posix </code></pre>  <p>Then, the installed compiler seems to be in a different location. A similar issue was raised in <a href="http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/182083/command-line-tool-installed-but-gcc-g-compiler-not-working?newreg=d874000f6aa847b8869f8775187c6684">Command line tool installed, but gcc/g++ compiler not working</a> but there is not a clear solution to the problem. Do you have any idea how can I can fix it (link to the actual installed compiler to continue the installation of the Python package)? Thanks in advance. </p>
