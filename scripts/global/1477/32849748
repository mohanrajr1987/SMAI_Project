<p>I am using a Makefile to compile my cpp files and header files. But what I don't fully understand is the difference between -o and -c while compiling.  I know -o creates an object file and normally we write    "g++ -o compile demo.cpp"  to compile a program demo.cpp. But when compiling a program that has many classes, why are we using     "g++ -c class.cpp" and not -o like we normally do. Here's a sample Makefile. Thanks a lot for helping me out!</p>  <pre><code>all:compile  compile: demo.cpp class.o     g++ -o compile demo.cpp class.o class.o: class.h class.cpp     g++ -c class.cpp </code></pre>
