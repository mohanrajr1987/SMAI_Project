<p>I'm trying to package <code>Kaldi</code> for <code>openSUSE</code> and I have this issue. To be policies convenient, I have to define a so version for the shared library, as upstream doesn't. The problem is, when gcc is building the libraries after building the first one, which is basically dependency of all of them, it can't find the first built library (<code>libkaldi-base.so.0</code>) :</p>  <pre><code>i586-suse-linux/bin/ld: cannot find -lkaldi-base </code></pre>  <p><a href="http://paste.opensuse.org/58692727" rel="nofollow">My patch</a>.</p>  <p><a href="http://paste.opensuse.org/60496116" rel="nofollow">This</a> is the original file containing the build rules.</p>
