<p>I want to create an owner draw menu bar (by menu bar I mean a bar that has the same width as the application window, not just to fit the menus) like the one in the image below</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/aIXxq.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/aIXxq.png" alt="Notice the menu item on the right and the background color for the bar that takes the full width of the window"></a></p>  <p>(Notice the menu item on the right and the background color for the bar that takes the full width of the window)</p>  <p>I only want the <em>buttons</em> to be customized (the size and the rectangle with a border on hover, and another effect when they're active), the menu popup itself has to be the Windows' default menu.</p>  <p><strong>What have I done so far?</strong></p>  <p>I managed to create the owner draw menu, but I have the following problems:</p>  <ul> <li>the menu bar rectangle is only as wide as the widths of the items summed up (<strong>I need it to take full window width</strong>)</li> <li>all the menu items are styled uniformly (<strong>I only want the <em>top buttons</em> to be styled like that</strong>)</li> </ul>  <p>How can I get the desired look for my menu?</p>
