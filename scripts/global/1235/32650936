<p>I have an application which is written with MFC. The application uses a c library (there are .h, .dll and .lib files in the lib folder).</p>  <p>Can I sniff the function calling of .exe with the library? I want to know which function of the .h files are called.</p>  <p>More info: the library is D2XX and of course the source code of the application or the debug mode of the application is not available.</p>
