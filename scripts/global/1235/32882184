<p>I want to create a dialog where every box is the same size and has the same margin between each other. Is it possible to do this in the editor or do I have to go to the code behind? As you can see on the image there is different spacing between the controls.(I am using VS 2010 if that matters)</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ddyhj.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ddyhj.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
