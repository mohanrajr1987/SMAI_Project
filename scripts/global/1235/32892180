<p>I have following code where the idea is to read a text file line by line and save the current position m_numBytesRead. So if I break the loop (on my case to split text parsing by chunks on big files) and I try to access a second time by making a Seek of m_numBytesRead-1, the ReadString is not geting the begin of the line as I expected.</p>  <pre><code>CStdioFile fileLog; if (fileLog.Open(m_strReadFileName, CFile::modeNoTruncate | CFile::modeRead | CFile::shareDenyNone)) {     if (m_numBytesRead &gt; 0)         fileLog.CStdioFile::Seek(m_numBytesRead-1, CFile::begin);      bool bBreakLoop = false;     while (fileLog.ReadString(strLine) &amp;&amp; !bBreakLoop)     {          // any condition to set bBreakLoop after few MB read...          if (!bBreakLoop)         {             m_numBytesRead = fileLog.CStdioFile::GetPosition();         }     };     fileLog.Close(); } </code></pre>  <p>By debuging more in detail and comparing with the indexes I get on Notepad++, it seems that the CStdioFile::GetPosition() is not giving correct value, begining of new line to be read, but few bytes (12 on my case) more...</p>  <p>Is is a bug on MFC or is there something I'm missing there ? Does someone see similar issues ?</p>  <p>Note that I'm using VS2010 on Windows 7.</p>
