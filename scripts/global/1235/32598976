<p>I am editing a GUI with Visual Studio 2010. In the resource view I have sized the GUI as in the picture below.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/tGEZT.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/tGEZT.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>However when I run the program this is what it looks like.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/HF1RV.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/HF1RV.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>As you can see the dialog box is bigger than what it's supposed to be. Does anyone know what could be causing this and how to fix it? As some additional information this is the .rc code for the dialog box. Also this is the main application window, not a popup. </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/iTUS8.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/iTUS8.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
