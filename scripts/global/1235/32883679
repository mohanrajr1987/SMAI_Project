<p>I am trying to build VC++ legacy code in VS2013. Initially I was not able to build the code because  of error :</p>  <blockquote>   <p>error MSB8031: Building an MFC project for a non-Unicode character set   is deprecated. You must change the project property to Unicode or   download an additional library.</p> </blockquote>  <p>For resolving this issue I have changed the following settings: Project->Properties->Configuration Properties->General->Project Default->Character Set  ->Use Unicode Character Set.</p>  <p>This has resolved my problem of building the code where as I started recieving errors inappropraite Type Casting error for all my message boxes and for other User defined strings: Sample Code for MessageBox:</p>  <pre><code>MessageBox (NULL, "Some String","Some String", MB_OK | MB_ICONSTOP); </code></pre>  <blockquote>   <p>Error: error C2664: 'int MessageBoxW(HWND,LPCWSTR,LPCWSTR,UINT)' :   cannot convert argument 2 from 'String' to 'LPCWSTR'.</p> </blockquote>  <p>It was all working for VS2010.</p>  <p>Is there any setting I can turn on or off in VS2013 so that I should not recieve such type casting or Do I have to manually type cast for every error.</p>
