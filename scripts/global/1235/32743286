<p>When you hit the <code>WIN+R</code> (Run command) in windows, you get the Run Box:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/BFoYK.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/BFoYK.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>How can I get a handle to this command incase an entry for what I am typing is not found?</p>  <p>For example, this works great when you type <code>cmd</code> or <code>calc</code>.</p>  <p>But when you type: <code>thisawesomething</code> and hit the return key, you are greeted with this:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZbPr2.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZbPr2.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>What I want to do is either of these two:</p>  <ol> <li>Whenever the file, folder or resource is not found via RUN, a default program (which I specify) is fired.</li> </ol>  <p>OR</p>  <ol start="2"> <li>If I can have a program running in the background which listens to an event raised by Windows when it can't find a file, what event am I looking for?</li> </ol>  <p>Is this even possible? I have tried searching for this quite a bit but have hit a wall. Any help or a push in the right direction would be appreciated.</p>  <p>Note: <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/2734/Using-the-Windows-RunFile-dialog-The-documented-an" rel="nofollow">This article</a> mentions that if I fire the RUN command programatically, there is a way to handle the notification of which program is about to be run. However, I am looking to modify (or patch) the default Windows Run functionality and not fire this programatically from another app. Thanks.</p>
