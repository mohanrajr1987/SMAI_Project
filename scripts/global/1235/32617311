<p>I am currently working on a simple web page that will have a couple of YouTube videos embedded in them.  I am adding event handlers for when the video player is ready, and it works great inside of just about every web browser that we care about.  </p>  <p>The issue is we have a MFC application with an embedded <code>CHtmlView</code> that will render this page, but the event will not fire! </p>  <p>Now, I have noticed that the bootstrapping code for the youtube api has a <code>debugjs</code> parameter that it looks for, but I don't know what that does or how to get it to return debug javascript.  I don't see any documentation for this parameter either.  My hope is that somehow enabling this will allow me to download un-obfuscated javascript so I might be able to figure out why the YouTube api is not firing the event.</p>
