<p>I have an MFC application that works with Excel templates and It is throwing out an error (Method 'Select' of 'Range' failed) when trying to select some cells.</p>  <p>I realize that most time the error is when the correct sheet is not active, but in this case it is.</p>  <pre><code>        ws1.Activate();         lpDisp=ws1.GetCells();          range3.AttachDispatch(lpDisp);         lpDisp = range3.GetCells();          range4.AttachDispatch(lpDisp);         vt = range4.GetItem(COleVariant((long)1,VT_I4),COleVariant((long)1,VT_I4));          range5.AttachDispatch(vt.pdispVal);         range5.Select(); </code></pre>  <p>The same code works fine on Excel 2007/2010 with the same template. Does anyone have any idea about what may have changes in 2013 and how I can get around that?</p>
