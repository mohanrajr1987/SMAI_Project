<p>I recently upgraded my Visual C++ solutions and projects from 2010 to 2013. And I am correcting the things that impede them from compiling.</p>  <p>On lines like </p>  <pre><code>m_Impl.GetMenuBar()-&gt;RestoreOriginalstate(); </code></pre>  <p>I receive the error</p>  <pre><code>error C2039: 'RestoreOriginalstate' : is not a member of 'CMFCMenuBar' </code></pre>  <p>If I <em>Go to Definition</em> of <code>GetMenuBar</code>, 2013 has that function and goes to the right place, the file </p>  <pre><code>  c:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC\atlmfc\include\afxframeimpl.h </code></pre>  <p>But if I <em>Go To Definition</em> of <code>RestoreOriginalstate</code>, it goes to </p>  <pre><code>c:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\atlmfc\include\afxmenubar.h </code></pre>  <p>which is absolutely wrong, because 2013 has not this function and this header file belongs to the 2010 installation.</p>  <p>How can I stop <em>Go To Definition</em> to go erroneously to the 2010 sources?</p>
