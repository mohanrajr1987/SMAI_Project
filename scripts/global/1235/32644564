<p>I want to give a pop up whenever I input some number into a edit control in MFC. I have a dialog based application with a edit box in it. Whatever input I give to the edit box, same should be shown in a AFXMessage box. My sample code for giving the pop up is given below:</p>  <pre><code>CString csEditData; m_ChangeEdit.GetWindowTextA(csEditData); AfxMessageBox(csEditData); </code></pre>  <p>I wrote this part of code in <strong>OnEnUpdateEdit</strong> as well as <strong>OnEnChangeEdit</strong> function. The problem I face here is, it will give the AFXMessage box as soon as I enter the first digit. For example I want to give the message box after I enter 102. But I get the pop up for each and every digit I enter. So in this example, If I enter 1, I get the message box with 1. Then for 10 and so on. </p>  <p>The other method I used is to write this part of code in <strong>OnEnKillfocusEdit</strong>. This works the way I want, but I need to press tab for getting the AFXMessage box. </p>  <p>Is there any other solution for the same?</p>  <p>Please note that <strong>m_ChangeEdit</strong> is a CEdit variable, which is my edit box in this sample code.</p>
