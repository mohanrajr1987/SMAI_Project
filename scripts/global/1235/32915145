<p>The MFC application looks weird with 150% DPI settings on Windows 7.</p>  <p>When display settings on Windows 7 are changed to 150% following things happen:</p>  <ol> <li>Toolbar gets expanded a lot making menu items almost invisible.</li> <li>In addition, a black gap get's introduced between the toolbar and application frame (as shown in new)</li> <li>The app used to work fine a while ago (as shown in old). Many changes have been introduced to the app including integration of DevExpress. But nothing particularly changed in DPI settings.</li> </ol>  <p>Need help in understanding why this change might have occurred. And how to get rid of this unwanted zoom effect / DPI effect.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZtZEq.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZtZEq.png" alt="Old and New look"></a></p>
