<p>I want to find <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/" rel="nofollow">Java API</a> like documentation for MFC C++ classes. Where we can get clear information on headers associated,data members and methods for MFC Library. MSDN doesn't look helpful since it doesn't contain information on which header need to be in linked.</p>  <p>Can anyone help me on this. </p>
