<p>I created an MFC app (SDI), and I don't want the menu bar to be dockable. Therefore I commented the following lines:</p>  <pre><code>// TODO: Delete these lines if you don't want the toolbar and menubar to be dockable // m_wndMenuBar.EnableDocking(CBRS_ALIGN_ANY); m_wndToolBar.EnableDocking(CBRS_ALIGN_ANY); EnableDocking(CBRS_ALIGN_ANY); //DockPane(&amp;m_wndMenuBar); DockPane(&amp;m_wndToolBar); </code></pre>  <p>But now what happens is that my menu bar is overlapping the dockable toolbars. What is wrong?</p>
