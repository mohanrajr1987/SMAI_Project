<p>I have an MFC application written with VC6.  I have upgraded it to VS2015 and it builds and runs. The application is a main exe with many DLL's that have dialogs in them.</p>  <p>However the application still <em>looks</em> like it is built with VC6.  None of the GUI components have the Windows 7 look and feel, they all still look old style.</p>  <p>How can I make my existing application look more modern?</p>
