<p>Now, I am showing a modal dialog when I click a button of my software</p>  <pre><code>CDescDlg dlg(this); if (dlg.DoModal() == IDOK) { } </code></pre>  <p>But, when I focus on other software, this dialog is still showing on the top of my screen.</p>  <p>How to hide this dialog when I switch my interface to other software? is it a attribute of this dialog? I cannot find the related materials. </p>  <p>Please help.</p>
