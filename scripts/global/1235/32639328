<p>Using MFC in Visual Studio 2012</p>  <p>I want to use a CMFCColorButton in a dialog in my application.</p>  <p>I added the CMFCColorButton button to my dialog in the resource editor (test it, works OK); click on the button and the underlying CMFCColorPopupMenu is display and stay displayed until manually dismissed (choosing a color or clicking somewhere else).</p>  <p>When I build my application and try the button in the dialog, it works differently, when I click the button, the underlying CMFCColorPopupMenu is displayed and immediately dismissed. If I want to select a color, I need to keep the mouse button down.</p>  <p>I tried in a different application (default MFC application) and I get the desired behavior (click and the CMFCColorPopupMenu stay visible).</p>  <p>I am not certain what could trigger the behavior difference.</p>  <p>I try toggling the CMFCColorButton::m_bAutoSetFocus value of the button and there is no change of behavior. ( I am not certain what is the purpose of this variable, but that is another subject)</p>  <p>Any ideas? hints/tips?</p>  <p>Thanks,  Max.</p>
