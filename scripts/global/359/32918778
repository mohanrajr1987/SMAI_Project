<p>I know this is a noob question... On centos6, I want to allow everyone to view directories and read files in some path while only the owner can modify or delete. I cannot understand whu it does not work. Here is a single file example of what I did:</p>  <pre><code># as user1: vim x chmod 744 x -rwxr--r--  1 user1 user1 6 Oct  2 20:55 x  # as user2: rm x rm: remove write-protected regular file `x'? yes </code></pre>
