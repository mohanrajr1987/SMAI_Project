<p>I am trying to run an SSIS package from SQL Server.  I was able to successfully import the package and run it manually. I was also able to run it manually from the SSIS Catalog. Neither work from the agent job.  Oddly enough, when I set package source to sql server, the package does not show even though it is listed in the MSDB folder.</p>  <p>Account I am running the job from seems to have permission and I am running SSMS as admin.</p>  <p>Any ideas?</p>
