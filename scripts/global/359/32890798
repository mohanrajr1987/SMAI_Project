<p>I need to give access to an external company to one of our users calendar via OWA. I have set up a new user and given them free/busy time access. When I log into the calendar via OWA using the external users details, I am unable to see any calendar entries. When I change the permissions to full, I am able to see all entries including detail which is expected. I need to restrict the external user to free/busy view. Any ideas?</p>  <p>Many thanks in advance,</p>  <p>Keith.</p>
