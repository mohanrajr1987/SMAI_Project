<p>In an example from here: <a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/SplitSettings#ini-stylefilefordeployment" rel="nofollow">https://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/SplitSettings#ini-stylefilefordeployment</a> you are reading the ini from within /etc/. I am using apache2 with my django installation and when I view in the browser you can see the apache2 error logs indicating an issue with ConfigParser NoSectionError. This is because the ini file could not be read due to permissions. What should I set the permissions on the ini file to? Do I need to allow the apache2 user (www-data I think?) to read? What would that look like and is that safe to allow permissions on a file within /etc?</p>
