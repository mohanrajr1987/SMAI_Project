<p>Is there an Intent to go to my Application's "App Permissions" screen in Android-M?</p>  <p>I am making my App ready for Android-M and with the new permissions model. I have followed all the steps mentioned in the link</p>  <p><a href="https://developer.android.com/training/permissions/requesting.html" rel="nofollow">https://developer.android.com/training/permissions/requesting.html</a></p>  <p>Everything is set and all is good accept that if the user has checked the "Never ask again" button and denied permission, on next launch I want to give the user an option to go to the Application's "App Permissions" and change the permission himself, if he ever changes his mind. I wanted to make it a bit easier for the non-tech savvy user by providing a button which would take the user straight to my application's "App Permissions" screen. Is there a way? (It would be much better than giving the user instructions like <code>Menu</code> &rarr; <code>Settings</code> &rarr; <code>Applications</code> &rarr; <code>Manage Applications</code> &rarr; select application)</p>  <p>Thank you for helping out!</p>
