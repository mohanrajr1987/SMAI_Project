<p>I'm trying to access another document root instead of /var/www/html - but I get permission denied. </p>  <p>I have changed the DocumentRoot to point to the new folder. </p>  <pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;         # The ServerName directive sets the request scheme, hostname and port that         # the server uses to identify itself. This is used when creating         # redirection URLs. In the context of virtual hosts, the ServerName         # specifies what hostname must appear in the request's Host: header to         # match this virtual host. For the default virtual host (this file) this         # value is not decisive as it is used as a last resort host regardless.         # However, you must set it for any further virtual host explicitly.         #ServerName www.example.com          ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost #       DocumentRoot /var/www/html         DocumentRoot /root/transmission/completed         DirectoryIndex  index.html  index.php         # Available loglevels: trace8, ..., trace1, debug, info, notice, warn,         # error, crit, alert, emerg.         # It is also possible to configure the loglevel for particular         # modules, e.g.         #LogLevel info ssl:warn          ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log         CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined          # For most configuration files from conf-available/, which are         # enabled or disabled at a global level, it is possible to         # include a line for only one particular virtual host. For example the         # following line enables the CGI configuration for this host only         # after it has been globally disabled with "a2disconf".         #Include conf-available/serve-cgi-bin.conf &lt;/VirtualHost&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I have also added the www-data user to the debian-transmission</p>  <pre><code>root@Flat3:~/transmission/completed# groups www-data www-data : www-data root debian-transmission </code></pre>  <p>These are the permissions for the folder in question:</p>  <pre><code>drwxrwxr-x 3 root debian-transmission 4096 Sep 24 18:55 . drwxrwxr-x 5 root debian-transmission 4096 Sep 24 16:51 .. drwxr-xr-x 6 root debian-transmission 4096 Sep 24 18:26 _h5ai -rw-r--r-- 1 root root                  65 Sep 24 18:55 .htaccess -rw-r--r-- 1 root debian-transmission   10 Sep 24 18:38 index.php </code></pre>
