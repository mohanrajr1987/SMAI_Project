<pre><code>error: could not read data from '/Users/admin/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/AppName-fqotffhinyvhgldyfjeewjtygdpe/Build/Intermediates/AppName.build/Debug-iphoneos/AppName.build/': The file “AppName.build” couldn’t be opened because you don’t have permission to view it. </code></pre>  <p>This actually happening when in console I see "Prosess Info.plist ...". But I don't really think that Info.plist is causing error. What I did or checked:  </p>  <ol> <li>"Compiler for C/C++/Objective-C" is Default Compiler</li> <li>Window - Projects - The app with the issue - delete button in Derived Data </li> <li>Architectures are perfect and the same in Architectures and Valid         Architectures </li> <li>Update to recommended settings, clean project and     clean build folder infinite times. </li> <li>Check Info.plist property in     "Packaging". Checked fields:  Bundle name As : ${PRODUCT_NAME}     Executable file : ${EXECUTABLE_NAME}  Replace info.plist with new     from the project with the same name. </li> <li><p>I just composed new project and     copy all files and resourses to the new project. But even this     didn't help.</p>  <p>Please, help! I'm thinking about suicide.</p></li> </ol>
