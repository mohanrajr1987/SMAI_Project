<p>My manifest only has these 3 permissions:</p>  <pre><code>  &lt;uses-permission android:name="com.android.vending.BILLING"/&gt;   &lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/&gt;   &lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Yet when I publish my APK to the Play Store it lists: </p>  <p>This app has access to:</p>  <ul> <li>In-app purchases</li> <li>Identity  <ul> <li>find accounts on the device </li> </ul></li> <li>Location  <ul> <li>approximate location (network-based)</li> </ul></li> <li>Photos/Media/Files   <ul> <li>modify ordelete the contents of your USB storage</li> <li>read the contents of your USB storage </li> </ul></li> <li>Other   <ul> <li>use accounts on the device</li> <li>full network access</li> <li>view network connections</li> </ul></li> </ul>  <p>It never needed all of these permissions. The last time I updated my target SDK was 20, now it is 22. Does this have something to with it? (My min sdk remains at 14). I have been using Google Analytics from the start. I have also had in app purchases from the start.</p>  <p>This is very annoying because now my users will think I am accessing their media and location which I am absolutely not.</p>
