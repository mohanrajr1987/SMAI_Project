<p>I have an C++ application (linux) which will later be installed to /opt.</p>  <p>Inside this application i need to save some passwords stored in a database file which needs to be placed also inside /opt/fooApp.</p>  <p>The problem is that this file needs to be changed sometimes (like on new user add) but you know we not have write permissions inside /opt so only #root can do that.</p>  <p>My idea was to add a new system group called "fooApp", and change the group of this application / process to it so it can write into /opt/fooApp</p>  <p>The thing is only #root can change the group of files because i was trying <strong>setpgid(2)</strong> but it always return -1.</p>  <p>Successfully i got the group id with: <strong>getpgid(2)</strong> but i think it does not help me now.</p>  <p>I really want to write this database file as #root into /opt/fooApp so no one can delete it.</p>  <p>But also i need to be able to modify it.</p>  <p>.</p>  <p>[EDIT]: I really dont know why i got this stupid negative vote because this is not a stupid question so i saw some people have this problem.</p>  <p>And the solution was so simple! You just need to set the SUID-Bit on the executable application (mine was fooApp) and magically it can create files on the root filesystem for example inside /opt owned by itself and locked for all other ones.</p>  <p>See: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setuid" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setuid</a></p>
