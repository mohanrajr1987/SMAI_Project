<p>I am trying to implement some restrictions on my MongoDB server:</p>  <p>Two databases on my server should be restricted regarding delete/drop operations - only a special user account should be allowed to do so. All the other database should be totally unrestricted (of course excluding the admin database):</p>  <p>I tried to model this situation using two users:</p>  <pre><code>       |   database A &amp; B   |  all the other databases | --------------------------------------------------------- user a |    read &amp; write    |       read &amp; write       | user b |      read-only     |       read &amp; write       | </code></pre>  <p>Making everybody read all databases is easy using the <code>readAnyDatabase</code>role. However modelling that user b can only read database A &amp; B but has read &amp; write access to all the other databases (including those databases that are created later on) gives me a headache. </p>  <p>How can this security model be implemented in MongoDB?</p>
