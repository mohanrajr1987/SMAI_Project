<p>Im starting to build an app where people vote certain stuff just by clicking on happy/sad faces (kind of like grading it). The thing is that I dont want to make a log-in nor registration for my app (the reason is a long story). So is there any way that I can limit people's vote to 2 per day? Every phone/user could only vote twice a day, and that count will reset after 24h from the first vote.</p>  <p>Thanks a lot!  </p>
