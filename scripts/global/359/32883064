<p>I am building a Facebook app which posts Actions to users' Activity Streams. This works fine using an <em>App</em> Access Token. We also need to later retrieve these Actions from the different users. This works per user, with a <em>User</em> Access Token, but <strong>not</strong> with an App Access Token. We need to collect the Actions of multiple users in the app. According to the Facebook documentation, it seems like it <strong>should</strong> be possible.</p>  <p>On <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/opengraph/using-actions" rel="nofollow">https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/opengraph/using-actions</a>, in the section <strong>Reading Actions</strong>, it says:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Read actions published on behalf of a user with the relevant   permissions by issuing an HTTP GET request to the following Graph API   endpoint:</p> </blockquote>  <pre><code>/{user-id}/{action-type} </code></pre>  <p>or</p>  <pre><code>/{user-id}/{action-type}?app_id_filter={app-id} </code></pre>  <p>When an API call only applies to the current user (with a User Access Token), it is customary to use the alias <em>"me"</em> instead of <em>"{user-id}"</em>. The above indicates that it should be possible to read the Actions of any App-user from the App, provided the appropriate permissions are set. Is this assumption correct? </p>  <p>Listing the current App permissions show only the default <em>user_friends, email, ads_management, ads_read, public_profile</em>, but please note that we <strong>can</strong> publish Posts and Activities to App-users. The app is still in development, so we can't apply for any extended permissions just yet. Are we missing something, or is this a bug in the Facebook API? Will it work once the required app permissions have been reviewed and the app has gone live?</p>
