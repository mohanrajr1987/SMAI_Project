<p>I am trying to add permissions to a group for Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ). On Windows Server in the Server Manager under Features I right-click directly on MessageQueuing which is the top level > Properties > Security. I want to make sure my Windows Service or Web Application will have permission to Create a new queue if necessary.</p>  <p>When clicking apply I get the following message:</p>  <pre><code>The security descriptor cannot be set. Error: Access is denied. </code></pre>  <p>Then followed by another message:</p>  <pre><code>Unable to save permission changes on . (null) </code></pre>  <p>I already tried going to Security > Advanced > Owner and change the owner to me, but I get the same messages when I do this.</p>  <p>I am logged in as an Administrator on the server.</p>
