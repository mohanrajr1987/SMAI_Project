<p>I am not quite clear about the difference between different <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms188354.aspx" rel="nofollow">EXECUTE AS</a> targets in SQL Server : <code>CALLER</code>, <code>SELF</code> and <code>OWNER</code>, notably between the last two.</p>  <p>My understanding is that CALLER is the one who Execute/Call the procedure.</p>  <p>SELF is <code>the specified user is the person creating or altering the module</code></p>  <p>OWNER is <code>the current owner of the module</code></p>  <p>Could you explain and give some example who is <code>the person creating/modifying</code> and <code>the owner of the module</code>. Is 'module' here the stored procedure/function or the session or the database ? Including an example with <code>SELF</code> user will be great.</p>
