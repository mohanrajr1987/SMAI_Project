<p>currently my app is using a SQLiteOpenHelper to create or upgrade the underlying database. At the same time the app is creating some default database entries with file paths to images which are created in the following step (onCreate) or updating/migrating filepaths (and therefore moving images on external storage to a new location).</p>  <p>Until Android M everything was ok, because all necessary permissions were available. Now with M and targetApi = 23 my app has no longer the permission.</p>  <p>This shows that my solution was never a good one ;)</p>  <p>Whats the best way to do onCreate-Default-Operations or onUpgrade-Migrations which need permissions? Anyone who has the same or a similar problem?</p>  <p>regards, Thomas</p>
