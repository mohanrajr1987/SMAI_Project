<p>I want to pull ad data (campaigns, ad sets, &amp; metrics like clicks/impressions/ctr) from Facebook using their API and put it into a database.  Facebook's documentation says I need to create an app on their site in order to access the API, but that doesn't seem right.  I'm not trying to create an app for my fb page, just want to extract data.  </p>  <p>My first choice was to use an ODBC driver from</p>  <pre><code>&lt;a href="http://cdn.cdata.com/help/RBA/odbc/pg_allviews.htm"&gt;CData&lt;/a&gt; </code></pre>  <p>, which does allowed me to successfully pull data from AdAccounts but threw an error when trying to get AdSets or AdStatistics:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>OAuthException Code 10: You do not have sufficient permissions to perform this action.  </p> </blockquote>  <p>I made sure to add in a <code>target='act_{myAdAccountId}'</code> parameter to the query, as per their documentation, but it didn't help.  I figured this meant I didn't configure the driver properly, so maybe I'd have better luck just coding up a solution in python or php.</p>  <p>Next, I tried to run similar API calls using the Graph API Explorer and got the same error message.  I created an access token that had all the extended permissions and then made a request to </p>  <blockquote>   <p>GET /v2.4/act_{myAdAccountId}/adcampaigns. </p> </blockquote>  <p>This gave me the exact same OAuthException Code 10 error that I was getting through the ODBC Driver.  </p>  <p>Can someone confirm whether it's possible to pull data from the API without building an app?  If so, what permissions do I need to enable for my account?  I'm already an Ad Account Admin in the "Ads Manager", and couldn't find anywhere else to set permissions. </p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
