<p>I'm using OS X Yosemite in a fresh MacBook. Just installed Homebrew and some essential packages, having moved to this new computer recently.</p>  <p>I noticed that <em>once in a while</em> I get linking errors when I install new brew packages. For some reason, the permissions of <code>/usr/local/bin</code> and <code>/usr/local/share</code> keeps changing back to <code>root:wheel</code> even after I did <code>chmod</code> and<code>chgrp</code> several times to make it <code>FP:admin</code> (FP being my username).</p>  <p>Take note, it fixes the permissions for a time, allowing me to install new brew packages, and changes back to <code>root:wheel</code> automatically at random (at least as per my observation).</p>  <p>Been trying to Google answer to no avail. Any thoughts at what might be wrong with my setup? Appreciate the insights. Thanks!</p>
