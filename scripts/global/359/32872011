<p>I am trying to create a file-level backup solution using Cobian 11 on a Server 2008 R2 (not a dc). I have some secured folders (which are shared from the local machine to others on the network), and I am unable to back up those folders (while accessing them locally). </p>  <p>I'm running the backup as a service under a domain user account, which is a member of the local backup operators group. I thought backup operators were supposed to be able to access all files regardless of permissions. However, when I add the same account to other groups, it gains access to files, which are permitted for those groups. </p>  <p>I should also add that the backup does capture other files in other folders. I made a test folder, and I tried to back it up with different sets of permissions. By default, it allowed the local users group to access the files. With that permission, the backup operator was able to back up the test files. However, when I took that permission away, it failed.</p>  <p>Everything I've read said backup operators are supposed to have access to all files regardless of permissions. So, I'll have to troubleshoot this problem. Is anyone aware of circumstances under which backup operators cannot access local files?</p>
