<p>I'm new with VBA and I'm trying to display the value of cells in msgBox (one after another) when looping through a given column, but the message boxes does not show the values (these ones are not empty or "" in the worksheet).</p>  <p>My code is the following:</p>  <pre><code>For i=2 To workbooks(filename).Worksheets(1).Columns(columnNumber).rows.count     MsgBox "Cell value is: " &amp; Cells(i, columnNumber).address      MsgBox "Cell value is: " &amp; Cells(i, columnNumber).value Next i </code></pre>  <p>The problem is that the addresses are correctly displayed in the MsgBoxes while the values are not. any help will be much appreciated.</p>
