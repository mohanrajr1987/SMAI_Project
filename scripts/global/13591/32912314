<p>I have a cell containing a number with 6 decimal places and I wish to assign it to another worksheet's cell with 5 decimal place precision.  I am using the same variable twice and it works correctly the first time I make an assignment but during the second assignment statement of the Cells Value to a double variable the value is rounded to four decimal places automatically.  I do not have Excel Option to use displayed precisoin turned on.  </p>  <pre><code>Dim i As Long, x As Long, round_prc As Double Dim WSTarget As Worksheet          'OE Price         round_prc = Round(.Cells(3 + x, 9).Value, 5)    ; six decimals assigned to 5 decimals         WSTarget.Cells(1 + i, 10).Value = round_prc         'New Price         round_prc = .Cells(3 + x, 13).Value     ; six decimals assigned to 4 decimals??????         round_prc = Round(.Cells(3 + x, 13).Value, 5)         WSTarget.Cells(1 + i, 12).Value = round_prc </code></pre>  <p>UPDATE:  The Cell Format differs from the OE Price and the New Price.  New Price includes a $.  When I remove the $ the assignment no longer rounds.  Why would currency automatically round to 4 decimal places?  Can anyone explain that?  </p>
