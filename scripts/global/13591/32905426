<p>I have two columns which I'm trying to add to a listbox. The first column has general numbers and the second one has time formatted numbers. When I select a column individually, it shows up in the listbox. The problem is, when I select them both, only the first one is added.</p>  <p>I'm using multiple listboxes and the ranges change in each iteration.</p>  <p>The code I wrote to populate the listboxes is this:</p>  <pre><code>With Controls("Listbox" &amp; k + 1)         .RowSource = "Sheet1!" &amp; Range(Cells(2, i), Cells(97, i + 1)).Address End With </code></pre>  <p>What could be happening?</p>
