<p>I have been searching for a way to add a hyperlink to an email sent through VBA. I found this code but am not sure how to implement it:</p>  <pre><code>Dim ws As Worksheet     Set ws = ActiveSheet     ws.Hyperlinks.Add [a1], "google.com", _       , "Go to Google.", "Google" </code></pre>  <p>This is what I have got so far, I would like to have the word 'here' go to google.com:</p>  <pre><code> Sub email_tracking()          MailFromMacwithOutlook bodycontent:="Hi " &amp; Range("C3").Value &amp; "&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" &amp; "Thank you for placing an order with us, your order has now been packed and dispatched. " &amp; _         "Please click here to track you order. " &amp; "&lt;br&gt;" &amp; " Typically orders will take between 1-2 working days to arrive. " &amp; "&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" &amp; _         "Carrier: Royal Mail " &amp; " &lt;br&gt;" &amp; _         "Tracking Number: " &amp; Range("C4").Value &amp; " &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" &amp; _         "If you encounter any difficulties or have any questions please email us and we will get back to you within 24 hours. " &amp; " &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" &amp; _         "The Logistics Team", _                     mailsubject:="Order Dispatched (" &amp; Range("C2").Value &amp; ")", _                     toaddress:="EMAIL ADDRESS HERE", _                     ccaddress:="", _                     bccaddress:="", _                     attachment:="", _                     displaymail:=False End Sub </code></pre>
