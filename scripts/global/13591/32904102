<p>I would like to select a complete column from an ActiveCell except the first 3 rows, because they are always filled with descriptions/headerlines. I know ActiveCell and EntireColumn, but i don't know how to combine the commands to come to a solution.</p>  <p>So i got like 10 columns to be filled with data, and when the user wants to work on a specific column, i would love to have it so he just needs to click on any cell in the column and then my macro selects the rest.</p>  <p>Edit1: Perhaps the entire column is not the best idea, since i need to add comments to EVERY cell and Excel does not like that. 1000 rows will do it.</p>  <p>Edit2: Picture for reference.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/hr7is.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/hr7is.png" alt="Column select"></a></p>  <p>Edit3: Answered.
