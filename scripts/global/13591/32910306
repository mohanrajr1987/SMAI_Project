<p>I am trying to create a drill down hierarchy that will allow the user to click a cell that has a division like "South" and then below that group of divisions will be all the regions in "South". Then the user can click one of the regions and it will repeat the same thing for districts and locations at the end. </p>  <p>There are 4-5 data points I would like to show in the columns next to the row with the divisions, regions, districts and locations.</p>  <p>I want the division, region, district, and location to expand/collapse depending on if something is selected above it's respective group. </p>  <p>I know how to do this with formulas and combo boxes in excel, but I thought it would be neat to implement and selectionchange using VBA. It will also be much faster as my workbook is very intense already. </p>  <p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>  <p>Hopefully the picture below makes it easier to understand.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/g7CT9.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/g7CT9.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
