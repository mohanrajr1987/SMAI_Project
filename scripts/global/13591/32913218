<p>So I know I asked a very similar question yesterday, its actually about the same code. Former question can be found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32887211/range-of-object-global-failed-excel-formatting/">here.</a></p>  <p>Its 99% complete, but theres a runtime error in the loop that causes it to fail. What I don't understand is that it runs through once, does everything it needs to, then resetting the range variable YTD causes it to stop at YTD.Formula = YTDs. Code below.</p>  <pre><code>    Sub offset(rows1 As Long)     Dim sh As Worksheet     'Integers     Dim i As Long     Dim k As Long     'Movers     Dim current As Range     Dim first As Range     'Metrics     Dim QTRA As Range     Dim YTD As Range     Dim yr1 As Range     Dim yr3 As Range     Dim yr7 As Range     Dim yr5 As Range     Dim yr10 As Range     Dim SI As Range     Dim QTR As Range     Dim YTD_2 As Range     Dim yr1_2 As Range     Dim yr3_2 As Range     Dim yr5_2 As Range     Dim yr7_2 As Range     Dim yr10_2 As Range     Dim SI_2 As Range     'Strings     Dim QTRAs As String     Dim YTDs As String     Dim yr1s As String     Dim yr3s As String     Dim yr7s As String     Dim yr5s As String     Dim yr10s As String     Dim SIs As String     Dim QTRs As String     Dim YTD_2s As String     Dim yr1_2s As String     Dim yr3_2s As String     Dim yr5_2s As String     Dim yr7_2s As String     Dim yr10_2s As String     Dim SI_2s As String      'Puts in the metric names on the top row.
