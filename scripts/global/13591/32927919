<p>I am trying to execute "db2look" command from within Excel using VB. But I'm getting Run-time Error An unexpected token "db2look" was found following "BEGIN-OF-STATEMENT". Expected tokens include: "DECLARE". SQLSTATE=42601</p>  <p>I know connection and everything is fine, as I am able to run simple select queries and based on error it's not connection issue but rather like "db2look" not recognized or valid. I've ran same exact command in cmd window at it works fine.</p>  <p>Just wondering if anyone has been able to run the "db2look" command outside of db2 command window/editor and using VB/Excel? Or if there is something that I am missing.<br> Thanks</p>
