<p>Am Venkat and handle the supply chain function for a retail organization. The company do not have a Warehouse Management System and for inventory tracking and visibility of stocks, I have developed an excel VBA application. </p>  <p>All inventory lying in the warehouse are scanned as per the bins. When an order is received, the application verifies location from where the stocks has to be picked. Once the picklist is created, the application allows the update of the inventory. A user form is created for taking the input which will activate either picking or stock update.</p>  <p>The program was working fine till 3 days back when it is slowing down. Total line items are 26000 and update usually happens for 250 line items. The issue is happening in the update where sheet selection and selection of row which is already picked is deleted. Unable to figure out why the system is slowing down (not responding) and taking huge amount of time.</p>  <p>Need help in resolving the issue as we are dependant on the application.</p>  <p>Experts - Please help.  Am pasting the code for your reference</p>  <pre><code>Dim chklength As Integer Dim skulength As Integer Dim chkqty As Integer Dim skucode As String Dim skucode1 As String Dim tempqty As Integer Dim skuquantity1 As Integer Dim quantity As Integer Dim addqty As Integer Dim pickqty As Integer Dim loc As String Dim rackref As String Dim racksku As String   Private Sub CommandButton1_Click() Sheet1.Select Columns("A:C").Select Selection.Sort Key1:=Range("A1"), Order1:=xlAscending, Key2:=Range("B1") _     , Order2:=xlAscending, Header:=xlGuess, OrderCustom:=1, MatchCase:= _     False, Orientation:=xlTopToBottom Range("a1").Select Sheet3.Cells.ClearContents Sheet2.Select Columns("A:b").Select Selection.Sort Key1:=Range("A1"), Order1:=xlAscending, Key2:=Range("B1") _     , Order2:=xlAscending, Header:=xlGuess, OrderCustom:=1, MatchCase:= _     False, Orientation:=xlTopToBottom Range("a1").Select i = 1  skulength = 13 'While Sheet2.Cells(i, 1) &lt;&gt; "" And Sheet2.Cells(i, 2) &lt;&gt; "" ' chklength = Len(Sheet2.Cells(i, 1)) ' chkqty = Sheet2.Cells(i, 2) ' If (chklength = skulength And chkqty &gt; 0) Then ' i = i + 1 'Else ' MsgBox (" Please Check the DA Loaded") ' End 'End If 'Wend  userform2.Hide  k = 1  i = 1  j = 1  skuquantity = 0  quantity = 0  While Sheet2.Cells(i, 1) &lt;&gt; ""   skucode = Sheet2.Cells(i, 1)   quantity = Sheet2.Cells(i, 2)   skuchkqty = 0   'j = 1   While Sheet1.Cells(j, 1) &lt;&gt; "" And skucode &gt;= Sheet1.Cells(j, 1)     skucode1 = Sheet1.Cells(j, 1)          If skucode = skucode1 Then          'And Sheet1.Cells(j, 4) &lt;&gt; "Y" Then                 Do While skucode = Sheet1.Cells(j, 1) And skucode &gt;= Sheet1.Cells(j, 1) And (skuquantity) &lt; quantity 'And Sheet1.Cells(j, 4) &lt;&gt; "Y"                 addqty = Sheet1.Cells(j, 3)                     If quantity &gt; (skuquantity + addqty) Then                         Sheet3.Cells(k, 1) = skucode                         Sheet3.Cells(k, 2) = Sheet1.Cells(j, 2)                         Sheet3.Cells(k, 3) = Sheet1.Cells(j, 3)                         'Sheet1.Cells(j, 4) = "Y"                         skuquantity = skuquantity + Sheet1.Cells(j, 3)                         k = k + 1                  Exit Do                         'skuchkqty = quantity - skuchkqty                         'j = j + 1                         'k = k + 1                     Else                         Sheet3.Cells(k, 1) = skucode                         Sheet3.Cells(k, 2) = Sheet1.Cells(j, 2)                         Sheet3.Cells(k, 3) = (quantity - skuquantity)                         'Sheet1.Cells(j, 4) = "Y"                         skuquantity = skuquantity + addqty                         skuchkqty = quantity - skuchkqty                         k = k + 1                   Exit Do                         'k = k + 1                         'j = j + 1                     End If                 Loop          End If          j = j + 1   Wend   skuquantity = 0   i = i + 1   Wend   End Sub  Private Sub CommandButton3_Click() Sheet1.Select Columns("A:C").Select Selection.Sort Key1:=Range("A1"), Order1:=xlAscending, Key2:=Range("B1") _     , Order2:=xlAscending, Header:=xlGuess, OrderCustom:=1, MatchCase:= _     False, Orientation:=xlTopToBottom Range("a1").Select userform2.Hide Sheet3.Select Columns("A:C").Select Selection.Sort Key1:=Range("A1"), Order1:=xlAscending, Key2:=Range("B1") _     , Order2:=xlAscending, Header:=xlGuess, OrderCustom:=1, MatchCase:= _     False, Orientation:=xlTopToBottom Range("a1").Select i = 1 j = 1 While Sheet3.Cells(i, 3) &lt;&gt; "" 'j = 1 skucode = Sheet3.Cells(i, 1) loc = Sheet3.Cells(i, 2) pickqty = Sheet3.Cells(i, 3)     Do While Sheet1.Cells(j, 1) &lt;&gt; "" And skucode &gt;= Sheet1.Cells(j, 1)         rackref = Sheet1.Cells(j, 2)         If (Sheet1.Cells(j, 1) = skucode And rackref = loc And Sheet1.Cells(j, 3) = pickqty) Then             Sheet1.Select             Sheet1.Cells(j, 1).Select             Selection.EntireRow.Delete     Exit Do         Else             If Sheet1.Cells(j, 1) = skucode And rackref = loc And Sheet1.Cells(j, 3) &gt; pickqty Then                 tempqty = Sheet1.Cells(j, 3)                 Sheet1.Cells(j, 3) = tempqty - pickqty                 'Sheet1.Cells(j, 4) = ""     Exit Do             End If         End If     j = j + 1     Loop ''pickqty = 0     i = i + 1 Wend </code></pre>  <p>End Sub</p>
