<p>Good Morning (afternoon/evening?) Ladies &amp; Gents,</p>  <p>I have been tasked to create an interim database/data repository (our final custom-made database is in the v early design stage, but we need the data in a half-manageable, consolidated form before then) in Excel 2007 by my boss (in the form of a ridiculously large table).  The format of the table is done – it is a simple affair, of one row = one individual record with many columns, however I am expecting over 200 records to have to be input into it, each being sourced from a separate Excel 2007 workbook containing a number of different worksheets.</p>  <p>My only experience of coding was in QBASIC about 15 years ago; and even then it was pretty much limited to (if I remember correctly) creating a ‘Guess the number between 1-10’ game – so I’m in the wilderness a bit here!</p>  <p>I would be looking for the code to extract data (an ‘x’ or text/numbers) from a number of cells, in columns, and then put it into a new workbook, into rows.  There are empty locked cells within the columns which are used as spacers so that it is easier for the person filling it in to do so.  These should not appear in the summary workbook.</p>  <p>Is this possible?  My alternative solution is to do it all by hand; a task that as you can imagine I do not particularly fancy having to do!</p>  <p>I have looked at other code on this site, but it doesn't seem to take into account the re-format (changing from columns to rows, removing spaces &amp; entering each record in a new row).</p>
