<p>The following macro imports a specific sheet called "Reviewed" from a closed workbook, imports it and renames it "Data". The macro is working fine. However, I want the macro to overwrite the existing "Data" sheet and this is where the code fails. I tried to use the <code>On error resume NeXT .. on error goto 0</code> statement. But it just added a new sheet and didn't overwrite the existing "Data" sheet. </p>  <pre><code>Sub Import()  Dim wsmaster as workbook Dim rd as range  Application.ScreenUpdating = False Application.DisplayAlerts = False      If wsmaster Is Nothing Then         ThisWorkbook.Sheets.Add         Set wsmaster = ActiveSheet         Set rd = wsmaster.Range("A1")         wsmaster.Name = "Data"         filespec = Application.GetOpenFilename()         Set wb = Workbooks.Open(Filename:=filespec)         Sheets("Reviewed").Activate         Cells.Copy rd         wb.Close     End If  Application.ScreenUpdating = True Application.DisplayAlerts = True   End Sub </code></pre>
