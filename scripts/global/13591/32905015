<p>My Workbook has several sheets named Detail1, Detail2, Detail3, and so on. IÂ´d like to color the sheet according to the content of cell B15. However the code is only coloring sheet Detail1 and not cycling through the other sheets. What am I doing wrong?</p>  <pre><code>    Sub Color_by_cell_value() Dim X As String Dim ws As Worksheet     For Each ws In Worksheets         If ws.Name Like "Detail*" Then             X = Range("B15").Value             Select Case X             Case Is = "no"                 Range("A1:AZ100").Select                 With Selection.Interior                     .ThemeColor = xlThemeColorAccent3                     .TintAndShade = 0.799981688894314                 End With                 Range("B15").Select                 With Selection.Interior                     .Color = 5296274                 End With             Case Is = "yes"                 Range("A1:AZ100").Select                 With Selection.Interior                     .ThemeColor = xlThemeColorAccent2                     .TintAndShade = 0.599993896298105                 End With                 Range("B15").Select                 With Selection.Interior                     .Color = 255                 End With             Case Is = "yes/no"                 Range("A1:AZ100").Select                 With Selection.Interior                     .ThemeColor = xlThemeColorAccent6                     .TintAndShade = 0.799981688894314                 End With                 Range("B15").Select                 With Selection.Interior                     .Color = 65535                 End With             End Select         End If     Next ws End Sub </code></pre>
