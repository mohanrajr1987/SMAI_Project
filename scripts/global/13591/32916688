<p>I searched a long time for this, but still inconclusive. Say I have a pivot table with 2 row labels and 1 data variable looking like:</p>  <pre><code>Rowlabel1 Rowlabel2 Sum of value    a          A          1               B          2               C          3    d          D          4    e          E          5 </code></pre>  <p>I want to be able to list the pivot items of <code>Rowlabel2</code> given a particular <code>Rowlabel1</code>, to get <code>"A"" B" "C"</code> in loop, then concat into <code>"ABC"</code>. Whatever I try, it only outputs all of the pivot items, <code>"ABCDE"</code>. </p>  <p>Since the real data is more complex, it is not possible to do it manually. It also have 3 row labels rather than 2 labels. </p>  <p>Don't know if it would help but the solution can also make use of the values. For example, return the <code>Rowlabel2</code> items whose value <code>&lt;= 3</code> when "<code>letter</code>" is <code>"a"</code>. </p>  <p>Thanks for any input!!</p>
