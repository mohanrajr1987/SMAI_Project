<p>I've a lot of sales orders, I've to fill out with a lot of data from different excel workbooks and worksheets. So I need an macro which can do it for me. I have 4 different Excel workbooks. 1 where the data have to be inserted and 3 where I have to get the data from. All the Excel workbooks have the sales orders listed, </p>  <p>So the macro has to scan for each Sales order in each workbook and then get specific data from the workbooks.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/zHWEH.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/zHWEH.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>This is an example of the workbook where I paste the data.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8ktqh.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8ktqh.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Here's an example for a workbook where I have to copy the data.</p>  <p>So it has to copy: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/d34vV.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/d34vV.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>And then paste it into the workbook where I have to paste the data.</p>  <p>If anyone could either give me a somewhere to begin or some piece of code, I would be more than happy!</p>
