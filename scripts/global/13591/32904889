<p>Hi I'm new here so bear with me, I have been investigating on this case for weeks now. I am currently having a problem with Excel Macro trying to scrape IBM iAccess Emulator. The problem is that a particular method in the macro does not work</p>  <pre><code>Dim autECLSession As Object Dim autECLPS As Object  Set autECLSession = CreateObject("pcomm.auteclsession") Set autECLPS = CreateObject("Pcomm.auteclps")  autECLSession.SetConnectionByName ("A")  autECLSession.autECLOIA.WaitForInputReady Dim TestString As String TestString = autECLSession.autECLPS.GetText(11, 28, 8) MsgBox (TestString) autECLSession.autECLPS.SendKeys TestString </code></pre>  <p>There aren't any problem with this code, it's just that in some PC, the method <strong>SendKeys</strong> work while some don't. I have yet to find the pattern on the difference between the PCs. </p>  <p>How it does not work:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>There are no error messages, the line just went pass through as if it   did it job while there's nothing in the emulator, even though the <strong>GetText</strong> method works just fine in all PCs</p> </blockquote>  <p>All testing PCs are Windows7 64-bit, but are vary in specs I have Googled much in the net that It's a problem with the IBM iAccess emulator version, but I have tested 3 different iAccess version</p>  <ul> <li>Version:7, Release:1, Service Level:SI56695 (Emulator Version 6.0 - 20150411 S) </li> <li>Version:7, Release:1, Service Level:SI45664 (Emulator Version 6.0 - 20120315 S)</li> <li>Version:7, Release:1, Service Level:SI00000 (Emulator Version 6.0 - 20091005 S)</li> </ul>  <p>But all produces the same results. We even had a team to record a process monitoring while the macro is being run and compare the different PCs, but they said that the process monitored are pretty much the same.</p>  <p>Anyone have the same problem with me or have an idea what to research about in this case?</p>
