<p>I have coded something to evaluate the result of every possible combination of inputs, in hopes to optimize a solution.  </p>  <p>I have three identical columns of inputs, and my loop cycles through them all in search of the best combinations of inputs to yield the highest output.  Example:</p>  <ol> <li>475,475,475</li> <li>391,391,391</li> <li>24,24,24</li> <li>999,999,999</li> </ol>  <p>Duplicates are not allowed.  I have been able to error correct for this per iteration, but not iteration v. iteration.  As an example the first result I evaluate is 475 391 24.</p>  <p>QUESTION:  The order of the inputs have no impact on the result I am evaluating.  My dataset is so large, it is time consuming to evaluate 475 391 24 and then later again evaluate 391 475 24, and then again evaluate 24 391 475.  Is there aa way to design around this?  I am unable to manipulate the the source data.  I have only a modest VBA skillset, but even the basic concept of solving this problem would be helpful.  I imagine this is a common problem in many programming languages.</p>
