<p>I am currently in the process of analysing data from Excel, and would like to make comparisons between data in Column A and Column B, identifying duplicate data. I am using the following code:</p>  <pre><code>Sub Find_Matches() Dim CompareRange As Variant, x As Variant, y As Variant Set CompareRange = Range("c2", Range("c2").End(xlUp))  For Each x In Selection     For Each y In CompareRange         If x = y Then x.Offset(0, 1) = x     Next y Next x End Sub </code></pre>  <p>This code has been taken from MSDN, so if it finds a match in Column C against Column A, it will display the matched number in Column B. For the most part it does what I need. However I am looking to modify this code so it only matches a number in the list once.</p>  <p>Example of what the code currently does:</p>  <pre><code>A2  B2  C2 1   1   1 1   1   2 1   1   3 </code></pre>  <p>So essentially, because the number 1 appears once in Column C, Column A keeps finding a match. </p>  <p>What I would like it to do is:</p>  <pre><code>A2  B2  C2 1   1   1 1       2 1       3 </code></pre>  <p>So because the number 1 only appears in Column C once, it should only be matched once against the numbers in Column A. </p>  <p>I'm assuming this is probably something simple, but I can't seem to determine the logic. Could someone point me in the right direction please?</p>
