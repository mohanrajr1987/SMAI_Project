<p>I have many cells that have #DIV/0! so I need to put the IFERROR function. Is there a way to apply this formula to all cells instead of putting the formula manually in every cell?</p>  <p>I tried this VBA code but I am looking for something more simple.</p>  <pre><code>Sub WrapIfError() Dim rng As Range Dim cell As Range Dim x As String    If Selection.Cells.Count = 1 Then     Set rng = Selection     If Not rng.HasFormula Then GoTo NoFormulas   Else       On Error GoTo NoFormulas         Set rng = Selection.SpecialCells(xlCellTypeFormulas)       On Error GoTo 0   End If    For Each cell In rng.Cells     x = cell.Formula     cell = "=IFERROR(" &amp; Right(x, Len(x) - 1) &amp; "," &amp; Chr(34) &amp; Chr(34) &amp; ")"   Next cell  Exit Sub  'Error Handler NoFormulas:   MsgBox "There were no formulas found in your selection!"  End Sub </code></pre>  <p>Can anyone help me?</p>
