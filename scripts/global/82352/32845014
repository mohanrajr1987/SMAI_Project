<p>I have a select dropdownlist which I populate with an array of objects. However I can not make the selected property work correctly when I load the page.</p>  <p>I set the array from the controller. I expect something like</p>  <pre><code>vm.regions = [{id: '1b85d387-384a-4fa4-b5ad-b2ddd66e7a14', text : 'London' },{id: '7475bb7e-01da-4f00-bf17-9353ddb01da8', text : 'Paris' }]; </code></pre>  <p>and with this I populate my select with the following</p>  <pre><code>&lt;select class="form-control" ng-options="region.text for region in vm.regions track by region.id" ng-model="vm.section.regionId"&gt;                                  &lt;/select&gt; </code></pre>  <p>From my controller I also get a section object which includes a guid property. This property should match one of the ids in my dropdown list.</p>  <p>If I do it like that when I load my page it can never select the correct value. From what I have read it is because it has to compare the two objects and it cannot make the comparison between the object and the guid even though I think I handle that correctly with track by. I might be doing something wrong there.</p>  <p>The page can either have an empty section object because I want to create a new section or an existing section object because I want to update the existing. In any case if I select something in the dropdown it works correctly.</p>  <p>Also I would like to have eventually another select option like the following.</p>  <p><code>&lt;option value="0" style="display: none;" ng-selected="vm.isSelected()" &gt;Choose region&lt;/option&gt;</code> </p>  <p>As before it always fail to select the correct one so I get an extra option field with something like <code>&lt;option value="?" selected="selected"&gt;&lt;/option&gt;</code></p>  <p>I could in general implement a couple of functions in the controller to do a custom select but I am sure I could handle it in a better way than that. So any suggestion is appreciated.</p>
