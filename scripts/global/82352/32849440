<p>I was wondering if this community could help isolate and solve an issue for me. When you look at this theme demo <a href="http://themetastic.themepunch.com/" rel="nofollow">http://themetastic.themepunch.com/</a>, you can see drop-down submenu on the main navigation (i.e. Home > Home Example 1, Home Example 2 etc.).</p>  <p>However, when I install the theme, the drop-down submenu does not display. It is there in the code, but doesn't display.</p>  <p>Here's what I've done, with no fix:</p>  <ul> <li>updated the latest theme </li> <li>switched from the child theme to the Themetastic theme</li> <li>updated all plugins and WordPress</li> <li>disabled and re-enabled all plugins </li> <li>installed a clean version of WordPress and installed only the Themetastic theme (<a href="http://wp-base.saveda.com/" rel="nofollow">http://wp-base.saveda.com/</a> with the menu Sample Page > Another Sample Page) ...nothing, no fix</li> </ul>  <p>If I switch to another theme, such as twentytwenty, the sub-menu appears. So it's there.</p>  <p>When I look more closely at the code on the theme's demo vs what I have on my site, there is an element style on the demo that appears to be turning the visibility on and off for the submenu that doesn't exist when I install the theme.</p>  <p>For example, the theme demo has:</p>  <p><code>&lt;ul class="sub-menu" style="top: 102px; visibility: visible; left: 0px; width: 177px; display: none;"&gt;</code></p>  <p>which then toggles to this when the top menu item is hovered over:</p>  <p><code>&lt;ul class="sub-menu" style="top: 102px; visibility: visible; left: 0px; width: 177px; display: block;"&gt;</code></p>  <p>While on my installed version of the theme, the submenu code is: <code>&lt;ul class="sub-menu"&gt;</code> that's it, no change on hover</p>  <p>I haven't been able to find a theme option that addresses menu or submenus. I can't see any way to apply an element style to the menu via custom CSS. Is it JS? Their support is giving me the run around by asking me basic questions that I've already answered with 24 hours between every response.... and we're supposed to have gone live yesterday, literally. I just need to find a fix since we've build and customized two sites on this theme.</p>  <p>Thanks for any help!!</p>
