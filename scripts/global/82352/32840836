<p>I have an online html form that uses a select field to choose a record from an existing record list (postcodes specifically) which then auto-populates other fields on the form with the rest of the address. This all works fine except that the dropdown list on the form only goes up so far. I need to know if this a limit on the html dropdown or how many records can be passed to the list in the first place? Also, ideally, it would be great if there was a way to do it via auto-complete so as you start typing the postcode, it only shows those beginning with said characters - is this possible?</p>
