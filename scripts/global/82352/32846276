<p>Client of mine doesn't like the fact that Bootstrap's submenu hide right after the clicks which can be confusing for visitors using slow internet connection - menu item gets hidden, however requested page is not displayed (yet). They may try to click on the menu again and again.</p>  <p>Is there any way how to get the dropdown remain expanded at least until the next page does not start rendering? Thanks a lot.</p>
