<p>I'm using ibm cognos Business Intelligence 10.2.2 FP 2 Report Studio. I have an Active Report where I use two datadropdown lists. In the one list i can select my Name of the car for example "Mercedes Benz" and than in the second ddlist I see only Cars of Mercedes all Modells of Mercedes Benz. If I select an other Carname the second ddlist doesent refresh. I can see other Modells of other Carname but i will see there "Select a Model". </p>  <p>With Cognos Business Intelligence 10.2.1 Report Studio it was possible. And now not. What is the Problem ? </p>  <p>I hope I gat an answer. Thanks </p>
