<p>I'm writing in Javascript a dashboard gadget for JIRA in my work. I set up my test JIRA instance and test my gadget on it. I went through Atlassian tutorials and everything would be fine... but the problem is: I cannot in any way customize dropdown menu in top right corner, marked with small arrow from the level of JS code. There are oprions: Minimise, Delete and pallet of colours(I saw that the class of div which include this menu is "gadget-menu" and &lt; li > tags have classes "dropdown-item" in &lt; ul > with class "aui-dropdown standard aui-dropdown-right hidden"). I'm quite new in JIRA development and everything still remains a little bit unclear for me. I need that for:</p>  <ol> <li><p>Changing type of chart</p></li> <li><p>Customize used data (my plugin use specific filter to receive json with data and then draw a chart from it)</p></li> </ol>  <p>I saw in ready plugins in our company's production JIRA that there is some way to edit this menu (e.g. there is a dashboard plugin with "Edit" option which allows user to customize data used by plugin). If there is a possibility to edit it from the level of my JS code (or any other way) I would be very grateful for help.</p>
