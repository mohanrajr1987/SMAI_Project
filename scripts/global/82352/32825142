<p>I'm having some trouble figuring out why my dropdowns won't close while on a mobile device. These include topbar dropdowns and normal dropdowns. Just to be clear, I'm talking about the desktop version of the dropdowns not their mobile versions, so this only applies to devices with enough rez to show the desktop version of the site.</p>  <p>I have an online example - <a href="http://danizep.com/fd" rel="nofollow">http://danizep.com/fd</a> - just open it using any (I believe) mobile device with enough rez to show the desktop version of the topbar/dropdown, click the "Right Button Dropdown" and the dropdown shouldn't be possible to close.</p>  <p>Tests were performed on iPhone 6 (landscape) and iPad Mini (both on Safari), and also on a One Plus.</p>  <p>Tks.</p>
