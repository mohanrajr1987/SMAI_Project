<p>I have a select dropdown list just like this:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;select name="type" id="type"&gt; &lt;option&gt;First option&lt;/option&gt; </code></pre>  <p>And so on...and I have more than 100 of these options. How can I, through PHP, retrieve the INDEX of the selected value, and not the selected value itself (For example is someone selects "First Option" I'd like to get the value "1" (or 0), instead of "First Option). I know I could just add a "value=1" but it would take a lot of time to add this for all the elements so I'd like to know if there is a quicker, easier method.</p>  <p>Thanks a lot!</p>
