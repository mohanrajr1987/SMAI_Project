<p>Following your recommendation to ask rather than using the answer field, below is my question. (The reason I asked inside a thread was because it was the closest topic I could find, thought it may be in the right environment.)</p>  <p>Please permit me newcomer to add my experience with inability to have a New Window or Tab. Here is my site: <a href="http://zahnerbusse.tripod.com" rel="nofollow">http://zahnerbusse.tripod.com</a></p>  <p>'Been on the search for years for answers - found the most promising here. I am using the good old drop down menu because it is forgiving when typos happen. I don't like it when selecting a line that the current page is replaced by the new one. I want the current page to remain for more selection (kind of table of contents) and the new page in a new TAB / Window. Tab preferred. One menu line enables resetting the menu to its basic (coded) state, because after selecting the new page the menu sits on the last selected line. The [target="_blank"] does not work whether added to the submit area or to the actual URL.</p>  <p>What do I need to change and stay in HTML, please. Just search "menu_" in the webpage code to drive about. Many thanks.</p>
