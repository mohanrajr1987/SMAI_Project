<p>I'm a beginner. I am making a planner or a todolist. The first module (activity main). I made a list view then when I click the add button I have a dropdown category (meeting, lesson plan, agenda, others) after I clicked it and fill out the remaining form. The drop down list that I chose must me on the activity main.</p>  <p>My question is how will the drop down list that I chose will be on the main activity. Thanks! </p>
