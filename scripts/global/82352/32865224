<p>i understand this might be a  weird question but i cant think of any other way to word it/ask it. </p>  <p>i have copied all my code character for character into the below jsfiddle <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/3vqj9z6o/" rel="nofollow">https://jsfiddle.net/3vqj9z6o/</a></p>  <p>on the left hand side there is an option for when/how you want the js to load. when i select <code>onload</code> it does not work but if i select <code>No wrap- in &lt;head&gt;</code> then it does work.  i was wondering how you get it to simulate this in the text editor because currently it is behaving the same way as the <code>onload</code> scenario. furthermore i have tried copying my javascript function into <code>&lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> tags but it is not playing ball this way either. this was working yesterday but now is failing. any ideas? thanks</p>
