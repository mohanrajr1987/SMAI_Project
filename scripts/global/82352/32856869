<p>Users need to select a car.<br> We have several dropdowns when picking a car in order to pick the year, make, model and submodel. Initially we don't know what to use for the select options for make/model/submodel as they are interdependent.<br> Once we pick year we use ajax to make requests which query ActiveRecord to populate the make dropdown.<br> Then when we pick make we use ajax to query and populate the model dropdown. Then when we pick model we ajax to query and populate the submodel dropdown.</p>  <p>The problem is that this is a lot of separate network requests and in real-world conditions of low bandwidth, network issues, etc. quite often there are pauses severely impacting the user experience and occasionally leading to failures.</p>  <p>What approaches could help avoid all these network requests.  In there an approach would could store all of the several thousand makes-model combinations on the client browser?</p>
