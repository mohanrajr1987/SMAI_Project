<p>I'm really struggling to think of what to search for with help on this. I'm not too good with JavaScript so any help would be appreciated. I have a dropdown list, e.g.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;select id="company_name"&gt; &lt;option value=""&gt;Select&lt;/option&gt; &lt;option value="Company1"&gt;Company1&lt;/option&gt; &lt;option value="Company2"&gt;Company2&lt;/option&gt; &lt;option value="Company3"&gt;Company3&lt;/option&gt; &lt;option value="Company4"&gt;Company4&lt;/option&gt; &lt;option value="Company5"&gt;Company5&lt;/option&gt; &lt;/select&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I then have a CSV that contains a city plus some (not all) of the companies above, e.g. CompanyOffice-Relationship.csv</p>  <pre><code>Leeds,Company1 Bradford,Company1 London,Company1 London,Company3 Hull,Company4 </code></pre>  <p>depending on what is chosen in the dropdown above I want to present a new drop down that contains the corresponding cities from the CSV, and if the company is not in the CSV then show ALL cities. e.g. <code>Company1</code> is selected in the dropdown, this would then show a dropdown with Leeds, Bradford &amp; London, if <code>Company3</code> is selected then just London would show, if <code>Company2</code> is chosen then every city would be listed (but preferably not duplicated).</p>
