<p>I am quite new to html and CSS. And came across a big issue recently.</p>  <p>I have 2 divisions in another division. Both of those divs have few buttons etc, and are next to each other - inline. But, when I try to minimize my chrome window, 2nd div moves under 1st, which is great. But, they both are aligned to left of the screen. How could I make them stick to center?</p>  <p>Since I don't know how to explain better, here are some images.</p>  <p>How the divisions look like:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/MWENx.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/MWENx.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>What happens when I resize browser: </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/qvT0C.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/qvT0C.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>What I want to happen with resize: </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/dm77o.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/dm77o.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I sincerely hope someone can offer some type of suggestions.</p>  <p>Many thanks!</p>
