<p>My .ui contains tabWidgets with several tabs. On open, the text in the tabs looks nice.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/HWMmU.png" rel="nofollow">http://i.stack.imgur.com/HWMmU.png</a></p>  <p>When I resize the window, the text in the tabs just shrinks. Even if I go back to its original size, the text remains shrinked.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5Jxxk.png" rel="nofollow">http://i.stack.imgur.com/5Jxxk.png</a></p>  <p>Setting "fixed" size does not help; the tabWidget still resizes. What could be the problem? Thanks!</p>  <p>QtDesigner 4.6.2 Qt 4.6.2 Ubuntu 10.04 i386</p>
