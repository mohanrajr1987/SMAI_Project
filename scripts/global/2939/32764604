<p>I currently have a chart created in my project as follows:</p>  <pre><code>Chart c = new Chart{     Width = 1000,     Height = 1000, }; </code></pre>  <p>This will create a chart that is 1000 pixels wide and 1000 pixels high. My question is, is there a way to have these values set dynamically so that it could take up a particular portion of the screen? For example if I wanted it to take up 80% of the screen's width and 50% of the height, is there a way to tell it to do that instead of giving static pixel values? If that cannot be done, is there a way to simply have it stretch to the size of its container in the HTML?</p>
