<p>I am using parted 2.1-29 on my RHEL6 server to resize a partition which is now 3TB ext4. I want it to grow to 4TB.</p>  <p>According to [url]<a href="http://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=parted[/url]" rel="nofollow">http://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=parted[/url]</a> this is the latest parted for RHEL6.</p>  <p>When i start up parted and i grab the help for resize it gives me this:</p>  <pre><code>(parted) help resize resize NUMBER START END                  resize partition NUMBER and its file system  NUMBER is the partition number used by Linux.  On MS-DOS disk labels, the primary partitions     number from 1 to 4, logical partitions from 5 onwards.     START and END are disk locations, such as 4GB or 10%.  Negative values count from the end of     the disk.  For example, -1s specifies exactly the last sector.     The partition must have one of the following FS-TYPEs: ext3, ext2, fat32, fat16, hfsx, hfs+,     hfs, swsusp, linux-swap(v1), linux-swap(v0), linux-swap, linux-swap(new), linux-swap(old) </code></pre>  <p>So it clearly says that it is not supporting ext4. When i do print i get:</p>  <pre><code>Number  Start  End     Size    File system  Flags 1      0.00B  3299GB  3299GB  ext4 </code></pre>  <p>Is it not possible for me to resize my ext4 partition now with this version? Yum update with EPEL rep gives me no updated version for parted.</p>  <p>Any help would be appreciated in this :)</p>
