<p>Why does <code>static void Resize&lt;T&gt;(ref T[] array, int newSize)</code> exist? (see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb348051%28v=vs.110%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb348051%28v=vs.110%29.aspx</a> )<br/> Or to ask differently: Why is it misguidingly named <code>Resize</code>?<br/> It does not actually resize the Array and it gives the impression (especially to beginners) that such a thing is possible.</p>  <p>It should be something like this instead:<br/> <code>static T[] Clone&lt;T&gt;(T[] array, int newSize)</code></p>  <p>Why was the method designed to work this way? It's definitely not a relic from old .NET &lt; 2 times because it was added with .NET 3.5 (and it uses generics).<br/> Also: Are there any use cases where the alternative signature would not be clearer?</p>
