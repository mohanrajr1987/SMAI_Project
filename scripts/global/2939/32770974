<p>So I'm using Angular-gridster for a dashboard feel to my Angular app. </p>  <p>Each of the individual widgets or items in the dashboard can be minimized, maximized, closed. They can also be dragged and moved around. </p>  <p>When I minimize a widget, I've noticed that it's still resizable, and I just drag the bottom of the widget to any size, without it reloading the widget. </p>  <p>It looks like this: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/IOwwn.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/IOwwn.png" alt="Min widget resized"></a></p>  <p>It looks like the resizable property is set to all of gridster opts, so I need another way to go about it. Any suggestions on how to best go about it. </p>
