<p>I am writing a Python script with a Tkinter GUI. It creates a <code>OptionMenu</code> at run time, with the options I read from file, but the widget keeps changing width with the length of the option</p>  <p>I want to keep the width similar for all of the options.</p>  <p>For example, if the option is <code>"Name"</code> it is small in width, but if the option is "<code>LastName"</code> it increases the widget size, changing the whole layout of the widget</p>  <p>I am using the grid manager in Tkinter.</p>
