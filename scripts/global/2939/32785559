<p>I am wondering two things... Does it make any sense to resize an unordered containers in a manner similar to <code>shrink_to_fit()</code> once the container has been filled and you know there won't be any new items added to it? Probably this is not something you normally want to do, as the buckets are only about pointer size I guess. So... There would not be a lot of space to be won in resizing in most cases anyway.. or would there?</p>  <p>Secondly... what would that function  There is <code>rehash(&lt;bucketcount&gt;)</code>. But is there also a function similar to <code>shrink_to_fit</code> for unordered containers that remove all empty buckets and rehashes the container accordingly? </p>
