<p>I tried to get two divs next to eachother. The right one has a fixed width, but the left one has to be able to resize. I tried multiple ways, but none fit all my requirements:</p>  <ol> <li>Right one has fixed width</li> <li>Parent div has height of largest child (wraps its childs)</li> <li>Left one has to resize</li> <li>Html structure has to in this order (reason at bottom):</li> </ol>  <p>html:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div class="container"&gt;     &lt;div class="variable_width"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;     &lt;div class="fixed_width"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I tried <strong>absolute positioning</strong> the right div and adding a margin on the left one and it achieved all requirements, except that the <strong>parent div doesn't wrap the largest child</strong> (as expected)  <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/0fxL71xL/3/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/0fxL71xL/3/</a></p>  <pre><code>.container{max-width:400px;position:relative;} .variable_width{margin-right:100px;} .fixed_width{width:100px; position:absolute;right:0;top:0;} </code></pre>  <p>I also tried using <strong>inline-block</strong> and max-width but then the divs don't align at the top, and I don't know how to handle the whitespace issue. Most important, it <strong>does not make the left div resize</strong>: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/0fxL71xL/4/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/0fxL71xL/4/</a></p>  <pre><code>.container{max-width:400px;}  .variable_width{max-width:290px; display:inline-block;} .fixed_width{width:100px; display:inline-block;} </code></pre>  <p>I also tried a <strong>float</strong> right on the right div, but it didn't come near what I wanted. The closest I got was changing the order in html and using float:right on the div that has to go right, but in this case I can't use an @media query to have it display below the left div at a certain moment.</p>  <p>EDIT:While paulie_d's answer fixes it, I would prefer something that has a large browser support</p>
