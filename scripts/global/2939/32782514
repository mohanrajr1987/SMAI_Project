<p>I'm building a game in which I can enter a building, which I'm handling via states. In other words, when my character overlaps with the door, the program starts a new state in which the interior of the building is built. Now, I want the interior to have smaller dimensions than the world, so I want to change the game size when I start this new state.</p>  <p>I tried this:</p>  <p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false"> <div class="snippet-code"> <pre class="snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>create: function() {   //game size was 1000x700, I want to scale it to 700x450   game.width = 700;   game.height = 450;      //rest of creation code... }</code></pre> </div> </div> </p>  <p>I also tried things like changing camera bounds, world bounds, world size, but method above shows the most promise.</p>  <p>The problem, however, is that the resize for some reason does not show until I click away from my browser tab and back. Calling game.width in the console yields 700 at all times, but it doesn't show it as such until tabbing out and back.</p>  <p>On top of that, the contents of the game (floor, furniture) are scaled down when the game resizes, defeating the purpose. I don't understand why it would, since there's no scaling anywhere in my code.</p>  <p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
