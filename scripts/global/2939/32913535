<p>I just recently finished my site.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.willigetdivorced.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.willigetdivorced.com</a></p>  <p>If you visit it real quick, you will notice the green border on the right, to add a little readability. If you shrink the window however, you can see it just ends up covering everything. It looks equally absurd on a mobile device screen too. How do I make it so it resizes?</p>  <pre><code>body {   color: #325050;   background: #fff;   font-family: 'Libre Baskerville', sans-serif;   font-size: 80%;   border-right: 50em solid; } </code></pre>  <p>Here's the body portion of my CSS file.</p>
