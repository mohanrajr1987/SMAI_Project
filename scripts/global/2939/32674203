<p>How does one go about making all objects on a form resize in a specific ratio in proportion to the window size. For example if the window is 300x300 and there's a square in the exact middle that is 100x100, if the user resizes the window, how do I resize the square in the middle to keep its ratio of exact middleness, along with all items. The point is to be able to have many different screens using different resolutions and such. </p>  <p>Any suggestions or questions are great.</p>  <p>EDIT: I'd like a function to be able to figure out the ratios rather than me having to figure out each objects' ratio and putting it into the program.</p>
