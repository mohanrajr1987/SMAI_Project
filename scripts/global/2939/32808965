<p>so my question might be a little specific but I just couldn't find any way to make it work: what I want is to have 3 div containers which the user can adjust in size (C is a map while B is a chat and A some other information and I want the user to be able to decide which content he wants to take up the most space). This should be saved after a page refresh or I could save the location/size of the contents for a reload. Here you see what I mean, I want the possibility to adjust C horizontally and A/B vertically </p>  <p>apparently I can't post my image, so I'll just put a link to it here:  <a href="http://lionafire.com/Skizze.png" rel="nofollow">http://lionafire.com/Skizze.png</a></p>  <p>What I've tried is: <p>-resize in CSS, which has multiple problems, first it doesnt save after page refresh (though I could ask for the size of containers I think and reload it) but the bigger problem is that if I resize A, B doesnt get smaller but instead gets pushed out of the screen which I dont want <p>-colResizable: a jQery plugin for tables which would work well for the horizontal C adjustment but not vertically and in addition it doesnt seem to be compatible with bootstrap cause for some reason it stops working when I add this line in the code: </p>  <pre><code>    &lt;script src="http://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3./js/bootstrap.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;       </code></pre>  <p>(I need bootstrap for a dropdown menu)</p>  <p>So I really don't have even ideas left of what I could try and can't find any other tips online, I am using php to save changes in div A, so page refreshes shouldnt reset the resizing.</p>  <p>If anyone has a tip for me and an idea how it could be done, I would really appreciate it :)</p>
