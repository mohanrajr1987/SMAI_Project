<p>We are installing Solaris 10 update 11 (x86-64) and have a small problem. new disks added (or disks resized) are not being recognized by the system automatically.</p>  <p>We have to reboot and configure them manually.</p>  <p>While on Solaris 10 update 9 &amp; update 10, it was working fine. as long as we added a new disk, we could immediately see it in "format" (or after a small "devfsadm -c disks").</p>  <p>On the update 11, nothing.</p>  <p>I have tried all things like :</p>  <ul> <li>cfgadm -al</li> <li>devfsadm</li> <li>devfsadm -c disks</li> <li>drvconfig</li> <li>disks</li> <li>svcadm enable hotplug </li> <li>etc..</li> </ul>  <p>Still can't see any disks added. (nb : it's virtual machines on vmware) and it was working fine with builds 9 &amp; 10.</p>  <p>Any heard of that bug ? Also, what else can I try to force a re scan of disks ? except a reboot.</p>
