<p>Can someone please help me with this question that was asked in my interview ? Thanks in Advance :)</p>  <p>Implement a program in C language which compares performance of various page Â­replacement algorithms. It should take the following as input:</p>  <ol> <li>CPU address size in bits e.g. 64 bits.</li> <li>Page size in bytes.</li> <li>Physical memory size in bytes.</li> <li>Length of page reference string.</li> <li>Page reference locality factor which is a values between 0 to 1. It indicates what fraction of the pages in page string are repeatedly accessed.</li> <li>Memory access time in ns.</li> <li>Page swap time in ms.</li> </ol>  <p>Your program should suitably compare the performance of the following algorithms a) FIFO b) LRU c) Least Frequently Used d) Random.</p>  <p>Performance should be measured in terms of: a) Page fault rate and b) Effective memory access time.</p>
