<p>I have set up the simple O.S XINU to run on Virtualbox following these instructions: <a href="ftp://ftp.cs.purdue.edu/pub/comer/private/Xinu/How-to-install_Xinu-on-VirtualBox.pdf" rel="nofollow">ftp://ftp.cs.purdue.edu/pub/comer/private/Xinu/How-to-install_Xinu-on-VirtualBox.pdf</a></p>  <p>I managed to get through it all and get XINU set up properly (or so it seems) but I have no idea how to actually start making and running programs using this O.S in Virtualbox. </p>  <p>Another thing that puzzles me greatly is how when I look at the list of XINU commands in the manual or online there are many more than I have access to in the XINU terminal. The terminal doesn't even have dir or run commands:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/4liXk.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/4liXk.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I'm not sure if there is something else I need to do to obtain these commands or if I'm just missing something conceptually.. Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>
