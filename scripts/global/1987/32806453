<p>I've got a problem. I installed Hyper v server 2012 on my WIN8 and i think that i override WIN8 to Hyper-V server, cause if i turn on my ntb everytime start up Hyper-V and there is no chance to get into the WIN8. I tried to choose OS, which i wanted to start, but there is no WIN8 anymore to choose just HyperV server.</p>  <p>One time (I don't know how I did this) i get some error in Hyper V server which allows me to open whole folders and i saw that my data on hdd is still ok but i dont have access to them throught hyper v.</p>  <p>So i want now install new OS WIN10 but when i choose option that i want keep all my files... it write me that i should go to my OS WIN8 and make upgrade which i actually cant do. Yes there is a chance to install OS WIN10 by custom choose but it will override my files which i don't want!</p>  <p>So what I want? Get data from my HDD before I install new OS. = I cant get HDD from my ntb any copy it to other HDD!</p>  <p>Is there any chance for example open some folder in Hyper-V server (unset server) show whole hdds and choose the one i need and copy it to for example next hdd?</p>  <p>Thanks for any help! If you have questions? Go on ask me! </p>
