<p>I am a programmer and have recently gained interest in developing an operating system. I know that Assembly and C are needed and I have begun working on C. I know that a very advanced knowledge of both of these subjects are required to develop an OS.</p>  <p>I am interested in creating my own kernel, and hopefully my own GUI.</p>  <p>My question is to where I should find some advice on how to develop an OS from my knowledge of C and Assembly. In clear words, where should I start?</p>  <p>(Please don't just say it's impossible)</p>  <p>What are the conceptual obstacles which need to be overcome before starting? I am looking for a set of resources that will provide me with the knowledge to get started.</p>  <p>If anybody has any ideas, please suggest edits to this original post and list the links here</p>
