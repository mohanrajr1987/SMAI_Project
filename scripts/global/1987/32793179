<p>I have done basic tutorial how to make an OS using this guide:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/articles/zv07M4Gy/" rel="nofollow">How to develop an operating system using C++? x-post: www.cplusplus.com</a></p>  <p>So basically I got a little bit of hand on Assembly with that experience. I would like a recommendation, what types of books I can buy for Assembly and C to get my feet wet? Preferably in OS field. I already know C++ and have experience in web-developing what I am doing now is for web-developing only I only got into C++ because of MySQL to PHP to C++ for my ongoing project. </p>  <p>EDIT</p>  <p>I am not trying to become the best I know developing an OS is not easy task like what I'm doing now. What I just need is to learn Assembly / C preferably books that mention creation an operating system. Please if you know any good books for Assembly / C I would like some recommendation. </p>
