<p>Can we have Operating system with micro-kernel architecture targeted on desktop users? I have read here on this website that older micro-kernel can be 50% slower than Monolithic kernel, while later version like L4 were only 2% or 4% slower than the Monolithic kernel. L4 kernel is very famous for its performance.</p>  <p>Why don't we have an operating system based on micro-kernel architecture targeted on desktop users? Can we have such operating systems in future?</p>
