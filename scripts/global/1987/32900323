<p>I am looking into operating systems to be installed on a wearable device. Note, I plan on building a wearable device from the ground up. As of right now I am still early in the design phase. I have been looking at two operating system which are Tizen OS and Android. This is my first time doing a project like this so any comment would help. What is the best operating to customize to my own liking. I am not planing on have a fancy GUI. Just a simple LCD that tells time, heart rate, and steps with GPS capabilities. Is there any operating system that is lightweight and can be easily customize. </p>
