<p>I am reading about operating systems. I read that when the OS starts, a command interpreter is started as a user process and that when you click in a GUI element, e.g. the desktop symbol of an application, the command to start that application is passed to this command interpreter.</p>  <p>I know command interpreters in the forms of shell or cmd.exe. So does this mean that on Windows when I double click on a desktop icon for, say, word, there is a command interpreter underneath that processes this command? So clicking on the GUI elements equals writing a command in cmd.exe?</p>  <p>And under Windows, what is the name of that process as shown in process explorer?</p>
