<p>I know that some programmes like Java or .NET programmes use an extensive runtime system for execution. But I read something in a book about OS (which isnt explained in more detail there) that sounds like ANY programme written by a user runs in a runtime system and not directly on the operating system. </p>  <p>An example given is that when you read a file, you dont call an operating system function for each bit you read, instead you read the bits or bytes into a buffer managed by the runtime system and when that's empty, you call a system function again.</p>  <p>So does that mean that strictly speaking, any programme runs in a runtime environment of some kind (except maybe prgrammes written in assembly...)?</p>
