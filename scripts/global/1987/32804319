<p>I have Lenovo (G580 Model 20157) laptop. It had Windows 8.1. I dual booted it with Ubuntu 15.04.  I am unable to go into BIOS setup since then. I tried that by:</p>  <ol> <li>Pressing F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, F6, F7, F8, F9, F10, F11, F12, Del and Esc keys.</li> <li>By using Novo button.</li> <li>From windows 8.1 Update and recovery options.</li> <li>By turning of fast start up option and hibernate option in power options.</li> <li>Using Shift key while shutting down for complete shut down.</li> </ol>  <p>But it didn't work. When I pressed Esc key it says "<strong>System bios shadowed Video BIOS shadowed</strong>"  [![enter image description here][1]][1]</p>  <p>I tried to find the BIOS update for Windows 8.1 but I didn't find it. Please help me in solving this.</p>
