<p>I want to get a notification at a specific time, say at 8am and 8pm even if my application is not running.</p>  <p>Application must receive notification even if OS kill my application from background due to low memory.</p>  <p>I don't want to use Push Notification as it will require a dedicated server which I don't have.</p>  <p>Is there any functionality like iOS has, where OS send notification or Silent message to application irrespective if application is in memory or it is closed/Forced stop by OS/user.</p>
