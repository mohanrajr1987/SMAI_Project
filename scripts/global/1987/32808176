<p>Here are my specs :</p>  <p>CPU : 2x Core 2 Duo E4600 @2.4GHz.</p>  <p>RAM : 4GB.</p>  <p>GPU : AMD 4300/4500 HD Series.</p>  <p>This is not my main PC but after installing Win 10 I noticed a lot of lag and I don't want to install either 7 or 8.1 .</p>  <p>I am a complete newbie to Lunix so I have no preference although I'd want a distro which would fully use my pc (especially the gpu).</p>  <p>I read that Linux Mint is closest to Windows but that's not a viable reason for choosing an <em>OS</em> . I'll probably go with Ubuntu since it is the most popular (= better support ???) but I thought I'd get some advice first.</p>
