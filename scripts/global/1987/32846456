Given an address, the Operating System(OS)/Memory Management Unit(MMU) translates it to a primary memory location. </p>  <p>My questions are:</p>  <p>In the scenario that the page is absent in primary memory</p>  <ol> <li>How does the OS know where to find the page on disk?</li> <li>Where does it store information for 1?(It is not stored in the page table entry). Links to code examples would be great!</li> </ol>
