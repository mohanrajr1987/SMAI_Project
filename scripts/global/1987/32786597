<p>Is it possible to run windows 7 (of pc) in android device.. I mean operating system needs space and RAM right? We have space and RAM in mobiles now a days to be able to run win 7.. So is it possible to install win 7 in mobile. I know tht screen would see small and all but still .. Is it possible, If yes then is it possible for linux as well?</p>
