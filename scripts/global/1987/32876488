<p>I want below run time information of my hardware (linux OS, mostly Intel but if give other architecture like AMD than also it's fine.).</p>  <pre><code>how many cpu how many thread per core core per socket number of socket. </code></pre>  <p>One way is to use lscpu, but I want this information in C++ programm.</p>  <pre><code>lscpu Architecture:          x86_64 CPU op-mode(s):        32-bit, 64-bit Byte Order:            Little Endian CPU(s):                16 On-line CPU(s) list:   0-15 Thread(s) per core:    1 Core(s) per socket:    8 CPU socket(s):         2 NUMA node(s):          4 Vendor ID:             AuthenticAMD CPU family:            16 Model:                 9 Stepping:              1 CPU MHz:               800.000 BogoMIPS:              4000.40 Virtualization:        AMD-V L1d cache:             64K L1i cache:             64K L2 cache:              512K L3 cache:              5118K NUMA node0 CPU(s):     0-3 NUMA node1 CPU(s):     4-7 NUMA node2 CPU(s):     12-15 NUMA node3 CPU(s):     8-11 </code></pre>  <p>Is there any function in c++ that give me all this information. My application is in userspace.</p>
