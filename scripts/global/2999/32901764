<p>I am trying build one sample ROR web application. I tried to access a set of ids from request params and fetch the result form DB for those params. My param is an array of ids. I am getting proper output. Only thing if I send some wrong values in array of ids then it is not giving output. Terminating with error which says could not find all values for those ids. I am doing all these in following way :</p>  <pre><code>if(params[:m_id])   @m = @man.me.find(JSON.parse ((params[:m_id]).encode!('UTF-8'))) end </code></pre>  <p>Shall I try with <code>Begin Rescue</code> or there some other better ways.Need some help. Thank you.</p>
