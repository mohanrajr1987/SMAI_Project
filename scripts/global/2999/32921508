<p>I have a <code>CartController</code>, which, on <code>showCheckout</code>, does this:</p>  <pre><code>    ModalService.showModal({         templateUrl: '/Product/CartCheckout',         controller: 'CartController' }).then(function (modal) {         ...     }); </code></pre>  <p>This is based on <a href="https://github.com/dwmkerr/angular-modal-service" rel="nofollow">angularModalService.js</a>. I'm just passing the current controller because I wouldn't like to create a new controller just to handle the <code>Open()</code> and <code>Close()</code> of the modal dialog. </p>  <p>However, passing a controller just by name seems to instantiate a new instance of that controller. I want to pass the current instance of my controller to the service. I've tried:</p>  <pre><code>   controller: $controller('CartController', $scope) </code></pre>  <p>But I get <code>Unknown provider: $scopeProvider &lt;- $scope &lt;- CartController</code>.  I've also tried:</p>  <pre><code>  controller: $scope.ctrl </code></pre>  <p>But it just seems to be ignored without throwing any errors, nothing happens and the dialog is never shown.</p>
