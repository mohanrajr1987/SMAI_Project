<p>I need to remove the controller 'Home' from the URL of my project, now it looks like this: example.com/Home/contact and i want it to look like this: example.com/contact (also for other sections as services, our-team, gallery, etc.)</p>  <p>I tried to remove the '{controller}' that appears before '{action}/{id}' in RouteConfig.cs code, like this:</p>  <pre><code>namespace myproject { public class RouteConfig {     public static void RegisterRoutes(RouteCollection routes)     {         routes.IgnoreRoute("{resource}.axd/{*pathInfo}");          routes.MapRoute(             "Default",             "{action}/{id}",             new { controller = "Home", action = "Index", id = UrlParameter.Optional }         );     }     } } </code></pre>  <p>And the controller 'Home' disappears from the URL, but the following links to login and Manage do not work:</p>  <pre><code>@Html.ActionLink("Login here", "Login", "Account") @Html.ActionLink("Manage website", "Index", "Manage") </code></pre>  <p>How could i make those links work without displaying the controller 'Home' in the URL?</p>
