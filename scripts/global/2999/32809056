<p>This is my first question on StackOverflow and I hope someone can help me. :-)</p>  <p>I am planning to build a web-application (backend) with spring roo. For the backend I will use Spring and Hibernate/JPA. In the future I will implement a web client (JSF/Primefaces), a mobile client (Android) and a Windows App.  With spring roo it is easy to create a layered architecture with domain classes, repositories and services. This part is fun. </p>  <p>But now I am thinking about remoting and how to connect all the clients (web, mobile, windows) with my backend. </p>  <p><strong>1.) What do you prefer for the remoting between client and backend? SOAP-Web Services or a REST-API (e.g. with JSON).</strong></p>  <p><strong>2.) If REST-API: How should the API look like for authentication/login functionality? REST is resource-oriented but how do you implement authentication with REST API?</strong></p>  <p>At the moment I think a REST-API is a good idea. Because I am using spring it is easy to create a Spring MVC controller with REST support. But is this the correct way to implement a REST API for all the three devices? The web client e.g. should be implemented with JSF and Primefaces and I donÂ´t use spring MVC for the web layer. </p>  <p><strong>3.)Can I nevertheless use Spring MVC controllers to build the REST API (together with JSF in the web layer)? Or is there a better way?</strong></p>
