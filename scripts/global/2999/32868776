<p>I am using Symfony 2 and having a little issue with an embeded form.</p>  <p><strong>The situation :</strong></p>  <p>MyBundle/Resources/views/Portions/footer.html.twig view which is included in the MyBundle/Resources/views/layout, and of course the layout.twig.html is extended by all the bundle views. Whish means that footer.html.twig is displayed in all the pages.</p>  <p><strong>The question / problem :</strong> </p>  <p>I want to embed a newsletter form (one input) in the footer.html.twig, that would be handled by one controller (validate data, database insert, and email send), and afterward, returning to the same page.</p>  <p>What is the optimized solution to handle this ?</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
