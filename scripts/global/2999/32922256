<p>My Angular app would be consisted of 2 HTML, 1 controller.js, 1 service.js and 1 state.js. In first html file I have one button. I want on click on the button to transferred to state "getExam" in state.js, in which the controller would be called with a method getOldestExam, and from that method the service "getOldestExam()".  First I tried with ng-Click(), and it is transferring me to "getOldestExam" controller ok, but the problem I have is that I want the result from the controller to be printed in the second HTML(the scope of the result to not be lost)?  I tried a second solution instead of using ng.click() I am using ui-sref="exam({uuid}), that is changing the state fine in which is the second HTML called, but I cannot call the controller from the State successfully? Can someone suggest me a correct approach or solution?</p>
