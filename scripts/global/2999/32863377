<p>I'm looking into an issue with Angular 1.4 (which was working in Angular 1.3). I have a directive that contains a controller like this:</p>  <pre><code>myDirective = ['myService', (myService) -&gt;   restrict: 'A'   templateUrl: '../../shared/scripts/directives/myTemplate.html'   controller: [ '$scope', ($scope) -&gt;     this.setId = (id) -&gt;       $scope.id = id   ]  ] </code></pre>  <p>Then I have another directive that uses the controller of "myDirective" like this:</p>  <pre><code>mySecondDirective = ['myService', (myService) -&gt;   require: 'myDirective',   restrict: 'A'   link: (scope, element, attrs, myDirectiveCtrl) -&gt;     myDirectiveCtrl.setId 1 ] </code></pre>  <p>In Angular 1.3 the require of the directive was enough for "mySecondDirective" to use the controller of "myDirective". But now it can't find the "setId" function anymore. I get the following error: "myDirectiveCtrl.setId is not a function."</p>  <p>Anyone knows how to fix this?</p>
