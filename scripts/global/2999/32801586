<p>I've an <code>AuthenticatorService</code> module located in the file <code>app/services/authenticator_service.rb</code>.</p>  <p>This module looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>module AuthenticatorService    # authenticate user with its email and password   # in case of success, return signed in user   # otherwise, throw an exception   def authenticate_with_credentials(email, password)     user = User.find_by_email(email)     raise "Invalid email or password" if user.nil? or not user.authenticate password      return user   end    # some other methods...  end </code></pre>  <p>I currently use this module in my <code>SessionsController</code>.</p>  <pre><code>class V1::SessionsController &lt; ApplicationController   # POST /sessions   # if the credentials are valid, sign in the user and return the auth token   # otherwise, return json data containing the error   def sign_in     begin       user = AuthenticatorService.authenticate_with_credentials params[:email], params[:password]       token = AuthenticatorService::generate_token user        render json: { success: true, user: user.as_json(only: [:id, :first_name, :last_name, :email]), token: token }     rescue Exception =&gt; e       render json: { success: false, message: e.message }, status: 401     end   end end </code></pre>  <p><code>SessionsController</code> is in the namespace <code>V1</code> because it is located in <code>app/controllers/v1/sessions_controller.rb</code> but that's not the problem here.</p>  <p>The problem is that, when I call the route corresponding to <code>SessionsController::sign_in</code>, I go the following error: <code>undefined method 'authenticate_with_credentials' for AuthenticatorService:Module</code>.</p>  <p>I can't understand why I get this error in development and production environments for multiple reasons:</p>  <ul> <li>When I add debug information, I can see that the AuthenticatorService is loaded and accessible from the controller</li> <li>Moreover, when I display the public instance methods, <code>authenticate_with_credentials</code> is listed in the result (<code>puts AuthenticatorService.public_instance_methods</code>)</li> <li>In my test, this controller is tested and everything works as expected... </li> </ul>  <p>Maybe someone could give me some help.</p>
