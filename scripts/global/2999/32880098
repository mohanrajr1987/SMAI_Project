<p>I am new in ionic. I created a sidemenu based app in that after login I am displaying a number of tasks if click on task it will redirect to task details page in that page I can update the tasks. So after updating a task I need to go back to previous task list page .I am using $ionicHistory.goBack(); for go back. </p>  <p>My problem is after come back I need to refresh the task list i.e. updated task should not be there in the task list how can I refresh/reload the task list? Thanks in advance.</p>
