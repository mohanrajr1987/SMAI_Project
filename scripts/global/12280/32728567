<p>From what I understand, the </p>  <pre><code>remove() </code></pre>  <p>function is not supported in IE. I have a JS function that creates a div and appends it to an existing list.The div contains another div styled as a button (this is the 'item' in the title, that's what I called it when I got it from HTML), which, on click, removes its parentNode(and consequently itself) from the DOM(by means of remove()), though it still 'exists' in that JavaScript can read it's data and stuff. I need a way to remove it from the DOM, as well as all of it's child elements. Setting it's innerHTML equal to nothing will not work, nor will setting it's display to none. Any idea how to do this in a way compatible with IE? </p>  <p>Any help appreciated, please no jQuery or other frameworks.</p>
