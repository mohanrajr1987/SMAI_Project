<p>I have a jsp page which has the displays the status of various jobs that are running. Sone of these jobs are long running, so it takes a while for their status to change from processing to complete.</p>  <p>Is it a good idea to have a javascript function that would refresh the page every 30 seconds or so? Are there any ramifications for having a script that is constantly refreshing a page?</p>  <p>The other option is to have a refresh button which on click would refresh the page.</p>
