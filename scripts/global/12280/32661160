<p>I have a simple, but complex issue. I'm building a UI component in React.Js which uses knobs. The knobs can be turned from left to right (like a physical knob can), and will render the appropiate knob heading (North, South, etc), based off how much the user dragged their cursor (all this happening in real time). So, I'm listening for the "onDragStart" event to get the initial heading (on the Y-axis)  of the knob, and then adding the "mouse move" event to the document's event listeners, and taking the Y-axis movement from the "mouse move" event  in comparison to the initial Y-axis from the "onDragStart" event to find the Delta from the drag, and then render the appropriate image. The problem comes when I try to unregister the events from the document (you know, good programming practices) based off the "mouse up" event (since the user will release the mouse button when reached their desired heading). Based off my attempt to print to the console whenever the "mouse up" event is heard by the browser, I've come to the conclusion that (since nothing is printed), the mouseUp event is not being heard, and as a result the dragStop method is not being ran. I've pasted my code below (in JS and JSX), and please don't hesitate to ask for a clearer explanation. Thanks in advance - Justin </p>  <pre><code>    var Knob = React.createClass({   getInitialState: function(){     return{season: this.props.season };   },    //Default properties   getDefaultProps: function () {     return { season: 1 };   },    //Start the drag functionality   drag_start: function(data){      // Store current      this.clientY = data.clientY;     console.log("current location is: "+this.clientY);      //Register      document.addEventListener('mousemove', this.drag);     console.log("run");     document.addEventListener('mouseup', this.dragStop);     console.log("run");   },    drag: function(data){     // Compare how far     console.log("New location IS: "+data.clientY);     var deltaY = data.clientY - this.clientY;      // Do stuff with delta     console.log("Difference is" + deltaY);      // Store new current location     this.clientY = data.clientY;   },    //Unregister the drag event from the document   dragStop: function () {     console.log("ran drag stop");     document.removeEventListener('mousemove', this.drag );     document.removeEventListener('mouseup', this.dragStop);   },   render: function(){     return(            &lt;div&gt;             &lt;img src = "../style/img/wood-bg.png" /&gt;              &lt;img src ={ '../style/img/Seasons/sprites_cut/'+this.state.season+'.png'} ref = "season" onDragStart = {this.drag_start} /&gt;            &lt;/div&gt;     );//Ed   } //end render function }); //end knob class  React.render(&lt;Knob /&gt;, mountNode); </code></pre>
