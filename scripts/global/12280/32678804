<p>I would like to apply the <strong>click</strong> event (or any other event) <strong>automatically</strong> to <strong>every HTML element</strong> on the page.</p>  <p>I am developing kind of a "clicking game" and would like to use <strong>one generic JavaScript function</strong> that will handle every click on every HTML element on the page.</p>  <p>Is this possible at all?</p>
