<p>I am pretty new in JQuery and I have the following problem.</p>  <p>Into my HTML I have a link like this:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;a&gt;SAIC831003&lt;/a&gt; </code></pre>  <p>When the link is clicked I need to perform a JQurey script when this link is clicked and into this script retrieve the content of the <strong></strong> tag.</p>  <p>I think that I can use an <strong>onClick()</strong> on the  tag (but I don't know if it is the best solution) and I don't know how retrieve the content.</p>
