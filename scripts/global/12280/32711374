<p>In C# by i have executed JavaScript by ExecuteScript() function. In JavaScript I have added an EventListener to webpage by clicking an button say 'Attach'. Now i want to remove that EventListener on another button click say 'Detach'.</p>  <p>Now under 'Attach' button Form. I have written following</p>  <pre><code>document.addEventListener('click', hilightElement, false); </code></pre>  <p>where highlightElement is my function.</p>  <p>Under 'Detach' button Form. I have written following</p>  <pre><code>document.removeEventListener('click', hilightElement); </code></pre>  <p>here document.removeEventListener does not work i.e the EventListener which i added still exist.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Is  there any way that i can remove the event listener so that 'click' event does not do anything after 'Detach' button click.</p> </blockquote>
