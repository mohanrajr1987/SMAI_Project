<p>I have a code like this and it's working, it activates on click and keyup:</p>  <pre><code>Backbone.View.extend({     events: {         "click .item": "clicked",         "keyup .item": "keyupped"     }, clicked: function(a) {     var $item = $(a.currentTarget); ...} keyupped: function(a) {     var $item = $(a.currentTarget); ...} </code></pre>  <p>But I would like to make keyup to work only with space and enter and I can't get it to work. This is the idea I have, but I can't explain to myself what the event object a represents. In the simple function, it works. But in something like this, it doesn't:</p>  <pre><code>keyupped: function(q) {     if(q.which == 13 || q.which == 32) {         function(a) {var $item = $(a.currentTarget); ...} </code></pre>  <p>I don't understand the event object. I understand that in the keyup function it contains keycode data, but what it represents as a whole?</p>  <p>How should I write my keyupped function?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
