<p>I have a "beforeunload" handler on my page to catch situations where the user hasn't saved before, for instance, closing the tab.</p>  <p>The code looks like this :</p>  <pre><code>$(window).bind("beforeunload", function(evt) {      if (TCG.QUE.changeCount &gt; 0){         evt.preventDefault();         var errDlgMsg = "You have unsaved answers. Save the answers before leaving this page or the unsaved answers will be lost.";         bootbox.alert({message: errDlgMsg, title: "Unsaved Answers"});         return false;     } }) </code></pre>  <p>When it fires before the <a href="http://bootboxjs.com/" rel="nofollow">bootbox</a> dialog firing another dialog is displayed which looks like this </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/mBEbx.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/mBEbx.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I don't want to see that dialog because the bootbox dialog is intended to do the same job . How can I suppress that dialog ?</p>
