<p>I'm working on adding keyboard controls to a datepicker for accessibility. I want to use pageup and pagedown keys to toggle between the next and previous months. As part of the code I'm using <code>e.preventDefault</code> to prevent the page from being scrolled up or down only when the datepicker is open. I have it working in Firefox and IE, but not in Chrome or Safari.</p>  <p>I'm not posting the full code here, but I created test code below. No matter what I try, the page still scrolls up/down when these keys are pressed in Chrome or Safari. I can't use up, down, left, or right keys because they are used to navigate the focus  between days within each month.</p>  <pre><code>$(window).keyup(function(e) {     console.log(e.keyCode);     if(e.keyCode === 34) {          console.log('page down');          e.preventDefault();         e.stopPropagation;         e.stopImmediatePropagation();         return false; } </code></pre>
