<p>On my site, except some spesific pages (login, register, pwd reset) users are required to login. I have implemented <code>remember me</code> feature and it works well.</p>  <p>What I would like to achieve is, for administration pages, users should have <code>admin role and not remembered</code>. To check this requirement I used <code>allow_if</code> in the relevant access_control rule, however it denies my admin user's access, although session is not remembered and I can confirm that session has <code>UsernamePasswordToken</code> on debug toolbar.</p>  <p>My access_control rules are as follows: (<strong>4th one doesn't work</strong>)</p>  <pre><code>access_control:     - { path: ^/login$, role: IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY }     - { path: ^/user/register, role: IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY }     - { path: ^/user/resetting, role: IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY }     - { path: ^/admin, allow_if: "has_role('ROLE_ADMIN') and has_role('IS_AUTHENTICATED_FULLY')" }     - { path: ^/, role: IS_AUTHENTICATED_REMEMBERED } </code></pre>  <p>If I remove <code>and has_role('IS_AUTHENTICATED_FULLY')</code> part from the relevant access control rule, user can pass authorization so the problem seems to be this part. </p>  <p>What is the problem with <code>has_role('IS_AUTHENTICATED_FULLY')</code> ?</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Symfony Version: 2.7.5</p> </blockquote>
