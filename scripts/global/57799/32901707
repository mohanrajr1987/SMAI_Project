<p>I have many Ads entities for which I am developing manager services. These entities are (let's say): <strong>MotorAds</strong>, <strong>RealestateAds</strong>, <strong>ElectronicsAds</strong>,...</p>  <p>To do that, I did the following:</p>  <ul> <li><p>I created an AbstractManager in which I defined all the common methods (such as <em>find()</em>, <em>findAll()</em>, ...)  </p></li> <li><p>I extended <strong>AbstractManager</strong> to define <strong>MotorManager</strong>, <strong>RealestateManager</strong>, <strong>ElectronicsManager</strong> </p></li> <li><p>I created services for all these manager as it is shown in this link <a href="http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/dependency_injection/parentservices.html" rel="nofollow">Managing Common Dependencies with Parent Services</a></p></li> </ul>  <p>Since all my Ads entities implements a <strong>FavoriteAwareInterface</strong> which is defined as follows:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php  namespace Minn\AdsBundle\Manager\Doctrine;  interface FavoriteAwareInterface {      function addFavorite($favorite);      function removeFavorite($favorite);      function getFavorites(); } </code></pre>  <p>So, here are my questions:</p>  <ol> <li><p>Is it possible to create a service named favorite to be injected to the managers <strong>MotorManager</strong>, <strong>RealestateManager</strong>, <strong>ElectronicsManager</strong>? </p></li> <li><p>If you have a good article to read regarding that, I will be happy!</p></li> </ol>  <p>Thanks,</p>
