<p>I'm running amazon EC2 VPC, normaly use Centos and I have no problem with it, but I have tried Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 7.1, and I have installed everything from scratch.</p>  <p>I'm using Symfony 2.7.5, and I really struggling with the cache.</p>  <p>The web application seams to not have access to the cache folder (app/cache)  </p>  <pre><code>RuntimeException in bootstrap.php.cache line 2671: Unable to create the cache directory (/var/www/mysite/app/cache/dev) </code></pre>  <p>I have researched a lot and tried all, change ownership, give full accesss to the folder cache...</p>  <pre><code>chown -R root:apache app/cache chown -R root:apache app/logs  chmod -R 777 app/cache chmod -R 777 app/logs  sudo setfacl -R -m u:apache:rwX -m u:ec2-user:rwX app/cache app/logs sudo setfacl -dR -m u:apache:rwx -m u:ec2-user:rwx app/cache app/logs </code></pre>  <p>In the command line I can use <strong>php app/console cache:clear</strong> and it works. I dont know if its a problem with this Symfony's version or its some kind configuration problem. Thanks for the help.</p>
