<p>I have a form that I display row by row in Twig. On a particular row, I try to pass HTML attributes as options, like this : </p>  <pre><code>{{ form_row(form.classic_text, {'attr': {'class': 'test'}}) }} </code></pre>  <p>The option is passed to the form, as I can see the class being applied to the form. However, when I put a dump right after the above code, like this : </p>  <pre><code>{{ form_row(form.classic_text, {'attr': {'class': 'test'}}) }} {{ dump(form.classic_text) }} </code></pre>  <p>the <code>attr</code> array is empty. Any idea why ? Thanks for reading, I can provide more information in needed.</p>
