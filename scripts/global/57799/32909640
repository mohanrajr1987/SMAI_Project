<p>I have a date field which when you look at advanced options, you have the following default operands which are all useful:</p>  <ol> <li>=</li> <li><blockquote>   <p>=</p> </blockquote></li> <li>></li> <li>&lt;=</li> <li>&lt;</li> <li>is empty</li> <li>is not empty</li> </ol>  <p>I need the same list of options and then add 'between' as one of the options then maybe using javascript add a second date field for the date range limits.</p>  <p>Anyone know how I can get to do this? Thanks in advance</p>
