<p>I am looking for  way to create a colormap in python/matplotlib that is specific to a designated integer value and remains that integer value. Here is an example of how I define the matlab colormap:</p>  <pre><code>c_map = [1   1   1;...     % Integer assignment = 0 - Air - white          0.6 1 0.8;... % Integer assignment = 1 - Water - cyan          1 0.6 0.2];   % Integer assignment = 2 - Sediments - orange </code></pre>  <p>it is later called during the plotting routine by: </p>  <pre><code>colormap(c_map); pcolor(xvec,zvec,ColorIntegers); shading interp, colormap, caxis([0 3]), axis ij </code></pre>  <p>The integer values always stay the same (i.e., Air = 0 , Water = 1, sediments = 2).</p>  <p>I've scoured the matplotlib documentation and stack, but haven't found a way to create this specific style colormap, which relates corresponding integers to a color. Most questions deal with diverging, jet, centering, linear, non-linear as opposed to a consistent coloring of specific colormaps. Each color <strong><em>must</em></strong> correspond to that <strong><em>specific</em></strong> integer value. </p>  <p>Any help will be appreciated, thank you in advance.</p>
