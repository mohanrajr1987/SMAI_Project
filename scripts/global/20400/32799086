<p>Is there an option to install scipy on windows without installing anaconda as well? I could not do it via pip and everywhere it is written to use anaconda.</p>  <p>More details: I want the scipy without any edition programs like Python(x, y) or Canopy. The problem with pip is: numpy.distutils.system_info.NotFoundError: no lapack/blas resources found, from research i found that i need to use additional program but it sound strange to me. I couldnt install lapack or blas.</p>
