<p>I have 64 bit windows 8.1, python 3.4. I have numpy and scipy installed, but I am encountering DLL errors, i.e.:</p>  <pre><code>File "C:\Python34\lib\site-packages\scipy\linalg\misc.py", line 5, in &lt;module&gt; from .blas import get_blas_funcs File "C:\Python34\lib\site-packages\scipy\linalg\blas.py", line 155, in &lt;module&gt; from scipy.linalg import _fblas ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found. </code></pre>  <p>I have looked through solutions like "<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/scipy/files/scipy/0.16.0b2/" rel="nofollow">scipy-0.16.0-win32-superpack-python3.4.exe</a>" but there is nothing on the page for 64 bit systems.</p>  <p>I can't find a stack for 64 bit windows (and I don't want to use winpython, Anaconda or other distributions of python. I am hoping to find something that will work with my standard python distribution). Is there a package or stack somewhere that I can install, without having to hunt down DLLs one at a time? I'm a newbie here, appreciate any help I can get. Thanks in advance!</p>
