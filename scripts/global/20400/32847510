<p>I'm trying to use Python like one would do in Matlab.  Basically I have some Python code for which I have run and it has generated some global variables.  Say,  a = 5 b = 3</p>  <p>I would like to save these to a .mat file , that will be openable by Matlab.  The goal is to be able to see the global variables in Matlab, just as one would when saving to a .mat file in Matlab. </p>  <p>I've seen examples where savemat is used to save dictionaries/arrays, but not where it saves the global variables. </p>  <p>How may I do so? Is this something that scipy just cannot do? </p>  <p>Thanks. </p>
