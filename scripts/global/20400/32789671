<p>It's my first time using the <a href="https://semaphoreci.com/" rel="nofollow">build system Semaphore</a>, and I'm having trouble installing scipy while doing my build.</p>  <p>Specifically, it's complaining that BLAS and LAPACK are not installed. Unlike <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7496547/does-python-scipy-need-blas">these answers</a> suggests, I can't compile any of the fortran files because Semaphore CI doesn't have them installed on their machines (nor can I install them, because they require root).</p>  <p>What is the proper way of installing scipy in this situation?</p>  <p>(If someone has a suggestion of where to place this question on stackexchange, that would also be appreciated. I'm not sure if this question belongs here.)</p>  <p>It seems <a href="https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/2890" rel="nofollow">travis-ci</a> had a similar issue. Except they resolved it by pre-installing scipy.</p>
