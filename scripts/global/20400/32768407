<p>A simple horizontal/vertical Laplace mask has 4 in the center of the kernel (left side of the figure).  Similarly, a Laplace mask sensitive to diagonal features has 8 in the center of the kernel (right side in the figure bellow). What mask is <code>scipy</code> using, and can I choose which one to use?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/2Jx5t.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/2Jx5t.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
