<p>I have 974 data points located on the surface of the unit sphere. The points are not ordered in any particular way. I wish to read in these data points, along with their corresponding polar coordinates (phi, theta). I then wish to interpolate onto a regular latitude-longitude grid using <a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-dev/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.SmoothSphereBivariateSpline.html" rel="nofollow">scipy.interpolate.SmoothSphereBivariateSpline</a>. So far I have the following code: </p>  <pre><code>import numpy as np from scipy.interpolate import SmoothSphereBivariateSpline  #Read in the unorganized grid points # and also shift so that phi in [0,pi] and theta in [0,2*pi) leb = np.genfromtxt('grid.txt') u, v = np.hsplit(leb, 2) phi, theta = u[:,0], v[:,0] theta += np.pi  #Read in the unorganized data values data1 = np.genfromtxt('0p0_97p03.txt')  #Create the interpolator object lut = SmoothSphereBivariateSpline(phi, theta, data1, s=350)  #Generate a regular lat-long grid to interpolate onto N = 100 lat = np.linspace(0.0, np.pi, N) lon = np.linspace(0.0, 2.0*np.pi, N) lat, lon = np.meshgrid(lat, lon)  #Now interpolate onto the regular grid data_inerp = lut(lat, lon)  </code></pre>  <p>In the above code, the arrays phi, theta and data1 are the unorganized data points, with each of these three arrays having a shape (974,). When i run this code I get the error message:  Traceback (most recent call last):</p>  <pre><code>  File "spherebiv.py", line 25, in &lt;module&gt;     data_inerp = lut(lat, lon)   File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/scipy/interpolate/fitpack2.py", line 958, in __call__     raise ValueError("Error code returned by bispev: %s" % ier) ValueError: Error code returned by bispev: 10 </code></pre>  <p>Now I don't understand this error code - it seems to be something to do with the underlying Fortran routine. Is there anything obvious I'm doing wrong here? </p>
