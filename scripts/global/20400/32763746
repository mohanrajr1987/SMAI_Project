<p>My script goes something like this:</p>  <pre><code>from scipy import misc pic = misc.imread(path_to_image) </code></pre>  <p>It works on my Windows machine but not when I run it on a linux machine. I get the error <code>AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'imread'</code>. </p>  <p>Reading some other similar questions, I have confirmed that scipy is is installed, and so is Pillow. I'm running a virtualenv with python 3.3.2, and have run other scripts successfully there.</p>
