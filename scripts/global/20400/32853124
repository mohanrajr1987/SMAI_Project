<p>So I am trying to create an array and then access the columns by name. So I came up with something like this:</p>  <pre><code>import numpy as np data = np.ndarray(shape=(3,1000),                   dtype=[('x',np.float64),                   ('y',np.float64),                   ('z',np.float64)]) </code></pre>  <p>I am confused as to why </p>  <pre><code>data.shape  </code></pre>  <p>and <code>data['x'].shape</code></p>  <p>both come back as (3,1000), this is causing me issues when I'm trying to populate my data fields</p>  <pre><code>data['x'] = xvalues </code></pre>  <p>where xvalues has a shape of (1000,).  Is there a better way to do this?</p>
