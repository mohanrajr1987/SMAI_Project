<p>I have a filter . They are supposed to have the same structure but they are scaled differently and the data from the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3HWMYm2lTkVMjBSMldKeUEyUUk/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">top filter</a> shown in the plot is truncated before 10000. I just set the value equal to zero at 10000 but I would like to extrapolated the top filter in order to follow the structure of the <a href="/vol/aibn84/data4/zahra/photo-z/bpz-1.99.3/FILTER/WFI_I.res">bottom filter</a>. The data related to each filter is provided in the links. I don't know how I can obtain the tail structure from the data in the bottom filter and apply it to the top one considering they have been scaled differently. Note that I need to use the upper panel filter because my other filters are calibrated accordingly. <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/uzvGQ.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/uzvGQ.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I can obtain the interpolation for the lower filter using <code>interp1d</code>, but I don't know how I should rescale it properly that can be used for the top filter.</p>  <pre><code>from scipy.interpolate import interp1d from scipy import arange import numpy as np u=np.loadtxt('WFI_I.res') f=interp1d(u[:,0], u[:,1]) x=arange(7050, 12000) y=f(x) </code></pre>  <p>I will be grateful for any suggestion or code to do that.</p>
