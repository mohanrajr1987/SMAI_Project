<p>I want to use a High-pass Filter on my Image(see appendix). The High-pass Filter should remove the Gradient of the Line in the Image. My Goal is to get a line nearly without the Gradient. </p>  <p>i tried different Methods: 1. I use a Gaussian Filter on the Image and subtract the result from the Original Image like:</p>  <pre><code>lowpass = ndimage.gaussian_filter(Image, 3) gauss_highpass = Image - lowpass </code></pre>  <ol start="2"> <li>I saved the Value of the Y-Coordinate of the Image in a Array and used the High-pass filter.  Unfortunately i dont get the result i want....</li> </ol>  <p>Image:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/xJMwB.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/xJMwB.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
