<p>I have 32 bit grayscale image data saved in tif files. It stems from background corrected CCD data so the values can also be negative.</p>  <p>Working in Python, scipy.misc.imread can load the file with no problems. With opencv however, I didn't manage to get the correct data, it loads all values as NaN, no matter what options I pass imread.</p>  <p>My main code is in C++, so I cannot use SciPy and have so far been happy with OpenCV but here it fails me.</p>  <p>Any suggestions?</p>
