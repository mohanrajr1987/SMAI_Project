<p>I have created an iPhone app using SceneKit. It works as expected on iphone. I also tried to run that same app on an iPad, but the app crashes right before <code>viewDidAppear</code> is called-<code>viewWillAppear</code> is called successfully. The error is <strong>EXC_BAD_ACCESS</strong> and it is shown in the <code>appDelegate</code>. I am little confused why this is happening. Have you guys ever encountered a similar problem?</p>  <p>EDIT: It works on ipad simulator, but not on a device.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/GhxUY.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/GhxUY.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
