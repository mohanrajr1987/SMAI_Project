<p>My app was working great until running it on iOS 9.</p>  <p>In the AppDelegate, I check whether the user is logged in or not. If they're not logged in, I send them to the login screen with the following line:</p>  <pre><code>self.window.rootViewController = [self.window.rootViewController.storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@"Login"]; </code></pre>  <p>After the user logs in, I attempt to send them to the main app with the following line:</p>  <pre><code>self.window.rootViewController = [self.window.rootViewController.storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@"Tabs"]; </code></pre>  <p>This worked in iOS 8, but now it crashes the app. And it's a bad crash. The whole device has to reboot (although it's a very quick one, so I think it's more like a SpringBoard reboot or something).</p>  <p>I'm seriously at a loss as to why the first line works and the second doesn't. Any help is much appreciated!</p>
