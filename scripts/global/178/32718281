<p>I am developing an android app based on ocr tech. I have implemented a button which ocr the image and generate the text. But, whenever I click on the button(both in emulator and real device) the app crashes and prompt as "Unfortunately, the app has stopped working". The function of the button is to find the training file from given path and process the image accordingly. So, can anyone tell me the solution for that. Thanks for your time. </p>
