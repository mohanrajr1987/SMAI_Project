<p>I just downloaded El Capitan today and when I try to add a new view controller to my project, xCode crashes and I am unable to add any view controller to my project with I need. Is this happening to anybody else or does anybody have a fix for this? I have reinstalled xCode 6.4 multiple times and I do not want to use xCode 7 as I do not want to use Swift 2 just yet.</p>
