<p>I'm trying to debug crashes that happen on the iOS device and simulator.  My app is built with the current version of Unity, 5.2.1f1.  Here's a crash that occurs in the 7.1 simulator whenever I rotate the device:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/E8X2G.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/E8X2G.png" alt="Screen shot of crash in XCode"></a></p>  <p>The crash is a EXC_BAD_ACCESS that happens while Unity code is attempting to call willRotateToInterfaceOrientation:duration.  None of my code is at all involved in this thread, as far as I can tell.</p>  <p>So you'd think this would affect everyone who tries to run on iOS (perhaps only on iOS 7.1?).  But my google-fu hasn't turned up any other questions about it.</p>  <p>Any idea what is causing this, and what I can do to fix it?</p>
