<p>I am working on a maintenance project. It has lot of different type crashes. I am frustrated to solve it. To solve just one crash it takes lot of time. So please let me know  What is the easiest and fast way to find the cause of crash in Project ? I want to get exact line by which crash occurred. So I set exception break point, symbolic break point and crashlytics (does not show proper crash reason), but Xcode does not give any information to me.It just go to main.m class and highlight main class. <strong>Any suggestion will be great. Thanks in advance !!</strong>   </p>
