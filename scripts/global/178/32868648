<p>So, I am developing a Web Service, and at some point, my Visual Studio 2015 started to crash every time i right click project -> Publish. When I publish a project it gets deployed to Azure.</p>  <p>I use git, so I undid all the changes to my last successful project publish, and yes, I did publish after that build before.</p>  <p>I tried to removed/install Visual Studio, and nothing worked. </p>  <p>Last thing I did was reset Windows 10 to factory settings and install everything again. This still does not do anything.</p>  <p>Last thing I could do is Wipe my computer completely and install everything again, but I don't really want to resort to that!</p>  <p>I am desperate with this! I have resharper 9.2 installed and Xamarin.</p>  <p>Thank you,</p>
