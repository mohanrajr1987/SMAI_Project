<p>The application began to crash when installing on iOS 9.1 Beta 2. <strong>Exactly  same binary (downloaded from hudson link)</strong> behaves so:</p>  <ul> <li>It did not crash on iOS 9.0 and iOS 9.0.1</li> <li>It did not crash on either iOS 8</li> </ul>  <p>I have extracted the crash log, crash happens inside the call to <code>[[NSBundle mainBundle] loadNibNamed:@"NameOfView" owner:self options:nil];</code>. The crash itself is <code>NSUnknownKeyException</code>: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>*** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSUnknownKeyException', reason: '[&lt; NameOfView: 0x1446a6ea0> setValue:forUndefinedKey:]: this class is not key value coding-compliant for the key .'</p> </blockquote>  <p>So far i see weird key <code>'.'</code> which nib loading mechanism tries to set on my class, and obviously, such is not present in nib. And this looks extraweird even more, due to iOS 9.1 beta 2 is the only version with this behaviour. Moreover, building app with XCode 7 from on same git revision gives no success crashing app - it works as expected. Has anybody experienced such behaviour after trying your release versions on iOS 9.0.1 beta 2? Want to have some feedbacks of SO community before file a bug to radar. Appreciate your help, guys.</p>  <p><strong>P.S. I'd like to emphasize that the issue reproduces only on that particular binary. Building it again from the same sources in XCode 7 doesn't produce a crash. So please, don't suggest how to debug such kind of problem, how to set exception breakpoint etc.</strong></p>
