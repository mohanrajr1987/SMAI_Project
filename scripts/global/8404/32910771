<p>What I want is fairly simple, and I have two examples for it:</p>  <p><a href="http://janvanderkleijn.nl/" rel="nofollow">http://janvanderkleijn.nl/</a></p>  <p><a href="http://studio-laucke-siebein.com/" rel="nofollow">http://studio-laucke-siebein.com/</a></p>  <p>When looking at these portfolio websites you see it's scroll based websites mainly relying on images. The interactivity I'm looking for is the clicking on an image, resulting in a 'hovering' element over the web page, further elaborating the project with text, images etc. What I like about it is that you don't have to leave the home-page to look into a project, and it can be closed by either pressing the close button in the top right, or clicked anywhere outside of this element. Especially in Laucke-Sibein's webpage it's nice, that when you scroll far enough down, the element dissappears.</p>  <p>How hard is it to achieve a similar result? How does this function work? I've been looking all afternoon and failed to find something that helped me further.</p>
