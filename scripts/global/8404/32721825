<p>I'm trying to run a function that activates whenever anywhere on the webpage is clicked.</p>  <p>In order to achieve this I created a div that fills the full webpage and I set an onclick command, but there's no response when clicking the div.</p>  <p>The exact same function works when I use it in an 'onclick' on a button, so what am I doing wrong?</p>  <p><code>&lt;div id='target' onclick="getStatus()"&gt; &lt;button onclick="getStatus()"&gt;Start&lt;/button&gt;</code></p>  <p>Thanks in Advance.</p>
