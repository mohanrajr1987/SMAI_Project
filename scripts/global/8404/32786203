<p>I am currently developing some automation tool. Now I am facing issue, which I do not know, how to handle. I am listening on click event and gathering information about event.target, like tagName, all atributes, htmlPath from the root etc. My problem is that it works well, unless I click on some button/link which is causing navigation, in that case my algorithm do not make it to gather all information and as a result nothing is saved. </p>  <p>What I can do about this? Is there way to postpone actual click, if I am listening on click event ? Any other ideas ?  </p>
