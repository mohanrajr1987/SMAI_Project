<p>When I click the space outside the <code>PopupWindow</code>, the window is dismissed. However, if I want to scroll a <code>ListView</code> outside the window, the scroll event is first recognized as a click event, and get intercepted by the window, so the window get dismissed, while the scroll is not executed.  </p>  <p>How can I scroll the <code>ListView</code> <strong>at the same time the window get dismissed</strong>, so that i don't need to scroll it again.</p>
