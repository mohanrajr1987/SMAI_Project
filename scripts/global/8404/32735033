<p>I'm getting confused with this. I have a RelativeLayout with 2 child, LinearLayout and ImageView.</p>  <p>in this case, the ImageView would be in front of the LinearLayout. Then the imageview is added with onclicklistener.</p>  <p>Problem is that OnClickListener become not functioning. doesn't detect any clicking event at all.</p>  <p>Then tried to change from OnClickListener to clickable:true and onClick:method. Clicking event is detected but is unable to find Specified method.</p>  <p>Anyone had any idea?</p>
