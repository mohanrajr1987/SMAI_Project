<p>I was trying to add an add new option to the select2.The select2 is populated from values passed from the controller.On selecting the add new link , a modal should appear.I researched a lot of options here in stack overflow. None seems to be working for me.Can anyone help ? <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15636302/attach-click-event-to-element-in-select2-result/15637696#15637696">one of the resources</a> </p>
