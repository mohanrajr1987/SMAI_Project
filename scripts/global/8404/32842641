<p>So I have an Android App made of WebView of my website which has Popup, Tabup &amp; Popunder Ads from <a href="http://goo.gl/2MLBnN" rel="nofollow">PopCash</a> in it. In normal browser when users click on any link the first click opens a new tab and display some advertisement by redirecting to the advertiser's website but in the Android app it just displays a blank white page. Is there any way to show the ads in a dialogue box in the app which can either be clicked or dismissed like one in the image below? <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/1j5bm.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/1j5bm.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
