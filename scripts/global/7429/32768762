<p>So I have a couple of search helper methods in C# which uses SOLR as the search engine. These methods return list of pages / suggestions from Sitecore. Everything works great in the local environment . But when the same is deployed to QA, This error appears in all pages where the search helpers are used. </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/EvIhd.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/EvIhd.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Here is the sample search method which returns a list of pages </p>  <pre class="lang-cs prettyprint-override"><code>var practicePages = SearchHelper.GetItems(GlobalHelper.GetContextIndex(), Sitecore.Context.Language.ToString(),                     IPractice_DetailConstants.TemplateIdString, ItemTree.Content.CGSH.Home.Practice_Landing.ItemID.ToString(), search)                     .Where(x =&gt; x != null)                     .ToList(); </code></pre>  <p>I am not sure how it is working in my local environment and not working in QA.  Does this have anything to do with the SOLR setup ?  I have also tried rebuilding indexes which did not solve this problem. </p>
