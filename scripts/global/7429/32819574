<p>is it possible to add an existing sublayout (ascx) to a sitecore mvc placeholder in the pageeditor? If I add it, nothing happens but there is no error at all.</p>  <p>What does work is the following in my view:</p>  <pre><code>     @{ Html.RenderPartial("Dummy.ascx");} </code></pre>  <p>Sitecore will render that sublayout, but if the ascx file has another sublayout nested, it will not get rendered.</p>  <p>Dummy.ascx:</p>  <pre><code>      &lt;sc:Sublayout Path="AnotherSublayout.ascx" runat="server" /&gt; </code></pre>  <p>AnotherSublayout is not visible at all.</p>
