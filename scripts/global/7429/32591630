<p>I am using Sitecore 7.2 with Web Forms for Marketers 2.4. Using wffm form designer I created a form that has a droplist in it. I want to be able to hide or unhide another field in the same form based on the selected value of the droplist. Through my research I came up with exporting the form (via form designer export) and pointing the sublayout to that exported form. I then added and onChange event to the droplist.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;cc3:droplist runat="server" title="Country" emptychoice="True" id="field_xyz" cssclass="scfDropListBorder fieldid.%7bxyz%7d name.Country" controlname="Country" fieldid="{xyz}" enableviewstate="False" onchange="checkField()"&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I then added a javascript to the bottom of the page.</p>  <p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false"> <div class="snippet-code"> <pre class="snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>function checkField() {   alert("Hello! I am an alert box!!");   var a = document.getElementById("field_xyz");   alert(a.options[a.selectedIndex].value);   var cityTextBox = document.getElementById("field_abc").parentNode.parentNode;   if (a == "United States") {     cityTextBox.style.display = "block";   } else {     cityTextBox.style.display = "none";   }   alert("Ending Script"); }</code></pre> </div> </div> </p>  <p>I can get the 'Hello!' alert to show every time but not the 'ending' alert and the value of 'a' is always null from what I can tell.</p>  <p>Is what I'm trying to do even possible in Sitecore?</p>  <p>I read something else that said they had a problem because of encapsulation and protection levels. I can also confirm that when I submit the form it does show up in the WFFM reports so I know it is submitting properly.</p>  <p>Any help/advice/direction would be appreciated.</p>
