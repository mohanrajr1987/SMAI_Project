<p>I'm trying to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32845461/can-i-still-access-a-sitecore-contact-facet-once-session-is-flushed">figure out an issue I'm having with sitecore</a>. I'm wondering if my issue is basically a problem with their <a href="http://www.sitecore.net/learn/blogs/technical-blogs/getting-to-know-sitecore/posts/2014/09/introducing-contact-facets.aspx" rel="nofollow">reliance on <code>Session.Abandon()</code></a>:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>For performance reasons Sitecore only writes contact data to xDB <em>(this is mongo)</em> when   the session ends.</p> </blockquote>  <p>This logic seems somewhat flawed (unless I misunderstand how sessions are managed in Asp.Net). </p>  <ul> <li>At what point (without explicitly calling <code>Session.Abandon()</code>) is the session flushed in this model? i.e. When will the <code>session_end</code> event be triggered?</li> <li>Can you guarantee that the logic will always be called or can sessions be terminated without triggering an <code>Abandon</code> event? for example when the app_pool is recycled.</li> </ul>  <p>I'm trying to figure this out as it would explain something that I'm experiencing, where the data is fine in session but is written intermittently into the mongoDb </p>
