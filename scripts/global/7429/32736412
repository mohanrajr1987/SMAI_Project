<p>In sitecore: </p>  <p>If a user is logged in with user name "<code>Addemo</code>", How Can I get the User profile item which is under <code>/sitecore/content/Intranet/User Profiles/A/Ad/addemo</code>.</p>  <p>I tried with  <code>User.Current.Profile.ProfileItemId;</code> But the ID I get with this is not the item Id of <code>addemo</code> (<strong>/User Profiles/A/Ad/addemo</strong>).</p>
