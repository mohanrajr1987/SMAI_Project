<p>I have a Sitecore 8 instance running. I created an editor role and assigned it to some users. In the Access Viewer and Security Editor I enabled the Language Read and Write on the items under System/Languages for the editor role and sitecore/everyone.</p>  <p>However, on an item in the content editor, the user still cannot change the language version of a content item. The dropdown on the right side when an item is clicked. It's there, but it's not functional.</p>  <p>What am I missing?</p>  <p>EDIT: I just realized that the same problems happens to the sitecore/admin user. Now I'm confused.</p>  <p>EDIT 2: It's a multisite and I just found out, that the drop down works when I log in using one of the other hostnames. Strange.</p>
