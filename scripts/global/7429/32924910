<p>I'm trying to overwrite the <code>SuccesRedirect</code> class from the WFFM module. I've found multiple blogs/websites saying how to do this ( like <a href="https://adesev.wordpress.com/2014/08/07/wffm-success-redirect/" rel="nofollow">https://adesev.wordpress.com/2014/08/07/wffm-success-redirect/</a> )</p>  <p>But this doesn't work for me. I'm creating an MVC website, maybe this is the issue ?  As there is a <code>Sitecore.forms.config</code> file and a <code>Sitecore.forms.MVC.config</code> file. But I can't seem to find any documentation about this.</p>  <p>Does anyone know how to achieve this or where i can find some more information about this ?</p>  <p>Edit: </p>  <p>I'm using <strong>WFFM Version 8.0 rev. 141217</strong>.</p>  <p>What i've done is i've followed the blog i've listed above:</p>  <p>Changed Sitecore.forms.config file: Changed the succesAction node with this:</p>  <pre class="lang-xml prettyprint-override"><code>  &lt;successAction&gt;     &lt;processor type="be.absi.kbs.extensions.SuccesRedirectWFFM, be.absi.kbs.extensions" /&gt;     &lt;processor type="Sitecore.Form.Core.Pipelines.FormSubmit.FormatSuccessMessage, Sitecore.Forms.Core" /&gt;   &lt;/successAction&gt; </code></pre>  <p>And i've created a class as follows: ( the assembly name is " be.absi.kbs.extensions " )</p>  <pre class="lang-cs prettyprint-override"><code>namespace be.absi.kbs.extensions {     class SuccesRedirectWFFM : ClientPipelineArgs     {         public void Process(SubmitSuccessArgs args)         { </code></pre>  <p>And what I'm trying to do is:</p>  <p>If the url has a returnUrl parameter, it needs to redirect to this url. for example <code>myWebsite/Login?returnUrl=/Blogs</code> Needs to redirect to user to the blog section after a successful login.</p>  <p>But so far i can't reach the Process method.</p>
