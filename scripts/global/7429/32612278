<p>I have seen how we can provide default conditions and default actions to newly created bucket items. I also know that we can create a custom rule for building path based on custom date field. </p>  <p>But, how can we set the item path when the date field is and the is saved. Consider an example. We have a bucket item template say "News" which has a date field say "Release Date". We have the settings where on item creation, the item path has the creation date like "/News/2015/09/16/item1". Now, we need to have some logic where we can change the path when the "release date" of "item1" is updated and the item is <strong>Saved</strong>.</p>  <p>How can we update the item path when item's release date is updated and item is Saved !! do i need to implement some logic in OnItemSaved() method ?</p>  <p>I already went through posts on <a href="http://www.geekhive.com/buzz/post/2015/4/how-to-create-custom-item-bucket-rules-in-sitecore-cms" rel="nofollow">GeekHive</a></p>
