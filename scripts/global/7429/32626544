<p>Is there some trick with placeholders in Sitecore MVC to ensure that they are always selectable in the <strike>page editor</strike> experience editor even when they don't contain any renderings? My controller rendering declares the placeholder in the cshtml view as follows:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div&gt;   &lt;!-- some html markup and fields rendered here --&gt;    @Html.Sitecore().Placeholder("my-component-placeholder") &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>
