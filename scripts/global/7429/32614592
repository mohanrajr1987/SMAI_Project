<p>We have a Sitecore site that's using Glass.Mapper. We also have a simple two step workflow, "Draft > Ready for publish" on all items. There are global items, which are promos that can be placed on pages. Authors create promos, then create pages and place the promos on the pages.</p>  <p>If a page is published but a promo hasn't been published, the page returns this error: Constructor on type 'OurSite.Sitecore.Models.IPromo' not found.</p>  <p>Since the scenario of authors failing to publish new promos is a real one, I would like to prevent this error from happening, so that the page just renders without the promo. Thoughts?</p>
