<p>I have really basic question about placeholder.</p>  <p>In placeholder item, I can see "Description" field. What is this for? I added dump text, but couldn't see any differences in page editor.</p>  <p>I also couldn't find any information regarding this "Description" field.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/FgovN.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/FgovN.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
