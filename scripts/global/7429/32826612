<p>In web.config publishing agent Job is running every 2 minutes. For one item I have added publishing restriction. I have added Publishing from date and time .But the item is getting deleted from web database till that time.</p>  <p>Is this the behavior of sitecore? </p>  <p>Also I tried creating a new version of item and added publishing restriction on that. And it was working as expected. i.e item is not deleted from web database and after specified time it is getting published. Is this solution proper?</p>
