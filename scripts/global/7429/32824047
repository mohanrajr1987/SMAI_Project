<p>Maybe I've just run out of my Google mojo, but I can't figure this out:</p>  <p>In Sitecore 8 user settings, I can set a "Start URL" per user - in other words the page/url, which the user gets directed to after login success. The interface for setting this value looks like this:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/owBiD.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/owBiD.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>If I click off <em>Desktop</em> and hit save, the value of the <em>StartUrl</em> field is set to <code>/sitecore/shell/default.aspx</code> and the user gets redirected to the classic "Lighthouse" desktop.</p>  <p>If I click off <em>Content Editor</em> and hit save, the value of the <em>StartUrl</em> field is set to <code>/sitecore/shell/applications/clientusesoswindows.aspx</code> and the user gets redirected to the content editor, effectively <code>/sitecore/shell/Applications/Content editor.aspx</code> (an extra redirect occurs).</p>  <p>If I click off <em>Default</em> and hit save, the value of the <em>StartUrl</em> field is set to the empty string, and the user gets redirected to the Launchpad thing, effectively <code>/sitecore/shell/sitecore/client/Applications/Launchpad.aspx</code>.</p>  <p><strong>My question is:</strong> How do I change the default behaviour, i.e. how do I decide where the user is redirected to, if he or she chooses <em>Default</em>? I want them to go to the Content Editor per default, they don't really fancy the Launchpad.</p>
