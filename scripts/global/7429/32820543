<p>I'm building a website using Sitecore 8 Update 2 ( rev 150223 ) and WFFM  ( rev 141217 ).</p>  <p>I've created a login form with the WFFM Module and this works pretty well. After a succesfull login the user is redirected to his/her profile page ( standard WFFM functionality ).</p>  <p>However this is not always what i want, sometimes people are asked to login before accessing some specific page or functionality. So when users login in now i want to redirect them back to the previous page.</p>  <p>I'm looking for a way that i can pass url in the url query that can be picked up  and used to redirect to that url instead of the standard return url.</p>  <p>For example: MyWebsite/Login?returnUrl=/HiddenSection/index</p>  <p>Does anyone know how i can achieve this or does anyone know an other solution that i could use ? ( I've found that you can override the succesredirect class, but this class doens't have direct access to the URL )</p>  <pre><code>public class SuccessRedirect : ClientPipelineArgs </code></pre>
