<p>After searching and reading a lot from Internet I manage create an Index using Lucene. My index name is: <code>my_text_index</code>. I have used Luke and I can see the index is created now with some data inside it (title of the items). </p>  <p>Now I have no idea at all how I can use this index to search using Sitecore API. </p>  <p>It would be very nice of you guys if you can write some steps for a beginner like me about "How to search from index in Sitecore".</p>  <p>Thanks!  </p>
