<p>By default smtp server can be configed in Sitecore web.config. However is it possible to hijack the whole email sending part to use a different method instead of a smtp server? Is there some kind of pipeline?</p>  <p>For example, I want to use another web service to send all emails, or I want to save all of them into a database instead of actually sending them?</p>  <p>Also a different question would be, does content delivery instance need to send emails by default? I would assume all out-of-box email sending are from content authoring instance right?</p>  <p>And from my understanding, there's only workflows in Sitecore need to send emails and it can be customized by changing the email action. (Assume no Email Campaign Modules, no Webform for Markets module and etc.)</p>  <p>Any insight would be great help, thanks!</p>  <p>--------------Update---------------------29/09/2015--------------</p>  <p>I have got my answers, thanks everyone.</p>  <p>Basically I shouldn't need to working about the smtp server on CDS instances, and all email sending can be controlled by pipelines on CAS instances.</p>  <p>However when I checked the source code, there's only one place "Reminder" which uses the smtp server to send emails directly. So if this function is important to you, you should consider update this function.</p>
