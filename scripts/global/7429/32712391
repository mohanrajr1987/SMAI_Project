<p>we have a Sitecore Project up and running, that is based on the regular aspx/ascx approach.</p>  <p>Over time we would like to transform our existing sublayouts to MVC.</p>  <p>For test purposes I am trying to add a very simple MVC text component to the project, still I am stuck somehow.</p>  <p>What I have done so far:</p>  <ul> <li>Installed MVC 5.2</li> <li>Installed WebPages</li> <li>Added references and bindings</li> <li>Added the MVC Scaffold</li> </ul>  <p>Right now, the Site does compile and run.</p>  <p>I have this Controller:</p>  <pre><code>    public class TextComponentController : Controller     {       public ActionResult Index()       {         return View();       }     } </code></pre>  <p>And my view:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;h2&gt;Index&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Hello from my View Template&lt;/p&gt; </code></pre>  <p>So absolutely nothing special here ;)</p>  <p>How can I create a sublayout (without a datasource) that just displays this simple MVC component?</p>
