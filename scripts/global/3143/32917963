<p>I'm having trouble iterating over a <code>ImmutableList</code> from Guava in Scala. The only reason I'm working with them is because I'm working with code written in Java that uses the Guava API. However, the compiler doesn't seem to like it. Here's my code:</p>  <pre><code>for (blockData: IBlockData &lt;- block.P.a) {   *insert actions here* } </code></pre>  <p>The compiler errors with this:</p>  <pre><code>Error:(24, 43) value filter is not a member of com.google.common.collect.ImmutableList[net.minecraft.server.v1_8_R3.IBlockData] for (blockData: IBlockData &lt;- block.P.a) {                       ^ </code></pre>  <p>Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks!</p>
