<p>I've looked for this in other answers but it seems that the symbol <code>$</code> trips the search engines up, and it's hard to look for "what is that <code>s</code> doing". I've tried putting <code>$</code> in quotes but I guess I'm doing something wrong.</p>  <p>Anyway, I have this method inside of a class:</p>  <pre><code>class Label(val name: String) {   override def toString = s"Label($name)" } </code></pre>  <p>And there's a lot of confusion here. </p>  <p>What is that <code>s</code> right before the quotation marks? From what I can understand, the class <code>Label</code> receives a String in its construction, so I'm not even sure why a <code>toString</code> method is necessary. </p>  <p>Seems pretty obvious that <code>$name</code> is the name variable that holds the <code>String</code> Label received, but why the <code>$</code>? I suspect that it has something to do with the variable being a field? Local vs global? But looking for this on google led me nowhere. Could someone please decipher this method?</p>
