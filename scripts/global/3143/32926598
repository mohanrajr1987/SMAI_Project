<p>If I had a List that looked like this:</p>  <pre><code>List("abdera.apache.org lists:", "commits", "dev", "user", "accumulo.apache.org lists:", "commits", "dev", "notifications", "user") </code></pre>  <p>And I wanted to end with a</p>  <pre><code>Map("abdera.apache.org lists:" -&gt; Seq("commits", "dev", "user"),  "accumulo.apache.org lists:" -&gt; Seq("commits", "dev", "notifications", "user")) </code></pre>  <p>How would I do that?</p>  <p>I've been trying groupBy, but I'm not sure how to apply a boolean to first get the key (i.e. string.contains("lists:")) and then a boolean to the next element to test if it doesn't contain "lists:" and therefore add it as a value.</p>
