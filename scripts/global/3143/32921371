<p>I'm trying to invoke a constructor that takes a varargs in Scala. The constructor is written in a Java class and takes two parameters, a <code>Block</code> and <code>IBlockState...</code>. The following code doesn't seem to compile, however:</p>  <pre><code>new BlockStateList(this, Seq[IBlockState[_ &lt;: Comparable[_]]](FACING, DAMAGE):_*) </code></pre>  <p>The compiler reports with this message:</p>  <pre><code>Error:(58, 66) type mismatch;  found   : Seq[net.minecraft.server.v1_8_R3.IBlockState[_ &lt;: Comparable[_]]]  required: Seq[net.minecraft.server.v1_8_R3.IBlockState[? &lt;: Comparable[?0]] forSome { type ?0 &lt;: Comparable[?0] }]    new BlockStateList(this, Seq[IBlockState[_ &lt;: Comparable[_]]](FACING, DAMAGE):_*)                                       ^ </code></pre>  <p>The required type doesn't seem syntactically correct to me, and I have no idea as to what it wants me to provide.</p>  <p>All help is greatly appreciated!</p>
