<p>I have an actor that is intended to do one long running job and not receive any more messages:</p>  <pre><code>    actor {        def receieve =&gt; longRunningJob()     } </code></pre>  <p>How can I debug the killing of this actor?</p>  <p>I have followed the documentation that says "Within an actor, you can stop a child actor by using the context reference:"</p>  <pre><code>    context.stop(childActor) </code></pre>  <p>I have also tried sending the child a Kill message, a Stop message, and a PoisonPill message, but nothing stops it while in the middle of the long running job.</p>
