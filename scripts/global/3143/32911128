<p>I was wondering what is the scope of a cached RDD. For example:</p>  <pre><code>// Cache an RDD. rdd.cache // Pass the RDD to a method of another class. otherClass.calculate(rdd) // This method performs various actions. // Pass the RDD to a method of the same class. calculate(rdd)            // This method also performs some actions. // Perform an action in the same method where the RDD was cached. rdd.count </code></pre>  <p>In the example above, will the RDD be materialized once? (It won't have to be recreated?) What is the scope of caching?</p>  <p>And should I always unpersist the RDD after I used it, if I don't need it anymore?</p>
