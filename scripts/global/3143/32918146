<p>How to nicely initialize structures like that:</p>  <pre><code>case class A(name: String, b: B) case class B(name: String, a: A) </code></pre>  <p>Looking for solution without lazy vals (performance overhead) and without adding new members to existing case class (it just looks ugly), but special wrappers and changes of original type-signature maybe fine (at least it's the best I've got for now). toString-problem is negligible as I can override it in some trait.</p>
