<p>I found a clever bit of code in the site I'm working on that uses hex values to store an array of toggleable variables. </p>  <p>(For example, D in hex being 1101 in binary, means the first toggle is one, the second is off, and the third and fourth are on). </p>  <p>I looked at unpack, but either I didn't understand it or it's not the right function for me. I also considered splitting the whole thing character by character and then sending each character through a switch that then drops values into an array, but that seems way too cumbersome and inelegant. </p>  <p>So, how do I turn a string of hex-based characters into an ordered array of Boolean values?</p>
