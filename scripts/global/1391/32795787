<p>I have a Python-script, which converts files to the hex string. Now I need to convert these strings to the pcap-file. The hex string after converting from png-file is about 174 pages of Word file. The code, which I use to make a string:</p>  <pre><code> filename = 'test.png'  with open(filename, 'rb') as f:  img = f.read()  print(binascii.hexlify(img)) </code></pre>  <p>So, is it even possible to do such converter?</p>
