<p>As a part of an assignment I'm working on, I'm trying to read hex values from a file using the following code steps:</p>  <pre><code>char buf[2048]; FILE *fp = fopen("/home/httpd/AS1/binary.bin", "r"); fgets(buf, 1024, fp); </code></pre>  <p>I created a binary file that has values like for example /xff/xff/xff .... etc</p>  <p>and every time I read the file using the provided code, the hex values (shellcode) get change into different numerical values</p>  <p>I also cannot modify to ready the values in a loop one at a time as I am supposed to use the code as is.</p>  <p>I tried creating the file containing the values in various ways:</p>  <pre><code>$ vi shcode.bin $ vi shcode </code></pre>  <p>I input the values into the file in various ways:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>/xff/xff/xff <br> "/xff/xff/xff" <br> ÿÿÿ</p> </blockquote>  <p>and every time I read the file, the values gets changed.</p>  <p>I spent countless hours trying to find  a solution with no result. Could you please help with what I'm doing wrong</p>
