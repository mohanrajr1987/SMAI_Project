<p>I am trying to refactor some piece of cgi-bin code to node js so i need little help about md5 hex translations. Assume that i have <strong>challange</strong> and <strong>uamsecret</strong> variables in my scope.</p>  <p>I expect to have same result in <strong>response</strong> object.</p>  <p>So far i think about using these two libraries combination but i feel like i am missing something.</p>  <p><a href="https://github.com/blueimp/JavaScript-MD5" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/blueimp/JavaScript-MD5</a></p>  <p><a href="https://github.com/rauls/nodejs-pack" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/rauls/nodejs-pack</a></p>  <pre><code>$hexchal  = pack "H*", $data{'challenge'}; $newchal = md5($hexchal, $uamsecret); $response = md5_hex("\0", $data{'password'}, $newchal); </code></pre>  <p>I will be appreciated for any help and guidance</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>  <p>Tolga.</p>
