<p>I got the following UUID values:</p>  <p><code>0x70, 0x29, 0x78, 0x89, 0x64, 0xc4, 0x47, 0x67, 0xa1, 0x9a, 0x4a, 0x9f, 0xe4, 0x2b, 0xf9, 0x05</code></p>  <p>This is the <strong>encoding function</strong> that the hardware developer has used:</p>  <pre><code>const UUID MY_SERVICE_UUID = createUuid({ 0x70, 0x29, 0x78, 0x89, 0x64, 0xc4, 0x47, 0x67, 0xa1, 0x9a, 0x4a, 0x9f, 0xe4, 0x2b, 0xf9, 0x05 }); </code></pre>  <p>I think this is expressed in hex. Is this correct? </p>  <p>I need to translate the above to a <code>NSString</code> in order to use it. Any help in doing so?</p>
