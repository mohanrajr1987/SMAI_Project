<p>I'm working on Texas NFC CHIP. my goal is to decode the Hex Number.</p>  <p>I just want to know how this series was generated, or I want suggestion how can I do crack it or understand the formula/algorithm with which they generated that hex. I used Android Application which how memory block of 4bytes and there are total 64byte Memory in That RFID Chip.</p>  <p>Also is Shows ACSI in  [..] Which is I think useless.  I have perform Xor and or Operations on Hex Numbers too but didn't get to any point yet.</p>  <p>There is UID Serial Number for that chip. I think they generating that hex Series against That UID.
