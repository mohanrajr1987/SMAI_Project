<p>Hey I need to decode hex and write to text file but I can only encode it not decode. I've written a script to encode which works and prints into text file called encoded.txt.</p>  <pre><code>import binascii with open('encoded.txt','r') as text:     a = text.readlines()     for x in a:         b = binascii.unhexlify(x)         with open('decoded.txt','a') as done:             done.write(b + "\n") </code></pre>  <p>So far I encoded (print " Hello World!") which returns 7072696e74202248656c6c6f20576f726c642122 but when i try to decode it it return an error stating that it was oddly length string. Could this be because i used "\n" in the encoder? Thankyou</p>
