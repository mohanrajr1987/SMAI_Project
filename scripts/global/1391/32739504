<p>I am a newbie into GPS application and i am stuck with one of the project. I want to read data (Lat / Long) from this GPS device (TK06A). For the time being i am using Hercules SETUP Utility bu HW-group. The data in text format is just garbage while if i convert it to HEX it appears as following</p>  <pre><code>{78}{78}{0D}{01}{03}{55}{48}{80}{00}{03}{53}{63}{00}{15}{2E}{44}{0D}{0A} {78}{78}{0D}{01}{03}{55}{48}{80}{00}{03}{53}{63}{00}{15}{2E}{44}{0D}{0A} {78}{78}{1F}{12}{0F}{09}{17}{11}{26}{06}{C8}{01}{FD}{4D}{C0}{07}{EC}{09} {E8}{00}{34}{71}{01}{94}{1B}{00}{BE}{00}{34}{E6}{00}{15}{35}{7C}{0D}{0A} </code></pre>  <p>While the HEX data makes certain sense as per the protocol, i am unable to understand the lat / long from this. This is the link to the protocol manual as given by the vendor</p>  <p><a href="http://www.getacoder.com/data/projects/164161/TK06A%20NEW%20device%20protocol%20reference-1.pdf" rel="nofollow">Link to Protocol Manual for GPS Tracker TK06A</a></p>  <p>I have also tried to write a JAVA code to read the TCP port and print the same but again it was of no help. </p>
