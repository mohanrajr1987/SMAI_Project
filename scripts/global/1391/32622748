<p>I'm trying to figure out how to most efficiently parse the following into Hex segments with c++ 98.</p>  <pre><code>//One lump, no delemiters char hexData[] = "50FFFEF080"; </code></pre>  <p>and want parse out 50 FF FE &amp; F080 (assuming I know hexData will be in this format every time) into base 10. Yielding something like:</p>  <pre><code>var1=80 var2=255 var3=254 var4=61568 </code></pre>
