<p>I have a hexdecimal no. string and I want to convert it into float. Can anyone suggest any idea? I searched here in this forum and i got one post mentioning the following solution. I understood that first string is converted to hex number and then hex no is converted to float. But I didn't understand how this <code>float_data = *((float*)&amp;hexvalue);</code> is taking place. And the code also does not work with this method too.</p>  <p><strong>Correction 1:</strong> I think i didn't mention clearly here. sorry for this. This hex value <code>39 39 2e 30 35</code> when converted to ascii, then it gives 99.05. And I need this ascii as float no. Following is my code:</p>  <pre><code>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; #include &lt;string.h&gt; #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; int main() {     char *my_data;     double float_data;     unsigned int hexvalue;     my_data = malloc (100);     my_data =strcpy(my_data, "39 39 2e 30 35");     sscanf (my_data, "%x", &amp;hexvalue);     float_data = *((float*)&amp;hexvalue);     printf ("the floating n. is %f", float_data);     free (my_data);     return 0; } </code></pre>
