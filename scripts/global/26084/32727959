<p>Initially I had this code working when I was just animating the one UIImageView that I had. But then I changed it to animate several dynamically created UIImageViews, however since they are dynamically created inside a for loop, I'm finding it difficult to animate them as I did the initial one.</p>  <pre><code>override func viewDidLoad() {     super.viewDidLoad()      var sprite: UIImage = UIImage(named: "sprites/areaLocatorSprite.png")!      var locations:NSArray = animal[eventData]["locations"] as NSArray      for var i = 0; i &lt; locations.count; i++ {          println(locations[i]["locationx"])         var locationx = locations[i]["locationx"] as String         var locationy = locations[i]["locationy"] as String          let x = NSNumberFormatter().numberFromString(locationx)         let y = NSNumberFormatter().numberFromString(locationy)         let cgfloatx = CGFloat(x!)         let cgfloaty = CGFloat(y!)          var mapSprite: UIImageView         mapSprite = UIImageView(image: sprite)          mapSprite.frame = CGRectMake(cgfloatx,cgfloaty,10,10)         townMap.addSubview(mapSprite)          timer = NSTimer.scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval(0.35, target: self, selector: Selector("flash"), userInfo: nil, repeats: true)      }  }  func flash() {     var mapSprite:UIImageView?      if mapSprite?.alpha == 1 {         mapSprite?.alpha = 0     } else {         mapSprite?.alpha = 1     } } </code></pre>  <p>This does not work as the mapSprite in the flash function is different to the one in the for loop. How can I refer to the one in the for loop and then animate it? Or would there be a better alternative to what I'm currently doing?</p>  <p>Many thanks!</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong> Using Xcode 6.2</p>
