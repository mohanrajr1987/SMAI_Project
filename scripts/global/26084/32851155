<p>I am currently working on an application which uses multiple UIImageViews to display images. I have set the width and height of the UIImageView to 25x25 on the interface builder. I also placed width and height constraints on the UIImageView so that it keeps that size during run time.</p>  <p>My question is, what size should the images be for 1x, 2x, and 3x in the assets?</p>  <p>For the images, I was originally using 25x25 for 1x, 50x50 for 2x, and 75x75 for 3x, but I feel this might be incorrect causing the images to look bad/blurry on other devices.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
