<p>I want to set a non-scrollable background to collection view. I was able to set the background image by adding a large image(created by manually tiling using Photoshop) as background pattern as follows: </p>  <pre><code>self.collectionView.backgroundView.layer.contents = (id)[UIImage imageNamed:@"largeImageUsingPattern"].CGImage; </code></pre>  <p>However, the image size was quite large. </p>  <p>If I set the backgroundColor with <code>colorWithPatternImage</code>, the background is scrollable. </p>  <pre><code>self.collectionView.backgroundColor = [[UIColor colorWithPatternImage:patternImage]]; </code></pre>  <p>How can I set the contents of CALayer using the small pattern and tile it? </p>
