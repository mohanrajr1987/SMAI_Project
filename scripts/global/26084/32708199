<p>Why does my Auto Constraints for distance from the sides have to be negative for the <code>UIImageView</code> to align with the sides of the <code>UIViewController</code>. In the screenshot below, notice that right side (aligned) is -20 and on the left side it is -14 and there is some empty space between the edges of the <code>UIImageView</code> and <code>UIViewController</code>.</p>  <p>Why is a negative number needed here?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/opVDs.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/opVDs.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
