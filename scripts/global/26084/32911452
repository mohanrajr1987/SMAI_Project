<p>I've got a set of UIImageViews contained inside of a UIScrollView. For some reason, when I go to have Voice Over read all the elements on the page, it does not read the ImageView like it should. I set up the UIImageView's accessibility info like so:</p>  <pre><code>if (self.featuresModel.imageText) {     self.featureImage.isAccessibilityElement = YES;     self.featureImage.accessibilityLabel = self.featuresModel.imageText; } </code></pre>  <p>I've checked that the UIScrollView is not set to be accessible, so it's not intercepting the touches. It seems to show it will work in the simulator, when I click on the image it pops up the correct label and highlights the correct area, however, on a physical device, clicking or trying to read all elements on the page does nothing when it gets to the UIImageView.</p>  <p>Any ideas on how to remedy this issue?</p>  <p>Edit: The scrollView class is a custom subclass of UIScrollView that doesn't implement UIAccessiblity protocol directly, however, since it uses a UIScrollView as its underlying data structure, I don't think this should matter much, however, as I still don't know much about UIAccessibility I thought I should mention it.</p>
