<p>I am trying to change the image of multiple UIImageView outlets across 3 different view controllers at the same time. I thought I might be able to do it by making the @IBOutlets for each UIImageView "global" but it won't let me do that. I then thought that I could change it through a prepareForSegue, but that only lets me change one. </p>  <p>Is there anyway I can change the image of these 3 UIImageViews at the same time?</p>
