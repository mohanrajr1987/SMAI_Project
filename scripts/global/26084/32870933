<p>I'm almost done zooming using auto layout completely from storyboard, the only problem is that my image does not center after zoom. The goal is to make picture zoom exactly with picture boundaries without black stripes.</p>  <p>Here is my constraints (it's basically standard ScrollView with imageView): <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/U105M.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/U105M.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>And here is what I done in order. Firstable I set <code>UIScrollViewDelegate</code> methods:</p>  <pre><code>-(UIView *)viewForZoomingInScrollView:(UIScrollView *)scrollView{     return self.fullScreenImageView; } </code></pre>  <p>And then after image download is complete i update the <strong>height</strong> constraint of my <code>UIImageView</code>:</p>  <pre><code>-(void)setupConstraintsToImageSize:(CGSize)imageSize {     [self.imageHConstraint setConstant:imageSize.height];     [self layoutIfNeeded]; } </code></pre>  <p>For an image constraints is like </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/NilBa.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/NilBa.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>So it's work like this (sorry 3MB GIF) :</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/tdp4L.gif" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/tdp4L.gif" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>So it's almost ALMOST works, but it's strangely goes to bottom, not center, how to center it?</p>  <p>I figure out i have to do sth with method <code>-(void)scrollViewDidZoom:(UIScrollView *)scrollView</code> But I'm really not sure what should I set there.</p>
