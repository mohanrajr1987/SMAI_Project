<p>Currently, I want to implement a color picker like this. The user should drag around the white view (the yellow circle should move with his/her finger) and select a color of his/her choice. So my question is: How can I move around the white view (having set it's anchor point where the grey circle is) by dragging it and meanwhile changing the middle size of the white image, without increasing/decreasing the circles' size.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/GW2B4.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/GW2B4.png" alt="enter image description here"></a> THANK YOU!</p>
