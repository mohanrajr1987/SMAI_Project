<p>So today I was experimenting with Collection Views and ran into quite an interesting bug. </p>  <p>The bug is that the imageView circles which I had are never perfect, unless I scroll them off the screen. Their shape resembles that of a rhombus with rounded edges. </p>  <p>And after I scroll up and down again so that the top cells become temporarily out of sight, the cells which were out of sight are now perfect circles.</p>  <p>Here is my code for the cell class:</p>  <pre><code>class FavouritesCollectionViewCell: UICollectionViewCell {     @IBOutlet weak var profilePicutreImageView: UIImageView!     @IBOutlet weak var nameLabel: UILabel!      override var bounds: CGRect {         didSet {             contentView.frame = bounds         }     }      override func layoutSubviews() {         profilePicutreImageView.layer.borderWidth = 2.0         profilePicutreImageView.layer.masksToBounds = false         profilePicutreImageView.layer.cornerRadius = profilePicutreImageView.frame.width/2         profilePicutreImageView.layer.borderColor = UIColor.blackColor().CGColor         profilePicutreImageView.clipsToBounds = true      } } </code></pre>  <p>Any ideas about what this may be? </p>  <p>UPDATE---Here are the pictures of what is happening</p>  <p>Before: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/osqNu.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/osqNu.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>After: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ensy3.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ensy3.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
