<p>I am trying to make a UIButton programatically on top right corner of UIImageView, so far I have an UIImageView and I want to create a UIButton on top right edge of the UIImageView whenever the image is loaded to the image view. I am not sure how could I achieve that. </p>  <pre><code>  UIButton *button = [UIButton buttonWithType:UIButtonTypeSystem];                         [button setTitle:@"X" forState:UIControlStateNormal];                         [button sizeToFit];                         button.center = CGPointMake(self.img1.frame.origin.x+self.img1.frame.size.width,self.img1.bounds.origin.y); </code></pre>  <p>[self.img1 addsubView : button];</p>  <p>Here , img1 is an image view. I want to add that button on top right of the img1.</p>  <p>How can I achieve that?</p>
