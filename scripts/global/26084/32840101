<p>I had the opportunity today to try the caching system of my application and it seems it does not work as expected ...</p>  <p>I am using the well-known setImageWithURL method to display images in every cells of a UITableView as follow:</p>  <pre><code>// reset cell image (to make sure reused cell starts fresh) [cell.profilePic setImage:nil]; // profilePic of user [cell.profilePic setImageWithUrl:[NSURL ...]]; </code></pre>  <p>The documentation says the following:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Asynchronously downloads an image from the specified URL, and sets it   once the request is finished. Any previous image request for the   receiver will be cancelled. If the image is cached locally, the image   is set immediately, otherwise the specified placeholder image will be   set immediately, and then the remote image will be set once the   request is finished. By default, URL requests have a Accept header   field value of “image / *”, a cache policy of NSURLCacheStorageAllowed   and a timeout interval of 30 seconds, and are set not handle cookies.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I turned off wifi on my iphone and re-scrolled the UITableView and everything disappears ... I would have expected everything to stay. Do I need to configure something for the cache? Or is AFNetworking supposed to handle everything by itself? I have nothing else than these two lines of code and did not do any configuration regarding caching system. It is all default.</p>
