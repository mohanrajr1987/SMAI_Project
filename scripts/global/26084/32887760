<p>I want to have a <code>UIImageView</code> in my app where I insert an image dynamically, but the image is bigger than the <code>UIImageView</code>.</p>  <p>I constrain the height to a constant value, but the width is left undecided, only defined by <code>ScaleAspectFit</code>, so the image fits completely inside.</p>  <p>Now I see that the width of the <code>UIImageView</code> is equal to the size of the original image, thus moving around other elements.</p>  <p>How can I make the width be exactly what it should be, so that the image scales nicely inside it?</p>  <p>Screenshot (superbad because inside view debugging):</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/2Bei2.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/2Bei2.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Constraints (I want to get rid of the <code>(content size)</code> one):</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/MCCkr.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/MCCkr.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
