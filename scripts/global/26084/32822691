<p>Today I have moved my project to XCode 7 from XCode 6. Before it was working perfect but now I ve some weird issues.</p>  <p>I am displaying image on UIImageView and that image is downloaded from web. Here is the code:</p>  <pre><code>dispatch_queue_t queue = dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_HIGH, 0ul); dispatch_async(queue, ^{     NSData *data = [NSData dataWithContentsOfURL:imageURL];     UIImage *image = [UIImage imageWithData:data];     dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{         [cell.imgTrainer setImage:image];         selectedTrainerImage = image;     }); }); </code></pre>  <p>I have checked <code>imageURL</code> and it is fine. </p>  <p>I am calling the page with <code>presentViewController</code> </p>  <pre><code>UIStoryboard* storyboard = [UIStoryboard storyboardWithName:@"Main" bundle:[NSBundle mainBundle]]; UIViewController* controller = [storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@"TrainerListView"];  self.animationController = [[ZoomAnimationController alloc] init];  controller.transitioningDelegate  = self; [self presentViewController:controller animated:YES completion:nil]; </code></pre>  <p>I dont understand what is the problem. I didn't touch even a line what was working on XCode 6.</p>
