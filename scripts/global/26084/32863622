<p>I have given constrains to UIImageView from xib. Now from code I can get all constrains of that image by code <code>imageview.constraints</code> . Now I want to change trailing , leading, top and bottom constrains constant values. I have loop through and my code is as below:</p>  <pre><code>for constrain in imageview.constraints {      if  constrain.firstAttribute == NSLayoutAttribute.Trailing     {         constrain.constant = hPadding     }     if constrain.firstAttribute == NSLayoutAttribute.Leading     {         constrain.constant = hPadding     }     if constrain.firstAttribute == NSLayoutAttribute.Top     {         constrain.constant = vPadding     }     if constrain.firstAttribute == NSLayoutAttribute.Bottom     {         constrain.constant = vPadding     } } </code></pre>  <p>But non of the conditions are excited. Please help me to solve issue. What I am missing?</p>
