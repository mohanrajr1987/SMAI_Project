<p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8SKRV.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8SKRV.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>The image is set on the imageView via a URL. When I do not set an image, the tablecell highlights just fine, but when the image is applied to it, it seems to become opaque, almost like the image has a higher z-index compared to the highlight view that the tablview is applying. Does this mean I will have to use a custom highlight? </p>
