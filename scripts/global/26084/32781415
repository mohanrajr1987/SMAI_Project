<p>Sorry if the question is a bit subjective, but I couldn't find anything about the topic.</p>  <p>The question is simple:</p>  <p>Which one of the following alternatives are "best", (i.e. best performance). I want to show the image in an UIImageView regardless of the chosen solution.</p>  <pre><code>self.imageView.image = [UIImage animatedImageNamed:@"imagename-" duration:2.0f]; </code></pre>  <p>or</p>  <pre><code>self.imageView.animationImages = listOfMyImageNames;  self.imageView.animationRepeatCount = 0; self.imageView.animationDuration = 2; [self.imageView startAnimating]; </code></pre>  <p>I know that the UIImageView-solution gives more flexibility with number of loops etc, but I want an infinite animation so that doesn't matter in this case.</p>
