<p>I am quite new to iOS app development so I could not find solution or keyword to search for my problem.</p>  <p>I have been working on an workout tracking app which has tableview of workout exercise lists. and users can select each tableview cell as "finished" workout or "unfinished" workout.  Im trying to make an image view where the image of body parts corresponds to the workout results. for example, if user finished chest workouts, the chest part of the body image gets colored to light green, and as user finishes more workouts, the coloring gets darker in green.</p>  <p>I have finished all other parts of the app but i don't know how to color specific part of an image. </p>  <p>Could anyone suggest me where to look? or the key word that I need to search for? </p>
