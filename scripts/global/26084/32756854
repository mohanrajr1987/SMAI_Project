<p>I found many tutorials that explain over scroll view which we used to display multiple images inside scroll view.But,when i tried to zoom,which make me stuck.So,I search the other one and i found scroll view which was implemented with <code>UICollectionView</code>--><code>MVCarouselCollectionView</code>.Its also complicated and have many steps to do to have perfect image sliding library also included full screen zoom feature.But,it have many errors also autolayout issue which i cant use it directly for rotating devices.</p>  <p>So,its there any other alternative 3rd party library like <code>MVCarouselCollectionView</code> which i can use easy in <code>Swift</code> with no autolayout issue?</p>  <p>Any help? I found these library at githud also many tutorial on raywanderish and appcoda,but they don't explain it completely.Some are work on sliding images inside scrollview but for zooming,its not.When i tried to apply "hamasyou" with zoom view,stuck with its library which mean not worked out.</p>  <p>These are the libraries i found on web </p>  <p><a href="https://github.com/bizz84/MVCarouselCollectionView" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/bizz84/MVCarouselCollectionView</a></p>  <p><a href="http://www.the-nerd.be/2015/06/22/tnimagesliderviewcontroller-image-slider-for-swift/" rel="nofollow">http://www.the-nerd.be/2015/06/22/tnimagesliderviewcontroller-image-slider-for-swift/</a></p>  <p><a href="https://github.com/hamasyou/autolayout" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/hamasyou/autolayout</a></p>  <p>Is there any way that i can do thing like "MVCarouselCollectionView" with no autolayout issue?Please,I really need help.I am stucking at this for a week.</p>  <p>I really need a good source to create image sliding with multiple images and zoom full screen feature.Thanks.</p>
