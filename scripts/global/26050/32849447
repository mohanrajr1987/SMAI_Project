<p>I just updated Xcode to 7.0.1 and therefore also Swift from Swift 1 to  Swift 2. </p>  <p>I got a lot of errors when the update was done and this is one of the problems I can not fix. It would be really nice if you could fix this for me.</p>  <p>The error message says: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Nil is not compatible with expected type UIViewAnimationOption'</p> </blockquote>  <pre><code>UIView.animateWithDuration(2, delay: 0, usingSpringWithDamping: 1, initialSpringVelocity: 6, options: nil, animations: ({  }), completion: nil) </code></pre>
