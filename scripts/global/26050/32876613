<p>Across my app I have several different subclasses of UIView: UIDatePicker, UIPicker, UIButton, UITableView, UITableViewCell, UITextView, etc. etc... For each of these I'd like to add a very simple drawRect custom implementation that I have working great.</p>  <p>Is there a simple way to get multiple subclasses of UIView to all have the same drawRect implementation without creating a subclass and repeating the same code across each UIPicker, UIButton, etc. etc... ?</p>  <p>I realize the solution to this is probably to write a delegate class for UIView's layer property and do the custom drawing in drawLayer, but I thought I would ask before I go re-working my code.</p>
