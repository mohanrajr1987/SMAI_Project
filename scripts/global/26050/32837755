<p>I have the following code:</p>  <pre><code>override func touchesMoved(touches: Set&lt;UITouch&gt;, withEvent event: UIEvent?) {     myView.frame.origin.x += 2 } </code></pre>  <p>The view in question is contained inside of another view which is moving as expected when it is modified. As such, I think that this nesting is the root of the problem. Is there a solution to this so that I can move the view "myView" in the way seen above?</p>
