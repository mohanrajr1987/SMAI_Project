<p>I have a UIView which I want to go up by its height, then come back to its position, then go down by its height and again come back to its position. I want this thing to repeat. </p>  <p>I am using <code>UIView.animateKeyframesWithDuration</code> for this. But the problem is after completing one round, it stops for sometime. Not sure why it is happening. Here is the code. I do not want any delay. I want it to keep repeating without any delay. What am I doing wrong?</p>  <pre><code>UIView.animateKeyframesWithDuration(1.0, delay: 0.0, options: UIViewKeyframeAnimationOptions.Repeat, animations: {         UIView.addKeyframeWithRelativeStartTime(0.0, relativeDuration: 0.25, animations: {             self.leftDot.center.y -= self.leftDot.frame.size.height         })         UIView.addKeyframeWithRelativeStartTime(0.25, relativeDuration: 0.25, animations: {             self.leftDot.center.y = self.vibrancyView.center.y         })         UIView.addKeyframeWithRelativeStartTime(0.5, relativeDuration: 0.25, animations: {             self.leftDot.center.y += self.leftDot.frame.size.height         })         UIView.addKeyframeWithRelativeStartTime(0.75, relativeDuration: 0.25, animations: {             self.leftDot.center.y = self.vibrancyView.center.y         })     }, completion: nil) </code></pre>
