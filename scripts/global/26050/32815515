<p>I'm having a h3ll of a time with AutoLayout. I've been using Reveal to look at various views of the app and see if anything is 'revealing' there.  Anyway, I have this weird view <strong><em>circled in red</em></strong> that's not in my nib, yet is somehow being added to my view hierarchy.  I don't find any code that's adding it either, so I'm somewhat mystified how it's getting there.</p>  <p>If you were going to investigate how this view is making its way into your heirarchy, what would you do?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/d2P16.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/d2P16.png" alt="MysteryView"></a></p>  <p>It looks like something is happening between -viewDidLoad completing, and -viewDidAppear, because this recursive description call I made at those points shows a view that gets resized to a ridiculous dimension (highlighted in yellow, look at the size change)</p>  <p>I also did a constraint debug call that listed all the constraints and their ambiguity status. I still can't figure out where the circled view is coming from though, or why it's being resized as it is.</p>  <p>Note also that even though the recursive constraint debug call says there's ambiguous layout, there is no indication of that in Interface Builder where I set up the constraints, so I suspect this extra view is sneaking in somehow during execution and screwing everything up.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/JYM4v.gif" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/JYM4v.gif" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
