<p>I'm trying to adjust the origin.y value of a UIView's frame.  The problem that I'm running into is that the elements aren't moving with the frame with negative offsets.  When I give the origin.y a positive value, it works perfectly: the view drops down, leaving black above, and the elements shift down as well.  With a negative value, on the other hand, the view moves correctly, leaving black below, but the elements don't change position.  I feel like the problem might be with autolayout, and the elements remaining trapped by the top of the screen, not the top of the UIView.</p>  <p>Any ideas on how to fix this?</p>
