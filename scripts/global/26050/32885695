<p>I would like to check which subview is visible right now on screen or covered by other view , which I cannot do with the following condition.</p>  <pre><code>if (viewController.isViewLoaded &amp;&amp; viewController.view.window) {   // viewController is visible } </code></pre>  <p>Could anyone give me example for a subview? </p>  <p>If viewController is the main controller where I add subviews, I like to check this condition for one of my subviews-child of this controller.</p>
