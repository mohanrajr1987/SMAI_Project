<p>I'm hoping someone may be able to help me understand why my animations on a tvOS app are not running. </p>  <p>In my code (truncated), I've set up a function like so:</p>  <pre><code>func testAnimation() {      clockLabel.alpha = 0.0      UIView.animateWithDuration(1.0, animations: {         self.clockLabel.alpha = 1.0     }) } </code></pre>  <p>I am calling <code>testAnimation()</code> from within my <code>viewDidLoad()</code>, but no animation ever seems to happen. </p>  <p>I've tested with a few different types of animation, from things like position to opacity, but it seems that no animation ever actually runs in the Simulator.  </p>  <p>At this time, my app does not have a <strong>focus</strong>, as all I'm trying to do is load a blank <code>UIView</code> with a label in the middle that fades in.</p>
