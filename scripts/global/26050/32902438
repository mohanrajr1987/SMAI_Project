<p>I'm new to Swift (coming over from PHP).  I'm a little lost as the behaviour of <code>UIView</code> seems to be a little inconsistent for me.</p>  <p>On my main screen I have an activity list, with each activity item contained in a UIView.  This interface is built on a UITableView with a custom prototype cell.</p>  <p>Tapping on an item causes a segue into a new view that should display the full article.  What I'm noticing however is that while my UIView's within the table cells seem to auto adjust their height to fit the length of the text content.  The UIView I'm using for my article background does not resize.</p>  <p>I've not set a fixed height for the UIView (although Xcode7 seems to want me to).  I've also confirmed that my label is in fact wrapping the text correctly, the UIView just simply doesn't grow and so it truncates the article.</p>  <p>My rough layout is:</p>  <p><strong>Working</strong>: UITableViewController -> CustomTableCell -> UIView -> Detail items</p>  <p><strong>Not working</strong>: UIViewController -> UIView -> Detail items</p>  <p>Any help would be appreciated.  I'm building this in storyboard mode.</p>  <p>I'm including a screenshot of the layouts.  The one on the left works perfectly, the one on the right however the UIView (white area) does not stretch veritcally.<a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/PWp7Q.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/PWp7Q.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
