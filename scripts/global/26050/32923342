<p>I'm trying to detect the point at which there are no more touches on screen. </p>  <p>I've tried keeping a running total of touches by counting in touchesbegan and touchesended - but, since I unavoidably have to deal with touches within both super and sub views, the behavior of when those methods are called doesn't make it possible (e.g. if a user touches and then slides off a subview and then back on to that same subview, touchesBegan is called when sliding on but touchesEnded is not called when sliding off).</p>  <p>Does anyone have a reliable method for detecting when there are no touches left on screen?</p>  <p>Many thanks!</p>  <p>D</p>
