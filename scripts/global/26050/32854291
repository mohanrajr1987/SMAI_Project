<p>I’ve attached a <code>UITapGestureRecognizer</code> to my <code>UIView</code> which works as expected, however, as part of my user interface the view gets rotated when tapped the first time. Now, the same tap gesture is no longer fired when I try to tap on the view.</p>  <p>The transform is attached to the view’s layer.</p>  <p>How do I detect a <code>UITapGestureRecognizer</code> on a view whose layer has a non <code>CATransform3DIdentity</code> transform?</p>
