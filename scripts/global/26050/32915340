<p>I'm trying to load a nib programmatically without using IBOutlets in storyboard. </p>  <p>I've set the file owner's custom class and created outlets for the images and labels. I've created an instance of UINib and called instantiateWithOwner in my custom class to manually load the nib. Now I'm trying to load the nib on an uitableviewcontroller.</p>  <p>There are several questions and tutorials for how load the nib using storyboard and IBOutlets, which is straightforward. </p>  <p>Can anyone tell me how to go about this programmatically, in swift?  </p>
