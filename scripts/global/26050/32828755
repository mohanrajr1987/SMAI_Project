<p>I'm trying to set up a view inside a container view. It has to be done this way due to several different controllers for the views inside the <code>swipeView</code>. </p>  <pre><code>@IBOutlet weak var containerView: ContainerView!  override func viewDidLoad() {     super.viewDidLoad()       //Some other stuff       //Create new swipeView      var swipeView = MDCSwipeToChooseView(frame: containerView.frame, options: options)      //Add the view from the controller to the swipeView     swipeView.addSubview(containerViewController.view)      //Add the swipeView to the main view     self.view.addSubview(swipeView) </code></pre>  <p>I end up with this</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZiOW7.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZiOW7.png" alt=""></a></p>  <p>The white area is the view that should inherit <code>containerView</code>'s size. The <code>containerView</code> is the pink one in the background and it's shown properly. I have noticed that <code>containerView.frame</code> returns the size of the component from the storyboard, see pic 2. The frame obtained by calling on the <code>containerView.frame</code> is the one before the view is resized to meet all constrains. How do i get the proper values?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/fllVC.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/fllVC.png" alt="pic 2"></a></p>
