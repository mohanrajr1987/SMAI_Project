<p>My app is crashing when transitioning some <code>UIViews</code>, and I'm not able to find the cause. I get this error in the logs console of Xcode:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>2015-09-23 10:03:43.420 My App[1510:528283] The view hierarchy is not prepared for the constraint: When added to a view, the constraint's items must be descendants of that view (or the view itself). This will crash if the constraint needs to be resolved before the view hierarchy is assembled. Break on -[UIView(UIConstraintBasedLayout) _viewHierarchyUnpreparedForConstraint:] to debug.</p>      <p>2015-09-23 10:03:43.421 My App[1510:528283] *** Assertion failure in -[UIView _layoutEngine_didAddLayoutConstraint:roundingAdjustment:mutuallyExclusiveConstraints:], /BuildRoot/Library/Caches/com.apple.xbs/Sources/UIKit/UIKit-3505.16/NSLayoutConstraint_UIKitAdditions.m:590</p> </blockquote>  <p>I don't know how to debug this, i don't understand that <code>Break on -[UIView(UIConstraintBasedLayout) _viewHierarchyUnpreparedForConstraint:] to debug.</code>. I didn't find how to do this in the documentation and any example, could somebody tell me how could I do?</p>
