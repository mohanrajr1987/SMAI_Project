<p>I've created a circle on the screen by creating a UIView at the finger's location when touchesBegan():</p>  <p><em>In ViewController:</em></p>  <pre><code>override func touchesBegan(touches: Set&lt;UITouch&gt;, withEvent event: UIEvent?) {      for touch in touches {          let pos = touch.locationInView(view)          let radius: CGFloat = touch.majorRadius * 2         let circleView = CircleView(frame: CGRectMake(pos.x - radius / 2, pos.y - radius / 2, radius, radius))         view.addSubview(circleView)      } } </code></pre>  <p><em>In CircleView:</em></p>  <pre><code>override init(frame: CGRect) {     super.init(frame: frame)      let recognizer = UIPanGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: Selector("handlePan:"))     recognizer.delegate = self     self.addGestureRecognizer(recognizer)  } </code></pre>  <p>This creates the circle, but does not move it immediately when I move my finger. Instead, I have to pick my finger up and place it back on the circle before handlePan() kicks in.</p>  <p>Is there a way to start tracking a pan gesture without lifting the finger that spawned it's parent view, taking into account there may be multiple fingers touching and moving around the screen?</p>
