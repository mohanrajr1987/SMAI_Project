<p>I'm trying to draw a gradient on the background view of a View Controller with iOS 9 but, I don't know why, isn't working</p>  <p>Here is my method, which is called from viewDidLoad</p>  <pre><code>- (void)drawGradient {   CAGradientLayer *gradient = [CAGradientLayer layer];   gradient.frame = self.view.bounds;    gradient.colors = @[[UIColor greenColor], [UIColor redColor]];   gradient.locations = @[@0.0, @1.0];    [self.view.layer insertSublayer:gradient atIndex:0]; } </code></pre>  <p>But nothing happens and gradient doesn't appear.  What i'm doing wrong?</p>
