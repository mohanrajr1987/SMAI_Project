<p>I would like to submit an add-on into FF AMO. My project includes some external libs and after uploading my xpi to the store I got the message that I need to fix the following issues to have the faster automated review and signing:</p>  <ul> <li>Markup should not be passed to <code>innerHTML</code> dynamically. </li> <li>Access to the <code>Function</code> global</li> </ul>  <p>It finds this issues for example inside the following files:</p>  <ul> <li>data/Pages/bower_components/jquery/src/core.js</li> <li>data/Pages/lib/underscore.js</li> </ul>  <p>What could I do to ignore files from review process?  Is there any options to do that?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
