<p>I'm trying to make my first addon in firefox, so i'm using jpm as recommended :</p>  <pre><code>var panel = panels.Panel({   contentURL: './view/downloads.html',   contentScriptFile: [     './../lib/vendor/jquery-1.11.3.min.js',     './contentScript.js'   ] }); </code></pre>  <p>As i understand there was before xul (xml + moz DTD stuff) that allowed to make "mozilla native" interfaces.</p>  <p>But how do i for example use some icons (for instance the download icon, or the host native generic icon for image, file etc) in my html? What are the possibilities to make my html panel look more native (even there are already some styles applied like gray background etc) ?</p>  <p>I could not find some more complete info on making interfaces on the mdn .</p>
