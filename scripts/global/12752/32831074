<p>I am authoring an add-on for Firefox that generates a panel when the user clicks the button in the add-on bar.</p>  <p>In Chrome, my popup renders the way that I want it to, but I can right-click on the popup and select "Inspect element" from the context menu to debug the rendering.</p>  <p>In Firefox, the panel is rendering strangely, but right-clicking on it doesn't give me a context menu. Selecting Debug from the add-on tab allows me to see the content scripts and set breakpoints, but no Inspector there either.</p>
