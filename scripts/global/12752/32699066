<p>Does Firefox provide an API for extensions to capture media key events on OS X? These are physically located on the F7/F8/F9 keys on Apple's keyboards, but they don't have keycodes, so it seems impossible to intercept a media key press event with an <code>onkeypress</code> event.</p>  <p>To clarify: I have tried multiple JS tools which detect keycodes on <code>onkeypress</code> events. I can say with 100% confidence that the OS X media keys do not send an <code>onkeypress</code> event on any popular in-browser JS implementation unless the <code>fn</code> key is held down at the same time, but that isn't what I'm asking about.</p>  <p>To my understanding, Chrome implements a separate API which allows for capturing media key press events. I am asking if Firefox provides a similar API.</p>
