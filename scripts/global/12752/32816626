<p>I am writing code that capture hotkey after user press <code>control</code>-button in preferences of addon - I want to change the <code>label</code> when user push the button and change again when user push some keys (to display the new hotkey). <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/High-Level_APIs/simple-prefs" rel="nofollow">Official documentation</a> about <code>simple-prefs</code> not mention that I can change something visual in loaded preferences view and in debug I looked into object <code>prefs</code> and saw that my preferences is just a strings - only the values and types.</p>
