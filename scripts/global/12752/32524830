<p>I am trying to build an add-on that will, at one point, open a link. However, my issue is that I can't find a method I can use to open a link in the same tab and in the same browser window. </p>  <p>I was looking at this link:</p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8454510/open-url-in-same-window-and-in-same-tab">Open URL in same window and in same tab</a></p>  <p>but when I tried what was suggested my add-on carried on opening the url in a new window and tab. I've been unable to find any documentation on this as well. Could someone point me in the right direction?</p>  <p>If it helps at all this is my code:</p>  <pre><code>var buttons = require('sdk/ui/button/action'); var windows = require("sdk/windows").browserWindows;  var button = buttons.ActionButton({     id: "access-link",     label: "Access eHOPortal",     icon: {         "16": "./panorama-16.png",         "32": "./panorama-32.png",         "64": "./panorama-64.png"     },     onClick: handleClick });  function handleClick(state) {     windows.open("myURL", "_self"); } </code></pre>
