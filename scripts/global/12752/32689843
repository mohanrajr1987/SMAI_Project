<p>I have developed my add-on in scratchpad environment and now developing is finished and I want to create final xpi file.</p>  <p>I replace only this:</p>  <pre><code>Cu.import('resource://gre/modules/ctypes.jsm'); </code></pre>  <p>by this:</p>  <pre><code>var {Cu} = require("chrome"); var{ctypes} = Cu.import("resource://gre/modules/ctypes.jsm", null); </code></pre>  <p>Then using nodejs (jpm init and jpm xpi commands) I created xpi file however this is not worked properly.</p>
