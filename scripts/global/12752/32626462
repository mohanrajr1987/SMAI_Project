<p>I'm trying to write a Firefox Addon with the Addon SDK to redirect some websites based on their URL. I have created a HTML page and put it in the data directory. I get the path with:</p>  <pre><code>var data = require("sdk/self").data; var myWebsite = data.url("myWebsite.html"); </code></pre>  <p>I'm using PageMod to start a script given an array of URLs:</p>  <pre><code>pageMod.PageMod({     include: ArrayOfUrls,     contentScriptFile: "./myScript.js",     contentScriptOptions: {"myWebsite" : myWebsite} }); </code></pre>  <p>In myScript.js I'm checking if some requirements are fulfilled and if so I try to redirect to my local website with:</p>  <pre><code>window.location.replace(self.options.myWebsite); </code></pre>  <p>But I always get the following error message in the console:</p>  <pre><code>Object - _errorType = Error - message = Access to 'resource://myAddon/data/myWebsite.html' from script denied </code></pre>  <p>If I enter the path to the local website (resource://myAddon/...) manually in the adress bar of the browser it works. If I redirect to another website (e.g. <a href="http://example.com/" rel="nofollow">http://example.com/</a>) it works as well.</p>  <p>So I guess there's a security setting or so I need to change to make the local redirect possible, but I can't find anything in the documentation or on the web. I hope somebody here can tell me what I'm doing wrong.</p>
