<p>I'm trying to write my fist firefox addon, but I can't seem to get jpm working. My OS is Windows 7. I have node js installed and I'm trying to follow the instructions <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Tools/jpm#Installation" rel="nofollow">here</a> to install the add-on sdk. However, after I install jpm and I try running the command, I get the error jpm is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program, or batch file." below is a screenshot of the command prompt window.<a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/aYEmI.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/aYEmI.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
