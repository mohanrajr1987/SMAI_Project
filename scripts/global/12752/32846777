<p>I'm newby to FF Add-Ons and its SDK, so I'm trying to figure out some basic concepts.  The first thing I wish to clarify - relations between <code>tabs-sdk</code> and <code>workers</code>. As I got from documentation - every time I attach content-scripts to tab via</p>  <pre><code>this.activeWorker = tabs.activeTab.attach({     contentScript: script }); </code></pre>  <p>I'm getting a <code>worker</code>. But my question is: "Is it a totally new <code>worker</code>, related to the same <code>activeTab</code>?" If so, does it mean, that the next statement is correct?</p>  <pre><code>var firstWorker = tabs.activeTab.attach({     contentScript: someScript });  var secondWorker = tabs.activeTab.attach({     contentScript: someOtherScript });  var isEqual = (firstWorker === secondWorker); //false </code></pre>  <p>And if it's correct, the next question is: "Is there a way, to listen for messages on tab and not on worker?" </p>
