<p>I have an AngularJS app that I wish to wrap into a Firefox extension. Using JPM I've been able to load the app in via the data folder. However, due to the permissions available to "page scripts" I'm not able to make any calls to the web services that I use for data. </p>  <p>I'm wondering if I was to minify the javascript aspects of the app into a single file and load it in as a "Content-Script" will I be able to make requests to my external web service?</p>  <p>If there's a better way in general to allow an extension to access external data please could you link me to an example? </p>
