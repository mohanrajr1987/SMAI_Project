<p>I am working on a Firefox add-on which among other stuff generates thumbnails of websites for use by the add-on. So far I've been storing them by their image data URL using simple-storage. Two problems with this: the storage space is limited and sending very long strings around doesn't seem optimal(I assume the browser has optimized ways of loading image files, but maybe not data URLs). I think it shouldn't be a problem to save the files to disk, the question is where though. I googled quite a bit and could not find anything. Is there a natural place for this? Are there any restrictions?</p>
