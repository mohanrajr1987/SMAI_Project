<p>I built a chrome extension and everything worked well. Now i need to put it on firefox, and it's a f*** mess.</p>  <p>The problem is with dom parsing.</p>  <p>Her's the code that doesn't work on FF : </p>  <pre><code>var parser = new DOMParser(); SOURCE_DOM = parser.parseFromString(data.url, "text/html"); </code></pre>  <p>SOURCE_DOM always return an object empty :</p>  <pre><code>Object : {location : null} </code></pre>  <p>On chrome there's no problem with that, it gives me the document object and i can properly work with it. But Firefox is a pain in the ass compared to chrome when it comes to extension building.</p>  <p>Someone would know how to get the document ?</p>
