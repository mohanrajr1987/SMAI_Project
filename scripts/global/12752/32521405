<p>I have found out that Firebug for Firefox is an open source project and we can extend it.</p>  <p>By searching for documentaion about Firebug extension development I found the following website:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/extending-firebug/" rel="nofollow">http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/extending-firebug/</a></p>  <p>Unfortunately its petty old and doesn't have information for current versions (i.e. 2.0.x) of Firebug.</p>  <p>My goal is to extend Firebug's inspector feature.</p>  <p>So can anyone please tell where I can find an up-to-date guide for Firebug extension development?</p>
