<p>So, I'm utterly and completely new to making Firefox add-ons. I have been trying to make a really, <em>really</em> simple one which will run some JavaScript on the page when I click it. That's literally all I want it to do -_-<br> However, it will install when I drag it into FF/Nightly, but then not show up in the customise menu. It will say it's installed, but that's it. (I also can't open its preferences, but, I'm really not complaining - I just want a really basic add-on).</p>  <p>If you need the code/entire XPI itself, I'm happy to supply. Thank you :)</p>  <p>I am using the following directories and files:</p>  <pre><code>. ├── chrome │   ├── chrome.manifest │   ├── content │   │   ├── boustrophedonise.js │   │   ├── browser.xul │   │   └── prefrences.xul │   ├── locale │   │   └── en-UK │   │       └── translations.dtd │   └── skin │       ├── icon.png │       └── skin.css ├── defaults │   └── preferences │       └── pref.js └── install.rdf </code></pre>
