<p>I've created a firefox addon from an angularjs application I made previously. I'm injecting this app into the extention as a content script so I can make XHR requests to an API. However I do not seem to be able to debug the content scripts when I run the app using JPM. The docs mention mention a caveat about debugging content scripts <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/Add-on_Debugger#Content_scripts" rel="nofollow">here</a> it doesn't explain how to actually debug them.</p>  <p>I feel I'm just missing something obvious. I was able to debug the add-on the first time I loaded it. But not since. Any help would be appreciated</p>
