<p>I am Using Firefox 40 and followed <a href="https://www.mozdevgroup.com/docs/pete/Signing-an-XPI.html" rel="nofollow">Signing an XPI</a> article to sign an XPI. Used certutil to sign the XPI, imported the X509.cacert in firefox Certificate Manager (Authorities tab) every step completed as mentioned in the article. Now if I install the XPI , I get popup.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Caution: This site would like to install an unverified add-on in Firefox</p> </blockquote>  <p>After installation the extension is working correctly.</p>  <p>However if I set the flag: xpinstall.signature.required  to true  and then try to install it . I get popup telling </p>  <blockquote>   <p>This add-on could not be installed as it appears to be corrupt.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Followed the steps in the article multiple times just to make sure I din't miss anything ..but still the same issue. Would appreciate any pointers to where to look for the problem.</p>
