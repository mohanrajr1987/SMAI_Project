<p>Received the message below from Mozilla AddOn editors with regards to our new version of our add on:</p>  <p>"Your add-on, iGive Button 5.0.0.9, has been reviewed and is now signed and ready for you to download at <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/addon/igive-button-1/versions" rel="nofollow">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/addon/igive-button-1/versions</a>."</p>  <p>When I go to that link, I'm supposed to be able to download the reviewed and now signed add on.  To try to do that, I clicked on the link which lets me manage the add on.  At the top of the Manade Add On screen there is a link to the file (igive_button-5.0.0.9-fx.xpi):  <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/352648/igive_button-5.0.0.9-fx.xpi?src=devhub" rel="nofollow">https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/352648/igive_button-5.0.0.9-fx.xpi?src=devhub</a></p>  <p>However, when I click that link I get a "404 Not Found" error.</p>  <p>How do I get the signed add-on so we can distribute it from our web site?</p>
