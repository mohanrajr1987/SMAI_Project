<p>I want to create a new profile with an addon preinstalled.</p>  <p>What works:</p>  <ul> <li>run firefox a first time.</li> <li>add the addon.xpi to <code>profile/extensions/addon.xpi</code>.</li> <li>edit profile <code>profile/extensions.ini</code> and add <code>Extension0=/full/path/to/extension.xpi</code>.</li> <li>start firefox again.</li> </ul>  <p>What i need:</p>  <ul> <li>add the addon to <code>profile/extensions/addon.xpi</code>.</li> <li>edit <code>extensions.ini</code> or something similiar.</li> <li>use only relative paths, if possible (seems not to be implemented for extensions.ini)</li> </ul>  <p>Finally i want to create a zip file with some firefox preferences/addons, which can be unziped into a profilefolder to create a fresh profile with some preinstalled stuff. For this, it would be important, that everything works with relative paths. If it is definitely not possible, i can add some script to it. But i would prefer some "just unzip" solution.</p>  <p>I think it may be a bit harder, because mozilla wanted to prevent other software from adding toolbars and similiar to firefox by making external addon installation harder. What i already found is the key <code>extensions.autoDisableScopes=0</code>.</p>
