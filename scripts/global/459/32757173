<p>I desperately try to integrate a Youtube Channel which is not my own into Hootsuite to post video updates into my facebook group. </p>  <p>I only get bogus results (posting of old videos) because Youtube RSS Feed uses the published tag whereas a valid format would be pubdate. Is there any way I can fix this?</p>  <p>I used following url: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?user=xxx" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?user=xxx</a></p>  <p>Thanks for your help.</p>
