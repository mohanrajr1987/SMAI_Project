<p>Currently I have accomplished with my introductory RSS reader MVC project a basic template whereby I am pulling in RSS articles from yahoo finance. This was exciting until i realized the items returned do not contain full text of the articles, just descriptions and a link back to the yahoo finance site. I'd like to find a way to pull in the entire article whereby i may click on the title of an article from a list in my Home page and then in my Article page I can read that whole article. A reference to my current implementation may be found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32544755/error-reading-rss-feed-using-linq-to-xml?noredirect=1#comment53004146_32544755">here</a>. A link to the yahoo finance RSS feed information is available <a href="https://developer.yahoo.com/finance/company.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
