<p>I am adding an RSS feed to my website.  I created the RSS.xml index file and next I want to display its contents in a nicely formatted way in a webpage.</p>  <p>Using PHP, I can do this:</p>  <pre><code>$index = file_get_contents ($path . 'RSS.xml'); echo $index; </code></pre>  <p>But all that does is dump the contents as a long stream of text with the tags removed.</p>  <p>I know that treating RSS.xml as a link, like this:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;a href="../blogs/RSS.xml"&gt;   &lt;img src="../blogs/feed-icon-16.gif"&gt;Blog Index &lt;/a&gt; </code></pre>  <p>causes my browser to parse and display it in a reasonable way when the user clicks on the link.  However I want to embed it directly in the web page and not make the user go through another click.</p>  <p>What is the proper way to do what I want?</p>
