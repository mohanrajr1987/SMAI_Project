<p>Just want to make sure something is possible before I go ahead and start looking into it. I have a single xml file that is updated via a form that allows you to change the data on the xml file. </p>  <p>I would like to have an rss feed with ajax to dynamically update when ever a change is made to an item on the xml file. For example</p>  <pre><code>People    Person 1       age 32       sex male    person 1    person 2       age 31       sex female    person 2 People </code></pre>  <p>So if I updated Person 1 sex to female, the rss feed would update to say that person 1 was change to female with a time and date, then the next day if I updated the age it would add a new entry showing the age was change.</p>  <p>Is this possible?   </p>
