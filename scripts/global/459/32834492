<p>I've coded a blog as well as an RSS feed, and all works well. However, in checking out my RSS feed on Feedly recently, I noticed that when I type in <strong>My Web Site</strong> my feed doesn't appear in their search, but does when I type <strong>mywebsite.com</strong> (and not until I type in that last "<strong>m</strong>" in <strong>com</strong>).</p>  <p>This is my RSS file:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?&gt; &lt;rss version="2.0"&gt;      &lt;channel&gt;          &lt;title&gt;My Web Site&lt;/title&gt;         &lt;link&gt;http://mywebsite.com&lt;/link&gt;         &lt;description&gt;Blog posts about lots of stuff&lt;/description&gt;          &lt;item&gt;             &lt;title&gt;First blog post&lt;/title&gt;             &lt;link&gt;http://mywebsite.com/first-blog-post&lt;/link&gt;             &lt;guid&gt;http://mywebsite.com/first-blog-post&lt;/guid&gt;             &lt;pubDate&gt;Fri, 11 Sep 2015 10:30:00 GMT&lt;/pubDate&gt;             &lt;description&gt;This is the first blog post for the website My Web Site.&lt;/description&gt;         &lt;/item&gt;      &lt;/channel&gt;  &lt;/rss&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I also have this in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of every page of my blog:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;link rel="alternate" href="http://mywebsite.com/rss" title="My Web Site" type="application/rss+xml"&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I would have assumed that <code>&lt;title&gt;My Web Site&lt;/title&gt;</code> or <code>title="My Web Site"</code> would have been enough to enable the RSS feed to be found in Feedly searches, but apparently not (yet for some reason Feedly's search has no problem locating my RSS feed when I type in <strong>mywebsite.com</strong>).</p>  <p>I checked out Feedly's site and came across this page for optimizing one's feed:</p>  <p><a href="http://blog.feedly.com/2015/07/31/10-ways-to-optimize-your-feed-for-feedly" rel="nofollow">http://blog.feedly.com/2015/07/31/10-ways-to-optimize-your-feed-for-feedly</a></p>  <p>I can't see (or decipher) anything in there that would solve my problem. Any ideas? (Thanks in advance.)</p>  <p><strong>Addition:</strong></p>  <p>Just as I was about to post this I found this coding on another site (which does properly appear in Feedly's search) and am wondering if any of it may do the trick. (However, seeing how I don't know how often Feedly refreshes their searches, I haven't tried them yet.)</p>  <pre><code>&lt;link rel="alternate" type="application/atom+xml" title="RESOURCE CRISIS - Atom" href="http://cassandralegacy.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default" /&gt; &lt;link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" title="RESOURCE CRISIS - RSS" href="http://cassandralegacy.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss" /&gt; &lt;link rel="service.post" type="application/atom+xml" title="RESOURCE CRISIS - Atom" href="https://www.blogger.com/feeds/4342811133328800388/posts/default" /&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Should I be adding in some Atom information? Thanks!</p>
