<p>I am about to create a custom RSS feed for my WordPress blog. Although I am pretty unsure of what I am exactly doing.</p>  <p><em>The feed needs to send following:</em> </p>  <p><em>Title</em> - Title of the blog post</p>  <p><em>Image</em> - and when you click on it it should link you to the blog post </p>  <p><em>Description</em> - Some defined phrase like "post created by bla-bla"</p>  <p><em>Link</em> - Link to the blog post </p>  <p>I have followed the guide published by WPBeginner, but it only crashed my blog several times. I understand that it is more my fault, but it would be highly appreciated, is someone can give the solution for this.</p>  <p>Thanks guys.</p>
