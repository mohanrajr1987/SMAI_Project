<p>I am creating an rss reader app which will search google news as per multiple  <strong>search-terms</strong> provided by the user. For that I need to form an <strong>url</strong> manually which would get the news for the user. The url should provide a the news when at least one <strong>search-terms</strong> is found on the news article. I have found it so far. But I could not figure it out how multiple search-terms will be added in the url below. </p>  <blockquote>   <p><a href="https://news.google.de/news/feeds?pz=1&amp;cf=all&amp;ned=LANGUAGE&amp;hl=COUNTRY&amp;q=SEARCH_TERM&amp;output=rss" rel="nofollow">https://news.google.de/news/feeds?pz=1&amp;cf=all&amp;ned=LANGUAGE&amp;hl=COUNTRY&amp;q=SEARCH_TERM&amp;output=rss</a></p> </blockquote>  <p>I have no experience will urls so apologize for the silly question. Any help will be appreciated. Thank you in advance.</p>
