<p>This seems like such a simple thing that it isn't worth a question, but I haven't yet found the answer! I am parsing an RSS feed using </p>  <pre><code>@rss_industry = RSS::Parser.parse('http://construction.com/rss/construction.xml', false) </code></pre>  <p>This brings back the entire feed. I simply want to limit the number of items returned. Is there a simple way to do this?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
