<p>In a <code>foreach</code> simplexml include, say I have 4 titles that look like this:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>There are books that are cool </p>      <p>Movies are great </p>      <p>I like books </p>      <p>Music is Musical</p> </blockquote>  <p>And I want to only display only the results that have "books" in the title, how can I omit the other results so that it only shows:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>There are books that are cool </p>      <p>I like books</p> </blockquote>  <pre><code> &lt;?php  $feed = file_get_contents("url.xml"); $xml = new SimpleXmlElement($feed); foreach ($xml-&gt;entry as $entry1){        $title = $entry1-&gt;title;     $vidid = $entry1-&gt;id;      $date = $entry1-&gt;published; ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Would I be able to use preg_match or str_replace?</p>  <p>Thanks!!</p>
