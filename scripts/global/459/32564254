<p>Here is what I am doing right now</p>  <pre><code> $rss = new DOMDocument();  $rss-&gt;load('http://feeds.feedburner.com/androidcentral?format=xml');  echo filemtime('http://feeds.feedburner.com/androidcentral?format=xml'); </code></pre>  <p>It gives <code>stat failed</code> error. What I was trying to do is get last modification time of the feed and see if it is different from the last time I scraped it. Obviously, it does not work. I read <a href="http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/2002/10/21/http_conditional_get_for_rss_hackers/" rel="nofollow">this article</a> where author says:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>When you receive the RSS file from the webserver, check the response header for two fields: Last-Modified and ETag. You don't have to care what is in these headers, you just have to store them somewhere with the RSS file.</p>      <p>Next time you request the RSS file, include two headers in your request.. Your If-Modified-Since header should contain the value you snagged from the Last-Modified header earlier. The If-None-Match header should contain the value you snagged from the ETag header.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I have never worked with headers before. Could anyone help me on how to check if a feed has changed since last time it was visited?</p>
