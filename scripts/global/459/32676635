<p>I need to create a RSS feed of newsletter content created in Exacttarget. This newsletter is created and sent everyday by Exacttarget. RSS feed will be displayed in two different websites. I've gone through the documentation but couldn't find any out-of-box implementation. Is there any OOB implementation available?</p>  <p>To achieve this, I'm thinking about following steps:</p>  <ol> <li>Through FuelSDK I will get the html body of the newsletter. </li> <li>Create xml from html output.</li> </ol>  <p>I'm using this code to get the html of the newletter but it's coming as null:</p>  <pre><code>ETClient client = new ETClient(configuration); ETEmail mail = new ETEmail(); mail.setClient(client); String body = mail.getHtmlBody(); </code></pre>  <p>Ideas on where the problem should be?</p>
