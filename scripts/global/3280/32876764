<p>Let me give a sample code to better explain .Below is the code :</p>  <pre><code>$routeProvider   .when("/b/:param",{     templateUrl:"main.html"     controller:"MainCtrl"   })   .when("/c/:param",{     templateUrl:"main.html"   }); </code></pre>  <p>Now from the above code you can see that for one route I have specified the controller that is to be assigned to the view and for the other I didn't add the controller property so for that route there won't be any controller assigned on the page .</p>  <blockquote>   <h1>Now my question :</h1>      <p><strong>When I don't specify the controller property in the route is there any other way that I can assign the controller for that route   dynamically?</strong></p> </blockquote>  <h1>What I have tried</h1>  <ul> <li><p>I have gone through some of the SO pages related to this, one of which is -> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18423054/dynamically-loading-the-controller-in-angularjs-routeprovider">dynamically loading the controller in angularjs $routeProvider</a></p>  <p>Now I have tried some solutions from the post above which didn't work for me .If any from them works please give me more information on how to implement them .</p>  <p>Solutions like setting controller within page or using ui-router are not the type of solutions I am looking for .So please don't give answers like that .</p></li> <li><p>I tried setting controller using some of the functions available through $controllerProvider &amp; $controller , $routeProvider &amp; $route but didn't work out .I am still not sure if using them I can do the task if they do please answer how to use them .</p></li> </ul>  <p>If question still remains unclear please add a comment below this question .Thanks .</p>
