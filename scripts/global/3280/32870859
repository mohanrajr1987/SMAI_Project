<p>I have restify application (simple API). We use csurf library for preventing CSRF requests.</p>  <p>But I need don't use CSRF validation on several routes.</p>  <p>First idea, which I think - this create array with routes for which I don't need use csrf and validate current route.</p>  <pre><code>var routesNoCSRF = ['/api/route1', '/api/route2']; if (routesNoCSRF.indexOf(currentRoute) === -1) {   server.use(csrf({     cookie: true,     ignoreMethods: ['HEAD', 'OPTIONS']   })); } </code></pre>  <p>But on this step I didn't have access to currentRoute</p>  <p>Second - this divide one API to 2 different APis - and for first use csrf validation for second - not. In this case - we create 2 different servers, which listen 2 different ports.</p>  <p>But i would to do this with using only one app. Is it possible ?</p>
