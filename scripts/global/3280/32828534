<p>Given I have an arbitrary URL mapped (amongst many others) like this</p>  <pre><code>... Route::get('/foobar/{parameter}', 'MyFoobarController@index'); ... </code></pre>  <p>How can I "reverse parse/resolve" the URL (<code>like http://localhost/foobar/foo</code>) into this configured controller (<code>MyFoobarController</code>) again? Please note: I am not talking about the current Request but a general approach to parse any URL that is mapped in Laravel to its corresponding Controller and Action (anywhere in the code independent of the current request). Thanks!</p>  <p><strong>Update:</strong> It should also correctly match Routes, that have parameters in them.</p>
