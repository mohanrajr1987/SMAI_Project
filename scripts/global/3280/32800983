<p>I would like to add routes at run time. I read that its possible but I am not so sure how. Currently I using the following code:</p>  <pre><code>var app = express();  function CreateRoute(route){ app.use(route, require('./routes/customchat.js')); } </code></pre>  <p>And customchat looks like </p>  <pre><code>var express = require('express'); var router = express.Router();  router.route('/').get(function (req, res) { var url =  req.baseUrl; var roomname = url.substring(url.lastIndexOf('_') + 1); res.render('chat', { name: roomname , year: new Date().getFullYear().toString()}); });  module.exports = router; </code></pre>  <p>When I call the method CreateRoute before I start listening it will link the route. But when I do it at runtime it wont create a new route. My goal is to add routes add runtime. I will generate an path like /room_Date. And this should be added at runtime using the template customchat.</p>  <p>I am using express version 4.13.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p>
