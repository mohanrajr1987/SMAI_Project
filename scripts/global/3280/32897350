<p>I have route in rails that is executing twice per click.  First the route is as follows - (it is the print_cert route in the collection that is executing twice):</p>  <pre><code> resources :acd_certificates, only: [:edit, :update] do     collection do       get :print_cert, defaults: { format: 'pdf' }     end   end </code></pre>  <p>And it is called from an edit form:</p>  <pre><code>  &lt;div class="form-actions"&gt;     &lt;%= f.submit "Save Certificate", class: "btn btn-primary" %&gt;     &lt;%= link_to print_cert_acd_certificates_path, class: "btn btn-primary" do %&gt;      &lt;span class="glyphicon glyphicon-print"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Print     &lt;% end %&gt;     &lt;%= link_to 'Cancel', @client, :class =&gt; 'btn' %&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>No other route in this controller is reacting the same way.  There is no javascript on the form (and the form is not a partial) or in a separate js or coffee file.  The application does utilize jQuery in several locations, but not anywhere in the add_certificates unit.</p>  <p>I stripped all code out of the controller method print_cert and it still calls twice.  </p>  <p>Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong> Add the log output:</p>  <pre><code>Started GET "/acd_certificates/print_cert" for 73.48.173.116 at 2015-10-01 22:32:36 +0000 Processing by AcdCertificatesController#print_cert as PDF   User Load (0.5ms)  SELECT  "users".* FROM "users" WHERE "users"."id" = $1  ORDER BY "users"."id" ASC LIMIT 1  [["id", 1]] Sent file /home/ubuntu/workspace/tmp/pdfs/b6cda84f-da89-460d-976a-af863def9161.pdf (0.3ms) Completed 200 OK in 186ms (ActiveRecord: 0.5ms)   Started GET "/acd_certificates/print_cert" for 73.48.173.116 at 2015-10-01 22:32:37 +0000 Processing by AcdCertificatesController#print_cert as PDF   User Load (0.8ms)  SELECT  "users".* FROM "users" WHERE "users"."id" = $1  ORDER BY "users"."id" ASC LIMIT 1  [["id", 1]] Sent file /home/ubuntu/workspace/tmp/pdfs/b1348c24-bec7-442c-8b1f-0927e82ffe93.pdf (0.2ms) Completed 200 OK in 188ms (ActiveRecord: 0.8ms) </code></pre>
