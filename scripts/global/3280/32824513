<p>So in my <code>routes.php</code> file as the LAST route I have this:</p>  <pre><code>$route['(:any)'] = '/page/index/$1'; </code></pre>  <p>This is used for dynamic pages url like <code>foo/dynamic-page</code> the problem here is that if I have a controller called <code>something.php</code> and the route will be <code>foo/something</code> and it's not manually declared in the <code>routes.php</code> file it will return a 404 because I think it will hit the <code>(:any)</code> route.</p>  <p>The question will be: How to make the router init a static route first before going to check dynamic page route</p>
