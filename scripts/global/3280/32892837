<p>I have one route like:</p>  <pre><code>GET     /latest/:repo/:artifact     controllers.Find.findLatestArtifact(repo: String, artifact: String) </code></pre>  <p>that works as a restful api for us. But now, I have a new view with an html form that need to send actions to that controller filling up the parameters with two html selects from the form.</p>  <p>I have tried adding another route like:</p>  <pre><code>GET     /latest     controllers.Find.findLatestArtifact() </code></pre>  <p>and overloading the controller method to read the http get parameters manually, but it does not like it.</p>  <p>Previously in the past I already asked here how to fill up parameters from a html form, in a controller that does not have 0 args:</p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32722643/binding-an-html-form-action-to-a-controller-method-that-takes-some-parameters">Binding an html form action to a controller method that takes some parameters</a></p>  <p>and seems that it was not possible. Then, how do I workaround this, without having to rename the controller method?</p>
