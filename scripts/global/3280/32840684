<p>I need to be able to define routes where the <code>/{_locale}</code> part is optional. This means I need these URLs to use the same controller:</p>  <ol> <li><code>my-domain.com/</code> (the locale will be set by a request listener)</li> <li><code>my-domain.com/[any-locale]/</code></li> </ol>  <p>Same goes with:</p>  <ol start="3"> <li><code>my-domain.com/my-page</code> (the locale will be set by a request listener)</li> <li><code>my-domain.com/[any-locale]/my-page</code></li> </ol>  <p>The problem is I can't define two class <code>@Route</code> annotations as this isn't valid/accepted by Symfony; and I can't duplicate each and every route in my controller classes because there will be a large number and that would be really bad!</p>  <p>I've tried having only one class annotation but I couldn't get it to work. Here are my attempts:</p>  <h1>First:</h1>  <pre><code>/**  * @Route("/{_locale}", requirements={"_locale": "(\w{2,3})?"})  */ class DefaultController extends Controller {      /**      * @Route("/")      * @param Request $request      * @return Response      */     public function indexAction(Request $request) {         return new Response('index '.$request-&gt;getLocale());     }      /**      * @Route("/my-page")      * @param Request $request      * @return Response      */     public function testAction(Request $request) {         return new Response('test '.$request-&gt;getLocale());     }  } </code></pre>  <p>Conclusions:</p>  <ol> <li>Works</li> <li>Works</li> <li>Fails (because only <code>my-domain.com//my-page</code> would work)</li> <li>Works</li> </ol>  <h1>Second:</h1>  <p>I thought the problem was the leading slash, so i tried this:</p>  <pre><code>/**  * @Route("{slash_and_locale}", requirements={"slash_and_locale": "\/?(\w{2,3})?"}, defaults={"slash_and_locale": ""})  */ class DefaultController extends Controller { // ... </code></pre>  <p>Conclusions:</p>  <ol> <li>Works</li> <li>Works</li> <li>Fails (same reason)</li> <li>Works</li> </ol>  <p>I've seen this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/13358873/282695">(old) question</a> but no proper answer has been submitted yet :(</p>  <p>Anyone with a suggestion? Would be really helpful, thanks!</p>
