<p>I need to create a route with some fixed and dynamic parts. Basically I need to be flexible on the second segment on the url. If the url starts with 'products/test....' then the route has to go to the PageController, all other routes starting with 'products/....' have to go to the ProductController.</p>  <pre><code>// Something like this: Route::any('products/".starts_with($slug, 'test'), [     'uses' =&gt; 'PageController@show' ])-&gt;where('slug', '(.*)?');  Route::get('products/{slug}', [     'uses' =&gt; 'ProductController@show' ]); </code></pre>  <p>Is this possible in Laravel 5?</p>
