<p>Can Publicly accessible Azure Mobile Services, hosted via PaaS, access a private internal network if there was an existing Express Route setup?</p>  <p>So basically, a user with a Smart Phone calls an Azure Hosted PaaS Mobile Service, the mobile services then communicates, through the Express Route, with objects (like a database or other services) hosted in the private network and then respond to the caller with some of that data.</p>  <p>Is this currently possible using PaaS and an Express Route?</p>
