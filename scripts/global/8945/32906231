<p>Where does grails (v2.3.6) look for maven settings?</p>  <p>I've tried to configure local maven repo, but grails ignores settings.xml from custom maven installation set in IDEA (v14) settings and default path <code>&lt;user&gt;\.m2\settings.xml</code></p>  <p>The solution might be additional config file for project, where you can set this path to repo for your machine, and pass it to mavenLocal() in the BuildConfig. But why should I duplicate that info if it's already configured in local maven settings.</p>
