<p>I'm on Arch linux x64 machine , I installed intellij idea but whenever I open a project a startupabortedexception occurs with the JavaDoc browser plugin.  </p>  <p>I looked into my idea.log and figured out that it can't find javax.servlet.Servlet, I disabled the plugin in order to open a java project and indeed when I type <code>import javax;</code> it says it can't find javax.  </p>  <p>I have java-openjfx installed and still intellij can't find it, what to do in this case ?  . </p>  <h2>Environment information</h2>  <p>jdk:openjdk 1.8.0_60 64 bit.<br> intellij version: 14.1.5 community edition.</p>
