<p>I'm getting this message:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>ERROR StatusLogger Unable to access file:log4j.properties   java.io.FileNotFoundException: log4j.properties (No such file or   directory)... (+ stacktrace)</p> </blockquote>  <p>...despite telling Maven to get 2.1 AND I have log4j2.xml AND I do not have a log4j.properties. My log4j2.xml is working very well doing just what I want it to.</p>  <p>I get this in the console whenever I run JUnit (4.x) tests.</p>  <p>I am using IntelliJ to Run/Debug. I'm using JDK 1.8.0_25.</p>  <p>It is true that this is the first time I've used log4j 2.x, but I do not understand why this stacktrace is showing up as if I had log4j 1.x JARs or were asking for log4j 1.x.</p>  <pre><code>$ mvn dependency:tree [INFO] --- maven-dependency-plugin:2.8:tree (default-cli) @ cda-feeder --- [INFO] com.imatsolutions:cda-feeder:jar:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT [INFO] +- sax:sax:jar:2.0.1:compile [INFO] +- org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-api:jar:2.1:compile [INFO] +- org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core:jar:2.1:compile [INFO] \- junit:junit:jar:4.11:test [INFO]    \- org.hamcrest:hamcrest-core:jar:1.3:test </code></pre>
