<p>Given a sample gradle project with project structure as shown:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/rxt6B.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/rxt6B.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>As you can see there are bunch of stuff you actually dont ever need to see in idea but you need them to exist...</p>  <p>I know about ignored file/folder types under <code>Editor/File Types</code> but those are affecting the libs and projects, idea will ignore them everywhere while i only need to hide few unnecessary entries in project view.</p>  <p><strong>Primary question : how do we hide them from project view?</strong></p>  <p>Also for very big projects somethimes it is easy if some related modules are shown one after another... but do not do like that alphabeticaly.</p>  <p><strong>Secondary question : is it possible to have customized order in project view?</strong></p>  <p>I'm using <code>Intellij 15 EAP IU-142.5047.6</code></p>
