<p>I switched from sublime text to phpstorm recently and missing the permute reverse selection feature from sublime (CTRL+T on windows).</p>  <p>More clear: Swapping selections with each other.</p>  <p>From </p>  <pre><code>xxx yyy </code></pre>  <p>to</p>  <pre><code>yyy xxx </code></pre>  <p>Do you guys know if there is something equivalent in PhpStorm? I didn't find anything in the www.</p>
