<p>I'm using IntelliJ IDEA 14 under OS X, Windows and Ubuntu for several months, found that the keymap Mac OS X 10.5+ is more suitable for me and want to keep same experience under all platforms.</p>  <p>OS X has five modifier keys: Shift, Caps Lock, Control, Option, and Command, while Windows/Ubuntu has only four: Shift, Caps Lock, Control and Alt. If I want to use Mac OS X 10.5 keymap under Windows/Ubuntu, then I need map a key to Command key which plays a great role.</p>  <p>Under Ubuntu I remapped Windows key to Meta key using xmodmap, but I could not find how to do it under Windows. I've tried key remappers such as SharpKeys, but none of them can remap keys to Command/Meta key. So is there a way to do it?</p>
