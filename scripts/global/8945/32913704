<p>It's annoying and attention grabbing when Intellij will highlight all kinds of stuff like simplify something or a suggestion, or a warning of some kind. </p>  <p>Many times, I like the thank you mam, but stop bothering me. This is not relevant. </p>  <p>However, Intellij will only allow you to ignore the type of warning globally, which is kind of dangerous to do. </p>  <p>I am aware that you can add an annotation, but I don't want to pollute my classes with annotations and comments everywhere. Also, @SuppressWarnings("ALL") is applied even suggestions, not even on warnings. </p>  <p>Can't Intellij manage this using a project file ? Also, Intellij should add a line to the right to show where such a supression has been done. </p>  <p>Problem right now, is that once you supress globally it's almost impossible to undo, or revise.</p>  <p>I mean <code>@SuppressWarnings({"PointlessBooleanExpression", "ConstantConditions"})</code> is hardly Java related, and should not be added to the code. </p>  <p>It should be managed by the editor. It must also be made so that it's easily editable and an overview can be seen for the entire project files. </p>  <p>Is this possible already?</p>
