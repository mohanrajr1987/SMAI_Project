<p>In Eclipse, most of the coverage plugins, display covered/partially covered/uncovered lines with different colors (i.e. <strong>the whole line painted with a color</strong>)</p>  <p><strong>In IntelliJ Idea, I couldn't find a way yet to paint the whole line with a descriptive color</strong>, only a small, almost imperceptible mark is added on the left hand side, making the visualization of partially covered / uncovered lines really difficult.</p>  <p>Any idea?</p>
