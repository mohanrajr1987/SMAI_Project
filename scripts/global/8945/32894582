<p>I'm using stanford nlp to do sentiment analysis. I just need the sentiment score therefore following are the libraries that I'm adding into my project: 1) ejml-0.23.jar 2) stanford-corenlp-3.5.2.jar 3) stanford-corenlp-3.5.2-models.jar</p>  <p>When I add dependencies in the Project Structure in IntelliJ, first two work fine and are imported correctly and shown in the external libraries tab. But for the models.jar it throws me an error saying that IDEA cannot determine what kind of files the chosen item contains. When I still go ahead and add it - I don't see the models.jar file in the External Libraries section.
