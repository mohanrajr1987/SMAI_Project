<p>I'm developing a game in Java (8) using Intellij Idea. Since I need controller support (XBox Controllers and the like), I seems the JInput library would help me support that.</p>  <p>I added the <code>net.java.jinput:jinput:2.0.6</code> library via maven (project structure > libraries), but when I run it, I get the following:</p>  <pre><code>WARNING: Attempting to use default windows plug-in. java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no jinput-dx8 in java.library.path </code></pre>  <p>I did some googling and fiddled around with it but I'm not able to get this working.</p>
