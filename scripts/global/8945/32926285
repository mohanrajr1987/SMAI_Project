<p>I recently got myself a mac and I'm really confused at why my intelliJ does not seem to have an option to "Run" the main method that is sitting in my Application.java. I'm just trying to run a basic example.</p>  <p>On Windows, I normally I just right click on the Application.java file and select "Run Application.main()" and then it runs but on my mac version of intelliJ there is no such option:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/DMzvD.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/DMzvD.png" alt="run main method"></a></p>  <p>Then I try to set the config by clicking "Edit Configuration":</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/HV6bZ.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/HV6bZ.png" alt="edit config"></a></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/1u4s0.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/1u4s0.png" alt="edit config"></a></p>  <p>And then I tried to set my Main class as "Application.java" but it does not let me click "OK".</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/L2EyZ.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/L2EyZ.png" alt="choose main class"></a></p>  <p>I'm using java 1.8 to compile:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/LD43p.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/LD43p.png" alt="java"></a></p>
