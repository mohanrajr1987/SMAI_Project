<p>If I wanted to use just the normal git via the command line and not the one in IntelliJ, what do I need to include in the version control so when I download it, I can get the Maven libraries without manually installing them?</p>  <p>Edit: There is no pom.xml file when the libraries are added to an IntelliJ project, so I was wondering what I need to include so Maven inside IntelliJ can download the libraries.</p>
