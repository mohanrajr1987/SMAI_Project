<p>I use <a href="http://thucydides.info/" rel="nofollow">Serenity BDD</a> for test automation on my project, IntelliJ IDEA as IDE. I would like to change format and debug level of the logs I can see everytime I run tests. </p>  <p>For example, I want to see logs only from [main] thread:</p>  <pre><code>[main] INFO net.thucydides.core.reports.junit.JUnitXMLOutcomeReport [pool-3-thread-1] INFO net.thucydides.core.reports.ReportService -  </code></pre>  <p>I know how to do it for logback, but I can't find any info on how and where one should change log settings for Serenity.</p>
