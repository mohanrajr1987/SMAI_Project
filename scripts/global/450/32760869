<p>I have made a GUI using python and tkinter, which allows the user to choose search criterias to be used in an MS Access query. Upon a buttonclick, the script opens Access and runs a macro which in turn launches a function that reads the user input, performs the query and prints reports. The code used to do this is:</p>  <pre><code>objAccess = win32com.client.Dispatch("Access.application") objAccess.Visible = False objAccess.OpenCurrentDatabase(filepath) objAccess.DoCmd.RunMacro("Macro1") objAccess.Quit() </code></pre>  <p>My problem is that I want to put the database and the python script on a network drive so that my coworkers may use the script to generate reports without having to open the database in Access (and inevitably make inadvertent changes). Whenever the script is run for the first time from someone else's PC, it will not complete, as the macros have not been enabeled from that pc. If they open the database and enable macros and make the document "trusted", the script will work fine.</p>  <p>What I want to know is if there is any way to enable macros permanetly for all users for that particular Access database, or if I can modify my script to check if the database has macros enabled or not, and to enable macros if they are disabled.</p>  <p>I know that the disabling of macros is a security measure, so I guess I may just have to ask my users to manually enable macros before running the script. Not very elegant.</p>
