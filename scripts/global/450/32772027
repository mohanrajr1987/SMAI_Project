<p>I currently have a formula which reads:      </p>  <pre><code>ADDRESS(MATCH(Schedule!A2,Wins!$A$1:$A$33,0),MATCH(Schedule!C2,Wins!$A$1:$AG$1,0)) </code></pre>  <p>I want to be able to use the cell reference returned in a macro for other calculations. I am new to Macros and was confused by some of the code in similar questions. I would like to use the returned reference in a calculation such as.</p>  <pre><code>Worksheets("Record").Range("**").Value = Worksheets("Record").Range("**") - 1 </code></pre>  <p>In the similar question asked in link below seems to return the value in a message box. I won't have the errors listed in the post as I will always be matching the entire cell contents, which will always match a value in the reference vectors and never be empty. The other thing is I don't understand the <code>xlValues, xlWhole</code> is for. Here is the code from that post. </p>  <pre><code>Sub GetCell()   Dim ws As Worksheet    Dim rng1 As Range    Set ws = Sheets("submitted")    Set rng1 = ws.Columns("A").Find(Sheets("To_Approve").[d19], , xlValues, xlWhole)    If Not rng1 Is Nothing Then       MsgBox rng1.Address &amp; " in sheet " &amp; ws.Name    Else     MsgBox "not found", vbCritical    End If End Sub </code></pre>  <p>I also tried:</p>  <pre><code>Worksheets("Wins").Cells(WorksheetFunction.Match(A1*,A1:A33,0),     WorksheetFunction.Match(C1*,A1:A33,0).Address </code></pre>  <p>The problem I had is that the <code>A1*</code> and <code>C1*</code> need to come from sheet <code>schedule</code> while the <code>A1:A33</code> need to come from Sheet <code>Wins</code>. Also it would not take the range <code>A1:A33</code> because of the ":"</p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8398930/excel-using-match-and-address-functions-within-macro-or-vba">Excel, Using Match and Address functions within Macro or VBA</a></p>
