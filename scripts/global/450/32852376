<p>I am creating a Macro for a Guided Web Inspect and unfortunately for me the Application uses a 2 factor authentication and the second token is randomly generated and email to me. </p>  <p>I am curious if I can manually enter the second passphrase and then allow the scan to continue. I have reached out to Fortify.Support, but they have a 24 hour turn over on inquiry's and my SLA is close to breaching!  </p>
