<p>I have an XForm document in LibreOffice Writer 5. The form contains various text boxes and date fields. What I want is to create a Javascript macro that will be assigned to one text box and perform some actions whenever the user changes the input of this field. So far I have written the following</p>  <pre><code>var oDoc = UnoRuntime.queryInterface(XModel, XSCRIPTCONTEXT.getInvocationContext()); if (!oDoc) {     oDoc = XSCRIPTCONTEXT.getDocument(); } var xFieldsSupplier = UnoRuntime.queryInterface(XFormsSupplier, oDoc); var xForm = xFieldsSupplier.getXForms(); </code></pre>  <p>but <em>xForm</em> is null. Does anyone know how I can get the XForm fields? Is there something wrong with the above code?</p>
