<p>I would like to create a macro that adds or deducts points in a table based on the name of the player that was selected. The points are mentioned next to each criteria, meaning that the user selects the player from the dropdown menu and then clicks the add or deduct button. The macro then searches for the name of the player in the score table and then add/deducts the points accordingly.</p>
