<p>I have an excel template which has dynamic rows and columns (it means the excel template will be downloaded based on the parameters I select in my UI). Now there will be some data in the excel sheet against those dynamic rows and columns coming from the database. I want to modify that excel and import it so that only the updated(modified) cell values are updated in database. I thought a lot and I think this can be done with macros (by changing the color of cells with updated values and picking them up from C#). I would welcome any other thoughts/approaches for this.</p>
