<p>I have hundreds of Catia V5 catparts and catproducts in a folder on hard disc. I want to know if a particular catpart is used in some catproduct or not. If it is not used in any product, I want to delete it and clean my hard disc. One way to do it is to open all catproducts one by one and check carefully they contain this model. This is cumbersome process and can lead to serious mistakes. Is there some automatic way to check it? If not, is it possible to write some macro for that purpose?</p>
