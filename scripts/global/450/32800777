<p>I was working with my System Software Internals project on Line by Line Macroprocessor. As it processes line by line through the input file and gives the processed line as input to the macro . I need to simulate this . I have modified the one pass assembler code for NASM . But instead of writing the o/p lines to an expanded file , i have to feed them to the assembler and get the o/p. How could i get the o/p of an assembler.</p>
