<p>Is there anyway to effectively cast (and or jump) to the statement a macro represents. Does this make sense? I.E I locate my macro as follows </p>  <pre><code>for (auto entity : *preprocessingRecord) {     if (auto mac = clang::dyn_cast&lt;clang::MacroExpansion&gt;(entity)) {         //now I wanna do something like this         or (auto range = mac-&gt;children(); range; ++range){....}  </code></pre>  <p>Is this possible, my guess is no as the AST and preprocessor aren't related, but are there any workarounds?</p>
