<p>So, let's say I have an arbitrarily long list of numbers. I'd like to get a list of every number in that list multiplied by every number in that list. I'd do that by nesting <code>for</code> loops like this:</p>  <pre><code>for x in numbers:     for y in numbers:         print(x*y) </code></pre>  <p>Now if I'd like to multiply every number in that list times every number in that list times every number in that list <em>again</em>, I'd do this:</p>  <pre><code>for x in numbers:     for y in numbers:         for z in numbers:             print(x*y*z) </code></pre>  <p>My issue is that I'm searching a graph for a subgraph, and I need to allow for arbitrarily large subgraphs. To do this I have to construct every subgraph with <em>n</em> edges from the edges in the main graph - and I have to allow for arbitrary values of <em>n</em>. How?</p>
