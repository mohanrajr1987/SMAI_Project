<p><a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=168" rel="nofollow">Project Euler problem #168</a>. My solution is:</p>  <pre><code>num = (10..10**10).inject(0) do |sum,x|  x.to_s.chars.rotate(-1).join.to_i % x == 0 ? sum += x : sum += 0 end puts num.to_s[-5..-1].to_i </code></pre>  <p>The problem I'm dealing with is that I don't know is if this 'solution' is right or wrong. When I try to run in on the terminal I don't get error messages or an answer. It just looks as if the answer is loading, but no answer appears.</p>  <p>I would assume that's because the array is so large, so how could I find the answer another way? I know there aren't bugs with the code because I tried a smaller range, like 10..10**6 and it worked. </p>
