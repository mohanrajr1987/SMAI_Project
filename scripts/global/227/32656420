<p>I'm taking an algorithms course, and I'm having a tough time figuring out how many times the following loop will execute.  I think the answer is log(n) (because of the mid=i/2), but I'm having a hard time convincing myself.  Any help or tips on figuring out how many times this loop will iterate would be great.  Thanks!</p>  <pre><code>def loop(arr):      i = len(arr) - 1     mid = i/2      while i &gt; 0:          i = mid - 1          mid = (i)/2 </code></pre>
