<p>I <em>can</em> do this quite easily, and cleanly, using a for loop. For instance, if I wanted to traverse a <code>Seq</code> from every element back to itself I would do the following:</p>  <pre><code>val seq = Seq(1,2,3,4,5)  for (i &lt;- seq.indices) {     for (j &lt;- seq.indices) {         print(seq(i + j % seq.length))     } } </code></pre>  <p>But as I'm looking to <code>fold</code> over the collection, I'm wondering if there is a more idiomatic approach. A recursive approach would allow me to avoid any <code>var</code>s. But basically, I'm wondering if something like the following is possible:</p>  <pre><code>seq.rotatedView(i) </code></pre>  <p>Which would create a rotated view, like rotating bits (or circular shift).</p>
