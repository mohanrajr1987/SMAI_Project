<p>I am coding a program to encrypt phrases using a keyword. Firstly, the user will be asked to enter a keyword of their choice. They will then be asked to enter a phrase they would like to be encrypted. The issue I have is as follows:</p>  <p>If the user's keyword is: hello And their phrase for encryption is: goodbye</p>  <p>The keyword has to be iterated so that the full word for encryption, 'goodbye' can be encrypted. For example:</p>  <pre> hellohe goodbye </pre>  <p>How do I iterate the String so that only 'h' and 'e' are iterated again? </p>
