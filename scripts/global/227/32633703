<p>I am running simulations in Anylogic and I'm trying to calibrate the following distribution:</p>  <pre><code>Jump = normal(coef1, coef2, -1, 1); </code></pre>  <p>However, I keep getting the following message as soon as I start the calibration (experimentation):</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Random number generation requires too many iterations (> 10000)</p> </blockquote>  <p>I tried to replace -1 and 1 by other values and keep getting the same thing.<br> I also tried to change the bounds of <code>coef1</code> and <code>coef2</code> and put things like <code>[0,1]</code>, but I still get the same error.</p>  <p>I don't get it. Any ideas?</p>
