<pre><code>start_list = [5, 3, 1, 2, 4]  for i in start_list:     start_list.append(i**2) </code></pre>  <p>I was under the assumption that value of each list item is assigned to i while the iteration happens.</p>  <p>But given that the code above never completes - it looks like the list is being infinitely appended.</p>  <p>Why does this happen?</p>  <p>How could I properly write this so that It squares each element using the append function.</p>
