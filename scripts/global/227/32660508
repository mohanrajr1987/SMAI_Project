<p>lets say i have as a string the following page:</p>  <pre><code>X &lt;- "http://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-for-sale/Glasgow.html?sortType=6&amp;maxPrice=50000&amp;displayPropertyType=flats&amp;numberOfPropertiesPerPage=50&amp;index=0" </code></pre>  <p>now i would like to iterate it by the last adjacent element </p>  <p><code>"index=0"</code>.</p>  <p>It will be incremented by 50 at every iteration lets say until 500. So I am having 11 strings now with the differences at the end:</p>  <pre><code>"index=0" "index=50" "index=100" ... "index=500" </code></pre>  <p>My question is how to nicely and quickly store each string to the same variable so after finish I could use that variable as an parameter for further data extraction by doing greps, gsubs and regexps ? I mean I want to download the whole page source by each of that string which is simply a pointer to a website.</p>
