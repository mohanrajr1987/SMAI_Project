<p>I have a iterative cuda program which iterates new values as required. It is a confidential code so I cant share, but I want to discuss the problem.</p>  <p>The iterative program runs properly on my PC when I work with less data. I have proper allocation and deallocation codes.</p>  <p>No matter how many times I run the program it runs properly with less data.</p>  <p>But in case of huge data, It runs properly one time but not multiple times providing an error "****.exe has stopped working.....". Same error persists until I restart the PC...each time. It is not feasible to restart the PC each time for me to start the program. So What might be the reason behind it?</p>
