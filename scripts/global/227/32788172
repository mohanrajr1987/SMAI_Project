<p>I am creating a simple application where I ask the user to specify which number to iterate to, and how many rows they want outputted. I think I'm really close, but fairly new at this, so I'm sure a little syntax and variable tweaking will get me there. I am creating this in .Net using MVC. I receive an error upon running because "x" and "y" names do not show up. Here is what I have: </p>  <pre><code>&lt;body&gt; &lt;div&gt;       @{           var numCount = x;         var colCount = y;           for (int i = 1; i &lt; numCount; i++)         {             &lt;span&gt;@i&lt;/span&gt;              if (i % colCount == 0)             {                 &lt;br /&gt;                     &lt;form id="myForm"&gt;                         How many numbers would you like to iterate to?                         &lt;br/&gt;                         &lt;input id="x" type="text" name="x" /&gt;                         &lt;br/&gt;                         How many rows would you like in your iteration?                         &lt;br /&gt;                         &lt;input id="y" type="text" name="y" /&gt;                         &lt;br /&gt;                         &lt;input type="submit" value="Calculate!" onsubmit="return i()" /&gt;                     &lt;/form&gt;              }         }        }  &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p></p>
