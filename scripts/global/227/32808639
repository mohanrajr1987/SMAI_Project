<p>Need increment every second item starting from the right in Haskell list but keeping origin order (e.g. <code>reverse</code> is not a case). For example:</p>  <pre><code> f [1, 2, 3] --  [1, 3, 3]   f [1, 2, 3, 4] -- [2, 2, 4, 4] </code></pre>  <p>I've tried something like a following:</p>  <pre><code>fc ([]) = [] fc (x:[]) = [x] fc (x:[y]) = [x+1,y] fc( x:xs ) = fc [x] : ( fc xs ) -- this line is wrong </code></pre>  <p>p.s. Obviously I could reverse (but prefer to understand original task) the list twice and apply something like:</p>  <pre><code>helper (x:y:tail) = [x, y+1] ++ tail fc x = reverse (helper (reverse x) ) </code></pre>
