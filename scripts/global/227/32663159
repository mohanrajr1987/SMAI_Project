<p>I'm using a library that returns a generator.  Is there a way to start at a particular iteration without using multiple <strong>next ()</strong> statement?</p>  <p>In a simple for loop, I could do the following.</p>  <pre><code>array = [2, 5, 1, 4, 3]  for i in array [2:]:     # do something </code></pre>  <p>In a generator, I couldn't do as shown above.  Instead I'll have to use multiple <strong>next ()</strong> statements to start at the 3rd index.  When attempting to do the same as the for loop, I get an error that said, "generator is not scriptable."</p>
