<p>I am using geom_smooth in combination with rlm (robust estimation). By default only 20 iterations are performed which is not enough in some cases, so I wanted to change the number of iterations like the following:</p>  <pre><code>library(MASS) # for rlm() function  ggplot(data) +  geom_jitter(aes(x = value, y = value2, colour = variable)) + geom_smooth(aes(value, value2, colour = "rlm"), method = rlm, maxit = 100) </code></pre>  <p>However, it does not work and rlm is still using only 20 iterations. Can anyone give me a hint what to do?</p>
