<p>been trying to wrap entire code in a comment, how do i do that? i tried #, """, with no success, and as a question, is this even possible? i guess im stacking comments on top of other comments but im sure there is a way, im wrapping this code because i want to keep it in one file along with other projects in the same file but i dont want to activate ALL of the code. here's the code i want to wrap as a comment:</p>  <pre><code>"""Artithmetic expressions"""  addition = 1 + 1; subtraction = 2-1; miltiplication = 2*2; division = 5/3; """5/3 = 1"""  """Variables and Assignment"""  a, b = addition, subtraction; """a = addition, b = subtraction"""  """ prints 2 1""" print a, b   """Strings, indexing strings"""  string1 = "hello world hell"  string2 = string1[2]  """prints 1""" print string2   """string extraction"""  string3 = string1[0:5] """ hello """ print string3   """Finding"""  stringfind1 = string1.find("hell", 4) """ prints 12 """ print stringfind1        """Python 2""" """If statement""" if (3 &lt; 10): print "true"  else: print "false"   """ Logical Operators"""  if (3 and 4 &lt; 10):  print "true" """may use or"""   """Loops, ex prints 10 iterations""" count = 0 while (count &lt; 10): print 'The count is: ', count count = count + 1  print "Good bye!"
