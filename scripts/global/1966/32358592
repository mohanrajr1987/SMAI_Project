<p>I've added facebook comment plugin to my URLs for few months ago with fb:admins setting to moderate comments from URL . Now I want to change moderation mode to fb:app_id based to moderate the comments from my app in Facebook Developer. But it seems facebook still keep setting with fb:admins instead of fb:app_id for my URLs: I can't see any comment from my  app in Facebook developer.</p>  <p>Anyone know how to tell facebook to update moderation mode for existed URLs in their system? Any suggest would be highly appreciated.</p>
