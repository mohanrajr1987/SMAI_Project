<p>While I was watching some dramas, I stumbled upon viki.com. Viki's videos have a comment system inside the video. Here is an example: <a href="http://www.viki.com/videos/1071499v-scholar-who-walks-the-night-episode-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.viki.com/videos/1071499v-scholar-who-walks-the-night-episode-1</a></p>  <p>It appears in the upper left hand corner and users are able to add comments at certain times and it would appear whenever the video plays at that time.</p>  <p>Would HTML5 Video Player be able to do this? Or would it have to be done in flash? I have looked at Video.js. <a href="http://www.videojs.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.videojs.com/</a></p>  <p>I'm not sure if Video.js allows me to customize HTML5 to the point of adding a comment system. </p>  <p>I would like to implement a comment system similar to Vivi's in my videos. Can I make an HTML element containing my comment system and place it inside the video tag with the appropriate CSS and Javascript? Would that allow me to do this?</p>  <p>How would I go about it? I'm open to any suggestions. Thank you.</p>
