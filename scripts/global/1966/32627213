<p>I think there's is a way in sass, to have in the output css file, some comments for each class or tag definition, to get the sass file name (and maybe line) where they are.</p>  <p>for example :</p>  <p>scss file named _common.scss line 15 :</p>  <pre><code>.classname{   margin: 0; } </code></pre>  <p>css file output :</p>  <pre><code>/* _common.scss on line 15 */ .classname{   margin: 0; } </code></pre>  <p>Hope that i'm clear... Thanks for your help and sorry for my poor english. :)</p>  <p>X.</p>
