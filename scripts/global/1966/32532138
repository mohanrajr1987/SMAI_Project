<p>This is a silly question.</p>  <p>I've used Visual Studio extensively in the past for developing applications in C#. With C#, I know I can enter '///' to automatically generate some doc comments. Right now, I'm using the python tools for Visual Studio. Is there a way to accomplish the same sort of comment automatically for python? I can't seem to find any settings for this. </p>  <p>Thanks in advance! </p>
