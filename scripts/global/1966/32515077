<p>I apologize if commenting seems like a trivial question. But as AngularJS developers, how do you guys usually comment your angular <code>.run</code> and <code>.config</code> blocks? </p>  <pre><code>var app = angular.module('MyApp');  /**  * @ngdoc function  * @description  * Does something.   */ app.run(function() {  })  /**  * @ngdoc function  * @description  * Does something.   */ .config(function() {  }); </code></pre>  <p>This is what I tried, but the function value of the @ngdoc annotation doesn't work. When I ran <code>grunt ngdocs</code>, I got the following error from the command line, </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Warning: Cannot read property 'split' of undefined Use --force to   continue.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Any tips on styling guide for commenting these blocks? </p>  <p>Many thanks. </p>
