<p>I've created a excel sheet to replicate a desk plan of an office, using comment display boxes <code>filled with picture</code> to display mugshots on mouse-overs.</p>  <p>I painstakingly sized them to <code>4.5cm x 4cm</code> via format object. But since some minor alterations the sizing had changed.</p>  <p>I found that using VBA people have done a mass size change for a 'Autofit', thought I could tailor it to a fixed size to save me time.</p>  <p>This is what I have, <code>*4.5cm x 4cm*</code> being the area in question, unless it's all in need of change, help?</p>  <pre><code>Sub FitComments()     Dim xComment As Comment     For Each xComment In Application.ActiveSheet.Comments         xComment.Shape.TextFrame.Size = * 4.5cm x 4cm *     Next End Sub </code></pre>
