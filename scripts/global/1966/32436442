<p>Almost every CLIPS construct has an optional <em>comment</em> section which can hold some string-like text. I am wondering if this can actually be somehow used.</p>  <pre><code>(defrule already-very-informative-rule-name "    Hi,    I wrote this rule late saturday evening having some beer and relaxed.    So the story starts ...    ...    "    (pattern)    =&gt;    (action) ) </code></pre>  <p>Is there a way to extract a list of methods/rules with their comments? Maybe like automatically generated documentation in Python? </p>  <p>Or are these positional comments just for some unique fancy style of writing inline comments in CLIPS?</p>
