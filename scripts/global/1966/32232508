<p>Currently I am having an issue with removing links from a user comment. So far this is the code:    </p>  <pre><code>= simple_format(comment.body) </code></pre>  <p>The simple format allows paragraph tags and it removes iframes but it does not remove link tags such as:</p>  <pre><code>(&lt;a href="test.com"&gt;test&lt;/a&gt;) </code></pre>  <p>The reason why I want to remove links from the view code and not the model/controller side is that their are different comments that I do want to have links available on. </p>
