<p>I've usually used Sublime Text for editing JavaScript files, there I can toggle comments with <code>Ctrl+Shift+7|/</code>.</p>  <p>Now I'm trying VSCode, which is a great project. But I failed in toggling comments per shortcut. The documentation says: <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/keybindings" rel="nofollow">Ctrl+K and the like</a>, but this did not work.</p>  <p>Any suggestions?</p>  <hr>  <p>I'm using Ubuntu 14 with Gnome.</p>
