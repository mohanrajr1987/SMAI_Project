<p>I would like the functionality that exists in WordPress.Com for the comments link at the bottom of an article in an RSS feed.</p>  <p>I see this in two different blogs and it is not theme related. It has to be in the core WP code base.</p>  <p>Examples: <a href="https://emshort.wordpress.com/feed/" rel="nofollow">https://emshort.wordpress.com/feed/</a> <a href="https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/feed/" rel="nofollow">https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/feed/</a></p>  <p>In both cases, a comments link is appended to the article in the RSS feed. This link does not exist in the article itself.</p>  <p>The pattern is (from the second blog feed):</p>  <pre><code>&lt;a rel="nofollow"  ref="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/1943/"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/1943/" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com&amp;blog=63930094&amp;post=1943&amp;subd=heterogenoustasks&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" height="1" /&gt; </code></pre>  <p>The image is a favicon from feeds.wordpress.com that shows either "Add a Comment" (as an image) or "Comments: ##" (also as an image) and the link takes you to the blog comments section directly.</p>  <p>I'm guessing this is a hack in the feeds-rss2.php code, but am unsure what to put there to achieve the same results.</p>  <p>Note that I've asked the WordPress.Com and WordPress.org folks for help and .Com sends me to .Org and .Org Forums gives me non-answer answers.</p>  <p>Maybe someone on SO can help out...</p>
