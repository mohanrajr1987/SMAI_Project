<p>I added facebook comments on my site but I still can't moderate it. I did everything like most pages advise. First of all I created application and made it public. Then I put SDK script from <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/comments" rel="nofollow">here</a>. (there is an 'app id' inside the script) and put </p>  <pre><code>&lt;div class="fb-comments" data-href="&lt;?php echo get_permalink( $post-&gt;ID ); ?&gt;" data-numposts="5"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>to my <code>content.php</code> file in wordpress site (so every post will have comments). </p>  <p>After all I added to head section </p>  <pre><code>&lt;meta property="fb:admins" content="{xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx}"/&gt; </code></pre>  <p>which 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx' is my facebook id. (I also tried with 'app id' way). However I can't modify comments. Also I can't see any comments when I go to <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/tools/comments/" rel="nofollow">facebook comments</a>. </p>  <p>It seems like facebook doesn't connect my site with this app.</p>
