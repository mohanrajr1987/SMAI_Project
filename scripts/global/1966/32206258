<p>Lets assume you have 2 website versions that share single database: a mobile version and a desktop version of your main website. Their URLs differ significantly.</p>  <p>Is it possible to implement the same Facebook plugin (using one the same Facebook app) on each of them? What I need to achieve is to show same comments below same articles no matter that their URLs differ.</p>  <p>Sample URLs for one article:</p>  <p>1) On the desktop version: <a href="https://www.somesite.com/somepath/article1" rel="nofollow">https://www.somesite.com/somepath/article1</a> 2) On the mobile version: <a href="https://m.somesite.com/differentpath/article1" rel="nofollow">https://m.somesite.com/differentpath/article1</a></p>  <p>They show the same content but totally differ as URL. So they should include the same comments. Is that doable with a single Facebook app?</p>
