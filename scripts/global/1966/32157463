<p>I'm looking for a way to create documentation crossreferences within pydoc comments, working similar to an anchor in html.</p>  <p>Imagine the following scenario:</p>  <pre><code>class SomeClass:   """ Class description followed by a [assign anchor=1]detailed         explanation of certain input file formats required by the class        [/assign anchor]"""   def __init__(self, inputFile)   """ Constructor description...        :param input file: file compliant with the format described in [1]""" </code></pre>  <p>So rather than copy/past repeating the part where the input file format is described from the class description I'd like to link back from the constructor (and other member's) comments to the part of the class description describing the input file format. Clicking the [1] in the constructor parameter description should jump to the part of the general class description that has been assigned "anchor 1".</p>
