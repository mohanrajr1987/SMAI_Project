<p>I wanted to know if you knew a command or a way to write as comment or string inside of the executable file. Indeed I already did this, with <em>XLC</em> compiler I did it with the <code>#pragma comment(user, "string")</code> however now I have to change to <em>GCC</em> but there's a problem, under <em>GCC</em> this <code>#pragma</code> is not recognized.</p>  <p>My question is, do you know another <code>#pragma</code> who can do it under gcc, or just another way to process to recover an information written in the executable file when I compile.</p>  <p>Thanks, EÅ¾ekiel</p>
