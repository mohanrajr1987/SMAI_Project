<p>I've been going through the old questions regarding Disqus comment counts but I am sorry it doesn't make a lot of sense to me. I have a blog ( <a href="http://www.godyears.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.godyears.net/</a> ) to which I have recently added Disqus. When I enter an individual page, it shows me the comment count at the end of the post. But there are two basic things not happening: 1. On the home page, it does not display the number of comments. 2. On Blogger itself, it shows the comments count as zero for each post. </p>  <p>I really would like to have both these corrected and honestly would appreciate some help here. I don't have a great knowledge of html so don't even know what code to showcase here from the blog to ask for help. Any kind Disqus-knowing Samaritans around? </p>
