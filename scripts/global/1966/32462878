<p>To clarify first, I already have a compression tool that successfully compresses EVERYTHING else so I don't need a long complicated <code>preg_replace</code> regex, just a simple <code>preg_replace</code> or <code>str_replace</code> rule will do.</p>  <p>I ONLY want to remove JavaScript comments that start with "// " (including the space so I don't erase URLs) up until the new line. THAT'S IT! Once again, I don't need to replace /* */ or any other variations as I have a script that does that already; the only thing it's missing is this one feature so I want to clean up the input with this first, then hand it over to the script.</p>  <p>Here are screenshots with examples of comments I would like to remove:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/dMDMx.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/dMDMx.png" alt="Screenshot 1"></a> <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/M8UTq.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/M8UTq.png" alt="Screenshot 2"></a></p>  <p>I would really appreciate help with this! :-) THANKS!</p>
