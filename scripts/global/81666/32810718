<p>I'm getting this error only the first time the app is opened</p>  <pre><code>Registration to GCM failed with error: The operation couldnâ€™t be completed. (com.google.iid error 7.) </code></pre>  <p>If I try to run the app again, Im able to register and get a token and receive the push messages.</p>  <p>I already tried the solution on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30737406/unable-to-register-com-google-iid-error-1005">unable to register (com.google.iid error 1005.)</a></p>  <p>But still having the problem.</p>  <p>Any idea of how can I fix that?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
