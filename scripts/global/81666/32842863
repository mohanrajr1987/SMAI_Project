<p>I am new to Android programming. Could you please help us understand what happens if my server sends a "ping" - Send to Sync GCM to a user (app) but user has turned off the notification for the app off in the mobile? </p>  <p>I have looked around but didn't find any. Perhaps, my search skill is fading away :) </p>  <p>Really appreciate people. </p>  <p>Cheers, Raj </p>
