<p>In my app, I have some small png images in drawable folder which can be displayed in edittext and textviews.</p>  <p>Right now, I'm able to display these images in edittext and textview.</p>  <p>I have the following scenario: At User1, he can select the image and it gets displayed in the edittext. On clicking a send button, the text inside edittext needs to get sent to User2.</p>  <p>I'm using GCM for sending normal text in between users. </p>  <p>So, how can I represent the image in text format.  What coding should I use? Should I just have drawable image file name prepended by some special characters? </p>  <p>For example: If image name is e205, then can something like the following be done: <em>"This is normal text, ##e205 previous is image"</em></p>  <p>Like I used ## in this case, what can be used for identifying that following word is actually an image filename and not normal text?</p>  <p>When User2 gets this message, only the coded part of text should get converted back to image, and get displayed in a textview.</p>
