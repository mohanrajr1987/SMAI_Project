<p>Sometimes when I receive a normal-priority GCM message in my Android app the network doesn't seem to be available. Do normal-priority GCM messages automatically grant an app temporary exemptions to Android M's new <a href="http://developer.android.com/training/monitoring-device-state/doze-standby.html" rel="nofollow">Doze and App Standby</a> sleep conditions (namely restricting network access)?</p>  <p>Full Context: I've implemented an App prior to Android-M's release that uses a GCM messaging to tickle installed app instances to download updates on-demand. This is a <a href="http://developer.android.com/training/efficient-downloads/regular_updates.html" rel="nofollow">best practice</a> over polling for updates.</p>  <p>Android-M introduces Doze and AppStandby which seem able to restrict network access when apps aren't using the the <a href="https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/concept-options#setting-the-priority-of-a-message" rel="nofollow">new high-priority</a> message type.</p>  <p>Should I switch these tickle messages to high-priority or will I have network access when I receive normal-priority messages? My testing with Android M Previews seems to indicate the network sometimes isn't available. </p>
