<p>I know have many question like my question. But It is different. I make a Android app using GCM to push notification. It have problem.</p>  <p>When I install app, I got <code>regId</code> of this install. I store it in mysql. Then I push notification and My device receives this notification. </p>  <p>However, After I uninstall app then install again, I got <code>regId</code> another and store it in mysql. I push notification to all <code>regId</code> I stored in mysql. And now My device receives this notification two times.</p>  <p>Repeat again step above many times. I got many <code>regId</code> another and store them into mysql. Then push notification to all <code>regId</code> I stored in mysql. Now My device receives the notification by the time I installed app.</p>  <p>I tried unregister <code>regId</code> when uninstall app but it can not. Is there any suggestion to unregister <code>redId</code> when I uninstall app or do anything solve my problem?</p>
