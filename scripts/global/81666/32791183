<p>i finally succeede to recieve an gcm notification on my android app which was build using Livecode. Fortunately a good script was on their forum. This works ok, i can receive any text i like and the sound is there....but this script bites my own livecode stack, that it causes my stack to stop communicating with my database via php. The stack i made send a simple text file and at the same time the notifcation should be send out. So i wanted to do this also via php. Now i can send and receive the gcm notification. But there is no sound and the alternative text is not appearing, just 'Notification Recieved'. Also in the Livecode gcm script there is Sound_enable=true used in the JSON part. And i can't find it anywere in any php script. I'm not a php coder nor a JSON coder. So i hope someone can help me out. What i need is to post a text to the gcm.php file so that the user can read this text and that the sound is heard (or maybe even vibration). <a href="http://lessons.runrev.com/m/4069/l/59312-how-do-i-use-push-notifications-with-android" rel="nofollow">The lesson on the LiveCode site</a> is out of date and absolutely not working.</p>  <p>LiveCode uses the following fields to store and process push notification information.</p>  <pre><code>data.body - The message body displayed in the status bar (default: "User  interaction requested"). data.title - The title of the message displayed in the status bar  (default: the app label). data.badge_value - The badged number to display along with the statusbar  message. data.play_sound - A Boolean that indicates whether or not a sound should  be played when the notification is received (true / false). data.payload - The message that is delivered to the app in its  remoteAlert handler.  The JSON part of the livecode script that is working and makes sound:   command pushNotificationAndroid pAPIKey, pDevices, pTitle, pBody,  pBadge, pSound, pPayload     # build data element of notification  put pTitle into tDataA["title"]  put pBody into tDataA["body"]  put pBadge into tDataA["badge_value"]  put pSound = true into tDataA["play_sound"]  put pPayload into tDataA["payload"]  # build notification put tDataA into tNotificationA["data"] split pDevices with LF put pDevices into tNotificationA["registration_ids"] put "Splash21" into tNotificationA["collapse_key"]  # create a JSON encoded message jsonEncode tNotificationA, tNotification  # headers put "Content-Type: application/json" &amp; LF into tHeaders put "Authorization: key=" &amp; pAPIKey &amp; LF after tHeaders set the HTTPHeaders to tHeaders  # had a couple of errors that were resolved  by                               setting/resetting             this        flag  :/ libUrlSetSSLVerification false  # send the notification post tNotification to url "https://android.googleapis.com/gcm/send" return it  end pushNotificationAndroid    # encode array in JSON format  command jsonEncode @pArray, @pJson, pDeep  if pDeep = empty then put empty into pJson   put the keys of pArray into tKeys  repeat for each key tKey in pArray   if tKey is not an integer then      put true into tTextKeys      exit repeat   end if  end repeat  if tTextKeys then   put "{" into tOpen   put "}" into tClose  else   put "[" into tOpen   put "]" into tClose end if put tOpen after pJson put 0 into tIndex repeat for each line tKey in tKeys   add 1 to tIndex   if tIndex &gt; 1 then put comma after pJson   if tTextKeys then put quote &amp; tKey &amp; quote &amp; colon after pJson   put pArray[tKey] into tVal   if tVal is an array then      jsonEncode tVal, pJson, true   else if tVal is a number or tVal  is a boolean then      put tVal after pJson   else if tVal = empty then      put "null" after pJson   else      replace quote with "\" in tVal      replace "\" with "\\" in tVal      replace "/" with "\/" in tVal      replace numToChar(8) with "\b" in tVal      replace numToChar(9) with "\t" in tVal      replace numToChar(10) with "\n" in tVal      replace numToChar(12) with "\f" in tVal      replace numToChar(13) with "\r" in tVal      repeat for each item tCode in                                      "0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,11,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,    23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31"         replace numToChar(tCode) with "\u" &amp; format("%04X", tCode)           in        tVal      end repeat      put quote &amp; tVal &amp; quote after pJson   end if end repeat put tClose after pJson end jsonEncode </code></pre>  <p>this info above is nowhere to be found on any Livecode webpage except for    the androidgcm stack created by Splash. So were he got the info from,  god knows.</p>  <p>and this is partly a php scripts that worked, but do not give sound nor the text of the message is seen. So i just see the icon appear and the stand text.(the original script worked only for receiving a standard notification without sound etc, i adjusted the php script to fullfill my needs, but it is now totally not working, neither giving an error)</p>  <pre><code>  //  Multi gcm Send   &lt;?php  $collapse_key = $_POST["collapse_key"];   $body = $_POST["body"];  $play_sound = true  $payload = $_POST["payload"];  $title = $_POST["title"];  $badge_value = $_POST["badge_value"];   //if(isset($_POST['submit'])){   $con = mysql_connect("localhost", "blabla","password");    if(!$con){     die('MySQL connection failed');    }    $db = mysql_select_db("database");   if(!$db){    die('Database selection failed');   }    $registration_ids = array();   $sql = "SELECT * FROM gcmusers";   $result = mysql_query($sql, $con);   while($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($result)){    array_push($registration_ids, $row['gcmregid']);   }     // Set POST variables---notification was Notice 'body' =&gt; $abstract,      $url = 'https://android.googleapis.com/gcm/send';     $message = array('collapse_key' =&gt; $collapse_key,       'data' =&gt; array('body' =&gt; $body,     'play_sound' =&gt; $play_sound,    'payload' =&gt; $payload,    'badge_value' =&gt; $badge_value),    $fields = array(    'registration_ids' =&gt; $registration_ids,    )    );        $headers = array(          'Authorization: key=abcde4dJfabcdeCX1W-FsY83abcededGdcc',          'Content-Type: application/json'      );      // Open connection      $ch = curl_init();       // Set the url, number of POST vars, POST data      curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $url);       curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);      curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, $headers);      curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);       // Disabling SSL Certificate support temporarly      curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, false);       curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, json_encode($fields));       // Execute post      $result = curl_exec($ch);      if ($result === FALSE) {          die('Curl failed: ' . curl_error($ch));      }       // Close connection      curl_close($ch);      echo $result;    }    ?&gt;  </code></pre>  <p>So there is something that the app created by livecode misses somehow.</p>  <p>How can i adjust this php script so that it can receive the message i want to sent and that it makes sound, by maybe adapting the commands the livecode-json script uses?</p>  <p>Thanks for any help on this. I know it is a long story but i searched really a lot and tried dozens of things.</p>
