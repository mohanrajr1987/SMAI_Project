Logic:</p>  <ul> <li>when i login, server returns me <code>GCM_SENDER_ID</code></li> <li>then i need to register GCM with that id</li> </ul>  <p>but i get error 401</p>  <pre><code>Registration to GCM failed with error: The operation couldnâ€™t be completed. (com.google.HTTPStatus error 401.) </code></pre>  <p>This is example: I have 2 domains, 2 web apps, and i made 2 apps in Google Console for gcm, second app can't see push messages from first app. Then for ios i have manager app that can connect to GCM with <code>GCM_SENDER_ID</code> from first and seccond web app, with different id.</p>  <p>Now i have 3 apps in google console:</p>  <ul> <li>app1</li> <li>app2</li> <li>manager app(for certificates)</li> </ul>  <p>How can i use dynamic <code>GCM_SENDER_ID</code> for manager app?</p>  <p>When i login to <code>app1</code> server returns me <code>GCM_SENDER_ID</code> and then i use it to register gcm on ios, but getting that error 401.</p>
