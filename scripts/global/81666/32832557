<p>I am able to send a message to a Chrome Web App using GCM.  I am using a http post to:  <a href="https://android.googleapis.com/gcm/send" rel="nofollow">https://android.googleapis.com/gcm/send</a>  sending registrationid, applicationid, and senderid values.  The message shows as a Chrome Notification on my screen.  My question is - is there a command or a GCM event/function I can use to start the Chrome Web App?  Google Chrome is set to run in the background. </p>
