<p>I have a class extendng GcmListenerService and implementing <code>onMessageReceived(String from, Bundle data)</code> method. I am able to receive the push notification and in <code>onMessageReceived</code> method, I need to start a service.</p>  <p>I need a context to start the service:</p>  <pre><code>context.startService(new Intent(context, MyService.class)); </code></pre>  <p>I have tried BaseContext, ApplicationContext and current service reference(this), but none of them are able to start the service. I came to know that GcmListenerService gets killed once <code>onMessageReceived</code> is called.</p>
