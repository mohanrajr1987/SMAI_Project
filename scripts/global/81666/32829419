<p>I have GCM (Google Cloud Messaging) XMPP connection running with Android app clients and Ubuntu server. The server documentation (<a href="https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/ccs" rel="nofollow">https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/ccs</a>) discusses differences between release (gcm-xmpp.googleapis.com:5235) and pre-productions (gcm-preprod.googleapis.com:5236) GCM connections from server. However, the wording in the section states the messaging is routed from to the server according to the SENDER_ID rather than the URL:port the server has registered at:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The CCS XMPP endpoint runs at gcm-xmpp.googleapis.com:5235. When testing functionality (with non-production users), you should instead connect to gcm-preprod.googleapis.com:5236 (note the different port). Regular testing on preprod (a smaller environment where the latest CCS builds run) is beneficial both for isolating real users from test code, as well as for early detection of unexpected behavior changes. Note that a connection receives upstream messages destined for its GCM sender ID, regardless of which environment (gcm or gcm-preprod) it is connected to. Therefore, test code connecting to gcm-preprod.googleapis.com:5236 should use a different GCM sender ID to avoid upstream messages from production traffic being sent over test connections.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Since the SENDER_ID is the Project Number, does this imply I need to create a second version of the project with GCM enabled to run production and pre-production versions of my GCM 3rdp party server concurrently?</p>
