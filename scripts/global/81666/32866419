<p>I am using the <a href="https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/network-manager" rel="nofollow">GCM network manager</a> and I want to pass the service (specifically to the <code>onRunTask(TaskParams taskParams)</code> some objects. From the documentation <a href="https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/gcm/TaskParams" rel="nofollow">taskParams</a> are simply a string and a bundle but I want to pass more complex objects. </p>  <p>How can this be done?</p>  <p>Thank you!</p>
