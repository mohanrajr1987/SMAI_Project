<p>I'm planning to use Google Cloud Messaging in order to let users be notified when their own server has an alert to send.</p>  <p>In this perspective, they will have to install a small script that will be called by a service on their server: it will use Google Cloud Messaging to send a message that will finally be displayed on their Android device:</p>  <pre><code>Server(script) -&gt; Google Cloud Messaging -&gt; Device </code></pre>  <p>The downside is that my Google Cloud Messaging API key will be shared with my users since it will be unencrypted in the script on their server.</p>  <p>Documentation states that </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Note: Note the API key displayed when you configure your project, <strong>and store it securely</strong> on your app server. You'll need it to send downstream messages to the client app.</p> </blockquote>  <hr>  <p>So here's my question: should I share this API key publicly or should I use an intermediate script:</p>  <pre><code>Server(script) -&gt; "proxy" -&gt; Google Cloud Messaging -&gt; Device </code></pre>  <p>Is there any way spammers could use this API key to send unwanted notifications to my users?</p>
