<p>I have an Android Wear app which was working fine on my Moto360. It access Google Play Services and GCM APIs in the Google Admin console. Then I tried to use another watch (LG G Watch). Because I can only pair one watch at any time with my phone, I had to "forget" the moto360 in order to pair with the LG G Watch. Now I cannot seem to connect to Google App API (GCM or play services). I am getting the following error:</p>  <pre><code>I/GMPM    ( 2746): App measurement is starting up E/GMPM    ( 2746): getGoogleAppId failed with status: 10 E/GMPM    ( 2746): Uploading is not possible. App measurement disabled </code></pre>  <p>This error occurs in the logcat of both the watch and the accompanying mobile app. I tried looking up what the status code but could not find any info. Could anyone please help in gleaning what this status code mean? Thanks</p>
