<p>I'm trying register a service worker in Ruby On Rails to implement a push notification GCM. But nothing happens. Please, see my code below:</p>  <pre><code>if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {     navigator.serviceWorker.register('/assets/service-worker.js')     .then(initialiseState);   } else {     window.Demo.debug.log('Service workers aren\'t supported in this browser.'); </code></pre>  <p>This part works fine. But, when I call <code>navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then(function(serviceWorkerRegistration)</code>, nothing happens.</p>  <p>I was searching on search engine and there are few things to help me.</p>  <p>Can anybody help me ?</p>
