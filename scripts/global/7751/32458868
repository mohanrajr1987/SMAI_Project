<p>I am new to access database. I have a Payroll Table with several fields. In that table whenever I insert a new row in to that table, I want to display netpay field to be filled automatically. I want to calculate    </p>  <pre><code> [Grosspay] - [OtherExpenses].  </code></pre>  <p>Im  Googled and saw many examples but I am not getting the exact one  what I wanted. In one example I found changing the datatype of automated calculated field to Calculated datatype. But in my database I don't find that.  I am using access 2007</p>
