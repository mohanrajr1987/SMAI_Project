<p>I have a access db that have this kind of data and I would like to write a query that will output the combined rows. I have looked into joins and other things but don't really grasp how they can do what I want. </p>  <pre><code>Person   Company    Item1   Item2  Item3   1        A          5          2        A                  3 3        A                         4 4        B          3             5        B                  2 6        B                         1 </code></pre>  <p>Combine it to</p>  <pre><code>Company       Item1   Item2   Item3 A             5       3       4 B             3       2       1  </code></pre>  <p>It is supposed to be only one Item1 per Company and I realize there might be an issue if I have double. But that is another problem. </p>
