<p>I am currently looking to do something which I assume to be super simple but am currently missing for some reason or another.  I have 2 tables one is a list of all company drivers and another is a list of the most recent incidents for the drivers.  I am looking to make a query to take a list of drivers and show if they have an incident or not. The query I have now will only show the drivers that have an incident and not the ones that do not.  I am assuming it has something to do with my joins.</p>  <p><code>SELECT DriverProfile.DriverID, DriverProfile.FirstName, DriverProfile.LastName, dbo_manpowerprofile.mpp_senioritydate AS [Seniority Date], Last(Incidents.[Event Date]) AS [Incident Date] FROM (DriverProfile LEFT JOIN dbo_manpowerprofile ON DriverProfile.DriverID = dbo_manpowerprofile.mpp_id) LEFT JOIN Incidents ON DriverProfile.DriverID = Incidents.Driver WHERE (((Incidents.Type)&lt;&gt;"OBS") AND ((Incidents.Preventability)&lt;&gt;"TNP" And (Incidents.Preventability)&lt;&gt;"NTNP") AND ((DriverProfile.ActiveYN)="Y")) GROUP BY DriverProfile.DriverID, DriverProfile.FirstName, DriverProfile.LastName, dbo_manpowerprofile.mpp_senioritydate;</code></p>
