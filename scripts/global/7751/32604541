<p>I have a form with a 2-page tab control.</p>  <p>The first page has a subform with a button on the subform that's supposed to requery another subform that is on the second page.</p>  <pre class="lang-vb prettyprint-override"><code>Forms!myMainForm!mySubForm.Requery </code></pre>  <p>The main form and its fields are used to create new records and the subform on the second page shows these records.</p>  <p>Here's a screenshot of page 1's subform and button:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/RLsgcSi.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i.imgur.com/RLsgcSi.jpg</a></p>  <p>When the button is clicked, the subform on the second page shows any new record at the bottom of the list instead of being sorted in descending date/time order. Also the Funding Rate field does not seem to get its conditional formatting applied:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/QRvI5fy.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i.imgur.com/QRvI5fy.jpg</a></p>  <p>I've been able to get the subform to display correctly if I also add some VBA to the button to switch to the second page of the tab, but I'd rather not do this.</p>  <p>Is it possible to requery a subform and have it display correctly when the user is ready to see it?</p>
