<p>I have a little code of mine where I put few text fields from form into db. I need to combine 3 text fields so they will be inserted into one field in table separated with a comma and i can't figure out the way to connect it.</p>  <p>Let's say i have test fields:</p>  <p>txtFieldOne, txtFieldTwo, txtFieldThree and i want to put them separated by commas into one table column, like:</p>  <pre><code>INSERT INTO dbtable (combinedValuesOfTextFieldOneTwoAndThree) VALUES (txtFieldOne + txtFieldTwo + txtFieldThree); </code></pre>
