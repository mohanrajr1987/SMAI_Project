<p>In MS Access I need to exclude a LARGE list of words (table-B) if they are contained anywhere (partial match) within Table-A. I know how to use IS NULL with wildcard but this will not work as my list is well over 1,000 records to exclude. See Example Below... <br><br> TABLE-A:<br> best red apples here<br> best ripe apples here<br> <br> TABLE-B:<br> red apples<br> <br> QUERY1 (RESULTS):<br> best ripe apples here<br></p>  <p>NOTE: I'm using MS Access 2007</p>
