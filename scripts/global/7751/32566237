<p>I have a problem with tables linked to BE database. </p>  <p>Opening the table on FE database with linked tables by specific user locks the BE database for others, even for read. </p>  <p>An error Run-time 3045 comes when somebody wants to use a linked table. Same as open BE database by msaccess, "Cannot block the file", and open .laccdb - "Permission denied"</p>  <p>Every user have same rights.</p>
