<p>I am using a form's Current event to pull data from its OpenArgs property in order to pre-populate a few of the empty fields for the current record. </p>  <p>The Current event VBA is illustrated below (it's the <code>pullData</code> sub that brings this new data in to the current record):</p>  <pre class="lang-vb prettyprint-override"><code>Private Sub Form_Current()      If _         SplitOpenArg(6) = "NewAssessment" _     Then                 pullData         EditMode     Else         ViewMode     End If  End Sub </code></pre>  <p>Elsewhere on the form I have a command button that branches in to an option for the user to delete/discard the current record displayed on the form:</p>  <pre class="lang-vb prettyprint-override"><code>Dim db As DAO.Database Dim sql As String  Set db = CurrentDb     sql = "DELETE * FROM myTable WHERE ID='" &amp; Me.ID &amp; "'"     db.Execute sql  Set db = Nothing  DoCmd.Close acForm, "myForm" </code></pre>  <p>When a record is deleted this way, it seems the Current event of the form is triggered... I suppose this is by design; Access moves to another record if the current one has been deleted. </p>  <p>Unfortunately for me though this means the <code>pullData</code> sub is run again and so partially re-creates the record the user is trying to delete.</p>  <p>I've tried <code>DoCmd.RunCommand acCmdDeleteRecord</code>, but that causes the same issue.</p>  <p>Is it possible to delete a record from a form's Record Source without then triggering the form's current event?</p>  <p>I could potentially close the form and delete the record in a module separate to the form, but would be interested if this can be achieved from the form module itself.</p>
