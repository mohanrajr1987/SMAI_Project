<p>In my information management system made in <strong>MS Access 2007</strong>, I want the quantity of item to be deducted automatically when the sale is made. How can I do this?</p>  <p>Below is the class diagram description:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Class 'sale' has 'sale_id[PK]' attribute and is related (1 to M) to the class 'sale_details' having attributes 'item_id [PF]', 'sale_id[PF]' and 'quantity'.</p>      <p>'sale_details' is related (1 to M) to the class 'item' having attributes 'item_id[PK]' and 'quantity'.</p> </blockquote>
