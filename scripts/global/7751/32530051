<p>I have the following data that I am trying to pull the record with the most recent incident date. However I am unable to get the query to work correctly using first,last, max, or min. </p>  <p>Here is an example of the data. I am looking to pull the most recent date from.  It should also be noted that if a particular ID has no incidents I still need the ID to show in the result. </p>  <pre><code>`ID     FirstName LastName srp_ID Incident Date Preventability mpp_senioritydate xxxxxx  James     Naismith                                    5/16/2010                                  xxxxxx  John      Smith                                       7/22/2006                  xxxxxx  John      Smith    2396                               7/22/2006                 xxxxxx  John      Smith    2240                               7/22/2006 xxxxxx  John      Smith    1140   2/15/2010 10:00:00    TP    7/22/2006 xxxxxx  John      Smith    1206   5/19/2010 07:40:00    NTP   7/22/2006` </code></pre>
