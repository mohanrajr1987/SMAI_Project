<p>I am trying to update a field of my table1 using the following code but I receive the following error message:3073 operation must use an updateable query.</p>  <pre class="lang-sql prettyprint-override"><code>UPDATE table1 a  INNER JOIN (SELECT COUNT(somevalue) AS Total,ID  FROM ReadsPNPA GROUP BY ID) b  ON a.ID=b.ID  SET a.Total = b.Total  </code></pre>  <p>Any ideas? the subselect query works on its own. </p>
