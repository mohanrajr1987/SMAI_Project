<p>I have a main form with a subform. The main form is bound to a table, which has a primary key of <code>ID1</code> and a foreign key of <code>ID2</code>.</p>  <p>The main form / subform relationship is set up on <code>ID2</code>, so the main form will show 1 record at a time, and then the subform will show all related records that match <code>ID2</code> for the current record on the main form.</p>  <p>I'm trying to use a command button within the subform records so that I can move the main form to that particular record in the subform using the <code>ID1</code> field:</p>  <pre class="lang-vb prettyprint-override"><code>Private Sub cmdLoadAssess_Click()      Dim rs As DAO.Recordset     Dim frm As Form      Set frm = Me.Parent     Set rs = frm.RecordsetClone      rs.FindFirst "ID1=" &amp; Me.ID1      If _         Not rs.NoMatch _     Then                 Debug.Print "Match found for " &amp; Me.ID1         frm.Bookmark = rs.Bookmark               Else                 Debug.Print "No match found for " &amp; Me.ID1           End If  End Sub </code></pre>  <p>Unfortunately this seems to only be able to find a match on <code>ID1</code> for the current record in the main form (which is pointless, since the main form is already there!)</p>  <p>I know these records exists (they're right there in subform), and those <code>Debug.Print</code> lines tell me <code>ID1</code> is being passed from the subform. What am I missing here?</p>  <p><strong>Edit:</strong> After doing a <code>rs.MoveLast</code> and then checking the cloned recordset's <code>rs.RecordCount</code> and <code>rs!ID</code>, it seems that only the current record on the main form has been cloned for the recordset rather than the whole table that the main form is bound to. Why is it not cloning the whole recordset of the main form?</p>
