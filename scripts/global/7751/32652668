<p>I have a problem do after the first record. I write a lot of empty fields. Does anyone have any idea how to change it. this is code:</p>  <p>Option Compare Database Private Sub Save_New_Store_Click()</p>  <pre><code>Dim rst As Recordset Dim strRst As String Dim iLastID As Integer  strRst = "SELECT * " &amp; _         "FROM StoreNew"  Set rst = CurrentDb.OpenRecordset(strRst, dbOpenDynaset)  If IsNull(Me!txtStoreName) Then         MsgBox "Store Name cannot be left blank"         Cancel = True         Me!txtStoreName.SetFocus      Exit Sub  End If  iLastID = 0  If rst.EOF = False Then     rst.MoveLast     iLastID = rst!StoreNewID End If  rst.AddNew     rst!StoreNewID = iLastID + 1     rst!StoreName = Me!txtStoreName.Value rst.Update  MsgBox "The New Store was created successfully.", vbOKOnly  rst.Close  Me.Refresh  ClearFields </code></pre>  <p>End Sub Sub ClearFields()     Me!txtStoreName.Value = "" End Sub</p>  <p>thanks in advance</p>
