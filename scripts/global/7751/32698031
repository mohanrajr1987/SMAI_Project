<p>I have a Access Table with following structure:</p>  <pre><code>INO   IDATE      NAME ADDRESS CITY PHONE CONTACT &amp; Other Fields..... 1430  01-Apr-15  1431 01-Apr-15  1432 01-Apr-15  1435 01-Apr-15  1436 01-Apr-15  1440 01-Apr-15  1441 01-Apr-15  1448 01-Apr-15  1450 01-Apr-15  1455 02-Apr-15  1456 02-Apr-15  1459 02-Apr-15  </code></pre>  <p>Field "INO" is set To Data type "NUMBER" Field Size: Double Indexed= Yes</p>  <p>This field is auto increment programmatically, but after deletion of some useless &amp; cancelled records from database. INo. series is not in order. I want to re generate the numbers &amp; fill the gap of deleted numbers. i.e. INO 1435 should be 1433, 1436 to 1434, 1440 to 1435 &amp; so on.</p>  <p>Select Statement i use to filter records from table:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT * FROM IDETAIL WHERE TYPE=True AND INO&gt;=1430 ORDER BY INO; </code></pre>  <p>Till 1430 records are in order there is gap after 1430 &amp; dated 01-Apr-15. there are about 18,000 records in table so not easy to manually correct the records. How can i correct this with SQL or any other command.</p>  <p>P.S. : No related table or entry is effected. We just want to maintain the sequence of entries for accounting purpose.</p>  <p>Just like we use "Do While" function. Starting entry INo is correct and known. All the entries got numbered in a loop starting with 1st record INo=1430, next record INO = 1430+1, next 1430+2 until last entry. How to implement same in UPDATE query alongwith "WHERE TYPE=True". </p>
