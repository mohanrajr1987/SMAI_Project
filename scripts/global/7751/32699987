<p>In an attempt to create a listing of Orders (each with multiple items) that satisfy some criteria, I have attempted to create a typical <code>LEFT JOIN</code> statement.</p>  <p>The attempt looks like this</p>  <pre><code>SELECT    Q1.Order_Number,    OD.Item_Num FROM   (   SELECT     OS.Order_Number   FROM      [4-Open_Order_Summary] AS OS    WHERE     Date() &gt;= OS.Ship_Date AND     OS.Back_Ordered &gt; 0   )   AS Q1   LEFT JOIN [1-Open_Order_Data] AS OD    ON Q1.Order_Number = OD.Order_Number </code></pre>  <p>Running this query gives me an unexplained "Invalid operation" error. Researching this error with regards to Access SQL has led me to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12273602/left-joins-in-ms-access">this</a> question on StackOverflow pertaining to multiple <code>JOIN</code> statements of different types, and <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/876168/microsoft-access-left-join-query-giving-invalid-operation-error">this</a> question on the SuperUser branch pertaining to <code>FULL OUTER JOIN</code> statements. However I was unable to find questions related to a single <code>LEFT JOIN</code> statement.</p>  <p>In my attempts to resolve this I have done the following;</p>  <p>Changing<br>  <code>ON Q1.Order_Number = OD.Order_Number</code> to<br>  <code>ON Q1.Order_Number LIKE OD.Order_Number</code><br> crashes Access</p>  <p>Running  </p>  <pre><code>SELECT    Q1.Order_Number,  FROM   (   SELECT     OS.Order_Number   FROM      [4-Open_Order_Summary] AS OS    WHERE     Date() &gt;= OS.Ship_Date AND     OS.Back_Ordered &gt; 0   )   AS Q1   </code></pre>  <p>returns the intended order numbers.</p>
