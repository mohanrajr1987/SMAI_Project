<p>I'm trying to create a dynamic combo box in Access 2007-2010 for a form in a document tracker that removes the option for a specific document if that document is already extant for an employee - i.e. there's no need to track a second W-4 if there's already one for an employee.</p>  <p>I found one way to do this would be using a query with the MINUS clause, which I found I could emulate in Access using the following query:</p>  <p><code>SELECT DISTINCT Document_Name_Index.* FROM Document_Name_Index LEFT JOIN [Paperwork-Tracker-2/0]  ON Document_Name_Index.[Document Name] = [Paperwork-Tracker-2/0].Process_Name WHERE ((([Paperwork-Tracker-2/0].Process_Name) Is Null));</code></p>  <p>But this takes out the option to choose a document if ANY employee has it extant, i.e. If Employee 1 has a W-4, I cannot choose to track a W-4 for Employee 2, regardless of whether they already had one or not.</p>  <p>Is there a way to make this query distinct for each EmployeeID?</p>
