<p>I'm currently working on compiling some code so that I can do the following with two different reports:</p>  <ul> <li>End user inputs first and last Jobs for the report parameter range and clicks button</li> <li>Start Job is stored locally, difference between first and last is calculated and a Do...Loop statement (with counter) is started until counter equals difference. </li> </ul>  <p>During the loop, the job parameter is increased by increments of one (same as the counter) and the report will be printed.</p>  <p>In case I've confused you already, here's some sample code to provide a visual explanation of what I'm currently doing:</p>  <pre><code>Dim NetJobVar As String Dim counter As Long NetJobVar = Me.ToJob - Me.FromJob counter = 0  DoCmd.SetWarnings False 'Query to add first job parameter to local table Me.JobStatus.Visible = True  Do     Me.JobStatus.Caption = "Printing " &amp; Me.FromJob + counter &amp; "..."     'Insert report code here     'Query to add 1 onto Job stored in local table     counter = counter + 1 Loop Until counter = NetJobVar + 1  Me.JobStatus.Visible = False </code></pre>  <p>I've  gotten everything planned out except for  this... I would like to make two different printer configuration windows appear (like when you force the report to print in VBA/Modules) PRIOR to when the report is actually printed in the Do...Loop statement. Otherwise, that could result in countless prompts and very unhappy end users...</p>  <p>Reason why I need two configuration prompts is because we print our Jobs to two different trays (for two different colours of paper). </p>  <p>I've stumbled across a few things... <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2660704/ms-access-print-report-using-vba">here</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19802553/runtime-error-2448-you-cant-assign-a-value-to-this-object">here</a> which have helped, but not to the full extent of what I'm trying to accomplish.</p>  <p>Let me know what you guys think!</p>
