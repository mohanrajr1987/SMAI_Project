<p>I've searched around for a solution to this but am probably not asking the question correctly. I'm fairly new to Access but I need someone's help.</p>  <p>On my "CSEIrrelevants" form I have a couple of Dlookups to autupopulate after updating a previous field entry. They are CustomerName and AgreementName. Essentially, when someone enters a value into the CustomerID and AgreementID fields the subsequent two fields return values from CustomerDatabase Table from CustomerName and AgreementName columns.</p>  <p>The CustomerID Dlookup is working fine asthe references are unique but my problem arises when dealing with the Agreement IDs as these are not unique. Agreement number 1 (the most common agreement number) is returned every time a "1" is entered in the AgreementID field. </p>  <p>What I want is for my Dlookup to return the first instance in the AgreementName column on the CustomerDatabase Table when the CustomerID is A12345, for example.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance for any help on this one guys, much appreciated.
