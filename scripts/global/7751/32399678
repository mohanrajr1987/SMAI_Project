<p>I am writing an Access report showing a list of products on the left hand side and then month by month a shipped total. So something like this:</p>  <pre><code>Product     Jan     Feb    Mar  xxx          10      11     12 </code></pre>  <p>My problem is that the product is pulled from a query however the values for each month are listed individually in the results.  Like this</p>  <pre><code>Product     Quantity   Delivery Month  xxx               10              Jan  xxx               11              Feb </code></pre>  <p>The problem I am having is that the report lists each instance of xxx instead of only listing it once.</p>
