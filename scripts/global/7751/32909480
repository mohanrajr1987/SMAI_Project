<p>I've been using a module to take the name of a form and a control as variables to change a property of a control on a form. For example:</p>  <pre class="lang-vb prettyprint-override"><code>Sub mySub(formName As String, controlName As String)      Forms(formName).Controls(controlName).ForeColor = Colour.RedDark  End Sub </code></pre>  <p>I'd like to do this for a property on a control on a subform as well, but can't quite figure out the syntax to also refer to the subform as a variable too.</p>  <p>I thought it might be something like:</p>  <p><code>Forms(mainFormName).Form(subFormName).Controls(controlName).ForeColor = Colour.RedDark</code></p>  <p>...but this isn't working (<strong>Object doesn't support this property or method</strong>).</p>
