<p>I have an Access 2007 database which I am trying to import an Excel spreadsheet into using Excel VBA.  The VBA script was informing me that  the "record was too large".  I investigated by reducing the field number until it transferred successfully.  The fields number was reduced from 143 to 102 but my research shows the max number of fields for Access tables is 255 so why is mine stopping at 103?</p>  <p>Note:  I did not design the database or gather the data but tasked with importing the data.  Personally I would further normalize the data</p>
