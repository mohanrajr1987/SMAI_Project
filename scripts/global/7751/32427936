<p>I have issues with access 2007 report. Report is build directly from form, where I chose about 20 different things, mostly from combo-boxes and then a report is built. I'd like the last part of the report to start on a separate page, but whenever I insert page break, I get an empty page in that spot. Doesn't matter if it falls into the top or middle of the previous page. Any ideas what to do? Maybe it has something to do with the way I built this report, as there are no groups.</p>
