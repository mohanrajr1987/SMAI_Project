<p>I'm working with a database in Access 2007, one front end and a few backends.</p>  <p>I like to convert all my linked tables to local for offline work so that i don't accidentally spoil the data. </p>  <p>I delete all the relations and tables and then run a saved import.</p>  <p>I'd like to recreate linked tables after I'm done with modifications. Problem is, Access won't save the import of linked tables. Is there a way to simply link all the tables from backend to frontend with VBA</p>
