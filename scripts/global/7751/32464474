<p>Thank you all in advance for any help. I'm Still very new to access and have no idea where to start to find a solution.  What I am trying to do is to auto populate a field in my table called "Period". I would like to have it use the "Activity_Date" to look into a different table that has date ranges that reference to the correct period. Based on which "Period" the "Activity_Date" falls under will return the correct "Period". I've tried using calculated data type and queries and I feel no closer to an answer than when I started.</p>  <p>Thanks again for your time.</p>
