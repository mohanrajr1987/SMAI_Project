<p>I am new to WPF and I want to make a program that is like a game. The common technique I see is to update your game in a dispatch timer (say every 10ms). But this is not ideal for me. </p>  <p>In XNA's update method, there is a 'elapsed' time parameter. Knowing how much time the last frame actually used is very helpful for me to decide what I do in the next frame. Is there any similar technique in WPF?</p>  <p>For some reason I have to use WPF and cannot use XNA.</p>
