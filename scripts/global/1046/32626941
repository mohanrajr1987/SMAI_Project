<p>I'm wondering what options do I have to merge a 2D game into WinRT app that's already developed. I've developed couple of games in Unity3D but not sure if they can be played as a part of WinRT app (launch on button click).</p>  <p>I've heard Microsoft provide XNA framework for game development. Would that be of any help in my case? The requirement is to launch game on button click and get back to app on back button click. </p>  <p>Please let me know if there's better approach/tool available. </p>
