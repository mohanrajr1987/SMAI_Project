<p>I have a very simple XNA program that responds if user presses the left mouse button.</p>  <p>Now I connect my Dell Touch monitor (p2314t) and I thought a 'touch' on the monitor will be equavent to a 'mouse left button' press. But when I tap the screen using my figure, it doesn't respond at all. It only responds when I 'press and slide' on the screen. But what I really want to do is to detect the 'tap' of the touch. </p>  <p>Can anyone help me on this?</p>
