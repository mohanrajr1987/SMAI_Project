<p>When I add Physics to my game, XmlSeralizer can not deserialize the GameplayScreen.xml file and that really bugs me out. But as soon as I remove the physics from everywhere everything is OK again. I have an Entity class to which I add a Body and a base GameScreen class to which I add World class (basically Physics World) and I suppose XmlSerializer doesn't like physics for some strange reason.</p>  <p>I myself tried searching for some attributes that, may be, do not allow for xml serialization, but found nothing, I'm desperate.</p>  <p>Thanks for help in advance!</p>
