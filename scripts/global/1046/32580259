<p>I'm trying to embed an animated avatar that was created using <a href="http://de.esotericsoftware.com/" rel="nofollow">Spine</a> in Xamarin.Forms.</p>  <p>The idea is as follows: I want to create a Xamarin.Forms UI (XAML) in a PCL, instantiate a Game class of the Monogame Framework (Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Game) and have that game instance render on the Xamarin.Forms View.</p>  <p>I have managed to get a Spine animation to run on Xamarin.Android so far.</p>  <p>In the Android project, I can request an "Android View" service type from the Monogame game class, <a href="https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/game_development/monogame/introduction/part1/" rel="nofollow">like that</a>:</p>  <pre><code>protected override void OnCreate (Bundle bundle) {     base.OnCreate (bundle);      var g = new Game1(); //inherits from Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Game     SetContentView((View)g.Services.GetService(typeof(View)));     g.Run(); } </code></pre>  <p>Is there a generic view type I can request from the Game class as to take that view and have it render on a Xamarin.Forms page? (That way I could leave all animation-related code in the PCL and have it render in a cross-platform style.)</p>  <p>Or is there any other way I can integrate the animation in Xamarin.Forms? The animation should exist alongside other Xamarin.Forms controls like buttons or a menu.</p>
