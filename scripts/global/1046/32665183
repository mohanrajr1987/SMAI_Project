<p>I want the game to adapt to the screen resolution, but I want the viewport to always stay the same, so the game basically just resizes itself when running on different PCs. How do I do it? So, for example, screen resolution is 1920x1080 and the viewport is 640x480. How do I stretch those 640x480 onto 1920x1080? Is that even possible? If this did not make any sense, I'll try to explain another way. Thanks in advance!</p>
