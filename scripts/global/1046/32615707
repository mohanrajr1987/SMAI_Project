<p>I have a problem with writing a class in XNA (and monogame). I made a class which solves animation problem, but whenever I compile it I get error like: <code>No graphics device manager found</code>. Tried to do the same thing in <code>struct</code>, but I get an error like: <code>An unhandled exception of type 'System.NullReferenceException' occurred in app.exe</code>.</p>  <p>What am I doing wrong?</p>
