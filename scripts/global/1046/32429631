<p>I have a Texture2D in C# and XNA. I need to rotate it once around one point and then again around another. If I use the following code as an example, it draws the texture twice.</p>  <pre><code>Texture2D texture; float rotation = (float)Math.PI; Vector2 originOne = new Vector2(); Vector2 originTwo = new Vector2(texture.Width / 2, texture.Height / 2);  spriteBatch.Draw(texture, new Rectangle(300, 200, 100, 100), null, Color.White, rotation, originOne, SpriteEffects.None, 0.0f); spriteBatch.Draw(texture, new Rectangle(300, 200, 100, 100), null, Color.White, rotation, originTwo, SpriteEffects.None, 0.0f); </code></pre>  <p>Is there any way for me to draw the texture once after rotating it around two different points? Is there any way for me to merge the two rotations into one calculation?</p>
