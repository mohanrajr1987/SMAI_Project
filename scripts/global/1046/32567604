<p>I have written a very simple XNA game in C# that uses the following method to rotationally alter projectiles as they fly towards a target. The objective of this is to make the projectiles somewhat 'homing':</p>  <pre><code>float rotation; Vector2 velocity; int speed;  public void SetRotation(float value) // Make the projectiles homing {     rotation = value;      velocity = Vector2.Transform(new Vector2(0, -speed),             Matrix.CreateRotationZ(rotation)); } </code></pre>  <p>I am trying (for my own learning purposes - I am very new to JavaScript) to port my game to JavaScript and allow it to be played inside a canvas. Could anyone suggest how I could re-write the above method as a JS function?</p>  <p>As someone who is a complete beginner to JavaScript would this most easily be done using an existing framework of some kind?</p>
