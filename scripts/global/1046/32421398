<p>I have been searching how I can make a chatbox in XNA, but I can't find a way how. I want a chatbox in my game that displays like 10 messages a time. ( The messages can be store in like a List or something ) but I don't know how to do that. I know how to store it, but I don't really know how to put that inside a box ( probably in front of an image, but the width of the string can be bigger ). So what and how is the best way to do it? Thanks for reading the entire question.</p>
