<p>So this may be a bit vague, but I'm having some issues. Basically, I am drawing my little ninja sprite (16x16px) and on 2 frames of his animation, he loses pixels on his headband. I have looked everywhere in an attempt to find an answer, but to no avail.</p>  <p>Original Sprite Sheet (Bugged frames are 4th row, 3rd and 4th frames): </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/1gT6Q.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/1gT6Q.png" alt="enter image description here"></a> </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/VJUD7.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/VJUD7.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>After a little more investigation, it seems that the bugged pixels are due to the width of the sprite sheet. It almost seems random what pixels get messed up depending on the width. However, with a constant width, the messed up pixels are constant regardless of creating a new build or using an old one.</p>  <p>As you can see, the back of his headband is missing pixels. While it may not be game changing, it is very annoying and if anyone knows of a fix, that'd be great! Thanks guys!</p>
