<p>I got a problem publishing a game in XNA 4.0, Whenever I send the published files to my other computer which does not got XNA installed and I execute the Setup.exe it keeps giving me this error : </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Unable to install or run the application. The application requires   that assembly Microsoft.Xna.Framework.GamerServices Version 4.0.0.0 be   installed in the Global Assembly Cache (GAC) first. Please contact   your system administrator.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Now I went looking on google for solutions and read that people told me to remove the gamerservices reference from my whole project, so I did that and rebuild my solution and published again, but unfortunately still the same error.</p>  <p>Ps: This is a clean project with 1 class </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Game.cs</p> </blockquote>  <p>Anybody that experienced this kind of error or can elaborate on this issue? Please feel free to post any help.</p>
