<p>I am new to 3D stuff with only a little experience with XNA. I have zero experience with 3D Graphic Construction, so please go easy.</p>  <p>I have a need to move to a Click and draw Mesh Builder in XNA. Its possibly the easiest way for me to do what I need without going to big expense.</p>  <p>Can anyone give me some ideas on, first if this has already been done, and second, if not what would be an approach for this?</p>  <p>I have looked at some code already:</p>  <pre><code>VertexBuffer VertexPositionColor </code></pre>  <p>A good Blog: <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/shawnhar/archive/2007/09/19/note-to-self-model-hammer.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/shawnhar/archive/2007/09/19/note-to-self-model-hammer.aspx</a></p>  <p>and some code: <a href="http://www.gamedev.net/topic/632220-dynamically-create-modelmesh-meshcontent-modelmesh/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gamedev.net/topic/632220-dynamically-create-modelmesh-meshcontent-modelmesh/</a></p>  <p>Is this something that could be implemented without too much trouble?</p>
