<p>When I tried adding text to my MonoGame program, I encountered a problem. It stopped rendering 3D objects properly, cutting front faces on some, not displaying others altogether.</p>  <p>I've tried ending the batch after drawing the models too, to the same effect</p>  <pre><code>public override void Draw(GameTime gameTime)     {         spriteBatch.Begin();         string output = "Score";          spriteBatch.DrawString(spriteFont, output, Vector2.Zero, Color.LightGreen,             0, Vector2.Zero, 1.0f, SpriteEffects.None, 0.5f);          spriteBatch.End();         foreach (BasicModel model in models)         {             model.Draw(((Game1)Game).GraphicsDevice, ((Game1)Game).mainCamera);         }         base.Draw(gameTime);     } </code></pre>  <p>Why is my text implementation screwing up my 3D models?</p>
