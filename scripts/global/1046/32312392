<p>Every modern version of JSIL I ever try to get working with XNA ends up with this error. </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/p8STH.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/p8STH.png" alt="Error code from JSILc.exe with an XNA 4.0 solution"></a></p>  <p>Everywhere I've ever looked in the past for information about why it doesn't run ends up with an answer about XNA 4.0 not being installed properly or something.</p>  <p>This error was reproduced on 3 different computers.  </p>  <p>I CAN get A version of JSIL working, I can download one of the releases from the git repository (JSIL-0.7.6) and it'll work with XNA providing you don't give it anything the build is unable to support. </p>  <p>But those releases are a couple of years old now.  It would've been nice to get a modern build working.  </p>  <p>I try to offer up some speculation but I'm sort of out of my depth here.  </p>  <p>JSIL-0.7.6 - won't build in AnyCPU, requires the solution platform be set to x86.</p>  <p>Latest JSIL git release - A lot of the projects are now set to AnyCPU and setting them to x86 will create a various mixture of errors or warnings.  </p>  <p>So I think somewhere along the line I might be having problems with a build at the point certain projects in JSIL went from x86 to 64 bit support.</p>  <p>I have visual studio express 2010 and visual studio community installed.  </p>  <p>I've tried things like using XNA refresh.  Using emscription, FNA, etc...</p>  <p>In an ideal world I'd rather get JSIL working with monogame but I get so many errors on any version of JSIL it doesn't seem to be worth bothering.  Porting monogame projects to xna isn't too much trouble.  </p>
