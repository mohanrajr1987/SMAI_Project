<p>I'm currently working on further developing an Open Source client for a game called Endless Online, right now I'm a little stuck with the UI; For example, I've fixed the resizing so the interface does scale with window size, however this is what happens: </p>  <p><strong>[Normal Window Size]</strong> (The minimum and the size the UI is being defined to) <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/j49K7.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/j49K7.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p><strong>[~1920x1080 window size]</strong> <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/iqrWd.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/iqrWd.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>On the normal screen size, the UI works fine. But on anything higher, I can only interact with them from their original position.</p>  <p>I can provide code if needed</p>
