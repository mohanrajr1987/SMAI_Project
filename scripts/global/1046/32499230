<p>The problem is that I have a Screen Manager in my "game" and when switching between screens, I use Xml to instantiate a screen and set some parameters to it, and the thing is that I have no idea how to assign values to properties that can not be just written to a xml file. Doesnt make sense? Better if you see code.</p>  <p>Example xml-code:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;GameScreen&gt;    &lt;Timer&gt;       3 //no problem here    &lt;/Timer&gt;    //but how do I do stuff like this?    //Dimensions is a vector2 from XNA    &lt;FadeImage&gt;       &lt;Scale&gt;           ScreenManager.Dimensions       &lt;Scale&gt;        &lt;/FadeImage&gt;  &lt;GameScreen&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I hope this makes sense and thanks in advance!</p>
