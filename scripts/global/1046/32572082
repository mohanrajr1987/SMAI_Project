<p>I would like to flip character when it walks left\right, I created a character from different body parts so flipping each of them caused this: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/SRW9G.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/SRW9G.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>the reason of course was because it flipped the body parts in their own position, but not all the player together. </p>  <p>after that I had an idea and it was to draw the player to render target and flip the rendertarget when drawing, it worked (kind of), but when I walked when flipped it walked backwards and it also flipped the player position on the screen. here is the code:</p>  <pre><code>  if(mLeavusSprite.isflipped==0)         spriteBatch.Draw(character, rec,rec, Color.White,0,Vector2.Zero,SpriteEffects.None,0);         else             spriteBatch.Draw(character, rec, rec, Color.White, 0, Vector2.Zero, SpriteEffects.FlipHorizontally, 0); </code></pre>  <p>character=render target that the player was drawn to.</p>  <p>is there anything I can do? flipping manually going to be a serious pain, I will need to move manually over 10 animations with 4+ frames each twice! </p>  <p>edit: here is the code for drawing:</p>  <pre><code>           if (Frame == 0)             {                 HeadPosition.X = Position.X;                 HeadPosition.Y = Position.Y;                 BodyPosition.X = HeadPosition.X + 8;                 BodyPosition.Y = HeadPosition.Y + 32;                 TopHandPosition.X = HeadPosition.X + 2;                 TopHandPosition.Y = HeadPosition.Y + 36;                 BackHandPosition.X = HeadPosition.X + 20;                 BackHandPosition.Y = HeadPosition.Y + 36;                 HeadSource = new Rectangle(0, 0, this.Head.Width, this.Head.Height);                 BodySource = new Rectangle(0, 0, 24, 54);                 TopHandSource = new Rectangle(0, 0, 10, 27);                 BackHandSource = new Rectangle(0, 0, 15, 27);                 theSpriteBatch.Draw(BackHand, BackHandPosition, BackHandSource,    Color.White, 0.0f, Vector2.Zero, Scale, FlipIs, 0);                 theSpriteBatch.Draw(Body, BodyPosition, BodySource,              Color.White, 0.0f, Vector2.Zero, Scale, FlipIs, 0);                 theSpriteBatch.Draw(Head, HeadPosition, HeadSource,                 Color.White, 0.0f, Vector2.Zero, Scale, FlipIs, 0);                 theSpriteBatch.Draw(TopHand, TopHandPosition, TopHandSource,          Color.White, 0.0f, Vector2.Zero, Scale, FlipIs, 0);               } </code></pre>  <p>Edit 2:</p>  <pre><code>  if (Frame == 0)             {                 HeadPosition.X = Position.X;                 HeadPosition.Y = Position.Y;                 BodyPosition.X = HeadPosition.X + 8 ;                 BodyPosition.Y = HeadPosition.Y + 32;                 TopHandPosition.X = HeadPosition.X + 2 ;                 TopHandPosition.Y = HeadPosition.Y + 36;                 BackHandPosition.X = HeadPosition.X + 20 ;                 BackHandPosition.Y = HeadPosition.Y + 36;                 HeadSource = new Rectangle(0, 0, this.Head.Width, this.Head.Height);                 BodySource = new Rectangle(0, 0, 24, 54);                 TopHandSource = new Rectangle(0, 0, 10, 27);                 BackHandSource = new Rectangle(0, 0, 15, 27);                 int bigx=0;                 int smallx=0;                 float[] numbers = new[] { HeadPosition.X, BodyPosition.X , TopHandPosition.X, BackHandPosition.X};                 float min = numbers.Min();                 numbers = new[] { HeadPosition.X+HeadSource.Width, BodyPosition.X + BodySource.Width, TopHandPosition.X + TopHandSource.Width, BackHandPosition.X + BackHandSource.Width };                 float max = numbers.Max();                 float center = (max - min) / 2;                 if (flip==1)                 {                     HeadPosition.X = Position.X;                      BodyPosition.X = HeadPosition.X +center+ 8*flipOffset;                      TopHandPosition.X = HeadPosition.X +center+ 2*flipOffset;                      BackHandPosition.X = HeadPosition.X +center+ 20*flipOffset;                  }                 Debug.WriteLine("fff: " + center);                 theSpriteBatch.Draw(BackHand, BackHandPosition, BackHandSource, Color.White, 0.0f, Vector2.Zero, Scale, FlipIs, 0);                 theSpriteBatch.Draw(Body, BodyPosition, BodySource, Color.White, 0.0f, Vector2.Zero, Scale, FlipIs, 0);                 theSpriteBatch.Draw(Head, HeadPosition, HeadSource, Color.White, 0.0f, Vector2.Zero, Scale, FlipIs, 0);                 theSpriteBatch.Draw(TopHand, TopHandPosition, TopHandSource, Color.White, 0.0f, Vector2.Zero, Scale, FlipIs, 0);             } </code></pre>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/mRJmk.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/mRJmk.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
