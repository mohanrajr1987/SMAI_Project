<p>I made a simple networking xna game using c# and lidgren. But velocity of objects are different on friend's computer - resolution of window is the same, fps are the same (both 60), application is the same, but he's character is just slower for some reason. For some time his velocity is equal to mine, but then it slows down again. Other friends do have equal velocities as I do. What could be a problem? The program adjusts movement according to fps, so there is probably no problem in fps.</p>
