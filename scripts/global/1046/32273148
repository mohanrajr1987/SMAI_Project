<p><strong>What am I trying to achieve?</strong></p>  <p>I have a Sprite which is supposed to move with the mouse position (kinda like a cursor). In my case though I also have some other Textures (Obstacle-class). So if the mouse collides with such an obstacle I want the texture to stop moving in that direction.</p>  <p><strong>What is the problem?</strong></p>  <p>While the texture does follow the mouse and also does stop when the mouse "collides" with an obstacle, at some point the cursor is not within the Bounding Rectangle anymore, but on the other side of a wall for example. The consequence, the texture's position is updated to the mouse position and it suddenly appears behind the wall which is not a desired behavior.</p>  <p><strong>My collision method.</strong></p>  <pre><code>    private void CheckCollision(List&lt;Obstacle&gt; _obstacleList, MouseState mState)     {         int xOffset = oldMouseState.X - mState.X;         int yOffset = oldMouseState.Y - mState.Y;          Vector2 offsetPosition = new Vector2(oldMouseState.X + xOffset,oldMouseState.Y + yOffset);          bool collides = false;          foreach (Obstacle obstacle in _obstacleList)         {             if (obstacle.BoundRectangle.Contains(offsetPosition))             {                 collides = true;             }         }          if (!collides)         {             position = offsetPosition;         }     } </code></pre>  <p><strong>Question</strong></p>  <p>What be a way to prevent the sprite to move through walls in my case? </p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
