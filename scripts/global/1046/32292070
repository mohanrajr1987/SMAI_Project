<p>Ever since I started making games in Flash, I have always had a preference to use vector graphics over bitmaps or textures. In Monogame and/or XNA, it is fairly standard to import bitmaps or PNGs and use those for textures, but I would much rather have the textures drawn at runtime at the expense of detail and performance. One framework I found was <a href="http://community.monogame.net/t/altsketch-vector-graphics-library-c-freetype-port-gui-vector-graphics/775" rel="nofollow">AltSketch</a>, although it's not free and it looks overly complicated. Is there any way to do this in Monogame/XNA? Or will I have to switch to another framework like <a href="http://www.cocos2d-x.org/" rel="nofollow">Cocos2d-x</a> or another non .NET framework?</p>  <p>I do not want to use Unity3D - that is out of the question.</p>  <p>Thanks for your help!</p>
