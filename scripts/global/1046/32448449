<p>I am developing a game in MonoGame and decided to create my own button class. In order to determine if these buttons were clicked, I determined if they were in the bounds of the button, and if the left mouse button was down. This has lead to two problems.</p>  <ol> <li>The mouse click doesn't need to start inside the button, and it registers immediately rather than after the mouse button is released (Inside the bounds of the button.)</li> <li>When multiple buttons on different screens are in the same area, it results in clicking them both as the mouse button did not release fast enough.</li> </ol>  <p>How can I make the clicking behave more like the WinForm buttons?</p>
