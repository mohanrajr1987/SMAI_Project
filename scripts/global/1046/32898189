<p>I just started learning game programming at school and we are using c#(and xna. So now we need to make a tetris game. What I want to do is using random number to create the colors so Im wondering wether this is correct or not:</p>  <pre><code>    public Block RandomColor()     {         int r = Random.Next(6);         if (r == 0)         {             return Color.Red;         }         else if (r == 1)         {             return Color.Orange;         }         else if (r == 2)         {             return Color.Yellow;         }         else if (r == 3)         {             return Color.Green;         }         else if (r==4)         {             return Color.Blue;         }         else if (r==5)         {             return Color.Indigo;         }         else if (r==6)         {             return Color.Purple;         } </code></pre>  <p>I am pretty uncertain about this because</p>  <p>1) visual studio doesnt give errors on this one</p>  <p>2) But everytime I want to write Color 2 things pop up: RandomColor and ConsoleColor. Do I need randomColor then instead of Color? </p>  <p>I tested wether I could screw with the code after Color. and the answer was yes. So does it mean the colors wont change when I run the code?</p>  <p>First time on stackoverflow so not sure Im doing this right:)</p>
