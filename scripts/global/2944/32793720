<p>I am new to tKinter. I tried this code and it did not work. When I click any of the buttons(Yes/No), the dialog does not close and the print statement does not  print. I know in Swing I need events to print this statement. Is it the same in tKinter?</p>  <pre><code>from tkinter import * import tkinter.messagebox  root = Tk()  answer=tkinter.messagebox.askquestion('Question','what is your name?') if answer=='Yes': print('I am King')  root.mainloop() </code></pre>  <p>How do I go about correcting it?</p>
