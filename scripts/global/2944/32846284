<p>Whenever I launch the Visual Studio 2015 Publish Web Dialogue (or Visual Studio 2013, both have the same issue) for a <em>specific</em> project, it takes ~20-30 seconds for it to open. Just as well, when I switch between publish profiles it takes the same amount of time <em>when I switch to a specific one</em>. When I switch to Profile A in the list (from Profile B) it takes the same amount of time as it does when it launches the dialogue itself. When I switch from Profile A to the Profile B it doesn't take any time at all.</p>  <p>Does anyone have any ideas on this? I lose 20-30 minutes a day of development on this issue alone.</p>  <p>I have inspected the XML (<code>.pubxml</code>) on both profiles, and they are identical except for the name of the site on the server, and the <code>Web.config</code> SQL string transformation result. (They both publish to the <em>same</em> server endpoint, both are precompiled with all pages/controls set to one assembly, the only difference is the name of the profile and what the name of the site is.)</p>  <p>I also inspected the profile <code>.user</code> file, and both are identical <em>once again</em>. I am at a loss as to what could be the issue here.</p>  <p>Do note that publishing does not take a lot of time at all. It takes just as long for Profile A to publish as Profile B does.</p>  <p>Also, this issue was present even on my old Visual Studio 2015 installation before I reinstalled Windows completely. (And I did reinstall Windows <em>entirely</em> when I upgraded to Windows 10.)</p>  <p>I am open to any and all ideas, I might reinstall Visual Studio 2015 <strong>again</strong> to see if the issue goes away.</p>  <p>Further notes: while it is loading the dialogue, it locks Visual Studio up <em>entirely</em>.</p>  <p>Update: reinstalling Visual Studio entirely did not rectify the issue.</p>  <p>Another update: Occasionally Visual Studio crashes completely when opening the dialogue.</p>
