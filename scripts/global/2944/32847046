<p>What is the best approach to develop a totally new look &amp; feel dialog for a setup developed in InstallShield?</p>  <p>I have considered creating a new skin, but, it is limited to a specified dialog size which is not suitable for my needs. I have also considered creating a new dialog using standard InstallShield tools, but, the functionality is lacking to my needs. Another option is to create a dialog using resource file in Visual Studio. No idea how to change the background color of the dialog. Any pointers to a manual?</p>  <p>Any other ideas how to create a highly customized dialog for my setup?</p>  <p>Thanks, Liora</p>
