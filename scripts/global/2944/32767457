<p>I've recently inherited an old MFC application and am puzzled by differences in how its dialogs are styled in different places.</p>  <p>When I open the .RC file and look at the dialogs in Visual Studio they look significantly different than they do at runtime.  Most notably, dialog frame and button borders both have a rounded style and the buttons have a gradient applied.  When I run the application they have a square/flat style.  I'd prefer the style shown in the designer; but don't know where/why it's not being used at runtime.</p>  <p>The screenshot on the left is from the VS designer.  The one on the right is what I'm seeing when I run the application itself.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/f4g5D.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/f4g5D.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
