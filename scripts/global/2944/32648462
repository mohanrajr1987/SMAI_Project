<p>I know that from android 3.1 and above you can't turn on location services manually. But in Google maps it simply shows an dialog which prompts me to switch it on. This directly switches it on (In android 5.1 - Lollipop). So how does google do it? Is it some Google location services API I can use or should I direct the user to the location services settings screen?  Thanks.</p>
