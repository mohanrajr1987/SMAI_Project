<p>I have a Navigation drawer activity and many fragments that I reach via the nav drawer.</p>  <p>In some of these fragments, I show a dialog which says "Loading.." while background tasks are happening. </p>  <p>Now I've made my dialogs not-cancellable by <code>dialog.setCancelable(false)</code> so that the user doesn't accidentally dismiss it by clicking anywhere on the screen. This makes it un-cancelable even when the phone back button is pressed.</p>  <p>This is the code for my dialog - </p>  <pre><code>Dialog dialog = new Dialog(context);     dialog.requestWindowFeature(Window.FEATURE_NO_TITLE);     dialog.setContentView(R.layout.custom_progress_dialog);     ((TextView)dialog.findViewById(R.id.custom_dialog_message)).setText("Loading ...");      dialog.setCancelable(false);          dialog.show(); </code></pre>  <p>I need to write code to dismiss the loading dialog and go to the previous fragment when the phone back button is pressed while on any fragment.</p>  <p>Can somebody help me out? Mostly I need implementing backPress specific to a fragment. Thanks!</p>
