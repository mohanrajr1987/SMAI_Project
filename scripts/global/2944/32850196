<p>In my small project, I need to implement authentication. When I run application from mobile, it is shown page, otherwise, in desktop it's shown ContentDialog.</p>  <p>If I try to access a page that is reserved for certified people, ContentDialog is called and make successful authentication are redirected to this page. Otherwise does nothing.</p>  <p>It is possible to implement the same logic but for a page with small changes in code? (which is waiting for the login is made successfully and then redirect?)</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
