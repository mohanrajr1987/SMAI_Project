<p>I am working on Kiosk Mode and I looking for a way to close 'Power off, Restart' system dialog while fragment is opened. For now, in my activity I used onWindowFocusChanged. </p>  <pre><code>@Override public void onWindowFocusChanged(boolean hasFocus) {     super.onWindowFocusChanged(hasFocus);     if(!hasFocus) {         Intent closeDialog = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_CLOSE_SYSTEM_DIALOGS);         sendBroadcast(closeDialog);     } } </code></pre>  <p>But when some fragment is visible and 'Power off' dialog appears onWindowFocusChanged will no be called.</p>
