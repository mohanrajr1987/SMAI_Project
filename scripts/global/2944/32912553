<p>I am having trouble with FB UI and its JavaScript SDK feed dialog. I Can't post on wall message with an empty <em>'Say something about this'</em> field. I receive a success response after my send, but the message is not displayed on the wall. If I write something in that field, the dialog will be displayed. How to fix this?</p>  <p>I send the dialog like this:</p>  <pre><code>FB.ui(     {         method: 'feed',         name: 'example',         link: loc,         picture: src,         description:description,         message: 'example',         actions: {"name":"example", "link": loc},     }, </code></pre>
