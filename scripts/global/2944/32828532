<p>When I close all windows (frames/dialogs) the debugger keeps the program running.  That's the problem.<br> I want the program to close when the dialogs are closed.</p>  <p>I want to do both:<br>  1.  Run a program with a dialog as a main window and have the program exit when I close that dialog.<br> 2.  Run a program with a window frame that can pop up 1 or more dialogs and have that program close once all the dialogs are closed. (currently, closing the form does close all the dialogs, but not the app) <br>If there was only a frame, it closes just fine.</p>  <p>How can I close a (null parent) dialog box so that it doesn't keep the program running (message loop running) once all windows are closed.  I do not need the dialog box to cause a program exit, just not prevent a program exit.</p>  <p>In the following sample, if the form were a dialog or if a dialog(ok dialog) were created from within the form and then closed, the program keeps running with all windows closed.</p>  <pre><code>class MyApp : public wxApp {     public:     bool OnInit(); private:     void OnAboutClicked(wxCommandEvent &amp;evt);     MyFrame1 *myF; }; bool MyApp::OnInit() {     if (!wxApp::OnInit())         return false;     myF = new MyFrame1(NULL);     myF-&gt;Show();     return true; } </code></pre>  <p>These do not help.</p>  <pre><code>MyDialog1::~MyDialog1() {     //this-&gt;Destroy();     //delete this; } </code></pre>
