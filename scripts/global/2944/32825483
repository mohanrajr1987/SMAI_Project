<p>I have designed this app for android and users want me to add a confirmation pop up for the button action to continue. Something like if <code>Yes</code> is clicked then the action continues , but if <code>No</code> is clicked the process breaks . I have read through the Web and see that a <code>dialog</code> is used for this. Can someone explain probably with a <strong>sample code</strong> how this works.</p>
