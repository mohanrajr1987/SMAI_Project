<p>I am creating an application that needs some initial setup parameters. I wanted to build a Terminal User Interface in python to give a nicer input option to my users. I am using this library that is found at <a href="http://pythondialog.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">http://pythondialog.sourceforge.net/</a></p>  <p>Everything works great and suites my needs from the functionality standpoint. I would like to chnage the background color of the terminal though. Currently, it is bright blue, and I don't like that color. I have searched their documentation located at <a href="http://pythondialog.sourceforge.net/doc/" rel="nofollow">http://pythondialog.sourceforge.net/doc/</a> to no avail. How would one go about modifying the background color?</p>
