<p>Let me first say that I do not want a copy of a resource file on two projects (I have seen a question about that). </p>  <p>Using Windows 7, MS VS 2013, C++, MFC.</p>  <p>These two projects I will be referencing are part of the same solution.</p>  <p>I have a dialog that has been created with rc/h/cpp files for it that works in one project (Project A). I want to be able to open that dialog from a routine in a separate project (Project B). Project B has a GUI button that when clicked I wish for the dialog from Project A to be brought up. </p>  <p>I have included a reference to Project A in the properties of Project B. </p>  <p>I have included (#include) the rc file path for Project A in the rc file for Project B (which takes care of the resource file, and the definition numbers for the resource file do not overlap).</p>  <p>I have included the path (From Project A) to the class that controls the dialog in Project B (in the file that contains the event handler to bring up the dialog).</p>  <p>There are no errors with the setup I have, it just doesn't do anything. I create the dialog and try a <code>DoModal</code> on it like I would anywhere in Project A (where it works) and nothing happens, I can click the button many times and it never brings anything up.</p>  <p>I cannot provide any of the code on this, but I hope that is enough information to give me some kind of clue. I am lost as of now. Thank you.</p>  <p>Ex of routine:</p>  <pre><code>#include "DialogIWant.h"  ...  void OnPushButtonOnProjectB () {     CDialogIWant dialog;  // CPP/H/RC in the other project A     dialog.DoModal();  // Nothing comes up } </code></pre>
