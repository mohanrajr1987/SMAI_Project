<p>I am trying to display a file in a Linux dialog textbox that was created with this command (the file that is):</p>  <pre><code>diff -u --ignore-all-space $FILE $NEWFILE${FILE#$OLDFILE} &gt;&gt; $tempfile1 </code></pre>  <p>The command for the textbox is</p>  <pre><code>        dialog --backtitle "$BACKTITLE"\         --begin 3 5\         --title "Differences in files found"\         --textbox $tempfile1  $(( `tput lines` - 10 ))  $(( `tput cols` - 10 )) </code></pre>  <p>Only part of the file is displayed. The lines starting with "---", "+++" and "@@" are displayed. The lines starting with "-" or "+" are suppressed. Does anybody know how I can display the whole file? I tried changing the output format of diff but that didn't change the way the dialog box displayed the file.</p>
