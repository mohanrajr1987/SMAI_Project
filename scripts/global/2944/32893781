<p>For school, I am making a program where the user enters three integers and the program finds the product of these three integers and outputs the result to the user. The teacher requires that I use the JOptionPane class. How do I make the program terminate with an error when a non valid integer is entered. And also, how do I output the answer in a java window? Thanks in advance!</p>  <pre><code>import javax.swing.JOptionPane;  public class ASTheProductofThreeGUI {      public static void main(String[] args) {          //initializes variable "answer" of type integer          //prompts the user to enter their first integer for the product of three         int value1 = Integer.parseInt(JOptionPane.showInputDialog("Enter your first"                 + " value as an integer"));           //prompts the user to enter their second integer         int value2 = Integer.parseInt(JOptionPane.showInputDialog("Enter your second"                 + " value as an integer"));           //prompts the user to enter their third integer         int value3 = Integer.parseInt(JOptionPane.showInputDialog("Enter your third"                 + " value as an integer"));           int answer = value1 * value2 * value3;  </code></pre>
