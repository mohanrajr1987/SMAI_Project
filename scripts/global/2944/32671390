<p>I made a custom dialog (extends Dialog) and then make the object in Activity Sample.class</p>  <p>Then if I click one button in the Activity and the custom dialog shows up.</p>  <p>Here, the problem is, since the custom dialog contains the EditText, the soft keyboard is needed and it shows up, but if I click(tab) the screen outside of the dialog, the "cancel" listener is called so that the dialog is disappeared. However, what I want to implement is when I click the screen outside of the dialog, only just keyboard disappearing. Can anyone help me?</p>
