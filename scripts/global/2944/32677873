<p>we have a cordova app, started about 3 years ago.</p>  <p>the app was working without problems on iOS &lt;= 8.</p>  <p>now randomly views created in plugins (even official ones from cordova team) are not displayed anymore. still on iOS8.</p>  <p>for example:</p>  <pre><code>// Show the confirmation dialog navigator.notification.confirm(     "Are you sure you want to logout?",     onConfirm,     "Logout",     ['OK','Cancel'] ); </code></pre>  <p>so very simple, pretty standard code.</p>  <p>the problem is also with other plugins.</p>  <p>Cordova version for ios 3.7.0 and org.apache.cordova.dialogs 0.2.6.</p>  <p>the views or alerts are not shown in the app. but if you double tap the Home HW button, you can see the view in the app screenshot.</p>  <p>sometimes when you get back in the app it is visible, sometimes not.</p>  <p>did anybody experience this, any ideas?</p>  <p>thanks.</p>
