<p>I have written a tool in C++ which uses <a href="/questions/tagged/c%2b%2b11" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;c++11&#39;" rel="tag">c++11</a> features. It uses <code>std::regex</code> to provide regex functionality.</p>  <p>It requires GCC (>=4.9.0) to compile the code.</p>  <p>This is the error message on a Ubuntu system where <code>libstdc++6</code> is not installed.</p>  <pre><code>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.20' not found </code></pre>  <p>I am packaging this software for Ubuntu, but can not figure out which version of <code>libstdc++6</code> should I put as a dependency of my program.</p>  <p>And what will be the dependency of this program for a general case regarding all Unix like OS that I should notify the user beforehand?</p>
