<p>I have come across some code which allocates a 2d array with following approach:</p>  <pre><code>auto a = new int[10][10]; </code></pre>  <p>Is this a valid thing to do in C++? I have search through several C++ reference books, none of them has mentioned such approach.  Normally I would have done the allocation manually as follow:</p>  <pre><code>int  **a = new int *[10]; for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {     a[i] = new int[10]; } </code></pre>  <p>If the first approach is valid, then which one is preferred?</p>
