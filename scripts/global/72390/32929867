<p>I was reading <a href="http://herbsutter.com/2013/06/13/gotw-93-solution-auto-variables-part-2/" rel="nofollow">this</a> article which states</p>  <p>that </p>  <pre><code>widget w = get_gadget(); --&gt;a auto w = get_gadget();   --&gt;b </code></pre>  <p>in statement 'a' a temporary is created then widget w is move constructed from the temporary. I totally understand that statement. What I don't understand is how statement 'b' using the <code>auto</code> variable is better than statement 'a'. It says </p>  <blockquote>   <p>.... we could write the following which guarantees there is no   implicit conversion because auto always deduces the basic type   exactly:</p>      <p>// better, if you don't need an explicit type </p>      <p><code>auto w = get_gadget();</code></p> </blockquote>  <p>Could anyone please explain why statement 'b' is better than 'a' ?</p>
