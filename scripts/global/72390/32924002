<p>I wanted to code a line that shuffles a vector. Auto completion suggested <code>shuffle_order_engine</code>, which made me curious what it is, since the name suggests it does what I want.</p>  <p>Usually i shuffle a vector with <code>std::shuffle(std::begin(v), std::end(v), gen)</code> where <code>gen</code> is the random number generator (usually <code>mt19937_64</code>).</p>  <p><a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/random/shuffle_order_engine/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/random/shuffle_order_engine/</a> sais, that <code>shuffle_order_engine</code> is:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>An engine adaptor class template that adapts a pseudo-random number   generator Engine type so that the numbers are delivered in a different   sequence.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Well, cplusplus.com does not provide an example. Is <code>shuffle_order_engine</code> doing the same as my <code>shuffle</code> adoption?</p>
