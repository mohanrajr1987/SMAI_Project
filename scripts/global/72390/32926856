<p>I am implementing a list class for a project and am really confused on how to set up my makefile. I did all my coding in the Xcode IDE and it compiles perfectly there but I need to make sure I can compile my program on unix. I used c++11 features in my code and was under the impression I was writing the flag correctly in my makefile -std=c++11 but it's not being recognized. I have my List.hpp, List.h, test_list.cpp all in the same directory as my make file as well. Do I need to write something different in my makefile since my implementation of my list class is a hpp file and not a cpp file?</p>  <p>This is the error I am getting word for word: </p>  <pre><code>g++ -std=c++11 -Wall -pedantic -g -o proj2.x test_list.cpp cc1plus: error: unrecognized command line option "-std=c++11" make: *** [proj2.x] Error 1 </code></pre>  <p>Could someone help explain where I am going wrong with my makefile? If there is anything else I should post to assist someone in answering my question do let me know.</p>  <p>Here is what I have:</p>  <pre><code>C=g++ CXX=g++ CXXFLAGS=-std=c++11 -Wall -pedantic  proj2.x: test_list.cpp     $(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) -g -o proj2.x test_list.cpp  clean:     rm *.o *.x </code></pre>
