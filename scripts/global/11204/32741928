<p>I'm working on some Backbone project, where we are working with bunch of Collections/Models/Views, on same 'page', and we are trying to use as much as possible of Backbone.</p>  <p>So now ( PM's ) got idea to use jqGrid, because it is 'fancy', and we need to connect this with Backbone. My 2 days experience with Backbone + jqGrid is not so good.</p>  <p>Could anyone tell / explain me why should I try to implement this solution or should I continue with convincing to use some other gird which is compatible with Backbone?</p>  <p>What I found out ( Doesn't mean this is true ):</p>  <ol> <li>You can't connect backbone Model to jqGrid row  <ul> <li>You can't have Backbone events on grid Row without extra jquery code, which is messy.</li> </ul></li> <li>jqGrid is not so good with Backbone templates   <ul> <li>We are using lot templates ( underscore ), sometimes couple per page, and it's nightmare to show/reload grid based on some dynamic/filtered Collections</li> </ul></li> </ol>  <p>Thanks</p>
