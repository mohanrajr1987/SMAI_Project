<p>ALL, I'm trying to create a custom formatter using jqgrid which should be feasible to set the precision and scale values.</p>  <p>Most of the forum questions are mentioning only about the decimal places but I would like to RESTRICT the digits before and after the decimal places.</p>  <p>i.e, the cell should have 2 digits before decimal places and 2 digits after decimal places. When user types 123456, then after keyOut event the cell should display 12.34    </p>  <p>Any suggestions? </p>
