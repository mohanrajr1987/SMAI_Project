<p>I have a jqgrid in which i have a column of buttons. I want to delete row from this button. My question is i want to make confirm message pop up when i click on the button. I appreciate if i can customize the dialog box. So how i can do this? I have tried bootstrap pop up and query but i think i did something wrong.</p>  <pre><code>So is there any way to make pop up in JQgrid? </code></pre>  <p>This is my column.</p>  <pre><code>{                     name: "action",                     align: "center",                      sortable: false,                     title: false,                     fixed: true,                     search: false,                     formatter: function (cellvalue, options, rowObject) {                          var links = "&lt;a title=''  href='/Admin/Workflow/Delete?id=" + rowObject.templateId + "'&gt;" + "Delete" + "&lt;/a&gt;";                         return links;                     }                 } </code></pre>
