<p>I am trying to add rowData in jqGrid as :</p>  <pre><code>var grid  = $("#jqGrid"); var newRowID =myData[0].alarmID; grid.addRowData(newRowID, myData, "first"); </code></pre>  <p>Now the data that i am able to add is coming one by one.. Meaning, first it adds first row then again 2nd row and then 3rd and so on. So above code is being called in loop..</p>  <p><strong>Now what i am trying to do is, i am trying to call jqGrids gridComplete function just after above code</strong> </p>  <p>In that gridComplete function i am checking if the alarm type is High then add custom buttons. </p>  <p>Is it possible to call gridComplete Function just after addRowData?</p>  <p>If you need my complete code. Please do inform. i will post it here..</p>  <p>Looking forward to your solutions. Thanks in advance.</p>
