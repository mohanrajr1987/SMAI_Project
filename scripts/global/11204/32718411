<p>I would like to provide <code>bindKeys</code> functionality on my jqGrid. This means on <kbd>Enter</kbd>, the data should be saved (working fine), on <kbd>left</kbd> arrow the cursor should move to the left editable cell and so on.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/QDDs9.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/QDDs9.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>This means when the cursor is at left most position in the textbox as shown in the image and the <kbd>left</kbd> arrow key is pressed, the cursor should be moved to the previous editable cell (in this case <em>Item Number</em>). If the cursor is somewhere in the middle of the text then the normal behavior should be happening. </p>  <p>Similarly on the <kbd>right</kbd> arrow key, it should move to the right editable cell, if the cursor is at the right most position. Again if the cursor is somewhere in the middle of the text then the normal behavior should be happening. </p>  <p>On the <kbd>up</kbd> and <kbd>down</kbd> arrow keys, the editable row should be switched to the upper and lower row respectively. </p>  <p>I have tried implementing <code>bindKeys</code> but it does not seem to work. What am I missing here?</p>  <p><strong>Grid code:</strong> <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/OlegKi/HJema/168/" rel="nofollow">jsFiddle</a></p>
