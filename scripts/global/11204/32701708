<p><strong>Part 1)</strong> In my grid, I have some editable columns which I would like to do inline editing to. However when I select any particular cell and if the inline editing is available on that cell (<code>editable: true</code>), it should select the text to be edited.</p>  <p>For example if this is the default grid: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/aUL7Q.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/aUL7Q.png" alt="enter image description here"></a> then upon selecting any cell in Quantity, the result should be something like this: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/qUAW6.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/qUAW6.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>When we click on a cell to edit that row in jqGrid, current implementation does not highlight the selected text like this. Is there any way to achieve this?</p>  <p><strong>Part 2)</strong> Migrated to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32718411/jqgrid-bindkeys-change-arrow-and-tab-keys-behavior">this question</a> as per Oleg's suggestion</p>  <p><strong>GRID CODE:</strong> <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/HJema/162/" rel="nofollow">jsFiddle</a></p>  <p><em>Note:</em> My real application datatype is <code>JSON</code></p>
