<p>I would like to know if its possible to create a jqgrid with a footer template for adding new rows as in .net grid view. </p>  <p>I don't want bulk updates only single row update and single row insert at a time. For updating records I have seen that inline editing is possible with jqgrid, where I only need to know if I can call the ajax method to update the grid on editing every row and clicking the corresponding save button. Please help me with those two queries.</p>  <p>@Oleg: What I intend to have is a row which keeps displaying on every page of the jqgrid. This row must contain input fields (Text boxes) , and must allow insertion of new rows. It should have a save button at the end of row and when I click it the row should be updated and grid must be bound again.</p>  <p>Regarding update - we are not showing whole data in a single instance instead we have given custom pagination using which we fetch data as per requirements, since this is a business Intelligence app lot of data manipulation exists and there is huge data too.</p>  <p>Here's the image you asked for </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/1AxWS.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/1AxWS.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>That row must be visible to enable users enter data even when on other pages say second or third page of the grid. Here, because we are doing custom pagination I can assume that if once it is created I can make sure I can display it. </p>  <p>Notice the save button and reset button. reset is a simple functionality, But for save I want to trigger SP whenever it is clicked, and then reload the grid with uploaded data. </p>  <p>I have seen that version 4.0 (Inline navigation - <a href="http://www.trirand.com/blog/jqgrid/jqgrid.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.trirand.com/blog/jqgrid/jqgrid.html</a>  in row editing section) is what I want (though not exactly), but I also want to remove search functionality and paging functionality out of the pager as I have my own search functionality and paging functionality. It would be much helpful if you point me out to some C# code as I am using it with asp.net. Have no idea of php at all.</p>  <p>Please suggest.</p>
