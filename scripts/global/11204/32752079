<p>I would like to know if there is any event that I can use while grouping to add an additional subtotal row(on top of each total) for each grouping key. By Default afterInsertRow does not fire if grouping is enabled.</p>  <p>Any way to achieve this?</p>  <p>More details updated:</p>  <p>Hi Oleg, currently I am grouping the jqgrid by category column(I am displaying list of products). So for each category I am able to see the total column(summary). This works perfectly fine when I am fetching only active products. But I have a scenario when I am showing Active and inactive products the I want to additionally add another subtotal summary row where I aggregate only the inactive rows. The total summary row for each group should aggregate active and inactive rows and that is working fine as well. I just need a way to display the subtotals summary row only for inactive rows. This subtotal row should sit just above the total row for each group. I hope this makes sense you to.</p>
