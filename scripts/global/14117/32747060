<p>I've implemented a .NET MVC form in Razor which uses client-side validation (<code>jquery.validate.js</code> and <code>jquery.validate.unobtrusive.js</code>).  My form has a number of different fields that are required and whose format is validated.  I'm using data annotations in the model to define this.  Eg:</p>  <pre><code>[Required(ErrorMessage = "SSN is required")] [RegularExpression(@"^\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}|\d{9}$", ErrorMessage = "SSN must be in the format 000-00-0000")] [Display(Name = "SSN")] public string Ssn { get; set; } </code></pre>  <p>It appears that the default behavior is to validate each form field <strong>when it changes</strong>.  Using the SSN example, as soon as I start typing an SSN, I see an error message saying "SSN must be in the format 000-00-0000".  I find this is an invasive/distracting UX since, really, no error has occurred yet; I simply haven't finished entering data.</p>  <p>Is there a way to configure client-side validation to not validate until at least a field has lost focus?  Ideally, not until the form has been submitted.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>  <p><strong>FWIW, here is what my form looks like:</strong></p>  <pre><code>@using (Html.BeginForm("AccountSetup", "Account", FormMethod.Post, new { role = "form", autocomplete = "off" })) {     @Html.ValidationSummary(true, "Please correct the error(s) below.")     &lt;div class="form-group"&gt;         @Html.LabelFor(m =&gt; m.SocialSecurityNumber, new { @class = "label-required" })         @Html.TextBoxFor(m =&gt; m.SocialSecurityNumber, new { @class = "form-control", maxlength = 11, data_mask = "000-00-0000" })         @Html.ValidationMessageFor(m =&gt; m.SocialSecurityNumber)     &lt;/div&gt; } </code></pre>  <p>My web.config has these appsettings:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;add key="ClientValidationEnabled" value="true" /&gt; &lt;add key="UnobtrusiveJavaScriptEnabled" value="true" /&gt; </code></pre>
