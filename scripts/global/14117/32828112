<p>i've made a form with my input fields as:</p>  <pre><code>name="some_name[]" </code></pre>  <p>to get it as a multidimensional array when posting it</p>  <p>using jquery validator to validate the fields but i do have a problem with  the remote function....</p>  <p>my code:</p>  <pre><code> "some_name[]": {     required: true,     digits: true,     rangelength: [4, 4],     remote:           {               type:'POST',               url:plugin_path+'ajax/vogn_check.php',           } </code></pre>  <p>the form it self is dynamic so people can add as many rows as they want. here is the problem:</p>  <p>when filling out the field remote is attached to it works fine on the first row but when i add a second row i have to tap out of the field twice before it acualy validates it.</p>  <p>i've tried with <code>.on('change', 'form', .on('keyup', 'form'</code></p>  <p>but still have to tap out twice! anyone who knows how to go about this?</p>
