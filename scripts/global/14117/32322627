<p>I'm trying to add a depends clause to a custom validation routine in jquery validate. What's the syntax to pass the parameter object? So it's supposed to check the archive Date is after the value in publishDate, but only if the checkbox isn't checked. Note that the method works fine when there's no depends and I just add <code>afterDate: '#publishDate'</code>. I'm just trying to work out how to pass the params object to the function...</p>  <pre><code>archiveDate.rules("add",{         afterDate: {             params: ["#publishDate"],             depends: '#publishNow:unchecked'         },         messages: {           afterDate: 'Archive date should be after publish date'         }     } ) </code></pre>
