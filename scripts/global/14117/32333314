<p>I have to use a template in our CMS that is preloaded with an old version of jQuery Validate plug-in, and my code is written to use the newer version of jQuery Validate. If these two versions are loaded on the same page, it won't validate, and I have no way/permission to unlink the old jQuery Validate plug-in, and I have to use the newer jQuery Validate plugin. </p>  <p>Is there a way to solve this? Does it have something like <code>jQuery.noConflict()</code>?</p>
