<p>Sorry if this is too simple a question, but it is one that I have been trying to solve for a while.</p>  <p>I am trying to use Jquery Validate on a simple form, and I basically have everything working as it should, however I would like to place the message label generated by the validation in different places pending on whether it is an error or a success. Currently, I can either get both of them before or after the field. I would like any errors to populate before the field, and successes to populate after the field. </p>  <p>Currently when it is a success the class <code>valid</code> is added to the label.</p>  <p>Here is my <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/whyEnBe/9yLbmqzv/1/" rel="nofollow">Fiddle</a>.</p>  <p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>  <p>Here is my HTML: </p>  <pre><code>&lt;form id="new_user"&gt;    &lt;input class="row" id="name" name="user_name" placeholder="Name" required="required" type="text"&gt; &lt;/form&gt; </code></pre>  <p>This is my most recent attempt:</p>  <p>JS: </p>  <pre><code>$("#new_user").validate({     success: function(label) {         label.addClass("valid").text(" âœ“ ")     },     errorClass: "invalid",     errorPlacement: function(error, element) {         if (error.hasClass("valid") == "valid" ) {             alert("valid");             error.insertAfter(element);         } else {             error.insertBefore(element);         }     }  }); </code></pre>
