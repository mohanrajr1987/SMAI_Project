<p>I've got a field in a partial that takes an email address, I want to validate this as the user types and display a message using <a href="http://jqueryvalidation.org/" rel="nofollow">this plugin</a></p>  <p><strong>Update: <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/ch341eso/2/" rel="nofollow">Fiddle Example</a></strong></p>  <p>My form has no name that this field is contained within, it's actually in a partial of a partial, it's the last field I need to validate and it's giving me grief.</p>  <p>The main issue seems to be how I'm trying to access the field itself, as it's dynamic, using jQuery I access it through <code>$("input[name*='email']")</code> with the <code>rules: {}</code>, however I get errors when I try to use that within the validate plugin function (jquery I'm not great with, needless to say).</p>  <p>How can I access the email field, as it comes out something like <code>contacts[884414e3-9262-4a77-a448-b8f885703e9d].email</code>?</p>  <p><strong>jQuery:</strong></p>  <pre><code>var email = $("input[name*='email']");     $('form').validate({         rules: {             email: "required email",         },         messages: {             email: {                 required: "Enter your Email",                 email: "Please enter a valid email address.",             }         }     }); </code></pre>  <p><strong>Also tried:</strong></p>  <pre><code>$('form').validate({         rules: {             "input[name*='email']": "required email",         },         messages: {             "input[name*='email']": {                 required: "Enter your Email",                 "input[name*='email']": "Please enter a valid email address.",             }         }     }); </code></pre>
