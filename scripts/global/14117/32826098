<p>Currently I have the form with a field that a tooltip set to provide more information about that field. The tooltip is set using the 'jquery-beautytips' plugin for 'click' trigger event a particular div element. However, I am also using jquery validator plugin for checking if the field is required or not.</p>  <p>Now, the issue is that the validator's q-tip error content is loaded on top of the tooltip when the tooltip is open. How can I achieve something like - When I click on the div that has bt trigger on it, it checks if the q-tip is shown for that field, then it update left padding to it (add when the bt is on and remove when bt is off).</p>
