<p>I am writing some error handling for when my HealthKit client requests permission to data in Xamarin iOS.  I make the request like so:</p>  <pre><code>public HKClient() {     var HealthKitStore = new HKHealthStore();     HealthKitStore.RequestAuthorizationToShare (dataTypesToWrite, dataTypesToRead, OnHealthPermissionsCompleted); }  void OnHealthPermissionsCompleted (bool success, NSError error) {     //Parse error.Domain and error.Code herere } </code></pre>  <p>In my OnHealthPermissionsCompleted, I want to parse the NSError in order to debug why our request failed.  The first thing to do is check error.Domain to make sure it is a HealthKit error and then compare error.Code to the constants in the HKErrorCode enum.  The problem is, I cannot find any constant for what should be in error.Domain for HealthKit related errors.  The Apple documentation says there should be a constant called "HKErrorDomain" for me to compare to, however it is not there in Xamarin. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/watchos/documentation/HealthKit/Reference/HealthKit_Constants/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/constant_group/Health_Kit_Error_Domain" rel="nofollow">https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/watchos/documentation/HealthKit/Reference/HealthKit_Constants/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/constant_group/Health_Kit_Error_Domain</a></p>  <p><a href="https://developer.xamarin.com/api/namespace/HealthKit/" rel="nofollow">https://developer.xamarin.com/api/namespace/HealthKit/</a></p>  <p>If I force an error and then check it in the debugger, I do see that error.Domain = "com.apple.healthkit".  I could just compare to that string, </p>  <pre><code>void OnHealthPermissionsCompleted (bool success, NSError error) {     if(!success &amp;&amp; error.Domain == "com.apple.healthkit")     {          //continue parsing...     } } </code></pre>  <p>but putting magic strings in these kinds of things makes me feel icky, especially when I know a constant for this exists in native iOS.  Am I missing something here or is this my only option?</p>
