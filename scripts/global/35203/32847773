<p>I'm developing a Xamarin app that will simply let the user click a link to a remote audio file, and I'd like the audio file to open in the native, default iOS media player. I don't need any in-app controls - the default audio player's controls will suffice. </p>  <p>Is there a simple way to accomplish this, or am I missing the big picture? I'd take help in either C# or Objective C.</p>
