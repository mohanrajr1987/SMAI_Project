<p>There is an error with the Download cache plugin while building with the beta or alpha Xamarin build for iOS 9. Link : <a href="https://forums.xamarin.com/discussion/50777/build-error-mtouch-mt2001-on-os-x-el-capitan-gm-with-xamarin-alpha-release" rel="nofollow">https://forums.xamarin.com/discussion/50777/build-error-mtouch-mt2001-on-os-x-el-capitan-gm-with-xamarin-alpha-release</a> </p>  <p>Stuart, is this a plugin issue (plugin needs updating for ios9) or a Xamarin build issue? Thx! Any help appreciated. Currently not able to build and deploy.</p>
