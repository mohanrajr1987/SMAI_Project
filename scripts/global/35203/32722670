<p>I'm currently making an App using Xamarin Forms (C# + Xaml). The app will first grabs data from an API call then display the data. I also have an update button where if I click on it, it will call the API once again for newer data and supposedly replace the current data. I got everything to working up till the replace and displaying new data part. Is there anyway to do this? I was thinking of something like a transparent loading screen and when that's done, the data will be replaced. Any helps would be greatly appreciated.</p>
