<p>How can we design according to various resolutions in Xamarin forms application. I have been using Viewbox control for Windows application but it is not found in Xamarin forms.My requirement is, if I set 50 px for a control , it should scale up or down according to various resolutions. Please provide some design guide lines to achieve this. I have been using Grid row definitions and column definitions, but for some cases I have to manually set height / width or padding for some controls. Please help me.</p>
