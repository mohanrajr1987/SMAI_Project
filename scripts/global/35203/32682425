<p>I installed Xamarin Studio with <code>Xamarin.iOS</code> on my macbook (with retina). Created sample iOS tabbed app and it all works great. </p>  <p>Then on VM (same macbook) I installed <code>VS2015</code> with xamarin. Created the same sample iOS tabbed app and run it through <code>Xamarin.iOS Build Host</code>. It all works but... tab icons are not displayed correctly:/ </p>  <p>It should be circle and square:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/buox8.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/buox8.png" alt="how it should look"></a></p>  <p>And I have no circle and square will disappear when clicked :</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/AM9LO.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/AM9LO.png" alt="how it looks when built with VS"></a></p>  <p>So, my question is: Why is that happening?</p>
