<p>I am trying to display a UIAlertView with Xamarin.iOS (Monotouch). I am on the Main Thread and when running a Debug build it works fine.</p>  <p>However as soon as I switch to Release mode the Alert View will not show. Here is an example</p>  <pre><code>var erroralert1 = new UIAlertView("Location", "Test", null, "Ok", null); erroralert1.Show(); </code></pre>  <p>Do they not display in a Release build? Are UIAlertViews simple a Debug tool?</p>
