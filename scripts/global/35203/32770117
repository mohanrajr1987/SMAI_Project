<p>I've done a lot of searching and haven't really been able to stumble across anything extremely useful in really getting myself going with iOS development using Xamarin/C#.</p>  <p>For those who were once newbies like myself,  is there a recommended tutorial or online classes that anyone can recommend to really get me going?  Something that starts from a hello world type app up to a completed and somewhat useful app?  I've found nothing but hello world tutorials so these haven't been too useful.</p>  <p>I am proficient in C#/Visual studio and Windows software development and have been doing it quite some time now and I am trying to make the leap into mobile development.</p>
