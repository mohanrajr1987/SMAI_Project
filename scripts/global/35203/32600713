<p>In my Xamarin Forms iOS application the previous page name is also appearing with the back button in all pages. Is there any way to hide the title of the previous page?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/6NhK4.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/6NhK4.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
