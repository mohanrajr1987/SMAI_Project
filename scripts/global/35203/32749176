<p>I've been using the Google Plus and Play Games Xamarin Component <a href="https://components.xamarin.com/view/googleplusandplayios" rel="nofollow">(link)</a> in the iOS version of my cross-platform app. I haven't had any trouble uploading it to the store in the past, but after upgrading to Xcode7, I receive the following error when trying to submit my .ipa through Application Loader:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>ERROR ITMS-90535: "Unexpected CFBundleExecutable Key. The bundle at 'Payload/Brushfire.iOS.app/GooglePlus.bundle/GPPShareboxSharedResources.bundle' does not contain a bundle executable. If this bundle intentionally does not contain an executable, consider removing the CFBundleExecutable key from its Info.plist and using a CFBundlePackageType of BNDL. If this bundle is part of a third-party framework, consider contacting the developer of the framework for an update to address this issue."</p> </blockquote>  <p>Since this is a Xamarin Component, I don't believe I have access to the plist file to change this value, so I can't use the solution posed in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32622899/itms-90535-unable-to-publish-ios-app-with-latest-google-signin-sdk">ITMS-90535 Unable to publish iOS app with latest Google Signin SDK</a>. I don't want to have to wait for an update to the component from Xamarin. Are there any workarounds that could help me get my app into the store?</p>
