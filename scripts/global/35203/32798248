<p>I am building an app in Xamarin.Forms which has bluetooth functionality. After I have connected to a device, I have an <code>ObsevableCollection</code> which collects the available Services. I then want to select the service I am looking for.</p>  <p>The uses the <a href="https://github.com/xamarin/Monkey.Robotics/tree/master/Getting%20Started/Mobile_Stack" rel="nofollow"><code>Monkey.Robotics</code></a> plugin, and is based on the sample <a href="https://github.com/conceptdev/xamarin-forms-samples/blob/master/BluetoothHeartRateMonitor/" rel="nofollow">HeartRate Monitor</a> App. At the moment, there is a </p>  <pre><code>this.services = new ObservableCollection&lt;IService&gt; (); listView.ItemsSource = services;  // when device is connected adapter.DeviceConnected += (s, e) =&gt; {     device = e.Device;       // when services are discovered     device.ServicesDiscovered += (object se, EventArgs ea) =&gt; {          if (services.Count == 0)  //if it's only just started             Device.BeginInvokeOnMainThread(() =&gt; {                 foreach (var service in device.Services) {                     services.Add(service); //add all new services found to ObservableCollection                 }             });     };      // start looking for services     device.DiscoverServices ();  }; </code></pre>  <p>So the current code retrieves all services and puts them into an <code>ObservableCollection</code>, which then populates a list view. Rather than populating a list and waiting for a user input, I want to search the results for the service I want. i.e. </p>  <pre><code>await Task.Delay (5000); // wait 5 seconds for the scan to complete IService ChosenService = null;  try {         foreach(var data in services)         {             if (data!=null &amp;&amp; data.ID!=null &amp;&amp; data.ID.ToString() == 0x180D.ToString()){ ChosenService = data; break; }          }     }     catch {              Debug.WriteLine ("Exception");     }      Debug.WriteLineIf(ChosenService == null, "Not Chosen"); </code></pre>  <h1>Third Update:</h1>  <p>I have added the try, catch block as show above and also added the checks to make sure we aren't working with null references. This all compiles, and the app doesn't crash at any point! However, the process ends with  ChosenService = null? So this code isn't working. Any Ideas why not? The Service scan seems to be working, as in the debug window, I get the following feedback:</p>  <pre><code>2015-09-26 22:09:38.329 Gas_SenseiOS[1431:605554] Device.Discovered Service: &lt;CBService: 0x12832e7e0, isPrimary = YES, UUID = Heart Rate&gt; 2015-09-26 22:09:38.333 Gas_SenseiOS[1431:605554] Device.Discovered Service: &lt;CBService: 0x12831c950, isPrimary = YES, UUID = Device Information&gt; 2015-09-26 22:09:38.349 Gas_SenseiOS[1431:605554] Device.Discovered Service: &lt;CBService: 0x12832e7e0, isPrimary = YES, UUID = Heart Rate&gt; 2015-09-26 22:09:38.350 Gas_SenseiOS[1431:605554] Device.Discovered Service: &lt;CBService: 0x12831c950, isPrimary = YES, UUID = Device Information&gt; 2015-09-26 22:09:38.352 Gas_SenseiOS[1431:605554] Device.Discovered Service: &lt;CBService: 0x12832e7e0, isPrimary = YES, UUID = Heart Rate&gt; 2015-09-26 22:09:38.352 Gas_SenseiOS[1431:605554] Device.Discovered Service: &lt;CBService: 0x12831c950, isPrimary = YES, UUID = Device Information&gt; </code></pre>
