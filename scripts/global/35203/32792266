<p>I've got a cross platform Xamarin app. There's a PCL project, an Android project, and an iOS project. When I build the iOS portion, it complains that "MTOUCH" is having a problem. "Failed to resolve System.Runtime.Serialization.XsdDataContractExporter reference from System.Runtime.Serialization ...</p>  <p>My Xamarin studio has recently updated to the latest iOS 9 code. Is that related? I also started to use some Newtonsoft.Json code, but I commented out all of the JSON code and it doesn't seem to help. </p>  <p>Any ideas where this error is coming from? I tried googling and I get nothing helpful. </p>
