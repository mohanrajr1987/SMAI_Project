<p>Does anyone know if we can design our custom <code>UIViews</code> in Xamarin's <code>storyboards</code> ? I would like to use <code>autolayout</code> and <code>size classes</code> for a custom View that I need to develop. I am not much comfortable with Xcode, having been so attached to Xamarin's IB. So I would prefer to design it in Xamarin <code>storyboards</code> than going for <code>XIB</code> files. I know we can prototype <code>UITableViewCells</code> in storyboards, but that is not what I want. I want a standalone custom UIView, with a code-behind class that I can re-use.</p>
