<p>I have a <code>UIView</code>, in which I have one <code>UILabel</code>. I would like to change the <code>UILabel.Font</code> to a custom <code>UIFont</code> when the <code>UIView</code> is tapped (This enlarges the tappable area instead of using a <code>UIButton</code>).</p>  <p>To add the <code>UITapGestureRecognizer</code>, I use the following code:</p>  <pre><code>var gestureRecognizer = new UITapGestureRecognizer ((item) =&gt; {     (item.View.Subviews[0] as UILabel).Font = Constants_iOS.FONT_OS_SMALL_LABEL_SEMIBOLD; }); view.AddGestureRecognizer (gestureRecognizer); </code></pre>  <p>The font change gets executed, and stepping through the code shows the font changing. But it does not update in the UI, and all subsequent executions of the function also start with the <code>Font</code> being the old one.</p>  <p>What is going wrong?</p>
