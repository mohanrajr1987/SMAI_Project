<p>I'm trying to align the text to the right in <strong>MonoTouch.Dialog.StringElement</strong></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/kdHuk.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/kdHuk.png" alt="Snapshot from my stringElement"></a></p>  <p><strong>TextAlignment</strong> is not working with me!! :( .. I'm adding it to a <strong>Section</strong> then to the <strong>DialogViewModel</strong> ... It's appearing in UI but with wrong <strong>TextAlignment</strong> .. What should I do?</p>  <p>Note: The font changed perfectly, this is what <strong>FontHelper</strong> is doing</p>
