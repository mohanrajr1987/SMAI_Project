<p>We are working on Xamarin forms project. For this we're using <strong>Parse</strong> as backend for our Xamarin forms project. We are using REST APIs to connect to the PARSE backend. We are testing this app on both Android and iOS devices. <strong>On iOS devices, the app is taking very long time to connect to REST APIs whereas the same code is working perfectly fine in android</strong>. (in Android it takes less than 3 seconds, in iOS its more than 10 seconds for the same API call).</p>  <p>We are using Xamarin forms so the code base is common for iOS and Android.</p>  <p>We have recently updated to Xamarin studio version 5.9.7 (build 9) and after this update, above stated problem has appeared.</p>  <p>We've also posted the same question <a href="https://forums.xamarin.com/discussion/49768/xamarin-ios-build-seems-to-be-running-slower-than-usual#latest" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>  <p>Could you please check and let us know if there is any known issue in new build?</p>
