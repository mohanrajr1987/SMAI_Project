<p>I'm trying to use a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix-Di0qRu9c" rel="nofollow">Qt-based library</a> within a Xamarin.iOS project. As a first step, I'd like to</p>  <ol> <li>initialize a simple Qt View and</li> <li>place it in an empty ViewController.</li> </ol>  <p>I already managed to link the iOS project with QtCore and QtGui. Now I'm struggling with binding Qt's C++ methods with corresponding C# calls.</p>  <p>Has anyone experience with the combination of Xamarin <em>and</em> Qt? <br /> Is this the way to go at all? <br /> (All I can find on the web is about Xamarin <em>vs.</em> Qt...)</p>
