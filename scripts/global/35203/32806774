<p>I am building a BLE app in Xamain.Forms. I am using an adapter which triggers a number of methods based on events, for example <code>adapter.DeviceDiscovered</code> etc. The process goes: </p>  <ol> <li>Scan for Devices </li> <li>Connect to chosen device</li> <li>Scan for <code>Services</code> present on device</li> <li>Select a <code>Service</code></li> <li>Scan for <code>Characteristics</code> on device</li> </ol>  <p>I am working on step 5 now and have the following code:</p>  <pre><code>ChosenService.CharacteristicsDiscovered += (object sender, EventArgs e) =&gt; {     Debug.WriteLine("service.CharacteristicsDiscovered");     if (characteristics.Count == 0)         Device.BeginInvokeOnMainThread(() =&gt; {             foreach (var characteristic in ChosenService.Characteristics) {                 characteristics.Add(characteristic);             }         }); }; </code></pre>  <p>However, as <code>ChosenService</code> is null until step 4 is complete, on the opening of the app, this method throws a <code>Object reference not set to an instance of an object</code> exception. How can I work around this? Ideally, I suppose I need to read the method after I have set <code>ChosenService</code>, how should I do this? </p>
