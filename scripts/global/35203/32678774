<p>Our app uses RestSharp which uses <code>HttpWebRequest</code> under the covers.</p>  <p>When switching from wifi to 3g or from airplane mode to 3g, we lose connection - we can no longer make http calls using RestSharp.</p>  <p>I understand this is a problem with the mono http implementation on iOS and according to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4592150/monotouch-webrequest-connection-fails-after-switching-off-airplane-mode-on-ipho">this question</a> the way to solve it is to use <code>StartWWAN</code>.</p>  <p>Currently I'm calling <code>StartWWAN</code> whenever I detect that network connectivity has changed. While I'm calling it, I'm making sure I don't perform any http requests.</p>  <p>It works only when my phone is connected to a power source. It doesn't work when it's not.</p>  <p>Can someone please explain when am I supposed to call <code>StartWWAN</code>?</p>
