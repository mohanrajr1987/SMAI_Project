<p>I'm developing an iOS app in Xamarin (<strong>not using Forms, using Xamarin.iOS</strong>) and I have noticed that the keyboard which appears in my Xamarin built app is larger than Keyboards which appear in other apps.</p>  <p>E.G. My app</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ydfEt.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ydfEt.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>E.G. Other iOS app (Apple Notes)</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/KGSt0.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/KGSt0.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>The numbers aren't really important, what is important is that there is definitely a difference in size between the two keyboards in terms of key height and key spacing.</p>  <p>There does not appear to be any obvious options or settings surrounding this. Trying different Keyboard Styles (I'm using "Default") does not solve the problem.</p>  <p>I would like to get my Keyboard to be the same size as a normal iOS App Keyboard.</p>  <hr>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>  <p>Krumelur's answer is correct.</p>  <p>This is how I specified the launch screens</p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/25960203/807836">http://stackoverflow.com/a/25960203/807836</a></p>  <p>In Visual Studio, there does appear to be an issue with this XML entry being lost if you edit the project file through the IDE.</p>
