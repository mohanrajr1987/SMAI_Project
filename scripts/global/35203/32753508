<p>I have a cross platform (Xamrin) app that does some classic Bluetooth communication and is working absolutely fine on iOS8. However, after re-building and running it on iOS9 I can't get the NSInputStream to ever have "HasBytesAvailable"= true. Note: <a href="https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/ios/platform_features/ios9/" rel="nofollow">I followed all the instructions from Xamarin's website.</a></p>  <p>I tried both assigning a delegate to the InputStream and waiting on the NSRunLoop but the stream never seems to have bytes available. The event only fires (on iOS9) when the Input stream is opened (on iOS8 it fires as expected).</p>  <p>Here is a snippet of the code that does the reading successfully on iOS8 (delegate method):</p>  <pre><code>EAsession.InputStream.Delegate = new Foo();     EAsession.InputStream.Schedule(NSRunLoop.Current,NSRunLoop.NSDefaultRunLoopMode);     EAsession.InputStream.Open();                (NSRunLoop.Current).RunUntil(NSDate.FromTimeIntervalSinceNow(2)); </code></pre>  <p>Where <strong>Foo</strong> is a class that implements:  NSObject, INSStreamDelegate</p>  <pre><code>    public class Foo :NSObject, INSStreamDelegate {     [Export("stream:handleEvent:")]     public void HandleEvent(Foundation.NSStream theStream, Foundation.NSStreamEvent streamEvent)     {       //Code to read bytes here     } </code></pre>  <p>To make sure there really are bytes sent to the iPhone5 I modified the external Bluetooth device to just echo any bytes received. </p>  <p>Using either method (delegate or waiting on NSRunLoop) on iOS8, the echo arrives immediately. However when I change the target device to the iOS9 I can wait forever and HasBytesAvailable would always be false.</p>  <p>I even tried reading regardless of HasBytesAvailable being false, but nothing is being read (no big surprise there I guess).</p>  <p>Moreover, I tried building using both Xcode6.4 and Xcode 7 with same result.</p>  <p>At the moment I am out of ideas so any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>  <p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>  <p>I contacted Xamarin and I am writing a test app for them to test whether it is an Apple issue or Xamarin issue. </p>  <p>Also, see the comment in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/releasenotes/General/RN-iOSSDK-9.0/" rel="nofollow">this link</a> about Bluetooth... perhaps related? </p>
