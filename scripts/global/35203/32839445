<p>I've been banging my head against a wall here.</p>  <p>I have a xamarin app that uses mvvmlight. It's close to completition, but it's been pointed out that the network activity spinner is not showing on any platform.</p>  <p>Understanding that this is a platform specific operation, is there a way I can bind the button that triggers the the spinner and on return from the network activity, cancel the spinner?</p>  <p>I did consider something like</p>  <pre><code>this.BtnDoSomething.SetCommand(Events.Click, () =&gt; {startSpinner; this.ViewModel.DoStuff}); </code></pre>  <p>but that won't call back on completion to remove the spinner.</p>
