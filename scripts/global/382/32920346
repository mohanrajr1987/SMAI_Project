<p>I am having tons of trouble with this issue. I'm taking a WordPress course, and I'm on the final part... moving it from my localhost to a live server.</p>  <p>After doing so, however, my background images do not appear. At first, my whole media library was broken, but I was able to fix that. I can't seem to figure out the issue with the background images though.</p>  <p>I've been scouring multiple forums looking for an answer before posting here... but I can't seem to find it, or understand it, so I thought I'd ask for help regarding my specific situation.</p>  <p>Here is a link to the current, live WordPress site: <a href="http://176.32.230.251/znbootstraptowordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">http://176.32.230.251/znbootstraptowordpress.com/</a></p>  <p>And here is a link to the static site, so you can see what background images are missing: <a href="http://176.32.230.251/b2wzachnagatani.com/" rel="nofollow">http://176.32.230.251/b2wzachnagatani.com/</a></p>  <p>Thanks in advance for any help!</p>
