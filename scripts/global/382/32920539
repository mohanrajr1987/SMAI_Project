<p>I have coded a site that I am proud of in PHP. Everything is working fine. But I was told the site needs to be built around CakePHP. </p>  <p>I am somewhat new to building dynamic websites so am not sure if he's correct or not. Right now, if I want to see the data, I go to PHPMyAdmin. If I want to operate on the code, I just open up the PHP files. </p>  <p>Is there a better way that I don't know about? I am not sure why I should re-code the site in CakePHP. Should I? Please explain.</p>  <p>Also, does CakePHP come with certain design templates like Wordpress?</p>
