<p>I migrated my wordpress blog onto another server and now I cannot upload any images in my wordpress media library anyomre. The permission for my directory "uploads" is set to 755, so that shouldn't be the issue. I even changed it to 777 but without any success. Can you please give me a hint what to look for? I could not find an appropriate solution, the only advise seems to change permission to 755 in SSH which does not work for me.</p>
