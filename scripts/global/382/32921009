<p>I have never come across this before and it's completely stumped me!</p>  <p>I am using some custom front end posting scripts in Wordpress, these work absolutely fine, everything is escaped correctly before the data is saved to the db etc, but I seem to be having an issue with the apostrophe (single quote) when entered on a Mac keyboard.</p>  <p>An example post using various chars is entered in the text area :</p>  <pre><code> a post with other chars `~":;?/[]{}-_=+!£$%^&amp;*()' </code></pre>  <p>And this is what is saved in the db (and then displayed on the page when called) :</p>  <pre><code> a post with other chars `~":;?/[]{}-_=+!£$%^&amp;*()&amp;#039; </code></pre>  <p>This is how the data is being saved to the db for clarity :</p>  <pre><code>esc_attr(strip_tags($_POST['postContent'])), </code></pre>  <p>If I copy and paste an apostrophe from a webpage like this for example it saves just fine :</p>  <pre><code> Ain’t that strange! </code></pre>  <p>But that slanted apostrophe isn't available (as standard) on the Mac keyboard, the default is the single quote '</p>  <p>I have never come across this issue before.</p>  <p>Anybody got any suggestions or workarounds as I'm at my wits end!</p>
