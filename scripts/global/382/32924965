<p>I am using the following to prevent unauthorized access to files. (This is an .htaccess question, but may also require familiarity with WP Jetpack)</p>  <p>RewriteRule ^wp-content/uploads/archive/(.*)$ /wp-content/plugins/paid-memberships-pro/services/getfile.php [L]</p>  <p>It redirects request for files through a module that checks to see if the requestor has access.</p>  <p>The problem is that a specific requestor, Wordpress Jetpack is locked out and I want to let them in to generate thumbnail images.</p>  <p>If you are familiar with Wordpress Jetpack, you know it generates image thumbnails such as <a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.example.com/wp-content/uploads/archive/2015/10/SH3_2173.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i0.wp.com/www.example.com/wp-content/uploads/archive/2015/10/SH3_2173.jpg</a></p>  <p>To solve this, I assume I need two pieces of information:</p>  <ol> <li>How to identify when Jetpack is the one making the request (perhaps it is identified as coming from the wp.com domain?)</li> <li>How to exclude a specific entity (e.g. wp.com) from the above RewriteRule</li> </ol>  <p>Part 1 is really a WP Jetpack question, and part 2 is an .htaccess question; so not sure the best place to post this, but I felt keeping them together would be helpful for context.</p>
