<p>I'm curious as to others' workflow involving <strong>Git and WordPress</strong>, and whether or not you choose to install <strong>WordPress</strong> as a <em>submodule</em>. At first glance, it makes sense to keep my <strong>Theme, Plugins, and Uploads</strong> separate from the <em>wp core</em> files and easier to <em>update/maintain</em> over time.</p>  <p>Does anyone have any long-term experience and advice when it comes to developing <strong>WP with Git</strong>?</p>  <p>Does installing <strong>WP as a Submodule</strong> create any challenges when uploading the site to the Live Server?</p>
