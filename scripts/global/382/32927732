<p>I have a page within WordPress called 'Gallery', the page ID is 128, and I need to display only the gallery images from that page on a different page with a different ID. The images were uploaded using the standard WordPress gallery functionality.</p>  <p>I've been trying to use <code>get_children</code> and a <code>foreach</code> loop to achieve it, but I can't seem to get only the gallery images from the page I need (ID 128).</p>  <p>Here's what I have so far:</p>  <pre><code>$images = get_children( array(      'post_parent'    =&gt; 128,      'post_type'      =&gt; 'attachment',      'post_mime_type' =&gt; 'image',      'orderby'        =&gt; 'menu_order',      'order'          =&gt; 'ASC',      'numberposts'    =&gt; 999  ) );  if ( $images ) {      // looping through the images     foreach ( $images as $attachment_id =&gt; $attachment ) {         echo wp_get_attachment_image( $attachment_id, 'full' );     } } </code></pre>  <p>How can I display gallery images from a WordPress page, on a different page?</p>
