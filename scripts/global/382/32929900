<p>I was helping a friend to make his WordPress website a bit more friendly, and I got stuck when I tried to make an AJAX request to a particular PHP file he has.</p>  <p>Given a custom theme with the following structure:</p>  <pre><code>-- header.php -- -- aside.php -- -- template.php -- footer.php </code></pre>  <p>Is there a way to make a request to a particular PHP file, instead of making a request for a full webpage (e.g instead of a request to <code>/about-us/</code>, something like <code>/template.php?p=2</code>)?</p>
