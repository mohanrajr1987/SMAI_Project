<p>I'm pretty new to wordpress and currently working on a portfolio website for my photographer friend. I decided to use the plugin "Envira Gallery" to show his pictures on the website.</p>  <p>However when i upload the pictures to one of the pages, they never appear - however if you inspect elements you can see the html code there. I tried disabling all plugins without success. I then tried changing to the twentytwelve theme and it worked!</p>  <p>So i am aware it is a problem on my theme causing it, i just have no idea what, so i hoped you guys could help.</p>  <p>Website: <a href="http://www.albydota.com/wp" rel="nofollow">http://www.albydota.com/wp</a>  (media is supposed to be under photos &amp; videoer tabs).</p>
