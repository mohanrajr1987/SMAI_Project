<p>Whenever I copy a contact form 7 short code onto a page it works - but whenever I then change the permalink settings in Wordpress from 'default' to 'Post name' I get a <code>404 Not Found</code> error whenever I visit the contact form url.</p>  <p>I saw that the poster <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10047823/wordpress-contact-form-7-returns-404-but-works-on-homepage">here</a> has a similar problem - where the answer suggests changing the permalink settings and then changing them back. Changing them to 'default' makes everything work again indeed, however, changing back to 'Post name' after that doesn't solve the issue (and I would like to have this nonetheless). Does anyone know a solution?</p>  <p>It seems that the people <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/contact-form-7-doesnt-work-with-permalink" rel="nofollow">here</a> have the same problem (but no solution).</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
