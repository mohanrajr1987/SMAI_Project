<p>I am developing a website for a car rental company and am using a subdomain for testing. The site is very slow on all browsers (and on the backend) despite high score on Pingdom, PageSpeed Insights, and GTmetrix. I'm not new to WordPress and page speed and have been able to achieve speed with the use of plugins and the right hosting.</p>  <p>I am using the Avada theme with the following plugins (I have already removed each plugin individually to see if any one of them was the culprit):</p>  <p>Autoptimize JCH Optimize Ninja Forms Justified Image Grid W3 Total Cache (used with maxCDN) WP Migrate DB WP-Optimize wpMandrill</p>  <p>Our hosting provider is HostGator but I want to use Pagely. </p>  <p>Here is our <a href="http://newsitetest.regencycarrentals.com/" rel="nofollow">Site</a></p>  <p>I just tested it out on pingdom and scored a 91/100.</p>  <p>Also, pages with very little content, such as our contact page, run slow as well.</p>  <p>FYI, this is a test site so you might find random pics of my dog in strange locations.</p>
