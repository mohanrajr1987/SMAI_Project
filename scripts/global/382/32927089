<p>Here is my site, <a href="http://www.defensionem.com/schwellenpflug/" rel="nofollow">http://www.defensionem.com/schwellenpflug/</a></p>  <p>I want to shift the text from both the directions in the middle. So as the text is in the center and is easy to read and looks good. I can only add custom CSS so please advice.</p>  <p>Using Firebug,</p>  <p>I tried this: </p>  <pre><code>.main-content{ padding-left:250px; } </code></pre>  <p>Which works but it isn't exactly in the middle. I tried changing the padding values and noticed it also has to do something with the sidebar side.</p>  <p>I'm confused.</p>  <p>I tried text-align:center; but it only aligns the format of the text and doesn't bring it in the middle.</p>
