<p>I'm using visual editor as Widget, and i create google fonts in order to choose the letter, color , basically control the fonts.</p>  <p>But i'm not understanding why do I have so many space between lines. How you can see in the picture, I have a lot of space Between Morada and Rua da Pra√ßa. And again between 7645 Vila Mova.</p>  <p>can you explain me where and how can I control that space? <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/qh8bk.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/qh8bk.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
