<p>I have downloaded a wordPress theme known as zerif lite as the theme author doesn't allow us to customize it according to our needs as its a demo version. Now I want to modify it a lot outside of wordPress inshort  i want to make a different theme of my own way lot different than the original . As i'm expert in html5 css3 and javascript. Any suggestions how to make a theme work (based on html5 css3 and javascript) on wordPress ?</p>  <p>Every suggestion or solution will be highly appreciated.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
