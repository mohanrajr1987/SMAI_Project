<p>This is going to be a lot of questions in one. I am very confused with facebook. I have a facebook page and I am trying to integrate facebook comments in my WordPress site with this plugin: <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/facebook-comments-plugin/" rel="nofollow">Facebook Comments</a>. This plugin asks me for an API key and sends me to the page <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/apps/" rel="nofollow">https://developers.facebook.com/apps/</a> in order to create an app and get an API key. But when I try to create an app it tells me: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Not Authorized To Manage Apps This account is not authorized to manage   apps. Please use your verified personal Facebook account to create and   manage your apps.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I have been investigating and seems that my problem is because I have a business account on  facebook. So my questions are: - How works facebook comments in WordPress? are comments made in WordPress published in facebook, facebook comments are going to be published in my WordPress or both of them? - Is there a way to integrate facebook comments on my website with a business account? - If I create the page with my personal profile and then create an app to integrate the comments in facebook, will this facebook comments on WordPress go to be related to my profile or to my page?</p>  <p>Like you can see, I am very confused on how to go about connecting WordPress and facebook. Any extra explanation apart from this questions about facebook pages and how to connect with WordPress will be great.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
