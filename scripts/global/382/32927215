<p>I'm using a free Wordpress theme on my newly created blog and I've got a couple of questions. </p>  <p>I want to center the title and the arrow that opens the menu panel in a proper way (The ones indicated here <a href="http://imgur.com/81a27VF" rel="nofollow">http://imgur.com/81a27VF</a>). </p>  <p>How do I go about doing that? I know a bit of HTML and CSS but I don't know how Wordpress themes are laid out this I don't want to mess up with the whole theme and.</p>  <p>Also the theme itself has a footer with the themes name on it, am I allowed to change it?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
