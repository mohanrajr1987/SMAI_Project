<p>How do I save inputed information in multiple uitextfields? and when I switch between viewcontrollers how does the inputed information stay within its uitextfields when switching back and forward? perhaps set within a time frame which then resets itself?</p>  <p>I want the uitextfields to be set automatically without using the "load" function to recall the information back. </p>  <p>Can I see an example in "view controller.swift" thanks.</p>  <p>I am using Xcode 7 - Swift 2.</p>
