<p>I have a custom UITextfield that is x-centered to its superview via a constraint. It also has a height-constraint and a nice thin line right under the text that has the same width as the textfield itself (like I said: custom). I now want to keep the UITextfield centered while editing its content, adjusting itself in width to its string content.</p>  <p>What right now happens is that it keeps its width while editing, cropping its overlapping content.</p>  <p>My code is kind of</p>  <pre><code>// on textfields editing change event @IBAction func nameFieldEditingChanged(sender: AnyObject) {     // set width of textfield to width of textstring     checkUserNameTextfieldWidth() }  func checkUserNameTextfieldWidth(){     println("checkUserNameTextfieldWidth \(userName.text) / \(userName.frame.size.width) / \(view.bounds.width)")      // something has to happen here I guess...  } </code></pre>  <p>Thnx!</p>
