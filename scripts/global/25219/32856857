<p>I have a scroll view overlaid by two text fields, one near the top and one near the bottom. When text in the text field reaches the side constraints the app freezes up and does not adjust the size to fit the width.  Initially, I had a image view overlaid by two text fields and it was working properly. I think this has some relation to the scroll view. </p>  <p>In the interface builder, Adjust to Fit is checked and min font size set. I also have used the following statements and no avail.</p>  <pre><code>    topTextField.adjustsFontSizeToFitWidth = true     bottomTextField.adjustsFontSizeToFitWidth = true </code></pre>  <p>Below is a screen shot of the app when it freezes up and screen shot of the layout in Xcode.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/xKiH3.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/xKiH3.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Bh7ME.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Bh7ME.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
