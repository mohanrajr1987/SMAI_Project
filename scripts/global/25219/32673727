<p>I am able to detect when a cell is removed from the <em>UITableView</em> by writing a handler for the method <em>tableView:didEndDisplayingCell:forRowAtIndexPath:</em>.  This method is called whenever a cell is removed from the display.  However, there is one exception.  </p>  <p>When the cell has a <em>UITextField</em> and the field is the first responder, this method is never called even when it's scrolled off the display and the cells immediately before it and after it are.</p>  <p>The cell is also confirmed to be removed from the <em>UITableView</em> with a test while the cell is scrolled off the screen.  The call to <em>cellForRowAtIndexPath:</em> returns nil under this condition.  </p>  <p>I also subclassed the <em>UITableViewCell</em> and wrote a handler for removeFromSuperView.  Again this method is called for all the cells when the are scrolled off the screen except when the cell has a <em>UITextField</em> and it is the first responder. </p>  <p>Another thing to note is that the <em>UITextField</em> in the cell accepts key input while it is scrolled off the screen and the call to <em>cellForRowAtIndexPath:</em> returns nil.  I can see this when the cell is scrolled back into view.</p>  <p>Does anyone have any solutions for detecting when the cell is scrolled out of view, so that the controller can get access to the <em>UITextField</em>?</p>
