<p>I've added a simple UITextView and i placed it where i want to in the storyboard, then i click on add missing contraints/reset to suggested and it doesn't show up on the screen when i run it, i don't know why its not working</p>  <p>this is what i get in the debugger. </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Unable to simultaneously satisfy constraints.           Probably at least one of the constraints in the following list is one you don't want. Try this: (1) look at each constraint and try to figure out which you don't expect; (2) find the code that added the unwanted constraint or constraints and fix it. (Note: If you're seeing NSAutoresizingMaskLayoutConstraints that you don't understand, refer to the documentation for the UIView property translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints)        (           "&lt;_UILayoutSupportConstraint:0x15ed61540 V:[_UILayoutGuide:0x15eee5f50(20)]>",           "&lt;_UILayoutSupportConstraint:0x15ed0c500 V:|-(0)-[_UILayoutGuide:0x15eee5f50]   (Names: '|':UIView:0x15eee5df0 )>",           "",           "",           "" )<br></p>      <p>Will attempt to recover by breaking constraint        </p>      <p>Make a symbolic breakpoint at UIViewAlertForUnsatisfiableConstraints to catch this in the debugger.       The methods in the UIConstraintBasedLayoutDebugging category on UIView listed in  may also be helpful.</p> </blockquote>
