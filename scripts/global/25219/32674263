<p>How is it possible to create a custom <code>UIControl</code> to behave similar to a <code>UITextField</code>? I don't want to do a lot with my text field for now but I have a custom <code>UIInputViewController</code> which should be able to access certain properties of my custom <code>UIControl</code> via its <code>textDocumentProxy</code> property. For example: I don't actually have a string as content of my custom <code>UIControl</code> but it should be a linked list of a custom class. How can I now achieve the following things:</p>  <ul> <li>Add text (<code>UIKeyInput</code>)</li> <li>Remove text at current insertion point (<code>UIKeyInput</code>)</li> <li>Move insertion point (How do I do this? I don't know which methods <code>UITextDocumentProxy</code> calls when calling <code>adjustTextPositionByCharacterOffset</code>)</li> <li>Get information from my custom class about the current text (don't know how <code>UITextDocumentProxy</code> behaves with <code>documentContextBeforeInput</code> either -- I <strong>could</strong> use an extension on the <code>UIKeyInput</code> protocol but this seems and is incredibly ugly)</li> <li>Provide a custom <code>inputView</code> to behave like a custom keyboard</li> </ul>  <p>Basically, I could subclass <code>UITextField</code> as well, if it is possible to hide the cursor e.g.</p>  <p>Is there a nice tutorial for anything of this on the Internet? If someone could answer some questions of mine, I would be greatly thankful, thanks in advance.</p>
