<p>The clear button of UITextField gets hidden in iOS 9, it was working perfectly till now in all other iOS versions. I tried out everything from the below links :</p>  <p>(1). <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18369473/uitextfield-clear-button-does-not-show">UITextField Clear Button Does Not Show</a> (2). <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27944781/how-to-change-the-tint-color-of-the-clear-button-on-a-uitextfield">How to change the tint color of the clear button on a UITextField</a> (3). <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10274210/uitextfield-clearbuttonmode-color">UITextField clearButtonMode color</a></p>  <p>The button does not show up till we hover the mouse over its position. In storyboard, I have selected "appears while editing" option and even tried "is always visible" option, but still the same.</p>  <p>I don't want to create custom button, so please let me know is there anything wrong in iOS 9 or what else can be done to resolve.</p>  <p>Waiting for a positive reply.</p>  <p>Thanks !!</p>
