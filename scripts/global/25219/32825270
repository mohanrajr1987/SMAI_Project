<p>I'm migrating a project from iOS 7.0/8.0 to 8.0/9.0 and I'm facing this problem : </p>  <p>Any <code>UITextField</code> I have on my UI freezes the app but doesn't trigger a crash.</p>  <p>I've tried to remove delegates, even <code>IBOutlet</code>s. I've created a new empty controller, with just one <code>UITextField</code>, that my appDelegate shows instead of any other, but nothing works...</p>  <p>Is anyone facing the same issue ?</p>
