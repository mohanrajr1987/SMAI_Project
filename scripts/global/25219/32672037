<p>I have a series of form fields (UITextField) that have as their "Done" action (which I changed to "Next") the ability to set the firstResponder to the next field down the line, such that when a user is filling out the field they can click next to keep progressing:  </p>  <pre><code>fields[i-1].addTarget(fields[i], action: "becomeFirstResponder", forControlEvents: UIControlEvents.EditingDidEndOnExit) </code></pre>  <p>However, in the middle of the form I have a field with a datePicker as the inputView, and I want that same functionality when the user selects a date:</p>  <p>[![enter image description here][1]][1]</p>  <p>So basically, the user would select a date and the .EditingDidEndOnExit would fire, which would be handled appropriately by the code above.</p>
