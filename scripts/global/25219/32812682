<p>I'm pretty new to Swift and I have a problem that I don't know how to solve. So, I have a <code>UITextField</code> where I have a limit of 5 characters max in the text field and I have no problems with stopping on fifth character, but the problem is that I can't clear text, because clear button probably consider to be a character in iOS. </p>  <p>Anyone can help me to solve this problem?</p>  <p>Here is my code:</p>  <pre><code>func textField(textField: UITextField,            shouldChangeCharactersInRange range: NSRange,            replacementString string: String) -&gt; Bool{      if let count = textField.text?.characters.count {         if count &lt; 5 {             print("\(count)")             return true         }         else {             return false         }     }     return true } </code></pre>  <p>Thanks.</p>
