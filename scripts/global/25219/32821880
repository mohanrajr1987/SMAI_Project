<p>In my test I have a text field with a pre-existing text. I want to delete the content and type a new string.</p>  <pre><code>let textField = app.textFields textField.tap() // delete "Old value" textField.typeText("New value") </code></pre>  <p>When deleting string with hardware keyboard Recording generated for me nothing. After doing the same with software keyboard I got:</p>  <pre><code>let key = app.keys["Usuń"] // Polish name for the key key.tap() key.tap()  ... // x times </code></pre>  <p>or</p>  <pre><code>app.keys["Usuń"].pressForDuration(1.5) </code></pre>  <p>I was worried that my test is language-dependent so I have created something like this for my supported languages:</p>  <pre><code>extension XCUIElementQuery {     var deleteKey: XCUIElement {         get {             // Polish name for the key             if self["Usuń"].exists {                 return self["Usuń"]             } else {                 return self["Delete"]             }         }     } } </code></pre>  <p>It looks nicer in code:</p>  <pre><code>app.keys.deleteKey.pressForDuration(1.5) </code></pre>  <p>but it is very fragile. After quitting from Simulator <code>Toggle software keyboard</code> was reset and I've got a failing test. My solution doesn't work well with CI testing. How can this be solved to be more universal?</p>
