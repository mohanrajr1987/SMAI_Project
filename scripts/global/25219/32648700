<p>I have a <code>UICollectionView</code> setup like a spreadsheet, with <code>UITextFields</code> in each <code>UICollectionViewCell</code>.  The first row of cells act as column headings with a <code>UILabel</code> each.  I'm aiming to update the heading cells with totals as the individual <code>UITextFields</code> are updated.  I could update the whole lot in one go, but it'd be smarter to just update the relevant column heading.  So...how can I determine which cell <code>UITextField</code> in the matrix has been updated? Since I can perform an action when editing has ended in the textfield, but I need to know what the indexPath was, to know which column heading total to recalculate.  Also the collection view is changing in size (variable number of sections and items).</p>
