<p>I want both my placeholder and typed text to be aligned in the center.</p>  <p>I tried both of these options for the two textfields I have, but still the placeholder and whatever I type are aligned left.</p>  <pre><code>self.teamA_name.textAlignment=NSTextAlignmentCenter; self.teamB_name.contentHorizontalAlignment = UIControlContentHorizontalAlignmentCenter; </code></pre>  <p>What am I missing?</p>  <p>Textfields are created through IB.</p>
