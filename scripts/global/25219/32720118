<p>Using <code>objective c</code> , and <code>UITextField</code>, i am trying to set a basic search engine. So when user starts to type a word, he will get a list of words from an xml file (or other such as json) , and as he continue typing ,the list will be changed to adapt . Much like google search box .</p>  <ol> <li><p>I guess i dont have to invent the wheel and a searching algorithm from an xml file has already be done- but i couldn't find one .</p></li> <li><p>Regarding the UI elements needed, i guess a search box with a built in list is something that already there also ?</p></li> </ol>  <p>thanks .</p>
