<p>I've got a test like below: </p>  <pre><code>let navnTextField = app.textFields["First Name"] let name = "Henrik" navnTextField.tap() navnTextField.typeText("Henrik") XCTAssertEqual(navnTextField.value as? String, name) </code></pre>  <p>Problem is that by default my <code>iPhone Simulator</code> has got Polish keyboard because of the system settings and "Henrik" is automatically changed into "ha" by autocorrect. </p>  <p>Simple solution is to remove Polish keyboard from the <code>iOS Settings</code>. This solution however is not solving the problem because <code>iPhone Simulator</code> can be reset and then test will fail again. </p>  <p>Is there any way to setup autocorrect before test case or other way to input text to text field. </p>
