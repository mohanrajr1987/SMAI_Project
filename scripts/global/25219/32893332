<p>I know that it is quite simple to call a function when a user presses the 'return' key on a keyboard, but I was wondering if something similar would be possible with any other key. In my case specifically, I would like to know when a user presses the 'comma'. I am trying to achieve functionality that looks something like what Mail on mac does in the address bar, where if you type a comma the text changes into a different view.</p>  <p>This is what I am referencing: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ntGlH.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ntGlH.png" alt="enter image description here"></a> <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Gd2zw.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Gd2zw.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
