<p>I am facing an issue with keyboard in iOS 9. I have a UItextfield in a <strong>table view cell</strong> which was working fine on iOS 8.x.x, once I updated to iOS 9 it is displaying a keyboard which is non-responsive. The keyboard is greyed out and tapping on the textfield for the second time opens a responsive keyboard. I am not sure why this is happening..  All other textfields in the application are working as expected...</p>
