<p>I have three textfields where the user enter their info. If the info format is not correct I will display a warning message in red color, then let them type in the new info. I tried to use a <code>while</code> loop to wait for their new info then go through the same <code>if</code> statements. If their new info is correct then once the button is pressed, we go to another storyboard. It didn't work for some reason. Can you tell me what I can do to display the warning message then wait for new input without going to the second storyboard just yet?</p>
