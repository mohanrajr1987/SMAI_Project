<p>I have a UIStepper connected to a UITextField. The stepper goes from 0 to 13. Whenever I click the stepper on the plus, I get "1" . I want to start with a 0. I tried many codes, but none of them worked, such as:</p>  <pre><code>@IBAction func stepperAc(sender: AnyObject) {      if textField.text == "" {      Stepper.value = 0      textField.text = 0    } } </code></pre>  <p>How can I do that ?</p>
