<p>I'm a little bit new to Python and for one of my research projects I needed a web scraper to scrape web content to create a dataset.</p>  <p>Since most of the threads suggested beautifulsoup package I tried building a web scraper based on Python.</p>  <p>Data I need to scrape is loaded after clicking a button on the web page. </p>  <p>Here's an Example:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/products/apple/iphone/6/" rel="nofollow">http://www.engadget.com/products/apple/iphone/6/</a></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/BpzkK.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/BpzkK.jpg" alt="Example"></a></p>  <p>When clicked on "12 Comments" A popup loads and comments are displayed. I need to scrape those comments.</p>  <p>I tried many ways but nothing seem to work so far. Can someone look into my code if there's anything to be done or suggest me another way of doing it?</p>  <pre><code>import bs4 import requests session = requests.Session() url = "http://www.engadget.com/products/apple/iphone/6/"  page  = session.get(url).text soup = bs4.BeautifulSoup(page, "html5lib") engadgetul = soup.find("ul", class_= "product-criteria-bars") engadgetdiv = engadgetul.find_all("div", class_="product-criteria-label") for engadgetrv in engadgetdiv:   review = engadgetrv.find_all("p", "comment-text") for rr in review:   print(rr.span.string) </code></pre>
