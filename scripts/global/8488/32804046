<p>I want to use Beautiful Soup to pull out anything with the following format:</p>  <pre><code>div class="dog-a b-cat" </code></pre>  <p>I can get a particular instance if I know what "a" and "b" are by doing the following (suppose <code>a=aardvark</code> and <code>b=boy</code>):</p>  <pre><code>soup.find_all("div",class_="dog-aardvark boy-cat") </code></pre>  <p>Is there any way I can pull out all instances (regardless of the two words between the dashes) with dog and cat and two dashes in between?</p>
