<p>I'm trying to find a way to use the <code>findAll</code> method to select table content based on <code>('tr',{'class':'expired'})</code> and the further qualify the row based on a cell containing <code>"XYZ"</code>.</p>  <p>It seems I could do it as a two step operation by first searching for <code>findAll('tr',{'class':'expired'})</code> and then taking those results and loop through them looking for td values of "XYZ" but it seems like I should be able to get it done with one operation.</p>  <p>Looking for opinions on if it's feasible.</p>
