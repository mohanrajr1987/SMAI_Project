<p>I don't know if there is such a thing - but I'm trying to do an ordered dict comprehension.  However it doesn't seem to work?</p>  <pre><code>import requests from bs4 import BeautifulSoup from collections import OrderedDict   soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser') tables = soup.find_all('table') t_data = OrderedDict() rows = tables[1].find_all('tr') t_data = {row.th.text: row.td.text for row in rows if row.td } </code></pre>  <p>It's left as a normal dict comprehension for now (I've also left out the usual requests to soup boilerplate). Any ideas?  Thanks.</p>
