<p>I'm making an easy scrapper to see if I can get the value in an input that I need from a HTML I made. It always shows <strong>None</strong> as an answer, so I'm checkin with something more simple, the &lt; title > in the html.</p>  <pre><code>from bs4 import BeautifulSoup # parsing r = open("C:/Python27/Pruebas/pruebahtml.html") print(r.read())  soup = BeautifulSoup(r,"html.parser") title = soup.title print(title) r.close() </code></pre>  <p>But I'm still getting <strong>None</strong> as an answer, I have also used findALL, find_all and find to do this but I get some errors. Do anyone knows where's my mistake?</p>
