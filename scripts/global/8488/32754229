<p>I am wondering how would I open another page in my list with BeautifulSoup?  I have followed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xQTJi2tqgk" rel="nofollow">this tutorial</a>, but it does not tell us how to open another page on the list. Also how would I open a "a href" that is nested inside of a class?</p>  <p>Here is my code:</p>  <pre><code># coding: utf-8  import requests from bs4 import BeautifulSoup  r = requests.get("") soup = BeautifulSoup(r.content) soup.find_all("a")  for link in soup.find_all("a"):     print link.get("href")      for link in soup.find_all("a"):         print link.text      for link in soup.find_all("a"):         print link.text, link.get("href")      g_data = soup.find_all("div", {"class":"listing__left-column"})      for item in g_data:         print item.contents      for item in g_data:         print item.contents[0].text         print link.get('href')      for item in g_data:         print item.contents[0] </code></pre>  <p>I am trying to collect the href's from the titles of each business, and then open them and scrape that data.</p>
