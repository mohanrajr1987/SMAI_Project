<p>After reading for years, this is my first SO question. Thanks in advance for the help!</p>  <p>I'm looking to scrape content from articles on the Forbes website. The this as an example page: <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/katevinton/2015/09/22/google-microsoft-qualcomm-and-baidu-announce-joint-investment-cloudflare/" rel="nofollow">http://www.forbes.com/sites/katevinton/2015/09/22/google-microsoft-qualcomm-and-baidu-announce-joint-investment-cloudflare/</a>. When an article is loaded directly, the page source becomes a mess of JavaScript that is hard to parse. However, when I click on the 'print' button, it appends a "/print/" to the URL and gives me a page I have no problem parsing with BeautifulSoup.</p>  <p>When I enter the url with "/print/" appended, it redirects to the non-"/print/" page. I only get to the actual "/print/" page when I click on the button. Thus, my question is: how can I simulate clicking that print button programmatically to get to the Beautiful Soup scrapable page? Poking around, people seem to recommend mechanize for simulating browser actions but I'm not sure what I'd be trying to do with it in this case. Or is there a better way to scrape this data entirely?</p>  <p>I appreciate any help you can offer!</p>
