<p>I am trying to extract the text of the following page and save it into a single cell of a CSV file. However, I keep getting linebreaks at places where I don't see any "special" characters (ie even where there are no "\n", "\t", etc in the text). The second line of the CSV file also has more than one non-empty cell, instead of just saving the text into a single cell. </p>  <p>Here is the code:</p>  <pre><code># -*- coding: utf-8 -*- #Python3.x import urllib from bs4 import BeautifulSoup import requests, urllib, csv, re, sys csvfile=open('test.csv', 'w', encoding='cp850', errors='replace') writer=csv.writer(csvfile)  list_url= ["http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1025315/0000950127-05-000239.txt"]  for url in list_url:  base_url_parts = urllib.parse.urlparse(url)  while True:     raw_html = urllib.request.urlopen(url).read()     soup = BeautifulSoup(raw_html)      #### scrape the page for the desired info      text_10k=[]     ten_k=soup.get_text()     ten_k=ten_k.strip().replace("\t", " ").replace("\r", " ").replace('\n', ' ')     text_10k.append(ten_k)      #Zip the data     output_data=zip([text_10k])  #Write the observations to the CSV file     writer=csv.writer(open('test_10k.csv','a',newline='', encoding='cp850', errors='replace'))     writer.writerows(output_data)     csvfile.flush() </code></pre>  <p>I am sure my error is simple, but it's been months since I've used Python... I could definitely use a refresher. Many thanks!</p>  <p>EDIT: The output is too long to copy in full, but here is an example: </p>  <p>Line 1, Cell 1: ['-----BEGIN PRIVACY-ENHANCED MESSAGE-----\nProc-Type ..... -8-", 'The change in working cap<br> Line 2, Cell 1: tal is primarily attributable to the loss for the\nyear<br> Line 2, Cell 2: and the reduction in cash due to payments made on long-term notes payable.\n\n</p>  <p>I would like everything to be in a single cell (Line 1, cell 1), no linebreak characters. So:<br> Line 1, Cell 1: ['-----BEGIN PRIVACY-ENHANCED MESSAGE-----\nProc-Type ..... -8-", 'The change in working captal is primarily attributable to the loss for the\nyearand the reduction in cash due to payments made on long-term notes payable.\n\n</p>  <p>*Notice that an "i" goes missing in the word "capital" when it gets split between Lines 1 and 2. Not sure what causes the line to break this way. </p>  <p>EDIT2: I made it work by saving as a .txt file (which works fine as long as I open the output in Notepad++ or something similar). I still don't know why it would not work as a CSV, though.</p>
