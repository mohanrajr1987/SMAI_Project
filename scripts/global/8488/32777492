<p>I'm working on a project where I require the all of the game ID #'s found in the current scores section of <a href="http://www.nhl.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nhl.com/</a> to download content/ parse stats for each game. I want to be able to get all current game ID's in one go, but for some reason, I'm unable to download the full HTML of the page, no matter how I try. I'm using <code>requests</code> and <code>beautifulsoup4</code>.</p>  <p>Here's my problem:</p>  <p>I've determined that the particular tags I'm interested in are <code>div</code>'s where the CSS class = 'scrblk'. So, I wrote a function to pass into <code>BeautifulSoup.find_all()</code> to give me, specifically, blocks with that CSS class. It looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>    def find_scrblk(css_class):         return css_class is not None and css_class == 'scrblk' </code></pre>  <p>so, when I actually went to the web page in Firefox and saved it, then loaded the saved file in <code>beautifulsoup4</code>, I did the following:</p>  <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;soup = bs(open('nhl.html')) &gt;&gt;&gt;soup.find_all(class_=find_scrblk) [&lt;div class="scrblk" id="hsb2015010029"&gt; &lt;div class="defaultState"....] </code></pre>  <p>and everything was all fine and dandy; I had all the info I needed. However, when I tried to download the page using any of several automated methods I know, this returned simply an empty list. Here's what I tried:</p>  <ul> <li>using <code>requests.get()</code> and saving the <code>.text</code> attribute in a file</li> <li>using the <code>iter_content()</code> and <code>iter_lines()</code> methods of the <code>request</code>  object to write to the file piece by piece</li> <li>using <code>wget</code> to download the page (through <code>subprocess.call()</code>)  and open the resultant file. For this option, I was sure to use the <code>--page-requisites</code> and <code>--convert-links</code> flags so I downloaded (or so I thought)  all the necessary data.</li> </ul>  <p>With all of the above, I was unable to parse out the data that I need from the HTML files; it's as if they weren't being completely downloaded or something, but I have no idea what that something is or how to fix it. What am I doing wrong or missing here? I'm using python 2.7.9 on Ubuntu 15.04.</p>  <p>All of the files can be downloaded here: </p>  <p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/k6vv8hcxbkwy32b/nhl_html_examples.zip?dl=0" rel="nofollow">https://www.dropbox.com/s/k6vv8hcxbkwy32b/nhl_html_examples.zip?dl=0</a></p>
