<p>I'm writing a simple python3 script to extract as many public repositories as i can from Sourceforge.net.  I ran into a weird issue with the url that I am curious as to why its happening:</p>  <p>Here is my code</p>  <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3  import time from requests import get from bs4 import BeautifulSoup  results = []  for i in range(1,100):     cur = 'http://sourceforge.net/directory/os%3Alinux/freshness%3Arecently-updated/?page=' + str(i)     #print(cur + '\n')     r = get(cur.format(i))     soup = BeautifulSoup(r.text,'html.parser')     results += soup.find_all('span',{'itemprop': 'name'})     for result in results:         print('Found Project: '.join(result.contents))     time.sleep(.5)     results = [] </code></pre>  <p>The issue arises when I remove the /os%3Alinux/ from the url in order to have a broader range of projects... when I do this, the output is the output for page 1 over and over again.  Does not extract the other pages it seems.  Does anyone know as to why this is happening?  Also I got the r = get(cur.format(i)) from somebody else and am curious as to what this is actually doing.</p>
