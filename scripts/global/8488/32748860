<p>I really don't understand how BeautifulSoup works. I'm trying this : </p>  <pre><code>from bs4 import BeautifulSoup  def strip_del(soup):     for d in soup.find_all('del'):         d.decompose()  def num_there(s):     return any(i.isdigit() for i in s)  def is_airfield(tr):     return not num_there(tr.td.span.text)  soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'lxml') strip_del(soup)  for tr in soup.table.tbody:     if is_airfield(tr):         print('yes')     else:         print('no') </code></pre>  <p>But when I run, I have an error which say me that I can't access to <em>td</em> from a <code>NaviagableString</code> in my <code>is_airfield</code> function.  </p>  <p>So my question is why this doesn't work and how work BeautifulSoup ?!</p>  <p>Thanks for your help!</p>
