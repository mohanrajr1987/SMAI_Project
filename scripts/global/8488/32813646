<p>I am using Selenium to navigate a webpage. To analyze the elements and data, I use BeautifulSoup because of the excellent options they give, including searching with regex.</p>  <p>So now I have an element located in BeautifulSoup. I want to select it in Selenium.</p>  <p>I figured I could somehow pass a XPath or CSS selector from the BeautifulSoup element to the Selenium element.</p>  <p>Is there a direct way of going from a BeautifulSoup element to Selenium element?</p>
