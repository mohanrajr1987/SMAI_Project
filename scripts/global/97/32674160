<p>I'm having a problem after migrating my code to swift 2 (I'm very new at Swift and programming for iOS in general, so it might be a stupid mistake)</p>  <p>Because of the error handling in Swift 2 I added a "do, try ,catch" clause for my data retrieval:</p>  <p>Before:</p>  <pre><code>jsonData: NSDictionary = NSJSONSerialization.JSONObjectWithData(urlData!,     options:NSJSONReadingOptions.MutableContainers) as? NSDictionary}  </code></pre>  <p>After:</p>  <pre><code>do{     try jsonData = NSJSONSerialization.JSONObjectWithData(urlData!,     options:NSJSONReadingOptions.MutableContainers) as? NSDictionary}   catch let errorParsing as NSError      {errorParsing.description}   let success:NSInteger = jsonData!.valueForKey("success") as! NSInteger </code></pre>  <p>But now every time I try to access the jsonData object (example in the last line of code) I get the error "Variable captured by a closure before being initialised"</p>  <p>Can anyone explain to me how I can fix this, I tried using 'init()' but that didn't work. </p>  <p>Thanks in advance for your help. </p>  <p>PS: I know some other people here already posted a question about the same error, but none of them contained information/fix I could use. </p>  <p>Kr,</p>
