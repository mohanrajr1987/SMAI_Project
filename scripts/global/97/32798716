<p>Is it possible to migrate a single and particular TCP connection inside a running process in one machine to another machine using CRIU tools in Linux?</p>  <p>What I want is to dump a particular TCP Connection information in a memory and transfer this information to a peer machine. Inside this machine, I will use the dumped information to recreate the the migrated TCP connection. Does anyone have an example or tutorial in c language?</p>  <p>I am aware about different solutions like SockMi which provides Kernel Module + User Space APIs to migrate a certain TCP Socket. However, I want to use CRIU tools since it is part of Linux Mainline.</p>
