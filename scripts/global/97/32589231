<p>I have a migration with many remove_column.</p>  <p>I start it, but there is an error :</p>  <blockquote>   <p>-- remove_column(:responses, :text_fr)<br>      -> 0.5544s<br>   -- remove_column(:responses, :text_en)<br>      -> 0.2906s<br>   -- remove_column(:topics, :text_fr)<br>   rake aborted!<br>   StandardError: An error has occurred, all later migrations canceled:<br>   Mysql2::Error: Can't DROP 'text_fr'; check that column/key exists</p> </blockquote>  <p>It's my fault because I don't give the good name of column.</p>  <p>But my problem is : <strong>there is no automatic rollback !</strong></p>  <p>I have fix the name of column in migration file, but now it's not working because <code>text_fr</code> don't exist in <code>responses</code> table...</p>  <p>I remember before, when an error occur, there was a rollback as if migration had not occurred...</p>  <p>So how enable auto-rollback of migrations? </p>  <p>I'm using mysql2 gem.</p>
