<p>I'd like to merge the datasources from a ColdFusion 8 server to an existing ColdFusion 9 server. As far as I know the xml formats of the neo-datasources.xml of both versions are the same.</p>  <p>I've tried to copy and paste the xml block within the ... block from the CF8 neo-datasources.xml into the ColdFusion 9 xml file. Before that I've stopped the CF service. But after restarting the service either the CF8 datasources are loaded or the CF9 ones. Mostly there are only the CF9 datasources remain and the CF8 xml nodes are getting stripped off.</p>  <p>Anyone can tell me a better way to extend the neo-datasources.xml with the datasources of the CF8 server?</p>  <p>There are more than a hundred and I do not want to set them up one by one. The server is a CF8 Pro/Standard.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
