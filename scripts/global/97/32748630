<p>I am trying to run Django migrations on a Postgres database with BDR.</p>  <p><code>python manage.py makemigrations</code> </p>  <p>works fine, but running </p>  <p><code>python manage.py migrate</code> </p>  <p>results in the following error:</p>  <p><code>ALTER TABLE … ALTER COLUMN TYPE … may only affect UNLOGGED or TEMPORARY tables when BDR is active; auth_permission is a regular table</code></p>  <p>The offending module is <code>django/django/contrib/auth/migrations/0002_alter_permission_name_max_length.py</code>.</p>  <p>I am not finding anything on how to UNLOGGED tables using Django, especially, since auth_permissions is a Django table (not created by me).  I am also not sure if UNLOGGED tables will replicate.</p>  <p>Does anyone have any advice?</p>
