<p>Recently we migrated a clients CS install to a new instance and have run into way too many issues. Among handfuls of un-reliabilities, tedious errors, hiccups, slow support replies, etc, there are no admin users listed, and there is no way to enable/disable add-ons. This happened seemingly out of nowhere on both the new install and the old install sitting behind a dev domain.</p>  <p>First of all, the way CS splits admins compared to users (which is hidden in store) is very strange. I found the users buried in store settings, but I'm not listed there nor in admins. Why would CS not display the admin users? I am still able to edit them by manually putting their ID within the edit url, but nothing listed in the GUI. Also, why would I <strong>all of the sudden</strong> not be able to enable/disable add-ons across both installs? There is a 3rd party theme the client bought and the add-on mess is causing the theme license mod not to work (resulting in white page for their store). We already contacted both CS support and their theme dev support to swap domain names. There are no errors in logs. The return from CS license servers has "ACTIVATED" in the xml.</p>  <p>Overall, I'm extremely disappointed in the overly complex, unreliable, and error prone CS migrate process and arbitrary remote theme licensing schema. A 20 minute job is now on day 3, slowed by lack of support agility. Any help is appreciated.</p>
