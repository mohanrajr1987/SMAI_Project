<p>I have not lot work experience with PrimeFaces. I have to migrate a java web PrimeFaces project from 3.4 to 5.2. Although I searched it all over the internet there was not proper solution for my situation. If you ever have any experience with this kind of problem or ever heard of that please let me know or send me link for that. Basically I want to the way of doing it. I already have idea about witch component should be changed. Is there anything to do except replacing the jar? I already tried to replace PrimeFaces 3.4 with PrimeFaces 5.2 jar. But it does not allow me to replace the jar. Do I have to to change the code too? Please i want the migration steps.</p>
