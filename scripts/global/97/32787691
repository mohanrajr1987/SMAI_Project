<p>I migrated a SQL Server database to Oracle 11 Express and have trouble to connect to the converted database in Oracle SQL Developer. I followed the instruction here: <a href="http://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/tutorials/obe/db/hol08/sqldev_migration/mssqlserver/migrate_microsoft_sqlserver_otn.htm" rel="nofollow">Oracle Migration</a> the only difference is I am using an on-line migration.</p>  <p>I have successfully converted the database, but what I am struggling with is I cannot connect to the converted database because there is no user migrated (or created). Please see image below. I wonder if anyone has the same problem before or can give me directions how to solve this. </p>  <p>much appreciated for any suggestions/helps. </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/DfDdu.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/DfDdu.png" alt="enter image description here"></a> </p>
