<p>I search for easiest way for migrating from custom CMS builded upon PostgreSQL to WordPress CMS.</p>  <p>I don't search for ready-quick answer, but some guidance, approach explanation etc.</p>  <p>Also, if someone here is sure that his approach is successful, then we can work together (with some money arrangement).</p>  <p>Thank you</p>
