<p>My team has had the Django migration files in .gitignore , and so hasn't been committing these files. Instead we've been making migrations on our production server. We discovered that this is not the recommended practice (upon encountering <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28035119/ignoring-migration-files-in-git-in-a-django-project">Ignoring migration files in git in a Django Project</a> ). Would it cause problems to - at this point in time - remove migrations from .gitignore, makemigrations on the development machine, commit, push, and apply the migrations on the production server? If so, how can we get around these problems? </p>  <p>This question is motivated largely because we need to apply a custom migration that we partially wrote ourselves. (As such there's actually an additional step between making migrations on the development machine and committing them, namely adding in our custom code to the migration file).</p>
