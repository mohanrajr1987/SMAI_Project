<p>Basically my main goal to move 200GB from a <em>MACSERVER</em> and make sure the integrity of the files to a <em>WINDOWS SERVER</em>. As far as I know you can't do that kind of job by just copy/paste. I have a couple suggestions for use this Software</p>  <p>NTFS for Mac by Paragon, also have another recommendation of using two step.</p>  <p>First copy all the files with Carbon Copy Cloner and them using Robocopy to move those files to WINDOWS but since I don't have user experience with that I don't know if that is a good way to precede</p>  <p>That is according to this source <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4503828" rel="nofollow">MAC FORUM DISCUSSION</a>  </p>  <p>I just need some of your advises as always, and also giving me new ways of doing this job because the MAC SEVER is about to die so I am running out of time. if you need more information please let me know. Thanks for any comments. Have a nice day.</p>
