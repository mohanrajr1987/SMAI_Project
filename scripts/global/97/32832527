<p>I need to move a Jenkins setup to a new machine. I understand from past questions, the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Administering+Jenkins" rel="nofollow">official answer</a> is that you can simply copy over the contents of the old JENKINS_HOME to the new from one install of Jenkins to another. However, that seems overly simplistic to me. When cloning an existing Jenkins setup, aren't there any file paths in the plugins that need to be duplicated? Aren't there ssh keys that need to be moved as well?</p>
