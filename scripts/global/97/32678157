<p>thanks for this commmunity, it has helped me alot already. This is the first question I have to post myself, and it is somewhat specific to my project.</p>  <p>I have started from MHartls great rails tutorial. There were models for Users and Microposts and I have added a Cars model, where each user can have a car (referenced by the car_id).</p>  <p>In the console I can create a user and a micropost, and assign the user to the micropost by stating post.user = michael and then it would set the post's user_id to michaels id. I am trying to do the same for cars, where i can set a users car_id by stating michael.car = somecar but it gives an error even though the model associations LOOK exactly the same, and I have even remigrated the car_id to the user model as reference. See below:</p>  <pre><code>class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base  has_many :microposts, dependent: :destroy  belongs_to :cars  class Micropost &lt; ActiveRecord::Base    belongs_to :user    belongs_to :car  class Car &lt; ActiveRecord::Base    has_many :microposts, dependent: :destroy    has_many :users    accepts_nested_attributes_for :users    accepts_nested_attributes_for :microposts </code></pre>  <p>Here is my last migration for the car_id:</p>  <pre><code>class Addreferencecartousers &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration  def change     add_reference :users, :car      add_foreign_key :users, :cars  end end </code></pre>  <p>in synch with what I had done for the user/micropost connection.</p>  <p>I am kind of lost on where else to look for why this does not work, does anyone have any hints/pointers on what I am missing here?</p>
