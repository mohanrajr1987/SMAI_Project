<p>I'm trying to create a migration that makes a new column and fills it with data from existing column.</p>  <p>I want to turn the name column into a slug (using the helper function) and save that in a slug column.</p>  <p>I've tried this but no luck:</p>  <pre><code>public function up() {     Schema::table('teams', function(Blueprint $table)     {         //         $table-&gt;string('slug', 100);     });      $teams = DB::table('teams')-&gt;get();      foreach ($teams as $team)     {         $team-&gt;slug = str_slug($team-&gt;name, "-");         $team-&gt;save();     } } </code></pre>  <p>Am i being an idiot? Can i make this work?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
