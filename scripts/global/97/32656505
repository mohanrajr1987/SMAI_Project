<p>Is there an easy way to identify all the API calls an Android app makes that need to be adapted to use runtime permissions in Android M (6, API 23)?</p>  <p>It appears that you just have to figure it out by testing, trial &amp; error, or expert knowledge (eg: pouring over the API docs and your source code).  I expected that Google would release a migration tool, but I haven't seen any evidence of that.  <em>Not</em> doing so looks as though it will leave your apps vulnerable to runtime crashes if anyone disables access to a permission post-install, even if you aren't using the runtime permission tags in your manifest.</p>  <p>What are the best practices for migrating to runtime permissions?</p>
