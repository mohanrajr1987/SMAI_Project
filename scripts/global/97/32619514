<p>my main doubt is that i have a spree shop that the client now wants all the product data (name, variants, descriptions, images) to be exported and ready to be imported to magento. </p>  <p>I tried using the gem datashift_spree and was able to get a csv with the main product information but wasn't able on adding there also the images filenames.</p>  <p>Am i missing some feature on the datashift gem to fetch the image names?</p>  <p>Does anyone know a good way of fetching all product information from spree? Especially also the image filenames of each product.  </p>  <p>Thanks for the attention.</p>
