<p>I am using JSF 1.2 , Richfaces 3.3.0 , Maven2 with Tomcat 6. I am in need to migrate from JSF 1.2 to JSF 2.0 in order to get rid of problems raised in my project. </p>  <p>I had found that Richfaces 3.3.3 is a stepping stone to JSF 2.0 . </p>  <p>I know there is more effort in migration to Richfaces 4.0, Facelets 2.0 and JSF 2.0 from my spec referred in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4441713/migrating-from-jsf-1-2-to-jsf-2-0">Painfullness in Migration</a></p>  <p>I referred <a href="https://developer.jboss.org/wiki/RichFaces333andJSF20" rel="nofollow">JSF 2.0 and Richfaces 3.3.3</a> and I need to upgrade only JSF.</p>  <p>My Question is</p>  <ol> <li>Can I upgrade JSF 1.2 to JSF 2.0 and Richfaces 3.3.0 to Richfaces 3.3.3 and use only Facelet 1.1.15 (currently using, in order to minimise the effort).</li> <li>Is there any major differenence between Richfaces 3.3.0 and 3.3.3.</li> </ol>  <p>Edit: Can I upgrade Richfaces from 3.3.0 to 3.3.3 without JSF upgradation.</p>  <p>Hope you can understand my query. Suggest me a solution to migrate. </p>
