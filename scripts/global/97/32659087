<p>There are instance-based functions and instance variables that I need to call from a custom Django migrations file. Can I do this, and if so, how?</p>  <p>For example I have an instance, c, of class Car. How do I call c.honk() from within a migrations file, or access c.colour ?</p>  <p>P.S. I know that I can 'import' models within the migrations file using ModelName = apps.get_model('appname', 'ModelName') , and I know that I can call class-based functions by doing <strong>import</strong>('appname').pythonfile.functionname .  In other words I know how to do things like call Car.get_components() from within a migrations file.</p>  <p>P.P.S. I'm not sure whether "instance-based functions" and "class-based functions" is the right terminology, but I hope you understand what I mean.</p>
