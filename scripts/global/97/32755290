<p>so I have successfully installed Bitnami on my Linux. Purchased a theme from themeforest created a couple of pages using visual composer and some other plugins, customized some theme options, created a child theme and added some custom css in it. All well and dandy.</p>  <p>Now I'm trying to transfer the whole thing on other computer with some demands if possible. For better understanding of what I'm after lets simplify some things. Lets call:</p>  <p>The original(no changes have been made) purchased theme zip ...... T1</p>  <p>Same but customized theme on my first computer ...... T2</p>  <p>Child theme on my first computer ...... C1</p>  <p>What I'm trying to do on second computer:</p>  <ol> <li>Installing a T1</li> <li>Installing a C1</li> <li>Importing all the changed files between T2 and T1</li> </ol>  <p>So far I've done steps 1 and 2 successfully but before proceeding with step 3 I need some help. Is it smart to use some program that compares two directories and finds the files that don't match or is there a better way of doing what I want? I would like to do the step 1 because every time when the theme is updated I can simply import a new T1 and then repeat the step 3. Please help. </p>
