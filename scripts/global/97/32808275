<p>I have an RDBM which needs to be converted to MySQL. I would like to open the database with Workbench and get a file to someone. However every time I run the migration wizard for a Microsoft Access RDBM, ODBC data source parameter, and then find the data source to migrate, it simply just blocks the process on the test, saying:</p>  <pre><code>"Test Source DBMS Connection: Operation Cancelled" </code></pre>  <p>The RDBM is either type .mdf, .accd or 5.3 ANSI. None allow a connection. I have searched Oracle and other sources online with very few hints or clues as to why this happens to my database. The only other alternative is buy some expensive conversion software. Please help! I have not a clue what information might be of use to me to solve this problem. I have used the standard Oracle/MySQL tutorial: <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/wb-migration-database-access.html" rel="nofollow">https://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/wb-migration-database-access.html</a></p>  <p>Also to note I have tried disabling all firewalls. And the general ODBC connections I make just quit working, saying in various ways they cannot connect. Any resources to point me to that might be helpful with some more basics on this?</p>  <p>I also found this resource which explains why certain pipe connections are not working for ODBC: <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/can-not-connect-to-server.html" rel="nofollow">http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/can-not-connect-to-server.html</a> It lists some command prompts which I am uncertain how to use or where to enter. I tried running these as admin on a standard cmd but they just say command not recognized.</p>
