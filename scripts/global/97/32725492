<h2>Scenario description:</h2>  <p>I have a master and a feature branch for my source control.</p>  <p>---- master<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\-- feature</p>  <p>I have a column called <code>useless_column</code> for my <code>User</code> model, which is present in master branch, which i want to drop in feature branch.</p>  <p>Now, I <strong>drop</strong> <code>useless_column</code> using rails migrations in <strong>feature branch</strong> removing all code that depends on that column and commit. <code>schema.rb</code> and psql database are now updated.</p>  <h2>Question:</h2>  <p>Next, suddenly, I realize I made a mistake, and I want to <strong>go back to the master branch</strong> and discontinue working on feature branch. So, I <code>git checkout -b master</code>, but at this point I cannot <code>db:rollback</code> or <code>schema:load</code> or anything because the database <strong>has forgotten all the values</strong> in the <code>useless_column</code> which the master branch still depends on.</p>  <p>Does this mean I had to make a dump before I removed this column? If so, then the workflow is to make a database dump everytime you do a migration? If not, then how do you solve this problem?</p>  <p>Related link: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4735058/how-to-work-with-git-branches-and-rails-migrations">How to work with Git branches and Rails migrations</a></p>  <p>Useful link: <a href="http://technotes.iangreenleaf.com/posts/2013-09-10-rails-migrations-and-schema.html" rel="nofollow">http://technotes.iangreenleaf.com/posts/2013-09-10-rails-migrations-and-schema.html</a></p>
