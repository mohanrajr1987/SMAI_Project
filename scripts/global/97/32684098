<p>Scenario: I had to redesign an entire database, requiring new tables, for a migration from one version of software to another. This is only 2-3GB worth of data.</p>  <p>I've created the migration script with many INSERT INTO... SELECT transactions.</p>  <p>It takes roughly 3-4 hours to migrate on a single-disk, whereas on a raid-5 setup, I fear it is going to take longer when I take it to production. </p>  <p>My question is, is there a quicker way to do this in MySQL, or am I just S.O.L and have to bite the bullet on this? I think it might take more than 1-2 days of production downtime, which is difficult to do in this situation.</p>
