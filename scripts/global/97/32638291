<p>I'm getting a crash on my App Store update, the migration is handled and even when I see the code Block is being executed I get the Following migration error</p>  <blockquote>   <p>'RLMException', reason: 'Migration is required for object type   'LLCachedObject' due to the following errors:   - Property 'resultType' has been added to latest object model.'</p> </blockquote>  <p>This is how I'm handling the Migration </p>  <pre><code>[migration enumerateObjects:LLCachedObject.className                       block:^(RLMObject *oldObject, RLMObject *newObject) {                           if (oldSchemaVersion &lt; 5) {                               newObject[@"resultType"] = kLLResultTypeBrief;                           }                       }]; </code></pre>  <p>and I double-checked that the oldSchemaVersion was 4, and newObject[@"resultType"] is being set properly, this is happening on iOS 9, I'm completely clueless as I've run out of things to checked to find out what is causing this.</p>
