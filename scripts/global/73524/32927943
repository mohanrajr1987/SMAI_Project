<p>I have an activity (let's name it, activity 1), which contains a list with several elements. This activity has a button that allows to add more elements to the list when is pushed. For example, the original state of the list displays 5 elements, each time the button is pushed, two more elements are added to the list (7, 9, 11...).</p>  <p>When a item of the list is pushed, a different activity (let's name it, activity 2) is loaded.</p>  <p>The problem is that if I use the phone's return button to come back to the activity 1, the list is displayed in its original state, namely, only five items.</p>  <p>Is it possible to recover the last status of the list before to go to activity 2? Namely, if the list had 9 elements because de button was pushed 2 times and then I went to the activity 2, is it possible to display the list with those 9 elements when the phone's return button is pushed? </p>  <p>Currently, the list is displayed with the five original elements.</p>
