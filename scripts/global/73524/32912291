<p>I have an <strong>Activity</strong> with following special properties set in manifest</p>  <pre><code>&lt;activity         android:name=".LightUp"         android:excludeFromRecents="true"         android:launchMode="singleInstance"         android:noHistory="true"         android:process=":listener"         android:taskAffinity="" &gt;     &lt;/activity&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Inside this activity, I'm scheduling an <strong>AlarmManager</strong> to use this <strong>PendingIntent</strong> to call itself after sometime. <strong>AlarmManager</strong> is necessary because phone will go to sleep while this activity is on screen, and I don't want to hold a wakelock.</p>  <pre><code>pendingIntent = PendingIntent.getActivity(this, 10,                 new Intent(this, LightUp.class)                 .setFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_REORDER_TO_FRONT),                 PendingIntent.FLAG_UPDATE_CURRENT); </code></pre>  <p>So when Alarm manager fires, I'm getting the new Intent in <strong>onNewIntent()</strong> function as usual. Which means intent is coming to same activity. Problem is the activity gets destroyed after <strong>onNewIntent</strong>. Even if I have absolutely no code in <strong>onNewIntent</strong>, I can see from logs that <strong>onDestroy</strong> is getting called anyway.</p>  <p>So question is why  is Destroy being called? What can I do to keep the activity running?</p>
