<p><strong>GOAL:</strong> put image in ImageView ,which is captured from camera;</p>  <p><strong>PROBLEM:</strong></p>  <p>pic file name is based on time, when switch back from camera, the filename changed.</p>  <p>I tried using intent putExtra, but it seems not the right way.</p>  <p><strong>CODES:</strong></p>  <pre><code>public class test{    private static folder=myfolder();     public static myfolder(){       .....       folder= "YY-MM-DD/HHMMSS.jpg";    }    takephoto.setOnClick....//use camera    .....     protected void onActivityResult(...       // how to get the pic name by easy way?       // it changed when switch back from camera! filename recreated based on time    }); } </code></pre>  <p><strong>new problem:</strong>  why I can't use photo.setImageBitmap() in onActivityResult to show the pic? only when I click the test button, the photo is shown!</p>
