<p>I have two screens in my app, screen "a" and "b". Screen "b" has a button, that is defined by layout file. I need to change the text of the button from code. I managed to do this by using <strong>button.setText()</strong>, but when i change screen to "a" and back to "b" the text is being changed back to initial( to text which is specified in layout fail). I need to avoid such behavior, which means i need the changed text after changing of screen. Thanks!</p>
