<p>When the user taps a key on a <strong><em>hardware</em></strong> keyboard in my app, it launches a search activity and populates the search field with the keystroke. The problem is, if the user types very quickly, some keystrokes will occur during the activity transition, and they are discarded with this warning:</p>  <pre><code>W/ViewRootImplï¹• Dropping event due to no window focus: KeyEvent { action=ACTION_DOWN, keyCode=KEYCODE_R, scanCode=19, metaState=0, flags=0x8, repeatCount=0, eventTime=12610647, downTime=12610647, deviceId=8, source=0x301 } </code></pre>  <p>Keyboard callbacks (e.g. <code>onKeyDown()</code>) are not called in the originating activity or the search activity.</p>  <p><strong>Is there any way to catch those keystrokes?</strong></p>  <p>Thanks in advance...</p>
