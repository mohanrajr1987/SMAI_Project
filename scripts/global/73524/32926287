<p>I will explain what I want to achieve by this image:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ykKtP.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ykKtP.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>When someone starts the app for the first time, setup activity will open and I want it to have multiple steps. I guess creating activity for each part of the setup is not the best solution. I would prefer if the activity would just transform to the part 2 without any animation or with a sliding animation and I want it to only change the setup part by pressing the buttons. What's the best / easiest way to achieve this? Thanks for any answers.</p>
