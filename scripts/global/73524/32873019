<p>I am developing an android app which generates an ongoing notification. i build the notification using NotificationComapt.Builder in onCreate() method of MainActivity and notifies in onResume() of MainActivity.</p>  <p>Please tell me in which function i should cancel my notification so that it remains there until my app is running.</p>  <p>PROBLEM : My app has 3 activities so when i leave MainActivity its onDestroy() is called so i cant use this function to cancel notification. I want my user to navigate through activities but notification to be cancelled when user closes the app.</p>  <p>I also want notification to remain there while my application is minimized.</p>  <p>THANKS IN ADVANCE</p>
