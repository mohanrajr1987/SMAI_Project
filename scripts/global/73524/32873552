<p>I've just downloaded a project (<a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Geig7.png" rel="nofollow">usb-serial-for-android</a>) from github and added it as a module to my existing project with default <code>com.mycompany.serialexample.MainActivity</code> main acitivity. </p>  <p>The module I just imported is actually comprised of two modules, <code>usbSerialExamples</code> and <code>usbSerialForAndroid</code>. See the android perspective of my project below:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Geig7.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Geig7.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>What I would like is to run the example activity on startup with its default activity as the main activity. How can I achieve this?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
