<p>In my app, my activity has a container with a fragment. When a button in that fragment is clicked, I add a new fragment to the container and add the previous fragment to the backstack.</p>  <pre><code>FragmentTransaction fragmentTransaction = getSupportFragmentManager().beginTransaction();     fragmentTransaction.add(R.id.primary_fragment_container, homeFragmentHandler);     fragmentTransaction.addToBackStack(folderId.toString());     fragmentTransaction.commit(); </code></pre>  <p>The result is that pressing back closes the top fragment and returns me to the previous fragment, which is exactly how I want it. HOWEVER there are certain elements on the fragment that should be refreshed at this point. When the user clicks back and is returned to the previous fragment, how do I know to refresh the data within that fragment? is there a method such as onResume() for this scenario?</p>
