<p>Good afternoon (Philippine Time). I just want to ask you how to remove the excess button? <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/jZ4aT.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/jZ4aT.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>As you can see guys, in Image Button there's excess part of button. How can I remove that? By the way I tried all scaleType and I found that centerCrop was better scale for this. </p>
