<p>I want to completely remove an Activity from the Task Stack, but finish() only seems to minimize the Task. If I click on the button on my phone that browses all the open Tasks, it's still there. I would need to swipe it away to get rid of it.</p>  <p>How do I actually get rid of an Activity completely? Currently I have Activity_A that launches Activity_B. When I press back, Activity_B minimizes and Activity_A is brought to the front. How do I make it simply get rid of Activity_B and return to Activity_A?</p>
