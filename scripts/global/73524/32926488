<p>I have a <code>RecyclerView</code> with 30 items totally, 10 items are visible on the screen. I want to use setScrollPosition() to scroll the <code>RecyclerView</code></p>  <p>But when I pass a value,  For Example: setScrollPosition(5), the <code>RecyclerView</code> is not getting scrolled by 5 items. But the scrolling initiates when I pass value 10 or above.</p>  <p>What is the reason for that delay?  Is that because the <code>RecyclerView</code> offset is at the lastvisibleposition?  How to solve this issue?</p>
