<p>I have to fix a bug: clicking (tapping on) the "back to the parent activity" arrow does not bring back to the parent activity in Android application. </p>  <p>The activity is defined in the manifest as </p>  <pre><code>    &lt;activity         android:name=".WorkHistory"         android:label="@string/title_activity_list"         android:parentActivityName=".Progress" &gt;         &lt;meta-data             android:name="android.support.PARENT_ACTIVITY"             android:value="com.au.ontime.Progress" /&gt;     &lt;/activity&gt; </code></pre>  <p>and launched from the <code>com.au.ontime.Progress</code> activity like</p>  <pre><code>        intent = new Intent(Progress.this, WorkHistory.class);         if (timeLine.onTheClock()) {             intent.putExtra("activeSince", timeLine.getLastClockin());             intent.putExtra("active", timeLine.getActive());         }         startActivity(intent); </code></pre>  <p>The activity does not have any code to call <code>finish()</code>. It was always closed by tapping on the arrow on the top left and this worked before. The activity otherwise starts and executes normally, without error messages in the logs. The back arrow is visible just not functional. There are other child activities in for this parent; these are defined in a similar way and works. </p>  <p>The device is Nexus 5, running Android 5.1.1. </p>
