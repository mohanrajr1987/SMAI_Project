<p>I am curious what the best practice would be for the following: 1. main activity is just gui with buttons 2. on button press it should start a new audio recorder session, record, and process 3. when finished processing it should return to the main activity with data</p>  <p>So, what would the best practice (architecture) be for doing this?  Should I use a fragment in the main activity, or call a second activity, or something else?</p>  <p>I would like it setup so I can call the recording session fragments/activity from several locations in the code and have it return the processed audio.</p>  <p>Thanks for the comments!  Any code examples would be amazing!  Thank you.</p>
