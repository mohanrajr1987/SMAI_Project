<p>I'm finding some instances, on some devices but far from all, where my app will crash when trying to open a <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/appwidgets/index.html#Configuring" rel="nofollow">configuration Activity</a> for my <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/appwidgets/index.html" rel="nofollow">App Widget</a>.  Crash reports include the following:</p>  <pre><code>java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to start activity ComponentInfo{com.x.y.z/com.x.y.A}: java.lang.SecurityException: Permission denial: writing to settings requires android.permission.WRITE_SETTINGS  Caused by: java.lang.SecurityException: Permission denial: writing to settings requires android.permission.WRITE_SETTINGS </code></pre>  <p>Of course, I've tried adding the following to my <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code>:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_SETTINGS"/&gt; </code></pre>  <p>But this does nothing to stop the crashes, with the same messages about requiring <code>android.permission.WRITE_SETTINGS</code>.</p>  <p>I'm at a loss... it's saying that this permission is needed, and I'm granting that permission, but still the crashes.  Furthermore, I'm not sure why this is only an issue with some devices (a minority) and not others.  Why is it required at all?  In my configuration Activity I write to and read from <a href="http://developer.android.com/training/basics/data-storage/shared-preferences.html" rel="nofollow">SharedPreferences</a> but this hasn't caused any permissions issues until recently.</p>  <p>These are the devices that have been sending in crash reports:</p>  <pre><code>Galaxy Note3 (hlte) running Android 5.0 Galaxy Note 10.1 (p4noterf) running Android 4.4 Galaxy Tab3 7.0 (lt02wifi) running Android 4.4 </code></pre>  <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> these users are now reporting that adding this permission <em>has</em> stopped the crashing (though I definitely received at least one crash report from the beta version that includes the new permission).  It still begs the question as to why this permission is required.  It seems to relate to modifying the system settings... that isn't really what I need to do, I only need to write to <code>SharedPreferences</code>, and some users may be concerned by this permission.  And why only needed for some devices but not others?</p>  <p>Is there a way I can limit granting this permission to only those devices that seem to need it?</p>
