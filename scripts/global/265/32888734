<p>I'm getting the following error when building my WPF app on my (TFS) build server:</p>  <pre><code>The name 'InitializeComponent' does not exist the current context. </code></pre>  <p>In Visual Studio 2013, everything builds fine. I can reproduce the error if I build it with msbuild at the command line.</p>  <p>The problem is with my build configuration. I don't get the error when I build for AnyCPU, but I need the x86, because that's the only way I can get an ActiveX control to work (I've tried a whole load of solutions for that, believe me).</p>  <p>When I create a new WPF project, I can build against x86 fine, so it must be something specific to this solution, but I can't figure out what.</p>  <p>Anyone had a similar experience?</p>  <p><strong>Update</strong></p>  <p>When I remove my WiX installer project from the solution, everything builds fine for x86. So WiX must have something to do with it...</p>
