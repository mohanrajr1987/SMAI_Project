<p>In a targets file, I have the following item group:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;ItemGroup&gt;   &lt;MyGroup Include="$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)..\dist\**\*.*"&gt;   &lt;/MyGroup&gt; &lt;/ItemGroup&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I want to match all files which have an extension (contain a dot in their name), but the pattern above is matching files that have no extension (e.g., README). What am I doing wrong?</p>
