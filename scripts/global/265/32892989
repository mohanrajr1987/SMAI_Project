<p>I am having problems with a build server that I am trying to set up. We use telerik, and have installed the libraries with the telerik control panel. The build process searches for the dll's all the wrong places.</p>  <p>Needless to say that the solutions builds perfectly on developer maschines.</p>  <p>The solution contains many projects, and not a single main project. I really do not want to have to change all the proj-files. </p>  <p>What I want is to add the telerik directory to AssemblySearchPaths, but using the msbuild parameters from the gui only got me to overwrite the AssemblySearchPath - with the result that the location of everything else but telerik files became unknown to build.</p>  <p>So I located a .targets file, which I read in the logfiles were utilized by build to set AssemblySearchPaths. And adding the telerik directory here did the trick (alas I still cannot get the build server to find the nuget dll's but that is another story).</p>  <p>However, I see that depending on selected CPU and perhaps other circumstances, the build uses another similar named .targets file from another location. Also, I find it less than optimal that such crutial customization is hidden away in a automatically installed file somewhere obscure.</p>  <p>So the question is: how to add more searchpaths to the ones already defined by the framework?</p>  <p>I am somewhat unfamiliar with ms build, but I did see an full fledged ms build file once which is why I knew it defines the build searh paths. However; alternatives which does not require that I change the projects in the solution will work for me.</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
