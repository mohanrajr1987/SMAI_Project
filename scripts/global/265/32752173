<p>I am trying to setup Jenkins to automate a build. We have one enormous repository with approximately 100 solution files. To build this repository we have a build program which finds all the solutions and builds in a specified order.</p>  <p>I would like to change that to use Jenkins. Is there a way to setup msbuild and specify a build order for all of these solution files? </p>  <p>p.s. I am trying to avoid creating one mammoth solution file which contains all of the projects.</p>
