<p>We use TFS-online but have a local build server which defaulted to two build agents when we set it up. Our app is set for continuous builds on check-in.</p>  <p>We found that when building packages the two agents had their own independent build number sequences, so that when agent1 ran it would save our package to NuGet as something like 1.2.3.37032 and then agent2 ran it would create a package 1.2.3.29321</p>  <p>Hence our deployment server was picking an older build when updating the application.</p>  <p>I realise we should also increment the version number e.g. 1.2.4 each time as well, but for every single check-in that's rather laborious.</p>  <p>For now we have had to disable one build agent to prevent this - is there a better way to do this, or a way to ensure the build numbers are sequential?</p>
