<p>I'm customizing the default template in TFS build to accommodate my solution. In the FindMatchingFiles workflow - MatchPattern property I'm trying to set Path.IO.Combine. My solution file is in a folder and the files I'm trying to match are one folder up in the Applications folder. The following pattern doesn't yeild results although there are files.</p>  <pre><code>IO.Path.Combine(Path.GetDirectoryName(localProject), "..\..\Applications\Windows Services\**\*.csproj") </code></pre>  <p>Can anyone help me with this? Thank you.</p>
