<p>I'm trying to use MSBuild to build a Visual Studio Solution, but I get the error: error MSB4019: The imported project "C:\Microsoft.Cpp.Default.props" was not found.</p>  <p>I've done a search and there is no file on the system with the name Microsoft.Cpp.Default.props.  Is there a way for me to build this solution without installing Visual Studio?  </p>  <p>Note the question at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16092169/why-does-msbuild-look-in-c-for-microsoft-cpp-default-props-instead-of-c-progr">Why does MSBuild look in C:\ for Microsoft.Cpp.Default.props instead of c:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild? ( error MSB4019)</a> is not a duplicate.  It answers the question of how to tell MSBuild where to look for Microsoft.Cpp.Default.props, but it does not address what to do if your system does not already have that file.  </p>
