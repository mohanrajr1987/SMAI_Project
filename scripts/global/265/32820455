<p>When trying to run Build / Rebuild in Visual Studio on a solution, nothing happens. </p>  <p>I can run the build from the command prompt using MSbuild.exe, and this gives me the output i would expect (Build succeeded) - But when trying to run it from visual studio, nothing happens. Theres no debug output or build output either. </p>  <p>The project is a MVC project, with some references to other projects. </p>  <p>I can create a new MVC project, and it runs just fine! </p>  <p>Any idea what might trigger this behavior?</p>  <p>Using Visual Studio 2015. </p>  <p>I Have tried the following: </p>  <ul> <li>Restarting VS</li> <li>Comparing the solution file to a new solution file</li> <li>Triggering build manually from MSBuild (OK)</li> <li>Switching Debug / Release configuration</li> <li>Building projects individually</li> <li>Updated NuGet</li> <li>Build Configuration is OK (Everything checked for Build)</li> </ul>  <p>That beeing said, the solution is inside a git repository, and the other person working on this project has entered at a later stage with Visual Studio 2013 - But i dont know if this has anything to do with the issue.</p>
