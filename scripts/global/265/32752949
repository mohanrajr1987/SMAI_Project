<p>Can anyone let me know how the build definition for a nodejs application should look like? Also how to mention the mocha tests in the Automated tests?</p>  <p>First time when i tied to queue q build, i got an error saying Microsoft.NodejsTools.targets not found. So i went and copied the NodejsTools folder with the .target and dll file in my build server. And i didnt see the error.</p>  <p>Now i get the below error: C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\Microsoft\VisualStudio\v11.0\WebApplications\Microsoft.WebApplication.targets (132): Could not copy the file "obj\Debug\OstNodeJs.exe" because it was not found.</p>
