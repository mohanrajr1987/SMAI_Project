<p>I have an XML file in ChildProject with <code>Build Action</code> set to <code>Content</code> and <code>Copy to Output Directory</code> set to <code>Copy Always</code>. When there are no changes and I then go in and edit the XML file, save, and then build the PrimaryProject (Console Application) the XML file that is built does not contain the change. A workaround is including the XML file as a link in the PrimaryProject but this does not seem expected behavior? It seems that a change to only a content item does not trigger a build of the ChildProject.</p>  <p>Note that in Configuration Manager all projects are checked to build and the normaly build process works as expected. Currently using VS 2013 Professional.</p>
