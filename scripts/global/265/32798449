<p>When I build my solution some project names include a part of the path, for example (below), Graphics is (I\Graphics) and Font is (I\Font).</p>  <p>Why does MSBuild need to add this to the project name and what does it mean?  I get the impression something isn't configured quite right with these projects although there seem to be no side effects in terms of the actual build or running.  I've looked through the project files and both projects are named correctly at the root node.</p>  <pre><code>12&gt;------ Rebuild All started: Project: Utility, Configuration: Debug x64 ------ 13&gt;------ Rebuild All started: Project: Time, Configuration: Debug x64 ------ 14&gt;------ Rebuild All started: Project: File, Configuration: Debug x64 ------ 15&gt;------ Rebuild All started: Project: Math, Configuration: Debug x64 ------ 16&gt;------ Rebuild All started: Project: Graphics (I\Graphics), Configuration: Debug x64 ------ 17&gt;------ Rebuild All started: Project: unit_exception, Configuration: Debug x64 ------ 18&gt;------ Rebuild All started: Project: unit_logging, Configuration: Debug x64 ------ 19&gt;------ Rebuild All started: Project: unit_memory, Configuration: Debug x64 ------ 20&gt;------ Rebuild All started: Project: unit_string, Configuration: Debug x64 ------ 21&gt;------ Rebuild All started: Project: unit_file, Configuration: Debug x64 ------ 22&gt;------ Rebuild All started: Project: unit_math, Configuration: Debug x64 ------ 23&gt;------ Rebuild All started: Project: unit_object, Configuration: Debug x64 ------ 24&gt;------ Rebuild All started: Project: unit_events, Configuration: Debug x64 ------ 25&gt;------ Rebuild All started: Project: Font (I\Font), Configuration: Debug x64 ------ 26&gt;------ Rebuild All started: Project: Window, Configuration: Debug x64 ------ 27&gt;------ Rebuild All started: Project: performance_math, Configuration: Debug x64 ------ 28&gt;------ Rebuild All started: Project: unit_time, Configuration: Debug x64 ------ </code></pre>
