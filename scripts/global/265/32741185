<p>I'm trying to find a way to bind my cloud service or webjob to GIT. <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/cloud-services-continuous-delivery-use-vso-git/" rel="nofollow">I've tried following this guide</a></p>  <p>Everything worked well - the files were uploaded and a build job was initiated on the server, <strong>BUT</strong> I keep getting the following error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>C:\a\src\AzureCloudService1\Crawler\Crawler.pyproj (48, 0) The   imported project "C:\Program Files   (x86)\MSBuild\Microsoft\VisualStudio\v12.0\Python   Tools\Microsoft.PythonTools.Worker.targets" was not found. Confirm   that the path in the  declaration is correct, and that the   file exists on disk.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I've searched this problem and based on suggestions I've found I uploaded the missing files and changed the location that points to them. The above missing files were then read successfully but they're trying to use other files as well, which can't be found for the same reason.  Shortly, I get a chain of "not found" files. I'm out of ideas, will appreciate your help.</p>
