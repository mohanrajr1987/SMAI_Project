<p>I have a question regarding FXCop analysis using SonarQube with the MSBuild-Runner. I have realized that the MSBuild-Runner loads a rules file from the server which matches the quality profile in Sonar and uses that file for the FXCop run.</p>  <p>In our project we have a solution with several projects. For each project a rules file is configured depending on its type e.g. product or test code. We also use custom rules in own FXCop assemblies. </p>  <p>How can I configure MSBuild-Runner so that he uses the rules file which is configured in the project file? How can I add our custom rules into Sonar? Can I import our rules files somehow?</p>  <p>Thanks for your help!</p>
