<p>I've got a solution in Visual Studio that contains a project for   - bower package  - npm package  - nuget package  - consumer</p>  <p>On build, all of these various packages are created and then the consumer uninstalls any previous version and reinstalls them all prior to building itself.</p>  <p>This is handy, but the builds are longer than I'd like.  I'd like to unload the projects for the bower package if I didn't want to work on that package at that time.  Same for Nuget and bower.  I <em>normally</em> only work on one at a time.</p>  <p>Because of this, <strong>I need to check (from the consumer csproj) if any of the other csproj's (npm, bower or nuget packages) built in the current build.</strong>  </p>  <p>Is there any way in MSBuild to accomplish this?  I tried declaring variables via <code>PropertyGroup</code>'s in the package projects and then checking them inside of the consumer, but the variables are wiped out when going to another project.</p>
