<p>I'm creating PowerShell script for building my Visual Studio Windows Store app. All steps are working except the last one, where I need to collect all PDB files related to all referenced sub-projects and dlls, including pdb files in NuGet packages folders.</p>  <p>Is there any tool that could do that for me? Ideally I'd just point it to target .csproj and it will collect all pdb files into single folder.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
