<p>I'm looking for advice on how to have team build 2013 use a pre-compiled common that is not checked in or part of the workspace.  Everything we build is QNX based and we are refactoring out a common set of components to be shared across all projects.  I've looked at Go and NuGet but that seems like a lot effort for something like this.<br> What is the best way to pull a prebuilt common into a TFS Team Build?</p>
