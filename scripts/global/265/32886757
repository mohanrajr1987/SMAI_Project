<p>How can I force Cmake to use Visual Studio 2010 for compiling my emscripten projects, and now VS 2015?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/jp4o9.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/jp4o9.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I keep running into an issue where cmake says it cannot find the build tools for MSBuild v140. I know it exists though, as the file path is </p>  <pre><code>C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\14.0\Bin </code></pre>  <p>I've even tried setting the path in the Emscripten Command Prompt with</p>  <pre><code>set PATH=C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\14.0\Bin;%PATH% </code></pre>  <p>but the issue still occurs. </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/SAge3.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/SAge3.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>If I open this solution in VS 2015, I can see that the configuration is set to Msbuild v 1.40, so I can't wrap my head around why Emscripten says it can't locate it.</p>  <p>The closest thing I could find is in <a href="https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/issues/3814" rel="nofollow">this GitHub bug report on Emscripten.</a> </p>  <p>Any suggestions?</p>
