<p>I have a C# project in which I have a COM Reference. It compiles fine when opened in VS 2013. But, it fails as part of TFS build definition.</p>  <p>TFS version : 2013 TFS Build Controller &amp; Agent : 2013 VS version : 2013</p>  <p>The failure message says that it could not find the Interop dll. I cannot manually create the Interop dll and check-in into TFS because it would keep changing and I want my C# project to always take the udpated COM reference.</p>  <p>I tried the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7498258/tfs-build-server-and-com-references-does-this-work">COMFileReference</a> suggestion but it did not solve my issue. I even manually registered the COM dll using regsvr32 but still I am facing the issue.</p>  <p>Any help is highly appreciated.</p>  <p>Regards, kvk1985</p>
