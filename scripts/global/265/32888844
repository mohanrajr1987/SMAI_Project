<p>I've been having a build error where some .exe are not found in the folder <code>$(OutputPath)\app.publish</code>.</p>  <p>The problem occurs during execution of GenerateManifest target and happens roughly 50% of the time I do a rebuild.</p>  <p>My scenario is the following: I have a solution with several projects, which 2 or more are published via clickonce. Projects are built in parallel.</p>
