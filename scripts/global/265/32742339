<p>We have all our projects setup to treat warnings as errors on release targets only.  I would like to set the /WX flag for all configurations so that I can catch the errors during debugging.  Is there a way to set that flag and have Visual Studio use it an pass it on to MSBuild?  I used to do similar with preprocess defines in C++ and launch VS with the /useenv flag, but I can't find anything similar.  It is out of my power to change the debug and other various targets to match the release targets.  Thanks.</p>
