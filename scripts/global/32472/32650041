<p>I'm in a project where we use NetTiers to generate the DAL. Whenever we make changes to de DBM we neet to (re)generate code. For DBOs that already exists we have a batch that copies the *.generated.cs files that NetTiers creates, effectivelly updating those files in our projects/solutions, but for new DB Tables if we use the same mechanism, those files will not be included in the project (we have to do this manually).</p>  <p>I would like to know if VS has some sort of command or if you know a way of how to include such files automatically and by a regex on the name.</p>  <p>If not, does anyone else have another solution that requires little effort?</p>
