<p>My <code>SSIS</code> package has an an <code>Execute SQL Task</code> object that runs at the very end of the package, where <code>SqlStatementSourceType = Variable</code>, and <code>SqlStatementSource = User::UpdateSql</code>.</p>  <p>I've set a breakpoint in <code>Break when the container receives the OnPreExecute event</code>; variable <code>User::UpdateSql</code> equals <code>UPDATE dbo.TableReportSummary set FileDate =   'C:\\FILES\\Files\\Ssis\\TextFiles\\THIS_IS_A_SIMPLE_TEST_090215.txt'</code></p>  <p>During package execution, everything runs correctly. But I check <code>[TableReportSummary]</code> and <code>FileDate</code> equals <code>null</code>.</p>  <p>My question is, why isn't it updating correctly? If an error had been encountered with the UPDATE (ie. connection problems, sql syntax, etc), the step would have failed.</p>  <p>I can copy/paste that exact UPDATE statement into a sql server editor, and the update is done correctly.</p>  <p>Any help is appreciated.</p>
