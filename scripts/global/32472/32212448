<p>Just finished merging two different branches of some code that were both already generating a ton of warnings. For the most part, it's stable, but there are some run time errors.</p>  <p>I was wondering if it's possible to get a <strong>complete</strong> list of only certain error types?</p>  <p>For example, all "Variable used before it's assigned a value. Null exception could result at runtime".</p>  <p>If I pull up the Error Window in VS I only get a handful of each instance of an error / warning per type of warning. Go through, fix them, re-build and it'll give me an updated list and show me some more instances of un-assigned values being used.</p>
