<p>I've just installed at fresh Sharepoint 2007 on a Server 2008 and installed the WSPbuilder(<a href="http://wspbuilder.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">http://wspbuilder.codeplex.com/</a>) v1.0.6 to use along with VS 2008. The wspbuilder plugin installed fine and is showing in VS and all functions is working except the "Copy to 12 hive". When i click "copy to 12 hive" in the context menu nothing happens. no error or anything. The server 2008 is 64 bit Any suggestions on how to fix that? </p>  <p>/Birger</p>
