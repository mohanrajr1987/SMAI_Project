<p>I have an executable C++ project (VS2008) which calls dll (VS2008). And that DLL also calls DLL (VS2012) which uses OpenCV. On the computer where Visual Studio is it works fine. But I have "LoadLibrary failed. Error 127" while trying to execute the same pack of files on another computer. </p>  <p>I've already checked the files with Dependency Walker and added all the DLLs missing.</p>
