<p>I'm trying to run an OpenCV 2.3.1 application through Microsoft Visual C++ 2008. I have generated the release exe file correctly, and it works fine on my windows 8 - 64 bits. In addition I would like to run it on Win XP, so I have tested it on a Win XP SP3 and it ran ok. However, when I try to run this exe on Win XP SP2, which is the target O.S. for my app, I get the following message:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>unable to start correctly (0xc000001d). Click Accept to finish the   application</p> </blockquote>  <p>Any idea please?</p>
