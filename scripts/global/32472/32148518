<p>I am porting an Win CE 6.0 app to a new hardware.</p>  <p>The app doesn't start on both WIN CE 6.0 and WEC 7 on the new hardware.</p>  <p>But if you first re-install the NETCFv35.wce.armv4.cab over the existing installation (force installation) then run the app, it starts both on WIN CE 6.0 and WEC 7</p>  <p>Every time after a reboot the NETCFv35.wce.armv4.cab needs to be re-installed to start the app.</p>  <p>I can also debug the app from VSTD 2008 which actually gave me the clue to deploy the NETCFv35.wce.armv4.cab at the very beginning.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance for your cooperation.</p>
