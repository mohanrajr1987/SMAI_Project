<p>I have Win7 64bit. In my project, I'm using Win API functions from <em>user32.dll</em> for DDE communication. In MS VS2008, everything worked without problems, but now I'm trying to upgrade project to MS VS2012 (on the same PC and OS) and API function call leads to program crash.</p>  <p>It is specifically this function:</p>  <pre><code>[DllImport("user32.dll", EntryPoint = "DdeAccessData", CharSet = CharSet.Ansi)]     internal static extern string DdeAccessDataString(IntPtr p, out int datasize); </code></pre>  <p>And it's call:</p>  <pre><code>string result = Dde.DdeAccessDataString(da, out datasize); </code></pre>  <p>I'm trying to debug it someway, but without success. I'm only able to to get message, that "<em>Windows has triggered a breakpoint</em>" on this line.</p>  <p>Can you suggest any approach how make it working?</p>
