<p>I have a report on RS and another Report on CR. The Queries are the same, both need parameters so that the report can show the information.</p>  <p>When I run the Query on MSSQL Server There is no difference in the data but when I try to run my report (RS) On Visual Studio 2008 the data is different.</p>  <p>For example: Order by: Street  On the database I have 2 rows with empty streets so those will be the 1st one to show, but RS is showing me one and CR is showing me both of them.</p>  <p>I can't put the whole query as it is Huge so if you need more information I'll try to do my best and put it here.</p>
