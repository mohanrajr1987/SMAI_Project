<p>I have Intel visual Fortran 11.0 and Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 installed on my system. I used them for a year to compile my user-defined subroutines dll to run them with Adina software (a finite element software). I used to compile my code in widows command console using the makefile that Adina provides. Recently, I installed visual studio 2015 to work on some C# codes. In order to be able to compile the C# codes in windows command console, I edited the path system variable to C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319. However, I noticed that I am not able to compile Adina anymore. The error message after running Adina makefile was:</p>  <p>*</p>  <pre><code>Microsoft (R) Program Maintenance Utility Version 9.00.21022.08 Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation.

WindowsSdkDir not found</em></p>  <p>I added the variable “WindowsSdkDir” with the value of “C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1A”, but it did not work.</p>  <p>Also, I uninstalled and reinstalled both Intel compiler and visual studio but it did not solve the problem. I will appreciate if someone can give me a hint to fix the problem.</p>  <p>Thanks,</p>  <p>P.S.</p>  <p>I can compile and build FORTRAN codes using visual studio 2008 but not using the windows command console and Adina makefile. </p>
