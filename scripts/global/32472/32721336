<p>I create a new class library with VS2013 .net 4.5 . The project run perfectly and I built it as a DLL so I can use it on my old project which develop by VS2008 .net 3.5.</p>  <p>after I reference into my old project(vs2008) , the reference seems to be not working , a small yellow exclamation mark appear beside the reference , and I found out the runtime version is empty. I was wondering is it cause by the .net framework , because VS2008 does not support after 3.5.</p>  <p>My question is it really the framework not supported in vs2008 , or is that anyway to reference .net 4.0 library in VS2008</p>
