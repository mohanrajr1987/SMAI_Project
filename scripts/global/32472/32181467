<p>I am using Visual Studio 2008 to create Setup Project. I want my project to extract files from msm-file that I have into specific subfolder which is located inside of my Application Folder.</p>  <ol> <li>I added msm-file (Merge Module) to my project.  </li> <li>I changed Module Retargetable Folder property.</li> </ol>  <p>When I start resulted msi-file I get following error:</p>  <p><strong>A portion of the folder path '' is invalid. It is either empty or exceeds the length allowed by the system.</strong></p>  <p>Interesting additional fact is that error occues only when I change default folder (Select Installation Folder step).</p>  <p>Could you please help me with this?</p>
