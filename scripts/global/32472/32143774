<p>I am using Visual Studio 2008</p>  <p>I have two applications (AppA and AppB) that I what to be installed using one msi-installer. Both applications have reference AppC.</p>  <p>This is what I did:</p>  <ol> <li>I created Setup Project</li> <li>I created two subfolders inside of Application Folder (AppA and AppB)</li> <li>I added Project Output for AppA into related subfolder</li> <li>I added Project Output for AppB into related subfolder</li> </ol>  <p>Problem: AppC did not appear in subfolder for AppB. It looks like dependency can only appear once.</p>  <p>Could please tell me how to resolve this?</p>
