<pre><code>SELECT * FROM [MarkTSK]  WHERE [MonthlyDt] IS NOT NULL --AND --SELECT DATEADD(mm, DATEDIFF(mm,0,getdate()), 0) </code></pre>  <p>Hello folks. Does anyone know how to correctly write this statement to  display the FIRST of each month? I have an Excel file that I am importing into a Server  using MS SSIS (VisualStudio 2008). The dates are monthly, but the last few months were the 15th June, May, April etc. My intent is to make  all of them show 1st of the month. All the months before January 2015 have been on the 1st of the month.</p>  <p>The SQL Query above is what I wrote in the Excel source Editor.</p>  <p>Thank You</p>
