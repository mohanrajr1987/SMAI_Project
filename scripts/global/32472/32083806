<p>I have TFS 2015 installed, and I'm trying to connect Visual Studio 2008 (Version 9.0.30729.4462 QFE) to the team project.  I have installed VS 2008 Team Explorer (version 9.0.21022.8).</p>  <p><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/Library/vs/alm/TFS/administer/requirements" rel="nofollow">According to MS</a>, this should be possible using MSSCCI Provider.  However, I can't find the version that's compatible with TFS 2015.</p>  <p><strong>Question:  Where is the MSSCCI Provider for TFS 2015, or is there another way to connect VS 2008 to TFS 2015 ?</strong></p>  <p>I have tried MSSCCI Provider for TFS 2013, and it failed because it didn't detect TFS 2013 (which makes sense since I have 2015 installed).</p>
