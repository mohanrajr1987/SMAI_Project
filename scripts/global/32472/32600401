<p>I have written code to display the data in table.. but they are coming together when I display and it looks like mess. The newline character '\n' is not working here.. It will give only one space gap.. I am using visual studio 2008 for coding and using c# for programming. Please have a look at my page and tell what new line character I need to use.</p>  <pre><code>foreach (DataRow row in dataTablesell.Rows)             {                 Response.Write(row["scriptname"].ToString());                  Response.Write(row["accnum"].ToString());                 Response.Write(row["Quantity"].ToString());                 Response.Write(row["price"].ToString());                 Response.Write("\n");              } </code></pre>  <p>The Output of this will come as ----> script4201025 script4151050 But I need every row to come in new line In the first line "scrpt4 20 10 25" and in second line "script4 15 10 50"</p>
