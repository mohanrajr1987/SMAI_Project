<p>If you use the Magnifying Glass icon while debugging to pull up the grid view for a <code>DataSet</code>, is it possible to copy all the data <strong>including</strong> the column names to the Clipboard? I'd like to just quickly copy-paste 2 objects into Excel for manual comparison, as they don't have 100% identical structure, but I can only seem to copy the rows themselves.</p>
