<p>While migrating from VS2008 to VS2013 i experience some difficulties. I copy the old include/library options from "Tools/Options" dialog under "Projects and Solutions/VC++ Directories" into a property sheet that i'm going to use over all projects i migrate.</p>  <p>I'm keeping the exact same sequence of include paths but VS2013 will complain about some includes. I can however do a right-click on the include to open the correct file and the correct file is also listed under "External Dependencies". But the compiler will complain about not finding the included file.</p>  <p>When i move the same path, from the common include folders and set it as additional include directory of the single project. It works</p>  <p>It's kind of strange because it seems that some paths i added do work correctly, and other won't.</p>
