<p>Is it correct to compare bool to 1?</p>  <p>In a legacy code I find often:</p>  <pre><code>if (xyz.isCounterActive() == 1) </code></pre>  <p>where sCounterActive() returns bool.</p>  <p>Obviously, <code>if ( xyz.isCounterActive() )</code> is sufficient, but If I change this, I don't know which side-effects it may cause. Software is big, buggy but the customer insists, that it is working.</p>  <p>Compiler is VS2008</p>
