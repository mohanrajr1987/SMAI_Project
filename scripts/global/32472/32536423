<p>I had debugged the code in release mode and then i got the exe from release folder in windows xp and the exe is working and the same process I did it on Windows 7 but it is not working. Can anyone suggest what are the changes that I have to do? Whether I have to do some modifications in the code or change the settings of Visual Studio. I am getting the error while connecting to the database at connection string</p>
