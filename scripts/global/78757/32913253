<p>Say suppose I have a people's template (people.hbs), and I want to list all the people that is retrieved from a GET to <a href="http://backendserver/api/people" rel="nofollow">http://backendserver/api/people</a>. However in future I decided to implement something that requires me to sort these people based on the data that I get from <a href="http://backendserver/api/vehicle_people" rel="nofollow">http://backendserver/api/vehicle_people</a>. In this data there is only the people id and the vehicle id so I can't just connect people and its associated vehicle information together , I also get vehicle data from <a href="http://backendserver/api/vehicles" rel="nofollow">http://backendserver/api/vehicles</a>.</p>  <p>Some of the confusion on how to implement this in Ember2 is</p>  <ol> <li><p>Should I put all this info inside routers/people.js something like this </p>  <pre><code>export default Ember.Route.extend({   model(){        return Ember.RSVP.hash({            people_with_vehicle: //find from this.store all the people and the vehicle ,            people_with_no_vehicle:,            all people:         })   } </code></pre></li> <li><p>How should I load the data for <a href="http://backendserver/api/vehicle_people" rel="nofollow">http://backendserver/api/vehicle_people</a> if I don't want to create any specific route or template ?. In ember2 it does like an automatic load based on the route you go to e.g if you defined in your /adapters/application.js</p>  <pre><code>export default DS.RESTAdapter.extend({    namespace: 'api',      host:'http://backendserver/'  }); </code></pre></li> </ol>
