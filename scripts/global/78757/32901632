<p>I'm using the Ember Data to catch JSON objects in my API route, and I want to be able to use a generic name in the result, not the name of the model.</p>  <p>For example, I have this JSON:</p>  <pre><code>{   event: [{     _id: "55f660bdd80a0fd2e298f333",     attributes: {       description: "test",       name: "name",       is_active: false     },     type: "event"   }, {     _id: "560e1d0de4b0b27b28d5dd1b",     attributes: {       description: "test",       name: "name",       is_active: false     },     type: "event"   }] } </code></pre>  <p>And is working, but I want to change the name from "event" to "data", but this will cause an error:</p>  <pre><code>WARNING: Encountered "data" in payload, but no model was found for model name "datum" (resolved model name using SiteApp.ApplicationSerializer.modelNameFromPayloadKey("data")) </code></pre>  <p>I understand why the error, but I actually need use DATA, is possible?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
