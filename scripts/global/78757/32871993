<p>I'm using the standard ActiveModelAdapter in my Ember app to do most of my queries to work with Ember model object.</p>  <p>In one case, however, I want to make a arbitrary REST request to get back JSON to populate a chart (not backed by a model) but I want to go "through" the ActiveModelAdapter so the correct host values are used.</p>  <p>Here's what's not working:</p>  <pre><code>updateChartFromIndustry: function() {   Ember.$.ajax({     context: this,     method: 'get',     url: 'api/v3/charts/all_risk.json',     dataType: 'json',     data: { ind: this.get('ind') }   }).then(function(json) {       Ember.$('#risk-days-data').highcharts(json);     },     function(errs) {       console.log(errs);     }   ); }.observes('ind'), </code></pre>  <p>In development, that query goes to localhost:4200 (the ember server) rather than the rails backend at localhost:3000.  Explicitely setting the full URL makes the query go through but without the various user session informatino that authenticates the request. </p>  <p>I'm really hoping for something simple like:</p>  <pre><code>this.store.query('arbitrary url and params', ....) </code></pre>  <p>as if I were making a normal query for a model or, alternately, to leverage the adapter:</p>  <pre><code>Ember.adapter.$.ajax(....)  </code></pre>
