<p>I'm familiar with the old ember-data "sideloading" model, which would look like this: ```</p>  <pre><code>{   authors:[     {id:1, name:"Ernest", type: 'author', books: [1,2]   ],   books: [     {id:1, name: "For whom the bell tolls", type: 'book', author:1},     {id:2, name: "Farewell To Arms", type: 'book', author:1}   ] } </code></pre>  <p>But the new JSON-API method is different.</p>  <p>For one thing, (and I like this), attributes are separated from the id and type information, preventing namespace collisions.</p>  <p>I don't yet understand how to do a <code>hasMany</code> relationship with the JSON-API format.  Can anyone point me to a doc or article on how this is expected?  The <a href="http://jsonapi.org/examples/" rel="nofollow">examples on the JSON-API page</a> show individual relationships, but not <code>hasMany</code>.</p>  <p>If you could write the above example in the new format, you'd have answered my question.</p>
