<p>I got a question concerning the .save() method in Ember-Data.</p>  <p>Normally, as I read in the docs, you should use it that way :</p>  <pre><code>this.set('model.title', newTitle); this.get('model').save(); </code></pre>  <p>The problem is : what if I have bind properties in my template and I want to wait for the successful save before refreshing the templates?</p>  <p>The first line of code automatically refreshes the templates with the bind properties, and I want to wait for the successful changes from my server.</p>
