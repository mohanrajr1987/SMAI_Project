<p>The example code below is how the model hook is supposed to work by default.  Strangely, if I don't include the model hook at all, the model is populated correctly.  If I include the model hook as below, it doesn't work because "params" is an empty object.  However, this.paramsFor('somemodel') returns {somemodel_id: "1"}  So, what am I missing here?</p>  <pre><code>import Ember from 'ember';  export default Ember.Route.extend({   model: function(params) {         return this.store.find('somemodel', params.somemodel_id);   } }); </code></pre>
