<p>currently i'm trying to catch all my events in my database by the 'events' route, and is working, but i have some doubts about how it works.</p>  <p><strong>Please, observe all the names.</strong></p>  <p>So,  i have this route, which will call the events route:</p>  <pre><code>SiteApp.EventsRoute = Ember.Route.extend({   model: function(params) {     this.store.findAll('event');  } }); </code></pre>  <p>Here, i'm using the EventSSSSSS, with S.</p>  <p>But my model needs to be without the S:</p>  <pre><code>SiteApp.Event = DS.Model.extend(   description : DS.attr()   name        : DS.attr()   type        : DS.attr() ) </code></pre>  <p>If i try to use with S and call <code>this.store.findAll('events');</code> will throw this strange error:</p>  <pre><code>Error while processing route: events Assertion Failed: You must include an 'id' for undefined in an object passed to 'push' Error: Assertion Failed: You must include an 'id' for undefined in an object passed to 'push' </code></pre>  <p>Why can't i use EventS in all? The framework is so amazing, but the documentation is very poor, and i'm not finding resources to understand the conventions...</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
