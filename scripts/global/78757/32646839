<p>I am using ember-data 2.0. I want to load all data from the server at startup. Then the app is really fast after the initial loading. The application is mobile, and may have varying bandwidth. I want to load the data as fast as possible.  I want to use JSON API to comply with the newest ways of using ember-data.</p>  <p>Each object is small, just a handful of attributes. But there may be 200 such objects to load.</p>  <p>Is it best to do many small ajax calls or one big one? I imagine it is faster to use one big call that contains all my objects, but is that possible with the JSON API and the out-of-the-box adapters?</p>  <p>Of course, I could just use findAll() but that will only load all objects of one type. I have several object types in my model that are connected with hasMany and belongsTo relationships. If I use the RestAdapter out of the box, that will result in many ajax calls, right?</p>  <p>What is the best strategy to use and how to implement that with ember-data and the adapters?</p>
