<p>In emberjs, considering the following data  (only showing 1 record, normally there would be multiple records):</p>  <pre><code>{ "service": [{     "service-_id":"service_5606ece79bdb05546479739866",     "service-_rev":"5-62dc477c13ef3ea92869bcdf1a67f1a6",     "service-company-name":"ABC co.",     "service-address":"1 2 3 Main Street",     "service-address-line-2":"",     "service-city":"asfd",     "service-state-current":"NY",     "service-zip":"12345",     "service-phone":"111",     "service-fax":"",     "service-email":"asdf@adsf.com",     "service-category-current":"web",     "service-type":"service",     "id":"service_5606ece79bdb05546479739866" }]} </code></pre>  <p>If I want to return all the records, I can simply do this:</p>  <pre><code>App.ServicesRoute = Ember.Route.extend({     model: function(){         return this.store.find('service');     } }); </code></pre>  <p>However, let's say I want to return all the records that have the current category as 'web'.  So in the example data, there is this key: <strong>service-category-current</strong></p>  <p>How would I adjust my model to find <strong>'service'</strong> then filter where <strong>service-category-current</strong> = <strong>'web'</strong>  ?</p>
