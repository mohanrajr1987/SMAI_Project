<p>i would like to know how the properties of a JSON should be liked when dealing with the ember-data library.</p>  <p>I was searching about it and i found that should be like this:</p>  <p>I want get all my BOOKINGS, for example, so should be like this:</p>  <pre><code>{   "data": [    {     "id": "209039090239390",     "type": "booking",     "attributes": {       "name": "Booking one"     }    },    {     "id": "209039090239390",     "type": "booking",     "attributes": {       "name": "Booking two"     }    }   ] } </code></pre>  <p>So, in this case, i have two bookings, and each one have the name attribute. Perfect until now? Let's continue.</p>  <p>Now, in my Ember Model, <strong>HOW</strong> should i define this?? <strong>(That's what i want know)</strong></p>  <p>Like this:</p>  <pre><code>App.BookingModel = DS.Model.extend({  type: DS.attr('string'),  attributes: {    name: DS.attr('string')  } }); </code></pre>  <p>Or like this:</p>  <pre><code>App.BookingModel = DS.Model.extend({  type: DS.attr('string'),  name: DS.attr('string') }); </code></pre>  <p>I'm using the first option, but i can't access the attributes object, because will throw an error:</p>  <pre><code>Error while processing route: bookings Cannot read property '_attributes' of undefined </code></pre>  <p>I already try to define as the second option, but than the result will be undefined, cause in my JSON, the NAME is inside attribute. I could change it and take off the attribute, but i want follow the convention..</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
