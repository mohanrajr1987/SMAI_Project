<p>I have Lambda Expression that returns data properly filtered, but I need to do some calculations on the records returned.</p>  <p>I have two entities (User and Language) that have a many-to-many relationship and I need to make a grouped count of the returnees languages so that to find out how many people speak each returned language.</p>  <p>Sample set of data returned by the Lambda Expression:</p>  <ul> <li>User1 (English, Spanish)</li> <li>User2 (English, French) </li> <li>User3 (English, Spanish)</li> </ul>  <p>Desired Result:</p>  <ul> <li>English       3</li> <li>Spanish       2</li> <li>French        1</li> </ul>  <p>I tried to use the GroupBy () and select (), but only got the right result with a foreach over the results, but would like to do this using Lambda.</p>
