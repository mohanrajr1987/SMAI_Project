<p>I just wrote a pretty big capture:</p>  <pre><code>[this, &amp;newIndex, &amp;indexedDirs, &amp;filters, &amp;flags, &amp;indexRecursion](){... </code></pre>  <p>I use this lambda (indexRecursion) for a recursion with thoudands of elements and asked myself, if it would be more efficient to use the "global" capture <code>[&amp;]</code>. Since I have no clue of the implementation of the capture I need some explanation. Please with background too.</p>
