<p>I need to use multiple conditions in a lambda expression to extract data from a Graphlab Sframe. The problem is that when I use a single condition the result is correct but if I use multiple conditions it gives erroneous result ignoring conditions altogether.</p>  <p>For instance here: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ltcuhx2k8jmzsno/Screenshot%20from%202015-10-03%2013%3A33%3A20.png/" rel="nofollow" title="Screenshot 1">Screen shot 1</a></p>  <p>But if I use single conditions it gives the correct result. For instance this: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/21y8u9e7cn1nv31/Screenshot%20from%202015-10-03%2014%3A15%3A35.png/" rel="nofollow" title="Screenshot 2">Screen shot 2</a></p>  <p>Can someone explain what's going on and how I can use multiple conditions?</p>  <p>Note: Since I don't have enough reputation I have used dropbox for embedding pictures.</p>
