<p>I am a newbie to AWS Lambda services. I will explain my requirements. Need to build a gstreamer-janus architecture for a monitoring application. 1. gstreamer will run in local system ( client side) and push the video to the janus gateway running in aws lambda services. 2. janus gateway will run on the AWS Lambda services.</p>  <p>I have a couple of doubts,</p>  <p>(1) Janus is not a built in library like imageMagick in AWS Lambda. It is a service, so how to run janus as an executable services in AWS Lambda. (2) How to push the video that is coming from gstreamer running in client side to the janus ? (3) How to make connection from gstreamer as an event that AWS Lambda can trigger ?</p>  <p>regards,</p>  <p>Ajith T S</p>
