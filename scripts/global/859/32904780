<p>Maybe I'm seriously missing something, but I'm unable to get rid of a syntax problem with all my classes.</p>  <p>Here is an example :</p>  <pre><code>class Foo {    bar: (x: string, y: number) =&gt; string = (xx: string, yy: number) : string =&gt; {       // do some stuff...    }; } </code></pre>  <p>Since I'm enforcing type declarations using tslint, ALL my methods are written like this. It's horrible. Having to copy paste the arguments part, renaming the args names between the type declaration and the lambda declaration is soooo painfull.</p>  <p>So : is there a better way to combine type signature and lambda declaration without all the knee jerking ? I sincerely hope I have missed something and hope this is not "by design" ! :)</p>
