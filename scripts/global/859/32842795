<p>Given the following class</p>  <pre><code>public class Person {     public string Name { get; }     public List&lt;Person&gt; Friends { get; } } </code></pre>  <p>I am looking for a way to get the following string "Friends.Name", when using an Expression>. </p>  <p>Here is the pseudo-code of what I want to do : </p>  <pre><code>Expression&lt;Func&lt;Person,string&gt;&gt; exp = x =&gt; x.Friends.Name </code></pre>  <p>Which won't compile for obvious reasons. </p>  <p>How can I achieve that ? Even if you don't have the code, a general approach would do the trick as I am lacking inspiration on this one.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
