<p>I have two tables, <code>UserNotifications</code> and <code>GlobalNotifications</code>.  I need to <code>Union</code> these two tables together and date order them to retrieve a users notification history.  This is the working query I currently have:</p>  <pre><code>var q = db.UserNotifications.Where(c =&gt; c.UserID == forUser.ScirraUserID)     .Select(c =&gt; new {c.ID, type = "u", date = c.FirstDate})     .Union(db.GlobalNotifications.Select(c =&gt; new {c.ID, type = "g", date = c.Date}))     .OrderBy(c =&gt; c.date)     .Skip(skip)     .Take(take); </code></pre>  <p>Problem is, I can't work out of it's possible to return the <code>UserNotifications</code> and <code>GlobalNotifications</code> records in the results as supposed to just their type and ID, which will require another query to the database to retrieve.</p>
