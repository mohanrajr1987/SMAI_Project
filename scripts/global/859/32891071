<p>I've been studying the lambda calculus and recently saw the Church-Rosser theorem. The theorem states that when applying reduction rules to terms in the lambda calculus, the ordering in which the reductions are chosen does not make a difference to the eventual result (from wiki). But I find this inconsistent with call-by-value reduction and normal order reduction. For example, a lambda term λz.(λx.x) y can be reduced to λz.z when following the normal order reduction rules. But it cannot be further reduced when using call-by-value reduction because call-by-value reduction forbids reduction inside a λ-abstraction. So the term term λz.(λx.x) y cannot be evaluated to the same result using different rules, which seems to contradict to the Church-Rosser theorem. What's the problem here? Please help me out.Thanks a lot!</p>
