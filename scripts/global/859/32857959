<p>For example for this code:</p>  <pre><code>List&lt;Class&gt; classes =          Stream.of("java.lang.Object", "java.lang.Integer", "java.lang.String")               .map(className -&gt; Class.forName(className))               .collect(Collectors.toList()); </code></pre>  <p>This code runs fine now. but, assume we have a empty list in stream and we have tons of operations to the stream. It could get NullPointer exceptions and etc. I find it's also hard to try-catch for this kind of statement. What's the right way to handle exception for this?</p>
