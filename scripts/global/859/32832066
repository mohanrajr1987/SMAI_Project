<p>Using the PyQT library I am currently having issues with binding a function to the dinamically generated pushbuttons resulting from a loop.</p>  <p>So far I have managed to generate the buttons and bind a function to them with the lambda command. The problem is that since I need every single button to open a different file I find myself in an odd situation as all the button do open the same one. The last value assigned to the variable.</p>  <p>Any idea on how to fix the situation? As a last note, sorry in case of stupid mistakes. I am new to OOP and PyQT.</p>  <pre><code>def searchTheStuff(self):         found = 0         data = MainWindow.intermediateCall()         f1 = open('Path.txt', 'r')         path = f1.read()         f1.close()         Yinc = 25         Y = 40         X = 20         results = 0         for path, dirs, files in os.walk(path, topdown=True):             for name in files:                 if name.endswith('.txt'):                     fullpath = os.path.join(path, name)                     mail = open_close(fullpath)                     if mail.find(data) != -1 and results&lt;3:                         found = 1                         self.buttons.append(QtGui.QPushButton(self))                         print fullpath                         command = lambda : webbrowser.open()                         self.buttons[-1].clicked.connect(command)                         self.buttons[-1].setText(_translate("self", name, None))                         self.buttons[-1].setGeometry(QtCore.QRect(X, Y, 220, 20))                         results = results+1                         if results == 33:                             X = 260                             Y = 15                         Y = Y + Yinc         if found == 0:             self.label = QtGui.QLabel(self)             self.label.setGeometry(QtCore.QRect(20, 40, 321, 21))             self.label.setText(_translate("self", "No templates have been found:", None)) </code></pre>
