<p>Is there a "counterpart" in python for <code>functools.partial</code>?</p>  <p>Namely what I want to avoid is writing:</p>  <pre><code>lambda x, y: f(x) </code></pre>  <p>But I would love to preserve the same attributes (keyword-args, nice repr) as I do when I write:</p>  <pre><code>from functools import partial incr = partial(sum, 1) </code></pre>  <p>instead of</p>  <pre><code>incr = lambda x: sum(1, x) </code></pre>  <p>I know that something like this is very easy to write, but I am wondering if there is already a standard way of ignoring arguments.</p>  <p>One common usecase of this would be Qts Signals and Slots.</p>
