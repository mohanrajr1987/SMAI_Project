<p>I'm writing a little event manager class where I store some function pointers inside a vector. I use <code>std::function&lt;void(int)&gt;</code> as vector type, I tested inserting inside it lambdas and normal functions and it works:</p>  <pre><code>void t(int p){   /*things*/ } [...] event.bind([](int p){/*things*/}); event.bind(t); </code></pre>  <p>Now, <em>(at a certain point I need to delete lambdas but not functions,)</em> my question is:  </p>  <p><strong>Is it possible to distinguish lambdas from functions? If yes, how?</strong></p>  <p><strong>EDIT:</strong><br> Since I clarified my doubts, this question becomes just what the title says</p>
