<p>I am using drupal 7.39 and have created a taxonomy vocabulary named "City" and added few terms in it (london, liverpool,cardiff etc.). Then I created a custom content type (named City) and used "City" taxonomy as term reference field (author city) and type is listbox.</p>  <p>Then I created a view as block and added contextual filter to "author city" field and used following settings</p>  <pre><code>WHEN THE FILTER VALUE IS NOT AVAILABLE     selected = Provide Default Value     Type =  Taxonomy term ID from URL     selected =  Load default filter from term page     And my vocabulary selected (City) </code></pre>  <p>WHEN THE FILTER VALUE IS AVAILABLE OR A DEFAULT IS PROVIDED     checked = Specify validation criteria      Validator = Taxonomy term     Vocabulary = City     Filter value type = Term name converted to Term ID     checked = Transform dashes in URL to spaces in term name filter values</p>  <p>Now if I auto preview section provides filter value "london" it works fine ad shows me values BUT</p>  <p>when I navigate to url tmt:8082/london it does not show any values in block (I have added that block in some region and that region is there on that page by the way I am using custom template for display for City content type).</p>  <p>Any help appreciated. </p>
