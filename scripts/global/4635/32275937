<p>I've read a few questions about MySQL workarounds for linked databases (like in Oracle) and found a simple solution if the tables are within the same MySQL-instance but in different schemas.</p>  <pre><code>CREATE DEFINER = `admin`@`localhost`  SQL SECURITY DEFINER VIEW schema1.my_view AS SELECT c1, c2, c3 FROM schema2.t1; </code></pre>  <p>But I cannot manage to make this view updatable, so I can add, update or delete rows within my_view. Is it possible?</p>  <p>The user admin got dba-rights to the database so it should not be an issue of user rights.</p>
