<p>How can I load multiple views on a single template?</p>  <p>For example I have my main page splitted in 2 columns and I want to add a view on the left column and another, different view on the right column.</p>  <p>What code do I need to put in which files in order to acomplish this? I want to mention that I know how to add a single view per template. Be that as it may I'm still learning.</p>  <p>I've read this -- <a href="https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/wiki/Multiple-Named-Views" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/wiki/Multiple-Named-Views</a> -- but I can't seem to optimize that with Foundation.</p>
