<p>I'm creating an overview page at admin/people where i want to filter and show the listed domains of an user. I've already implemented the views_vbo module for filtering but i can't quite display all the assigned domains of an user.</p>  <p>I only get the first result of the assigned domains when i use the field:</p>  <p>"Domain Editor: Domain ID" which clearly states in the description: "The domain(s) an editor is assigned to.", is there any way to display all the users' domains?</p>
