<p>Am having a problem with the <strong>distribution of the WebApi HelpPage views</strong> which are located in separate project in the same solution. Help works OK when starting the WebApi stand-alone, but fails when running the MVC client project. Then I get the error <em>"view 'Index' or its master was not found or no view engine supports the searched locations"</em></p>  <p>The way <strong>I got it to work now is to duplicate the helppage view folders in both projects</strong>. Is there a better way to include them (without folder duplication)? They need to be available in both startup modes.</p>  <p>The ASP.Net MVC web solution contains a <strong>ASP.MVC Web client project</strong> and a <strong>separate MVC WebAPI2 project</strong>. The WebApi project contains automated helppages via the asp.net-web-api-helppages plugin. If I run the WebApi project by itself the help pages for the API all run fine (~/help). </p>  <p>If I start the MVC Web Client project (which includes the WebApi) then the help pages do no longer work. The url routing is still working ~/help will use the right controller. However, it cannot load the helppage views since this project does not contain the Areas/HelpPage/Views folder in the distribution. This is rather obvious when you think about it, but somehow duplicating the view folders feels a bit redundant as well. So who has a better solution? </p>
