<p>I have a problem with the following scenario. I set up a node with a <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/date" rel="nofollow">date field</a> with type "Date (ISO format)". To display that nodes in a RSS feed, i created a view from content and format RSS-feed. In addition i set up a custom date format via "r" (RFC 2822) or (D, d M Y H:i:s O) in Drupal and used it for that field "field_time". That field is used as pubDate.</p>  <p>The date field creates instead of:</p>  <pre><code>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0200 </code></pre>  <p>the "german" version.</p>  <pre><code>Mi, 01 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0200 </code></pre>  <p>If i do the same with for example the "created" date i get the correct english output.</p>  <p>I have allready tried to set the "field language" of that view to english.  Also i tried to programmatically change the output in the rows tpl (overwhelming my php knowledge). </p>  <p>Its a very similar case like <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/812260" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>  <p>Maybe someone can get me a hint to alter that field, change it in the rows template or something similar. Thanks in advance!</p>
