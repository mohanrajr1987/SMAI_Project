<p>How do I pass the selected value/text from telerik Kendo autocomplete to my Controller? I saw the examples but they are accessing the selected item on the same view NOT passing to the controller. Also I am creating my autocomplete using viewbag as datasource. Updated: I would like to access the selected value on AccessSelecteditem(txtNames) function when submit button is clicked. I reason I am trying to do it this way is, this approach works for html.dropdownlist. </p>  <pre><code>My kendo autocomplete in view.  @using(Html.BeginForm("Index","Home") @Code Html.Kendo().AutoComplete() _ .Name("txtNames") _ .DataTextField("Text") _ .BindTo(ViewBag.txtData) _ .Filter("Contains") _ .Suggest(True) _ .MinLength(4) _ .Render() End Code       End Using &lt;input type="submit" value="Submit"&gt;   Function Index() As ActionResult ‘ Here I am storing the selectitemlist into a viewbag which I used as a datasource for my kendo combobox     ViewBag. txtData = getDataForKendo()     Return View()  End Function  Function AccessSelecteditem(txtNames) As ActionResult ‘ Here I am trying to get the selected value/text value from the kendo   comobox. Dim selectedItem = txtNames.selecteditem            Return View() End Function </code></pre>
