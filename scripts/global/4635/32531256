<p>I am using Drupal 7.</p>  <p>In a node, I have a field collection, and in that field collection I have a field called 'amount' which is an integer field.</p>  <p>When I try to display this value within a view column using 'Views PHP' module, in the available variables it appears as </p>  <p>$row->field_amount: Field collection item: amount</p>  <p>However when I print/echo this, the value that appears is not correct. It seems to show the ID of the field collection or so.</p>  <p>On extra note, the view is a taxonomy view. It is deriving the field collection field using a relationship to the node.</p>  <p>How can I get it to show the actual value inserted in views php?</p>
