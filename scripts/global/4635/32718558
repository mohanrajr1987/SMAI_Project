<p>I'm using the Types Toolset plugin (CRED form actually), and every time I try to click the button that says "Add another Notification", the data doesn't open in the backend to enter the information.</p>  <p>Instead I get this error:</p>  <pre><code>Uncaught TypeError: window.switchEditors.switchto is not a function </code></pre>  <p>This is the line of code that error is attached to:</p>  <pre><code>window.switchEditors.switchto(document.getElementById(newId + '-tmce')); </code></pre>  <p>Any idea what I should do? The plugin work perfectly except the JS error doesn't open the notification details in the back-end.</p>
