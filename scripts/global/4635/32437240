<p>Maintaining database views in mysql is sometimes cumbersome. When you change a referred table you have to alter the table and there is no clean way to do that in migrations (<code>DB::unprepared()</code>). I guess using <a href="http://laravel.com/docs/5.1/eloquent#query-scopes" rel="nofollow">query scopes</a> in models is more maintainable. Isn't it?  Does it has negative effect on the performance.</p>
