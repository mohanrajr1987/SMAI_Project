<p>I have a view that lists items that have "expiry" dates. For example:</p>  <pre><code>Item 1: Expired yesterday [EXPIRED] Item 2: Expires in an hour [NOT EXPIRED] Item 3: Expires in 5 hours [NOT EXPIRED] </code></pre>  <p>If I order by data asc, I get this order. The problem is, I want:</p>  <pre><code>Item 2: Expires in an hour [NOT EXPIRED] Item 3: Expires in 5 hours [NOT EXPIRED] Item 1: Expired yesterday [EXPIRED] </code></pre>  <p>So that all expired items fall to the bottom. </p>  <p>I would imagine I need to somehow create another field that indicates "expired" and then sort by that too, but I don't know how to sort by a "generated" field, if you know what I mean?</p>
