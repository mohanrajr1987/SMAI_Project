<p>I am trying to make a database with several people listed in the user database using MySQL. I am trying to make it so that it will list all the people in the database that he is under.</p>  <p>I also have a database Supervisors, which two foreign keys to users that show each person that person supervises. (Admin A supervises Manager A, Admin A supervises Manager B, Manager A supervises Employee A)</p>  <p>So for example, We have an Admin A, who supervise Manager A and Manager, who supervise Employee A and Employee B, respectfully. I want to know how can I make a such that The Admin A can generate a view to show the people who are under him (Manager A, Manager B, Employee A, and Employee B), but will not be able to see the people who he is not under, such Admin B and CEO.</p>
