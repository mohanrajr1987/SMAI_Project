<p>Let's say I have a <code>UserProfileController#show</code> which renders a user's profile account page. The associated views and partials for this controller are under <code>/app/views/user_profile/*</code></p>  <p>As with any UserProfile page, the user should be able to edit their preferences. This is done by clicking a preferences link which triggers the <code>UserPreferences#show</code> and it displays a whole new page by rendering the views under <code>/app/views/user_preferences/*</code></p>  <p>My current issue is that the latter page is a whole separate page that I have to link to. I'd love to instead be able to bring up the preferences page in a modal without leaving the user profile page. Or maybe I just want it embedded in the profile page itself at the bottom (i.e. it doesn't have to necessarily be a popup modal - wasn't looking for a specific answer to that). </p>  <p>The issue is that I have no way to call a whole new controller and action from my current <code>UserProfileController</code> view. Is there a way to call this new route and have it generate the whole new page within my current page?</p>  <p>The only answer I've received so far is that I should consider doing it all from the same controller, but that's really overloading the <code>UserProfileController</code> and my action method is becoming long and messy. </p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
