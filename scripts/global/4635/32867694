<p>I'm having issues using the <code>views_get_view</code> function in Drupal.</p>  <p>If I use the following on a URL such as <code>/our-people</code> it works fine but as soon as a query string is added for pages <code>/our-people?page=27</code> then it just doesn't load at all.</p>  <pre><code>$view = views_get_view('debt_footer_news'); print $view-&gt;render($view-&gt;vid); </code></pre>
