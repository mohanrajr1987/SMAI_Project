<p>I'm working on an android project where I have a set of views (2 TextViews and some checkboxes in a checkbox group) to replicate many time in the same activity. Is it possible to define the layout only for one set and instantiate it many time? Also, the views are grouped in a Relative layout, is it possible to position the without the id attributes (to avoid id duplication)?</p>
