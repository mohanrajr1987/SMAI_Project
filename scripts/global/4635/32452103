<p>I have created a vbo view that shows the list of nodes and a vbo operation that will will save the content.</p>  <p>My problem now is that when a node has a custom url alias, (meaning that the 'Generate automatic URL alias' is not checked and the 'URL alias' textbox is used), after saving the node turns back to its default url alias.</p>  <p>lets say:</p>  <p>I have a node with a custom alias of </p>  <pre><code> **`localhost/custom/url/node_title`**  </code></pre>  <p>and its the default url alias of that node is </p>  <pre><code> **`localhost/default/url/node_title`** </code></pre>  <p>so, after the bulk operation, the node url changes back to <strong><code>localhost/default/url/node_title</code></strong>.</p>  <p>Thank you very much!</p>
