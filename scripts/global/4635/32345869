<p>I have created a View:Block that shows videos.Here is the information on the View:Block - </p>  <p>Format Format: MediaFront Player | Settings</p>  <p>Fields Content: Title Content: Image Upload (Image Upload) - For thumbnail of the video Content: Media Upload (Media Upload)</p>  <p>Filter criteria Content: Published (Yes) Content: Type (= About us Videos)</p>  <p>Sort criteria (queue) Nodequeue: Position (asc)</p>  <p>There is a user role for managing videos. The user can login and add/delete videos. The user can log in and add a video and thumbnail and the content gets added because it is visible in the list of added contents but when I visit the page where it should be displayed I am not able to see the video. I have also used Nodequeue to list the videos. Problem is video gets added but doesn't display in the block. </p>
