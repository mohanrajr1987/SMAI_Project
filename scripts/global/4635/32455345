<p>I am building a food blog site using Drupal 7 panels. There are 3 content types that can be tagged with the taxonomy vocabulary tags.</p>  <p>Tags Taxonomy has the terms “BBQ”, “Vegetarian”, “Low Carb”, “Dinner Party”.</p>  <p>There are 3 content types - “recipes”, “ideas” and “news”.</p>  <p>I want to be able to add content to a panel pane based on one of the taxonomy tags. The title of the taxonomy tag should show up followed by boxes containing the 3 most recent items from the each of the content types.</p>  <p>I can not figure out how this can be accomplished with panels/views</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/RmEO6.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/RmEO6.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
