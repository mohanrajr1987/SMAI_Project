<p>I wish to create a view which joins two tables together.</p>  <p>T1 =</p>  <pre><code>Col1 Col2 AA   BB EE   FF YY   ZZ 11   00 </code></pre>  <p>T2 =</p>  <pre><code>Col1 Col2 Col3 AA   BB   1 AA   CC   2 CC   BB   3 GG   FF   4 GG   HH   5 EE   HH   6 XX   YY   7 XX   WW   8 YY   RR   9 </code></pre>  <p>The rules for this view are a Best match scenario based upon the following rules:</p>  <pre><code>1. Return Col3 from T2 if T1.Col1 &amp; T1.Col2 = T2.Col1 &amp; T2.Col2 ELSE 2. Return Col3 if T1.Col2 = T2.Col2 ELSE 3. Return Col3 if T1.Col = T2.Col1 ELSE 4. Return NULL </code></pre>  <p>So in these examples I would expect the final view to contain:</p>  <pre><code>AA BB 1   (Rule 1 match) EE FF 4   (Rule 2 match) YY ZZ 9   (Rule 3 match) 11 00 NULL (Rule 4 match) </code></pre>  <p>The difficulty I am having is in the cases where it hits multiple rules (e.g. Rows 1 and 3 where rules 1 and 2 are hit or Rows 4 and 6 where rules 2 and 3 are hit separately).</p>  <p>I realise in this example that Rule 3 is hit multiple times - this is fine as the idea is it will only hit rule 3 when the other rules aren't true which <em>should</em> only ever yield 1 result (like in example 3).</p>  <p>Is there a way to do a similar union to cater for these cascading rules or will additional views need to creating with pre-filtering (such as having count &lt; 2)? </p>  <p>A formula for this in excel would be: =IF(AND(A3=$F$2,B3=$G$2),"Rule1",IF((B3=$G$2),"Rule 2",IF((A3=$F$2),"Rule 3","NULL")))</p>  <p>Where A3 = T2.Col1, B3 = T2.Col2 G2 = T1.Col2 and F2 = T1.Col1.</p>
