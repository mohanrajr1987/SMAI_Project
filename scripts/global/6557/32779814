<p>I am developing an app which contains filters, while developing i strucked at a point where it means when i am applying opacity values to the bitmap getting empty bitmap(it is displaying as black) as like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30259908/how-can-i-apply-the-opacity-immutable-bitmaps-in-android">this</a> in Samsung s4 only. The same code working fine for remaining all devices.</p>  <p><strong>here is the code what i used :</strong></p>  <pre><code>private Bitmap combining(Bitmap base, Bitmap blend, int opacity) {      BitmapFactory.Options options = new BitmapFactory.Options();     options.inPreferredConfig = Bitmap.Config.ARGB_8888;     Bitmap result = null;     result = base.copy(Config.ARGB_8888, true);     Bitmap bit= Bitmap.createBitmap(blend.getWidth(),             blend.getHeight(), Config.ARGB_8888);       Bitmap mutableBitmap = bit.isMutable()? bit: bit.copy(Bitmap.Config.ARGB_8888, true);      Canvas canvas = new Canvas(mutableBitmap);      int colour = ((opacity &lt;&lt; 24) &amp; 0xFF000000);      canvas.drawColor(colour, Mode.DST_IN);     bit=mutableBitmap;     return bit;} </code></pre>  <p>i think its duplicate question but there is no answer for that question </p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30259908/how-can-i-apply-the-opacity-immutable-bitmaps-in-android">How can i apply the opacity immutable bitmaps in android?</a></p>  <p>I am also facing same issue but in my observation those are not immutable bitmaps but its displaying as black(empty) as said above. i googled but i didn't find solution.</p>  <p>How can i rectify this?  please give me some suggestions and some snippet of code.</p>
