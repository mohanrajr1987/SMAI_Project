<p>here is my database columns: you see that in the last column i put BLOB.</p>  <pre><code>  @Override public void onCreate(SQLiteDatabase db) {     db.execSQL("create table " + TABLE_NAME + " (ID TEXT PRIMARY KEY,PASSWORD TEXT,FNAME TEXT,SNAME TEXT,BIRTHDATE TEXT,MATHGROUP TEXT,GENDER TEXT, PROFILEIMAGE BLOB)"); } </code></pre>  <p>i asked from user to choose an image from gallery. the image is saved in a bitmap.  i have Bitmap bitmap. when i want to insert the data, i need to convert bitmap to byte []. so:</p>  <pre><code>ByteArrayOutputStream stream1 = new ByteArrayOutputStream();                         bitmap.compress(Bitmap.CompressFormat.JPEG, 100, stream1);                         byte [] buffer = stream1.toByteArray(); </code></pre>  <p>and I insert the data. (the method is defined in the DatabaseHelper class).</p>  <pre><code>   boolean isInserted = myDb.insertData(editID.getText().toString(),                                 editPASSWORD.getText().toString(),                                 editFNAME.getText().toString(),                                 editSNAME.getText().toString(),                                 datePickerBIRTHDATE.getDayOfMonth() + "." + datePickerBIRTHDATE.getMonth() + "." + datePickerBIRTHDATE.getYear(),                                 spinnerMATHGROUP.getSelectedItem().toString(), spinnerGENDER.getSelectedItem().toString(), buffer ); </code></pre>  <p>i succeed to insert that. so the first user is sigen-up now. but i cant do more now. if the user enters ID and pass, and i start to check a match with his details to data details, the app fails (goes out with note)! i dont have access to database information.  The problem is for sure with the BLOB column (or what i put in it that makes the database crash). I assume that because when I remove that column, i have no problem with login.  whats wrong with the code?</p>  <p><strong>Here is Logcat</strong></p>  <pre><code>    18:49:20 Gradle sync started 18:49:36 Gradle sync completed 18:49:38 Executing tasks: [:app:generateDebugSources, :app:generateDebugAndroidTestSources] 18:50:23 Gradle build finished in 44s 138ms 18:51:12 Throwable          Read access is allowed from event dispatch thread or inside read-action only (see com.intellij.openapi.application.Application.runReadAction())          Details: Current thread: Thread[ApplicationImpl pooled thread 31,4,main] 1159879404          ; dispatch thread: false; isDispatchThread(): false          SystemEventQueueThread: Thread[AWT-EventQueue-0 1.3#AI-141.2178183, eap:false,6,main] 393216142 18:52:23 Throwable          Read access is allowed from event dispatch thread or inside read-action only (see com.intellij.openapi.application.Application.runReadAction())          Details: Current thread: Thread[ApplicationImpl pooled thread 31,4,main] 1159879404          ; dispatch thread: false; isDispatchThread(): false          SystemEventQueueThread: Thread[AWT-EventQueue-0 1.3#AI-141.2178183, eap:false,6,main] 393216142 19:02:29 Executing tasks: [:app:assembleDebug] 19:02:35 Gradle build finished with 8 error(s) in 5s 814ms 19:03:41 Executing tasks: [:app:assembleDebug] 19:04:41 Gradle build finished in 59s 960ms 19:06:09 Executing tasks: [:app:assembleDebug] 19:06:11 Gradle build finished in 2s 559ms 19:08:10 Executing tasks: [:app:assembleDebug] 19:08:13 Gradle build finished in 3s 234ms 19:09:07 Executing tasks: [:app:assembleDebug] 19:09:10 Gradle build finished in 2s 520ms 19:11:03 Executing tasks: [:app:assembleDebug] 19:11:06 Gradle build finished in 2s 985ms 19:12:42 Executing tasks: [:app:assembleDebug] 19:12:44 Gradle build finished in 2s 67ms 19:15:39 Executing tasks: [:app:assembleDebug] 19:15:49 Gradle build finished in 10s 219ms 19:17:32 Executing tasks: [:app:assembleDebug] 19:17:41 Gradle build finished in 9s 521ms 19:18:14 Executing tasks: [:app:assembleDebug] 19:18:24 Gradle build finished in 9s 752ms 19:20:13 Executing tasks: [:app:assembleDebug] 19:20:23 Gradle build finished in 9s 445ms 20:02:46 Executing tasks: [:app:assembleDebug] 20:02:56 Gradle build finished in 10s 187ms 20:04:06 Executing tasks: [:app:assembleDebug] 20:04:17 Gradle build finished in 11s 160ms 20:04:45 Executing tasks: [:app:assembleDebug] 20:05:01 Gradle build finished in 15s 963ms 20:05:14 Executing tasks: [:app:assembleDebug] 20:05:24 Gradle build finished in 9s 832ms 20:06:17 Executing tasks: [:app:assembleDebug] 20:06:19 Gradle build finished in 2s 449ms 20:06:53 Executing tasks: [:app:assembleDebug] 20:06:56 Gradle build finished in 3s 202ms 20:09:25 Executing tasks: [:app:assembleDebug] 20:09:28 Gradle build finished in 2s 552ms </code></pre>
