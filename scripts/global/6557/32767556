<p>I have an application but I realised that it's not very smart to use absolute URLS for load images in a bitmap.</p>  <p>This is my piece of code:</p>  <pre><code>var searchingBitmap = new Bitmap(@"c:\images\searching.png"); </code></pre>  <p>Now I want to include the files in my project (I did that by adding new files in a "images" map in my solution.</p>  <p>But how can I refactor that absolute url to the images folder in my project images folder?</p>  <p>This doesnt work:</p>  <pre><code>var searchingBitmap = new Bitmap(@"images\searching.png"); </code></pre>
