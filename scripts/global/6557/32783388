<p>I have a WPF project where I used a <code>System.Drawing.Bitmap</code> property bound to UI. This is deserialized and serialized using a <code>DataContractSerializer</code>. If I change this to <code>System.Windows.Media.Imaging.BitmapImage</code> then I get null <code>StreamSource</code> after deserialization?</p>  <p>On looking up in SO I found out that it is not possible/advisable to serialize <code>BitmapImage</code>. Can anyone please tell me why it is not possible? </p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
