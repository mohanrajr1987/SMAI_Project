<p>I'm trying to create an application where there is a need of uploading images from my mobile. In this case, when I open my Gallery and choose a image and come back to my application, onCreate() is called again due to which the TextView, EditText and the booleans which I've used earlier are cleared.</p>  <p>I don't want this to happen, I want all the values to remain same and when I come back from Device Gallery to my own application. Can you please help me solving this issue?</p>
