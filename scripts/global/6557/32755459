<p>I am building an app in which i want to mask an image with some certain other images like overlap. Also that mask image contains some text information about image like its name. And when masking is complete user needs to guess name behind mask into that image, if user guess correctly then that mask must be removed from that image. </p>  <p>So far I've done that masking thing by drag and drop mask image into main image. </p>  <p>My problem is how to add extra info to mask image and how to revealed that image by guessing that information. </p>
