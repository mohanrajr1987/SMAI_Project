<p>I have something like:</p>  <pre><code>       public Bitmap GetBitmap()        {                      Byte[] byteArray= bring it from somewhere                 using (Stream stream = new MemoryStream(byteArray))             {                 return new Bitmap(stream);             }         } </code></pre>  <p>When I use this method outside the Bitmap is crushed. but if I stepped into the "using" scope the bitmap will be exists and works fine. it seems that disposing the stream cause disposing the bitmap.. the question is: Do I need some deep copy? how should I perform it?</p>
