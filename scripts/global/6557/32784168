<p>Today I started using the <code>AssetManager</code> from <code>libGDX</code> to load my assets. Before that I already loaded everything in a separate class, but I didn't use the <code>AssetManager</code>.<br> How I currently load the Bitmap Font:     </p>  <pre><code>manager.load("font/good_neighbors_unity.fnt", BitmapFont.class); [...] bFont = manager.get("font/good_neighbors_unity.fnt", BitmapFont.class); </code></pre>  <p>My problem is that the bitmap font I use is upside down when I load it with the Asset Manager. This is due to the fact that in my orthographic camera, <em>y</em> is pointing down. In the Bitmap Font constructor there is a boolean to flip the font and avoid this problem. But there seems to be no such option when I load it with the <code>AssetManager</code>. There is probably a relatively easy solution to this, but I can't find any method that allows me to flip the font afterwards. Is there an option that allows me flip the bitmap font while using the <code>AssetManager</code>?</p>
