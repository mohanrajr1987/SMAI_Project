<p>I know this topic already exist but i didn't find the answer of my question in the other posts. As the title of this post suggest, i would like to modify the resolution of a bitmap ( NOT A PNG ). Some post i found talk about resizing the bitmap( <a href="http://www.nullskull.com/q/10269424/change-the-resolution-of-png-image-and-save-it.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.nullskull.com/q/10269424/change-the-resolution-of-png-image-and-save-it.aspx</a>) but i would like to avoid this approach. Of course i already tried the <code>SetResolution</code> method but it doesn't work :</p>  <pre><code>        // conversion png to bmp         Source.Save(@"C:\Users\ae40394\Desktop\Image.bmp", ImageFormat.Bmp);         // new bmp          Bitmap bmp = new Bitmap(@"C:\Users\ae40394\Desktop\Image.bmp");         // copy of bmp         Bitmap newBitmap = new Bitmap(bmp);         // change resolution         newBitmap.SetResolution(800.0f, 800.0f);         // Save         newBitmap.Save(@"C:\Users\ae40394\Desktop\Image2.bmp", ImageFormat.Bmp); </code></pre>  <p>thanks ! </p>
