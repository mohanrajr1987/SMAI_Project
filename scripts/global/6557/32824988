<p>I asked from user to choose image from his gallery (for his profile image). i saved the image as a bitmap and i displayed it in his profile activity. that means thet i know how to display bitmap and my method for choosing image from gallery works fine. now, i want to save it in database. i dont know if i should save only the path  as string or the bitmap as blob. if i save the path only, i think that other users can not see his image, becuase the image is stored in his DCIM, and other users dont have access to there.  so i decided to save the bitmap as blob. can someone please please give me working code for: - saving bitmap in database (blob i think, byte [] or something). - retrieve the data into sharedreference. -from sharedpreferene eventually to bitmap again. if you have an idea for how saving the images not in db, answer that. i have heard that i should avoid of saving images in db becuase it slows the app. </p>
