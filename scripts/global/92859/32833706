<p>I have an object that is randomly moving, and other objects are spawning next to it.</p>  <p>How can I change the gravity direction of the objects that are being spawned to make it so the spawned objects are always moving towards my randomly moving object?</p>  <p>In my <code>didMoveToView</code> I tried adding the following:</p>  <pre><code>self.physicsWorld.gravity = CGVectorMake(costantlyMovingObject.position.x, constantlyMovingObject.position.y) </code></pre>  <p>But this just causes the spawned objects to fly around like crazy</p>
