<p>Since SpriteKit does not allow the adjustments of specific variables, specifically the velocity threshold, I am forced to include Box2d myself and create the things I need. In sprite kit, they have a very nice function to take a CGPath and turn it into a physics body (     <code>[SKPhysicsBody bodyWithEdgeChainFromPath:nonnull CGPathRef&gt;]</code>). Is there any way I could do this same functionality with Box2d itself?</p>  <p><strong>So far</strong>, I have created a circle with a CGPath using:</p>  <p><code>CGPathAddArc(path, NULL, 0, 0, 75, degreesToRadians(360), degreesToRadians(0), true);</code></p>  <p>My initial though was to loop through the points that the CGPath has and just use those as vertices for the Box2d version. This was an issue because it seems that a CGPath are along the lines of commands. With my path above, there are only four elements which are composed of setting the start point and then curving around the circle.</p>  <p>I have been able to just create a circle for Box2d by defining the number of vertices I want, the center point, and the radius. This works fine but is not really what I am looking for because it poses two problems. The first is that I will have many different shapes most of them will be complex polygons which will be very tedious to create for every shape. The second is that the line width is more than one pixel. This means that objects go through the border of the circle and only hit the middle of the borders. I can solve this by creating two bodies, one around the inside of the line and the other on the outside. This makes the process tedious*2.</p>  <p><strong>Note</strong></p>  <p>The circle is hollow that's why I can't just create the object as a circle. Also, it will be many different objects, this is just an example.</p>
