<p>I have simple game that has some spritenode with images that I have in an asset catalog, is configured for ipad only and I have 2 versions of the images, one 1x and 2x, the thing is that the game was created in ios 8 and is was working perfect, now when I opened in xcode 7 with ios 9 it suggest me to convert the code to swift 2 which I did, the process told it need to change like 2 things, nothing big because the game is kinda simple.</p>  <p>The problem I have is when I start the game in the simulator or and ipad with ios 9 the images sometimes load at the beginning and then they just disappear  and sometimes they don't even appear at all, I had try to insert the images again but without any result, also I tried to create a new project also no result.</p>  <p>I have no idea why this is happening, please any help will be appreciate</p>
