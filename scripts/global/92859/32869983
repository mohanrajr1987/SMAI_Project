<p>My problem is when I am trying to switch to a scene, the view of it is different when it was my start scene. </p>  <p>The problem is -I think- the scale mode, so I tried to set the scale mode but it didn't work. This what I have tried:</p>  <pre><code>let skView = self.view! as SKView  let gameScene:GameScene = GameScene(size: self.frame.size) gameScene.size = skView.bounds.size gameScene.scaleMode = SKSceneScaleMode.ResizeFill  skView.presentScene(gameScene , transition: SKTransition.crossFadeWithDuration(1)) </code></pre>  <p>And this:</p>  <pre><code>let gameScene = GameScene(size: self.size)  gameScene.scaleMode = SKSceneScaleMode.ResizeFill  self.view?.scene!.presentScene(gameScene , transition: SKTransition.crossFadeWithDuration(1)) </code></pre>  <p>And I have tried to set the scale mode of the scene in the <code>didMoveToView()</code> function.</p>  <p>None of these methods helps, any help?</p>
