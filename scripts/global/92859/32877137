<p>In my game in <code>swift</code> / <code>SpriteKit</code>, I have a problem when the user quits the app and opens it up again. If the game is on the pause menu and everything is paused, when the game is reloaded the game is unpaused but the labels on the pause menu do not disappear. How do I keep the game paused when I reopen it? I have tried </p>  <pre><code>    func applicationWillEnterForeground(application: UIApplication) {     // Called as part of the transition from the background to the inactive state; here you can undo many of the changes made on entering the background.     let scene = GameScene(size: CGSize(width: 2048, height: 1356))     scene.view?.paused = true } </code></pre>  <p>But this is not doing anything. I have also tried <code>pause()</code> but that messes things up. Any help is appreciated.</p>
