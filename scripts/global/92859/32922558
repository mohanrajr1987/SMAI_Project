<p>As I understand from <code>init(data pixelData: NSData, size size: CGSize)</code> method description:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>An NSData object that holds the bitmap data. The pixels must be 32   bpp, 8bpc (unsigned integer) RGBA pixel data. The color components   should have been already multiplied by the alpha value.</p> </blockquote>  <p><code>SKTexture</code> always use RGB8888 format. Is it possible to switch to another format to reduce memory usage?</p>
