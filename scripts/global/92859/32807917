<p>If I create an SKPhysicsBody and add it to an SKSpriteNode as below then the collision detection works fine with the floor object below.</p>  <pre><code>let myObjectBody = SKPhysicsBody(circleOfRadius: 100) </code></pre>  <p>However, if instead I create the PhysicsBody using the texture of the SKSpriteNode to which it is applied then the collision doesn't work. Although it <strong>does</strong> register contact, the object just falls through the floor.</p>  <pre><code>let myObjectBody = SKPhysicsBody(texture: myObject.texture!, alphaThreshold: 0, size: myObject.texture!.size()) </code></pre>  <p><strong>Important note</strong>: If I set show physics to true:</p>  <pre><code>skView.showsPhysics = true </code></pre>  <p>Then the physics outline matches perfectly the outline of the shape of the sprite, which is generated from a png.</p>  <p>The physicsBody is added to the object and then the scene in the following manner.</p>  <pre><code>let myTexture = SKTexture(imageNamed: "myImage") let myObject = SKSpriteNode(texture: myTexture) myObject.xScale = 0.2 myObject.yScale = 0.2 //The image is big to allow zooming  let myObjectBody = SKPhysicsBody(texture: myObject.texture!, alphaThreshold: 0, size: myObject.texture!.size())  myObject.physicsBody = myObjectBody myWorld.addChild(myObject) </code></pre>
