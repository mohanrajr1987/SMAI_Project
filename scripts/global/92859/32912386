<p>Here is the following code I code to play the video. If I click a button then it calls a method which has this code snippet for playing the video:</p>  <pre><code>if let urlStr = NSBundle.mainBundle().pathForResource("into_main_v3", ofType: "mp4")     {         let url = NSURL(fileURLWithPath: urlStr)         print(url)         player = AVPlayer(URL: url)          videoNode = SKVideoNode(AVPlayer: player!)         videoNode?.position = CGPointMake(frame.size.width/2, frame.size.height/2)         videoNode?.size = CGSize(width: self.size.width, height: self.size.height)         videoNode?.zPosition = 1         addChild(videoNode!)          videoNode!.play()     } </code></pre>  <p>I get this message printed in my console: : calling -display has no effect.</p>  <p>When I click the button it goes to this method but never goes beyond the urlStr variable. I triple checked and the resource is available in my project for the mp4 video but it still won't run! Its not in any folder, the path is correct. It worked before but suddenly its not working, no idea why!</p>
