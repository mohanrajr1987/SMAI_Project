<p>I am working on a SpriteKit game project that was running at 60 FPS in iOS 8.4</p>  <p>Since iOS 9, I am seeing performance drop to about 30FPS on iPhone 4S. </p>  <p>I have sprites (about 20-30 at once in a scene) that have their zRotation property set to something greater than 0.0 (e.g. 120). </p>  <p>When I add a SKLightNode and configure it to light up the sprites, I get my performance drop. Running Apple's performance tools only leeds me to some system libraries related to SKView Rendering.</p>  <p>If I set the zRotation property of the sprites to 0.0, the game runs at 60 FPS once again. My gave uses rotation heavily, so keeping it at 0.0 is not an option for me. </p>  <p>Any advice would be greatly appreciated. </p>  <p>Thanks, Rado.</p>
