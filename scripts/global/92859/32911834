<p>I'm developing a small game in Swift and there's something I've been struggling with. In this custom class, I am using <code>touchesBegan</code> method, and within this method I want to create an SkNode. This is my code:</p>  <pre><code>class TouchableSpriteNode : SKSpriteNode      {       override func touchesBegan(touches: Set&lt;UITouch&gt;, withEvent event: UIEvent?) {          self.removeFromParent()         let delay = Int(arc4random_uniform(UInt32(200)))*Int(NSEC_PER_SEC)/100         let time = dispatch_time(DISPATCH_TIME_NOW, Int64(delay))         dispatch_after(time, dispatch_get_main_queue()) {             let random2 = arc4random_uniform(UInt32(self.frame.size.width))             let random3 = arc4random_uniform(UInt32(self.frame.size.height))              div.position = CGPoint(x: Int(random2), y: Int(random3))             self.addChild(div)         }         } } </code></pre>  <p>the problem is, I can't get it displayed on the screen, because I get an error which says that you can't that child, because it's his own parent(it's complicated), the thing I want know is how could I say add the child to the scene, not to this skspritenode? Any help is appreciated! Thanks</p>
