<p>I am developing a small <code>iOS</code> game in <code>swift</code>. I have got an image randomly appearing on the screen when you tap it. At the bottom I have an iAd banner. When generating random place,<code>arc4random</code> sometimes generates a place where the image is half off-screen or on the <code>iAd</code>. I would like to prevent it from doing that. How could I do that? Any help is appreciated, really! Thanks!</p>
