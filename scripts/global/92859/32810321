<p>I am trying to use the Easy-Game-Center by DaRkD0G from GitHub in my game (swift sprite kit). However, when calling the EasyGameCenter.Swift (using </p>  <pre><code>        EasyGameCenter.sharedInstance(self) </code></pre>  <p>in my GameScene)  I get an error saying "Cannot convert value of type 'GameScene' to expected argument type 'UIViewController'". For the past couple days, I have tried changing up the different class types in EasyGameCenter but always get answers. Does anyone have any suggestions?</p>
