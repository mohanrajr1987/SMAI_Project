<p>I'm trying to lower my memory usage by using RGBA4444_COMPRESSED format for SpriteKit atlas folders (not asset catalogs).</p>  <p>Using Allocation tool in Instruments shows that the 2048x2048 atlas texture still take ~16MB of memory when I preload the atlas.</p>  <p>I assumed that RGBA4444 should only consume half the amount of memory compared to RGBA8888.</p>  <p>I testing with iPad Air and iOS9.0.</p>
