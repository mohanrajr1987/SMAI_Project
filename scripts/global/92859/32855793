<p>I have been playing around trying to learn spritekit in xcode7. So far I have a level that is larger than the screen, a hero the I can move around and a camera that follows the hero as he moves off the the viewable screen area. Next I'm trying to create a hud at the top and bottom of the screen. The bottom one would be where the joystick/buttons live.</p>  <p>I tried something like this:</p>  <pre><code>let hud = SKSpriteNode(color: SKColor.blackColor(), size: CGSizeMake(self.size.width, self.size.height * 0.05)) hud.anchorPoint = CGPointMake(0, 0) hud.position = CGPointMake(0, (self.view?.bounds.height)! - hud.size.height) self.addChild(hud) </code></pre>  <p>But this puts a black view at the top of my level and I can only see it if I walk my hero up there.  That means if I move it to the bottom, as soon as my hero walks up the joystick and buttons will be off the screen.</p>  <p>Can anyone please provide any direction on how I can add huds to sprite-kit that are always at the top and bottom of the viewable area, while still allowing the hero to move around the level?</p>
