<p>I am developing a small game but I'm stuck on this. I want to generate a random position for an SKSpriteNode called div. I have this code</p>  <pre><code>    let random = arc4random() % UInt32(self.frame.size.width)     let random1 = arc4random() % UInt32(self.frame.size.height)      div.position = CGPoint(x: Int(random), y: Int(random1))      self.addChild(div) </code></pre>  <p>I can't figure out what's wrong and why the div is sometimes out of the frame and not visible. Does anyone has a good solution for this? Any help is appreciated! Thanks!</p>
