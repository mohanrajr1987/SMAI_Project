<p>I have a project in Sprite Kit and I am trying to make it so that a timer gradually decreases. For example if the timer float variable is set at 3.0, this would gradually decrease and be at 0, 3 seconds later. With the way that updates work in sprite kit its a horrible mess trying to get an integer to gradually decrease. </p>  <p>For example:</p>  <pre><code>time+=1; </code></pre>  <p>If I was to put this in an update void, it would increment extremely quickly and differently depending on frames and so forth. Is there a way I can Increment or Decrement a value at a steady rate no despite the fps in Sprite Kit?</p>
