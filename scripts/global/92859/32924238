<p>I'm quite new to SpriteKit and coding in general. I am trying to setup a SKPhysicsJoint in my characters .m file. However, I can't use the physicsWorld syntax as it is not a scene.</p>  <p>How would i get round this?</p>  <p>I have a parent node with two children inside, one small circle sprite with a physicsBody of the same size. I want to add a second circle physicsBody twice the radius with the same centre point. This is so I can handle collisions at different distances.</p>  <p>I've tried defining the SKPhysicsJoint in my characters .h file and using physicsWorld in the scene file but this didn't work.</p>  <p>I'm I going about this the right way or is a much simpler solution that I have overlooked.</p>
