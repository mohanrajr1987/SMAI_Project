<p>In my touchesbegan, if i click on the same SKShapeNode, depending on what name that SKShapeNode has at the time of being touched, it runs this code below.</p>  <pre><code>if node.name == "0.5" { "Do something here"  if node.name == "1.0" { "Do something else here" </code></pre>  <p>This code works fine. But I am trying to do something similar with contact bodies. At the moment I have a code like this:</p>  <pre><code>  if ((contactBody1.categoryBitMask == 1) &amp;&amp; (contactBody2.categoryBitMask == 3)) {    if contactBody2.name == "0.5" {   "Do something here"    } else if contactBody2.name == "1.0" {   "Do something else here" </code></pre>  <p>However Xcode does not recognise ".name" for contact bodies like it does in my touches began method. It says "Value of SKPhysicsBody has no member 'name'"</p>  <p>How can I identify the ".name" of the contact body when it detects a contact between two objects?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
