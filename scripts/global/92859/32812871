<p>I've been looking for a solution for quite a while now, but I can't help finding one. The situation is as following: I created an <code>SKSpriteNode</code> with an image, by the method <code>touchesBegan</code> I want to interact with it, like if one touches the image, something should change. The problem is that the hitbox around this image is square-shaped and not adjusted to the shape of the image. Has anyone got any clue how I can solve this problem? I tried doing it by changing the <code>physicsBody</code> like this   </p>  <pre><code>CGFloat offsetX = node.frame.size.width * node.anchorPoint.x; CGFloat offsetY = node.frame.size.height * node.anchorPoint.y;  CGMutablePathRef path = CGPathCreateMutable(); CGPathCloseSubpath(path);  node.physicsBody = [SKPhysicsBody bodyWithPolygonFromPath:path]; </code></pre>  <p>Seems like the <code>touchesBegan</code> method doesn't use the <code>physicsBody</code> shape but the actual shape, I tried my best explaining it, sorry if I confused you.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>  <p>Julian</p>
