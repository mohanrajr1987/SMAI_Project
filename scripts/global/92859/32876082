<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL0R-zOEPH0&amp;feature=youtu.be" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is a video of the issue I am having. As you can see in the video, I move a gray ball to try and collide with a red ball. When the two objects collide no bouncing occurs, the red ball just moves. I've tried playing around with the densities of the red balls, such as making the red ball densities 0.00001. There was no difference in the collision behavior.</p>  <p>How can I change the collision behavior so there is bouncing?</p>  <p>Here are the properties of the gray ball: </p>  <pre><code>func propertiesGrayBall() {     gray = SKShapeNode(circleOfRadius: frame.width / 10 )     gray.physicsBody = SKPhysicsBody(circleOfRadius: frame.width / 10 )     gray.physicsBody?.affectedByGravity = false     gray.physicsBody?.dynamic = true     gray.physicsBody?.allowsRotation = false     gray.physicsBody?.restitution = 1 } </code></pre>  <p>Here are the properties of the red ball:</p>  <pre><code>func propertiesRedBall  {     let redBall = SKShapeNode(circleOfRadius: self.size.width / 20     redBall.physicsBody = SKPhysicsBody(self.size.width / 20)     redBall.physicsBody?.affectedByGravity = false     redBall.physicsBody?.dynamic = true     redBall.physicsBody?.density = redBall.physicsBody!.density * 0.000001     redBall.physicsBody?.allowsRotation = false     redBall.physicsBody?.restitution = 1 } </code></pre>  <p>Here is how I move the gray ball.</p>  <pre><code>override func touchesMoved(touches: Set&lt;UITouch&gt;, withEvent event: UIEvent?) {     if fingerIsOnGrayBall {         let touch = touches.first         var position = touch!.locationInView(self.view)         position = self.convertPointFromView(position)         grayBall.position = position     } } </code></pre>  <p><strong>Major Edits</strong> The ball originally had attachments. I deleted them to simplify the problem. That's why the comments might not add up with the code.</p>
