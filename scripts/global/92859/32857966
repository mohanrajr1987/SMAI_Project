<p>I created a rope based off <a href="http://www.raywenderlich.com/82022/create-game-like-cut-the-rope-using-sprite-kit-swift" rel="nofollow">this</a> tutorial, except my rope has one ball attached on each end of the rope. </p>  <p>High Level: This is how they create the rope.</p>  <ol> <li>create an array of <code>SKNodes</code></li> <li>append each rope segment (node) to the array</li> <li>add each node to the screen</li> <li>join each node together to form a rope</li> <li>(Then I add a ball on each end of the rope)</li> </ol>  <p>In my program I move the ball around and basically swing the rope around kind of like a stretchy pendulum.</p>  <p><strong>Here's my issue:</strong> If I swing the rope around very hard, the rope stretches too much! How can I decrease the amount the rope stretches? I don't see a method to decrease the elasticity of the body. </p>  <p>If there is any other information that will be useful please let me know! Thanks in advance</p>
