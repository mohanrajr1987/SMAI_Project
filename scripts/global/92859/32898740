<p>I'm having a little problem while developing a small <code>iOS</code> game. In <code>touchesbegan</code>, I add the <code>arc4random</code> called div to the screen, but in this method:</p>  <pre><code>class TouchableSpriteNode : SKSpriteNode {     override func touchesBegan(touches: Set&lt;UITouch&gt;, withEvent event: UIEvent?) {          print("Touch")          self.removeAllChildren()       } </code></pre>  <p>I want to remove the image from the screen again. This class get's called when the <code>node</code> itself is tapped. Any help is appreciated! Thanks!</p>
