<p>I have a SKNode, and when I touch it, under touches began, it runs this code:</p>  <pre><code>if node.name == "0.5" {  node.name = "test"  node.fillColor = UIColor(hue: 1.0, saturation: 1.0, brightness: 1.0, alpha: 1.0) print(node.name)  } else if node.name == "test" {  node.name = "0.5"  node.fillColor = UIColor(hue: 0.4, saturation: 1.0, brightness: 1.0, alpha: 1.0) }  </code></pre>  <p>The above code should change the Node from blue to red and back to blue with each touch on it. It came back saying "optional "test"" so it is registering the name change and color change, but when I click on it again, it doesn't change color again? Why?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
