<p>In my game I am trying to call a function (from my GameScene) in my App Delegate. I made reference from within the DidMoveToView from my GameScene,</p>  <pre><code>NSNotificationCenter.defaultCenter().addObserver(self, selector: "becomeActive", name: UIApplicationDidBecomeActiveNotification, object: nil)      NSNotificationCenter.defaultCenter().addObserver(self, selector: "resignActive", name: UIApplicationWillResignActiveNotification, object: nil) </code></pre>  <p>This works in Swift, but does not work in Swift 2, Xcode is not giving any solutions. I am using these to keep the scene paused when the user exits and reloads the app. How should I initialize the App Delegate in Swift 2?</p>
