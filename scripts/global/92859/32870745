<p>I'm trying to create a hud that sits at the top of the screen and doesn't move with the rest of the scene.  I was able to get a static view up there with this:</p>  <pre><code>class GameScene: SKScene, SKPhysicsContactDelegate {     override func didMoveToView(view: SKView) {         /* Setup your scene here */          let hud = SKView()         hud.alpha = 0.5         hud.backgroundColor = SKColor.greenColor()         hud.frame = CGRect(x: 0.5, y: 0.5, width: view.bounds.width, height: 50)         self.view?.addSubview(hud) </code></pre>  <p>So with that, my player can walk around the scene, the camera follows him, but there is always a transparent view across the top which is what I think I want.</p>  <p>So next I tried adding things to the hud view at the top but I can't seem to figure it out. For example, if I create an SKLabel node I can't add it with hud.addChild because SKView doesn't have addChild. I tried doing hud.addSubview but a SKLabel isn't a UIView, which is what addSubview expects.</p>  <p>Does anyone know how I add things to the hud like labels?</p>
