<p>I just started to learn SceneKit/SpriteKit to develop games, and while I understood the game part (the SCNScene, in my case), I’m not so sure about the menu/hud part.</p>  <p>What I want to do: create an Inventory Screen to show the items the player has in his bag. This screen will appear when the user taps the bag Icon in the HUD. Furthermore, the Inventory Screen must have a UICollectionView-like list to show each item.</p>  <p>Game Hud: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/wyO7e.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/wyO7e.jpg" alt="http://i.imgur.com/duldmoG.jpg"></a> </p>  <p>Inventory Screen: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/3oIIg.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/3oIIg.jpg" alt="http://i.imgur.com/nxaJdQO.jpg"></a> </p>  <p>My question is: should I mix SpriteKit with UIKit to try to accomplish this? Or use just one of them? Should everything be done just with SKScenes that are shown on top of each other (by adding to the OverlaySKScene)?</p>  <p>Currently, I’m presenting the HUD as a SKScene (OverlaySKScene). When the user taps the bag icon, I’m loading a new SKScene (with a bunch of SKSpriteNodes, SKShapeNodes etc) and putting it as the current OverlaySKScene. Now, I’m trying to do the CollectionView part, but don’t know if I should try to implement everything from scratch with SpriteKit or if it’s possible to reuse UICollectionView, with my SKScene as a delegate.</p>  <p>I'm not sure if the way I'm doing is the right way, either.</p>  <p>Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.</p>
