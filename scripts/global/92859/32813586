<p>I'm trying to make a game in iOS, using Swift and Sprite Kit. I have the following bit of codes, but it's creating multiple lines. What I want to do is to create a single line, end of which will follow the tip of the finger of the user as the user drags the finger across the screen until the he or she takes the finger off the screen, then for the line to remain there. I found a similar question on stack overflow at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22353969/drawing-straight-line-with-spritekit-and-uitouch-creates-multiple-lines">Drawing straight line with spritekit and UITouch creates multiple lines</a>, but it is written in Objective-C. And I don't think I understood the answer entirely to be honest. I'm using Xcode 7 and Swift 2.</p>  <pre><code>import SpriteKit  class GameScene: SKScene { override func didMoveToView(view: SKView) {  }  let path = CGPathCreateMutable()  override func touchesBegan(touches: Set&lt;UITouch&gt;, withEvent event: UIEvent?) {      let touch = touches.first      let position1 = touch!.locationInNode(self)      CGPathMoveToPoint(path, nil, position1.x, position1.y)  }  override func touchesMoved(touches: Set&lt;UITouch&gt;, withEvent event: UIEvent?) {      let touch = touches.first      let position2 = touch!.locationInNode(self)      CGPathAddLineToPoint(path, nil, position2.x, position2.y)     CGPathCloseSubpath(path)      let line = SKShapeNode()     line.path = path     line.strokeColor = UIColor.blackColor()     line.lineWidth = 5      self.addChild(line)  }  override func update(currentTime: CFTimeInterval) {     /* Called before each frame is rendered */ }  } </code></pre>  <p>Any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.</p>  <p>Ryan</p>
