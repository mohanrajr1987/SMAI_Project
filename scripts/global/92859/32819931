<p>I have a bunch of images in a folder name myImages.atlas. These images when put together will take up more than 2048x2048. Based on the Apple documentation I would have expected XCode to automatically break this up into multiple files. </p>  <pre><code>After an image has reached its maximum size, a new image is created. </code></pre>  <p>But when I try to compile it fails with the error:</p>  <pre><code>sprikekit texture atlas generator error cannot fit input texture into a maximum supported dimensions of 2048 x 2048 </code></pre>  <p>Does anyone know if it's possible for XCode to handle this sceanrio and if yes what might I be doing wrong?</p>
