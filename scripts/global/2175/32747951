<p>I am trying to connect to an Oracle DB using an ODBC connection manager in SSIS.  The ODBC DSN that I created works for MS Access, but when trying to create and configure a source task in SSIS, the following error message is displayed: </p>  <p>Test connection failed because of an error in initializing provider.  </p>  <blockquote>   <p>ERROR [IM003] Specified driver could not be loaded due to system error   1114; A dynamic link library (DLL) initialization routine failed.    (Oracle in instantclient_11_2,   C:\oralce\instantclient_11_2\SQORA32.dll).</p> </blockquote>  <p>Any suggestions?</p>
