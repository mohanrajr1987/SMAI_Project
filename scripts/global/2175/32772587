<p>I am trying to get the SQL Command as Variable in a SQL Datasource.</p>  <pre><code>"SELECT   " + (DT_WSTR, 25) @[User::valVariable] + " As Value from dbo.MyTable WHERE        (Key= " +  (DT_WSTR, 25)@[User::MyKey] + ")" </code></pre>  <p>This is a variable expression, and the value generated for this is :</p>  <pre><code>SELECT 1 As Value from dbo.MyTable WHERE (Key = 0) </code></pre>  <p>I want the Key value to be passed dynamically which can be set by a ?, however I am unable to do so. Is there any way to achieve it?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
