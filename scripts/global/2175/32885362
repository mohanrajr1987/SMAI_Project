<p>I am trying to upload a file to a remote sharepoint server using a c# script (from SSIS) and I am getting 401 unauthorized error. This is the method that I am using:   </p>  <pre><code>myWebClient = new WebClient(); LocalFileName = Dts.Variables["strTargetFile"].Value;  DestinationURL = "url";  myWebClient.Credentials = new NetworkCredential("user","password", "Domain"); myWebClient.Credentials = CredentialCache.DefaultNetworkCredentials;  Dts.Events.FireInformation(0, String.Empty, String.Format("Uploading {0} to {1}", LocalFileName, DestinationURL), String.Empty, 0, ref FireAgain);  myWebClient.UploadFile(DestinationURL, "PUT", LocalFileName.ToString()); </code></pre>  <p>I tryed to access and upload a file from a internet explorer and it worked perfectly. </p>
