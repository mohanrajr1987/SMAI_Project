<p>I have a SSIS package and I need to run Powershell to get some data. I used an Excute Process Task in SSIS and put C:\Windows\SysWOW64\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe in executable and it works perfectly. Now I want to set up a variable to get the work done. I created a variable and put the datatype strin and set the value as C:\Windows\SysWOW64\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe</p>  <p>Then  I went to expressions in the Executable Process task and make it 'executable' and put @[User::Powershell_Location] there. But I dont know what should I put in the Executable in process menu.</p>  <p>Any advise?</p>  <p>Thanks! </p>
