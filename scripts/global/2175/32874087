<p>I have a table with nearly 10 million records.  We are in dire need to perform a Type 2 data warehouse table and a slowly changing dimension to populate that table.  That is the easy part.</p>  <p>The hard part is, I want to understand how I can ONLY have the SSIS package look at the items where the items modified date is 72 hours or less than the current date; this would cause the package to run quickly the second time around.  I can have the Slowly Changing Dimension run off of a view that has this filter in it. BUT I do not want it to expire the records that were not in the last bunch of data. </p>  <p>Is there any tutorials hopefully including screen shots of what I can do to make this all happen smoothly?  I have searched and searched and have found nothing, but I am pretty sure that this is something very easy to do.</p>
