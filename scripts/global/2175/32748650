<p>This is the synopsis of what I need to do. I have a sourcefolder ex.Processed n multiple destination folders ex SSA, BVBV, HPQ n archive folders with the same subfolders(SSA, BVBV, HPQ). I have to move files from processed folder to these mutiple folders. Conditions when no file found, the ssis package , when 1 file found process n move the files to destination folder . When duplicate files found send email saying duplicate file found. The other thing is the folder names and file names r completely different. Suppose for SSA , filenames pertaining to that looks like this : 20150914083439_NETWORK. TXT BVBV: ConnectB2_340_20150730.txt . I am new to SSIS and using foreach loop container n script task for this. Neither am I familiar with C#. Any help would be grt!!! TiA</p>
