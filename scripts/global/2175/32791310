<p>I'm using <a href="https://sqlserverrider.wordpress.com/2013/01/07/dynamic-file-name-for-excel-connection-manager-ssis/" rel="nofollow">this ForEach loop tutorial</a> in an attempt to import all my Excel files from a folder to an SQL table via SSIS. I followed the steps exactly but can't get the Excel source block to recognize the variable filename. The error I get shows that the filepath did not work at all:</p>  <pre><code>Could not retrieve the table information for the connection manager ConnectionManagerName </code></pre>  <p>The source file formatting, type, and folder are consistent. Has anyone else had this problem? I suspect I'm missing something between steps 2-4 in the link, but I wouldn't know what it is.</p>
