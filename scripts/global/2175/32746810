<p>I need some help with creating an automated import job to import a flat file into SQL Server. These are the steps the job has to do: </p>  <ol> <li>truncate the destination table (in SQL Server) </li> <li>populate data (import the flat file .txt) to the destination table </li> <li>execute a stored procedure </li> <li>results export to Excel. </li> </ol>  <p>Now I can create an ssis package to do this and I did by </p>  <ol> <li>executing sql task to truncate the table </li> <li>inserting a data flow task </li> <li>bulk insert task </li> <li>execute sql task to execute the procedure </li> </ol>  <p>but the problem is the flat file source changes name everyday since it has the days date included example: <code>ClientResponse 2014-05-01 2200 step complete</code> also there are multiple files in the source it has to capture the most recent one. </p>  <p>Is creating an ssis package not going to work? I don't know any other way to automate this job and for it to capture the most recent <code>.txt</code> file in the source destination since the point was to not manually do this task everyday</p>
