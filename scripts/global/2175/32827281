<p>I am having trouble with a task in my SSIS 2012 package. I am creating a package to (in order):</p>  <ol> <li>truncate data in a SQL Server table</li> <li>populate that table via a flat text file  </li> <li>then executing a stored procedure</li> <li>then export the data to Excel</li> </ol>  <p>The table I am using is called <code>dbo.ClientData</code> in a database called <code>SalesQuota</code></p>  <p>The first two tasks work fine but I am having trouble with executing the stored procedure (via execute SQL task) in the package. I've tried everything from clicking retain same connection to true to trying to writing out the SQL Server procedure in the task. But I keep getting an error. So, I used SQL Search in Management Studio to see where the procedure is stored and it shows that it is in 3 different databases in the server could that be the reason for the error? I googled and saw something regarding mapping a variable (?) to the task but I couldn't find the parameters of the procedure.</p>  <p>This is the error I got</p>  <blockquote>   <p>[Execute SQL Task] Error: Executing the query "execute [dbo].[up_client_sp]" failed with the following error:<br>   Invalid object name 'SalesQuota.dbo.clientstatusgather'.<br>   Possible failure reasons: Problems with the query, "ResultSet" property not set correctly, parameters not set correctly, or connection not established correctly.</p> </blockquote>
