<p>I created a data flow task in SSIS. On double clicking, that task I added up ado.net source and destination. Under ado.net destination, I selected connection manager as odbc, and selected a user dsn.</p>  <p>Now, before doing all this stuff, I installed odbc driver from <a href="http://www.ch-werner.de/sqliteodbc/" rel="nofollow">ch-werner.de</a> and created a user dsn. In that process, I selected sqlite3 driver and my database is with the extension .sqlite.</p>  <p>Now, that dsn is available at ado.net destination. But when I select table it shows me this error that "The specified DSN contains an architecture mismatch".</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/0l4my.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/0l4my.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>To fix this stuff up, I researched some of the links. <a href="http://www.sqlabs.com/blog/2012/02/odbc-driver-on-windows-64bit-clarification/" rel="nofollow">One</a> was like, creating a 32-Bit data source names by running c:\windows\sysWOW64\odbcad32.exe. But, when I am trying to create a new dsn through that, it's not having SQLITE3 driver under create new datasource.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Nmytq.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Nmytq.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
