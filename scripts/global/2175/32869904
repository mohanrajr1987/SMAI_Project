<p>Im trying to execute a SQL Task after a For Loop Container completes (i.e performs its iterations) but it just wont execute.  I cant for the life of me work out why it wont execute as there are no errors.  Any ideas?</p>  <p><img src="http://imgur.com/klvlPUu.png" alt="SSIS Workflow"> <img src="http://imgur.com/IApzNP1.png" alt="Params"></p>  <p>The Loop executes the correct number of times but as you can see from the image, the Insert Referral Actions SQL Task does not execute.</p>  <p>The idea is that if the number of source records falls under a certain threshold e.g. 2000000 then just load in 1 shot otherwise loop 1000000 at a time and load.  This is to get around some network and connection issues I was having.</p>  <p>The final task (Insert Referral Actions) executes a stored procedure that joins the staging data with a lot of related tables and populates the Fact table.  It is this SQL Task that I need to share between the 2 branches.</p>  <p>Thanks for any help</p>
