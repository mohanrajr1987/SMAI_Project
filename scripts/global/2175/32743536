<p>I have a table that has frequent reads, inserts &amp; updates (it holds website users' session data).  It has a clustered index on a <code>varchar</code> field called <code>sessionID</code>. </p>  <p>I need to delete a bunch of records based on a list of <code>sessionID</code>s in another table. When I try to delete a large amount of them at a time, a lock is created that prevents the table from being written to and read from.  </p>  <p>If I delete them row by row using a foreach loop in an SSIS package, it seems to eliminate the locking.  </p>  <p>Are there any possible long-term negative effects to deleting row by row?</p>
