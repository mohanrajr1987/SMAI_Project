<p><strong>Is the "Use Proxy" option on an HTTP Connection in SSIS 2012 broken when not using credentials?</strong></p>  <p>I have a Web Service task in SSIS 2012 that works well normally.  When I modify its HTTP Connection to use a proxy without credentials, it seems to ignore my choice and not use the proxy at all.   When I specify credientials, it then uses the proxy. </p>  <p>To figure this out, I set it up both ways, and ran Fiddler <strong>with capture off</strong>.  Fiddler with capture off will still show traffic specifically routed through it as it acts as a proxy.</p>  <p>Below are the screenshots with details.  You should be able to reproduce this.</p>  <p>First, I note the port that Fiddler is set up with:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/NaJn0.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/NaJn0.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Then, I leave Fiddler running but <strong>not</strong> capturing:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8xbed.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8xbed.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Then I set up the HTTP connection to use the local Fiddler proxy explicitly:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/dzvRA.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/dzvRA.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Then I run the Web Service task, and note that nothing shows up in Fiddler.  </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/OPUSX.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/OPUSX.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>This tells me that, in this case, <strong>SSIS isn't actually using the Web Proxy as I asked it to.  Anyone know why not?</strong></p>  <p>To be sure it is working otherwise, I then set up the HTTP connection to use the local Fiddler proxy explicitly, but this time with credentials.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/GFz9x.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/GFz9x.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Then I run the Web service task, and note that the request now appears in Fiddler, as expected.  So what was wrong in the earlier example?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/gEMRE.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/gEMRE.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
