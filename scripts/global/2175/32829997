<p>I'm new to SSIS so please accept my apologies if this is a simple question.  I need to convert the date that is supplied in the report to a "period" that is used by our company.  The period format is YYYY-MM and the tricky part is the MM has to be 2 characters.  In other programs(excel, access, and even SQL) I can use an if then else statement to convert the month to 2 characters if it is between Jan and Sep.  I have tried several of the suggestions for if then else in SSIS I have found in various questions and they haven't worked.  This is what I currently have as my derived expression which isn't working.</p>  <pre><code>(DT_STR,7,1252)((Month[ReportDate]&lt;10)?(Year[ReportDate]+"-0"+Month[ReportDate]):(Year[ReportDate]+"-"+Month[ReportDate])) </code></pre>
