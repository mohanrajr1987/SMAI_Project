<p>We have a server which has SQL (specifically SSIS) but no Excel installed (and our policies prohibit this), however data from the SSIS needs to generate a formatted Excel file (with fixed images) and place this in an output directory.  </p>  <p>Is it possible to programmatically (using possibly .NET) to populate an Excel template file with values, and source data for charts, without Excel actually being installed on the computer?</p>
