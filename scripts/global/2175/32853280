<p>I wanted to create a SSIS catalog and the way to create a catalog is to right click on "Integration Services Catalogs" node and select "Create Catalog" option. </p>  <p>However, I am not able to see the "Integration Services Catalogs" node in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) as shown in the following image.</p>  <p>What is missing so that I can see this node in SSMS? Please help.</p>  <p>FYI, I have SQL Server 2014 (Developer edition) and Integration Services 12.0 installed on my machine.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/XntCw.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/XntCw.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
