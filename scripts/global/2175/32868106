<p>Before we start: Yes, I have to use 2005. No, I can't upgrade, it's not my decision.</p>  <p>I have an SSIS package that is suppsed to perform the following tasks: 1. Zip a text file using 7-zip 2. FTP the file to a specified site 3. Move the zipped file to an archive folder</p>  <p>Steps 1 and 2 work fine, but when it comes time to move the folder it fails. The error message says, "Could not find a part of the path '\Shares2\clntrial\DataMgt\C1460\DataTransfer\Data\Sent\TXT\archive\ABC701_XXX_2015-09-30.zip\ABC701_XXX_2015-09-30.zip'."  As you can see, it has the zip file name in the path twice.</p>  <p>That file destination path is set by a connection manager with the connection string populated by an expression that uses variables. When I edit the expression, it evaluates to the correct path with the file name appearing only once, that is, "\Shares2\clntrial\DataMgt\C1460\DataTransfer\Data\Sent\TXT\archive\ABC701_XXX_2015-09-30.zip". </p>  <p>Why is SSIS adding the file name a second time when the package runs?</p>
