<p>There are a number of views in a database on one of our servers. I need to save all the view definitions as text files in the following format:</p>  <pre><code>IF OBJECT_ID('&lt;[Schema_Name].[VIEW_NAME]&gt;') IS NOT NULL     DROP VIEW &lt;[Schema_Name].[VIEW_NAME]&gt; GO  &lt;&lt;View Definition Here&gt;&gt;  GO  GRANT SELECT ON &lt;[Schema_Name].[VIEW_NAME]&gt; TO [PUBLIC] GO </code></pre>  <p>The text file should be named as <strong>Schema_Name.VIEW_NAME.txt</strong></p>  <p>I don't want to do this manually as this would take up all my time. Any idea if this can be automated? Maybe using SSIS or something? </p>
