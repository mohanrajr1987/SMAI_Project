<p>I have an SSIS project which used to run correctly. But opening it this time, I was really surprised with this error message showing: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>"Error loading the name_package. The connection "" is not found !!! (It does not even give the connection's name). This error is thrown by Connections collection when the specific connection element is not found"</p> </blockquote>  <p>When I run the project it runs correctly but at the opening I have this error each time. I can't understand if it's OK or not. But this error is completely new!</p>  <p>I'm working with two different connection managers. I tried to create new ones and recompile. When closing and then reopening the project I get the same error once more. </p>  <p>What would cause this error and do I need to fix it?</p>
