<p>I am getting an error message in SSIS when trying to create a lookup transform.</p>  <p>OLD DB connection manager is defined. I am selecting to write a query:</p>  <pre><code>select      [No_] as a,      CASE isnumeric([name 2])      WHEN 1 THEN convert(int, [name 2])      ELSE -1     END as abcId  from      [Company Name$vendor] </code></pre>  <p>I get this error message: "Must specify valid information for parsing in the string"</p>  <p>If I click on preview I see the results that I want to use for the lookup, so the query is correct.</p>  <p>Any ideas?</p>
