<p>I am calling a SQL Server job from a stored procedure like below</p>  <pre><code>CREATE PROC StartMyMonthlyInventoryJob AS      EXEC msdb.dbo.sp_start_job N'_TIME_ACCESSABILITY_HOURS'        GO </code></pre>  <p>and I want to change the set values for this job (I know how to configure in graphical way). How do I pass parameters to set value when I call that job from a stored procedure? Thanks</p>
