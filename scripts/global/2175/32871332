<p>I'm new to SSIS (but I have experience with c# .NET, SSRS, TSQL, and so on). I was handed an old SSIS package and have successfully upgraded it to work in Visual Studio 2013, SQL Server 2014, with project deployment model. Next I want to use project level connection managers. I created a new one and changed all the connections in one of my packages to use it. Then I deleted the old (package level) connection manager and started getting this error: Error at SQL PostExecute to SSISPckgLog [Execute SQL Task]: Connection manager "oldConnection" does not exist. Can someone help me find where PostExecute is located. It is not visible on the Control Flow surface. If I can find it, I can change it so it will use my new project level connection manager. Thanks in advance! <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/XAaKE.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/XAaKE.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/pM7y3.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/pM7y3.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/94Hou.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/94Hou.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/DWDaj.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/DWDaj.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
