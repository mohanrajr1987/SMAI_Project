<p>I need to get the total transaction in the table and our formula involves a count distinct that's why I used derived column and aggregate transformation. </p>  <p>Now that I have the result, I want to add the output of aggregate transformation with another table. I tried union all, but it adds the output in the last entry.</p>  <p><strong>Example: Table1</strong></p>  <p>businessdate,storekey,itemkey,vf,trasnumber</p>  <p>1000,200,200,N,1234</p>  <p>1000,200,123,N,1235</p>  <p>1000,200,124,N,1235</p>  <p>1000,200,200,N,1236</p>  <p>1000,200,200,T,1236</p>  <p><strong>AggregateTable</strong></p>  <p>formula: (count distinct transnumber than have vf=n) subtract it with (count distinct transnumber that have vf=t)</p>  <p><strong>result</strong></p>  <p>4</p>  <p>I want the combined table to look like this:</p>  <p><strong>Table2</strong></p>  <p>businessdate,storekey,itemkey,vf,trasnumber,result</p>  <p>1000,200,200,N,1234,4</p>  <p>1000,200,123,N,1235,4</p>  <p>1000,200,124,N,1235,4</p>  <p>1000,200,200,N,1236,4</p>  <p>1000,200,200,T,1236,4</p>  <p>Would like to ask help on how I can add the result of aggregate transformation at the end of each row in table 1. </p>  <p>Thank you very much.</p>
