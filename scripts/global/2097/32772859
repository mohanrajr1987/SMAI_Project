<p>I am currently working on a project where I have created an Appointment superclass, with a Daily, Monthly, and Yearly subclass. I also created a Calendar class that has an ArrayList that contains Appointment objects that are dates. In the Calendar class I have an add(), remove(), and toString() methods. The problem I need advice on is the remove() method. In my tester class when I call upon remove() to remove a certain date, once it finds the date it removes everything in the ArrayList afterwards. How can I fix this so it only removes the particular date I want?</p>  <p>Here is my tester class:</p>  <pre><code>/**  * Demonstration of the Calendar and Appointment classes  */ public class AppointmentDemo {     public static void main(String[] args)      {         Calendar calendar = new Calendar();          calendar.add(new Daily(2000, 8, 13, "Brush your teeth."));         calendar.add(new Monthly(2003, 5, 20, "Visit grandma."));         calendar.add(new OneTime(2004, 11, 2, "Dentist appointment."));         calendar.add(new OneTime(2004, 10, 31, "Trick or Treat."));         calendar.add(new Monthly(2004, 11, 2, "Dentist appointment."));         calendar.add(new OneTime(2004, 11, 2, "Dentist appointment."));           System.out.println("Before removal of appointment: " + "\n" + calendar);         calendar.remove(2004, 11, 2);         //note that the daily appointment is removed because it occurs on         //11/2/2004 (as well as many other days).           System.out.println("After removal of 11/2/2004 " + "\n" + calendar);     } } </code></pre>  <p>This is my remove() method:</p>  <pre><code>public class Calendar  {     private ArrayList&lt;Appointment&gt; calendar = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();       public void remove(int year, int month, int day)     {            //iterate through ArrayList         for(Iterator&lt;Appointment&gt; i = calendar.iterator(); i.hasNext();)         {               Appointment date = i.next();              if(date.occursOn(year, month, day))             //if the element occurs on the input then remove that element             {                 i.remove();              }         }     } } </code></pre>  <p>My results:     </p>  <pre><code> Before removal of appointment:   [2000/8/13: Brush your teeth.,    2003/5/20: Visit grandma.,    2004/11/2: Dentist appointment.,    2004/10/31: Trick or Treat.,    2004/11/2: Dentist appointment.,    2004/11/2: Dentist appointment.]   After removal of 11/2/2004   [2000/8/13: Brush your teeth.,    2003/5/20: Visit grandma.] </code></pre>
