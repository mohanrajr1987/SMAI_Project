<p>I am having some difficulty grasping this concept. From this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8627373/what-data-structure-exactly-are-deques-in-c">thread</a> here it states</p>  <blockquote>   <p>A deque requires that any insertion to the front or back shall keep   any reference to a member element valid. It's OK for iterators to be   invalidated, but the members themselves must stay in the same place in   memory.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I was under the impression from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32793784/does-a-pointer-become-invalidated-if-an-iterator-is-invalidated-in-stl-container/32794121#32794121">this</a> thread which states</p>  <blockquote>   <p>A pointer is actually a type of iterator. In fact, for some container types, the corresponding iterator can be   implemented simply as a pointer.</p>      <p>If we have a pointer and an iterator that each reference the same   element of a container, then any operation that invalidates one will   invalidate the other.</p> </blockquote>  <p>so if an iterator becomes invalidated then references also become invalidated.  My question is how is that possible. If the iterator which points to a certain memory address becomes invalidated how can a reference to that address be valid ?</p>  <p><strong>Update:</strong></p>  <p>I understand that a deque is implemented by random chunks of memory and these chunks of memory are tracked by an independant data structure such as a dynamic array. However i am having difficulty understanding how an iterator could be invalid but a reference could be valid since essentially an iterator is a generalized pointer for the contents of the data structure. This makes me think that an iterator might be pointing to something else while a pointer points to the actual item ? Consider the following diagram of a vector .</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/vVU16.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/vVU16.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>From what i understand in the diagram above for a vector its that if content of a pointer changes the iterator also changes. How is that different for a deque . </p>
