<p>I was browsing SO looking at questions in Java, and I came across some interesting code.  Consider the following code:</p>  <pre><code>class A { public static void main(String[] args) {     int n = 13;     found: {         for (int x : new int[]{2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12})             if (n % x == 0) {                 System.out.println("" + n + " equals " + x + "*" + (n/x));                 break found;             }         System.out.println("" + n + " is a prime number");     } } </code></pre>  <p><code>}</code></p>  <p>Please keep in mind that I am no veteran in Java, and by no means a professional programmer (So please point anything that I am clearly missing). Now, I am curious as to what this line means:</p>  <pre><code>found: { </code></pre>  <p>My first observation was that it was setting a variable, but upon further examination, I realized that I was clearly not. So what is it doing? Is there a name for this in Java?</p>
