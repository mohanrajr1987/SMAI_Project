<p>I am trying to accomplish a rather simple task: I am reading in a csv file which contains an ID in column 0 and two texts associated with that ID in columns 2 and 3. I now want to form a list containing tuples of (ID, Text). Somehow, however, I cannot get this into a single list comprehension. Here's what I have so far:</p>  <pre><code>import csv  with open(filename) as csvfile:      reader = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=';')     next(reader)      rows = [(row[0], row[2]) for row in reader]          rows.extend([(row[0], row[3]) for row in reader]) </code></pre>  <p>The problem is that the <code>extend</code> does not work because <code>reader</code> has already been iterated through ... </p>  <p>Any suggestions on how I can do this in one single list comprehension?</p>
