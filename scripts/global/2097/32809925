<p>For a class of my own, I need to write an iterator class from scratch (without using std::iterator) (it will be a ContiguousIterator). I am searching for the list of required members and their signature, because I have no idea of all functions such an iterator should provide to be compliant with the standard library.</p>  <p>Where could I find an exhaustive list of these members and their signature?</p>
