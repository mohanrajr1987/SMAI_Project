<p>I have an Iterator[InputStream] which i map over to retrieve the individual results:</p>  <pre><code>val streams: Iterator[InputStream[CustomType]] = retrieveStreams() val results: Iterator[MyResultType] = streams flatMap (c =&gt; transformToResult(c)) </code></pre>  <p>This works as expected, meaning I can retrieve values of type MyResultType from the results iterator. The only problem I have is that the individual InputStreams are never being closed. Is there any way to do this?</p>
