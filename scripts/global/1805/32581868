<p>I come from a background of coding websites from scratch in raw php, html and so on in Windows text editors. I upload files to an server using FTP every time I want to see a change. I'm new to opensource.</p>  <p>Reading the documentation, Laravel seems to be geared towards installing Laravel and testing the apps you create on a home computer. I can't find any good information on how to use Laravel (or similar open source platforms) on an actual webserver that is online. Why is this? Am I missing something basic about how these sorts of open source projects work?</p>
