<p>I have the following code:</p>  <pre><code>setwd("C:/Users/Nicholas/Desktop/Answers") sessionsimpressions&lt;-read.csv('impressionsandsessions.csv') library(ggplot2) Error in loadNamespace(j &lt;- i[[1L]], c(lib.loc, .libPaths()), versionCheck =     vI[[j]]) :    there is no package called ‘Rcpp’ Error: package or namespace load failed for ‘ggplot2’ </code></pre>  <p>I tried .libPaths() and this is what came up:</p>  <pre><code>[1] "C:/Users/Nicholas/Documents/R/win-library/3.2" [2] "C:/Program Files/R/R-3.2.2/library"  </code></pre>  <p>I know it has to do something with my setup. I even uninstalled RStudio and R, that still didn't work. If anyone can help that would be great because currently I can't do any work with R. </p>  <p>I have looked at other solutions such as seeing if Rcpp is in both libraries but that didn't work. </p>  <p>Any help would be great, thanks!</p>
