<p>Today, on my MacBook Pro with OS X 10.10.3, I launched the App Store application and downloaded XCode 7. After the download has ended, I cannot find any update file on my disk. App Store says XCode 7 is installed, but indeed it's not. The XCode application on my disk is still the old version 6.4 and there is no trace of the XCode 7, nor an installer on my disk. I launched XCode 6.4 hopefully some upgrading should have been launched afterwards, but nothing happened. The About window confirms: it's the version 6.4 (6E35b). I turned off the machine and rebooted. Nothing changed. So I downloaded XCode 7 once again. Same trouble. Any idea? Solution?</p>
