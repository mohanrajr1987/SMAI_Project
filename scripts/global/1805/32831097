<p>I accidentally installed the Python Anaconda distribution in two different place: my home directory and my hard drive. Since I installed it on my hard drive first, the python packages were being installed there instead of in my home directory. I then deleted to the anaconda folder on my hard drive. But now when I try to run conda to install a package via my terminal, I get the following error.</p>  <pre><code>-bash: //anaconda/bin/conda: No such file or directory </code></pre>  <p>How would I switch it so that conda works and installs the packages in my home directory?</p>  <p>I did the command </p>  <pre><code>echo $PATH  </code></pre>  <p>and it gave me</p>  <pre><code>//anaconda/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin. </code></pre>  <p>Also, I did </p>  <pre><code>which -a conda </code></pre>  <p>and nothing showed up. I literally just bought a Macbook Air and am on Yosemite. </p>
