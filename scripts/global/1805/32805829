<p>I am developing an app which needs to act like a container of mini games. Each mini game is in its own apk. The app needs to be able to download the APK, and launch it, without having to install it first. Downloading the APK is solved, but my question is:</p>  <p>How to launch the APK without installing it first?</p>  <p>It doesn't have to be in the same process, the mini games just need to be launched.</p>  <p>There is a similar question <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17059752/how-to-run-external-downloaded-yet-not-installed-apps-on-android">here</a> but there doesn't seem to be a definitive answer. I know it is possible to <a href="http://blog.pentests.pl/2015/02/android-dynamic-activities.html" rel="nofollow">launch an activity from another APK</a> but there is no solution on loading the resources that inevitably accompany a game.</p>  <p>Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!</p>
