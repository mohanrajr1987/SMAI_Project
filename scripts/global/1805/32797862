<p>Ok, so first of all Im new here and im 14 so please cooperate with me :p</p>  <p>So what i wanna do is install android-x86 on my iball splendo pc stick, which had win 8.1 (uefi). Things i have tried so far-</p>  <p>1.Burn iso on flash drive, boot from it. Result- Boots, but only till the boot animation which is laggy, and pendrive gets unmounted. But boot animation continues infinitely.</p>  <p>2.Boot from usb, directly install android. Result- Says partition table is GPT so cannot install.</p>  <p>3.Booted into a windows 10 installation dvd, used diskpart to convert gpt tp mbr.  Result- Installed perfectly, but the same thing happened. Laggy bootanimation.</p>  <p>4.Tried installing lubuntu 15.04. Result- Now my device just doesnt want to boot up from usb. I select the flash drive, but it again boots up into android.</p>  <p>So please help me install android on my device. ANY method would do unless i can boot into and use android properly, but not VM please. </p>  <p>Thanks in advance :) </p>
