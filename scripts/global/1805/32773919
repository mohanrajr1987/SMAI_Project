<p>In my current work environment, we have a setup where we have a central server database, and that connects to a mobile app that has certain information sent to it and stored in a localized database, at least from what I understand. A family member mentioned a program he uses for member management and I was wondering if I could take a shot at building something similar, but I really have no idea how to build something from the ground up or get it deployed anywhere. </p>  <p>The main concern is that I don't know how to get a localized database set up and packaged into an installer. Heck I don't even know how to make an installer at ALL. Every answer I look up talks about needing to have a database server installed already, and I can't find any info on how it gets packaged in with applications. If the answer to that kind of thing is too long-winded I'm find with article links, I just need a place to get start. I'm most familiar with TSQL and C# but since this is all experimental, advice regarding applications of any language is appreciated. </p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
