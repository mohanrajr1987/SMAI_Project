<p>I have torch installed with prefix home/username/torch and am trying to run:</p>  <pre><code>luarocks install trepl </code></pre>  <p>Because I don't have sudo access to the cluster machine, I had to install readline (a dependancy of trepl) with prefix home/username/packages. I have added /home/username/packages/lib to my LD_LIBRARY_PATH, but I am running into an error that luarocks can't find readline.h (which is in packages/include)</p>  <p>Is there a way to specify an includepath to the luarocks install path</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
