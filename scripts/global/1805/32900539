<p>I have inherited a WPF application that uses MVVM Light 4.1. So I installed the 4.1 kit using the .msi file that was provided to me (so it's installed in the Program Files directory.) I am using Visual Studio 2015, so I want to install the newest MVVM Light so I can get the templates and snippets and learn the latest version. Can I install MVVM Light 5.2 while leaving 4.1 on my system? I don't even have any older versions of Visual Studio on my system right now, so I don't need the templates/snippets from version 4.1.</p>
