<p>I am trying to do some steps for finally being able to install "install_github("genomicsclass/ph525x") and I can't do it.</p>  <p>First I try to do the source for installing devtools, but when I install devtools some errors appear.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>source("<a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/biocLite.R" rel="nofollow">http://www.bioconductor.org/biocLite.R</a>")</p> </blockquote>  <p>Bioconductor version 3.1 (BiocInstaller 1.18.4), ?biocLite for help</p>  <blockquote>   <p>biocLite("devtools")</p> </blockquote>  <pre><code>[...]  configure: error: in `/tmp/RtmphuTUif/R.INSTALL25651c09ca1/git2r': configure: error:     ---------------------------------------------     OpenSSL library required       Please install:       libssl-dev (deb) or openssl-devel (rpm)    ---------------------------------------------  See `config.log' for more details ERROR: configuration failed for package ‘git2r’ * removing ‘/home/alicia/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.2/git2r’ ERROR: dependency ‘curl’ is not available for package ‘httr’ * removing ‘/home/alicia/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.2/httr’ ERROR: dependency ‘curl’ is not available for package ‘rversions’ * removing ‘/home/alicia/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.2/rversions’ ERROR: dependencies ‘httr’, ‘curl’, ‘rversions’, ‘git2r’ are not available for package ‘devtools’ * removing ‘/home/alicia/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.2/devtools’**  So, with all this I am not able to do the `library(devtools)`. </code></pre>  <p>Apart from this, I try to install the packages that appear in the error separately (curl, git2r, httr, rversions and devtools again) and I get the same errors than before.</p>  <p>For instance, the error that appear when I try to do <code>biocLite(“curl”)</code> is this:</p>  <pre><code>Warning messages: 1: In install.packages(pkgs = doing, lib = lib, ...) :   installation of package ‘curl’ had non-zero exit status 2: In install.packages(pkgs = doing, lib = lib, ...) :   installation of package ‘httr’ had non-zero exit status 3: In install.packages(update[instlib == l, "Package"], l, contriburl = contriburl,  :   installation of package ‘Biostrings’ had non-zero exit status 4: In install.packages(update[instlib == l, "Package"], l, contriburl = contriburl,  :   installation of package ‘limma’ had non-zero exit status 5: In install.packages(update[instlib == l, "Package"], l, contriburl = contriburl,  :   installation of package ‘XML’ had non-zero exit status 6: In install.packages(update[instlib == l, "Package"], l, contriburl = contriburl,  :   installation of package ‘annotate’ had non-zero exit status </code></pre>  <p>And I have limma, annotate and Biostrings packages installed correctly and with the <code>library()</code> done.</p>  <p>My version of R is 3.2.1 and I am starting to think that the versions are not compatible, as I do not understand why is this happening.</p>  <p>R version 3.2.1 (2015-06-18) -- "World-Famous Astronaut" Copyright (C) 2015 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit)</p>  <p>I would be very grateful if someone could help me, as I have search in some web pages and I do not find the answer.</p>  <p>Thank you,</p>  <p>A.</p>
