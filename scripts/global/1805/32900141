<p>On starting the El Capitan install from a running Yosemite OS an error dialog may appear complaining that there isn't enough free space on the startup disk to proceed. </p>  <p>After seeing this i erased some large files then tried again. This time the install continued to the point where, after reboot, it tried to proceed for about 30 minutes before it gave up. Once again it complained that there wasn't enough free disk space. Apparently it under-estimates the amount it needs on starting the install.</p>
