<p>I hope my problem is simple to resolve. I should to use mqtt protocol with my Raspberry Pi v2, so now I'm trying it with Paho libraries:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/paho/" rel="nofollow">http://www.eclipse.org/paho/</a></p>  <p>I use C++ language, so I wrote first these commands</p>  <pre><code>git clone http://git.eclipse.org/gitroot/paho/org.eclipse.paho.mqtt.c.git cd org.eclipse.paho.mqtt.c.git make sudo make install </code></pre>  <p>and then these</p>  <pre><code>git clone http://git.eclipse.org/gitroot/paho/org.eclipse.paho.mqtt.cpp.git cd org.eclipse.paho.mqtt.cpp.git make </code></pre>  <p>Now I have two questions:</p>  <ol> <li>What's the library that I have to include in my file? I'm trying to compile the example in the Paho's site <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/paho/clients/cpp/" rel="nofollow">https://www.eclipse.org/paho/clients/cpp/</a> but if I include the C library "MQTTClient.h" (in the C example) it doesn't recognize the classes, like <code>mqtt::client</code>. I have tried to include <code>client.h</code> (i found it in the documentation) but the compiler doesn't find it.</li> <li>Why the C++ procedure to start Paho's libraries doesn't install nothing? There is only the make command that creates library <code>lib/linmqttpp.so.0.1</code>. I must link it in the compile command? How?</li> </ol>
