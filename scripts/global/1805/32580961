<p>I'm planning a full rollout of Android Studio + SDK in one of our rooms. We have 20 clients on which I have installed Android Studio silent. When I first start Android Studio and go to the settings the path to the SDK directory is empty. The SDK is installed under <strong>C:*User*\Appdata\Local\Android</strong>. If I edit the path on every client it tooks to much time for me. I'm lazy :)</p>  <p>So anyone knows a solution how i can edit the path for example within a settings or .xml file?</p>  <p>Anyone out there who had the same problem or could understand me?</p>
