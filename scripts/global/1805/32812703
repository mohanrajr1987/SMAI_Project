<p>I'm trying to use luagraph, a binding to the graphviz library: <a href="http://luagraph.luaforge.net/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://luagraph.luaforge.net/index.html</a></p>  <p>To install, I'm using luarocks in Mac OS X. The following command is executed in bash:</p>  <pre><code>luarocks install luagraph </code></pre>  <p>The output is the following:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Installing <a href="https://luarocks.org/luagraph-1.0.4-1.src.rock" rel="nofollow">https://luarocks.org/luagraph-1.0.4-1.src.rock</a>...

Example: luarocks install luagraph   GRAPHVIZ_DIR=/usr/local</p> </blockquote>  <p>I have been installed graphviz using homebrew, but I can't figure out how to pass GRAPHVIZ_DIR or GRAPHVIZ_INCDIR properly.</p>  <p>How can I install luagraph?</p>
