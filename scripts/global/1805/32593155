<p>I recently installed psycopg2 to my computer using macport. I followed the instructions on the Psycopg2 website: </p>  <pre><code>sudo port install py27-psycopg2 </code></pre>  <p>When I used </p>  <pre><code>port install  </code></pre>  <p>, psycopg2 was listed as successfully installed by macport.</p>  <p>However, whenever I type </p>  <pre><code>import psycopg2 </code></pre>  <p>in python, it also give me the errors that there is no such modules in python. I am a novice in computer science. I looked up some questions kind of remsemble mine, but I could figure out what is going on. I hope everyone can help me out with this. I really appreciate your help and your time. </p>
