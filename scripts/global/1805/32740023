<p>I was installing rhive on my cluster. I followed below link for installation.</p>  <p><a href="https://github.com/nexr/RHive" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/nexr/RHive</a></p>  <p>Everything went smooth except last line. When i tried to connect r with hive server , it is throwing below error.</p>  <pre><code>&gt; library(RHive) Loading required package: rJava Loading required package: Rserve &gt; rhive.init() &gt; rhive.env()         hadoop home: /usr/lib/hadoop         hadoop conf: /usr/lib/hadoop/conf         hive home: /usr/lib/hive&gt; &gt; &gt; rhive.connect() Error: class not found &gt; </code></pre>  <p>Any pointers here?</p>
