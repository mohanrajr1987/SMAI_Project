<p>I work at a company, we install software through special installer. These software have already all kind of updates and also the license merged into it. The problem with it, it only install the software for one computer at a time, we cannot install for multiple computers at once. I copied the files from the installer of one software (Adobe Acrobat Pro), and I got:</p>  <p><code>enter code here</code>AcrobatSecUpd.msp <code>enter code here</code>AcrobatUpd.msp <code>enter code here</code>AcroPro.msi <code>enter code here</code>Setup.exe <code>enter code here</code>setup.ini <code>enter code here</code>AdobeAcrobat-11 Pro-Corp-EN.exe</p>  <p>and some other files.  when I run the special installed, I only see in the log that its using this file: AdobeAcrobat-11 Pro-Corp-EN.exe</p>  <p>What I do is, I just call the above exe from shared location on the netwrok in cmd, and it installs it but the problem without it being activated.</p>  <p>I don't know what the problem is?</p>
