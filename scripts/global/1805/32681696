<p>I am new to android development. I generated the signed apk successfully.It is getting installed in android higher versions successfully.  But when I am trying to install in the android kitkat version, it's getting failed without any error message, once we click on the "install" button.  App is successfully getting installed when tried using adb via command prompt, installation with debugging is also working fine.  "Direct apk installation is failing in Kitkat" Please help</p>
