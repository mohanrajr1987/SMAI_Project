<p>I'm starting a Udemy class on beginner PHP &amp; MYSQL, and I am attempting to install the current version of MAMP for the first time on my macbook pro running OS X El Capitan version 10.11.  I have no previous versions of MAMP installed.  During the installation process, the install fails and present a message: "Please quit MAMP/MAMP PRO and all servers and deactivate the dynamic DNS services before you restart the install process."  I have no idea how to proceed.  Can't anyone offer some guidance on the steps to follow to resolve this problem?</p>
