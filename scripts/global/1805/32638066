<p>I tried all the methods that I can find online and I even dove into the python code it didn't help. </p>  <p>I am using windows 7 64 bit version. I have installed Microsoft VS 2008 and 2012 both. The Python I installed is 3.5</p>  <p>When I run pip install numpy, I am getting error: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Unable to find vcvarsall.bat</p> </blockquote>  <p>The version return by the code in <code>msvc9compiler.py</code> shows my VS version is 14.0 and I dive into all kinds of windows registry to add a couple of entries(VC and ProdctDir to point to the VS 2008 VC folder). It didn't help. I can run <code>vcvarsall.bat</code> from the command line and it runs fine with following result. Setting environment for using Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 x86 tools.</p>  <p>I though it works fine.</p>  <p>Is there anything else I can try?  I have spent two days on this.</p>
