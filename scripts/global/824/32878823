<p>Following the two great questions about programming books: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/388242/the-definitive-c-book-guide-and-list">The Definitive C++ Book Guide and List</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/562303/the-definitive-c-book-guide-and-list">The Definitive C Book Guide and List</a> I'd like to propose creating such list for <strong>Assembly Language</strong>.</p>  <p>This might be an old and not so popular language nowadays, but I believe that good knowledge of it can only help in software development using higher level languages.</p>  <p>Please provide <strong>quality</strong> books and an approximate skill level. Because each processor have some number of their own specific instructions please <strong>no reference manuals</strong> - if someone will need one then it is easy to find it.</p>
