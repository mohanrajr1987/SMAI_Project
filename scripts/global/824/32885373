<p>So I have to do this project for school that consists of reading a file in brainfuck and interpret it as assembly. The code works if I save the file path as a String inside the .data section, but what I want to have it so it gets the file path as an argument when starting the code in the terminal.</p>  <p>I have tried popping 3 times(since the stack should be number of args/ addres of program/ first arg), and then setting %rdi to the value at the adress of the 3rd popped item, but it returns "./interpreter" instead of the file path</p>  <p>This is the code that works:</p>  <pre><code>.data filePath: .asciz "brainF.b" fileRead: .asicz "r"  .text .global main main:     call fileReader #moves filePath to %rdi, fileRead to %rsi, calls fopen and reads the file     #code that grabs the read string and interprets it </code></pre>  <p>but what I want is:</p>  <pre><code>.data fileRead: .asciz "r"  .text .global main main:     #get 1st argument from terminal(file path) and store it in %rdi     call fileReader #moves fileRead to %rsi, calls fopen and reads the file </code></pre>  <p>and here's how I have to compile and link(this part can't be changed, that's how my teacher wants me to do it):</p>  <pre><code>gcc -o interpreter interpreter.s ./interpreter brainF.b </code></pre>
