<p>I got an assignment from university to calculate fibonacci series of 10 elements when we know the first 2 elements. I have been trying to do this in the past hours but I got lost on the way.</p>  <p>This is my code:</p>  <pre><code>IDEAL MODEL small STACK 100h DATASEG  Fiburnachi db 0, 1, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ? TenTimes db 8   CODESEG  start:     mov ax, @data     mov ds, ax     xor ax, ax     xor bx, bx     xor cx, cx       mov cl, [TenTimes]     lea bx, [Fiburnachi]     FibLoop:         mov al, [bx]       //This is my first attempt.         add al, [bx+1]     //i have tried using only the "ax" register,         inc [bx]           //i can't seem the find the correct way to         mov [bx], al       //store the value I have in al (last result)          mov al, [bx]       //This Doesn't work I dunno why really.         mov dl, [bx+1]         add al, dl         mov [bx+1], al         inc [bx]      FibLoop </code></pre>  <p>I think that my understanding of correct looping and assigning through array indexes is wrong.</p>  <p>What is the correct way of doing this? Will I have to use 2 registers for the Calculation itself? </p>
