<p>What I'm trying to do is basically make a loop in AVR studio4 which writes hex numbers from 0 to 4F into consecutive memory locations. I'm using r16 to write the values and then store those values to memory and that just keeps going. Here's what I have so far:</p>  <pre><code>.cseg LDI r16, 0x00 ;Initialize the first value st x, r16  loop: inc r16 ;increments the counter by 1 st x, r16 ;stores the data into a memory location brne loop   done: jmp done   .dseg .org 200  .db 0x50 ;reserves 50 bits of storage in memory </code></pre>  <p>So what else do I have to do to make this work? </p>
