<p>Currently I'm learning assembly, and I'm using a86 macro assembler, Oracle VM VirtualBox. I'm wondering why do we declare or put variables in such way (after jump command)? If I declare or put the variables before jump command the program will become error. Is there any explanation behind such structure? Thank you.</p>  <pre><code>seg1 segment    org 100h    jump start    ; variables here (comment)    start:     mov ah, 4ch    int 21h seg1 ends </code></pre>
