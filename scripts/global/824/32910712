<p>Since few weeks, I have been studying Assembly Language Programming, today I installed all the necessary applications to compile an assembly program. </p>  <p>I install DOSBox 0.74, NASM (Assembler), and AFD (Debugger). I mount the drive and see my .asm files correctly. But when I execute the following command:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>nasm firstprogram.asm -o firstprogram.com</p> </blockquote>  <p>it gives me the following error: <code>This program cannot be run in dos mode</code></p>  <p>But when I compile the file through command prompt (cmd) it compiles corrrectly and then I have to go to DOSBox to run AFD and debug the .com file. </p>  <p>Any idea why am I getting this error on DOSBox?</p>
