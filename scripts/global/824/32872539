<p>Basic question here,</p>  <p>I wrote the following block:</p>  <pre><code>    IDEAL     MODEL small     STACK 100h     DATASEG      Var1 db 4     Var2 db 2      CODESEG  start:     mov ax, @data     mov ds, ax     xor ax, ax     mov al, [Var1]     cmp al, [Var2]     jg  Var1Greater     mov ax, 1 Var1Greater:     mov ax, 0 </code></pre>  <p>I'm new to assembly.</p>  <p>I wanted to create a code that compares [Var1] to [Var2].</p>  <p>IF(!) [Var1] is greater than [Var2], execute <code>mov ax, 1</code>. IF(1) anything else(equal or less) excecute, <code>mov ax, 0</code>.</p>  <p>How can this be done? the code I wrote executes both instructions if the condition is true.</p>
