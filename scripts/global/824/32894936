<p>I am experimenting with a simple kernel, and I am pretty blank on this area.  Can I program the PIC and change interrupt service routines from inside a Windows program? (I need to test the code on SOME platform)</p>  <p>And if yes, is using "out " instructions with absolute port addresses valid in protected mode? Might be a stupid question, but I recall that I could NOT "out" to the parallel port without a kernel mode DLL. Is this different for the address of the PIC?</p>  <p>Thank you in advance</p>
