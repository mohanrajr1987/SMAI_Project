<p>I have a hexadecimal address that I want to encode into a raw string. I am following a tutorial on buffer overflow attack and this string will encode my attack string and return address. The problem is this: Whenever I encode hex value <code>0x8877a377</code> into string and read it into my executable, when I check the return address using gdb, I always see and extra literal next to a3. My address looks like this in gdb </p>  <pre><code>0x77a3c277  0x00000088 </code></pre>  <p>The extra c2 appears from somewhere and I have absolutely no clue why my encoded string decodes to this. i am using <a href="http://codebeautify.org/hex-string-converter" rel="nofollow">this</a> to encode. I have tried other encoders but with same result. What's wrong here? </p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong> So I checked string without <code>a3</code> and I think it's <code>a3</code> that's creating problem. How should I encode <code>a3</code>?</p>
