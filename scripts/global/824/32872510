<p>I have a char array composed of elements 5 3. The array is used to represent number 53. What should be the approach to convert this number of three chars to its binary equivalent? I am implementing this in C, later on it will need to be rewritten in assembly. The solution I seek should be purely low stuff work without any helper libraries.</p>  <p>I am basically stuck with an idea to convert separately 5 and 4 (via mapping 5 and 4 to their ascii equivalents). Yet the idea would not work for sure. I have another idea to convert char '5' to int 5 by right shifting the byte by 4. Same with 4. Then multiply 5 by 10 and add 4, and then use division by two algorithm to find remainder and compose the binary number.</p>
