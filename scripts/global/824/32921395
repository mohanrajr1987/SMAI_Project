<p>I am trying not to explode a bomb, From the screenshot, i have jumped the first explosion, now i have disassembled cmpl at x008048c14, the next instruction is ja which calls the explosion, which am trying to escape.  So, what i understand is "cmpl $0x7, 0x1c(%esp)" subtracts 7 from 0x1c(%esp) then it sets up the flags, if ja is set then it explodes.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/YCaCb.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/YCaCb.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I tried to get information from the register by command "i r" and this is what i got, I'm trying to get what value is from 0x1c(%esp), i can't do "x/d 0xffffd000" How can i go about this? <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/N0TrT.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/N0TrT.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
