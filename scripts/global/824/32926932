<p>I am trying to implement a print function in an external file given this code:</p>  <pre><code>[ org 0x7c00 ]  mov bx , HELLO_MSG call print_string  mov bx , GOODBYE_MSG call print_string  jmp $  %include "print_string.asm"  HELLO_MSG: db "Hello , World !" , 0 ;  GOODBYE_MSG: db "Goodbye !", 0  times 510 -( $ - $$ ) db 0 dw 0xaa55 </code></pre>  <p>The function I wrote looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>print_string : pusha mov ax, bx mov ah , 0x0e int 0x10 popa ret </code></pre>  <p>But it doesn't work. I guess it's because I am using the wrong registers... but I am a little confused, because in previous examples in the tutorial, the character to be printed is first moved to <code>al</code> and in the print function only this is used:</p>  <pre><code>mov ah , 0x0e int 0x10 ret </code></pre>  <p>But since here, <code>bx</code> is used, I can't just print what's in <code>al</code>, right?</p>  <p>Some help would be highly appreciated!!</p>
