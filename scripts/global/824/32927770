<p>I am a newbie to Assembly and C bit-manipulation. I have little knowledge about C programming, but don't know anything about bit manipulation. I have questions in my assignments and I did not find the appropriate answer on the web.</p>  <p>Please help me to find the answers to this questions are:</p>  <p>Q1: Write a small piece of code for any real time application addressing PORTB as input port and PORTD as output port. Compute the instruction delay of the program as well assuming 9MHz as crystal frequency.</p>  <p>Q2(a): Write a small piece of code utilizing the DECFSZ command in Assembly.<br> Q2(b): Transform the assembly code of part(a) in C language using C operation, decision structure and loops.</p>  <p>My friend suggested me following answer for Q2(a), If following code is correct, please transform the code in C language.</p>  <pre><code>list p=18F4520    ;FINE ORG 0x0000 COUNT EQU 0x40 COUNT6 EQU 0x96     MOVLW d'49'     MOVWF COUNT     MOVWF 0 AGAIN ADDLW 66     DECFSZ COUNT, F     GOTO AGAIN         MOVWF COUNT6 end </code></pre>
