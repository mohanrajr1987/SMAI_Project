<p>I'm trying to write a program that get a String that contains number, and put in Sum2 variable the sum of the digits of the number that the function got. this is what I wrote but It doesn't work and I don't know why:</p>  <pre><code>.386  .MODEL Flat, STDCALL  option casemap:none   SomeFunc proto :DWORD  include \masm32\include\windows.inc include \masm32\include\msvcrt.inc includelib \masm32\lib\msvcrt.lib  .data      Sum2 dd ?     stop db 0     fmt db '%s',0  .code  SomeFunc proc Number:DWORD     Lop:         mov eax,Number         mov ebx,'10'         xor edx,edx         div ebx         add Sum2,edx         mov Number,eax         cmp Number,0         jna Lop     ret SomeFunc endp  start:     invoke SomeFunc,'123'     invoke crt_printf,offset Sum2,offset fmt end start </code></pre>  <p>I really don't understand why it doesn't work and how do I make it work. can someone explain me? Sorry for my bad english. thanks for the help.</p>
