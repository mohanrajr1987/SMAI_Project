<p>I got stuck while trying to solve this question (tried to solve it by pointers to the strings) how can I solve this question in assembly:</p>  <p>I have two strings- a and b. I have to compare these strings and print 't' if they equal and 'f' if they dont. the compare has some rules:</p>  <p>if string b has '+', this sign can be any char(even empty string), if string b has '-', this sign can be any string (even empty string). </p>  <p>how can I solve this question? </p>  <p>thank you</p>
