<p>I'm trying to understand OMF file structure using objconv, I have this file:</p>  <pre><code>    Segment records:       Segment  1, Name _TEXT, Class CODE, Align 1, Public, 16 bit, Length 871        Overlay 1     ....       Segment  4, Name _DATA, Class DATA, Align 16, Public, 16 bit, Length 110     Overlay 1     ...     LEDATA, LIDATA, COMDAT and FIXUPP records:          LEDATA: segment _TEXT, Offset 0x100, Size 0x263 //includes fixupp          LEDATA: segment _TEXT, Offset 0x365, Size 0x2          LEDATA: segment _DATA, Offset 0x0, Size 0x6E //includes fixupp </code></pre>  <p>I'm intrested in the _TEXT segment, there are two LEDATA records of _TEXT segment but none of them starts from Offset 0x0, If that so, what data is located between Offset 0x0 and 0x100?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
