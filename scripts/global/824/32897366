<p>I'm taking my first assembly class and I'm a little unsure of how to write to consecutive memory locations. </p>  <p>EDIT:  I looked at the AVR Assembler instructions and came up with the following:</p>  <pre><code>.cseg   ; current segment is code .org 0  ; begin assembling at memory address 0      clr r27     ldi r26, $60     ldi r16, 0x00   ; set initial loop counter to 0  lp:                     ; on each iteration         st X+, r16      ; load current number from 0x00-0x0F into memory (increment X)         inc r16         ; increment r16         cpi r16, 0x10   ; compare current value of r16 to max value         breq done       ; done if max value reached         rjmp lp         ; otherwise loop again  done: jmp done </code></pre>  <p>Am I using X correctly?</p>
