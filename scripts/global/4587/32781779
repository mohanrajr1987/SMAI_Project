<p>I am working on a single machine Cloudera Sandbox instance and I am trying to produce a output file for each Reducer output. I know that it was possible to do that in old API using <code>MultipleTextOutputFormat</code> class, however it does not work anymore. I also do not want to have drop Reduce phase. </p>  <p>I attach an image displaying my issue<a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/mokwf.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/mokwf.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
