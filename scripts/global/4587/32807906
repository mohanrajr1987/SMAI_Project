<p>I have extended the <code>InputSplit</code> class of Hadoop to calculate my custom input split, however while am returning a particular HostIP(i.e datanode IP) as string for the overridden <strong>getLocations()</strong>, the Map Task for it is not being executed on that HostIP instead its executing on some other.What would be the issue for not executing on that particular HostIP?</p>
