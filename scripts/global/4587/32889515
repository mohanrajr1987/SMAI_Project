<p>I'm running hadoop on mesos, and I'm unsure how to configure memory for mesos.  Specifically, a parameter like mapred.mesos.slot.mem (from <a href="https://github.com/mesos/hadoop/blob/master/configuration.md" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/mesos/hadoop/blob/master/configuration.md</a>) would get configured in what file?  </p>  <p>I know that other parameters in the configuration.md file can be placed in hadoop's mapred-site.xml file, but I don't know where to put other mesos configuration parameters.  Any help would be appreciated.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
