<p>In the input file which I need to process have data classified by headers and its respective records. My 200 MB file has 3 such headers and its records split across 4 blocks(3*64 MB and 1*8 MB).</p>  <p>The data would be in below format</p>  <pre><code>HEADER 1 Record 1 Record 2 . . Record n HEADER 2 Record 1 Record 2 . . Record n HEADER 3 Record 1 Record 2 . . Record n </code></pre>  <p>All I need is to take the <strong>HEADER</strong> as a key and its below <strong>Records</strong> as values and process some operations in my mapper code.</p>  <p>The problem over here is my Records are split across different blocks. For suppose  my first Header and its respective Records occupy a space of 70 MB, it means it occupies 64 MB of the first block and 6 MB of space in 2nd block. </p>  <p>Now how does the mapper that runs on 2nd block knows that 6 MB of file belongs to records of the HEADER 1.</p>  <p>Can any one please explain me as how to get the Header and its records completely.</p>
