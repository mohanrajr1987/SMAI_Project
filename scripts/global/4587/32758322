<p>I have to do certain operations on my input data and write it to hdfs using mapreduce program. My input data looks like </p>  <pre><code>abc   some data   some data   some data   def   other data   other data   other data  </code></pre>  <p>and continues in the same way, where <code>abc</code> ,<code>def</code> are the headers and <code>some data</code> are records with tab space.</p>  <p>My task is to eliminate the headers and append it to its below records like</p>  <pre><code>some data abc   some data abc   some data abc   other data def   other data def   other data def   </code></pre>  <p>Each header will have 50 records. </p>  <p>I am using the default record reader so it reads each line at a time</p>  <p>Now my problem is how do I know that map function has been called for a nth time? Do I have any counter to know that? So that I can use that counter to append the header to string as</p>  <pre><code>if (counter % 50 ==0 )    *some code* </code></pre>  <p>Or else static variables are the only way?</p>
