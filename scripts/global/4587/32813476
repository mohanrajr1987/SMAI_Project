<p>I am trying to implement simple workflow using MapReduce Java API (not using Oozie) where I try to chain multiple MapReduce jobs. However, it seems that program is not waiting until the one job is finished to start the other. Here's my stripped-down job configuration class. Am I doing something incorrect?</p>  <pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {     int currentIteration = 0;     int roundCount;      Configuration conf = createConfiguration(currentIteration);     Job job = new Job(conf, "test");      double roundLog = Math.log(getRoundCount(conf));     double log2 = Math.log(MRConstants.mergeFactorValue);      roundCount = (int) Math.floor(roundLog / log2);      job.waitForCompletion(true);      for (int i = currentIteration; i &lt; roundCount; i++){         Configuration newConf = createConfiguration(currentIteration);         Job newJob = new Job(newConf, "test");          newJob.waitForCompletion(true);     } } </code></pre>
