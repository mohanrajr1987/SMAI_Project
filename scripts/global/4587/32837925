<p>I have a master node in Hadoop cluster. It can or cannot be also worker node. How can I get info about the CPU/Memory usage of master node for coordinating other nodes and the one for its own worker node usage? For example, 40% of memory or CPU is used for its master node tasks (coordination of other worker nodes), 30% memory used for worker node tasks (the worker node inside the master node machine). Is there a way to know this?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
