<p>After running the map reduce job of a word-count example I could see four folders at hadoop/logs/userlogs/job_id_1/.These folders are named as 1.attempt_id_0001_r_000000_0  2.attempt_id_0001_m_000002_0 3.attempt_id_0001_m_000001_0 4.attempt_id_0001_m_000000_0. I have seen max number of task attempts are four by default.But here three attempt folders are of map tasks and another one is of reducer.I have given 'System.out.print' statements in mapper and reducer files as well but I could see the logs in stdout folder of only 'attempt_id_0001_m_000000_0' and 'attempt_id_0001_r_000000_0' but I cant see any stdout content in 'attempt_id_0001_m_000001_0' and 'attempt_id_0001_m_000002_0' except some syslog contents. I would like to know which field decides the number of attempt folders in logs? and Whether we can change number of map and reduce tasks?</p>  <p>Thank you </p>
