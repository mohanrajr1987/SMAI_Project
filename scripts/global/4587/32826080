<p>I am reading through and trying to complete this tutorial on Apache's website:</p>  <p><a href="https://pig.apache.org/docs/r0.7.0/tutorial.html#Pig+Installation" rel="nofollow">https://pig.apache.org/docs/r0.7.0/tutorial.html#Pig+Installation</a></p>  <p>I don't find any <code>pig.jar</code> in the pig-0.15.0 folder that I have unpacked. However, I do find <code>pig-0.15.0-core-h1.jar</code> and <code>pig-0.15.0-core-h2.jar</code>.</p>  <p>I wonder if this tutorial is outdated. What should I do?</p>
