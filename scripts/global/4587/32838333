<p>Does Hadoop process replicas also? For example worker node <code>i</code>, in <code>mapper</code> phase, processes the data stored on that machine only. After data (not replica, but original) is finished to be processed in <code>mapper</code> phase or maybe not finished, can there be a case that, machine <code>i</code> processes replica data stored on that machine? Or replica is used only when some node does off?</p>
