<p>I'm struggling to understand how JMeter summariser works:</p>  <pre><code>03:06:30 [debug] summary =  73930 in  1523s =   48.5/s Avg:   174 Min:     9 Max: 33133 Err:     4 (0.01%) 03:07:01 [debug] summary +   1573 in  78.2s =   20.1/s Avg:   142 Min:    10 Max:  2428 Err:     1 (0.06%) Active: 1600 Started: 1600 Finished: 0 03:07:01 [debug] summary =  75503 in  1555s =   48.6/s Avg:   173 Min:     9 Max: 33133 Err:     5 (0.01%) 03:07:30 [debug] summary +   1538 in  82.3s =   18.7/s Avg:   118 Min:    10 Max:  2704 Err:     0 (0.00%) Active: 1600 Started: 1600 Finished: 0 03:07:30 [debug] summary =  77041 in  1583s =   48.7/s Avg:   172 Min:     9 Max: 33133 Err:     5 (0.01%) </code></pre>  <p>I have 73930 transactions executed in 1523s, which gives average of 48.5/s. Then two bunches of transactions are added on top of that:</p>  <p>1573 in  78.2s =   20.1/s 1538 in  82.3s =   18.7/s</p>  <p>Note the averages - 20.1/s and 18.7/s are below initial 48.5/s. I'd expect those to decrease overall statistics, but it goes up instead, by 0.2/s:</p>  <p>77041 in  1583s =   48.7/s</p>  <p>What I can see is: transactions are added as I'd expect (e.g. 73930 + 1573 = 75503), but how 1523s become 1555s and then 1583 is not clear to me.</p>  <p>Can someone explain that to me?</p>
