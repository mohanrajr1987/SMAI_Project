<p>I'm using JMeter to test concurrent downloads, and need to store it into specific folder. </p>  <p>I'm working on windows and using "Save response to a file". If I use the absolute path it all works exactly as I want it to work.</p>  <p>Now, I need to share this with a group (will be stored in repo) and want to change my obviously wrong absolute path to relative.</p>  <p>Now: "~" - stores download in project root folder, where .JMX file is, but I want it in: "~/downloads/" so, in subfolder.</p>  <p>None of "regular" things work and yes I tried all possible combinations even those I know it should not work at all.  ~/downloads/ ./downloads/ ~./downloads/ \downloads\ \downloads\ ...</p>  <p>It or fails, and I can see in log error like: ~\downloads\1.x-gzip (The system cannot find the path specified)</p>  <p>Or It get's store in root with the filename "downloads" instead 1.x-gzip</p>  <p>Is there a way to do it, maybe using beanshell? </p>  <p>Most important, why is that behavior in JMeter so different, I mean if it works for "home" and "~/../" why it does not recognize subfolders? </p>  <p>Thanks</p>
