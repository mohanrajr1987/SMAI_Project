<p>I am currently trying to setup a load test that consists of 5 http requests. </p>  <pre><code>1. POST to http://example.com/Confirm </code></pre>  <p>This is the initial request where i send out the data, the response contains two hashes that i need to store for later use. </p>  <pre><code>2. GET to http://example.com/Verify/${hash} 3. POST to http://example.com/Final/${hash} </code></pre>  <p>In the final part, i have to post hash value from the 1st request to the url together with some other response data. I have tried using XPath extractor, though i get the following error no matter what i try:</p>  <pre><code>ERROR - jmeter.util.XPathUtil: Type=Val=false Tol=false org.xml.sax.SAXParseException; lineNumber: 12; columnNumber: 58; The string "--" is not permitted within comments. jmeter.extractor.XPathExtractor: SAXException while processing (//Response[1]/WI_HASH) The string "--" is not permitted within comments.  </code></pre>  <p>Are there any other options for response parsing apart from the XPath/Regexp extractor?</p>
