<p>I am running a test with jmeter on osx against a server cluster. Now I am wondering how to interpret the test results taken with "graph result". </p>  <p>This is an example output running 50 threads on a macbook pro 2015:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/3SOYA.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/3SOYA.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>It states 2,090.949/minute throughput. Is this 2M requests per minute? That would equal 33K/s ?! The y-Axis indicates ms, is this latency or time for each request? What do the numbers Average, Median etc. indicate, are those ms per request?</p>  <p>Thank you for any help on this.</p>
