<p>I am new to JMeter and we are using it to develop a test plan for our Node/Express server. I added two HTTP requests: one to add a user, and one to delete that user. The first request (add user) goes through fine, but the second request is failing. The reason it is failing appears to be that JMeter is setting two Content-Length headers onto the request - one is correct and the other is not. The server logs show this error:</p>  <pre><code>{ [Error: request size did not match content length] type: 'request.size.invalid', message: 'request size did not match content length', statusCode: 400, status: 400, received: 2, expected: 1299, length: 1299 } </code></pre>  <p>In the View Results Tree, I see that the second request has the following headers:</p>  <pre><code>Request Headers: Connection: keep-alive Content-Type: application/json Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8 Date: Wed, 30 Sep 2015 18:50:17 GMT Vary: Accept-Encoding X-Powered-By: Express Content-Length: 1299 Connection: Content-Length: 2 User-Agent: Apache-HttpClient/4.2.6 (java 1.5) </code></pre>  <p>As you can see, JMeter is setting two <code>Content-Length</code> headers and I cannot figure out why (it should be <code>2</code> - not sure where the <code>1299</code> is coming from). (Also I just noticed it's setting two <code>Content-Type</code> headers as well, not sure if that is related.)</p>  <p>I have googled this issue and cannot seem to find any answers. If anyone has any tips or suggestions, it would be appreciated. I am attaching screenshots of JMeter for reference (sensitive information removed).
