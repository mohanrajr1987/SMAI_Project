<p>i have two CSV files which i need to loop through. I am using jp@gc - Variables from CSV file. The contents are:</p>  <p>File #1</p>  <pre><code>File successfuly parsed, 10 variables found: ${1} = e79d29ec-f356-4682-b601-fa6b41c1b40a ${2} = b0c4c235-60c4-462b-bab4-89e65da8e00c .......... </code></pre>  <p>File #2</p>  <pre><code>File successfuly parsed, 10 variables found: ${0} = 88F6470E3E45921AEC8240A4A1C837F323C96E5DB8D06F959A42CE068E5D6477 ${1} = 2A2EE03FA798D359963C47F6DB97194BB2F6E053489DBE1539367697679E2D5E </code></pre>  <p>I have a couple of of HTTP requests which will use these values, for each run every request has to take a new value from the CSV file. I have tried using the logic controllers with no luck. Anyone who had success with something similar willing to help me out?  </p>
