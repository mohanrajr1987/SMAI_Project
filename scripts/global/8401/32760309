<p>I have written a jmeter script for my web application which runs from single system.</p>  <p>What should i do so that i can run same script from some other IP addresses/systems.</p>  <p>I ran it on other system connected in LAN (REMOTE RUN), but it ran only on that system. </p>  <p>I want to run same script from multiple IPs/Systems. Is there is any setting or update we can do in jmeter so that it will run those script from a bunch of IP addresses?</p>  <p>Or, Can we run jmeter from some browser which uses multiple proxies ?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
