<p>Imagine my goal is to calculate the maximum number of users supported to get an average transaction response of 3s?</p>  <p>Or imagine that the goal includes more complex rules as a ruleset, such as increase the number of threads until the response time averages 5s or the slowest page exceeds 10s or this particular page averages more than 5s.</p>  <p>Is there any such thing for JMeter, even as a plugin?</p>
