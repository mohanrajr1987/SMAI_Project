<p>I have never used Jmeter or Maven and have been assigned to the task in my work place. I have Jmeter Functional tests which are integrated with maven and when I run it from maven they run fine and produce a result like below: However, the approach is okay if all tests are green. If something fails I donâ€™t know which test run has failed. Can we do something to improve the reporting of maven from Jmeter. I saw something called jmeter-analysis-Maven-plugin which I beleive is to analyse performance test results from Jmeter. Any idea or any other plugin you know to report functional tests of Jmeter in a better way. Also one more question. If we have to use this analyze plugin do I need to download the jar file of the plugin. But where to keep it. Is there any guide which explains how to use a new jmeter plugin with maven from scratch?</p>  <p>[INFO] Tests Run: 7, Failures: 0 [INFO] Total time: 25.714 s</p>  <p>Thanks in Advance.</p>  <p>Cheers Vivek</p>
