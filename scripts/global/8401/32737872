<p>What I try to achieve is to get JMeter results in 2 formats, for the same test execution. CSV is the one I'm mostly interested in, unless there are failures - then I may need to use data which can be saved only to XML. I can't use XML for most occasions, due to misc reasons.</p>  <p>I was looking at <strong>jmeter.save.saveservice.output_format</strong> cfg entry, it doesn't seem to accept both as valid entry. I was also looking at JMeter code itself, it also clearly separates both options.</p>  <p>Did anyone invent a hack to get both JMeter outputs at the same time?</p>  <p>Solution for both standalone JMeter and jmeter-maven-plugin is welcome.</p>
