<p>I am trying to do Basic Authentication for protected endpoints. I tried the following :</p>  <ol> <li>In the HTTP Header Manager, add an entry with the name "Authorization" and the value "Basic [encoded credentials from above]" as suggested in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12560494/jmeter-basic-authentication">JMeter Basic Authentication</a></li> <li>Added Http Authorization manager and added the  <code>base url as https://shopping-qa.myproject.mydomain.com</code>along with the username and password. The url of the endpoint is <code>https://shopping-qa.myproject.mydomain.com/api/v3/profile/summary</code>. </li> </ol>  <p>While it works when I use the option 1, it does not work when I use option 2. I also uncommented <code>httpclient.parameters.file=httpclient.parameters</code> in <code>jmeter.Properties</code> and <code>http.authentication.preemptive$Boolean=true</code> in <code>httpclient.parameters</code>. But I still do not get the authentication to work. </p>  <p>Any suggestions on where I am going wrong? Thank you!</p>
