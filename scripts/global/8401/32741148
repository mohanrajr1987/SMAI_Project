<p>I am load / performance testing videos playing my in mobile app.  I have got the script down.  However, I don't know what are the best listeners to use and how to interpret the results.  Essentially what are the things that I should be looking for when performance testing video played at apps ? I see a commercial plug in that is available that provides some cool analysis.  However, are there any built in jmeter listeners that I can use?  Any other suggestions ?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
