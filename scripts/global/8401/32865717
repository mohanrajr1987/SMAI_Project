<p>I have JMeter, then I integrated Selenium WebDriver. I created <code>jp@gc - WebDriver Sampler</code>, and the code runs perfect. When I change <code>Number of Threads (users)</code> to 10, this open me 10 Fireforx Browser and the idea of load testing is not good, because the last browser (10th) start after few second (20 sec).  How I can run all this in parallel?  <strong>I want to simulate 10 users to clicks in the site exactly in same time!</strong> :)</p>  <p>Let's say this is the page, which I want to be opened in same time:</p>  <pre><code>WDS.sampleResult.sampleStart() WDS.browser.get('http://jmeter-plugins.org') WDS.sampleResult.sampleEnd() </code></pre>  <p>Thanks</p>
