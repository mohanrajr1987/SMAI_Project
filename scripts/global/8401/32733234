<p>I have a requirement where I need to use multiple certificates in Jmeter.  So I have created a .jks file and imported the certificates into this file. Configured the jks file is system.properties in jmeter and used keystore config element. I have tried with HTTPClient 3.1 and 4 and have set https.use.cached.ssl.context=false in jmeter.properties. But jmeter loads only one alias though I have 2 entries in the .jks file. Please let me know how to make Jmeter load all the aliases in the file.</p>
