<p>I am running a staging cluster of apache/nginx webservers where the domain has basic authentication restricted access. My goal is to test performance of the cluster with jmeter.</p>  <p>In order to pass the authentication I have added the HTTP Authentication controler of jmeter. This works, BUT every request shows two logentries at apache. One 200 and one 401. This is normal behavior as of the first request the user must be authenticated. Unfortunatelly, jmeter does this on every request.</p>  <p>How can I make sure that each thread/user only requests access once. Or even better, how could I grant jmeter access with without every user needing to authenticat. I believe that this will impact the test results.</p>  <p>Thank you for any hint on this.</p>
