<p>I know I can use foreign key instead putting the whole object in the memory. Just for the curiosity, I wonder which approach is better: using Attach or Single() in this 1-to-Many relationship scenario? Which one is better in terms of performance?</p>  <p>Using Attach();</p>  <pre><code>        Player myPlayer = new Player();         myPlayer.FullName = txt_Name.Text;          Team myTeam = new Team { TeamId = Convert.ToInt32(drp_Teams.SelectedValue) };         db.Teams.Attach(myTeam);         myPlayer.CurrentTeam = myTeam;          db.Players.Add(myPlayer);         db.SaveChanges(); </code></pre>  <p>And using Single():</p>  <pre><code>        Player myPlayer = new Player();         myPlayer.FullName = txt_Name.Text;          int teamId = Convert.ToInt32(drp_Teams.SelectedValue);         myPlayer.CurrentTeam = db.Teams.Single(t =&gt; t.TeamId == teamId);          db.Players.Add(myPlayer);         db.SaveChanges(); </code></pre>
