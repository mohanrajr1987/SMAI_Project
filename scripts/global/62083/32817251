<p>We have many mobile services which work by pair, one for the Dev and one for the production. These mobile servies use a SQL Azure Database as repository.</p>  <p>In summary :</p>  <p><strong>Production-Service ----> Production-Database on the Production-Server</strong></p>  <p><strong>Dev-Service ----> Dev-Database on the Dev-Server.</strong></p>  <p>Actually we can publish on the dev service. We've got a blue smiley (that appears after a few seconds) and modification on database (add column) are performed.</p>  <p>But, when we publish on the prod service. We’ve got also a blue smiley (which appears immediately) BUT the modification on database (add column) doesn’t appears !</p>  <p>After investigation, the only thing change between the two environments, since the last success publishing, is the auditing activation on the prod server. Since this audit was disabled.</p>  <p>More deep, when we read the migration History table, we can see a line for the dev but not on prod.</p>  <p>On the dev-database :</p>  <pre><code>SELECT [MigrationId]       ,[ContextKey]       ,[Model]       ,[ProductVersion] FROM [dev-server-name].[dev-database-name].[__MigrationHistory] </code></pre>  <p>Result  => 201509240834243_AutomaticMigration   last migration : today  </p>  <p>On the prod-database :</p>  <pre><code>SELECT [MigrationId]       ,[ContextKey]       ,[Model]       ,[ProductVersion] FROM [prod-server-name].[prod-database-name].[__MigrationHistory] </code></pre>  <p>Result  => 201506291336002_AutomaticMigration   last migration : 2015/06/29</p>  <p>For information, we have this problem for all our production services. Conversely, our development services work perfectly.</p>  <p>The only common point between all of our production services is the server on which their database is hosted. But each service has its own database.</p>  <p><strong>In summary, we can no longer publish any changes on our databases in production.</strong></p>  <p>Thank you in advance for your help.</p>
