<p>I've read through a lot of posts on this but nothing has worked. </p>  <p>I'm trying to add a default value to a column like this:</p>  <pre><code>        AlterColumn("dbo.BusinessUnit_Map", "RelationshipType", c =&gt; c.String(nullable: false, defaultValue: "RollsUpTo")); </code></pre>  <p>This produces the error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The object 'DF_dbo.BusinessUnit_Map_RelationshipType' is dependent on column 'RelationshipType'.   ALTER TABLE ALTER COLUMN RelationshipType failed because one or more objects access this column.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I cannot find this constraint anywhere. Below is a screenshot showing the only default constraint on the table. </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/NqdXJ.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/NqdXJ.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>One interesting thing is, if I try dropping the column and re-adding it, that works fine. It's only when I use <code>AlterColumn</code> that it fails.</p>  <p>I've tried dropping the constraints like this:</p>  <pre><code>            Sql("ALTER TABLE dbo.BusinessUnit_Map DROP CONSTRAINT DF_dbo.BusinessUnit_Map_RelationshipType"); </code></pre>  <p>But the <code>.</code> is a syntax error, so I replace it with three underscores:</p>  <pre><code>            Sql("ALTER TABLE dbo.BusinessUnit_Map DROP CONSTRAINT DF_dbo___BusinessUnit_Map_RelationshipType"); </code></pre>  <p>But the system responds with</p>  <blockquote>   <p>'DF_dbo___BusinessUnit_Map_RelationshipType' is not a constraint.   Could not drop constraint. See previous errors.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Where is this constraint and how can I turn it off?</p>  <p><strong>Update</strong></p>  <p>One suggestion is to try this query to search for that constraint:</p>  <pre><code>select o.type_desc,o2.name as parent_name,*  from sys.objects as o left join sys.objects as o2 on o.parent_object_id=o2.object_id where o.name='DF_dbo.BusinessUnit_Map_RelationshipType' </code></pre>  <p>This returned zero results, so I modified it to see what it would tell me about <code>BusinessUnit_Map</code></p>  <pre><code>select o.type_desc,o2.name as parent_name,*  from sys.objects as o left join sys.objects as o2 on o.parent_object_id=o2.object_id where o2.name='BusinessUnit_Map' </code></pre>  <p>The results of this query are shown below, and they do not contain the mystery constraint.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/EtEaw.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/EtEaw.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
