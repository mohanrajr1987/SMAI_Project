<p>I've created an MVC app with a simple form using the codefirst approach. It has an ID, title, and description, pretty straightforward.</p>  <p>It has automatically created me a nice 'create' form which is awesome. However, the description field is only a, input, I'd rather it be a textarea given this will likely house quite a bit of text. I know I can just change it on the form but it's also on the other forms created by EF, it would be great if there was a way this could be done automatically. Any ideas?</p>
