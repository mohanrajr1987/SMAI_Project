<p>I apologize in advance for what could be an obvious question, but I'm new to Entity Framework.</p>  <p>I Have an EF Code First project which is in a specific assembly : <code>MyStuff.Persistence</code></p>  <p>It uses <strong>existing domain classes</strong> from: <code>MyStuff.Domain</code></p>  <p>I've the ability to modify <code>MyStuff.Domain</code> which will be exposed thru <code>MyStuff.Service</code></p>  <p>I want to synchronize my EF 6.0 code first project with an <strong>existing database</strong></p>  <p>So, I decided to follow this tutorial :  <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj200620.aspx" rel="nofollow">Code First From Database MSDN guide</a>, </p>  <p>The problem is that It creates the domain classes in <code>MyStuff.Persistence</code>, superseding the existing ones in <code>MyStuff.Domain</code></p>  <p>What can I do to synchronize both existing elements(database/domain)?  I've read about Fluent API by googling, but I can't find this exact use case.<br> Thanks for your help.</p>
