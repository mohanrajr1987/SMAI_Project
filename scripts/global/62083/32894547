<p>I use EF 6.1.x Code First.</p>  <p>I have read that an Index with Filter Expression is not supported by EF latest.</p>  <p>There is also no solution on SO:</p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24361518/ef-6-1-unique-nullable-index">EF 6.1 Unique Nullable Index</a></p>  <p>One year later, what is the working way to make the this Filter Index working with Code First and DbMigrations?</p>  <pre><code>CREATE UNIQUE NONCLUSTERED INDEX [IX_DefaultLanguageApplicationId] ON [dbo].[Languages] (     [IsDefaultLanguage] ASC,     [ApplicationId] ASC, ) WHERE ([IsDefaultLanguage]=(1)) </code></pre>
