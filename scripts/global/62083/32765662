<p>I am using Entity Framework 5 and code first for the database modeling and mapping.  When I attempt to execute the query via an API call I receive an error that states <code>ORA-00942: table or view does not exist</code>.  Reviewing the query it appears to be in a format that is not typical for Oracle queries.  </p>  <p>My .config connection string is</p>  <pre><code>&lt;connectionStrings&gt;   &lt;add name="Entities" connectionString="Data Source=development;                                          User ID=user;Password=password"                        providerName="Oracle.DataAccess.Client" /&gt; &lt;/connectionStrings&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Within the OnModelCreating() I am mapping as follows</p>  <pre><code>modelBuilder.Entity&lt;Job&gt;().ToTable("Table1", "schema"); </code></pre>  <p>The query that is being generated that I can see in the debugger does not execute via a copy/paste to Oracle.  </p>  <pre><code>SELECT "Extent1"."ColumnName" AS "ColumnName" FROM "schema"."Table1" "Extent1" </code></pre>  <p>I would have thought that the fact I am using the <code>Oracle.DataAccess.Client</code> provider that the query would be generated appropriately.  How do I convince EF5 that it should generate the query in a specific fashion to be compatible with Oracle?  </p>
