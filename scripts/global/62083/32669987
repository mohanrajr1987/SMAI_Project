<p>I'm certain that my issue extends from a misinterpretation of exactly how Base type/Sub type entities are related, but bear with me.</p>  <p>Say I have two classes:</p>  <pre><code>public class Business {     public int UniqueID { get; set; }     public string Name { get; set; } }  public class BusinessType1 : Business {     public string SomeRelatedThing { get; set; } }  public class BusinessType2 : Business {     public string SomeNotRelatedThing { get; set; } } </code></pre>  <p>In my application, I am using the base type for the most part. Some pages are contextual to the Sub types however, but need to be versatile enough to handle either (DNRY).</p>  <p>The page is only given the base type in context, and must load data from either BusinessType1 or BusinessType2.</p>  <p>The problem I am facing is that I need to ascertain if the base type (Business) is either linked with BusinessType1 or BusinessType2. I would prefer to do this without making a query to determine if the key exists in each table.</p>  <p>As far as I can see, this is not possible - hence my question;</p>  <p>Is there a way to achieve this using minimal queries to the DB?</p>
