<p>I've been trying to split my database entities into several DbContext in Entity Framework Code First. However, I need to set an one to many relationship for two tables which are defined in different DbContext.  I get the following error when I try to execute the enable-migrations command: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/TFH56.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/TFH56.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/TLsWP.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/TLsWP.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Are there any way to handle this situation or it is the limitation in entity framework?</p>  <p>As a note that, the TestTable which is covered by the error message is not a member of SKContext. It belong to another DbContext.</p>
