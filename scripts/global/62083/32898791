<p>I use Entity Framework 6 Code First with Fluent API, and some of the properties of data classes have max length defined through HasMaxLength.</p>  <p>In WPF, in order to enforce the input constraints, I add MaxLength in the XAML for TextBox. At the moment, I have to define something like 40 characters for EF through HasMaxLength, and then define 40 again in the XAML.</p>  <p>It there built-in way in .NET Framework or some 3rd party component that can apply what in HasMaxlength of EF to MaxLength in WPF?</p>
