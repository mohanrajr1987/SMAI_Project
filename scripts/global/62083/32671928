<p>I have to create an application in MVC 5 using EF6. I have already created the schema for the database in SQL Server 2012 and now I want to query this in my app.</p>  <p>The workflow that seems fit is Code First with Existing Database and I have tried to follow below resources but they are a little confusing to me as I am a beginner.</p>  <p>Is there a way I can still use my DB schema in SQL server and go ahead with Code First approach using generated data models from DB.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/overview/getting-started/getting-started-with-ef-using-mvc/creating-an-entity-framework-data-model-for-an-asp-net-mvc-application" rel="nofollow">http://www.asp.net/mvc/overview/getting-started/getting-started-with-ef-using-mvc/creating-an-entity-framework-data-model-for-an-asp-net-mvc-application</a></p>  <p><a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/overview/getting-started/introduction/getting-started" rel="nofollow">http://www.asp.net/mvc/overview/getting-started/introduction/getting-started</a></p>
