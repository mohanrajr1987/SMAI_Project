<p>I'm using EF code first w/ SQL Azure database. I tried to do database migrations in Nuget PM Console using following command:(xxxxxxx is the SQL Azure server instance name)</p>  <pre><code>Update-Database -ConnectionString "Server=tcp:xxxxxxxx.database.windows.net,1433;Database=myDb;User ID=myUserName@xxxxxxxx;Password=mypassword;Trusted_Connection=False;Encrypt=True;Connection Timeout=30;" -ConnectionProviderName System.Data.SqlClient </code></pre>  <p>Then I got the error message: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>"Login failed for user 'myUserName'. This session has been assigned a   tracing ID of 'ab6fa467-e98a-4ce0-85b5-21638d9433ee'.  Provide this   tracing ID to customer support when you need assistance."</p> </blockquote>  <p>I'm pretty sure the connectionstring is correct since I copied it from the Azure portal. Also, I tried the exact same credential myUserName/mypassword to log on SQL Azure via SSMS and VS Server Explorer and they both worked perfect. My IP address is in the SQL Azure server whitelist.</p>  <p>I've been trapped with this for a few hours...Any thoughts will be appreciated!</p>
