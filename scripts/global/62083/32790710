<p>I have a <em>User</em> entity in my <em>DbContext</em>. What I want is that <strong>users should be able to give references/leave comments for each other</strong>, therefore I have created <em>Reference</em> entity.</p>  <pre><code>public class Reference {     public virtual User By { get; set; } // user who leaves a reference      public virtual User To { get; set; } // user who has given a reference      public string Opinions { get; set; } } </code></pre>  <p>in <em>User</em> entity</p>  <pre><code>public virtual ICollection&lt;Reference&gt; ReferencedTo { get; set; } // collection of references that user has given  public virtual ICollection&lt;Reference&gt; ReferencedBy { get; set; } // collection of references that user has been given </code></pre>  <p>What should I do to make it work with either DataAnnonations or FluentAPI, or how would you approach to this and solve?</p>
