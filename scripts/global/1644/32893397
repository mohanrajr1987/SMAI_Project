<p>I've got the following code I need to make sure is performance sensitive: </p>  <pre><code>var $content = $(htmlString);  //Stop new element from triggering reflow?  $content.css('display', 'none');  //add slide to DOM $content.appendTo(options.els.$slider); </code></pre>  <p>I can't remember if a reflow is triggered on any DOM manipulation or if there are exceptions like adding an out of the flow element to the DOM. Will the above code cause a reflow if <code>options.els.$slider</code> is in the flow? </p>
