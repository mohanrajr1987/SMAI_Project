<p>Facebook uses history.pushstate as far as I understand. So, if you wait for the document.onload or document.readystate you will only get the moment the entire DOM is completely rendered.</p>  <p>But parts of the FB Home page are rendered separately through AJAX calls (BigPipe) and browser history manipulation, some load faster some slower. Also, if you click "Home" it will not do redirection but history manipulation. How is it possible to catch these events? Because setting a callback to listen for  object mutation for MutationObserver, you need to have the nodes already loaded, but I want to catch them as soon as they arrive, before DOM rendering.</p>  <p>The idea is to catch page content before the browser renders it.</p>
