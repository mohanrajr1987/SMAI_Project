<p>I'm using the w3c Resource Timing API. window.performance.getEntriesByType("resource"); This gives a list of resources including iframes. However, to get hold of the resources of the embedded iframes, I need to get hold of the iframe's performance object which requires me to have the reference to its' DOM node/element.</p>  <pre><code>        var myiframe2 = $("#myiframe2");         var myiframeContentWindow = myiframe2[0].contentWindow;         var iframeContentPerf = myiframeContentWindow.performance; </code></pre>  <p>The question is, how to get hold of the iframe's node reference if all I know is the URL of the iframe, which is all I know(I will not know the iframe's id or name unlike the code sample above).</p>  <p>Other than iterating through the document's elements and then filtering iframes and comparing the URL of the iframe with what the Resource Timing API returned, is there a simple way to get hold of the iframe's DOM node (given the iframe's URL) ?</p>
