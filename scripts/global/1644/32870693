<p>I have a button with id <code>btnGo</code> wrapped in a form with id <code>frmNewRequest</code>. When I tried to use </p>  <pre><code>$('#frmNewRequest').on('click', '#btnGo', (function(e){ //do something })); </code></pre>  <p>it was not working but when I changed to </p>  <pre><code>$('#btnGo').click(function(e){ //do something }); </code></pre>  <p>it was working. What is the different between the two ?</p>  <p>I have a DOM dynamically generated upon the click of <code>btnGo</code>, but when posted to codeigniter's controller, the newly DOM elements are not posted. Anyone now what's the problem ?</p>
