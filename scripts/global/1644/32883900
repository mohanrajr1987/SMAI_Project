<p>I have a problem that is frustrating me a lot. Context is HTML + JS/jQuery. I have 2 <code>select</code> and 2 <code>button</code> elements. All HTML is generated DOM manipulation by Javascript.</p>  <p>The buttons are set up to show the currently selected value in a <code>select</code> tag only using the object reference it got when generated (no ids used at all).</p>  <p>So:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Click Button A -> show val from Select A<br>   Click Button B -> show val from Select B</p> </blockquote>  <p>Everything works as expected so far. The Problem is that the Buttons in consideration are moved back and forth between 2 places in the DOM using an 3rd Party library. After a button is moved it no longer works as expected. How is this even possible?</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Click Button A -> show val from Select B</p> </blockquote>  <p>P.S. I should point out that I had a jsfiddle that did exactly that (w/o the 3rd Party stuff) and it worked perfectly.</p>  <p>I should point out too that I am solely interested in this question:</p>  <p>How is it possible that an object reference gets replaced by another one?</p>
