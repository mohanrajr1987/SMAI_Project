<p>I have a page with javascript in <code>$(function() {});</code> Everything works fine except a couple clients, sitting behind the web-proxy â€” my code doesn't work there. Digging into the problem, I found that <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> event is not fired for those clients (they use modern Google Chrome, so it should work).  Is there a way to find a list of pending tasks/request which defer this event firing? Also is there a way to listen to any events which fire before DOMContentLoaded?</p>
