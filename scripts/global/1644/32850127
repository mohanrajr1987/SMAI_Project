<p>I'd like to add an element's HTML to a parent element and then immediately get the height of the parent element.</p>  <p>An example of what I want to do is:</p>  <pre><code>parent.innerHTML += childHTML; alert(parent.children[0].clientHeight); </code></pre>  <p>This seems to work accurately in Chrome, but I know that JS is supposed to be single threaded, so in theory an implementation might have the DOM update after the thread has finished... but perhaps not?</p>  <p>Is it required to change the DOM immediately (at least in the way that I want it to), or does Chrome just use a convenient implementation?</p>
