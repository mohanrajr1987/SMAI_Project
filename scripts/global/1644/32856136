<p>Snippet of HTML code I need to retrieve values from:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div class="elgg-foot"&gt;   &lt;input type="hidden" value="41" name="guid"&gt;   &lt;input class="elgg-button elgg-button-submit" type="submit" value="Save"&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I need to get the value 41, which is simple enough with:</p>  <pre><code>var x = document.getElementsByTagName("input")[0]; var y = x.attributes[1].value; </code></pre>  <p>However I need to make sure I'm actually retrieving values from inside "elgg-foot", because there are multiple div classes in the HTML code.</p>  <p>I can get the class like this:</p>  <pre><code>var a = document.getElementsByClassName("elgg-foot")[0]; </code></pre>  <p>And then I tried to combine it in various ways with <code>var x</code>, but I don't really know the syntax/logic to do it.  For example:</p>  <pre><code>var full = a.getElementsByTagName("input")[0]; </code></pre>  <p>So: Retrieve value 41 from inside unique class elg-foot.</p>  <p>I spent hours googling for this, but couldn't find a solution (partly because I don't know exactly what to search for)</p>  <p>Edit: Thanks for the answers everyone, they all seem to work. I almost had it working myself, just forgot a <code>[0]</code> somewhere in my original code. Appreciate the JQuery as well, never used it before :-)</p>
