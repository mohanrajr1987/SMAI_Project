<p>I need to create a new angular scope and attach it to a DOM element. I'm modifying a third party control so I don't have the option of just using a directive.</p>  <p>I need to do something like:</p>  <pre><code>... = thirdPartyCallbackfunction(domElement){         var myNewScope = $scope.$new(true);         myNewScope.title = 'Hello';         domElement.scope = myNewScope; //??? } </code></pre>  <p>Also, I've tried adding <code>ng-scope</code> manually to the DOM element, but ng-inspector shows me that it's not creating a new child scope.</p>  <pre><code>$(domElement).scope(); </code></pre>  <p>Gives me the root scope when trying that.</p>  <p>The <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/type/$rootScope.Scope#$new" rel="nofollow">docs</a> weren't very helpful either.</p>
