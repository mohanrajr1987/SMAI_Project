<p>I know there is the javascript <code>getBoundingClientRect()</code> to retrieve the position of an element on a web page, but i need to write a script (preferably in php) that take a list of url and retrieves the position of a specific element on every page (an <code>&lt;a href="specificurl"&gt;</code>).</p>  <p>The position could be expressed in px, or it could be "it's in header", "it's in footer", "it's in sidebar" (that way it's better for my purpose).</p>  <p>There is a method to do it in "simple" way?</p>
