<p>I have been working on this forever. I have attached a first picture of the steps I am trying to do in VBA. This particular field that I have having trouble populating for a client of mine appears to be a drop down but when you click it, it has a search field. I know the option value I want the field to be set to but using doc.getElementbyID("id_referrer").selectedIndex = fieldValue is not working. See the first picture for the steps of what I'm trying to do, then the second picture for the behind the scenes look at the classes and then all the different commands that I've tried to populate this field. The save button works, but nothing ever is populated for the Referrer or it bombs.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/jwAfZ.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/jwAfZ.png" alt="firstpicture"></a> <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/t64xo.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/t64xo.png" alt="secondpicture"></a></p>
