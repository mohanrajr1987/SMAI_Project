<p>I am trying to set visiblity of legend by calling javascript function from setExtend() method of ChartModel class.</p>  <pre><code>function extendLegend() {        alert("Some Hope");          this.cfg.legend = {                          show: true,             placement: 'outsideGrid'     }; } </code></pre>  <p>the problem is, The title of Chart &amp; this function(extendLegend) is never being called in version 5.1 and legend is never appeared on screen. but if I switch to version 5.2 it works simply fine.</p>
