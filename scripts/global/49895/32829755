<p>I've just made a slide out menu overlay similar to PFMobile menu, but just using pure html +css. When i use it over my prime face wizard the input components show on top of the menu.</p>  <p>I've taken screenshots to show you guys before and after I open the menu <a href="http://prntscr.com/8limbg" rel="nofollow">http://prntscr.com/8limbg</a></p>  <p>How could i make it so that my menu is on top of all other components or make prime faces go below it. the rest of it (panels, datatables etc) work perfectly with it.</p>
