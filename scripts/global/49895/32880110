<p>My tasks is to create pager, what I've already done, but I stuck at one point, </p>  <p>I need to hide pageLinks ( Small boxes that indixe on which page you are ) and leave only "arrows" to move between pages.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;p:dataTable value= "#{inboxController.list}" var="task"  paginator="true" paginatorPosition="bottom" pageLinks="0"  rowsPerPageTemplate="10,20,25,30,50" rows="20"  lazy="true"&gt;` </code></pre>  <p>So as you can see, I used <code>pageLinks="0"</code>  which sets up, how many page box'es I want to show, and it does, what I want, until I move to another page and all boxes shows up again.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
