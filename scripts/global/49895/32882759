<p>I have a datatable where users can modify rows. Everything was fine until I added Primefaces <code>&lt;p:socket&gt;</code>, so that if there are any changes, all the users working on the table are notified. But from time to time I see this xml error during login/logout on container managed authentication:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>This XML file does not appear to have any style information associated   with it. The document tree is shown below.</p> </blockquote>  <pre><code>&lt;partial-response id="j_id1"&gt;  &lt;changes&gt;  &lt;update id="j_id1:javax.faces.ViewState:0"&gt;  &lt;![CDATA[ 8290402593671514094:3228216940573345142 ]]&gt;  &lt;/update&gt;  &lt;/changes&gt;  &lt;/partial-response&gt; </code></pre>  <p>All I did was to simply add code from <a href="http://www.primefaces.org/showcase/push/notify.xhtml" rel="nofollow">Primefaces notify showcase</a>. Why does it show up?</p>
