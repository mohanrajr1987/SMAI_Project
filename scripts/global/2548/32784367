<p>So I want to do some experiments with c500K ("problem of having 500K concurrent connections") in Golang, and <code>net.ListenUDP</code> (and its equivalent client connection part) started in 500K goroutines in a single process is not looking like a way to achieve it.</p>  <p>What is the "common" pattern on writing multiple socket listeners/clients in Golang using poll/select-like model?</p>
