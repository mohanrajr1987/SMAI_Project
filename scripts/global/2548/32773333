<p>I have a multicast UDP stream that I can watch (with almost no errors) if I use ffplay's infbuf option. </p>  <p>But when I try to encode it via ffmpeg, ffmpeg reports a lot of errors and the resultant video has lots of errors.</p>  <p>I have tried setting the  fifo_size to a super large value  like 655360 and the buf_size  as per  <a href="https://www.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-protocols.html#udp" rel="nofollow">https://www.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-protocols.html#udp</a>. But none of gets rid of the decode errors in ffmpeg. </p>  <p>Is it possible to provide settings to ffmpeg that do something similar to what ffplay's -intbuf does?  I want my video encode to be as error free as video playback via ffplay.</p>
