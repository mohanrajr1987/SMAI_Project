<p>I'm working on my second experiment for my master thesis and my supervisor had some requirements on this experiment and I don't really know how to proceed. Earlier I was thinking that it should be just to forward the packets but now facing the problem hands on I don't know where to begin.</p>  <p>The setup is Computer 1 ->Measurement point->System Under Test->Measurement point-> Computer2</p>  <p>The System Under Test consists of 2 VMs created with the XEN management tool XL. There is a bridge from computer 1 on the interface "eth0" to "SUT" which is connected to the VM and the same thing on the otherside to computer 2.</p>  <p>I'm going to send 2 UDP streams and compare the timestamps over the measurement points with two servers on computer 2. The streams are going to be separated by port number and keyid for the stream.</p>  <p>My question is how do I make one of the UDP stream take the route through one of the VMs and the other UDP stream to take the other route?</p>
