<p>I can send a packet with this:</p>  <pre><code>Public Class Form1 Dim publisher As New Sockets.UdpClient(0) Dim subscriber As New Sockets.UdpClient(2000) Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click     publisher.Connect(TBTo.Text, TBPort.Text)     Dim sendbytes() As Byte = ASCII.GetBytes("test")     publisher.Send(sendbytes, sendbytes.Length) End Sub End Class </code></pre>  <p>It works great and using WireShark I can see on Port 9 a UDP Packet being sent to my IP (which I type into the address/word box).</p>  <p>I understand for WOL (Which I DO have working, just want to make my own application for fun/experience) you need a MAC, will it just "adding a MAC" address to this make it a WOL packet or is it more complicated than that? </p>  <p><em>NOTE:</em> I can see the difference in WOL and UDP packets in Wireshark and changing my IP to "MYIP". For example below is a WOL packet sent from a WOL application.</p>  <p><code>40.000203000 MYIP 192.168.1.1 WOL 144 MagicPacket for Micro-St_21:94:b6 (44:8a:5b:21:94:b6)</code></p>  <p>Compared to a normal UDP packet:</p>  <p><code>69 12170.303276000 192.168.1.1 MYIP UDP 46 Source port: 57465  Destination port: 9</code></p>  <p>EDIT: I have played about A LOT with some examples but they are not the best.</p>
