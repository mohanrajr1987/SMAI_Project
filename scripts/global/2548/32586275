<p>I would like to ask, if anyone had dealt with a similar situation?</p>  <p>Client A sends data via UDP, Client B receives the data via TCP.. But we started to face an issue when TCP sends a ACK message to UDP and if it fails, client A keeps sending same message over and over again (and current systems setup process all packages) causing not just duplicate records, but also a performance issues and etc. </p>  <p>Can anyone advise what would be the best way to address the above issue? Currently I am thinking of implementing some set of rules (if error/connection error for ACK msg to UDP when don't process a message and send ACK again). </p>  <p>Overview:</p>  <ul> <li>Client A (GSM Based device used to transmit a data)</li> <li>Client B (Socket Server TCP) used for delivering/processing data to the platform. </li> </ul>  <p>Any help would be highly appreciated</p>
