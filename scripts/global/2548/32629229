<p>I have a question, is it possible to ´sendto´ information from one process which is initialized on UDP to another process initialized on TCP ( this is all in the same .c) I have one process which receive information on UDP and this one has to send this information locally to the TCP one and I dont know how to connect ( I know you cant connect with udp, I mean just send the datagram) them. Can anyone help me?</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
