<p>I have an RFID receiver that constantly sends UDP packets to port 5757. When connected over ethernet to my desktop, all packets are received and valid (confirmed with Wireshark), and there is no issue. When I connect the receiver via ethernet to my laptop, not one UDP packet is received.</p>  <p>Things I have tried: I have connected the laptop to the desktop over ethernet, and have sent UDP packets via netcat in both directions. Netcat has no issues with sending/receiving the data.  </p>  <p>I've also captured and saved the RFID UDP packets on the desktop, and played them back using bittwist, first on the desktop, and had no issues capturing them in Wireshark(desktop). Then I copied the saved packets over to the laptop, played them back using bittwist, and had zero UDP packets captured in Wireshark(laptop).</p>  <p>Finally, I updated the ethernet driver and had the same results. </p>  <p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
