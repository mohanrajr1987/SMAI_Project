<p>I have the code below which creates a socket UDP-style. I run and compile the code and it works just fine. If I then use "netcat -u  " I am able to send messages from the client to the server but not the other way around. So what I want and what I have been trying to do is to read from stdin and printing it(all this running in a second thread). Making it a two-way communication. Anyone know what I need to fix? Thanks in advance.</p>  <pre><code>import java.io.IOException; import java.net.DatagramPacket; import java.net.DatagramSocket;  public class NetcatUDP {      public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {          int port = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);         byte[] buffer = new byte[65536];          DatagramPacket packet = new DatagramPacket(buffer, buffer.length);         DatagramSocket socket = new DatagramSocket(port);          new Thread() {             @Override             public void run() {                  // Read from stdin and send somehow?             }         }.start();          while (true) {             socket.receive(packet);             System.out.println(new String(packet.getData()).trim());         }     } } </code></pre>
