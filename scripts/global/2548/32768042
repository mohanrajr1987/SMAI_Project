<p>What disadvantages (or advantages) are there to setting different values for a send and receive buffer on opposite sides of a connection? It seems to make the most sense (and the norm) to keep these values the same. But if one side (say the sender side) has the resources to double their buffer size, what implications could this have?</p>  <p>I guess a related question is, what disadvantages are there to setting a larger-than-required buffer size? From what I've read, it sounds like you could potentially overflow the receive buffer if your send buffer is larger. Additionally, it seems like there may not be a need to increase buffer sizes as long as your applications are keeping up with the load and can handle max-size messages. It doesn't necessarily mean you could handle more data throughput because you are still limited by the opposite endpoint. Is this correct?</p>  <p>The specific kernel settings in question are as follows:</p>  <pre><code>net.core.wmem_max net.core.rmem_max </code></pre>
