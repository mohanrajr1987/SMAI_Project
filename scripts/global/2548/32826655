<p>I have an UDP server on a small linux controller with about 123 MB RAM which is communicating with a single UDP-client. On this linux controller a c# application is running with mono 3.2.8.  Everything is running fine, except that the udp connection is consuming memory rapidly and GC is collecting it rarely (memory always growing exactly 65,552 bytes between console output 1 and 2).</p>  <p>My client side code is as following:</p>  <pre><code>    UdpClient udpClient = new UdpClient (port,AddressFamily.InterNetwork);            byte[] frame;     IPEndPoint masterEndPoint = null;      try     {         while(true)         {                                 masterEndPoint = null;                     frame = null;                     Console.WriteLine("Memory 1: " + GC.GetTotalMemory(false));                     frame = _udpClient.Receive(ref masterEndPoint);                     Console.WriteLine("Memory 2: " + GC.GetTotalMemory(false));            ...          }     ...     } </code></pre>  <p>Is there a possibilty that memory isnt growing that fast, like using a buffer instead? If not is it possible to get the unreferenced objects "masterEndPoint" and "frame" collected more rapidly?</p>  <p>Tell me if you need further details!</p>  <p>Any help appreciated!</p>
