<p>I am developing a logic core to perform data transfer between a FPGA and a PC over ethernet, using a LAN8710 PHY on my FPGA board.</p>  <p>I've achieved to transfer some UDP data packets from the FPGA to the PC. It's a simple core that complies with the PHY transfer requirements. It builds the UDP package and transfer it to the PC.</p>  <p>To check the reception on the PC, I am using Wireshark and as said above, I receive the packets correctly. I've checked the reception with a simple UDP receiver written by myself.</p>  <p>But, I've noticed that I only receive these packets when Wireshark is running on the PC. I mean, if Wireshark is ON, my application receives the packets too, and the counter of received packets of the following picture increases. (This picture is not mine, just one from the internet)</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/wsChT.gif" rel="nofollow">http://i.stack.imgur.com/wsChT.gif</a></p>  <p>If I close Wireshark, the PC stops receiving packets and the counter of received packets stops. My application stops receiving too.</p>  <ol> <li><p>Although novice on networking topics, I suspect that this issue is related to PC-side. Seems like Wireshark is "opening/closing" the ethernet communication channel, or something like that. Does anyone knows about this issue?</p></li> <li><p>To build a functional core to transfer data between a PC and the FPGA, I've developed a core to transfer and receive UDP packets. Next step will be ARP implementation (to let the PC identify my FPGA board, as I understand). What protocols are necessary to perform full-duplex data transfer between this 2 devices?</p></li> </ol>  <p>Thank you very much in advance,</p>  <p>migue.</p>
