<p>I've been working with a <a href="http://usa.denon.com/us/product/hometheater/avreceiversht/avrx1100w" rel="nofollow">Denon AVR-X1100W</a> in an effort to find out whether or not I can ping it over a local network. For this, I am using C# in order to make a simple program.</p>  <p><em>How can I ping this type of device?</em> A traditional ping command doesn't work, however, as it lacks an actual web server internally. I understand that a socket needs to be opened and, from there, a specific message sent with UDP.</p>  <p>Beyond creating a socket, I am unsure on how to continue.</p>
