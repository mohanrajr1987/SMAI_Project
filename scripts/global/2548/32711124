<p>I am using the stream, a feature of the VLC player to do a video streaming. </p>  <p>The video format that I am streaming is in mp4 format. The destination setup of the video streaming is through udp at the ip address 127.0.0.1 and port 9000.  There are mainly four issues I am facing:</p>  <ol> <li><p>During the streaming of the mp4 video, I do not see the video playing on the VLC player. It shows a black screen and I could only hear the audio of the video. If a wmv video is streamed instead, I could see the video playing as well as hearing the audio. Does the format of the video file affects streaming? Why I could not see the video playing on VLC when the mp4 file is streamed? The option of display locally is checked. </p></li> <li><p>Also when the mwv format video is streamed, the video is very pixelated. Is there a way to make adjustment to the stream so that the video is clear.</p></li> <li><p>Header file WinSock2.h:No such file or directory but there isnâ€™t any build errors, program able to build.</p></li> <li><p>How do I go about connecting my udp client to the VLC video stream so that I could receive the video file that is being stream on the VLC player and display it in a QMediaPlayer. I am using c++ and Qt creator. </p></li> </ol>  <p>My udp code are as follows:</p>  <pre><code>#include&lt;stdio.h&gt; #include&lt;winsock2.h&gt;  #pragma comment(lib,"ws2_32.lib") //Winsock Library  #define SERVER "127.0.0.1"   #define BUFLEN 512   #define PORT 9000     int main(void) {     struct sockaddr_in si_other;     int s;      int slen=sizeof(si_other);     char buf[BUFLEN];     char message[BUFLEN];     WSADATA wsa;      //Initialise winsock     printf("\nInitialising Winsock");     if (WSAStartup(MAKEWORD(2,2),&amp;wsa) != 0)     {         printf("Failed.

Thanks</p>
