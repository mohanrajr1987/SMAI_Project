<p>I have this script. I use it not to annoy but to make abusive processes (run by users with few-to-not-at-all consideration to the rest of the users) to timeout and eventually crash in my own network, so the bandwidth is not eaten.</p>  <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python import socket  MSG = "Suck my ****s!! " * 1024 sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)  count = 0  while True:     print "Punch! %d" % count     count += 1     if count == 256:         count = 0     sock.sendto(MSG, ("192.168.255.255", 4321)) </code></pre>  <p>And it worked for months. Almost 1 year I'd say.</p>  <p>However, now I get an error like this:</p>  <pre><code>Punch! 0 Traceback (most recent call last):   File "Escritorio/punch.py", line 14, in &lt;module&gt;     sock.sendto(MSG, ("192.168.255.255", 4321)) socket.error: [Errno 13] Permission denied </code></pre>  <p>(Where the "Punch! 0" is an expected output)</p>  <p>My OS is Ubuntu 12.04, with Python 2.7.3.</p>  <p>What should I check? Even running the script as sudo produces such error.</p>
