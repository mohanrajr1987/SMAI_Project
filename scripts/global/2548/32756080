<p>Let's say i have this context: i'm Listening on 85.222.45.1:1156.</p>  <p>A client, with source Src IP:92.35.21.6 Src Port:6320 send a packet to Dst IP: 85.222.45.1 Dst Port:1156</p>  <p>The server answers to client address Dst IP:92.35.21.6 Dst Port:6320 but from another address, let's say Src IP: 101.344.53.12 Src Port: 1156</p>  <p>Is that possible?</p>  <p>I think that may be possible, only if the application is able to understand what packet belongs to a determined session based on content of UDP packet. So in this case, the only way to connect sessions is based on Port recognition and UDP packet.</p>  <p>What do you think?</p>  <p>EDIT: This happens because of a load balancing configuration. So i was just wondering.</p>
