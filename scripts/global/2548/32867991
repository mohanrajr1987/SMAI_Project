<p>This may seem a bit vague but I'm currently having a strange dilemma with some code and am looking for ideas as to what may be the cause.</p>  <p>I have a Java program that has been running in Linux, receiving data down an Ethernet connection using UDP and plotting it on a graph. This data is correct.</p>  <p>When I run the exact same program, using the exact same cable on Windows the graph data is different, it roughly follows the same pattern but there are some spikes and it simply isn't correct.</p>  <p>I'm looking for ideas as to what may be the problem and how to solve them if possible please?</p>  <p><strong>My initial thoughts are:</strong></p>  <ul> <li>Packets getting lost due to a firewall on the Windows machine</li> <li>Numbers being processed / calculated differently on Linux compared to Windows</li> </ul>  <p>Thank you!</p>
