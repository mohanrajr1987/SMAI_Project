<p>I've recently had this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32769245/access-sharepoint-from-a-worker-role-service-running-on-azure/32779015">issue</a> where an Azure Cloud service worked perfectly when I ran it on my machine (using Azure emulator), but had problems when running the same service on Azure.<br> After reading quite a few articles (like <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/praveenh/archive/2013/04/30/intermittent-quot-http-403-forbidden-quot-error-while-trying-to-browse-to-a-sharepoint-web-app.aspx" rel="nofollow">this</a> and <a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-US/2d5a4339-4de6-478f-acf0-300eb97de632/sharepoint-403-forbidden-error" rel="nofollow">this</a>) I changed ALL the references of my project to Copy Local = true, re-deployed, and it worked.</p>  <p>This made me wonder, when should CopyLocal be set to true on Cloud services?<br> (not a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/602765/when-should-copy-local-be-set-to-true-and-when-should-it-not">duplicate</a>, this question is for Cloud services)</p>  <p>In my case it was a WorkerRole deployed on Azure, but...<br> Are there different criteria depending on which type of project we are developing?<br> Does it change if it's Azure or Amazon or any other?<br> Is there an additional overhead (or something conceptually wrong) if we simply set Copy Local = true to all references?</p>  <p>In the Microsoft <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/hh420322.aspx" rel="nofollow">documentation</a> I found that when migrating an application to the cloud:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The Copy Local property is set to true for any assemblies that are required for MVC 2, MVC 3, MVC 4, and Silverlight Business Applications.</p> </blockquote>  <p>But this doesn't specify when I should set Copy Local true to other references.<br> Thanks in advance</p>
