<p>I am trying to create a mobile app for inventory management purposes. I have been looking around for an app for some time now and none seem to meet my requirements. I have time and the patience to create it but do not know where to start. I need the app to connect to a cloud database so that others can access the information in my group. I just do not know where to start.</p>  <p>I was thinking to use Dreamweaver but not 100% on that. Could someone please suggest a cheap or free solution to create this app. The app will hold over 1000+ records and a minimum of 2 people will be accessing the app in any given time. I would like the app to be compatible with a bluetooth barcode scanner.</p>  <p>If you need further clarification please let me know.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
