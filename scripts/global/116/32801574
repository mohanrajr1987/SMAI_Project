<p>I am searching for a provider from which I can rent massive computing power (particularly CPU-Power). I have already tried a service from Amazon AWS called EC2 namend "c4.8xlarge": </p>  <blockquote>   <p>(132 ECUs, 36 vCPUs, 2.9 GHz, Intel Xeon E5-2666v3, 60 GiB memory, EBS   only)</p> </blockquote>  <p>Unfortunately it only has the computing performance equivalent to my home pc: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>(AMD Phenom 365 4x3.4 GHZ, 4 GB DDR3 RAM)</p> </blockquote>  <p>I need more than ten times of this power and the billing has to be per day/hour/second. Which provider do you recomment?</p>  <p>Other Prerequisites:</p>  <ul> <li>Ubuntu Terminal for managing</li> </ul>  <p>Thank you for your support :)</p>
