<p>I have e.g. three file-servers and want to add a "Transparency-Layer" for filedownloads (one single script which is executed, fetches the file and sends it directly to the user). </p>  <p>Users should only use one link to access a file e.g.:</p>  <pre><code>www.mysite.com/download/&lt;UUID_WITH_correctFileServer&gt; </code></pre>  <p>The questions I am asking now are:</p>  <ul> <li>Is it possible to offer the users a single access-url (e.g. above) with good performance?</li> <li>I think that using just one java-servlet or php-script is not as performant as having one script on each fileserver -> my speculation: file is sent from fileserver to central script and from there to the user. correct?</li> <li>How do other cloud-storage-providers have solved this issue?</li> </ul>
