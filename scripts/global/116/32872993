<p>I've recently modified the /var/log/secure log to test a remote log aggregation tool and that, of course, prevented syslog from further writing to that log.</p>  <p><strong>Question</strong>: How do i restart <code>syslog</code> on this <code>CloudLinux</code> box I have?</p>  <p>I'm used to syslog being under <code>/etc/init.d/syslog</code> for other Linux distros and just a simple restart command does it however on <code>CloudLinux</code> syslog is under <code>/etc/logrotate/syslog</code> and, as far as I could read, it's part of a cron job now or something like that.</p>
