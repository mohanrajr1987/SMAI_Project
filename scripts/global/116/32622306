<p>I am working on an app that uses health data from the iOS HealthKit SDK, and I of course want to have a duplicate of that data for my own server-side analysis.  I know that you can't save HealthKit data in iCloud, and I've read the Apple Developer Guidelines for HealthKit <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#healthkit" rel="nofollow">here</a>, but it doesn't address the use of cloud in general other than iCloud in particular.  Am I allowed to store health data in Parse or another cloud?</p>
