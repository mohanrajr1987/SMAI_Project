<p>As I know both cloud and big data are used to store huge amount of data. So in case of data storing, I do not see any difference. However, I think there is architecture difference as well as the way data is getting stored,processed and retrieved is also difference.</p>  <p>In this question, I wanted to know, what is the real difference (something very technical and internal operation) between these two.</p>  <p>Asking because, one of my trainer said, "cloud is for data storage and Big data is for data analysis", I'm not completely agreed and convinced by this statement. As per my knowledge both can handle real time data analysis (in case of IoT data). And, there are tools available for this(in Apache).</p>  <p>Cloud was present previously which can handle large amount of data...Why Big data came into picture? What extra benefit its giving?</p>  <p>My question may be funny but your answer will give me real things to understand during client facing and requirement gathering and estimation and design.</p>  <p>PLease help. Your honest suggestion may help me to take a better decision, when should I go for cloud and when Big data? Thanks.  </p>
