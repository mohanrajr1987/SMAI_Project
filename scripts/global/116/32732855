<p>I am using following command to list all the objects in the container and dumping into the log file. </p>  <pre><code>swift -A url -U username -K password list container_name&gt; log.txt </code></pre>  <p>I have checked the number of lines in the output log file and it showing the  count  <strong>1076857</strong> . But when I have checked the cloud manually and found the  the count which is showing <strong>1081756</strong>. What might be the reason for this mismatch? Is the above command excludes the empty folder? </p>  <p>Please suggest.</p>
