<pre><code>let params = NSMutableDictionary() params.setObject(fullName.text!.lowercaseString, forKey: "username")  let result: AnyObject? = PFCloud.callFunction("checkUsername", withParameters: params as [NSObject : AnyObject]) </code></pre>  <p>This worked in Xcode 6.3, but now that I update to Swift 2 (Xcode 7) it no longer works. I get the error message:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Call can throw, but it is not marked with 'try' and the error is not handled</p> </blockquote>  <p>How can I resolve this?</p>  <p>Also, I don't want to use <code>PFCloud.callFunctionBackground</code></p>
