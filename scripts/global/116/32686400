<p>I am a personal cloud user, and want to move all my files in Dropbox to Mega since it provides larger free storage space. What I am doing now is to download all the files from dropbox, then upload them to Mega.</p>  <p>I am wondering whether there is a way to let Mega to fetch files directly from my Dropbox after providing authorization. I am open to other cloud if it does not work for Mega.</p>  <p>Or, more generally is it possible to move files between any clouds directly?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
