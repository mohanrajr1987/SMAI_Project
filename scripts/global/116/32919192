<p>I'm struggling to get to grips with Reserved IP addresses in an Azure Cloud Service.</p>  <p>I have a Cloud Service with Staging and Productions deployments and I need at least the Production deployment to have a stable IP address. I set up 2 Reserved IP addresses as described <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/documentation/articles/virtual-networks-reserved-public-ip/" rel="nofollow">here</a> then assigned my reserved IPs to the Production and Staging deployments with Power Shell:</p>  <pre><code>Set-AzureReservedIPAssociation -ReservedIPName MyReservedIP1 -ServiceName mycloudservice -Slot “Production” Set-AzureReservedIPAssociation -ReservedIPName MyReservedIP2 -ServiceName mycloudservice -Slot “Staging” </code></pre>  <p>All well and good the reserved IPs get assigned to the respective instances, the problem is if I delete one of the deployments and redeploy the IP address is not maintained.</p>  <p>I also tried assigning a reserved IP address to the cloud service without specifying a "Slot" and it assigned fine but does not seem to get used in either Production or Staging deployments.</p>  <pre><code>Set-AzureReservedIPAssociation -ReservedIPName MyReservedIP -ServiceName mycloudservice </code></pre>  <p>My usual workflow would be to deploy to Staging then swap with Production once I have tested all is working fine. With this scenario how can I ensure the Production deployment always gets a Reserved IP address?</p>  <p>Also if the Reserved IP address is not maintained after, for example, deleting and redeploying a Production instance how does this differ from the regular VIP that is assigned to the deployment?</p>
