<p>I am new to cloud computing, but had a question if a mechanism as what I am about to describe exists or is possible to create?</p>  <p>Dynamodb has provisioned throughput (eg. 100 writes/second). Of course, in real world application real life throughput is very dynamic and will almost never be your provisioned amount of 100 writes/second. I was thinking what would be great would be some type of queue for dynamodb. For example, my dynamodb during peak hours may receive 500 write requests per second (5 times what I have allocated) and would return errors. Is it there some queue I can put in between the client and database, so the client requests go to the queue, the client gets acknowledged their request has been dealt with, then the queue spits out the request to the dynamodb at a rate of 100/ writes per second exactly, so that way there are no error returned and I don't need to raise the through put which will raise my costs?</p>
