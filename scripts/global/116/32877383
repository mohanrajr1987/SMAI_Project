<p>I am implementing my first application on iOS Parse. In one of the table I have a column called <code>AvailableDate</code>. This column format is date. I have thousand of rows in this table but I only need those with <code>AvailableDate</code> greater than current date. However, I need to keep track of old ones too. </p>  <p>I thought to increase speed I can create another table with same fields. Every time one of the rows <code>AvailableDate</code> is greater than current time, I move it to second table. So I reduce number of rows and increase speed. Now my question is what is the best way to do this? This functionality is not <strong>triggered</strong> by the user. This is a <strong>automatic</strong> server side operation. </p>
