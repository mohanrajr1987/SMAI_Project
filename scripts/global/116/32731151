<p>I am config my system has many branches. I would like to set numbering of Acumatica is generated separately for each branch. Example, in branch 1 I have sales order with nbr is 00001 after that I change to branch 2 and create Sales Order so the needed nbr is 0001.</p>  <p>Thank you in advanced.</p>
