<p>I am designing an application to connect to Azure Batch and run some compute intense jobs on demand for our users. When you create the pool you can specify the OS family and Version of VMs but what I am wondering is can you change this after the pool has been created? </p>  <p>So if I want to reconfigure and change to a different OS family/version, can I do so without destroying my existing pool or is the only way to close the pool and open a new one?</p>
