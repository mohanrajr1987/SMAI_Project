<p>I did some analytics with RHadoop under Cloudera 5.3 but with simple node cluster mode and small dataset.Now I want to move to the cloud(multi-node cluster) for Big Data Analytics(large dataset) but what I find isn't free. Have you an idea about free public Cloud? Thank you for your suggestions!</p>
