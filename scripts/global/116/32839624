<p>I have been hosting my CRM system on a dedicated server from server4you and i'm beginning to see that i need to upgrade to some sort of cloud solution.</p>  <p>By cloud i mean self scaling web-hosting, I'm running a CRM system so that is mostly MySQL, so it doesn't need extreme storage, it needs power to handle all the users calling millions of rows in the datebase.</p>  <p>The reason that i am writing it here is that, i see most of the users here do have experience with bigger solutions and then this might help others out.</p>  <p>Current the servers is based in North Germany, because it is cheaper in Germany than in Denmark where almost all my users are.</p>  <p><strong>What hosting solution do i need for a web-system like this? A solution that can go from 500 users to 10000 without any problems.</strong></p>  <p>Thanks in advance for your help</p>
