<p>I want to create a solution for file serving that can scale-out. And I need to deploy this solution to my own datacenter, not any other cloud/server providers like aws, digital ocean, etc. </p>  <p>I've already developed a simple solution in Java, that can upload file and distribute it between its server list and create e a public url for the file. But I think there should be some better opensource solution that can be freely donwloaded and installed on my own server that do the same and its performance and scalability is proven. I've searched a bit but didn't find any.</p>  <p>EDIT: as i described, I need a solution that can give me 2 features. First, ability to upload a file programmatically and return a url or such thing to track a file record. second do a normal file serving for uploaded file. Be cautious that I need the solution be able to serve it via multiple servers for higher band width and scalability. </p>  <p>Can anyone introduce an opensource/free solution that has these conditions?</p>  <ul> <li>Supports upload of Tens/Hundreds of TBs of static data</li> <li>Easily scale-out and automatically distribute files between servers</li> <li>Easily add new servers</li> <li>Opensource and deployable to our own infrastructure</li> </ul>  <p>thanks in advance</p>
