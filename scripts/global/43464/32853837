<p>I've searched around the web, but have been unable to find a way to <strong>disable</strong> redis-cli from generating the file <em>~/.rediscli_history</em>. My concern is that the file logs AUTH information into the file (more info. here: <a href="https://github.com/antirez/redis/pull/2413" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/antirez/redis/pull/2413</a>). Any ideas on how to do this?</p>
