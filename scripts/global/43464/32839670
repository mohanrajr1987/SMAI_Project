<p>I need to share a large (~70MB) memory object between two different machines (java spring-boot rest service behind a load balancer).</p>  <p>As a first shot I tried to fiddle with Redis <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-a-redis-cluster-on-ubuntu-14-04" rel="nofollow" title="configured master/slave">configured master/slave</a>, configured with <code>slave-read-only no</code>    but still I cannot understand how to configure it in order to write data from the slave:</p>  <pre><code>master$ redis-cli -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6379                  127.0.0.1:6379&gt; set mytest "written by **master**"  slave$ redis-cli -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6379 127.0.0.1:6379&gt; get mytest "written by **master**" </code></pre>  <p>so far not bad but when I write from the slave</p>  <pre><code>slave$ redis-cli -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6379                  127.0.0.1:6379&gt; set mytest "written by **slave**" master$ redis-cli -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6379                  127.0.0.1:6379&gt; get mytest "written by **master**" </code></pre>  <p>Have I misunderstood something?</p>  <p>Is there a better/simplier way to do it?</p>  <p>Is redis the right solution for this issue?</p>
