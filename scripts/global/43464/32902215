<p>I'm building a set of redis nodes (in master-slave pairs), with a series of client nodes in front, with sentinel running on the client nodes. Over time, I expect to client+sentinel nodes to go down. If this happens during a failover, the node restarts with a bad list of masters, and it will not be able to failover the new master node.</p>  <p>How do I prevent sentinels becoming out of sync on startup when they have an out-of-date configuration? Should I always attempt to grab the configs of several other sentinels and compare them, and choose the config that is most common as my new config?</p>
