<p>In the site I'm working on users can submit images (avatars).</p>  <p>When users want to update their images, the uploaded images go to celery were they are be resized, optimized and some thumbnails are also generated.</p>  <p>Only after processing is that images are showed in the site.</p>  <p>I intend to use redis to cache images for a long time and when the process above get completed, I'd like to invalidate the cache just for the uploaded image.</p>  <p>I failed to find docs / tutorials the teach us how to achieve these.</p>  <p>Could someone please point me out some tutorials / docs that explain how to cache images as well as how to invalidate the cache just for a specific image?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
