<p>Is there a resource someone can point me to for solutions on forwarding remote log files to a central log server? These servers are either on our DMZ or remote cloud instances and do not have direct connections back to our LAN. I would prefer some system that will queue data on the end point, and the drain this data when the central log server contacts it (so, I always want to pull data from these servers).</p>  <p>I am setting up central log collector for elasticsearch, kibana, and custom application analysis.</p>  <p>I've looked at various methods to collect, queue, and forward logs like logstash, flume, fluentd, redis, rsyslodg, etc.  However it seems like most of these systems rely on having a direct connection to some central service to push the data into.</p>  <p>I haven't found a clear example of how these various queuing systems can be used to pull log data into a central server / elasticsearch.</p>  <p>Any thoughts? Obviously I could do something custom like rsync or some such, but would prefer to standardize all my machines (internal &amp; external) on a similar messaging standard that I can replicate anywhere as needed.</p>
