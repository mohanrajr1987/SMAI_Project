<p>I have arrays of keys like ["aaa","bbb","ccc"] so I want to delete all these keys from redis using one command . I donot want to iterate using loop . I read about redis command DEL and on terminal redis-client it works but using nodejs it does not work </p>  <pre><code>Redisclient.del(tokenKeys,function(err,count){              Logger.info("count is ",count)              Logger.error("err is ",err)           }) </code></pre>  <p>where tokenKeys=["aaa","bbb","ccc"] , this code is work if I send one key like tokenKeys="aaa"</p>
