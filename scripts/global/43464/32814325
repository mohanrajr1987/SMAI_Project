<p>I know redis can be used as LRU cache, but is there softlimit flag, where we can state after specific criteria is reached "redis will start cleaning LRU items".</p>  <p>Actually I'm getting OOM errors on redis, I've set redis to LRU cache, but it hits OOM limit and application stops.</p>  <p>I know of "maxmemory " flag, but is there a softlimit, where we've some 10% space left, and we can start eviction of some items, so that application doesn't stop !</p>
