<p>Looking the documentation of AWS Elastic Cache I can see they support Redis Cluster and talk about key/value data and Redis operations in general. However is not clear for me if this will support replication of Redis' pub/sub along the different servers.</p>  <p>We are building a chat server on node-xmpp. We will have many application servers for handling chat connections and we are relying on Redis pub/sub for handling the communication between chat threads. We require that regardless the actual Redis instance each chat server is communicating to, they can share the same pub/sub channel.</p>  <p>At <a href="https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/performance-at-scale-with-amazon-elasticache.pdf" rel="nofollow">AWS Elastic cache white paper (page 7) </a> they indicate to use Redis if you want pub/sub. I understand from this that AWS Elastic Cache will actual support pub/sub scalability but I'm not convinced yet.</p>
