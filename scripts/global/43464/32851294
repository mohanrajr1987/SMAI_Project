<p>I just read bout the the HyperLogLog data structure in Redis and I'm curious about real world applications.  The more I use Redis the more I like its simplicity and amazing range of applications.   What are the significant real world applications that we can use HyperLogLog for?</p>  <p>Note:  I'm aware of the post by antirez (antirez.com/news/75) about "count unique thing" but there's a real lack of concrete useful application for HLL.  This question is to start a thread to provide more details on what HLL can be used for.</p>
