<p>I have a redis set. This set can store 20 members maximum(added with<code>SADD</code> command). My problem is ; I need to update that members when needed. Members need that modification maximum 10 times for every member. Set members are json as a string. There is only solutoin on my mind nor, get all members update and recreate that set again. But it seems iditoic.</p>  <p>I know there is <code>ZADD</code> sorted set with its score support it seems suitable also I need to update score like data in json , but i just wonder Is there any method updating members in efficient way, or is updating member not acceptable on redis way ?</p>  <p><em>Note: Redis datastore is using by both node.js and java clients.</em></p>
