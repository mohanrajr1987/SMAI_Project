<p>I am trying to use python redis client to make redis pipeline to call a redis server for some data. This data may exist or not. Even if the data is not existing, I am supposed to receive something like <code>[None, [None]]</code> according what I have read and experimented with python redis client.</p>  <p>However, there are sometimes that I get a empty list back, something like [], which caused exceptions in following (I AM MISSING!) code when I try to parse the returned result list. Moreover, when I retry the same requests manually after I found the issue I cannot reproduce the same problem, the reids server returns me with the correct data or [None, [None]], which is handled by me code.</p>  <p>There is no data written or data change to the redis server at all, only read in my code.</p>  <p>Is there anyone has any idea about what cause this to happen? Since from the logic, this should not happen at all.</p>  <p>By the way, I am using python redis client 2.10.3</p>  <p>Any insight will help. Thanks~!</p>
