<p>I have one Redis instance with 3 databases. I only need to setup cluster failover for just one of these databases. Is this possible? One way how I thought that it might be possible is to create 2 different connections from my Node.JS app. The first connection would be set up as a cluster connection while the other one will be set up as a regular connection. Would this work?</p>
