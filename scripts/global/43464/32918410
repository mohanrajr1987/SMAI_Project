<p>In the tutorial <em>Real-time data analysis with Kubernetes, Redis, and BigQuery on Google Cloud Platform</em>, when I run: <code>$ kubernetes/cluster/kube-up.sh</code>, my terminal shows "Waiting for group to become stable, current operations: creating: 4".  What is the problem? I have waited for the results for just half a day and tried it for several times, but it does't work!</p>
