<p>I'm new to Redis and while reading its transaction on the official site, I'm so confused at one thing.</p>  <ol> <li>It says </li> </ol>  <blockquote>   <p>Either all of the commands or none are processed, so a Redis transaction is also atomic.</p> </blockquote>  <ol start="2"> <li>Then it says</li> </ol>  <blockquote>   <p>even when a command fails, all the other commands in the queue are processed â€“ </p> </blockquote>  <p>So it opposes to one another, doesn't it?</p>
