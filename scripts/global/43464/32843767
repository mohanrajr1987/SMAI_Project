<p>I am using the <a href="https://github.com/taskrabbit/node-resque" rel="nofollow"><code>node-resque</code></a> API as described in the documentation. And every time I perform an enqueue a new client connection as confirmed with <code>CLIENT LIST</code> gets created. Why isn't it possible to do this all over just one connection?</p>  <pre><code>// Initialize in the beginning and making queue globally accessible var queue = new NR.queue({connection: connectionDetails}, jobs); queue.on('error', function(error){ console.log(error); });  // calling this multiple times queue.connect(function(){   queue.enqueue('math', "add", [1,2]);   queue.enqueue('math', "add", [1,2]);   queue.enqueue('math', "add", [2,3]);   queue.enqueueIn(3000, 'math', "subtract", [2,1]); }); </code></pre>  <p>Am I misusing the API or is it a flaw in the API? You would expect that at the end of the the <code>connect</code> block it closes the connection again.</p>
