<p>Please advise me, if there is a better solution. I have single set with ID, and multiple keys with values, for instance:</p>  <pre><code>items --- 121 122 123 </code></pre>  <p>and keys for each set entry:</p>  <pre><code>keys --- item:121 value1 item:122 value2 ... item:123 valueN </code></pre>  <p>What I need to do, is to join set items with values by key into result list.  I can do this using the lua script and for statement.</p>  <p>Or, there is more fancy solution, maybe its better to use single <code>HSET</code> instead of separate keys to store indexed values.</p>
