<p>I am working on a user activity feature in which I track the activity of a user everyday. I am thinking of using bitmap, so users who will be active on that day will be set to 1.</p>  <pre><code>SETBIT users:2015:9:30 &lt;userid&gt; 1 </code></pre>  <p>I don't want to do GETBIT for each user. I want to retrieve the entire value in binary so I can iterate through it and find the active or inactive users.</p>  <p>I would like to know if this approach is correct and which node-module to use.</p>
