<p>I am already using Redis (with Redis Cloud on Heroku) as a data store for Resque to process my background jobs. I would like to add some fragment caching to my app.</p>  <p>Questions:</p>  <ol> <li><p>Do we need two separate instances of Redis to achieve this? One for the fragment caching (ephemeral data) and another for jobs (persistent data)? Or can the one Redis instances be configured to handle both scenarios? </p></li> <li><p>From a configuration and maintenance point of view, is it easier to simply have memcached for fragment caching and Redis for jobs? Is the main downfall to this having two paid services rather than one?</p></li> </ol>
