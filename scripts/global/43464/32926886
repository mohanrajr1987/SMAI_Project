<p>I've installed redis according to <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-redis" rel="nofollow">this tutorial</a>. Everything works fine until I run <code>sudo service redis_6379 start</code> at which point I get the error <code>Failed to start redis_6379.service: Unit redis_6379.service failed to load: No such file or directory. </code> When I check I see that redis is not running:</p>  <pre><code>&gt; sudo service redis_6379 status ‚óè redis_6379.service Loaded: not-found (Reason: No such file or directory) Active: inactive (dead) </code></pre>  <p>I'm not sure what this <code>redis_6379.service</code> file is, or how I can create it? any help?</p>  <p>EDIT: tried installing using <code>sudo apt-get install redis-server</code> and got the following errors:</p>  <pre><code>adduser: Warning: The home directory `/var/lib/redis' does not belong to the user that you are currently creating. insserv: script shlonsky: service nginx already provided! insserv: script unicorn_my_app: service unicorn already provided! insserv: warning: script 'vncserver' missing LSB tags and overrides insserv: There is a loop between service unicorn and vncserver if stopped insserv:  loop involving service vncserver at depth 2 insserv:  loop involving service unicorn at depth 1 insserv: Stopping vncserver depends on unicorn_faisal_lab and therefore on system facility `$all' which can not be true! insserv: exiting now without changing boot order! update-rc.d: error: insserv rejected the script header dpkg: error processing package redis-server (--configure): subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 1 Processing triggers for libc-bin (2.21-0ubuntu4) ...

Errors were encountered while processing:  redis-server E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1) </code></pre>  <p>I created recall creating the scripts <code>shlonsky</code> and <code>unicorn_my_app</code> to start nginx and unicorn, but I didn't think they would affect further .service instillation. any idea what I need to do to allow .service files to install?</p>
