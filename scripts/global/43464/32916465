<p>Using PHPRedis and Apache PHP-FPM I'm using the pconnect() call to re-use connections - its been helpful in past to not let the number of connections creep up too high. However in the case where our primary redis node goes down - we automatically promote the slave to master and the old master becomes read-only. The pconnect() however is still holding a connection to the old maste - so set() commands begin to fail.</p>  <p>What we need is a way to tear down those persistent connections - but short of restarting Apache I can't figure out how to do it. Any ideas?</p>
