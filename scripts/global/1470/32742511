<p>I have a matrix plot produced by the matplotlib library. The size of my matrix is 256x256, and I already have a legend and a colorbar with proper ticks. I cannot attach any image due to my being new to stackoverflow. Anyhow, I use this code to generate the plot:</p>  <pre><code># Plotting - Showing interpolation of randomization plt.imshow(M[-257:,-257:].T, origin='lower',interpolation='nearest',cmap='Blues', norm=mc.Normalize(vmin=0,vmax=M.max())) title_string=('fBm: Inverse FFT on Spectral Synthesis') subtitle_string=('Lattice size: 256x256 | H=0.8 | dim(f)=1.2 | Ref: Saupe, 1988 | Event: 50 mm/h, 15 min') plt.suptitle(title_string, y=0.99, fontsize=17) plt.title(subtitle_string, fontsize=9) plt.show()  # Makes a custom list of tick mark intervals for color bar (assumes minimum is always zero) numberOfTicks = 5 ticksListIncrement = M.max()/(numberOfTicks) ticksList = [] for i in range((numberOfTicks+1)):     ticksList.append(ticksListIncrement * i)   cb=plt.colorbar(orientation='horizontal', format='%0.2f', ticks=ticksList)  cb.set_label('Water depth [m]')  plt.show() plt.xlim(0, 255) plt.xlabel('Easting (Cells)')  plt.ylim(255, 0) plt.ylabel('Northing (Cells)') </code></pre>  <p>Now, being my subtitle too long (3rd line of code in the excerpt reported here), it interferes with the Y axis ticks, and I don't want this. Instead, some of the information reported in the subtitle I would like to be re-routed to a line of text to be placed at the bottom center of the image, under the colorbar label. How can this be done with matplotlib? </p>  <p>Sorry for not being able to attach an image. Thanks.</p>
