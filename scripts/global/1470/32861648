<p>The problem that I have seems pretty easy and obvious, but I couldn't find a way to do it with Cesium. I want to have labels, or info box to show the progress of the problem, so labels are adding to the screen in time (I can have all labels at the beginning of the program and change the color of them by time too). </p>  <ol> <li>I don't know how to create label such that its location only depends on the screen or page (for example top of the page) and not on the position of an object, such as world or cesium widget.  (a kind of position with direct visual representation)</li> <li>To update labels, can I define two intervals with different texts?</li> <li>Can I make my labels as buttons which are appearing sequentially and then for example will change the current time of the program?</li> </ol>  <p>Thanks,</p>
