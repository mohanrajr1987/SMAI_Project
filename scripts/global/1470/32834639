<p>I got this problem for a while. That is about mounting iscsi volume with "-L xxx" parameter(e.g., mount -L xxx /mnt/shared) on another remote node. Steps in detail:</p>  <ol> <li>Having an iscsi disk volume named "/dev/sda" provided by one target on iscsi server;</li> <li>"/dev/sda" is now available on two client node(node1,node2) by connecting iscsi server;</li> <li>On node1, format /dev/sda by: mkfs.ocfs2  -L test -N 3  /dev/sda; Then, succeed in: mount LABEL=test /mnt/shared/;</li> <li>But on node2, failed to: mount LABEL=test /mnt/shared/ and got error message: mount: can't find LABEL=multi-write_append_truncate-test</li> <li>One workaround is to execute "udevadm triger" on node2, then it'll work.</li> </ol>  <p>It seems that the volume change action(formating) cannot be delivered to the kernel of node2. "udevd" have no info about the change to update syslink - volume label. For more details, please refer to bugzilla - <a href="https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=925564" rel="nofollow">https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=925564</a></p>  <p>Hope experts on iscsi and udev stuff could give some comments;-) Was it expected or a bug?</p>
