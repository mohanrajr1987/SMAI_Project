<p>I am developing an app using swift, but I got a strange issue with shadows : </p>  <ol> <li>I have a UITableViewCell with a view (CTA) that I want to underline with a shadow. <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/AUiEB.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/AUiEB.png" alt=""></a></li> <li>The view to be underlined references the correct Outlet in my custom UITableViewCell class (CTA -> CTA View)</li> </ol>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/A2moK.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/A2moK.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <ol start="3"> <li>In my Cell I add a shadow, just like I did for some other views, using this code <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/erlAr.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/erlAr.png" alt="enter image description here"></a> </li> <li><p>The expected result should be a shadow starting with a offset and looking like a bottom border, what I get is this (the shadow should appears between the first line and the second line) : <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/qqhIj.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/qqhIj.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p></li> <li><p>The shadow seems to be applied to the inner views (Label, button, etc) and not the view itself ... First time I see this, I can't figure what is happening and how to fix it.</p></li> </ol>  <p>Have someone already face this ?  What did I miss ? </p>
