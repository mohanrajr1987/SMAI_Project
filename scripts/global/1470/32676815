<p>I want to show posts of only one label in the blog posts section in homepage. But posts of that label shouldn't be filtered only from the homepage. I meant, if I choose to show 7 posts in homepage, there must be 7 posts in home page and they all should be of that chosen label.</p>  <p>I replaced, </p>  <pre><code>&lt;b:include data='post' name='post'/&gt;    </code></pre>  <p>with below code,</p>  <pre><code>&lt;b:loop values='data:post.labels' var='label'&gt;             &lt;b:if cond='data:label.name == &amp;quot;MY LABEL&amp;quot;'&gt;           &lt;b:include data='post' name='post'/&gt;   &lt;/b:if&gt;         &lt;/b:loop&gt; </code></pre>  <p>It filters posts of MY LABEL, but it filters posts from only first 7 posts. So there are always less than 7 posts in posts section in home page. How can I fix this to show first 7 posts of MY LABEL in posts section?</p>
