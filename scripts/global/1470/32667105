<p>I have 20+ iPhone/iPad apps that support iOS 7 and up. I ran one of the apps on my iPad Air 1 running iOS 9.0, and the UI is now completely messed up. Labels have been updated to "San Francisco," and it looks like lines are double spaced. This has affected over 20 of my apps.</p>  <p>I fired up Xcode 7.0 and found my font "Heiti SC Lite" has been removed. </p>  <p>My question is, should I search the internet for the Heiti font and try to install it, or change the UI of all of my apps to use a new built in font?</p>  <p>I really do not want to spend countless hours updating the UI. My apps are reading apps, so everything is text based. </p>
