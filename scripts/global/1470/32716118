<p>I would like to draw a line binding a entity to its label with an offset. CesiumJS allows to offset the label, however its not possible to draw a line (or polyline) from a position to an offset like the red line in this image.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/jMOEc.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/jMOEc.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>How can i do it? any sugestion?</p>  <p>i'm using pixel offset. but there is no problem to use eye offset</p>  <pre><code> labels.add({         position: Cesium.Cartesian3.fromDegrees(-75.1641667, 29.9522222),         text: 'Another label',         pixelOffset: new Cesium.Cartesian2(100,-100)      }); </code></pre>
