<p>I am creating a VB.net program where kids can answer exercises on multiplication. I have a problem cause my professor wants me to print the results of the exercises where the kids answer 10 randomized multiplication problems . the summary which he wants me to create should contain the questions, the kid's answer to every question, and if it is wrong, the correct answer should also be prompted. the problem is, the questions are randomly generated integers displayed at the same label control, how am I gonna call every question if that's the case? well, that's just the first problem. my second problem is about radio buttons, see, there are three difficulty levels, the easy, medium, and hard level. every difficulty level has 10 questions. what I want to happen is that when a kid finishes answering one level, the radiobutton that corresponds to it should be disabled. here's the picture for my problem to make sense to you .  <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/9LUJd.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/9LUJd.png" alt="multiplication exercise"></a></p>  <p>and the summary must be contained on a different form.</p>
