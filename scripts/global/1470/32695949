<p>I have some data that consists of three columns - a code, a result, and a category. I want to create a stacked bar chart that has one 'bar' for each unique category, with the 'bar' actually being a list of the codes, color coded by result. Essentially a stacked bar chart with text instead of bars.  If this is not possible, I'd like to create tables of the codes, color-coded by result (which also may not be possible in R).</p>  <p>Data ex:</p>  <pre><code> code&lt;-c("ABC1","ABC2","ABC3","DEF1","DEF2","ABC2","ABC2","XYZ5")  result&lt;-c("Correct","Incorrect","Correct","Blank","Out of date","Correct","Incorrect","Blank")  category&lt;-c("Cat","Cat","Cat","Cat","Dog","Dog","Dog","Fish")  x&lt;-cbind(code,result,category)  x  code   result        category [1,] "ABC1" "Correct"     "Cat"    [2,] "ABC2" "Incorrect"   "Cat"    [3,] "ABC3" "Correct"     "Cat"    [4,] "DEF1" "Blank"       "Cat"    [5,] "DEF2" "Out of date" "Dog"    [6,] "ABC2" "Correct"     "Dog"       [7,] "ABC2" "Incorrect"   "Dog"    [8,] "XYZ5" "Blank"       "Fish"   </code></pre>  <p>edit: here's a poorly done example of what I'm thinking. (where green is correct, red is incorrect, grey is blank, purple is out of date) <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/nBTMS.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/nBTMS.png" alt="example"></a></p>
