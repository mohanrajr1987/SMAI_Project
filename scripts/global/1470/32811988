<p>I only want to show labels for the vertices that have a degree greater than 50. I've tried the following code :</p>  <p><code>plot(g, vertex.label=(V(g)$id[which(degree &gt; 50)]))</code></p>  <p>But rather than only labeling the desired vertices, it seems to relabel all vertices using only the labels for those with a degree greater than 50.</p>  <p>How can I display a plot that only labels the desired vertices? Or is there a way to hide the undesired labels?</p>
