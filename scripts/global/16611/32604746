<p>I want to extract data from my fillable PDF form and print it. I am using Itextsharp in C# to achieve it. I have created one custom button and I am binding the JavaScript to that button using <code>app.execMenuItem()</code>. Many built-in functions are provided through that, such as <strong>Print</strong> and <strong>SaveAs</strong>. I want a function to <strong>PrintOnlyData</strong> of my form. Please suggest some function or JavaScript to extract and print data of my PDF form without the fields</p>
