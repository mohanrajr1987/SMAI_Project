<p>I'm using iText (iTextSharp version 5.5.7) and I am creating a PdfPTable where the data in the rows is sorted.  To give a specific example, say my data looks like this (including my headers - h1, h2, and h3):</p>  <pre><code>+---+---+---+ |h1 |h2 |h3 | +---+---+---+ | A | B | C | +---+---+---+ | A | B | D | +---+---+---+ | A | E | F | +---+---+---+ | K | G | H | +---+---+---+ | K | G | I | +---+---+---+ | K | G | J | +---+---+---+ </code></pre>  <p>I've got that working, and then I started setting the Rowspan property of PdfPCell so I can avoid printing repeated text.  That's also working great, what I get is this:</p>  <pre><code>+---+---+---+ |h1 |h2 |h3 | +---+---+---+ | A | B | C | |   |   +---+ |   |   | D | |   +---+---+ |   | E | F | +---+---+---+ | K | G | H | |   |   +---+ |   |   | I | |   |   +---+ |   |   | J | +---+---+---+ </code></pre>  <p>The problem is, I hit page breaks, and what I see is this:</p>  <pre><code>+---+---+---+ |h1 |h2 |h3 | +---+---+---+ | A | B | C | |   |   +---+ |   |   | D | |   +---+---+ |   | E | F | +---+---+---+ | K | G | H | +---+---+---+  Page Break  +---+---+---+ |h1 |h2 |h3 | +---+---+---+ |   |   | I | |   |   +---+ |   |   | J | +---+---+---+ </code></pre>  <p>What I want, is that when that second page starts, I want the spanned cells (in this case 'K' and 'G') to be re-printed so the user has some idea what's going on.</p>  <p>What I need is similar to a HeaderRow, but what I need the header row to be changes as the rows are emitted.</p>  <p>Any ideas on how to make this work?</p>
