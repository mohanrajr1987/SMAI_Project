<p>How do I prevent anyone from removing a watermark added to an existing PDF document.</p>  <p>The code samples about "How to add a watermark to a PDF file" are plenty here, but in short I read a PDF into a memory stream (MS), pass the MS to the Watermark routine, using PdfStamper with FormFlattening = true and save the MS to file. Perfect watermark each time.</p>  <p>However when opening the PDF in Acrobat or PhantomPdf, the watermark is an object over the existing PDF document that can be altered or removed and is not fused into the PDF.</p>  <p>How do I fuse the layers of the PDF together to create an unremovable watermark on an existing PDF document?</p>
