<p>I have some <code>PdfTemplate</code> and I want to clip its shape to some path. I know how to do this, but the clipping line is always the same (probably 1 px) and I want to be able to change it. Is there any way to do this? Half-measures, like resizing template will not do the trick.</p>  <p>Piece of code:</p>  <pre><code>PdfTemplate template = contentByte.CreateTemplate(100, 200); template.MoveTo(0, 0); template.LineTo(50, 50); template.LineTo(50, 0); template.LineTo(0, 50); template.SetLineWidth(5); template.Clip(); Image img = Image.getInstance(RESOURCE); template.Add(img, 0, 0); </code></pre>  <p><code>SetLineWidth()</code> obviously doesn't work. Both C# and Java answers will help.</p>  <p>Edit: In this scenario we have img in triangle. What if we want to clip this image like this, but without changing coordinates (I would like to set line width on 10):</p>  <pre><code>template.LineTo(45, 45); template.LineTo(45, 0); template.LineTo(0, 45); </code></pre>
