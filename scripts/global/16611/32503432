<p>So I've been using itextsharp to create and download a file to the client. The PDF is created, but is created using the wrong file extension. It is downloaded as "webform1.aspx" But if I change the file extension it is correct. I need to learn how to change the file name when downloading using the memory stream, or a different method if needed. Code below, it is executed via a button on a blank webform. </p>  <pre><code>protected void Button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)     {         // Create a Document object         Document document = new Document(PageSize.A4, 50, 50, 25, 25);          // Create a new PdfWriter object, specifying the output stream         MemoryStream output = new MemoryStream();         PdfWriter writer = PdfWriter.GetInstance(document, output);          // Open the Document for writing         document.Open();         // Create a new Paragraph object with the text, "Hello, World!"         var welcomeParagraph = new Paragraph("Hello, World!");          // Add the Paragraph object to the document         document.Add(welcomeParagraph);         document.Close();         Response.ContentType = "pdf/application";         Response.BinaryWrite(output.ToArray());     } </code></pre>
