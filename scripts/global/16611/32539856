<p>I have a table that has two columns "book" and "author" for example. The book named "Life of Justin" and the author is "Kenny San". When I read from a pdf file, I was returned a string "Life of Justin Kenny San". I couldnt know which the book name, and the author was. I think reading per cell will be helpful but I have searched for days and cannot find a solution.</p>  <p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false"> <div class="snippet-code"> <pre class="snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override"><code>for (int i = 1; i &lt;= reader.NumberOfPages; i++)             {                 string page = "";                  page = PdfTextExtractor.GetTextFromPage(reader, i);                 string[] lines = page.Split('\n');                 foreach (string line in lines)                 {                      MessageBox.Show(line);                 }             }</code></pre> </div> </div> </p>  <p>Above is the code I used but it returned per line instead of per cell. How can I do this? Thanks in advance for your help.</p>
