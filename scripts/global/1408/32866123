<p><em>Edited to be clearer.</em></p>  <p>If for example I have this IQueryable:</p>  <pre><code>DateTime theDate = new DateTime(2015, 09, 30);  var query = from org in Organisations             where org.DisableOrganisation == false &amp;&amp;               org.DisableReports == false             select new             {                 OrganisationId = org.OrganisationId             }; </code></pre>  <p>and later in the method I want to add an OR to it, e.g.</p>  <pre><code>// Check to see if the date is the last day of the month. if (theDate.AddDays(1).Day == 1) {     // The following statement introduces an AND but I want to make this an OR.     query = query.Where(x =&gt; x.Frequency == "M"); } </code></pre>  <p>This effectively makes my query...</p>  <pre><code>var query = from org in Organisations             where org.DisableOrganisation == false &amp;&amp;               org.DisableReports == false &amp;&amp;               org.Frequency == "M"             select new             {                 OrganisationId = org.OrganisationId             }; </code></pre>  <p>but I want to make it...</p>  <pre><code>var query = from org in Organisations             where (org.DisableOrganisation == false &amp;&amp;               org.DisableReports == false) ||               org.Frequency == "M"             select new             {                 OrganisationId = org.OrganisationId             }; </code></pre>  <p>How do I go about making this an OR instead of an AND ?</p>  <p><strong>P.S.</strong> Cannot use PredicateBuilder as it is essentially LinqKit which has a dependency of EntityFramework (â‰¥ 6.0.2), I'm stuck using EF 4.3.1</p>  <p><strong>SOLVED:</strong> Thanks to D Stanley (To be honest I had used this form of solution before, I simply forgot about it).</p>  <pre><code>DateTime theDate = new DateTime(2015, 09, 30); bool isEndOfMonth = theDate.AddDays(1).Day == 1;  var query = from org in Organisations             where (org.DisableOrganisation == false &amp;&amp;               org.DisableReports == false) ||               (isEndOfMonth &amp;&amp;                pr.ProfileType == "L" &amp;&amp;                 pr.Frequency == "M")             select new             {                 OrganisationId = org.OrganisationId             }; </code></pre>
