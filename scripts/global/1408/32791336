<p>I'm struggling writing a query in Entity Framework that deals with a many to many relationship that I have set up. What I want to do is get the items from TableA that belong to a relationship with TableB and at the same time know from the results which relationship was a correct match.</p>  <p>For instance, if I'm using Students and Courses, I want to look for all the students that are in a set of courses and also return only those courses that matched. I very specifically want to start the query with Students, as this can easily be accomplished by just looking at the Courses navigation property to get the list of students.</p>  <p>What I want is a list of Students where each Student contains only the set of Courses in my query (NOT every course the student is taking). </p>  <p>Something like the below is close, I get the correct list of Students, but the navigation property for Courses shows all Courses, not the subset from my query. I want to avoid having to query again if possible, and just return the set of Students / Courses I need.</p>  <pre><code>Dim listOfStudents = From s In Students                                  From c In s.Courses                                  Where listOfCourseIds.Contains(c.CourseId) </code></pre>
