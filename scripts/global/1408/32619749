<p>I have these two properies set in my DbMigrationsConfiguration for Linq to entities:</p>  <pre><code>AutomaticMigrationsEnabled = true; AutomaticMigrationDataLossAllowed = false; </code></pre>  <p>They are hardcoded in the constructor. This worked fine, but now when I want to deploy to production I want these values to be changed. Typically I would put these in the web.config, but I am not sure how best to do this.</p>  <p>Does anyone have any advise on how to get these out of code and into config?</p>
