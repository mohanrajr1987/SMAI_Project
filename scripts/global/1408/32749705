<p>I have an array like this</p>  <pre><code>string[] Reportable = { "1", "3", "5" }; </code></pre>  <p>I have a table Products in my database with a column PartNumber and I can get all partNumbers with e.g value 2 like this.</p>  <pre><code>var result = db.Products.ToList().Where(product =&gt; product.PartNumber == 2); </code></pre>  <p>But I want to get all values from the database that match values in my array Reportable. Eg if my table look like this</p>  <pre><code>ID   Name   PartNumber 1    Name1  1 2    Name2  1 3    Name3  2 4    Name4  3 5    Name5  4 6    Name3  5 </code></pre>  <p>The result from my query should be rows with id 1,2,4,6 because I don't have number 2 and 4 in my array.</p>  <p>Edit</p>  <p>I'am trying to get all PartNumbers that starts with a number in the Reportable array, not only exact match. If I have the number 20 in my array, valid numbers from the query would be e.g 2010, 20221, 20 and 20111 but not e.g 25111, 10333, 11000. I have found the extension method StartsWith() but I do not get it to work.</p>
