<p>I have this Linq To Entites query below. When I execute this query from a Console Application, it produces SQL and executes perfectly.</p>  <p>But when I execute it from a web application, I get an error message that says the Min() function is not recognized by Linq To Entites and it cannot be translated to a store expression.</p>  <p>It is EXACTLY the same query. Both project have the same settings (concerning EF 6) in their config files, and they reference the same assemblies.</p>  <pre><code>from ce in db.CustomEvents where ce.fld_start &gt; DateTime.Now group ce by ce.fld_ownerId into g select new {     fld_ownerId = g.Key,     next_appointement_date = g.Min(i =&gt; i.fld_start) } </code></pre>  <p>It seems this happens only when the Min aggregate is on DateTime property. I hadn't this issue when I had Min on decimals, for instance.</p>  <p>The error message I get when I execute this in the web site is this</p>  <pre><code>LINQ to Entities does not recognize the method 'System.Nullable`1[System.DateTime] Min[CustomEvent](System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable`1[CustomEvent], System.Func`2[CustomEvent,System.Nullable`1[System.DateTime]])' method, and this method cannot be translated into a store expression. </code></pre>  <p>But when I execute it from the Console app, it successfully generates the SQL statement below</p>  <pre><code>SELECT 1 AS [C1], [GroupBy1].[K1] AS [fld_ownerId], [GroupBy1].[A1] AS [C2] FROM ( SELECT     [Extent1].[fld_ownerId] AS [K1],     MIN([Extent1].[fld_start]) AS [A1]     FROM [dbo].[mtbl_CustomEvent] AS [Extent1]     WHERE [Extent1].[fld_start] &gt; (SysDateTime())     GROUP BY [Extent1].[fld_ownerId] )  AS [GroupBy1] </code></pre>  <p>Does anyone have a clue on what is happening?? Why the same query generates SQL when run in the console app, but fails with an exception when run in the web site??</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>  <p>It seems that the problem was an ambiguity between two different implementations of <code>Min&lt;T&gt;(this IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;)</code> (.net's implementation, and our own implementation). Removing the "using OurLibrary;" namespace from the file fixed the problem.</p>
