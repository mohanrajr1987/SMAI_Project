<p>I have seen a few answers to similar questions, however I cannot seem to work out how to apply the answer to my issue.</p>  <pre><code>var allposts = _context.Posts             .Include(p =&gt; p.Comments)             .Include(aa =&gt; aa.Attachments)             .Include(a =&gt; a.PostAuthor)             .Where(t =&gt; t.PostAuthor.Id == postAuthorId).ToList(); </code></pre>  <p>Attachments can be uploaded by the Author (type Author) or Contributor (type Contributor). What I want to do, is only get the Attachments where the owner of the attachment is of type Author.</p>  <p>I know this doesn't work and gives an error:</p>  <pre><code>.Include(s=&gt;aa.Attachments.Where(o=&gt;o.Owner is Author)) </code></pre>  <p>I've read about Filtered Projection here </p>  <p>EDIT - link to article: : <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/alexj/archive/2009/10/13/tip-37-how-to-do-a-conditional-include.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/alexj/archive/2009/10/13/tip-37-how-to-do-a-conditional-include.aspx</a>, </p>  <p>but I just can't get my head around it.</p>  <p>I don't want to include the filter in the final where clause as I want ALL posts, but I only want to retrieve the attachments for those posts that belong to the Author.</p>  <p>EDIT 2: - Post schema requested</p>  <pre><code>public abstract class Post : IPostable {      [Key]     public int Id { get; set; }      [Required]     public DateTime PublishDate { get; set; }      [Required]     public String Title { get; set; }      [Required]     public String Description { get; set; }      public Person PostAuthor { get; set; }     public virtual ICollection&lt;Attachment&gt; Attachments { get; set; }     public List&lt;Comment&gt; Comments { get; set; } } </code></pre>
