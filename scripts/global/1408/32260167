<p>I have a table which has startdate (in format "yyyymmddhhss")and the corresponding entity attribute is string type. I would like to use LINQ To SQL get all the records with StartDate >= SelectedStartDate. Since this table has more than 10 million records, I need to use pagination as well.</p>  <p>Could anyone please suggest on how to implement this/</p>  <p>Regards,</p>  <p>Raaj</p>
