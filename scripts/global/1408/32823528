<p><strong>I have a simple user with following feilds----</strong></p>  <pre><code>   public class User     {        public User()       {        this.Posts = new HashSet&lt;Post&gt;();        }     [Key]     public int UserId { get; set; }     public string UserName { get; set; }     public string Password { get; set; }     piblic int point {get; set;}     public virtual ICollection&lt;Post&gt; Posts { get; set; }     } } </code></pre>  <p><strong>then, i have a post table corresponding to user something like this---</strong></p>  <pre><code> public class Post  {     public Post()    {       public int PostId { get; set; }       public string Message { get; set; }       public int PostedBy { get; set; }       public virtual User User { get; set; }    }  } </code></pre>  <p><strong>now, There is a one to many relationship between user and posts table. 1 user can have multiple posts.Now, i want to increase user's points based on user's post increment in posts Table.Suppose, a user posted 5 posts on some issues then i want to increment his points from 0 to 25 means on per posts, an increment of 5.</strong> What i have tried so far is this query-----</p>  <pre><code>    from p in Posts     join u in UserProfiles     on p.PostedBy equals u.UserId     where p.PostedBy == 1     group p by p.PostedBy into dups      let totalcount = dups.Count()     select totalcount </code></pre>  <p>1>Now, i would like to assign this total count value(output) to User's point column in the UserProfilesTable and save that value to the database. Many many thanks in advance!!!</p>
