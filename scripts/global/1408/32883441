<p><strong>When using Linq to Entities, the resulting query should run on sql server (not enumerating it into memory and then perform the conversion)</strong></p>  <p>I currently have a <a href="http://ninjanye.github.io/SearchExtensions/" rel="nofollow">project</a> whereby I build expression trees for string searching.  I am currently exploring the possibility of <strong>converting non string properties to strings</strong> to enable searching on primitive types, such as <code>integer</code> and <code>Guid</code> etc.</p>  <p>I currently try to <code>Convert</code> a supplied lamda property to a string and then swap it into the expression tree using the following:</p>  <pre><code>var stringProperty = Expression.Convert(property.Body, typeof (string)); </code></pre>  <blockquote>   <p>System.InvalidOperationException : No coercion operator is defined between types 'System.Int32' and 'System.String'.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Am I trying to achieve the impossible or is there a way to <strong>extend linq to entities</strong> to support conversions? </p>
