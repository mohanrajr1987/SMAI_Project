<p>Using LinqPad I have mapped XML to database entities, entities provided by LinqPad.<br> After mapping all the data, I now have over 5 million entities in memory. I am transferring 1000 entities at a time via batch insert (<code>InsertAllOnSubmit</code>). But its hovering over 10 seconds per SubmitChanges().<br> To transfer all 5 million records, it looks like a day or more.  How can I optimise this, so it happens faster?</p>
