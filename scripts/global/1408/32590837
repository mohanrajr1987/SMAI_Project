<p>Using Linq to Entities I need to filter an my entity set based on a list of complex objects that represent criteria.  For example:</p>  <pre><code>var criteria = new[] { new { FirstName = "Bob", LastName = "Smith" }, new { FirstName = "Jane", LastName = "Doe" } }; </code></pre>  <p>I am try to do the following:</p>  <pre><code>var filtered = PersonEntities.where(person =&gt; criteria.Any(c =&gt; c.FirstName == person.FirstName &amp;&amp; c.LastName == person.LastName)).ToList(); </code></pre>  <p>This results in an error due to the query builder not being able to process the complex object.  I know that if I had an Id value to filter on, I could simply select it into an in-memory list and replace the complex object with it in the linq query criteria.  However I have not been able to find a solution when multiple fields are required in the criteria.  Any ideas?</p>
