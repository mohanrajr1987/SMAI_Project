<p>I was surprised today to discover that</p>  <pre><code>A = {1,2,3} </code></pre>  <p>and</p>  <pre><code>B = {1,2,3,} </code></pre>  <p>are both valid syntax in MATLAB. I would have expected the second statement to yield an error. As best as I can tell, they produce identical cell arrays (<code>all([A{:}]==[B{:}])</code> returns true).</p>  <p><strong>Is  there a reason the second syntax is allowed? Is this a bug in the parser? Are <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> truly the same?</strong></p>  <p>Intriguingly, the following is <em>not</em> allowed:</p>  <pre><code>C = {1,2,3,,,} </code></pre>
