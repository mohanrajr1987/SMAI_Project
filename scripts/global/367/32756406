<p>I mean for example the following. I start to type "if" and xCode suggests:</p>  <pre><code>if (...) { ... } else { ... } </code></pre>  <p>and I need:</p>  <pre><code>if (...) { ... } else { ... } </code></pre>  <p>Yes, I know that something similar was already asked but show me at least one solution which works in xcode 6/7. It seems all the previous answers are related to previous xcode versions and don't work now.</p>
