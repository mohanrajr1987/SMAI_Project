<p>I have a problem on my website.</p>  <p>When I want to reply a ticket if I use somewhere the the symbol ' it shows:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that   corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use   near '''', now())' at line 2</p> </blockquote>  <p>Is there a way to edit something on the PHP form of the "ticket reply" so I could type words like "it's" and words with the ' symbol.  </p>
