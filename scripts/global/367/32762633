<p>I have noticed this unexpected feature:</p>  <pre><code>foo &lt;- list(whatever=1:10) </code></pre>  <p>Now, the following works as well:</p>  <pre><code>foo$wha foo$w foo$whateve </code></pre>  <p>However, the following does not:</p>  <pre><code>foo[["wha"]] </code></pre>  <p>This has the unexpected consequences (unexpected for me, that is) that if you have two potential names, like "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CXCL1">CXCL1</a>" and "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CXCL11">CXCL11</a>", and you want to know whether CXCL1 is not null by inspecting <code>!is.null(foo$CXCL1)</code>, it will return TRUE even if CXCL1 null, but CXCL11 isn't.</p>  <p>My questions are:</p>  <ol> <li>How does that work?</li> <li>What is the difference between <code>foo$whatever</code> and <code>foo[["whatever"]]</code>?</li> <li>Why would anyone want this behavior and how do I disable it?</li> </ol>
