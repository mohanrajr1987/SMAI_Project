<p>I'm trying to write a program that accepts user input for their full name and their gender (m/f).</p>  <pre><code>import java.util.Scanner; public class CSCD210Lab2 { // class declaration  public static void main(String[]args) { // main method     Scanner userInput = new Scanner(System.in); // scanner object for console input     System.out.print("Enter Your Full Name: ");     String fullName;     fullName = userInput.next( );      System.out.print = fullName; // print user input     } } </code></pre>  <p>At the moment, I only have the code for the user entering their name. I wanted to make sure the fullName variable was being stored, so I tried to have the console print whatever the user typed. However, I'm getting a syntax error on the <code>System.out.print = fullName;</code>. It gives me this error message:</p>  <pre><code>CSCD210Lab2.java:12: error: cannot find symbol       System.out.print = fullName;                 ^   symbol:   variable print   location: variable out of type PrintStream   1 error </code></pre>  <p>What am I doing wrong here?</p>
