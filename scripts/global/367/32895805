<p>I don't really know how to call them but when looking at others' source code I frequently see this: </p>  <pre><code>side = backFace ? WEST   : EAST; mask[n++] = (0    &lt;= x[d]      ? f(x[0],      x[1],      x[2])      : false)!=       (x[d] &lt;  dims[d]-1 ? f(x[0]+q[0], x[1]+q[1], x[2]+q[2]) : false); </code></pre>  <p>when variables are mentioned, what does the <code>?</code> and <code>:</code> mean? For some reason I never learned about these and never fully understood what they mean, does it have something to do with the value of the variable? </p>  <p>also if someone knows their official name i would gladly correct the title...</p>
