<p>I am new at python, and I am having problems with the use of sep=. What I want to do is to not have a space between the number <code>25</code> and the <code>.</code></p>  <p>Here is my code and the error I get. I am running this code on MAC OSX El Capitan's Terminal.</p>  <p>code:</p>  <pre><code>side = 5 area = side * side print "The area of a square with side ",side,"is ",area,".",sep=" "  </code></pre>  <p>Output:</p>  <pre><code>print "The area of a square with side ",side,"is ",area,".",sep=" "                                                                 ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax </code></pre>
