<p>Hello I have a bunch of do while statements for a program I was making and each of them have a different setMethod defined in another class however I would want to do this in a much more compact way. I was wondering if some sort of loop could do this or not. Or if you could have an array of setMethod. Or anything  that would make this code compact.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>contestant1 is an object of the class contestant information which contains the set methods for each field.</p> </blockquote>  <pre><code>do {     try {         flag = false;         System.out.println("Please enter your first name.");         String firstName = Scanner.nextLine();         contestant1.setName(firstName);     } catch (InvalidInputException e) {         System.out.println(e.getMessage());         flag = true;     } } while (flag);  do {     try {         flag = false;         System.out.println("Please enter your last name.");         String lastName = Scanner.nextLine();         contestant1.setLastName(lastName);     } catch (InvalidInputException e) {         System.out.println(e.getMessage());         flag = true;     } } while (flag);  do {     try {         flag = false;         System.out.println("Please enter your street number.");         String streetNumber = Scanner.nextLine();         contestant1.setStreetNumber(streetNumber);     } catch (InvalidInputException e) {         System.out.println(e.getMessage());         flag = true;     } } while (flag); </code></pre>
