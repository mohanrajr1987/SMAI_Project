<p>So basically "answer" keeps giving me a syntax error, I can not figure it out, I've tried everything, even indentation looks alright. this is a program that will display a 10 question math test, then display right answers and average </p>  <pre><code>import random  def main():     print("\t\tWelcome to your Math Test on Addition\n")     print("You will be asked to answer 10 Math equations\n")      name = input("Enter your name:")      right = 0     counter = 0     answer = 0     average = 0      while counter &lt; 10:         num1 = random.randint(1, 500)         num2 = random.randint(1, 500)          studAnsw = int(input(num1,"+",num2,"=")           answer = int(num1 + num2)          if answer == studAnswer:            right = right +1          counter = counter + 1      print("You have",right,"answers")     getAverage(right)   def getAverage(right):  #it has to show percentage and real     average = right/10     avgPrcnt = average*100                           print("Your average score is:",average ,avgPrcnt)                           return average  </code></pre>
