<p>I can't understand why I need to "force unwrap" variable type in it's declaration in my tests.</p>  <p>Let me give you an example to be more clear:</p>  <pre><code>class testSomething: XCTestCase {    var mockService: MockService!    override func setUp() {     mockService = MockService()   }   ... </code></pre>  <p>So the goal obviously is to create a fresh instance of the mock service every time I run the test. I just don't understand why I need to declare this variable as <code>MockService!</code> type. What does the exclamation point after type really mean in this context?</p>  <p>Just to be clear, when I declare <code>mockService: MockService</code> Xcode complains that my test class does not have initializers</p>
