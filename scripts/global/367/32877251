<p>I want to create a readme.md file for my GitHub but not really sure how to populate it with the correct syntax in order for it to display correctly. Would anyone know if there is a site with tutorials on how to populate the readme.md with the correct synatx? Or additionally, is it acceptable to replace the readme.md file with another format like html.</p>
