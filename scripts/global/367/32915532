<p>I'm working on some PHP that will create a folder every time a request is made to my server.  I can't seem to get my syntax proper. If I just used the $date variable it works no problem, however when I add the "clean" folder before it, it won't create the folder.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php  $time = $_SERVER['REQUEST_TIME']; $date =  date(Ymd_Hms, $time); $new =  "clean/".$date;  echo $new;  if(!is_dir ($new)) {     mkdir($new); }  ?&gt; </code></pre>
