<p>I am struggling with the correct syntax for iterating through an array to pass properties (and number of items) to an external JS constructor function.</p>  <p>The syntax for the constructor is:</p>  <pre><code>`swal.withForm({  formFields: [           { id: 'X', type:'Y', name:'Z', value:''},           {etc...} ] })` </code></pre>  <p>But let's say that the number of formFields is dynamic, and they are stored in an array. How can I iterate through that inside the constructor function? Or is there a way to "paste" the externally created syntax into the function?</p>  <p>Hope this question makes sense.</p>
