<p>I am wanting to do a counter that iterates over 3 states.  I know how to do this for 2 states using the bit operator <code>i^=1</code>.</p>  <p>I want to know if there is a way to do similiar but with three states?</p>  <p>I realize I can just do:</p>  <pre><code>i = 0 while    if(i==3)        i = 0    do stuff here    i++ </code></pre>  <p>But I was hoping for something more elegant and efficient.  I was thinking of a modulus trick or something.</p>  <p>(Right now I am using python)</p>
