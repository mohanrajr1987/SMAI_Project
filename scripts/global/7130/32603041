<p>[SOLVED]</p>  <p>I have 4 buttons, each with a flashing opacity animation that I have rigged up to play when the button is clicked. However when a second button is playing, the one first clicked, still plays and flashes on. And that continues when more buttons are clicked. I have tried using loops, animation components rather than animators and a few other methods. Here is the code, could someone please tell me how I can stop the animation playing when another button is pressed?</p>  <pre><code>public EnemyBehavior enemyBehavior;     public bool[] difficultySelected;      public Animator easy;     public Animator normal;     public Animator hard;     public Animator expert;      public void DifficultySelected(int name){         difficultySelected[0] = false;         difficultySelected[1] = false;         difficultySelected[2] = false;         difficultySelected[3] = false;         difficultySelected[name] = true;     }      void Start () {      }      void Update () {         if(difficultySelected[0] == true){             enemyBehavior.shotsPerSecond = 0.2f;             easy.Play("Difficulty");         }else if(difficultySelected[1] == true){             enemyBehavior.shotsPerSecond = 0.5f;             normal.Play("Difficulty");         }else if(difficultySelected[2] == true){             enemyBehavior.shotsPerSecond = 1;             hard.Play("Difficulty");         }else if(difficultySelected[3] == true){             enemyBehavior.shotsPerSecond = 2;             expert.Play("Difficulty");         }     } </code></pre>  <p>Update:</p>  <pre><code>if(difficultySelected[0] == true){             enemyBehavior.shotsPerSecond = 0.2f;             normal.StopPlayback();             hard.StopPlayback();             expert.StopPlayback();             easy.Play("Difficulty");         }else if(difficultySelected[1] == true){             enemyBehavior.shotsPerSecond = 0.5f;             easy.StopPlayback();             hard.StopPlayback();             expert.StopPlayback();             normal.Play("Difficulty");         }else if(difficultySelected[2] == true){             enemyBehavior.shotsPerSecond = 1;             easy.StopPlayback();             normal.StopPlayback();             expert.StopPlayback();             hard.Play("Difficulty");         }else if(difficultySelected[3] == true){             enemyBehavior.shotsPerSecond = 2;             easy.StopPlayback();             normal.StopPlayback();             hard.StopPlayback(); </code></pre>
