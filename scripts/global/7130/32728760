<p>On a mobile device, when a hyperlink is clicked, a blue box appears for a brief second. It doesn't matter if the hyperlink is text or an image, it still appears. Is there a way to turn this off? </p>  <p>I don't want to turn it off on all items. I just have some hyperlinks embedded in none rectangular images and i think it looks ugly.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
