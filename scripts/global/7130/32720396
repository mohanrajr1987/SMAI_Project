<p>I am having a parent div</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div id='thumb'&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I then have a Javascript that is running a for..loop and appends child divs inside that one depending on a number. So let's say I want 3 new divs, my loop is appending one by one giving them a class name.</p>  <p>At the end I have:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div id='thumb'&gt;     &lt;div class='newTumb1'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    /*this div was created in loop 1*/     &lt;div class='newTumb2'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    /*this div was created in loop 2*/     &lt;div class='newTumb3'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    /*this div was created in loop 3*/ &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>my script is something like:</p>  <pre><code>for (i=1;i&lt;Num;i++){     var iDiv = document.createElement('div');     iDiv.id = 'newTumb';     iDiv.title=count;     var classN="newTumb"+count;     iDiv.className = classN;     iDiv.style.margin= '5px';     document.getElementById('thumb').appendChild(iDiv); } </code></pre>  <p>The thing is that I want to be able to click on any of those new divs (newTumbx) and an event to happen. For the life of me..can't do it!!!</p>  <p>I know that I need to use some sort of .on(click,...) jquery event, and although I have tried a huge number of suggestions my code is just not doing it. I am not getting any error in the console, but it seems the click event is never assigned.</p>  <p>As I am new to all this, I would be very grateful if someone could help and tell me where I need to put the .on(click..) event and how to make the syntax</p>  <p>Thanks for any response and your help and time.</p>
