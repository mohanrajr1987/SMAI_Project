<p>I'm attempting to click the download 'button' in the following image:  <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/DIbUw.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/DIbUw.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>As you can see in the inspector, there is extra spacing in the label, so simply doing:</p>  <pre><code>this.clickLabel("Download", "a"); </code></pre>  <p>doesn't work.</p>  <p>I've tried cutting and pasting the text from the html, but the nature of the return character producing a parsing error.</p>  <p>Any ideas?</p>  <p>Update: @Artom B.'s duplicate link does have a potential solution to the problem, but the question being asked by the user is not the same and difficult to find otherwise.</p>
