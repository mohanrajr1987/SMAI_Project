<p>EDIT 2: SOLVED.  I had to directly navigate to the src link in the iFrame... Thanks for all the help, you guys!</p>  <p>I've been trying to figure out how to click on the "Download Table" button from the website <a href="http://war-on-ice.com/playertable.html" rel="nofollow">http://war-on-ice.com/playertable.html</a> ... relevant HTML code below:</p>  <pre><code>    &lt;a class="btn shiny-download-link shiny-bound-output" id="downloadData" href="session/3d9eec9b00fc33032587b8b094e0a7b8/download/downloadData?w=" target="_blank"&gt;       &lt;i class="fa fa-download"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;       Download Table     &lt;/a&gt; </code></pre>  <p>When I click the button, it will download a .CSV file but the url changes every time the page is refreshed, so I can't navigate directly to the url.</p>  <p>I've tried a bunch of codes and have been googling for a couple days... it seems that the button is actually an Anchor (from what I can tell.. I'm not too experienced with coding).  This is the VBA code I have so far:</p>  <pre><code>    Sub ClickDownload()      Dim IE As Object     Set IE = CreateObject("InternetExplorer.application")         IE.Navigate ("http://war-on-ice.com/playertable.html")         IE.Visible = True      Do While IE.ReadyState &lt;&gt; 4 'READYSTATE_COMPLETE         DoEvents     Loop      For i = 0 To IE.Document.All.Length - 1 'lists through all elements on web page'         If IE.Document.All(i).ID = "downloadData" Then 'if anchor id is "downloadData"             IE.Document.All(i).Click 'then click on it'         End If     Next i      End Sub </code></pre>  <p>The code opens the website, but nothing happens after that (it never finds a match for the If Statement).</p>  <p>Any help on this would be awesome.  Thanks! </p>  <p>EDIT: I think this is inside an iframe, which might be causing a problem?</p>
