<p>I am looking for a way to run a function if my array contains the word 'AGE'. I am rather terrible at coding but have pieced together this code:</p>  <p>HTML:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div class="finish" &gt;?&lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Script:</p>  <pre><code>var co = ["AGE"]      $(document).ready(function(){        $(".finish").click(function(){              if (co.contains("AGE")) {                 alert($.unique(co));             return false;         }     }); }); </code></pre>  <p>Can someone help me as to what is missing? I am sure it should be very easy, but apparently I am not getting anywhere.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance, I would appreciate any help. </p>
