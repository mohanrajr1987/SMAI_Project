<p>I want to add transparency to Objects (without loosing the Click-Event). Google told me to try SortingVisual3D. Without SortingVisual3D everything (except transparency) worked well, Click-Events also.</p>  <p>Now i tried to implement it (simplified code):</p>  <pre><code>Public SV3d As New HelixToolkit.Wpf.SortingVisual3D Public Model3DUI As New ModelUIElement3D  'Apply geometry     Model3DUI.Model = geometry 'skipped geometry code in this post 'Add Click Event     AddHandler Model3DUI.MouseLeftButtonUp, AddressOf ClickEvent 'Add to SortingVisual3D     SV3d.Children.Add(Model3DUI) 'Add to ViewPort     Viewport.Children.Add(SV3d) 'Setup SortingVisual3D     SV3d.SortingFrequency = 2     SV3d.Method = HelixToolkit.Wpf.SortingMethod.BoundingBoxCorners     SV3d.IsSorting = True </code></pre>  <p>Basically it works fine, everything renders as it should and transparency is working too. But for some reason now the Click Event doesn't work. Anybody has an idea what i'm doing wrong?</p>  <p>I'm not very experienced with Helixtoolkit, so it could be that my way is completely wrong.</p>
