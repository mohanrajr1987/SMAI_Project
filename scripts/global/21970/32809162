<p>Is there a hook I can use to append a <strong>maxlength</strong> attribute to WordPress post titles? I am familiar with sub string function techniques (e.g. <a href="http://www.doc4design.com/articles/wordpress-5ways-shorten-titles/" rel="nofollow">http://www.doc4design.com/articles/wordpress-5ways-shorten-titles/</a>), but that's not the same. I've also seen the <a href="https://en-ca.wordpress.org/plugins/limit-post-titles/" rel="nofollow">Limit Post Titles</a> plugin which again works well, but still doesn't <em>enforce</em> the limit.</p>  <p>I want to <strong>limit the character length from the onset</strong>, e.g.:</p>  <p><code>&lt;input type="text" autocomplete="off" spellcheck="true" id="title" value="" size="30" maxlength="60" name="post_title" /&gt;</code></p>  <p>Having not found anything on this subject, I assume there might be reasoning as to why this is not a good idea? If so, I would be interested in knowing why.</p>
