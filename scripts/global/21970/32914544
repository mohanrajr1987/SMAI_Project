<p>I am trying to use the function <code>get_post_meta</code> inside one of the plugins I am building but when I call the function it doesn't return anything. This page at the bottom mentions "Any Post Meta function can be used in WordPress template files." <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Custom_Fields" rel="nofollow">https://codex.wordpress.org/Custom_Fields</a></p>  <p>I want to know if there is anyway that I can use post meta inside the plugin. </p>
