<p>I have a wordpress theme, which has a form to submit some content into the database. What I have to do is, when the form is submitted, I have to send an email to user, but this has to be done through a theme independent plugin.</p>  <p>Within the theme its easy to achieve by customizing the method that inserts the data, but I have to do it through a custom plugin.</p>  <p>Basically I just need a way to check if that form is submitted by user.</p>  <p>Ask questions if you have any doubt with my problem.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
