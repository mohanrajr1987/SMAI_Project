<p>I needed a question and answer section for my webpage. I downloaded the DWQA wordpress plugin. I want to install this QA section within my custom website as a standalone webpage which is hosted on Godaddy </p>  <p>1 Can i even use this wordpress plugin with my custom website <br><br> 2 Being new to plugins how do i actually install this on godaddy and add to my site. Is is simply taking all the files and uploading to the folder in godaddy and linking the index.php page to my site? thanks</p>
