<p>I'm using Pricing Table by Supsystic with Peak theme. Unfortunately Yootheme's tech support are at best slow with responding to enquiries or at worse just simply ignore questions all together. My issue is that whenever I try to insert a table using the plugins shortcode there seems to be some conflict with the themes style. The 'Description Column' (left hand column) appears lower on the actual page than it looks on the preview page of the plugin. I've included images to assist you. You can also visit the issue by going to <a href="http://www.challenge-the-box.com/the-games" rel="nofollow">http://www.challenge-the-box.com/the-games</a></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/1d0oI.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/1d0oI.jpg" alt="Correct view on the plugin page"></a> <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/tiZSh.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/tiZSh.jpg" alt="View on webpage"></a></p>  <p>Thanks!</p>  <p>Marc</p>
