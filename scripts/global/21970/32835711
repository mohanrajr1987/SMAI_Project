<p>alright, I've busted my brain trying to figure this out. I'm trying to use the mediaelementjs audio player in my Wordpress site and have read a bunch of tutorials saying that mediaelementjs is now part of the Wordpress Core and that a simple [audio] reference will make the player live.</p>  <p>However, every time I try it I just get a blank Soundcloud box that says "url is not a valid soundcloud address".</p>  <p>I've tried the enque method in functions.php for custom js but all it does is break the js that's used for mobile devices.</p>  <p>Is this an issue with the theme I'm using? Or is there a reason Soundcloud seems to randomly be the default (even though I haven't installed the Soundcloud Is Gold plugin)?</p>
