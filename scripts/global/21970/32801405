<p>I am creating a business listings and Advanced Custom Field (ACF) helps me to create the backend form.</p>  <p>The question is, how do I get the sub category of a main category only if I set the condition.</p>  <p><strong>For example,</strong> </p>  <ul> <li>I have 100s of City names as <em>City Taxonomy</em></li> <li>I have 100s of Area names as sub category of the <em>City Taxonomy</em></li> </ul>  <p>I have created a form that includes these 2 fields.</p>  <ul> <li>City:_________ (Drop down selection of <em>City Taxonomy</em>)  <br/></li> <li>Area Name:_______ (<strong>I want this sub category drop down to show up based on City selection above</strong>)</li> </ul>  <p><strong>Is this possible?</strong> Or does it require coding to make it work? I have searched enough and I could not find even a premium plugins to support this.</p>  <hr>  <p>I can simply set these 2 fields to pull data from <em>City Taxonomy</em> but the data entry becomes very tough with hyphen appearing before <em>sub-city Taxonomies</em> and possible duplicate value under different city.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
