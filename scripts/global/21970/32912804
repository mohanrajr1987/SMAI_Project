<p>My website is <a href="http://sfst.org.in" rel="nofollow">sfst.org.in</a> It has two inbuilt menu options, sub menu and one page menu. I am trying to put the navigation menu at the top but it is not visible on website view. but, when i open the website in mobile, it shows the button to show the navigation menu at the top. Can you please tell me what is wrong in the theme?</p>
