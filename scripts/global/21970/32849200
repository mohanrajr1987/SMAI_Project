<p>I have wordpress and script "B" installed in the same server. In script "B", I am trying to pull a user metadata from wordpress database so it can be displayed. I have the script below, but for some reason the foreach is not outputing nothing. I tested the query in phpmyadmin and it returns the rows, but, again, the foreach is not outputing nothing when I do it in the script. $mydb was initialized a few rows above. Please help. Thank you!</p>  <pre><code>$query = "         SELECT wp_users.ID AS id_1, wp_users.user_login AS username, wp_usermeta.user_id AS id_2, wp_usermeta.meta_key AS metakey, wp_usermeta.meta_value AS metavalue         FROM wp_users         LEFT JOIN wp_usermeta          ON wp_users.ID = wp_usermeta.user_id         WHERE wp_users.user_login = '" . $username. "'     ";      $results = $mydb-&gt;get_results( $query );     foreach ( $results as $result )      {         echo $result-&gt;metavalue."&lt;br /&gt;";     } </code></pre>
