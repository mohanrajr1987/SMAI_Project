<p>I am trying to run wp_cron event that fires based on a time range. But I can set an interval that is less than a certain period of time but not in a range. The scenario is if the <code>$wp_cron_start</code> is set to a time before noon, and if <code>$wp_cron_start</code> is greater than the current time then it can fire that day, if these conditions are not met then set the wp_cron to run next day. The problem the first condition is not working. Say for the scenario <code>$wp_cron_start = "08:00"</code>.</p>  <pre><code>$wp_cron_start = "08:00"; if ($wp_cron_start &lt; date('12:00') &amp;&amp; $wp_cron_start &gt; date("H:i")) {             if(!wp_next_scheduled('cron_hook')) {                 wp_schedule_event(strtotime($wp_cron_start), 'daily', 'cron_hook');             }         } else {             $cron_date_start = date('D H:i:s', strtotime('+1 Weekday' . $this-&gt;options['bbna_morning_button_end_time']));             wp_schedule_event(strtotime($cron_date_start), 'daily', 'cron_hook');         } </code></pre>  <p>This only sets the wp_cron for the next day. And it still does not fire. </p>
