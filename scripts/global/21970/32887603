<p>I am using Adsense wordpress plugin to place ads on my website. When I use the ad manager in design mode I can see the placement of my ads but I do not see the name of the ad. As a result, when I go to adsense website I am not able to figure which ad\ad position of mine fetched me how much revenue because I am not able figure out which ad of mine placed in design mode relates to which ad name.</p>  <p>Is there any way to see the "ad name" in ad manager in adsense wordpress plugin in design mode?</p>
