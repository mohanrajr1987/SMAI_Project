<p>We have a WordPress plugin, which dynamically - via AJAX calls - loads user specific content (html) to a page. However, WordPress theme and other plugin developers increasingly process(animation etc.) elements, using a combination of javascript and CSS, which exist in the DOM by <code>document.ready()</code>.</p>  <p>We don't have control over what they do or how they do it. If we did we'd insist on using <code>.on()</code> and <code>.trigger()</code> event delegation and packaging things up in functions.</p>  <p>Is there something that WE can do that ensures that all content introduced after <code>document.ready()</code> gets properly bound for clicks, animations etc?</p>
