<p>So here is my problem:</p>  <p>I'm using a Wordpress plugin that handles my forms (contact form 7). Within that plugin there is a function that shows a message, when a mail is been successfully sent(not succesfully submitted). But the message stays there until the page is reloaded. I want to remove that message after a few seconds. The message is in a div with a class of <code>.wpcf7-repsonse-output</code>.</p>  <p>Contactform 7 provides, within the admin section of the plugin, an option to add custom code after an event, so I added this:</p>  <pre><code>jQuery('.wpcf7-response-output').delay(3000).slideUp(400); </code></pre>  <p>The code does what it suppose to do, but does it right after the event and after that the standard function fires, so the message is still there...</p>  <p>I have found the function that handles this event and I can add my code to it to work, but when the plugin gets an update, my code is obviously gone.</p>  <p>I would prefer not to add my code to the admin section of the plugin aswell. So I would like to create a separate file where my code hooks into the existing functionality. Is that possible?</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
