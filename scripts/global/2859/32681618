<p>How I can use Java <code>logger</code> (ex: <code>BareTail</code>), over <code>ssh(sftp)</code> files?</p>  <p>I tried to use, <code>loggerExpert</code>, and I found a connection over <code>sftp</code>, but I really don't know what address I should put there.</p>  <p>I tried some URL's but without success. I think it is because I didn't find any place where I can put my password or/and username.</p>  <p>For <code>BareTail</code>, I didn't find any place where I can say, that is a connection over <code>shh</code>.</p>  <p>If you want, you can suggest other software than <code>BareTail</code> or <code>loggerExpert</code>, I just want one solution that works.</p>  <p>Ps: I can connect over <code>ssh(putty)</code>, and <code>sftp(WinSCP)</code>, so I have the URL and it works.</p>  <p>thanks</p>
