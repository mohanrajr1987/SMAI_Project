<p>When i run the following command <code>hive -e "select * from table" 2&gt;errors.txt 1&gt;result.txt</code>.<br>The file <code>error.txt</code> will include <strong>non-error</strong> information that is usually printed to the console, for example the map-reduce progress in percentage and time taken (last line in a successful Hive query).<br><br>I was unable to change this behavior through the <code>hive-log4j.properties</code> file.<br>My goal is to track 'clean' errors only.</p>
