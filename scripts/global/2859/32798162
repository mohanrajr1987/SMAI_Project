<p>My Eclipse/Tomcat project is a tangled mess of slf4j, log4j, JULI, logback, etc. As a result my console has an abundance of useless messages from various libraries and it is hard to get the logging output I want from my own code. I've resorted to using System.out's to get stuff done.</p>  <p>What I'm wondering is, where can I find a reference implementation, or checklist, that outlines what a correct configuration of all these logging frameworks is supposed to look like?</p>
