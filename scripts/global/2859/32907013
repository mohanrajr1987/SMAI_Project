<p>I'm making a project backup java application, that needs to create a mail report and send it every day. My idea was to generate the body message, and to attach to the email the application log. I'm using slf4j logger, and I don't know ho to automatically retrieve the log file path using the logger. </p>  <p>Using plain log4j seems to be easy, but I can't get out trying to retrieve it from the slf4j logger. Anyone faced this problem?</p>
