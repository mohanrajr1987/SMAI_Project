<p>I am trying to find a way to configure a maximum amount of storage for log files through log4j, but none of the options seem to fit my needs (I have checked <a href="http://www.simonsite.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.simonsite.org.uk/</a> and the <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/extras/" rel="nofollow">log4j Extras</a>, but couldn't find anything that would work).</p>  <p>The following configuration would produce a maximum disk usage of 1000 KB.  However, if one of the log files rolls over at less than 100 KB (e.g. because the Java process restarted) then I will end up with less than 1000 KB total storage.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;appender name="appender" class="org.apache.log4j.RollingFileAppender"&gt;      &lt;param name="file" value="example.log"/&gt;     &lt;param name="MaxFileSize" value="100KB"/&gt;     &lt;param name="MaxBackupIndex" value="10"/&gt; &lt;/appender&gt; </code></pre>  <p>The problem I'm trying to solve is that a Java process that restarts multiple times in quick succession very quickly causes all useful log files to be rolled over.</p>  <p>So with the 10 x 100KB configuration above I could end up with 10 log files that only have a few bytes of data each and the logs that triggered the original issue were somewhere in log file 11 or older (depending on how many restarts have occurred).</p>  <p>Is it possible to use log4j so it rolls over at 100KB per file, but only deletes old backups if the total size of all files exceeds 1000KB?</p>
