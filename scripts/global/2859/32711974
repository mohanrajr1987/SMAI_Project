<p>I'm having some trouble configuring proper logging in Eclipse Scout framework. My claims aren't that high as I only want to be able to set different log levels for different parts of my program in a configuration/properties/XML file. The logging configuration in the config.ini of my Scout server plugin currently looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>eclipse.consoleLog=true org.eclipse.scout.log=eclipse org.eclipse.scout.log.level=INFO </code></pre>  <p>So as you can see this is the default logging configuration using Eclipse logging. It works fine for logging at a global level. The only thing I would like to do is to write something like this to set the different log levels:</p>  <pre><code>packagename.ClassName=LOGLEVEL </code></pre>  <p>As this is a very basic logging use case I think there must be some easy way to do this in Scout. Otherwise I would appreciate some help how to configure log4j, JUL or others for the use with Scout. The <a href="https://wiki.eclipse.org/Scout/Concepts/Logging" rel="nofollow" title="Eclipse Scout Wiki">Eclipse Scout Wiki</a> hasn't helped me so far. I created the example logger fragment to the host plugin 'org.eclipse.scout.commons' and removed the logging configuration lines from my config.ini but nothing happens. I'm also not sure where to put the log4j.poperties or how this is done otherwise.</p>  <p>I'm a bit ashamed for being unable to figure out such a basic problem, but would be very happy about some quick help.</p>
