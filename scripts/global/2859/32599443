<p>Recently i added log4j database logging to my application. But after being deployed and being idle for few hours it gives me this error when log4j tries to invoke a sql query. </p>  <pre><code>com.mysql.jdbc.exceptions.jdbc4.CommunicationsException: The last packet successfully received from the server was 60,687,192 milliseconds ago.  The last packet sent successfully to the server was 60,687,193 milliseconds ago. is longer than the server configured value of 'wait_timeout'. You should consider either expiring and/or testing connection validity before use in your application, increasing the server configured values for client timeouts, or using the Connector/J connection property 'autoReconnect=true' to avoid this problem. </code></pre>  <p>The error message provides some solutions. but i'd like to know if this can occurr as a result of Log4j database logging. </p>  <p>Thanks in advance. </p>
