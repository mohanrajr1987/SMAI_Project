<p>I was reading the Wikipedia article on "Block(data storage)"  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_(data_storage)" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_(data_storage)</a></p>  <p>The article says </p>  <p>"Blocking reduces the overhead and speeds up the handling of the data-stream."</p>  <p>How does blocking reduce the overhead?</p>  <p>Supposed I have an array of characters </p>  <pre><code>long block_size = ...; char *buf = ...; FILE *fp = fopen(filename, "myfile"); </code></pre>  <p>and loop over this function</p>  <pre><code>While(everything in buf not written)     fwrite(buf, 1, block_size, fp);     fflush(fp); </code></pre>  <p>How does something like this reduce overhead? It seems like this might even increase overhead? Is the example I gave a correct way of using blocking?</p>
