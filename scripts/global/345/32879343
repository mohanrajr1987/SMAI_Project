<p>I have a c# console application I will be sending commends to using Java, with the techniques described here <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12013721/sending-commands-to-a-console-application">Sending commands to a console application?</a></p>  <p>My issue is that the console application is in a folder that's in the same folder with the jar, and I can't find out how to execute a file relative to the same directory as the jar.</p>  <p>I tried a lot of things in Java, like</p>  <pre><code>Process pr = Runtime.getRuntime().exec("runtime_libraries/consoleapp.exe"); </code></pre>  <p>But it says the file can't be found. </p>  <pre><code>java.io.IOException: CreateProcess error=2, The system cannot find the file specified </code></pre>  <p>I assumed it would be simple, but apparently it's not.</p>  <p>So my question is, how can I put a relative path into the Runtime exec? </p>
