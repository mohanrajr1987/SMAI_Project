<p>I'm making an application that can upload AND download files from azure blob storage. I can download as an entire stream. Since the application will run on devices - often with a poor connection - i need to be able to download the file in different sized chunks. During download i need to write the chunks to a storage file as download progresses.</p>  <pre><code>  public async void Download()     {         StorageFolder localFolder = ApplicationData.Current.LocalFolder;         StorageFile storageFile = await localFolder.CreateFileAsync("NameOfFile", CreationCollisionOption.OpenIfExists);         using (HttpClient client = new HttpClient())         {             long fileLength = LengthOfFile;             long bytesRecieved = 0;             while (fileLength &gt; bytesRecieved)             {                 long packageSize = MaxPackageSize;                  client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Range = new RangeHeaderValue((long)bytesRecieved, packageSize);                 var response = await client.GetAsync("downloadurl");                 var stream = await response.Content.ReadAsStreamAsync();                 using (IRandomAccessStream stream = await storageFile.OpenAsync(FileAccessMode.ReadWrite))                 {                     //right here - how to i write to the storagefile multible times from last index?                 }             }         }     } </code></pre>
