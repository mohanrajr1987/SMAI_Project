<p>The software that I have made successfully reads the text file character by character, stores the count of each letter frequency in an Int array, and then lists them out, alphabetically. I need to do a descending format.</p>  <p>What I need help with is how do I store the character count alongside that particular character in an array?</p>  <p>This is an example of the current output I have:</p>  <pre><code>    Letter            Frequency      A                   0       B                   1       C                   7       D                   0        E                   14  </code></pre>  <p>..etc</p>  <p>I need to make it something like this:</p>  <pre><code>    Letter            Frequency      E                   14       C                   7       B                   1       D                   0        A                   0 </code></pre>  <p>This is a snipped from what I have so far:</p>  <pre><code>System.out.println("Letter            Frequency"); while ((nextLetter = in.read())!= -1) {      current = ((char)nextLetter);  letter     current = Character.toLowerCase (current);     if (current &gt;= 'a' &amp;&amp; current &lt;= 'z'){        count [current- 'a']++;           total++;      }     else{       other ++;     } } for (int ii=0; ii&lt;26; ii++){     System.out.printf ("%c                   %d \n", ii+ 'A', count [ii]); } </code></pre>
