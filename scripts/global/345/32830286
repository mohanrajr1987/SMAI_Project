<p>It is possible, to trigger a CompletionPort queue in any way caused from an event which is created f.e. with CreateEvent by setting the event via SetEvent?</p>  <p>Background: There is a driver software which triggers an event, if a message comes in. I want to connect this with a CompletionPort (best case with boost.asio) directly. Of course I know WaitForMultipleObject, create a thread, wait for the event and call PostQueuedCompletionStatus. That is not the question. Can I trigger the CompletionPort-Queue directly by the operation system without creating an extra thread?</p>
