<p>Here is my homework:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Let f be a file of terms. Define a procedure      <code>findterm(Term)</code>    that displays on the terminal the first term in f that matches the Term. </p>      <p>Let f be a file of terms. Write a procedure      <code>findallterm(Term)</code>    that displays on the terminal all the terms in f that matches the Term. Make sure that Term is not instantiated in the process (which could prevent its match with terms that occur later in the file).</p> </blockquote>  <p>I tried using cut to solve the first one</p>  <pre><code> findterm(end_of_file) :- !.    findterm(Term) :-          read(Term1),          Term = Term1,          write(Term1), nl, !          ;          findterm(Term).  </code></pre>  <p>Can anyone help me with the second?</p>
