<p>I am really confused about outputting strings in Assembly. I have been told to use the "PUTS" Assembler Name to print characters to the console, but I am not sure how to use it. Here is what I have so far, but it causes errors:</p>  <pre><code>LD R1, MESS_ARR; Array in register 1 PUTS R1; Print out the string at first index ADD R1,R1,1; Add to go to next memory location </code></pre>  <p>Thanks!</p>
