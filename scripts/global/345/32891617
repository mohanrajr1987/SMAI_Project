<p>The following code is from a method in a class that I am making to modify a list of file directories in a program folder. However I am trying to use "\" as a delimiter for a scanner as I only need the start of the directory "S:\" and the last part which is just name of a sub folder. So for example it looks like this: </p>  <p>F:\Data\Subfolder\Another</p>  <p>The code complies but when I run the method i get this following run time error:</p>  <p>java.util.regex.PatternSyntaxException: Unexpected internal error near index 1 \</p>  <p>And was just wondering if anyone knows what it means and how I can stop it from happening. Is it because of using the \ for a delimeter? </p>  <p>Note: newFolder class is a nested class</p>  <pre><code>public void scanFiles() throws IOException{         try        {         System.out.println("Sage 2015 is Installed on this machine");         File companyFile = new File(sageFolders[8] + "\\COMPANY");         Scanner input = new Scanner(new BufferedReader(new FileReader(companyFile)));         input.useDelimiter("\\");           while(input.hasNextLine())         {            if(line.contains("F"))            {                String drive = input.next();                String dataFolder = input.next();                String sageFolder = input.next();                String clientFolder = input.next();                 newFolders.add(new newFolder(drive, clientFolder));              }          }         //Close the Readers         fileReader.close();         bufferedReader.close();          //fileWriter = new FileWriter(companyFile);         //bufferedWriter = new BufferedWriter(fileWriter);             //Write back to file          //fileWriter.flush();         //bufferedWriter.close();         }        catch(FileNotFoundException e)        {           System.out.println("File not Found: Moving onto next Version");         }  }  class newFolder {     private String driveLetter;     private String clientFolder;      public newFolder(String driveLetter, String clientFolder)     {         this.driveLetter = driveLetter;         this.clientFolder = clientFolder;     } } </code></pre>
