<p>I have this problem where I have 20 text files with almost the same name but different text in them (it has int&amp;double values inside).Thier names are like this:</p>  <ul> <li>fake_weather_riyadh_1 </li> <li>fake_weather_riyadh_2  </li> <li>fake_weather_riyadh_3</li> </ul>  <p>etc. Until it reaches 20</p>  <p>so my problem is which method do I need to use in order to make the program read  all of the contents of these files without having to write:</p>  <pre><code>String inputFileName = "fake_weather_riyadh_1.txt"; String inputFileName = "fake_weather_riyadh_2.txt"; </code></pre>  <p>etc.</p>  <p>Note: I'm still kind of a beginner in Java.</p>  <p>I hope I was clear and Thanks.</p>
