<p>I am working on a C# Console application which exports a dataset to an excel file and saves the file to a shared network drive using absolute path as follows</p>  <pre><code>string fileDestination = @"Z:\Physical DB Dumps\Physical Data\Physical DB Data " + filedate + ".xls";                 if (File.Exists(fileDestination))                 {                      File.Delete(fileDestination);                 }                  workbook.SaveAs(fileDestination, Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.XlFileFormat.xlWorkbookNormal, Type.Missing, Type.Missing, Type.Missing, Type.Missing, Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.XlSaveAsAccessMode.xlExclusive, Type.Missing, Type.Missing, Type.Missing, Type.Missing);                 workbook.Close(true, Type.Missing, Type.Missing);                 app.Quit(); </code></pre>  <p>but for some reasons I could not save the file to the destination and I do not require to provide username and password for the drive as the network drive is always connected to my local machine and can be accessed without the credentials.</p>  <p>Not sure what the issue is.  <strong>May I know a better way to do this?</strong></p>
