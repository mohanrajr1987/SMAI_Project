<h2>What I want to do...</h2>  <p>I have XML-Files with names like <em>SomeName999999blablabla.xml</em> with lots of content, where almost every line contains the string <code>"999999"</code>. I need identical xml-files where <code>999999</code> is replaced by <code>888888</code>, <code>777777</code>, and so on, in the name and the file's content.</p>  <h2>The problem...</h2>  <p>My code works fine and actually creates all the files I need, BUT there are sometimes tiny errors. Like in one line an E is "randomly" replaced by a D (it seems to be always one letter lower than what its supposed to be, but I can't confirm that 100%). Its not a lot, like one or two instances in 60 files, each file being about 100MB. But since its an xml this is a real problem, as this often is a schema violation, which causes a crash in later processing. I have absolutely no idea where this is coming from or how to fix it, please help.</p>  <h2>My code so far...</h2>  <pre><code>private void createMandant(String mandant) throws Exception {     String line;     File dir = new File(TestConstants.getXmlDirectory());      for (File file : dir.listFiles()) {         if (file.getName().endsWith((".xml")) &amp;&amp; file.getName().contains("999999")) {             BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file));             FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(file.getAbsolutePath().replace("999999", mandant));              while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {                 fw.write(line.replace("999999", mandant) + "\r\n");             }              br.close();             fw.close();         }     } } </code></pre>  <h2>Environment...</h2>  <p>We are on Java 6. As mentioned before the files are quite large. Like 100MB, several hundred thousand lines each. </p>
