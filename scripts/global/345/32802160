<p>I am trying to do a lagrange interpolation given a file with then following format:</p>  <pre><code>1 value 2 value  3 value  ... </code></pre>  <p>So i have to build two vectors, one with the index and one with the values.  Here is how I'm trying to it: </p>  <pre><code>... vec_ZZ index; vec_ZZ value; ZZ i = 0; while(!in.eof()){     in &gt;&gt; index[i]     in &gt;&gt; value[i] } ZZ_pX P; ZZ_pX.interpolate(P, index, value); ... </code></pre>  <p>Im new to the NTL library and it is very confusing so far.  Does anyone have any tips on how to do this?</p>
