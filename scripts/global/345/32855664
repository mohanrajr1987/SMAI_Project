<p>Here is my code:</p>  <pre><code>#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;  int main() {     int a = '\0';      while ((a = getchar()) != EOF){         if (a != ' ' || a != '\t' || a != '\n' || a != ';' || a != ',' || a != '.'){             putchar(a);         }         else{             continue;         }     }      system("pause");     return 0; } </code></pre>  <p>I need to read a poem from an input file, and output the poem with no spaces or punctuation. Must be done using I/O variation. I've searched all over, but I can't seem to find how to do this the way I need. Any help is much appreciated...</p>
