<p>I have a 60 MB text file through which my program searches for a specific ID and extract some related text. And I have to repeat the process for 200+ IDs. Initially, I used a loop to cycle through the lines of the file and look for the ID and then extract the related text but it takes way too long(~2 min). So instead, now I am looking at way to load the entire file into memory, then search for my IDs and associated text from there; I imagine that should be faster than accessing the hard drive 200+ times. So I wrote the following code to load the file into memory:</p>  <pre><code>public String createLocalFile(String path) {        String text = "";     try     {         FileReader fileReader = new FileReader( path );         BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader( fileReader );         String currentLine = "";         while( (currentLine = reader.readLine() ) != null )         {             text += currentLine;             System.out.println( currentLine );         }      }     catch(IOException ex)     {         System.out.println(ex.getMessage());     }     return text; } </code></pre>  <p>Unfortunately, saving the file's text into a String variable takes an extremely long time. How can I load the file faster ? Or is there a better way to accomplish the same task ? Thanks for any help.</p>  <p>Edit: Here is the link to the file <code>https://github.com/MVZSEQ/denovoTranscriptomeMarkerDevelopment/blob/master/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.pep.all.fa</code></p>  <p>Typical line looks like:</p>  <pre><code>&gt;ENSP00000471873 pep:putative chromosome:GRCh38:19:49496434:49499689:1 gene:ENSG00000142534 transcript:ENST00000594493 gene_biotype:protein_coding transcript_biotype:protein_coding\ MKMQRTIVIRRDYLHYIRKYNRFEKRHKNMSVHLSPCFRDVQIGDIVTVGECRPLSKTVR\ FNVLKVTKAAGTKKQFQKF\ </code></pre>  <p>Where <code>ENSP00000471873</code> is the ID and the text I would be extracting is </p>  <pre><code>MKMQRTIVIRRDYLHYIRKYNRFEKRHKNMSVHLSPCFRDVQIGDIVTVGECRPLSKTVR\     FNVLKVTKAAGTKKQFQKF\ </code></pre>
