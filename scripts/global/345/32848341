<p>question: In my Arduino  main loop, the interrupt must always enabled to process some events.  At the same time the there are heavy I/O with USB port using Serial.print().  But the I/O also uses interrupt.  Some times they cause conflict and hang the program, some time not.  The events are not predictable.  So what I can do is during the I/O, disable the interrupt then re-enable it using noInterrupts() and interrupts() pair for every I/O.  But this is too expansive.  Any suggestion?</p>
