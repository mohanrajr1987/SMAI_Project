<p>I recently ran into some obstacles when dealing with my assignment. It asks me to read in some data from a file and then store it. And there is more: I have to make adjustments to the array size since I will not be able to know it until the txt file is given by the grader. My questions are listed below and I will post my attempt.</p>  <p>The form of the data in the txt will be like this (I saw some similar posts but there is not a clear answer and I really want someone to help me get through this).</p>  <pre><code>&lt;1&gt; Jane [animals] baby &lt;34&gt; [sincere] wildlife [human] cause [global] &lt;56&gt; implement [search] </code></pre>  <p>So the format is like this. And I have some ideas like read in the stuff in <code>&lt; &gt;</code> and <code>[ ]</code> separately but treated as chars first. Then goes into the char array and get the number that was originally stored in <code>&lt; &gt;</code> note that only stuff in <code>&lt;&gt;</code> and <code>[]</code> needs to be read and stored. But my attempt does not seem to work.</p>  <p>And also I sort of need to resize the array which got me really confused. I feel like once I get through this read in I might be able to deal with other stuff easily.</p>  <p>Code: so messed up and hope someone just shed some light on this so that I can understand how it works.</p>  <pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt; #include &lt;sstream&gt; #include &lt;fstream&gt; #include &lt;string.h&gt;   using namespace std;  int main(int argc, char* argv[]) { if(argc != 3)     cout&lt;&lt; "Error! Not enough file!"&lt;&lt;endl; char** page = new char*[10]; char** words = new char*[10];  ifstream input (argv[1]); char tool1; char tool2; char tool3; char tool4;  int iVal; input &gt;&gt; tool1 &gt;&gt; iVal&gt;&gt; tool2;  for(int i = 0; i &lt; sizeof(page); i++) {     if(tool1 != "&lt;"|| tool2 != "&gt;")         input.clear(ios_base::failbit);     else getline(input, page[i]);      if(tool3 != "["|| tool4 != "]")         input.clear(ios_base::failbit);     else getline(input, words[i]); } } </code></pre>  <p>PS: It appears a lot of errors are in this code and while you may be giving me suggestions I will also continue to improve on this.</p>
