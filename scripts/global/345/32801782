<p>So Im trying to read a text file in scala and whenever and I see a certain symbol I want to write something onto the text file at that certain point in the text file.</p>  <p>for example I am reading a file which contains :</p>  <blockquote>   <p><strong>Hi my name is "", and this is a text file.</strong></p> </blockquote>  <p>So while reading the file I want to write something to it when i see the symbol ""; how would i go along doing this in scala?</p>
