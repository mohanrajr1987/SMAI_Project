<p>I have a Spring-based module that I need to integrate with an existing/legacy Java "standalone" app. The Spring-based module is a simple implementation of an <strong>AuthenticationProvider</strong> (spring-security). </p>  <p>What I would like to do is hook up the spring based module in a Java application in a way that I can simply call the authenticate method on that provider from the Java code. </p>  <p>Is that possible? What is required? </p>  <p>Is it possible to wrap the spring module in a plain Java library and use that as API interface for my standalone Java app?</p>  <p>I already searched for specific tutorials but it seems there isn't one that fit this requirement.</p>
