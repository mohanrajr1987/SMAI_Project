<p>After enabling global-method-security using the AspectJ mode for JSF beans marked with @Configurable to enable Spring DI on them, I'm now trying to secure some Spring Data repositories. Unfortunately, this requires the proxy mode, as the repositories are just interfaces.</p>  <p>Using Spring Framework 4.2.1 + Spring Security 4.0.2 + Spring Data Gosling</p>  <p>Any idea on how to accomplish this?</p>
