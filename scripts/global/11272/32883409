<p>I have created two way to login into my site. first way i have implemented spring security. In that spring security is for <code>/user/home</code> path i.e if path contain <code>/user</code> then it should be done by spring security. this is working fine. Now problem is I have implemented SAML signle sign on and when i get successful authentication, i want to goto home page. but when i am doing this again it is asking the login credentails in spring security. how can i directly goto home page without  spring security in this case.</p>  <p>spring-security.xml</p>  <pre><code>&lt;http use-expressions="true" auto-config="true"&gt;         &lt;intercept-url pattern="/user/*" access="hasRole('ROLE_ADMIN') or hasRole('ROLE_USER')" /&gt;         &lt;!-- &lt;http-basic/&gt; --&gt;         &lt;form-login login-page="/login/loginUser" authentication-failure-url="/user/failed_login" /&gt;         &lt;logout logout-url="/user/logout"/&gt; &lt;/http&gt; </code></pre>  <p>can i dynamically disable spring security at run time.</p>
