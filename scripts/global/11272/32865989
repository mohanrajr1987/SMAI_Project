<p>I'm looking at the <a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/master/ldap/src/test/java/org/springframework/security/ldap/authentication/ad/ActiveDirectoryLdapAuthenticationProviderTests.java" rel="nofollow">ActiveDirectoryLdapAuthenticationProviderTests</a>, and it looks like the tests expect to run against a local server ("ldap://192.168.1.200/").  Am I reading this correctly?  If I checked out the code, is there a way I could build and test it?</p>
