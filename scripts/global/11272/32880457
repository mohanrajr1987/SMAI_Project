<p>I am using the spring-ldap module specifically the LdapTemplate class for authentication with an LDAP Server. (authenticate methods)</p>  <p><a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring-ldap/docs/current/apidocs/org/springframework/ldap/core/LdapTemplate.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.spring.io/spring-ldap/docs/current/apidocs/org/springframework/ldap/core/LdapTemplate.html</a></p>  <p>The issue I have with calling this method is that it uses a String for the password. That exposes these calls to Heap Inspection attacks because the immutable String hangs around in memory for a while until GC'ed after use. </p>  <p>Are there alternate ways to use this module so that we can pass a CharSequence instead that is zero'ed out after use?</p>
