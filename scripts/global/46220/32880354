<p>I am trying to retrieve user agent stylesheet using Chrome remote debugging protocol, but it is only returning regular stylesheet. What I have done so far: I have added listener on CSS.styleSheetAdded event and in this it is just returning regular stylesheet.  Chrome dev tools also is a web app and there I can see user agent stylesheet. I am not sure what I am missing here. Looking at the protocol it seems I have done everything correctly, but it doesn't work. Can anyone please help, how to get user agent stylesheet?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
