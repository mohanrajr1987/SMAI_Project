<p>I am trying to create a basic chrome extension that adds images from websites that a user visits.  I am having an exceptionally difficult time figuring out web scraping with Javascript/ jQuery.  Every tutorial that I have found for web scraping involves using node.js in conjunction with cheerio and requests.  Is this the easiest method to get data from the web?  Is it necessary to use node.js?  Will I run into any problems using node.js and then trying to package my script into a chrome extension down the road?  Thank you</p>
