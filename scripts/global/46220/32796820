<p>I created a chrome extension and I released an update few days ago. As far as I know, when the user re-opening the browser or restarting his pc, chrome should auto update the extensions automatically. However, I noticed that for some of my users, even when they restarted their pc, they still on an old version of the extension and it won't auto update.</p>  <p>The current newest version is 1.3.2. I uploaded it few days ago. Some of the users are still on version 1.3.1 even though they restarted their pc.</p>  <p>Why does it happen? As far as I know there is no option to disable auto-update of extensions..</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>  <p>Chromium bug reported (Edit suggestions are welcomed): <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=537646&amp;thanks=537646&amp;ts=1443630404" rel="nofollow">https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=537646&amp;thanks=537646&amp;ts=1443630404</a></p>
