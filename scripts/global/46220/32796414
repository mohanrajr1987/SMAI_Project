<p>Since Opera supports the Chrome extension API, it is almost possible to run a full-featured Chrome extension on this browser. However there are still some missing features in the API.</p>  <p>Is there a simple and efficient way to check if an extension is currently running on Opera or Google Chrome?</p>  <hr>  <p>The specific use case I'm facing is when invoking <code>chrome.notifications.create</code>: on Google Chrome it is possible to set a <code>buttons</code> attribute to add buttons to it. Opera does not support it and instead of ignoring the attribute, it throws an error:</p>  <pre><code>Unchecked runtime.lastError while running notifications.create: Adding buttons to notifications is not supported. </code></pre>  <p>So I need a way to check the browser beforehand instead of handling the error.</p>
