<p>I am trying to update my Javascript knowledge,</p>  <p>At the moment I am currently developing a Google Chrome extension, I tried to save some information in the local storage, but of course, the data is deleted after close the browser.</p>  <p>I thought in use chrome.storage however for some stupid reason, is not working (manifiest file edited with storage permissions provided)</p>  <p>here my example code :</p>  <pre><code>chrome.storage.local.set({"SRSaved": "ASDASD"}, function(){}); chrome.storage.local.get("SRSaved", function(result){idList = result;});  </code></pre>  <p>If inside the getter function I print the value of result, is a object and the data is there, ok, however the idList value is undefined, is strange, and , of course idList is declared before</p>  <p>Someone can bring me some light with this problem?</p>
