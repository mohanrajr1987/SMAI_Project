<p>I have an chrome extension that might be disabled by the user. I want to create a link to the chrome://extensions menu in that case. It would be something like</p>  <pre><code>&lt;a href="chrome://extensions" target="_blank"&gt;Chrome extensions&lt;/a&gt; </code></pre>  <p>which is not allowed: <em>Not allowed to load local resource: chrome://extensions/</em></p>  <p>Most of the solutions I have read imply the use of an extension (which for this use case will be disabled):</p>  <pre><code>chrome.tabs.create({'url': 'chrome://extensions'}); </code></pre>  <p>Is there any way to solve this issue?</p>  <p>Of course, I might be wrong... In that case, what could I do?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
