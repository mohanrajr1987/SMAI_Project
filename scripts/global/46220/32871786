<p>My Chrome extension is distributed through the Chrome store, which is supposed to manage the auto-update itself and push it after a few hours to my users.</p>  <p>I pushed an update more than one week ago and it seems that is hasn't been pushed to any user. The Chrome store is displaying the latest version number, but browsers are just not updating.</p>  <p>I know how to force my browser to update but I want the update to push to all my users.</p>  <p>Is there any thing I'm missing? Thanks!</p>
