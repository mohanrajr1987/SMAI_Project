<p>I am working on a Chrome extension that depends on a heavy JS library. I want to have this library load on demand, e.g. when a certain element is found in the DOM, so that it doesn't consume memory when not needed.</p>  <p>What is the advised approach to achieve that? Should I load the heavy lib in the <em>content</em> script, should I inject it via the <em>background</em> page, or should I take any other approach?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
