<p>I am developing a Google Cast sender application and on my web page in chrome browser, I need to detect if the Google Cast extension is installed or not before doing something.</p>  <p>I did some searching and found some suggestions for detecting chrome extensions if developer owns both website and extension. In my case, I am trying to detect an extension not developed by me. Is there an API or another way to detect installation of a third party chrome extension?</p>
