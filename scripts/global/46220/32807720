<p>There is a web site with this snippet in every page:</p>  <pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>var refreshSite;  refreshSiteInterval(); function refreshSiteInterval() {   refreshSite = setInterval(     function() { document.location = document.location; },      420000); }; function stopRefreshSite() {   clearInterval(refreshSite); } </code></pre>    <p>Calling <code>stopRefreshSite()</code> from javascript console stops the timed refresh from occurring.</p>  <p>I'd like to disable this recurring refresh with a chrome extension. I thought that a content script which calls <code>stopRefreshSite()</code> whenever the page loads makes sense, though because content scripts execute in an <em>isolated world</em> this doesn't seem to be possible.</p>  <p>Is there any way to call the webpage function? Or would trying to prevent the original javascript from running in the first place be a better strategy?</p>
