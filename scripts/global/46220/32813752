<p>I created a chrome web app.  The app simply opens my web site.  This is working as expected.  The app is available on the Chrome Web Store.  I am able to add it to Chrome.  The site was existing, so I simply added the url and launch properties in the manifest.json.  I am new to GCM altogether.  I am trying to configure code to send a notification or message to the web app using GCM.  I understand I need to add javascript code to register the app.  The documentation I am reading isn't as straight forward as I would like or understand.  I am a little confused at this part.  I added this to the manifest.json file:</p>  <pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>"background": {       "scripts": ["scripts/main.js"]     } </code></pre>  <p>What is javascript code I would include in the main.js file to register the web app?  Also, can someone tell me what or how that register function is called?  The only files in my package are the manifest.json and main.js files.  Specific examples would be very much appreciated.</p>  <p>I do not need to do anything complex at this time.  I would simply like to test the GCM notification process to a Chrome Web App.  I also understand there is an application server component, but first want to make sure the Web App is configured correctly with the right files and code.</p>
