<p>I'm developing a Chrome extension, and I'm adding an <code>onmouseover</code> handler to each of the images on a page. When the user mouses over an image, it's URL should be stored in a variable. I know I can easily get the value of the <code>src</code> attribute of the image, but I want the full URL. The <code>src</code> attribute stores the path of the image on the server. For example, when you right click an image in Google Chrome, you get the "Copy Image URL" option, which copies the image's URL to the clipboard. </p>  <p>Is there any way to achieve this? Thanks.</p>
