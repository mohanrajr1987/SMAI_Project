<p>Is it possible to get the selected text in an input box of a website e.g. by using jQuery?</p>  <p>I have tried with <code>var kelet = window.getSelection().toString();</code> but this code get only the text <strong>in a paragraph</strong> and not in an <strong>input box</strong>. </p>  <hr>  <p>maybe I was unclear, I want to get the text from a website that I didn't creat. I'm building a chrome extension and I need to get the text from input box of a website.</p>
