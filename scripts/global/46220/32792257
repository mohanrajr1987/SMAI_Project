<p>Interested to find out if there is an order in which Chrome Extensions get called to handle a page.</p>  <p>This is of interest since extensions can modify the layout and elements of the page (for example ad blockers). </p>  <p>Im wondering if by the time extension x is called it operates on a page which was modified by the previous x-1 extensions and if so is there a way to control the order in which a page is 'filtered' though the various extensions installed.</p>
