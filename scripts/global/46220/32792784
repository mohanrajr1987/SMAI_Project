<p>There's a website that many people in university programs despise that is blackboard. My school has their own instance of blackboard running that must be completely misconfigured because your session times out almost instantly or you get thousands of errors popping up as you try to browse after logging in. These problems seem to be fixed when logging in via incognito mode.</p>  <p><strong>Question:</strong> I've created an extension that, when you navigate to blackboard, closes your current tab and opens blackboard in a new incognito window. Is it possible to achieve something to the same effect inside the current tab?</p>  <p>My current solution works fine, but it would be 100 times better to "spoof" incognito in the current tab.</p>
