<p>I'm working on a chrome extension, the extension relies on MustacheJS for templating.</p>  <p>When running my extension while visiting wallmart.com I get the following error: <code> Uncaught ReferenceError: Mustache is not defined </code></p>  <p>My guess is that wallmart is also using Mustache but I couldn't find any proof that, maybe they are not?</p>  <p>Anyways - to the question: Is it possible to run Mustache under a different name? For example instead of calling <code>Mustache.Render(...)</code>, calling <code>myVar.Render(...)</code></p>  <p>Couldn't find anything in the documentation..</p>  <p><strong>Please note:</strong></p>  <ul> <li>I'm any not using AMD/Require of some sort</li> <li>When running my extension on other websites everything work just fine..</li> </ul>
