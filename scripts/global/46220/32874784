<p>I'm trying to invoke a function by waiting til the content of the page is load and triggered by a click by the user. Here is what I have:</p>  <pre><code>function get_content(){ var element = document.getElementById("v0"); var text = element.innerText || element.textContent; console.log(text); }  document.addEventListener('DOMContentReady', function () { document.getElementById("v0");       .addEventListener('click', get_content); }); </code></pre>  <p>Is the document.getElementById("v0") making it so that the user must click on that specific element? Because that element is generated via a XmlHttpRequest. <br>I'm more thinking in the lines of when the user clicks and generates the DOM, it will log the text content by itself. <br>The code doesn't work and I don't exactly know why.</p>
