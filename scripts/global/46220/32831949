<p>So I am trying to create a bunch of tabs from a list of tabs in a list names groups like this..</p>  <pre><code>console.log("groups.length: " + groups.length); // loop through groups     for (var i = 0; i &lt; groups.length; i++) {         // create the new tab         console.log("for loop ran: " + i);          // cannot use i in here because async         chrome.tabs.create({             windowId: win.id,             index: i,             url: groups[i].urls[0]         }, function(tab){             console.log("i: " + i);             groups[i].tabId = tab.id;  // this is not working right!!!         });     } </code></pre>  <p>So in the terminal I get..</p>  <pre><code>groups.length: 2 popup.js:87 for loop ran: 0 popup.js:87 for loop ran: 1 popup.js:95 i: 2 popup.js:95 i: 2 </code></pre>  <p>Can someone explain to me what is going on here. I thought that even though the task is async it should still input the value of i as it was when the call was first made. Also why would line 95 ever show i = 2? How could i ever be greater than 1? I'm really confused, thanks kind internet programmers.</p>
