<p>So I'm trying to make an extension that runs a script when a submit button is pressed. Since Google Chrome extensions cannot have the scripts directly inside the HTML for security reasons, I need to have an external script. How do I call a function from an external script with the submit button?</p>  <p>This is what I've tried so far:</p>  <p>Here's the popup.html:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;html&gt;     &lt;head&gt;         &lt;!--css styling removed from here--&gt;         &lt;script src="popup.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;      &lt;/head&gt;     &lt;body&gt;         &lt;!--html page is working fine, only the button is not--&gt;         &lt;input type="submit" value="Submit" onclick="convert();"&gt;         &lt;p id="p2"&gt;Value&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; </code></pre>  <p>(I've also tried calling  <code>popup.convert();</code> , but that doesn't work either)</p>  <p>And here's the popup.js:</p>  <pre><code>function convert(){     document.getElementById("p2").innerHTML = "Hello!"; } </code></pre>  <p>I'm trying to change the p element in my extension popup, not the webpage.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>  <p>EDIT: It was suggested that my question was a duplicate of this: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13591983/onclick-within-chrome-extension-not-working">onClick within Chrome Extension not working</a></p>  <p>That didn't really help, although it did give me a link to <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/contentSecurityPolicy#JSExecution" rel="nofollow">https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/contentSecurityPolicy#JSExecution</a> which was semi-helpful.</p>  <p><strong>The problem with the solution on the other question is that it is not a button but a link.</strong> (Thanks for pointing me to that topic anyway!)</p>
