<p>Both my mom and I use LTE almost daily and end up wasting quota on sites that autoplay videos we aren't interested in.  Surprisingly a Google search didn't reveal a good option.  Has anyone developed a Chrome extension that can detect LTE is being used and prevent download or streaming of video content? </p>
