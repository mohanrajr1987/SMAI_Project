<p>My page has an H2 class that says </p>  <pre><code>H2.clearboth {clear: both; height:16px;} </code></pre>  <p>This works fine in I.E. but in Firefox and Chrome I need to ignore the <code>height</code> property because that is what is messing up the design. Is there a way for me to do this for Firefox and Chrome?</p>  <p>So I tried to do a browser specific <code>-moz</code> but there is no specific property for ignoring just <code>height</code>.</p>  <p>Thanks for any help or advice on this,</p>  <p>thanks, Paul</p>
