<p>I've previously posted a question about how to run ordered tests on Chrome on cross browser testing.(still to be resolved) The link:<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32690292/cross-browser-testing-on-chrome-failing-for-ordered-tests">Cross-Browser testing on Chrome failing for Ordered Tests</a></p>  <p>I thought of an alternate method, though this would be the last approach for me if there is nothing else i can do. <strong>IF</strong> there is no way to execute an ordered test, should the entire ordered test (only for chrome) be run as a single method ?</p>  <p>For Example: </p>  <p><em>My current ordered test</em> "readbooksample.orderedtest" has the following test methods:</p>  <p>Login</p>  <p>Click books tab</p>  <p>Select a book</p>  <p>Read sample</p>  <p>Click logout</p>  <p><em>Now this becomes</em> -  Ordered Test "readbooksample.orderedtest" contains one method:</p>  <p>Login -> and then call "Click books tab", "Select a book", "Read sample", "Click logout"</p>  <p>So here the issue of browser closing while control moving from one method to another does not come up, but the point is lost if i do the whole thing in one method.</p>  <p>Has anyone ran an ordered test on chrome via cross browser method before ?  Or has anyone tried this above method ?</p>  <p>Please let me know if there are alternate ways or if this is the current working of  how an ordered test can run on chrome.</p>
