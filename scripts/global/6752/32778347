<p>I have what I think is a coding error but I've gone a bit blind to it. It is possible it may be a compatibility error though or needs recoding. Please look at the following link:</p>  <p><a href="http://freedomtocycle.co.uk/shop/forme-hooklow-1" rel="nofollow">http://freedomtocycle.co.uk/shop/forme-hooklow-1</a></p>  <p>At the bottom of the product are three tags, description, specification and product tags. The first and last are displaying correctly, the specification tab in the middle is in the code and displays on all browsers apart from Firefox. As far as I can see the coding is okay and it can't be awful or it wouldn't show in any browser! but I'm sure it's a rookie error somewhere I have missed, the annoyance is compounded by the fact the other two tabs are working. Could it be that table that is causing the problem? Any ideas welcome? Thank you.</p>
