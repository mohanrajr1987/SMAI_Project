<p>I am using a simple input field with ng-keypress in order to record which keys are being pressed. </p>  <p>Works perfectly fine on Firefox, but I just realized that on Chrome, the $event's key attribute is undefined when using Chrome. </p>  <p>Bellow, the $event content of pressing the 'a' key on both browser's consoles.</p>  <p>Firefox: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ji8xk.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ji8xk.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Chrome: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Bhium.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Bhium.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Anybody know what the issue here is?</p>
