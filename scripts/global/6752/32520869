<p>I have an asp.net web application developed with IE8 infocus. i.e site works in IE8. What we have noticed is, in higher IE versions like IE9 and 11, certain UI elements are not correct and some jquery methods aren't working. Now , is there a tool that can help me test the applications with out having to install Virtual machines or different IE versions? and what is the best way to go about this? </p>
