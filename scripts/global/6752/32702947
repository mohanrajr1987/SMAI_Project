<p>My ASP.NET project seems to run the best in Firefox.</p>  <p>Mainly while someone is navigating around the site, Firefox has no blank pages of white screen while the page is changing, and it looks like it's not reloading the top nav bar of the page or the footer/wrap around the partials that go in the middle.</p>  <p>Chrome and Internet Explorer (obviously) not so much. They seem to reload the entire page every time there is navigation performed.</p>  <p>Is there something I can change about my project configuration that would cause this kind of behaviour? I suppose it isn't too important but it would be nice if it looked as good on Chrome as it does on Firefox.</p>  <p>If anyone wanted to see code from a specific place/config in my ASP.NET project I can post it.</p>
