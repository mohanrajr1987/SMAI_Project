<p>Relative redirects (i.e. relative URLs in the HTTP Location: header) were originally not supported according to <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-14.30">RFC 2616, section 14.30</a>. However this was described as a "bug in the spec", and was later changed in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-7.1.2">RFC 7231, section 7.1.2</a>. Thus relative redirects are now "officially supported".</p>  <p>My question is: Are there any known cases of HTTP clients (browsers, tools, libraries..) <em>not</em> supporting relative redirects?</p>  <p><strong>Update:</strong> Alternatively, a valid answer could provide a exhaustive list of HTTP clients which are known to accept relative redirects, along with version number ranges.</p>
