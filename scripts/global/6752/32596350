<p>I'm using this plugin to upload, resize and preview images in application. But I'm a little bit confused with browsers supporting for the resize action.  In the documentation for that plugin it says that this feature is not supported for Opera:</p>  <pre><code>$('#fileupload').fileupload({     url: '//jquery-file-upload.appspot.com/',     dataType: 'json',     // Enable image resizing, except for Android and Opera,     // which actually support image resizing, but fail to     // send Blob objects via XHR requests:     disableImageResize: /Android(?!.*Chrome)|Opera/         .test(window.navigator &amp;&amp; navigator.userAgent),     imageMaxWidth: 800,     imageMaxHeight: 800,     imageCrop: true // Force cropped images }) </code></pre>  <p>What does it mean? And is there someone who tried to implement resizing for the Opera? </p>
