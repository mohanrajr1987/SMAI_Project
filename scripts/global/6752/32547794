<p>I've discovered this glitch in safari and it is driving me nuts. Its a glitch, because if any of the browser events is fired (hover, click) element takes correct z-index.</p>  <p>The issue is with z-index and position:fixed element.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ht1p6.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ht1p6.png" alt="enter image description here"></a> You can see it live <a href="http://ambebi.weare.de.com/msoplio/129548-tragedia-everestze-chamotsolilma-zvavma-65-alpinisti-imskhverpla.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> scroll down so it gets activated and than slowly scroll up not triggering buttons.</p>  <p>I've discovered that using <code>transform: translatez(1);</code> helps but creates more serious bugs down the line.</p>  <p>any thoughts?</p>
