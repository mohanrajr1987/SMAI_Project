<p>is there any datepicker library that would work in mobile browsers (Android, iOS, Windows phone) and also in standard browsers? It would be perfect if it were compatible with Bootstrap css, and if it could fall-back to native html5 date fields where possible. Please recommend something. I tried  - webshims (broken in Android and IE) - pickadate (not happy with how it behaves)</p>
