<p>Little background:</p>  <p>My web app implements its own 'back' button (using <strong>history.back()</strong>) on the one of the nested Iframes. On one iframe, there is a file upload form.  When a user upload a file, then click on a link to anther page, and then hit back. The the form will be resubmitted with same file name, but <strong>empty</strong> content. This is a significant bug in my app, because it overwrites users' files with empty ones. </p>  <p>Now I need to estimate the potential cost that might have happened to my clients. </p>  <p>I also know the major browsers (mainly Safari, Chrome and Firefox) had the <strong>history.back()</strong> issues at some points. </p>  <p>Could anyone please please please tell me when the history.back() issue addresses for each of the major browsers? </p>  <p>Thank you in advance. </p>
