<p>I have an ordered test that I want to run on Chrome. I have installed all the required Cross-Browser components and have also successfully run a single test method on Chrome.</p>  <p>The issue comes when I try to run an ordered test instead of a single method on chrome. The first test-method of the ordered test runs absolutely fine and once control leaves the first method the browser closes, never going to the second method in the ordered test. So basically I'm not able to run an ordered test. The browser closed after proper execution till the last line in first method, without any exceptions.</p>  <p>If i debug instead of run, i get the message "Service Not Found: DriverService.cs not found" on the very last line of the first method in any ordered test i run.</p>  <pre><code>DriverService.cs not found  You need to find DriverService.cs to view the source for the source for the current call stack frame   You can view disassembly in the Disassembly Window.

Is there anyway to prevent the browser from closing in-between tests ? </p>  <p>VS Version: VS2013 Premium, Update 5. Chrome Version: Version 45.0.2454.93</p>
