<p>I have a link:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;a href="//facebook.com" target="_blank" id="scriptLink"&gt;Click Me!&lt;/a&gt; </code></pre>  <p>And I have this Javascript acting on it:</p>  <pre><code>jQuery(document).ready(function($){     $('#scriptLink').on('click',function(){         window.location.href = '//google.com';      }); }); </code></pre>  <p>I haven't tested every single iOS, but on the iPhone 6 when the link is clicked it will only execute the JavaScript Google link and not the Facebook link. Is there some kind of preventDefault going on here, or am I writing this wrong? I've done some research into these cross-browser JavaScript links, but it seems the solutions the the askers' questions were specific to their use cases.</p>
