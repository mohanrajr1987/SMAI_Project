<p>I have been working as an designer since an year and every time my client forwards me his/her feedback they say "The issue is with font". Though the font styling is same, it seems to be altered when viewing in different browsers. The font used in windows chrome looks bulged or different when viewed on Mac safari. Is it supposed to be the same? If this is supposed to be, then definitely the user will have dual mind towards the quality of the product and definitely will affect the user experience. Its my view towards the font issue I have faced till the date. Looking forward to the geek view :).</p>
