<p>The following Javascript code will attempt to navigate back on a website, or if no previous page exists, navigate to a default URL. After how long is it safe to assume that <code>history.back()</code> has failed across browsers and proceed to another URL without creating a race condition, or it safe to immediately navigate without a timeout?</p>  <pre><code>history.back(); setTimeout(function() {   window.location = '/default'; }, ????); </code></pre>
