<p>has anyone come across this issue before?  In our application we're doing an update to some URLs, through iRules we are now handling the situation where a user attempts to hit /porridge, we now use a 307 code to re-direct them to the new URL /cereal-aisle/porridge.  This therefore works for old links as well as someone using the new link.</p>  <p>However, I've noticed our cross-browser tests which run via saucelabs are failing on a set of tests accessing the old link.  I also ran a few manual sessions on a number of browser/OS configurations and got the same result:      </p>  <pre><code>Bad Gateway (502) - Connection error: An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host... </code></pre>  <p>Has anyone used a similar re-direct and experienced issues or perhaps has it worked without problem?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
