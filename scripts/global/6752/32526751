<p>I'm hanging on a problem for a while now and can't figure it out.  </p>  <p>The problem:  </p>  <p>I have this date string: <code>2015-08-25T08:00:00Z</code></p>  <p>I'm trying to parse this String into a JS Date: <code>var date = new Date( date_string );</code></p>  <p>If I log this:<br> - Chrome: <code>Tue Aug 25 2015 10:00:00 GMT+0200 (CEST)</code><br> - Safari: <code>Tue Aug 25 2015 10:00:00 GMT+0200 (CEST)</code><br> - Firefox: <code>Date 2015-08-25T08:00:00.000Z</code> <strong>(Why is Firefox showing a different time than the other browsers?)</strong>  </p>  <p>But i want them all to show the Date I parse.<br> The other thing is: I don't want the string to be affected by the timezone. Result schould be in all browsers a date with the date of the string.</p>  <p>Also tried to parse with <code>moment.js</code> but even that didn't solve my problem.</p>  <p>Thank you!!</p>
