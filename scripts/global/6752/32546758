<p>Note: I could not think words for this question to search in Google. That's why asking my question. Please bear with me.</p>  <p>I have internet subscription of <code>xyz company</code> and it's login based connection. But what happens is that sometimes login screen reappears and is asking for password. I have already stored user name and password in web page but I have to click on <code>login</code> button to relogin again.</p>  <p>Can I have any script written for this login page that whenever internet connection goes and asks for relogin again, script automatically submit form and get connected with internet?</p>
