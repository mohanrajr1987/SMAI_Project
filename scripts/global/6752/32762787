<p>I'm converting all the images on my website to interlaced, but i found a possible issue, under <em>OSX 10.10.5 and Firefox 38.0.5</em></p>  <p>Interlaced PNGs that are bigger than the browser window (and so they are resized in automatic by the browser) display in a very low quality, like if they are displayed in one of the intermediate layers, and not in the final version. Zooming the image to 100% removes the problem, and changing the browser windows size removes the problem as well.</p>  <p>Here is an example of an interlaced image:</p>  <p><a href="https://trac.ffmpeg.org/attachment/ticket/161/Test_24bpp_interlaced_paeth.png" rel="nofollow">https://trac.ffmpeg.org/attachment/ticket/161/Test_24bpp_interlaced_paeth.png</a></p>  <p>(you have to download it and open with firefox in a small window, so that the image zooms out)</p>  <p>This issue is happening in the 80% of the times I try the same operation.</p>  <p>The issue doesn't appear, instead, in jpeg progressive images.</p>  <p>Could you please confirm me the issue? I think it's very strange that I can't find any other people having my same problem.</p>
