My actual data points are 1072, 1169, 1470, 1539, 1651, 1748, and 1771 (wavenumbers). I understand this has something to do with suppressing the axis and then adding back in one that is desired but I'm not certain where exactly to insert this into my code (see below). diane1 is my data set. Any help appreciated. </p>  <pre><code>E &lt;- ggplot(diane1, aes(x = Wavenumber, y = Absorbance, fill = Study.Group)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge", bin_width=50)   G &lt;- E + labs(title = "Key Absorbance differences before and after treatment", x = "Wavenumber", y = "Absorbance (a.u)")   G + guides(fill = guide_legend(keywidth =2, keyheight = 1, reverse = TRUE)) G + scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1") </code></pre>  <p>Here is what I was hoping to do:</p>  <p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-cVYvajLQ7Zg/Vg_gSCoXu2I/AAAAAAAAARE/qplGagH0sO0/w1012-h770/Rplot01_amended.jpeg" alt=""></p>
