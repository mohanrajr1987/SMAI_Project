<p>here is the problem. I have two lists of vectors, sorted (i hope, but i thing i can sort them if they arent) where ith vector in first list has as many numbers as ith vector in the second list. I just want to plot them. But I fear R cant plot elements of lists. Any ideas how to fix that? Thx a lot. Here is the code i tried.</p>  <pre><code>a&lt;-c(2,1,5) b&lt;-c(2,2,2) f&lt;-c(4) g&lt;-c(1) k&lt;-list(a,f) l&lt;-list(b,g) for(i in 1:2){ plot(l[i],k[i])} </code></pre>  <p>and the issue is</p>  <pre><code>Error in xy.coords(x, y, xlabel, ylabel, log) :  (list) object cannot be coerced to type 'double' </code></pre>
