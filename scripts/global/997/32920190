<p>Im not sure if meshboard is the right one to use.. I barely used matlab before.. please help!!</p>  <p>This is what I want to do: on a circular 2D plane, I have sets of points(x,y-coordinates). And each point has an efficiency value(0~1.0). On the plot, I want the color of the local region of each point to vary according to its efficiency.</p>  <p>For example, when the efficiency is zero, the color is white, when its 1, the color would be red. If the efficiency is between 0~1, the color would also be between white and red(light red).</p>  <p>Thanks in advanced!</p>
