<p>I need to add the following character in the Y-axis label of an Excel 2013 plot: the greek letter xi, with a hat ^ on top, and all that with a subscript of 1. If you are familiar with latex, I need : $\hat{\xi}_1$</p>  <p>I know this can be done easily in other programs, I hate Excel too, but I need it in Excel. Is there a way to actually do this?</p>
