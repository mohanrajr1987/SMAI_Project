<p>I have a simple two column excel data sheet, in the left column I have something like 2010/Jan...2015/Mar in the form yyyy/mmm and in the right column I have random numbers like 185, 201 etc corresponding to these dates. When I import this data to Matlab I get the left column as the type 'cell' and the right column as 'double'. Which is what I would expect. But when I go to plot them using plot function, it says invalid first data argument which is the left column. I assume it is because I can't plot cells with doubles? What do I do to plot these against each other? I would of though it would be simple? I just want those dates on the x-axis, should I convert them to a strings? how so? Thanks in advanced.</p>
