<p>Trying to follow an example made here, I was reproducing the following code:</p>  <pre><code># Load required packages require(GGally)  # Load datasets data(state) df &lt;- data.frame(state.x77,                  State = state.name,                  Abbrev = state.abb,                  Region = state.region,                  Division = state.division )  # Create scatterplot matrix p &lt;- ggpairs(df,               # Columns to include in the matrix              columns = c(3,5,6,7),               # What to include above diagonal              # list(continuous = "points") to mirror              # "blank" to turn off              upper = "blank",              legends=T,               # What to include below diagonal              lower = list(continuous = "points"),               # What to include in the diagonal              diag = list(continuous = "density"),               # How to label inner plots              # internal, none, show              axisLabels = "none",               # Other aes() parameters              colour = "Region",              title = "State Scatterplot Matrix" )   # Show the plot print(p) </code></pre>  <p>I was supposed to get an image with legend for each plot.</p>  <p>But instead, I am getting one without any legend. </p>  <p>Any tips of why the image I am getting does not have the legends? My particular case needs them!</p>  <p>I am using R v. 3.2.2, and tried both in RStudio and RGui. </p>  <p>Thanks in advance! </p>
