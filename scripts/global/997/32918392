<p>I have two plots in an Rmd file that I would like to plot side-by-side in the knitted output. I would also like to save the individual plots to separate pdfs. When I had only one plot per device, <code>dev.copy2pdf</code> worked well to avoid replotting, which I would like to do at all costs.</p>  <p>However, the following code yields two pdfs, neither of which is my desired output. The first pdf is the first plot on the left half of the page; the second pdf is the plots side-by-side. I understand why this is happening - after all, it is copying directly from the current device, but I'm not sure how to modify my code to achieve the result I want.</p>  <pre><code>data(cars) par(mfrow=c(1,2)) plot(cars$Price,cars$Mileage) dev.copy2pdf(file = "price-mileage.pdf") plot(cars$Price,cars$Doors) dev.copy2pdf(file = "price-doors.pdf") </code></pre>
