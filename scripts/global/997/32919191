<p>I am trying to create a bisection method function that will pause for 5 seconds after each iteration and create a plot of the function handle (fcn(x) - this part should be unchanging with each iteration) for which we are solving the roots. Also, it would need markers to indicate the values of fcn(a) and fcn(b) at each iteration. Like I said, I just started at programming, and this is my first post, so I apologize for not being clearer the first time.</p>  <pre><code>function [x] = bisection_solver2(fcn, a, b, tol) format long x = (a + b)/2; error = abs(fcn(x));  while error &gt;= tol     x = (a + b)/2;     error = abs(fcn(x));     if fcn(a)*fcn(x) &gt; 0         a = x;     else         b = x;     end     pause(5);     y = fcn(x);     plot(y) end fprintf('The final solution is %f \n', x) fprintf('The error is %f \n', error)  end </code></pre>  <p>And my input function/arguments are:</p>  <pre><code>[x] = bisection_solver2(@(x)(0.5).*exp(-x/4)*cos(0.2*pi.*x) - 0.12, 1, 3, 0.00002) </code></pre>
