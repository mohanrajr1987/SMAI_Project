<p>I am using the <code>sjPlot</code> package to plot interaction effects and would like to change the confidence intervals in the plots (e.g. from 95 to 90; and to generally have more flexibility), yet I'm unsure how. Here is the base code:</p>  <pre><code>require(sjPlot); require(effects) fit &lt;- lm(weight ~ Diet * Time, data = ChickWeight) sjp.int(fit, type = "eff", showCI = TRUE) </code></pre>  <p>Any and all thoughts would be greatly appreciated. Thanks. </p>
