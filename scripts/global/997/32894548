<p>Given a function <code>f(t, *vargs)</code> of a know variable, but that depends on a set of parameters <code>a1, a2, a3,...</code>, how can I deduce any relation between the parameters effect on the function?</p>  <p>For instance, the function might increase with increasing values for <code>a1</code>, and decrease with increasing values of <code>a2</code>. But if both are changed by the same factor, the function is unaffected. This means that the function really only depends on a factor <code>b = a1/a2</code>. </p>  <p>I want to be able to find such relations between parameters for a given function. To simplify and reduce the possibilities I only want to find dimensionless combinations. That  is, assuming all parameters have the same unit, only combinations giving a unitless result are wanted. E.g. the combination <code>(a1+a2)/a3</code> is something to find, but <code>a1*a2</code> is not.</p>  <p>Is there some way I can implement such a search? I'm thinking that generating different plots and eyeballing any linear graphs may be a way to do it, but how should I go about choosing what to vary and so forth? I plan to implement this in Python, but anything else is just as fine. </p>
