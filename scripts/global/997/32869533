<p>I am starting to work with MATLAB and I still don't know how to do a lot of things. I have to create a simple plot function, let's supose it is:</p>  <pre><code>f(x)=3x+1, defined for example from -5 &lt; x &lt; 5 </code></pre>  <p>What I need to do is to create a function that transforms the independent variable (it's an input parameter). For example, if my function is named <code>plotFunction</code>, if execute the command <code>plotFunction(2x+3)</code> the final plotted graphic is the function:</p>  <pre><code>f(x)=6x+10 </code></pre>
