<p>The following code produces a plot with two lines reffering to the left y-axis and one line referring to the right y-axis. Both plots have their own legend, but I want only one legend listing all 3 lines. I tried to just put the <code>'y1'</code>,<code>'y2'</code> strings into the 2nd <code>legend</code>-command as well, but that didn't work out.</p>  <pre><code>line(x,y1,'b','LineWidth',2)  line(x,y2,'Color',[0,0.6,0.5],'LineWidth',2)  legend('y1','y2');  ax1 = gca; ax2 = axes('Position',ax1.Position,'YAxisLocation','right', 'Color','none','YColor',[255,127,80]/256); linkaxes([ax1,ax2],'x');  line(x,y3,'Parent',ax2,'LineWidth',2,'Color',[255,127,80]/256)  legend('y3') </code></pre>
