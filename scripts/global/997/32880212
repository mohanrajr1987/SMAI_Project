<p>I want to use basic graphs to <code>1:10</code> where the point shape alternate between a plus sign (i.e. <code>+</code>) and a triangle.</p>  <p>It might appear that the following code <code>plot(1:10, pch = c("+",2))</code> will work.  This is because <code>pch=2</code> corresponds to the triangle.  The code, however, yields:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Fsh0I.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Fsh0I.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>This of course occurs because the <code>c()</code> function coerces the <code>2</code> to a character.  My question is, how would I pass both a string and an integer to pch? </p>  <p>Thanks! </p>
