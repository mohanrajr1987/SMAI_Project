<p>I am taking a circuits class and for lab we need to do a little work with MATLAB to plot some of the results.  I got the following code which I used to generate a Bode plot of the transfer function for a filter we were designing.  I sort of get how it works but I don't really know or use MATLAB outside of this class.</p>  <pre><code>clc; close all s=tf('s'); w=628*1000; H=(1/(1 + 1.85*s/w + s^2/w^2))*(1/(1 + 0.77*s/w + s^2/w^2)); figure; bode(H) </code></pre>  <p>This worked fine but now I need to plot the transfer function I measured in the lab against this data on the SAME plot axis.  How can I plot both of them together.  I have the lab data as a list of gain frequency pairs.</p>
