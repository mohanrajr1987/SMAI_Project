<p>I am using caret's train function in R to produce a model using GBM. I have used repeated cross-validation with 5 repititions meaning there will be 50 samples. I want to ask if there is a way to plot the results in a different way such that the plot shows the boosting iterations on the x-axis and auc on the y-axis and inside it shows the results obtained from the best parameter selection but a separate line for training folds and test folds. This can be produced when you use "gbm" function from the gbm package and use "gbm.perf" along with sampling technique to plot the training and validation curve for deviance.</p>  <p>Is it possible to do the same with caret's train function somehow?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
