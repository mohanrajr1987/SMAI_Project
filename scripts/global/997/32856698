<p>In RStudio, we can adjust the size of 4 windows (or panels): text editor, console, environment/history, files/plots/packages/help/viewer.</p>  <p>I frequently export plots from RStudio and paste it in MS Word or save it as an image file. My concern is that the size of the plot is different every time because I often adjust the size of panels as I need.</p>  <p>Is there any way that I adjust the panels' sizes to the same sizes that I did before after I randomly adjust the panel sizes? If I can specify the panel size by numbers, then I can do it, but RStudio does not provide such feature.</p>
