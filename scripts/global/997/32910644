<p>I'm working with a binary classification (2 classes: A and B) and I'm interested in plotting the learning curves but only in relation to one of the classes, say B, which is the rare class. Is that possible to be done with scikit-learn? What I've a plotted so far is the F1, which is an F1 average for the 2 classes but I don't see a way for just plotting the scores for each individually.</p>
