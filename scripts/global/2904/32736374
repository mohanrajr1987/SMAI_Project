<p>I am using <a href="http://au.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/17204-kernel-density-estimation/content/kde2d.m" rel="nofollow">this</a> function to estimate kernel density in 2D. I am slightly confused by the parameters of this function however.</p>  <p>Here is an example, viewed from directly above, where density is being calculated at each point (O) in the figure. i.e: over very small areas.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/qrmkx.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/qrmkx.png" alt="density test"></a></p>  <p>I want to change the KDE function parameters so that density is computed over a larger area (for example, the area circled in red). Which parameters do I need to change? I presume it is one (or both) of these: </p>  <p>"n: size of the n by n grid over which the density is computed (default 2^8)"</p>  <p>OR: </p>  <p>"MIN_XY, MAX_XY: limits of the bounding box over which the density is computed". The default limits are computed as: </p>  <pre><code>MAX = max(data,[],1);  MIN = min(data,[],1);  Range = MAX-MIN;  MAX_XY = MAX+Range/4;  MIN_XY = MIN-Range/4; </code></pre>  <p>Thanks very much.</p>
