<p>I am really having a problem understanding dynamically allocated arrays. </p>  <p>I am attempting to read a text file of strings to a 2d array so I can sort them out later. right now as my code stands it throws seg faults every once in a while. Which means I'm doing something wrong. I've been surfing around trying to get a better understanding of what malloc actually does but I want to test and check if my array is being filled. </p>  <p>my program is pulling from a text file with nothing but strings and I am attempting to put that data into a 2d array. </p>  <pre><code>for(index = 0; index &lt; lines_allocated; index++){ //for loop to fill array 128 lines at a time(arbitrary number)     words[index] = malloc(sizeof(char));     if(words[index] == NULL){         perror("too many characters");         exit(2);     }     //check for end of file     while(!feof(txt_file)) {         words = fgets(words, 64, txt_file);         puts(words);         //realloc if nessesary         if (lines_allocated == (index - 1)){             realloc(words, lines_allocated + lines_allocated);         }     }  } //get 3rd value placed printf("%s", words[3]); </code></pre>  <p>since this just a gist, below here ive closed and free'd the memory, The output is being displayed using puts, but not from the printf from the bottom. an ELI5 version of reading files to an array would be amazing. </p>  <p>Thank you in advance </p>
