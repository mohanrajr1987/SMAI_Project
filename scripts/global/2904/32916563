<p>basically I want to be able to store a 2D array such as this</p>  <pre><code>int [][] preferredMoves = {             {0,0}, {0, arrLength}, {length%2, arrLength},             {0, length%2}, {arrLength, 0}, {0, length%2},              {arrLength, arrLength}, {length%2, length%2},             {arrLength, length%2}, {length%2, 0}     }; </code></pre>  <p>In a single </p>  <pre><code>int [] moves;  </code></pre>  <p>array.</p>  <p>I'm sure this is possible since I'm just storing a list..., but I can't seem to find information on this anywhere... or maybe its not possible? </p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong> I am dealing with matrices. I want to store the list in a single array to then return that array to use it elsewhere.</p>  <p>So then every time I call it, all I have to do is something like this...</p>  <pre><code>int row = Computer.moves()[0];     int col = Computer.moves()[1]; </code></pre>  <p>I also need to loop through that single array, which contains the 2D array multiple times..</p>
