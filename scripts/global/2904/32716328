<p>Hope you can help. Still trying to get my head round java!  </p>  <p>I have the contents of a text file I want to store (and use later) into a 2D arraylist. The text file example would look like this (an indeterminate number of entries on an indeterminate number of lines):</p>  <p>dog,cat,monkey,elephant<br> chip,sausage,beans,mouse,ant<br> anything,whatever,some object,dunno,every line has a different,number of values</p>  <p>I want to be able to print out the text file just as it stands but with the items neatly stored in my 2D arraylist (biD)<br> e.g.:</p>  <p>dog|cat|monkey|elephant|<br> chip|sausage|beans|mouse|ant|<br> anything|whatever|some object|dunno|every line has a different|number of values|  </p>  <p>But when I run the program below I get:</p>  <p>col is 15<br> dog|cat|monkey|elephant|chip|sausage|beans|mouse|ant|anything|whatever|some object|dunno|every line has a different|number of values|<br> dog|cat|monkey|elephant|chip|sausage|beans|mouse|ant|anything|whatever|some object|dunno|every line has a different|number of values|<br> dog|cat|monkey|elephant|chip|sausage|beans|mouse|ant|anything|whatever|some object|dunno|every line has a different|number of values|      </p>  <p>i.e. each line in the txt file (there are 3 in this case) seems to produce an entry in the biD structure that contains ALL of the lines in the txt file. Really, each printed line should contain only one lines' items from the txt file.</p>  <p>Here is the code:  </p>  <pre><code>import java.io.File;   import java.io.FileNotFoundException;   import java.util.ArrayList;   import java.util.Arrays;   import java.util.Scanner;    public class testData {      private static Scanner file;     static int rows;      public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException {         ArrayList&lt;ArrayList&lt;String&gt;&gt; biD = new ArrayList&lt;ArrayList&lt;String&gt;&gt;();         file = new Scanner(new File("C:/tmp/text.txt"));         ArrayList&lt;String&gt; line = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();          while (file.hasNextLine()) {             final String nextLine = file.nextLine();             final String[] items = nextLine.split(",");              for (int i = 0; i &lt; items.length; i++) {                 line.add(items[i]);             }              biD.add(line);             rows++;             Arrays.fill(items, null); // to clear out the 'items' array         }          int col = biD.get(0).size();         System.out.println("col is " + col);          for (int i = 0; i &lt; rows; i++) {             for (int j = 0; j &lt; biD.get(i).size(); j++) {                 System.out.print(biD.get(i).get(j) + "|");              }             System.out.println();         }      }  } </code></pre>  <p>So basically my biD structure seems to be storing too much info.</p>  <p>So a walkthough (I thought) would be:</p>  <p>Read a line from the file<br> store in a string (nextLine)<br> split the string and store the items in a string array (items)<br> Add the items to an arraylist (line)<br> add that arraylist to the arraylist biD.<br> (which is where I'm going wrong I think. Probably not understanding how arraylists work properly I think!)  </p>  <p>Any ideas, Anyone?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
