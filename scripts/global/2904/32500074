<p>Is there a posibility to calculate the lines of a 2d <code>char</code> array?</p>  <p><strong>Context:</strong> </p>  <p>I've read names out of a csv file and i want to calculate with the numbers behind it. </p>  <p><strong>Pseudocode:</strong> </p>  <pre><code>int workers = size of the 2d char array (a_name) </code></pre>  <p><code>workers = sizeof(a_name)</code> is obviously not working.</p>
