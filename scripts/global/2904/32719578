<p>I'd like to know if it's possible to apply a function (or juste an operation, such as replacing values) to column in a python 2d array, without using for loops. </p>  <p>I'm sorry if the question has already been asked, but I couldn't find anything specific about my problem.</p>  <p>I'd like to do something like :</p>  <pre><code>array[:][2] = 1 </code></pre>  <p>Which would mean <em>put 1 for each value at the third column</em>, or</p>  <pre><code>func(array[:][2]) </code></pre>  <p>Which would mean <em>apply <code>func()</code> to the third row of array</em>.</p>  <p>Is there any magic python-way to do it ?</p>  <p>EDIT : The truth has been spoken. I forgot to say that I didn't want to avoid <code>for()</code> statement to improve performance, but just because I don't wan to add multiples lines for this precise instance. We got 2 answers here, one in a native way, and two more with the help of Numpy. Thanks a lot for your answers !</p>
