<p>I have manually generated a depthmap based on the vertices of my 3D-Model (no, i can't use the z-buffer in this case).</p>  <p>Unfortunately the depthmap is like a patchwork with many holes. This is how it looks like: </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZHCKr.png" rel="nofollow">http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZHCKr.png</a></p>  <p>I somehow want to interpolate those missing holes, but i've never done something like this before and don't know how to approach this problem. </p>  <p>I was thinking about bicubic / bilinear interpolation.  Is that what i need to apply to my problem?</p>  <p>If so, can you please explain to me how to undertake this approach? If that sort of interpolation is not the right one, how can i solve this hole problem?</p>
