<p>Here is the code: <a href="http://hastebin.com/ugufakeyap.java" rel="nofollow">http://hastebin.com/ugufakeyap.java</a></p>  <p>When I run this, the sprite "aspectRatios" is not displayed on the screen. But when I pause the program by pressing my home button and then resuming the program, it displays the sprite onto the screen. Why is this? It's really annoying.</p>
