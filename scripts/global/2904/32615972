<p>I am trying to move a gameobject with a defined path. I have used iTweenpath and successfully implemented it, but the problem is when I choose a curve path my gameobject do not rotate according to path. My project is 2d so only Z axis will work for rotation.</p>  <p>Below is the code :-</p>  <pre><code>                iTween.MoveTo(gameObject , iTween.Hash("path" ,                  iTweenPath.GetPath("CurvePath") , "time" , 10                   ,"orienttopath", true , "lookahead", 1.0f ,"axis", "z")); </code></pre>
