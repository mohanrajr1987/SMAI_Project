<p>I'm developing a Tower defense in 2D in Unity.</p>  <p>I'm trying to calculate a parabola to draw the trajectory of the projectiles fired from a tower in the game. I've got the position of the tower and the position of the enemy - now I need an algorithm that calculates a parabola that will hit the enemy.</p>  <p>Is there a universal algorithm or something like that for this kind of calculation?</p>
