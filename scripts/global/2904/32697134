<p>I am attempting to draw a point from a 2d plane on a 3d plane that is drawn in 2d.  I'm not sure how to adjust the y position based on the angle of the perspective.  As you can see in the image linked below (Stack Overflow won't let me include the image because I just signed up), if the point is at the center point of the rectangle, it would need to be shifted up slightly when viewed from an angle to account for distance from the viewer.  Can anyone provide an equation to help?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/haigp.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/haigp.png" alt="Example Image"></a></p>
