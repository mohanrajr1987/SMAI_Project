<p>I'm using Three.js to render a number of 2D objects (<code>THREE.PlaneGeometry</code>) arranged in layers. All of them should be aligned on the same flat plane, but with some objects "in front of" or "blocking the view of" others. In other words, I want to simulate the CSS <code>z-index</code> property, but without actually using the <code>z</code>-dimension, because that would cause perspective issues.</p>  <p>Does Three.js have a facility for this?</p>
