<p>Ok, I'm a programming student at university and I've came across this issue while creating my 2D Star Wars X-Wing Game. The Ship is constantly changing direction to avoid incoming TieFighters and I have been able to create a missile in front of the X-Wing. </p>  <p>The issue is that I don't know how to fire the missile in the direction the ship is facing.</p>  <p>Code for placing missile:</p>  <pre><code>if (pInputs-&gt;KeyPressed(DIK_SPACE)) {     Vector2D missileDirection;  //Section needs fixed as missile spawns inside ship and destroys it.     missileDirection.setBearing(m_angle, 100);     Vector2D missilePosition = m_position + missileDirection;     FlakShell* pFlakShell = new FlakShell;     pFlakShell-&gt;Initialise(missilePosition, m_angle, m_pParticles);     Game::instance.m_objects.AddItem(pFlakShell, true); } </code></pre>  <p>This is the velocity for the <code>FlakShell(missile)</code>:</p>  <pre><code>m_velocity.set(0, 0); </code></pre>  <p>and this is the code I have to make it move:</p>  <pre><code>m_velocity += m_velocity * 1.5f * frametime; m_position += m_velocity * frametime; //Position is equal to velocity * frametime </code></pre>  <p>Can anyone help me?</p>
