<p>Looking for pseudo-code for creating a visual representation of a binary tree using 2D volume as data source.</p>  <p><strong>Task:</strong> Convert an associative array containing <strong>name</strong> and <strong>volume</strong> data to a visual 2D chart that <em>automatically makes the decision to split volumes</em> according to how much space is left for each subsequent <em>area</em> contained within the list.</p>  <p><strong>Assumptions:</strong> Aware of root/parent structure. (Can have one root, but multiple large blocks, containing smaller blocks within. Can represent, HD folder structure, for example.)</p>  <p>Example of the resulting chart and associated data: The visual chart is the proverbial output of the pseudo code that would be required in order to solve this problem.</p>  <p><strong>Ps:</strong> I couldn't find this elsewhere on StackOverflow. Has anyone done this before?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/1f7XV.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/1f7XV.jpg" alt="Output"></a></p>  <p>The most elegant solution that I have found so far in a real-world application was <strong>WinDirStat</strong>:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/wSe5H.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/wSe5H.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Can anyone come up with pseudo code for something like this?</p>
