<p>I don't know if here is the right place to post this kind of question, but I need some help to choose a software for creating a 2D video.</p>  <p>I need to make something like this video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbru-y93Wa4" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbru-y93Wa4</a> and I'm wondering if these guys used a video template or they created it in Adobe After Effects.</p>
