<p>I have used AndEngine before, and now started to learn Cocos2D-x. But I wonder how to get rid of these game engines and build my own engine. I mean writing a new simple 2D game engine using OpenGL. </p>  <p>I also wonder the production method of those games on Google Play Store, with an engine or without a game engine? I think many of them are made without an engine, but how can it be done?</p>
