<p>I am trying to find a recursive solution to the following problem but I am completely stuck.  I have a 2d array sized nxn that contains only values between 0-9. I would like to find how many DIFFERENT values there are in the array and return that result. The function would look like this:  int numOfValues(int[][] map). For the following example the function would return 5 since the values appearing here are 0,1,2,3 and 4. If the array is null the function will return 0.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/bhZuP.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/bhZuP.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
