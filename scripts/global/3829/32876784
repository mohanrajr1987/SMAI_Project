<p>If you have a table schema that has 40 different employees and the query produces anywhere from 200 to 1,000 results per employee (ending up with a total of somewhere around 20,000 rows in full) -- is there a way to use the <code>LIMIT</code> function to automatically limit the resulting query to 100 rows <em>per</em> employee? Obviously the <code>LIMIT</code> function can easily limit the rows for the entire query -- but I was hoping that there'd be a way to maybe use <code>GROUP BY</code> to grab the top 100 rows per employee.</p>  <p>Something like this where the 'target' is the name of the person the employee would be responsible for and the score is how well they did from 1-100 -- but where the limit would be 100 for each employee, resulting in 4,000 rows total:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT employee, target, score FROM t1 WHERE score &gt; 60 ORDER BY score DESC LIMIT 4000; </code></pre>  <p>That result's obviously skewed because it doesn't give me 100 per employee -- it just gives me the top 4,000 scores, regardless if 1,000 of them fell to one employee and if two or three fell to another.</p>  <p>My ideal result would have some form of <code>LIMIT 100</code> but grouped by all the different employees -- which is something I'm not sure how to do. Thanks!</p>
