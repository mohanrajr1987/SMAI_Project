<p>I have a table that holds a <strong>student_id</strong> and a datetime timestamp (<strong>log_time</strong>) of when they arrived at school.</p>  <p>I have built a query that lists the student_id alongside the time they arrived for the current week. How can I combine the results so for example from the data below student_id 4211 shows on one line with the time in tuesday, wednesday and thursday? Using GROUP BY only shows one time. I need to somehow group by the student_id but combine the day times.</p>  <pre><code>SELECT     student_id,     if( (DAYOFWEEK(log_time)=2)=0, '-', DATE_FORMAT(log_time,'%H:%i:%s') ) AS monday_time,     if( (DAYOFWEEK(log_time)=3)=0, '-', DATE_FORMAT(log_time,'%H:%i:%s') ) AS tuesday_time,     if( (DAYOFWEEK(log_time)=4)=0, '-', DATE_FORMAT(log_time,'%H:%i:%s') ) AS wednesday_time,     if( (DAYOFWEEK(log_time)=5)=0, '-', DATE_FORMAT(log_time,'%H:%i:%s') ) AS thursday_time,     if( (DAYOFWEEK(log_time)=6)=0, '-', DATE_FORMAT(log_time,'%H:%i:%s') ) AS friday_time FROM     tbl_student_register WHERE     YEARWEEK(`log_time`, 1) = YEARWEEK(CURDATE(), 1)  </code></pre>  <p>This will give the following result from my data</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/NiYe4.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/NiYe4.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
