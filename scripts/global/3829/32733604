<p>I have a table with 20 columns. I need to group them by all columns except the last one.</p>  <pre><code>SELECT att1, att2, att3, ..., att19, sum(att20) FROM table GROUP BY att1, att2, att3, ..., att19; </code></pre>  <p>But is there a shorter way to write it instead of listing all attributes?</p>  <p>I tried</p>  <pre><code>SELECT 1,2,3,...,19, sum(att20) FROM table GROUP BY 1,2,3,...,19; </code></pre>  <p>I wonder if there is something like</p>  <pre><code>SELECT * (except att20), sum(att20) FROM table GROUP BY * (except att20); </code></pre>
