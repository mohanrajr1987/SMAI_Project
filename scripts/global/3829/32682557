<p>The following query successfully returns the specific users (by id) who have printed the most:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT file_prints.user_id, user.major, sum(print_pages) FROM `file_prints` INNER JOIN `user` on file_prints.user_id = user.user_id GROUP BY file_prints.user_id  ORDER BY sum(print_pages) </code></pre>  <p>When I introduce a where clause to try to eliminate the users who have not printed at all (that is to say, where sum(print_pages) == 0), I write the following query:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT file_prints.user_id, user.major, sum(print_pages) FROM `file_prints` INNER JOIN `user` on file_prints.user_id = user.user_id WHERE sum(print_pages) &gt; 0 GROUP BY file_prints.user_id  ORDER BY sum(print_pages) </code></pre>  <p>and get the following error:</p>  <pre><code> #1111 - Invalid use of group function  </code></pre>  <p>How do I eliminate the results which have 0 for sum(print_pages)?</p>
