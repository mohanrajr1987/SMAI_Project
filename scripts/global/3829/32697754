<p>I am trying to create a diverse group of people from a database. For example I have following data</p>  <pre><code>1. Male, PhD, Computer Science, German, age: 34, no experience 2. Male, Masters, Biology, Austrian, age: 39, no experience 3. Female, Masters, Biology, Swiss, age: 20,  experienced 4. Male, PhD, Biology, German, age: 28,  experienced 5. Female, PhD, Computer Science, American, age: 29, no experience 6. Male, Masters, Biology, Canadian, age: 21, no experience 7. Male, Bachelors, Computer Science, Asian, age: 20, experienced 8. Female, Bachelors, Computer Science, Indian, age: 20, no experience </code></pre>  <p>I want to create groups of 4 students with most diverse characteristics plus a condition that two bachelors cannot be in the same group.  Diversity means; we want to have a balance of PhD and Master students in both groups, we want to have male female ratio in the group almost similar, however, for age we want to keep the OLD ones TOGETHER and younger ones TOGETHER. Obviously it cannot be that we can find totally diverse group, but we should be able to follow the diversity as much as possible...</p>
