<p>I have an integer column which signifies a type of the model</p>  <p>If I do <code>Model.group(:type_model).count</code> for charting purposes I get a </p>  <pre><code>{1 =&gt; 3 2 =&gt; 53 3 =&gt; 11} </code></pre>  <p>Which by itself is fine, but it has no meaning. How can I replace the model type number with it's name (assuming I have a <code>name_of_type(int)</code> method)</p>  <p>I can map the hash and go over each key, but is there a better way to do this?</p>
