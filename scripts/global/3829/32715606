<p>I have 2 tables with data of invoices like date invoice no. supplier etc. First table differs from another that's why they are creates as separated tables. However both table have identical column which I wanted to UNION and GROUP BY.</p>  <p>When I am doing things with one table everything is OK but when trying to UNION I get separated group by data for example if it is grouped by client and country I get two countries (BE and below also BE) of the same client. Result should provide me only one country with summed VATamount.</p>  <p>I read some articles on the Internet however it does not help me with my problem. So far my syntax looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT [Faktury - od nas].customerKey, [Faktury - od nas].InvoiceCountry, Sum([Faktury - od nas].VATamount) AS SumaOfVATamount FROM [Faktury - od nas] GROUP BY [Faktury - od nas].customerKey, [Faktury - od nas].InvoiceCountry UNION SELECT [Faktury - od nich].customerKey, [Faktury - od nich].InvoiceCountry, Sum([Faktury - od nich].VATamount) AS SumaOfVATamount FROM [Faktury - od nich] GROUP BY [Faktury - od nich].customerKey, [Faktury - od nich].InvoiceCountry </code></pre>  <p>So far output:</p>  <p>01-72 --- BE --- 125,00 <br> 01-72 --- BE --- 180,07 <br> 11-54 --- DE --- 206,34 <br> 11-54 --- DE --- 100,00 <br> 23-65 --- FR ---  23,00 <br> 23-65 --- FR --- 100,76 <br></p>  <p>Desired output:</p>  <p>01-72 --- BE --- 305,07 <br> 11-54 --- DE --- 306,34 <br> 23-65 --- FR --- 123,76 <br></p>
