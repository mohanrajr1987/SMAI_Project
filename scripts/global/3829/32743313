<p>I have 3 Data Frames (df_1, df_2 &amp; df_3) all with very similar data. Their design is shown below:</p>  <pre><code>                             col1                    col2     col3                          mean       std         mean        std mean std     T1             6.845490  0.591227   374.752941  12.866451    4   0    T2                  NaN       NaN          NaN        NaN  NaN NaN    T3            19.598690  0.319181  1121.894048  26.443062    4   0    T4            21.555500  0.246757  1281.250000  20.254473    4   0    T5            34.980000  0.518170  2391.961453  20.896245    4   0    T6            37.245000  0.209284  2477.650000   7.720815    4   0    T7            40.220541  0.322800  2599.500901  14.672928    4   0  </code></pre>  <p>Sometimes there is data missing from these tables i.e entire T# rows have been known to disappear. How ever df_3 always has a full set of T# in the first column. </p>  <p>Across all three DF's the col1, col2 and so on have the same names (so could potentially be merged?). The only thing that changes is the numerated data below. </p>  <p>What I would like to do is group the data in a way that I can plot <code>col1, mean</code> for <code>df1,2&amp;3</code> on a bar chart for every T#. Then the same for <code>col2</code> on a separate graph and so on. (There's 30 cols roughly). The <code>std</code> will be used for error bars.</p>  <p>Something that looks like this, <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/3DHTs.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/3DHTs.png" alt="where the col1 is now hRideR"></a></p>  <p>I originally tried a concat but if became too difficult to separate the data afterwards and I struggled with using a <code>.loc</code> function.</p>  <p>Before I used this:</p>  <pre><code>df_AllCorners = pd.concat([df_1, df_2, df_3], axis = 1, join_axes[df_3.index]) </code></pre>  <p>This got all 3 in the same DF with all correct data but I was unable to pull the data back out again. I ended up with repeating column names which was confusing the program. I.E.</p>  <pre><code>                   col1                   col2  ...      col1                          mean       std         mean  ...      mean          std                                                    ...                      T1             6.845490  0.591227   374.752941  ... 12.866451     4.256346       T2                  NaN       NaN          NaN  ...       NaN          NaN     T3            19.598690  0.319181  1121.894048  ... 26.443062     9.362913       T4            21.555500  0.246757  1281.250000  ... 20.254473    21.252643      T5            34.980000  0.518170  2391.961453  ... 20.896245    18.126319      T6            37.245000  0.209284  2477.650000  ...  7.720815    10.312568       T7            40.220541  0.322800  2599.500901  ... 14.672928     3.256167 </code></pre>  <p>The second col1 is for the next DF but because they share titles I get errors like this: <code>Exception: cannot handle a non-unique multi-index</code></p>  <p>It's also worth mentioning that the data in the DF's will change a lot, as will the names of the columns. I have changed them for ease of description. So I'm assuming they will have to be called in form of <code>[i]</code>    </p>  <p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank You.</p>
