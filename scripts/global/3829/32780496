<p>I have a table with orders and a table with users. It's possible for an order to be placed with an entry in the user table.</p>  <p>With the following MySQL statement I get duplicate values for orders if there is a matching user:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT o.id, u.id as 'user_id', u.name FROM orders o LEFT JOIN users u ON o.user_id = u.id WHERE o.status = 'active' </code></pre>  <p>If I add a <code>GROUP BY o.id</code> it solves the issue.</p>  <pre><code>SELECT o.id, u.id as 'user_id' FROM orders o LEFT JOIN users u ON o.user_id = u.id WHERE o.status = 'active' GROUP BY o.id </code></pre>  <p>It also works if I use <code>SELECT DISTINCT</code>.</p>  <p>My questions are:</p>  <ol> <li>Why does it return duplicate fields?</li> <li>Is it more correct to use GROUP BY or SELECT DISTINCT?</li> </ol>
