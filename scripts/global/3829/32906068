<p>This is what I have and below what I want to do. <code>d</code>. is a table, and <code>act</code> is a view that consists of about 50 combined tables:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT d.extensionaspect1                 AS "Exception ID",         d.causedat                         AS "Date",        max(act.date_)                     AS "Causedate",        act.prodsteppath                   AS "Production Step",         --I'm calling other selections on d, but i'm not going to incude        --them for the sake of clarity  FROM   pasx.deviationevent d,        pasx.vtemp_prodsteppath act        --There's more here, but I'm not going to include them for the sake of clarity  WHERE  act.date_ &lt; d.causedat        --as before, there's a large amount of AND clauses here that make        --sure that I get the timestamps I want. This is a pretty complex query  GROUP BY d.causedat, ORDER BY d.extensionaspect1; </code></pre>  <p>Running like this gives me ORA-00936; missing expression. I'm very new at this, so I'm probably fundamentally misunderstanding how to use <code>select max(act.date_)</code> and use it to find the timestamp that occurred just before <code>d.causedate</code>. <code>act.date_</code> contains all the possible timestamps that could lead to throwing an exception, but only the one before the timestamps in d.causedat are relevant to me.</p>  <p><code>vtemp_prodsteppath</code> is a view and contains no order or group by's. How do I join these two tables (<code>d</code> and <code>act</code>) together? What expression am I missing? </p>
