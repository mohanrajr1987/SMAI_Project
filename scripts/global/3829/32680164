<p>I have the below code which brings though a sum of where a day 'GRLastDt' has complete or not complete however I hadn't accounted for duplicated Return IDs. Is there a way to return a sum by day for each Return ID?</p>  <p>For example day 24/5/15 may have 5 Lines to the day which have 'X' in Complete however 2 lines have duplicated return ids 'RtnId' and therefore the sum total would be 4 rather than 5 for 24/5/15.</p>  <pre><code>SELECT       CONVERT(varchar(15), GRLastDt, 111) AS Date_,     SUM(CASE WHEN Complete = 'X' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Complete,      SUM(CASE WHEN Complete &lt;&gt; 'X' /*and RtnDt &lt;&gt;GRLastDt*/THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Due FROM [dbo].[vw_AN_Admin_VendorReturns] WHERE (GRLastDt &gt;= GETDATE() - 30)    GROUP BY CONVERT(varchar(15), GRLastDt, 111),GRLastDt </code></pre>
