<p>I am trying to query a dataset from a single table, which contains quiz answers/entries from multiple users.  I want to pull out the highest scoring entry from each individual user.</p>  <p>My data looks like the following:</p>  <pre><code>ID  TP_ID               quiz_id name                num_questions   correct     incorrect   percent     created_at 1   10154312970149546   1       Joe                 3               2           1           67          2015-09-20 22:47:10 2   10154312970149546   1       Joe                 3               3           0           100         2015-09-21 20:15:20 3   125564674465289     1       Test User           3               1           2           33          2015-09-23 08:07:18 4   10153627558393996   1       Bob                 3               3           0           100         2015-09-23 11:27:02 </code></pre>  <p>My query looks like the following:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT *    FROM `entries`  WHERE       `TP_ID` IN('10153627558393996', '10154312970149546')  GROUP BY    `TP_ID`  ORDER BY    `correct` DESC </code></pre>  <p>In my mind, what that should do is get the two users from the <code>IN</code> clause, order them by the number of <code>correct</code> answers and then group them together, so I should be left with the 2 highest scores from those two users.</p>  <p>In reality it's giving me two results, but the one from Joe gives me the lower of the two values (2), with Bob first with a score of 3.  Swapping to ASC ordering keeps the scores the same but places Joe first.</p>  <p>So, how could I achieve what I need?</p>
