<p>The table returns correct nrow, ncol and no issues in running the script, but if I also try write.table on the table I get the same error as knitr:kable throws up: Error in <code>[&lt;-.data.frame</code>(<code>*tmp*</code>, , j, value = structure(c(0.164, 0.397, : replacement has 106 rows, data has 17 - so they agree on something. I've tried library(dplyr) as suggested in one post, but no help, and if it's in the sourced script I would have thought it's not necessary. Also tried re-working the group_by /summarise sequence but to no avail Very grateful for assistance, Neil</p>
