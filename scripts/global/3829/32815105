<p>I have some messy data in text files (2 tables). I'd like to merge it into 1 table but there are duplication issues. My data looks like the following:  </p>  <p><em>Status table</em>  </p>  <pre><code>+--------------------------+ | | Last Name | Status  |  | +--------------------------+ | | Jones     | On Time |  | | | Jones     | On Time |  | | | Jones     | On Time |  | | | Jones     | On Time |  | | | Jones     | Missing |  | | | Hoinski   | On Time |  | | | Hoinski   | Late    |  | | | Hoinski   | Late    |  | | | Hoinski   | Missing |  | +--------------------------+   </code></pre>  <p><em>Risk table</em>  </p>  <pre><code>+-------------------------+ | | Last Name |  Risk  |  | +-------------------------+ | | Jones     | High   |  | | | Jones     | High   |  | | | Jones     | Low    |  | | | Jones     | Medium |  | | | Jones     | Medium |  | | | Jones     | Medium |  | | | Jones     | Medium |  | | | Smith     | Low    |  | | | Smith     | Medium |  | | | Smith     | Medium |  | | | Smith     | Medium |  | | | Hoinski   | High   |  | | | Hoinski   | High   |  | | | Hoinski   | Low    |  | +-------------------------+   </code></pre>  <p>How can I use sql to aggregate these two tables into 1 table? Is it possible? I know I do not have a proper relationship (many to many) so it doesn't quite make sense. But what if I aggregate the data using Group By statements on the [last name] field?</p>
