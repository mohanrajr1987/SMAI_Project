<p>I work on automation using PowerShell scripts for our clients. The client base involves different servers of Windows OS some use PowerShell v2.0 and few are using latter versions including v3.0 and higher.</p>  <p>While writing scripts I am using PowerShell V3.0 due to its fancy ISE and intellisense features. However, in some cases scripts work well on my machine and fail on the client machines since they are using v2.0. I need to find some way to make it compatible with v2.0 by changing the code again.</p>  <p>I am looking for some way to find out all the alternative ways for the features that work on v3.0 but not on v2.0. For example -in and -notin are not supported on v2.0, and I found some workaround on this site for using -contains and -notcontains.</p>  <p>Can someone direct me to a place to refer where I can find all such workarounds or at least the list of features that are not supported on v2.0 vs. v3.0.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
