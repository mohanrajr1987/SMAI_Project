<p>I am attempting to bootstrap some powershell scrips in Chef via powershell_script resources in my Chef Cookbook.  When I run locally using Chef-Client everything works as "expected".  Then I trigger this same cookbook via OpsWorks against a new EC2 instance and the cookbook runs successfully, with the powershell returning a 0 return code, but none of the powershell code is actually executed.  When I create an RDP session and run this same script manually on the new EC2 instance everything again runs as expected.  There are no logs providing details on the skipped execution and no errors in the Chef run logs or in the Windows Event Log.  Can anyone point me in a direction to trouble shoot or solve this issue?</p>
