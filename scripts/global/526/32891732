<p>I'm a total noob in PowerShell and I wanted to pass a string containing a null character to a command (openssl here in the current working directory):</p>  <pre><code>powershell -command "&amp; { \"`0myemail@gmail.com`0mypassword\" | %cd%\openssl enc -base64 }" </code></pre>  <p>The thing is I'm getting my string encoded with as if it was passed with a carriage return and a new line characters at the end of it.</p>  <p>What am I missing?</p>
