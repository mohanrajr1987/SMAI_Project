<p>I have what may or may not be a unique issue (but probably not) with what I'm sure is a (relatively) simple solution.  My organization manages several schools across 3 different regions.  I am working on a PS script to go through all of our Users and Computers in AD and find the people machines that are disabled and move them.  The problem lies in the fact that NOT ALL disabled account should be moved as we use Exchange for Rooms &amp; Technology, which are accounts that stay disabled.  What I need to do is to use Get-ADUser and only look at accounts in the "Users" OU at each site.  I know how to do this if I'm just hitting 1 site:</p>  <pre><code>Get-ADUser -SearchBase “OU=Users, OU=SiteName, OU=Region, OU=Company,dc=Company,dc=org” | Select Name,SamAccountName </code></pre>  <p>But because we have multiple sites over 3 locations, each with its own "Users" OU, I'm not sure the best way to attack this.  Perhaps I shouldn't use SearchBase?</p>  <p>My hope is that there's a way to do this with a wildcard or something in the Get-ADUser statement, but my instinct is to scrip it with a for loop that somehow pulls the regions, and then the sites, and have that go through, but I'm not really sure if that's right, or how to actually pull that data into an array properly.</p>
