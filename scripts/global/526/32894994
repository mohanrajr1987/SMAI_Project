<p>We are currently experiencing issues with selective user accounts switching from All Computers, to The Following Computers under Logon Workstations in Active Directory. </p>  <p>I'd like to have a way to have a spreadsheet (CSV) that contains usernames, and then run the PowerShell script would read these values and set each user to All Computers under Logon Workstation.</p>  <p>Now, here is a simple script that works perfectly fine - Only thing is that you would have to enter each username manually each time you run this command:</p>  <pre><code>"Set-AdUser -Identity User.Name -LogOnWorkstations $null" </code></pre>  <p>Here is what I thought would work - But ends up not being the case:</p>  <pre><code>$csv = Import-Csv C:\Users\administrator\Desktop\users.csv Set-AdUser -Identity $csv -LogOnWorkstations $null </code></pre>  <p>If anyone has an idea why my second script isn't working, that would be greatly appreciated!</p>
