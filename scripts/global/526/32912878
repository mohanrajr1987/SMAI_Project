<p>I am trying to execute the Powershell command:</p>  <p><code>Stop-BrokerSession 2904</code></p>  <p>That number, 2904, definitely shows up in the results as seen in the code below. I used MessageBox.Show to verify the right number for the session id. However, for some reason I get this binding error. I can type that command in at the powershell prompt and it works fine, but when trying to execute it here I get this binding exception. What's the deal?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/PSLci.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/PSLci.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>My guess as to what is wrong is that this parameter doesn't have a name. It's just a number. You put the command and the session id next to it but there isn't a name for it, it's not like "Stop-BrokerSession -SessionId 2904" it's just "Stop-BrokerSession 2904" and that I think is the issue.</p>  <p>Also this doesn't work:</p>  <pre><code>logoff.parameters.Add(null, x.Properties["Uid"].Value.ToString()); </code></pre>
