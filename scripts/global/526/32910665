<p>Trying to figure out SSO. </p>  <p>We installed ADFS on our Windows Server 2012 then I  created an Azure Active Directory version of an SSO sample project following: <a href="https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-native-client" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-native-client</a></p>  <p><strong>That worked fine.</strong></p>  <p>Then trying to port it to our Windows Server 2012 ADFS I followed this tutorial:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.cloudidentity.com/blog/2013/10/25/securing-a-web-api-with-adfs-on-ws2012-r2-got-even-easier/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cloudidentity.com/blog/2013/10/25/securing-a-web-api-with-adfs-on-ws2012-r2-got-even-easier/</a></p>  <p>Which at one point says to run the following powershell command to add the WPF windows client to ADFS:</p>  <pre><code>Add-ADFSClient -Name “MyClient” -ClientId “E1CF1107-FF90-4228-93BF-26052DD2C714” -RedirectUri “http://anarbitraryreturnuri/” </code></pre>  <p>But this tutorial is geared towards Windows Server 2012 <strong>R2</strong> and we run the plain Windows Server 2012 version and this Add-ADFSClient powershell command is missing.</p>  <p>How can I do the equivalent adding of a Windows client to ADFS on Windows Server 2012?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
