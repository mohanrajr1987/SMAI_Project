<p>I have recently set up Microsoft Azure Backup to protect Windows Servers under recovery services.  I know that you can setup retention schedules and back up schedules via the local GUI and powershell but <strong>does anyone know of a way to have Azure send email notifications of successful and/or failed backups through this service.</strong> All of the servers are local and not Azure VMs.</p>
