<p>I'm looking for a command in Powershell that can configure additional settings for Web Server Logging:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/NjxpmZi.png" alt="azure diagnostics"></p>  <p>So far I can turn on diagnostics with the command:</p>  <pre><code>Set-AzureWebsite HttpLoggingEnabled 1 </code></pre>  <p>Are there commands to enable and set retention as well as the quota?</p>
