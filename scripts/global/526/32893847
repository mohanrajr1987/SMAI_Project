<p>I have a GUI file which is currently being ran by VBS, but i have a few issues:</p>  <p>Powershell v2 is what is being run on every machine and i cant change that, runs very slow on first time launch. it takes about 10secs then my .ps1 will run, which can take another 10secs depending on the speed, but on second run it loads promptly, but this program shouldn't be run twice..</p>  <p>Is there anything i can consider adding to avoid doing what it does at the beginning? </p>  <p>My other issue which is a related to the first part, i have just started to program and was hoping someone can have a look at my code to remove unnecessary code that can slow the program from loading.</p>  <p>I have a few important information on it so i would need to remove most stuff, like server details, which wont make it run. Is this something i can do here? If it is, i will post the code tomorrow morning.</p>
