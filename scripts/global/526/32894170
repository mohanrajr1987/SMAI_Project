<p>I am trying to write a PowerShell script to do the following.</p>  <ol> <li><p>Rename files in source (FTP folders) directories with it's "current_name_datetime.csv" as per a source file "Source_list.csv" this file has the directories "source,destination" I want this script to look into.</p></li> <li><p>Copy newly renamed files to backup directories as per destination in Source_list.csv this file has the directories "source,destination" I want this script to look into.</p></li> <li><p>Move newly renamed files to final destination directory which is not in my current script.</p></li> </ol>  <p>Source_list.csv contents</p>  <p>cscenter,Costume_Supercenter</p>  <p>fkimports,FKImports</p>  <p>My Script:</p>  <pre class="lang-psh prettyprint-override"><code>$sdfiles = Get-Content c:\!tony\Source_list.csv $sourceDir = "c:\test\" $destinationDir = "c:\testing\"  Get-ChildItem $sourceDir -Recurse -Include $sdfiles "*.csv"| ForEach-Object{        $newname= "{0}{1}_{2}.csv" -f $destinationDir, $_.BaseName,     [datetime]::Now.ToString('MM-dd-yyyy-hh-mm-ss')     $_|Copy-Item -Include ,$sdfiles -Destination $newname -whatif } </code></pre>  <p>Error:</p>  <pre><code>What if: Performing operation "Copy Directory" on Target "Item: C:\test\cscenter Destination: C:\testing\cscenter_10-01-2015-12-22-24.csv". </code></pre>  <p>I see in the error that it is trying to copy the directory not the single file in each directory and creating a new folder using the original folder name and renaming the folder and appending the date/time stamp.</p>
