<p>I have found many examples that read a SQL database, as using PowerShell on the net.</p>  <p>But, I can not find any example, to read an unknown database with ODBC and powershell. (The database handles SQL queries via ODBC) I know the name of the ODBC connector (DSN = Squid Star) The database has no username and password (ie the database is open) Also knows the names of the various tables, that I would want to read. I want the ability to specify which fields to export with SQL queries (such as SELECT * FROM OPERATOR)</p>  <p>The result should be saved in a CSV file in UTF-8 format and preferably with headers.</p>  <hr>  <p>Is it difficult to make an import, with certain fields to the same database via ODBC using PowerShell?</p>  <p>I have no idea how to fix this, but I think that it should not be so difficult with PowerShell</p>  <p>//Jan</p>
