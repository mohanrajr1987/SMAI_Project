<p>I am executing a Powershell script to read the recursive contents of a parent directory and move files that match a pattern.</p>  <p>File are being written to the children directories by a separate tool that keeps them as ".filename" until the write is complete and then renames them to "filename" (without the leading dot).</p>  <p>The Powershell directory list command 'Get-ChildItem' appears to be locking files as they are being written, causing the tool to abandon the file write and resulting in many zero byte ".filename" files (the tool does not have a retry capability).</p>  <p>I say "appears" because when the Powershell script is running, the empty dot files show up. No script, no empty dot files. </p>  <p>The Get-ChildItem command is the only command in the script that touches these files. I know this command shouldn't be locking the files for write, but I can't find other possible causes. I am excluding .* when executing Get-ChildItem but I don't know what else to try.</p>  <p>Has anyone come across this issue before? Is there a command besides 'Get-ChildItem' I should be using?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
