<p>I have a tab delimited file that has 10k+ rows. I need to change a specific field of the first(header) record to a specific value..  I am using the following script, but it messes up the format.</p>  <pre><code>$contents = Get-Content $PATH -Delimiter "`t" $contents[1] = 'Replaced Text' $contents | Out-File $PATH </code></pre>  <p>I can see that the format will mess up, but i am not sure how to keep the file exactly as it is and just change what I need to. Also, I would like to know if there is an efficient way.. Because i am just concerned with the first line of the file.</p>  <p>I tried a different approach, it works "ok" but introduces extra blank lines after each line: </p>  <pre><code>$content = Get-Content $PATH -Delimiter "`n" $content |    ForEach-Object {      if ($_.ReadCount -le 1) {        $_ -replace 'A','B'      } else {        $_      }    } |    Set-Content $PATH </code></pre>
