<p>I'm making a simple powershell script to replace SubWCRev in our environment. So I have a lot of template files containing variables like <code>$WCREV$</code> and so forth. </p>  <p>I'm can't do a simple find and replace on those variables though.. I'm unable to escape the $-character properly. </p>  <p>The find-and-replace is simple;</p>  <pre><code>function FindAndReplace { param(     [string]$inputFile,      [string]$outputFile,     [string]$findString,      [string]$replaceString)     (Get-Content $inputFile) | foreach {$_ -replace $findString, $replaceString} |     Set-Content $outputFile } </code></pre>  <p>And I've tried many alternatives for the $findString..</p>  <p>Tried;</p>  <pre><code>$findString = '$WCREV$' $findString = '`$WCREV`$' $findString = "`$WCREV`$" $findString = "$WCREV$"  </code></pre>  <p>Can't make any of it work. If I try just WCREV it replaces it alright, but then I'm left with the $ of course.. I guess I could modify my templates but it seems like a silly little problem so it's probably doable, right? </p>
