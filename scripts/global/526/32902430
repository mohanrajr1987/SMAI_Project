<p>I'm working on a small C# program to uninstall and reinstall windows appxpackages. I've used many of the powershell commands manually and they all work fine if ran via powershell however I would like to just make a button that runs the command without having to go look up the command then copy paste it into the prompt window. I've researched this method for a few days now and I've not found anything helpful.  Everywhere I look other users have done something like this however while this will compile this will not do anything. Perhaps I am just not seeing something or perhaps not understanding something. Can anyone please help!</p>  <pre><code>Powershell commands: Get-AppxPackage *windowsstore* | Remove-AppxPackage Get-AppxPackage *windowsstore* | Add-AppxPackage </code></pre>  <p>.</p>  <pre><code>using System.Management.Automation; </code></pre>  <p>.</p>  <pre><code>private void button_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) {     PowerShell ps = PowerShell.Create();     ps.AddCommand("Get-AppxPackage");     ps.AddArgument("*windowsstore*");     ps.AddCommand("Remove-AppxPackage");     ps.Invoke();     Console.WriteLine("POWERSHELL OUTPUT! =( "+ps+" )"); } </code></pre>  <p>Output:<br>     POWERSHELL OUTPUT! =( System.Management.Automation.PowerShell )</p>
