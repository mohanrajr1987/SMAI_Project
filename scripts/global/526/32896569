<p>This is my first question on the site and I hope I am able to find some assistance. My knowledge with PowerShell is limited but I am trying my hardest to learn as much as I can.</p>  <p>I am packaging up an application for SAP GUI 7.4 not utilizing the Netweaver client and still utilizing the GUI Logon. I have already created a way to add the needed .ini and .xml files in the Default profile so new accounts logging into the machine will generate the needed files in their respective \appdata\roaming... file locations. The problem I am having is that at the point of install I need to copy the files for all profiles that exist on the machine already. </p>  <p>I am trying to use the following to find all profiles on the machine:</p>  <pre><code>[string[]]$ProfilePaths = Get-UserProfiles | Select-Object -ExpandProperty 'ProfilePath'| </code></pre>  <p>And then create the following folders and copy files into the folder location: Folder: c:\users[profile]\appdata\roaming\sap\common\ File:  saplogon.ini</p>  <p>I am using PSAppDeployToolkit so the syntax may be a bit off. This is what I have right now:</p>  <pre><code>$ProfilePaths = Get-UserProfiles | Select-Object -ExpandProperty 'ProfilePath'     ForEach-Object {      New-Folder -Path "$ProfilePaths\AppData\Roaming\SAP"     New-Folder -Path "$ProfilePaths\AppData\Roaming\SAP\Common"     Copy-File -Path "$dirFiles\Support\saplogon.ini" -Destination "$ProfilePaths\AppData\Roaming\SAP\Common\saplogon.ini"     Copy-File -Path "$dirFiles\Support\SapLogonTree.xml" -Destination "$ProfilePaths\AppData\Roaming\SAP\Common\SapLogonTree.xml"     Copy-File -Path "$dirFiles\Support\SAPUILandscape.xml" -Destination "$ProfilePaths\AppData\Roaming\SAP\Common\SAPUILandscape.xml"     Copy-File -Path "$dirFiles\Support\SAPUILandscapeGlobal.xml" -Destination "$ProfilePaths\AppData\Roaming\SAP\Common\SAPUILandscapeGlobal.xml"     }     Copy-File -Path "$dirFiles\Support\SAP Logon.lnk" -Destination "C:\Users\Public\Desktop\SAP Logon.lnk"     Remove-File -Path 'C:\Users\Public\Desktop\NetWeaver Business Client 5.0.lnk' </code></pre>  <p>Any and all help would be greatly appreciated.</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
