<p>I am developing an android game which seems to work absolutely fine on my two test devices (Galaxy S3 and original Nexus 7). When the app run it looks like this:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/oLuhO.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/oLuhO.png" alt="working screen shot"></a></p>  <p>However whenever i send the apk to friends to try run it, the game doesnt render properly and ends up lookin like this: </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/cR75m.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/cR75m.jpg" alt="broken screenshot"></a></p>  <p>or worse, they only draw the orange and blue arrows and the clear colour.</p>  <p>The orange and blue arrows are part of my ui which use an orthographic camera but have primarily the same setting. The shader is different however but the second image shows that textures are being passed to the GPU at least semi effectively and the objects are in the right places. </p>  <p>This is a bug i would be able to debug usually but i dont have access to the devices that dont work. So my question is: Has anyone run into uch issue before or have any idea what might be going wrong? </p>  <p>Im using Java and openGL ES 2.0. the galaxy and nexus are running android 4.3 and 4.2.2 respectively. the test devices which dont work are all newer. </p>
