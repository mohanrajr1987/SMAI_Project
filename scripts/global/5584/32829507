<p>How can I simulate photoshop's color blend mode without conversion RGB to HSL and back? I'm using GLSL. In my fragment shader there are two texture units, one for the background image and another for the foreground image. Each image is in RGB color space, of course. As I understand correctly, I should to convert each image in HSL and take luminance from the background but hue and saturation from the foreground. In this case I need to convert each image to HSL, do necessary calculations and convert result back to RGB. Is there alternative way? </p>
