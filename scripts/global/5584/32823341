<p>I wrote a video play view, it is a SurfaceView with a MediaPlayer instance. I attached the mediaplayer to the surface holder when surface created then start the play. </p>  <p>This is easy and everyone knows the details. But I want to draw a bitmap which is the first frame of the video to the surfaceview.Canvas is not a choice to draw the bitmap, because it will disable the mediaplayer to connect.</p>  <p>Since api level 14, we can new a surface with surfacetexture. So we can use opengl es to draw video frame and bitmap.  But I am concerned about the performance.This way of playing video is more complicated and will it cause more overhead? Who can give me some advices?</p>
