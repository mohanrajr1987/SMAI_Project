<p>I’m a C++ application developer on Windows system. I’m developing an application using EGL 1.4 and OpenGL ES 2.0.</p>  <p>In a certain kind of a OpenGL32.DLL version, I found that a PVR error message occurred. The versions of OpenGL32.DLL that cause this problem are 6.3.9600.16384 on Win8.1 and 4.0.1379.1. And the message says :</p>  <p>PVR Message</p>  <p>PVR: VFrame attempted to use one of these functions: PVR: wglChoosePixelFormatARB PVR: but they are not present on you machine.</p>  <p>Ignore?</p>  <p>This message appeared when I call eglChooseConfig() or eglGetConfigs() functions in EGL API to get system configs.</p>  <p>I think this problem occurred because OpenGL32.dll versions mentioned above don’t support wglChoosePixelFormatARB() function.</p>  <p>Most of versions that I tested worked well. List of working version is : 5.2.3790.3959 6.1.7600.16385 6.3.9600.16384(1000kb) 10.0.10130.0</p>  <p>And list of not working version is : 4.0.1379.1 5.1.2600.1280 5.1.2600.5512 6.3.9600.16384 (720kb)</p>  <p>To solve this problem, I want to include this dll file in my product for a commercial use. I want to know that distributing a working version of OpenGL32.dll is possible. And can you know me the list of OpenGL32.dll version without this error and license information about OpenGL32.dll?</p>  <p>Thank you and I will be waiting for your reply.</p>
