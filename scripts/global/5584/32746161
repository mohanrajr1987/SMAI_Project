<p>I am having this error when the app is trying to get data from internet:</p>  <p><strong>E/chromium(5891): [ERROR:buffer_manager.cc(313)] [.Parent-Compositor-0xaeeced60]GL ERROR :GL_INVALID_OPERATION : glBufferData: &lt;- error from previous GL command</strong></p>  <p>The app is using cordova and android. This problem only occurs with Android 5.1 and I don't know why is this happening because the app works with all other devices.</p>
