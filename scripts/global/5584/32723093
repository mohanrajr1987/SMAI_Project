<p>I noticed I could not change the size of points in the vertex shader with gl_PointSize in my OpenGL ES 3.0  android application. Eventually I found out that I had to enable GL_PROGRAM_POINT_SIZE even though this enum value isn't defined in the gl header file. So I ended up adding glEnable(0x8642);</p>  <p>Everything works fine now, but is this a bug? Or is there a reason that I need to enable this. I know I need to do this on a compatibility context in Windows, but I thought on Android I would be working with a pure ES 3.0 context. Maybe my GL context wasn't set up correctly?</p>
