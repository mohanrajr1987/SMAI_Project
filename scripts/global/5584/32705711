<p>I am extremely new to <code>openGL ES</code> and the tutorials that I found online don't really make any sense to me. I am trying to just draw a simple 2D rectangle on the screen in <code>IOS Objective C</code> but I can't figure out how to do it. I found this on some tutorial but it doesn't do anything:</p>  <pre><code>- (void)glkView:(GLKView *)view drawInRect:(CGRect)rect { GLfloat square[] = {     0.25, 0.25, 0.0,     0.75, 0.25, 0.0,     0.25, 0.75, 0.0,     0.75, 0.75, 0.0 }; glClearColor(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);  glMatrixMode(GL_PROJECTION); glLoadIdentity(); glVertexPointer(3, GL_FLOAT, 0, square); glEnableClientState(GL_VERTEX_ARRAY); glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT); glDrawArrays(GL_TRIANGLES, 0, 4); glFlush();   glOrthof(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f, -1.0f, 1.0f);   glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);} </code></pre>  <p>anything that will effectively draw a <code>square/rectangle</code> with some explanation will be very much appreciated. Thanks!</p>
