<p>i want to render a terrain and i have found for this a lot of nice tutorials like this one: <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/14154/OpenGL-Terrain-Generation-An-Introduction" rel="nofollow">http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/14154/OpenGL-Terrain-Generation-An-Introduction</a>. The most tutorials explain rendering with the triangle strip technique.</p>  <p>I have advised doin'g this with a seperate shader program and instancing. My consideration is the following:</p>  <ul> <li>i am reading the shader code for the terrain vertex and fragment shader from the files terrain.vs and terrain.fs. </li> <li>in my OpenGL program i have only created 6 vertices for a quad (every col of the terrain) and no indices. In addition i am texturing only on the one quad.</li> <li>when i want to draw the terrain in the draw method, i only have to switch to the terrain shader program and use glDrawArraysInstanced function so i can draw only 6 vertices and instanciate the rest of them.</li> </ul>  <p>With this consideration i am drawing real only one quad with a texture and instancing it how much i want to. </p>  <p>Does this consideration work?</p>
