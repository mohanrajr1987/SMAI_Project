<p>I am developing a 3D game for <strong>iPhone</strong> and <strong>iPad</strong> without using any game engine. I found that on <strong>iPhone</strong> <strong>4</strong>, certain frames are skipped which causes game to stutter. The game is normally running at <strong>60</strong> FPS, but when this issue happens the FPS drops to <strong>55</strong>.</p>  <p>During debugging I understood that the code is taking more time to execute <strong>OpenGL</strong> code when the above issue occurs. Normally <strong>OpenGL</strong> code takes <strong>3 milliseconds</strong> to execute but the execution time increases to <strong>17 milliseconds</strong> when this issue occurs. I am facing this issue only on the <strong>iPhone 4 running iOS 7</strong>.</p>  <p>I have three questions:</p>  <ol> <li><p>Why the execution time increases even if I am rendering the same 3D geometry?</p></li> <li><p>How can I optimise the 3D rendering code to have constant rendering time of 3 milliseconds (approximately)?</p></li> <li><p>Are there any other code modules which can cause such issues?</p></li> </ol>  <p>Any suggestions on this issue?</p>
