<p>I am continuing work that I referenced <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31527134/controlling-frame-rate-of-virtualdisplay">here</a> and have hit a few snags. I have a <code>VirtualDisplay</code> that has a <code>Surface</code> that the frames are written to and then I use that same surface as input for a <code>MediaCodec</code> so that the frames from the <code>VirtualDisplay</code> are encoded. This is all occurring in some <code>Threads</code> that are running in an Android <code>Service</code> <strong>NOT</strong> in an <code>Activity</code>.</p>  <p>I now want to add an intermediary <code>Surface</code> into the chain so that the progress will go <code>VirtualDisplay</code> -> write to <code>SurfaceA</code> -> some logic/features -> write to <code>SurfaceB</code> -> encode <code>SurfaceB</code></p>  <p>I have created, after much struggle, <code>SurfaceA</code> using just straight OpenGL and EGL calls, not using <code>GLSurfaceView.</code> I'm using <a href="https://github.com/google/grafika/blob/master/src/com/android/grafika/RecordFBOActivity.java" rel="nofollow">this</a> as an example of how I should be writing from <code>SurfaceA</code> to <code>SurfaceB</code>. From my understanding I just need two <code>EGLSurfaces</code> in a single <code>EGLContext</code>.</p>  <p>From my understanding, the GL context can be lost at any time and I may need to recreate my OpenGL texture (and maybe EGLSurfaces too?). This is usually handled via <code>GLSurfaceView</code> but since I am not using one, is there an easy way to know when the context is lost? Should I just use a <code>GLSurfaceView</code> even though none of my work involves a <code>View</code> or is visible to the user? How do you call <code>onPause</code> and <code>onResume</code> for a <code>GLSurfaceView</code> if there is no <code>Activity</code>?</p>  <p>Thanks for the help.</p>
