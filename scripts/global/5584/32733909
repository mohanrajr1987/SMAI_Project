<p>iOS 9 has a few new keys such as <code>kCVPixelBufferOpenGLESTextureCacheCompatibilityKey</code> and <code>kCVPixelBufferOpenGLESCompatibilityKey</code></p>  <p>To comply with some requirements, I needed to create a custom pixelformat, similar to yuv420 planar.</p>  <p>And I want to use <code>CVOpenGLTextureCacheCreateTextureFromImage</code> function. I call it for a single plane, so using GL_LUMINANCE as the GL type as it is planar</p>  <p>If the 2 new keys mentioned above are used <code>CVOpenGLTextureCacheCreateTextureFromImage</code> does not generate an error but the final output is blank. </p>  <p>If I just replace this custom format with '420f' (the standard biplanar format that we get from Apple), and call the function for the luminance plane, it works. So, the code itself doesn't have an issue.</p>  <p>My question is what does the key <code>kCVPixelBufferOpenGLESTextureCacheCompatibilityKey</code> do? And what can I look into to make my custom format compatible with the <code>CVOpenGLTextureCacheCreateTextureFromImage</code> function?</p>
