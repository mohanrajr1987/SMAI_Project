<p>I'm developing a game (with libGDX, for Windows, Linux and Android, based on OpenGL 2). I know that there are some technical restrictions/requirements when it comes to texture sizes in OpenGL. But I've heard conflicting statements about these so I need some clarification:</p>  <ul> <li>Maximum texture size: I guess it's device dependent and somewhat about 2048x2048 should be save on halfway modern devices. Correct? Does this apply to the texture atlas or the whole texture object?</li> <li>Power-of-two: OpenGL 2 supports textures with a edge length that is not a power of two. But I've heard that it might be safer to use such old-fashinod sized textures. Correct?</li> <li>Bitmap size: Does the size of the bitmap (e.g. <code>player_sprite.png</code>) that is loaded into the game have anything to do with this maximum texture size or this power-of-two thing?</li> </ul>
