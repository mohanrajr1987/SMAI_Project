<p>So, I'm making a live wallpaper in android using OpenGL ES 2.0 using a series of squares with image textures in a 3D environment. The problem that I'm running into is that I'm getting a weird black line that flickers upon camera movement. The squares are supposed to be transparent, and I can't figure out what's causing this or how to fix it. I've tried using Anti Aliasing, and I've set the transparency using both          GLES20.glBlendFunc(GLES20.GL_ONE, GLES20.GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA); and</p>  <pre><code>    GLES20.glBlendFunc(GLES20.GL_SRC_ALPHA, GLES20.GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA); </code></pre>  <p>This is what my wallpaper looks like right now. Three layers (background, girl, grass), with both the grass and girl showing a dark line around the top edge.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/IiPEc.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/IiPEc.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Anyone know what I'm doing wrong, or how to fix this?</p>
