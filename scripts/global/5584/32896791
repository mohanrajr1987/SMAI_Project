<p>I'd like help with grabbing frames from an online video stream on the iOS platform.</p>  <p>The video stream comes from an URL, and should be applied to a specific geometry as a texture. Unfortunately AVPlayer doesn't seem to support this.</p>  <p>Any kind of open-source library or solution in Objective C or C,C++ would do it, if you could recommend. Even a library that could read the video from the URL and had a function that returned the actual W*H pixel data would be of enormous help. In that case the pixels could be uploaded using double PBOs and glTexSubImage2D even if that's not the fastest.</p>
