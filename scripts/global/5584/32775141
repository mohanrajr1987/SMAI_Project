<p>Is possible to make an android app having action bar, list view and other Native android stuff but for showing animations instead of using OpenGL can we use Unity-3D? If it is not possible please recommend me some tutorials to learn OpenGl or some library which makes it easier to animate things like, Two circle's being connected by a line such that line starts from circle 1 and ends on circle 2 ?</p>
