<p>I have a universal landscape app built from Apple's old OpenGLES example, and when I build in XCode 6 or 7 the view is sideways:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Da8ra.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Da8ra.png" alt="sideways"></a></p>  <p>Apple has broken my rotation before, and previous times I fixed it just by using transforms to rotate and scale my view, which worked fine.</p>  <p>With XCode 6/7, if I rotate the layer using CGAffineTransformMakeRotation() then the rotation is correct but it retains the original aspect ratio:  </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/6kRJW.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/6kRJW.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>That should be easy to fix with scaling, but I weirdly cannot scale it to fit the screen.  I can match the width or height:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZOFJp.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZOFJp.png" alt="matched width"></a></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/h2Ffi.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/h2Ffi.png" alt="matched height"></a></p>  <p>But no matter what values I use for height/width scaling, it's not possible to scale both height and width to the screen.  This is what I get when I set (what should be) the correct scaling values:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/appEL.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/appEL.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I've experimented a bunch with the scaling, and for some reason the width and height do not appear to be fully independent of each other.  Autolayout is off and I can't find anywhere that constraints are set.  I've also tried settings the view bounds and frame, but it has exactly the same weird scaling limitations that I get when I use a transform.</p>  <p>If I rotate the pixel dimensions of the OpenGL buffer, then it appears at the correct size, but the right side is cut off.  I never could find any way to fix this either:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/emm4o.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/emm4o.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>The only thing that makes the view fit correctly is changing the app's plist orientations from Landscape Left/Right to standard Portrait only.  But this creates orientation problems when interacting with other music apps since my software is not actually operating in portrait -- the orientation sometimes flips when switching apps, and half the time my app starts upside down.</p>
