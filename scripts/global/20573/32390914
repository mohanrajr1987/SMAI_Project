<p>Can anyone help me with this? I am developing an app via Titanium/ Appcelerator. However whenever I try and run the app via device or emulator using SDK 3.1.3. I receive a node_module error. I have uninstalled and reinstalled node, as well as the SDK with no luck. The exact error is below.</p>  <p>titanium/node_modules/longjohn/dist/longjohn.js:194 throw e; typeERROR cannot read property 'options' of undefined</p>
