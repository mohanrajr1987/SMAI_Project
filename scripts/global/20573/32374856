<p>First question ever so bare with me. I'm developing an app for both iOS and Android. We're using AWS SNS for Push Notifications. iOS runs fine BUT for Android I receive a push event but the payload is empty no matter what we try in SNS. (Have tried to push via Arrow and it works fine, so it feels like a problem in SNS)</p>  <p>Is there anybody out there who have done the same and got it to work?</p>
