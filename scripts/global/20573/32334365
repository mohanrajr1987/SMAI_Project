<p>I have an invisible view that is used as an area for a swipe (an area to open the menu swiping to the right). Problem is this view stops any click that would occur in elements that appear below it. Any ideas on how to make this click/touch event go through without the complete removal of the swipe on my swipe area view? If I use the <code>touchEnabled</code> option it removes all the events.</p>
