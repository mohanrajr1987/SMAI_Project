<p>I have PDF , to view that pdf i have used document viewer</p>  <p><code>var viewer = Ti.UI.iOS.createDocumentViewer({     url:"Barcode.pdf",     height:'100%',     bottom:0 }); viewer.show();</code></p>  <p>The pdf will be displayed as center, top as title bar, but bottom as empty, I am unable to set the height as 100%. I have also used <code>Ti.UI.FILL</code> but still no use. Can any one please share the ideas.</p>  <p>Thanks in Advance,</p>  <p>Swathi.</p>
