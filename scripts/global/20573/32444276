<p>I need to make an authoring app for being mainly used in iPad, and in second place on web browsers. I have been considering using Titanium for this task, with the purpose to build once and deploy and fine tuning 2 versiones (iOS and html5), but I can't find much information about how effective is to build a web app using Titanium, and our tests so far has not being specially promising. Any experiences/advice?</p>
