<p>We have just released an updated version of our app on itunes. Everything works fine when users who currently do not have the app on their device download it. However it freezes at the splash screen if users try to do an update.</p>  <p>I am guessing this might be some cache related issue since the newer version is indeed totally different and also smaller in size. Could this really be the case or might it be due to something else? </p>  <p>We would really like to avoid publishing a new build to itunes but having current users not being able to update the app is also not very efficient. </p>
