<p>When attempting to build my Ti app, run it in the simulator, or run it on my device, suddenly I get this error during compile:</p>  <pre><code>[ERROR] :  (404) The request is not recognized! TRACE  | titanium exited with exit code 100 ERROR  | Error: ti run exited with error code 100     at ChildProcess.&lt;anonymous&gt; (/Users/natej/.appcelerator/install/4.1.2/package/node_modules/appc-cli-titanium/plugins/run.js:84:66)     at ChildProcess.emit (events.js:117:20)     at Process.ChildProcess._handle.onexit (child_process.js:810:12) </code></pre>  <p>I am running latest Appcelerator Studio and building with Ti SDK 4.1.0 GA. I have tried to Clean my project, but that didn't help. Normally when there's a bug in my code I get a helpful error message and it indicates the offending line number. But this tells me nothing and I have no idea what to do about it.</p>  <p>I did find this bug report: <a href="https://jira.appcelerator.org/browse/CLI-764" rel="nofollow">https://jira.appcelerator.org/browse/CLI-764</a></p>  <p>Anything I can do?</p>
