<p>XCode decided to do an upgrade to iOS 9, and after that the app refuses to deploy to the emulator. The build works ok, but it fails at this:</p>  <pre><code>[INFO] :   Invoking xcodebuild [INFO] :   Finished building the application in 40s 523ms [INFO] :   Launching iOS Simulator [ERROR] :  Project failed to build after 1m 21s 108ms [ERROR] :  An error occurred running the iOS Simulator (ios-sim exit code 1) TRACE  | titanium exited with exit code 1 ERROR  | Error: ti run exited with error code 1     at ChildProcess.&lt;anonymous&gt; (/Users/stop/.appcelerator/install/5.0.1/package/node_modules/appc-cli-titanium/plugins/run.js:89:66)     at ChildProcess.emit (events.js:117:20)     at Process.ChildProcess._handle.onexit (child_process.js:810:12) </code></pre>  <p>Any ideas? There's no updates that i can install, it says everything is up to date.</p>  <p>I have SDK 5.1.0. installed</p>
