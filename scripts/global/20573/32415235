<p>Just a few days ago I could both run (in the simulator and on my iphone device) and package my iOS app for the iOS iTunes Store. But now I cannot get past this error during package:</p>  <pre><code>[ERROR] :  ** BUILD FAILED ** [ERROR] :  The following build commands failed: [ERROR] :   Validate build/Release-iphoneos/Trivia\ Rain.app [ERROR] :  (1 failure) TRACE  | titanium exited with exit code 1 ERROR  | Error: ti run exited with error code 1     at ChildProcess.&lt;anonymous&gt; (/Users/natej/.appcelerator/install/4.1.2/package/node_modules/appc-cli-titanium/plugins/run.js:84:66)     at ChildProcess.emit (events.js:117:20)     at Process.ChildProcess._handle.onexit (child_process.js:810:12) </code></pre>  <p>Since a few days ago when the package worked perfectly, I have changed nothing related to my keychains, keystore, profiles, certificates, etc. I have made a few code changes, but after my changes, the app compiled fine, runs in simulator, and deploys/runs on my iphone 6 device. I have double checked that my certs and distribution profiles are all valid, and nothing has changed from a few days ago.</p>  <p>I have cleaned my project, restarted Appcelerator Studio, restarted my mac. Still I cannot get past this error.</p>  <p>Any ideas?</p>
