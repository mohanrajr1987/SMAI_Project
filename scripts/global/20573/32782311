<p>The situation is as follows: i want to make pre-build step plugin for titanium project, that would parse and format i18n files, so i wouldn't have to do it myself. Tasks are simple, like stripping double quotes from begining and end or replacing placeholders in text.</p>  <p>I had read <a href="https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides2/Titanium+CLI+Plugins" rel="nofollow">documentation</a> on build plugins, but still, i dont know how to access those xml's.</p>
