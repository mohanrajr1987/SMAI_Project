<p>I am using Titanium SDK 4.1.0.GA and originally used version 1.2 of the Ti.Paint module for iOS. This version does not work properly on iOS 8 in the sense that the line drawn stutters.</p>  <p>I then upgraded the Ti.Paint module to 1.4 (currently the latest release). The line drawing on the canvas now works perfectly, but for some reason there are no event Listeners for the Ti.Paint Object, where there were in previous versions of the module.</p>  <p>How does one now check if someone is actually drawing on the canvas? A good example of this is if you want use to Ti.Paint to have users provide their signature and you want to validate that interaction on the Canvas occurred.</p>
