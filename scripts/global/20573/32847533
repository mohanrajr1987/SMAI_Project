<p>I want want to use Speechkit SDK in my app, since I found it recognize words better than the native tool did. I found a Titanium module <a href="https://github.com/benbahrenburg/Ti.SpeechKit" rel="nofollow">on GitHub</a> but it is designed to work with Titanium SDK 3.1.3.GA . I am currently working with SDK 5.0.0.GA.</p>  <p>What am I supposed to do to import this module in my mobile app ? I updated the titanium.xcconfig file to reflect the version of my SDK. I also put my credentials into it and build the project. Then I compressed it and installed it via Help Menu > Install Mobile Module. I finally added it to the tiapp.xml file.</p>  <p>When I try to run the project, this is what I get :</p>  <pre><code>[ERROR] :  ** BUILD FAILED ** [ERROR] :  The following build commands failed: [ERROR] :   Ld Build/Intermediates/Hello5.build/Debug-iphoneos/Hello5.build/Objects-normal/arm64/Hello5 normal arm64 [ERROR] :   Ld Build/Intermediates/Hello5.build/Debug-iphoneos/Hello5.build/Objects-normal/armv7/Hello5 normal armv7 [ERROR] :  (2 failures) TRACE  | titanium exited with exit code 1 ERROR  | Error: ti run exited with error code 1     at ChildProcess.&lt;anonymous&gt; (/Users/feeder/.appcelerator/install/5.0.1/package/node_modules/appc-cli-titanium/plugins/run.js:89:66)     at ChildProcess.emit (events.js:117:20)     at Process.ChildProcess._handle.onexit (child_process.js:820:12) </code></pre>  <p>I tried to create a new module by hand and drag-and-drop files into it, and also tried to install globally vs project-specific, I can't come with an idea for making it work. Thank you in advance if you could share an idea ;)</p>
