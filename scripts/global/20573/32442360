<p>I'm running this command <code>titanium build -p ios -T simulator --shadow</code> in my Appcelerator Studio project dir and as a result the iOS simulator launches and my app is up and running.</p>  <p>The thing though, is that I have a SQLite db which I wish to debug.  As a result, I want ALL my app data to be deleted whenever I relaunch the app. (that is on every file save)</p>  <p>How can I do that?</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
