<p>I have an application that was originally built in titanium and I have now re-built the app in native android code. The problem is that when I try to install my new native app over the top of the titanium app I get this error:</p>  <p>Failure [INSTALL_FAILED_CONFLICTING_PROVIDER]</p>  <p>it then asks me if I want to uninstall the old application - I say "yes" and then I get this error:</p>  <p>DELETE_FAILED_INTERNAL_ERROR</p>  <p>Obviously if I change the applicationID I can avoid this issue, but since the titanium app is already in the play store, I want to be able to upload my new APK as an update, rather then building a whole new app for my users to download.</p>  <p>Any ideas how I can get around this issue?</p>
