<p>Is there any possible way to center align the action item icons that are shown in action bar of titanium app for android. I have searched a lot of places for this solution but had no luck. I want the action bar to look like the below image. Also tell me the way to not show app title in the action bar.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/2fyh7.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/2fyh7.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
