<p>Hi I have some Problems using CSP. Maybe someone has any idea how to solve this.</p>  <p>I had CSP Header with some hashes. The hashes I took from chome console.  So everything on Chrome is accepted by CSP Header. </p>  <p>If I start the page in fixrefox, I get some CSP Error for that I put the hashes in the Header.</p>  <p>Had someone this, that in Chrome everything works fine with CSP but on Firefox not?</p>  <p>Can you give me some ideas how to solve this Problems? Is Firefox able to handle the sha256 hashes?</p>
