<p>I'm struggling to find an answer to my question, perhaps I'm not explaining it very well.</p>  <p>I have a fixed header with a navigation in it, here's the HTML;</p>  <pre><code>&lt;header&gt; &lt;nav&gt;     &lt;ul&gt;         &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="home.html"&gt;HOME&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;         &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="about.html"&gt;ABOUT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;         &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="ourpassion.html"&gt;OUR PASSION&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;         &lt;li&gt;&lt;a HREF="whatwedo.html"&gt;WHAT WE DO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;         &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="blog.html"&gt;BLOG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;         &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="contact.html"&gt;CONTACT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/nav&gt; </code></pre>  <p></p>  <p>When i scroll down in the body (to see more content) the links themselves scroll out of the viewport whilst the header and its contents remain. In other words, the header visuals (like the link text e.g. HOME, ABOUT, CONTACTS etc.) remain and give the impression of links, but I can no longer hover over them as the  tags seem to have disappeared upwards.</p>  <p>I don't understand how to resolve this issue. Amateur programmer here. Attached below is the whole html file for reference.</p>  <p>Much obliged!
