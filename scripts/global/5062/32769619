<p>I'm looking for a header file that defines <em>struct vnode</em> from Mac OS X 10.10. I googled a bit and could find the following link that states <em>bsd/sys/vnode_internal.h</em> contains the definition.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/xnu-2782.40.9/bsd/sys/vnode_internal.h" rel="nofollow">http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/xnu-2782.40.9/bsd/sys/vnode_internal.h</a></p>  <p>However I can't find the file from my OS X typically under <em>/usr/include</em>. Can you help finding the definition?</p>
