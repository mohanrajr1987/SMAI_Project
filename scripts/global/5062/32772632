<p>The question  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/583255/c-code-in-header-files">C++ code in header files</a> was asked and answered 6 years ago, and the answers say that there are some reasons to put code in header files. Since then, compilers have gotten more sophisticated and optimized; is there any reason to put code in headers today? </p>  <p>I had discussions about this with a colleague today and wanted to know the real answer. Mine is there is no reason and that it is bad practice. </p>
