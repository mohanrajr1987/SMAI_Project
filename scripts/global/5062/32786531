<p>I've been going around in circles trying to serve a PDF securely using variations of fopen() and readfile(). Most methods work fine in Firefox and Chrome whether I'm on Windows/OSX/iOS but <strong>no</strong> method will work with Internet Explorer or Safari. I've tried all sorts of header variations based on what others have suggested but no luck.</p>  <p>Here is my code:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php session_start(); if ($_SESSION['user_is_logged_in'] === true || $_SESSION['admin_user_is_logged_in'] === true) {      $name = $_GET['name'];     $path = "www.mypath.com/$name";     $fp = fopen($path, 'rb');      header("Content-Type: application/pdf");     header("Content-Length: " . filesize($path));     //Experimented with this but all it does is force a download instead of opening in browser.      //header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=".$name);      readfile($path);      //alternately tried     //passthru($fp); } else {     echo "You do not have permission to view this file. Please &lt;a href='../../index.php'&gt;log in&lt;/a&gt;."; }  exit; ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>If I use Content-Disposition in the header the result is any PDF downloaded in Safari or IE is 0KB and not readable. Without content-disposition IE and Safari just hang on a blank page.</p>
