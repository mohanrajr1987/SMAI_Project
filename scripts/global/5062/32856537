<p>I'm in the process of learning C for a coursework assignment. One thing that confuses me is header files. I've tried to find some information regarding my question to no avail.</p>  <p>My question is, say I have 3 different .c files. The convention is (atleast from reading sources) - each .c file has it's own .h file, e.g. parser.c has parser.h, lexer.c has lexer.h, typechecker.c has typechecker.h (if we were making a compiler). </p>  <p>We then go on to add a statement: </p>  <pre><code>#include "parser.h" #include "typechecker.h"  </code></pre>  <p>in the lexer.c file, and do the same with the other .c files (changing the header files we include).</p>  <p>Instead of using that convention, is it okay to add all the prototypes for all 3 <s>classes</s> files into one header, say header.h, and just include that in all 3 <s>classes</s>? The problem with this is that the 3 classes will have prototypes of functions already included in this class, but I don't see this as a problem (I'm a beginner at C so I could be wrong).</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
