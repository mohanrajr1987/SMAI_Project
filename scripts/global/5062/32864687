<p>I would like to redirect users from one old page to a new page usinh PHP Redirect Code. I found this but now the everything is redirecting to the new page and just would like to hape to some specific page. This is the code im using that it´s not working:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php  header("HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently");  header("Location: http://www.New-Website.com");  ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Is there any option to specify just a sub-url to a new url?</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>  <p>I already tried using .htaccess but it´s not working there. So i decided to use this way. Anyway, is it possible even like this? by the way, i tried two codes using .htaccess: </p>  <pre><code>RewriteRule ^stand/index.php(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}/stand-carros-usados$1 [R=301,L]`  </code></pre>  <p>and </p>  <pre><code>Redirect 301 stand/index.php(.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}/stand-carros-usados </code></pre>  <p>but none of them really worked.</p>
