<p>I am having an issue with my header on my website.</p>  <p>When I try to float the logo to the left, and float the nav to the right at the same time, it pushes all the content down and the 'header' joins the 'section' tag.</p>  <p>This is the JSFiddle if you would like to play around with it, any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.</p>  <p><a href="https://jsfiddle.net/wh7wdpmu/" rel="nofollow">https://jsfiddle.net/wh7wdpmu/</a></p>  <pre><code>#logo {     width: 125px;     margin-top: 10px;     display: inline-block; } nav {     display: inline-block; } </code></pre>  <p>(Above is the CSS for the logo and nav so far)</p>
