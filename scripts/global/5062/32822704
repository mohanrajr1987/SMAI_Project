<p>I'm working on CMake project with QtCreator (version 3.4.2). My problem is that in some cases QtCreator cannot find definition of specified symbol ("Follow Symbol Under Cursor" context menu item, F2 key) given that symbol is really defined in included header file. If I press F2 to inspect the included file, QtCreator perfectly finds that header and switches to it. </p>  <p>I thought that the problem was that the header was not considered as "in-project" file so I added these lines to the master CMakeLists.txt:</p>  <pre><code>FILE(GLOB_RECURSE INC_ALL "include/*.hpp") ADD_CUSTOM_TARGET(all_headers SOURCES ${INC_ALL}) </code></pre>  <p>But that doesn't make "Follow symbol under cursor" function working. What's the issue?</p>  <p><strong>EDIT 1:</strong> I found that the function <code>foo()</code> that I was trying to inspect  was in namespace <code>N1</code> while it was called from namespace <code>N2</code> without any namespace specifier:</p>  <pre><code>// file1.hpp namespace N1 {   struct str_t {};   void foo(str_t); } // filw2.cpp #include &lt;file.hpp&gt; namespace N2 {   N1::str_t s;   foo(s);              // not N1::foo(s) } </code></pre>  <p>so that's the case of ADL. Seems that QtCreator simply doesn't treats  ADL situation properly. If I call <code>foo</code> as <code>N1::foo(s)</code> that everything works great.</p>
