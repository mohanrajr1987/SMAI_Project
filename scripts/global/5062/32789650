<p>I read a whole bunch of articles in SO and the internet and tried all of them but I am still unable to create a CSV download functionality in PHP.</p>  <p>Following is my code:</p>  <pre><code>$csvData = @$_POST['csv_data']; if(trim($csvData)) {     header("Cache-Control: must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0");     header('Content-Description: File Transfer');     header("Content-type: text/csv");     header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=data.csv");     header("Expires: 0");     header("Pragma: public");     echo $csvData;     exit;    } </code></pre>  <p>Instead of showing the file save dialog, this keeps printing the CSV data into my browser :( What am I doing wrong here? Any help is much appreciated..</p>  <p>Additional Edit: I am posting this data into my script, which immediately takes this data and tries to download. My script is an include inside another file, will that be a problem? I enabled error_reporting and found that I am getting header already modified error...</p>
