<p>On weebly.com I always get the same 4 headers for landing page, no header, small header, large header... How would I go about summing all of them up into one header of my own similar to this website?</p>  <p><a href="https://www.revivalgame.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.revivalgame.com/</a></p>  <p>They have one overall header and the navigated pages show beneath it. Is weebly even capable of that through it's HTML/CSS?</p>
