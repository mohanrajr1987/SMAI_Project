<p>I have a Magento store with two separate headers.  Let's say out of 20 pages 15 use header.phtml  and 5 use headerGreen.phtml.  I've already created my custom layout module however I can't seem to get the new header to appear on select pages.  The new headerGreen.phtml file has been created as well.  The issue lies when I try to call the new header in the newly created layout page.</p>  <pre><code> &lt;?php echo $this-&gt;getChildHtml('headerGreen') ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I dont think I've added it correctly to the local.xml and was hoping someone could help.</p>  <pre><code>    &lt;default&gt;         &lt;reference name="header"&gt;           &lt;block type="core/template" name="header" template="page/headerGreen.phtml" /&gt;         &lt;/reference&gt;     &lt;/default&gt; </code></pre>
