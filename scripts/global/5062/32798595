<p>I am currently trying to create a website.</p>  <p>I have created the logo for the website but I'm not sure how to make my header and footer background a gradient color on Dreamweaver CS6.</p>  <p>I can only put it as a solid color and I am not sure if I need to use CSS or HTML to change it.</p>  <p>Does anyone know if it is possible, and if it is how to do it?</p>  <p>thanks :)</p>
