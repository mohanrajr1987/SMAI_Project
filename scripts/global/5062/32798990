<p>I know I can MD5 a complete file, this is <strong>not</strong> what I want to do. </p>  <p>I want to get the header and the actual file content. </p>  <p>I know each file has a header and then has the content. I want to compare the actual content of two files to determine if the content is the same and for this I will then use simple md5 on the content. </p>  <p>My issue is how do I separate out the headers from the content so I can do the calculation ? - to make this more clear the offsets is what I will need to know ; will they be the same for all files or different and if different how can I find the details so I can accomplish this . ( I know about gargling but can't find it).</p>  <pre><code>using (var md5 = MD5.Create()) {     using (var stream = File.OpenRead(filename))     {         return md5.ComputeHash(SplitContentFromHeader(stream));     } }   SplitContentFromHeader(stream) { .. do the thing and return the shortened stream  } </code></pre>
