<p>I'm new here. And very new to programming, markup, web dev. I do have some basic understanding of HTML and CSS, but this is my first attempt at using jQuery/Javascript.</p>  <p>Is it possible to use jQuery (or otherwise) to </p>  <p>1- detect if an iframe with <strong>class="iframe1"</strong> appears on a given page and</p>  <p>2- if it does exist, to remove the primary navigation bar with <strong>id="main-header"</strong> ? </p>  <p>I'm currently using this custom CSS to hide the navigation globally:</p>  <pre><code>#main-header { display:none !important; } </code></pre>  <p>and then using this (for example) to replace it on individual pages:</p>  <pre><code>.page-id-1350 #main-header { display:block !important; } </code></pre>  <p>Obviously this is not ideal, and I very much like to automate this process.</p>  <p>Thanks very much in advance, </p>  <p>Chris</p>
