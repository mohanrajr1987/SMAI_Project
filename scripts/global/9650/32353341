As the CLR is replaced by .Net 4.5 is there any difference if I change a working application from targeting .Net 4 to target .Net 4.5? Only this change.</p>  <p>Do I need to regression the application or can I be 100% that the application will work the same as the CLR is the same and I am not using any new feature of .Net 4.5?</p>
