<p>I know that Message Queuing has a Message Size Limit of 4MB, but have recently run into situations where it will be necessary for me to support messages that are greater than 4MB. I have seen it mentioned that it is possible to use a transactional queue and split a message into 'chunks', then re-assemble them on the receiving end, but have seen very little information on how to accomplish this. The messages I am sending contain SQL record data formatted in XML (We use some Nvarchar(MAX) and varbinary(Max) fields, which is why the size limit is an issue. Any assistance in accomplishing this would be most appreciated!</p>
