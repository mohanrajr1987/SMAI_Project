<p>(I don't need alternatives to OleDbDataAdapter.)</p>  <p>The code below finds and reads the file OK but the DGV has four columns (as expected) but all the data rows just have text in the first column. </p>  <pre><code>    Dim sDir As String = "c:\temp\"     Dim sConn = "Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Data Source=" &amp; sDir &amp; ";Extended Properties='text;HDR=Yes;FMT=TabDelimited';"     Dim dt As New DataTable()     Using adapt As New OleDbDataAdapter(String.Format("SELECT TOP 100 * FROM robo.txt"), sConn)         adapt.Fill(dt)     End Using     DataGridView1.DataSource = dt </code></pre>  <p>I would think the Extended Properties would be the only requirement. I've tried add a Schema.ini to no avail - I don't think it is even being read as the column headers never match the schema.</p>  <p>The header row in the most successful pass used commas as separator - this resulted in four columns with the proper names but the tab separated data all in Col1. If I use tabs in the header row I get some system assign columns (3) which sort of corresponds to a data row with two commas.</p>  <p>What am I doing wrong?</p>  <hr>  <p>Here are the first few rows with the tab character being replaced by <code>&lt;tab&gt;</code> . I since noticed that I have an extra column in the data. The fix to the header row below did not fix the problem - all data is dumped into the first field.</p>  <p>Use a tab separator in the header, instead of commas, results in all header text and the data being dumped into the first field.</p>  <pre><code>col1,state,col3,size,path &lt;tab&gt;          same&lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;  102912&lt;tab&gt;\\APCD04T\Data\Thumbs.db &lt;tab&gt;          same&lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;   22016&lt;tab&gt;\\APCD04T\Data\APCD Topical Info\APCD_Boards&amp;Committees_List.doc &lt;tab&gt;          same&lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;   4.3 m&lt;tab&gt;\\APCD04T\Data\APCD Topical Info\LOSSAN-LAtoSLORailCorridorStrategicPlan.pdf </code></pre>
