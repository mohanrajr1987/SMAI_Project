<p>To clarify my question I would like to describe what my application has:</p>  <p><em>Views:</em></p>  <ul> <li>ApplicationView </li> <li>MainView</li> <li>EditEmployeeView</li> </ul>  <p>and their <em>View Models</em>:</p>  <ul> <li>VMApplication</li> <li>VMMain</li> <li>VMEditEmployee</li> </ul>  <p>I have learned how to change view by Command of Button in MVVM pattern</p>  <p></p>  <p>VMApplication code to change view from EditEmployeeView to MainView:</p>  <pre><code>private ICommand saveEditingEmployeeCommand; public ICommand SaveEditingEmployeeCommand {     get     {       if (saveEditingEmployeeCommand == null)       {          saveEditingEmployee = new RelayCommand(             p =&gt; SaveEditingView());       }           return saveEditingViewCommand; ;       }     } public void SaveEditingView() {    CurrentPageViewModel = PageViewModels[0]; } </code></pre>  <p>It works perfectly - the view changes to the MainView from EditEmployeeView, however the code just changes the view and not fires the logic of saving employee(SaveEmplMethod()) located at VMEditEmployee:</p>  <pre><code>private ICommand saveEmplCommand; public ICommand SaveEmplCommand {    get    {       if (saveEmplCommand == null)       {         saveEmplCommand = new RelayCommand(                     p =&gt; SaveEmplMethod());       }         return saveEmplCommand;     } } private void SaveEmplMethod() {   using (EmplEntities db=new EmplEntities())   {     var currentEmpl = db.Employees.First(q=&gt;q.Empl==selectedEmpl);                     currentEmpl.Name="Bob";     db.SaveChanges();                    }  } </code></pre>  <p>My question is <strong>how to save edited Employee and change view to Main View?</strong> Is my approach right? Any examples and advices would be greatly appreciated!</p>
