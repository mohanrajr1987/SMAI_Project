<p>I'm trying to prevent users from making requests to access images on their own in my web application, so the user shouldn't be allowed to make this type of request:</p>  <p>sitename/Images/test.jpg</p>  <p>I've tried specifying a route to ignore in RouteConfig.cs but it still serves images on their own, is there a way to prevent this?</p>  <p>This is what I've tried:</p>  <pre><code>routes.IgnoreRoute("{file}.jpg"); routes.IgnoreRoute("Images/{file}.jpg"); routes.IgnoreRoute("{resource}.jpg"); routes.IgnoreRoute("Images/{resource}.jpg"); </code></pre>
