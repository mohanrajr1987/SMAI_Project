<p>I have a Windows Service project which wrote by VS2010, C#, Target .NET Framework 4.0. I used to debug it in VS2010 (Administrator mode) without any problem.</p>  <p>And then, I install VS2015 Community on yesterday. When I want to debug (F5) my project in VS2010, it raise an <code>AccessViolationException</code>. If I choose run without debug (Ctrl+F5), my project still working without any exception.</p>  <p>I tried to set some breakpoints in <code>main()</code>, constructor, Service Entry-points, but the exception still raised before any breakpoints be hit. In other words, I think this exception is not caused by my project, it should be a bug of VS.</p>  <p>Therefore, I search some article about <code>VS AccessViolationException</code>, and I found that my situation is similar to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19578568/vs-2012-2013-accessviolationexception">this SO article</a> and tried the solution provided by <a href="https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/819552/visual-studio-debugger-throws-accessviolationexception" rel="nofollow">Microsoft Connect</a> (Both of 4.5.2 framework and dev-pack are installed). However, it's still not work.</p>  <p>Any suggestion, please?</p>
