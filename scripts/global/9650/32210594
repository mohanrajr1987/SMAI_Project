<p>Given this code:</p>  <pre><code>Task.Factory.StartNew(() =&gt; {     Application.Current.Dispatcher.Invoke(() =&gt;     {         //Code to run on UI thread     });     //Code to run on a background thread                              }). </code></pre>  <p>Is it safe to assume that "Code to run on a background thread" will not be reached under any circumstances until "Code to run on UI thread" is finished executing?</p>
