<p>I use small aplication, it works fine on windows 8.1, after I upgrade to windows 10 after run application I get Unhandled exception </p>  <pre><code>System.IO.FileLoadException: Mixed mode assembly is built against version 'v2.0.50727' of the runtime and cannot be loaded in the 4.0 runtime without additional configuration information. </code></pre>  <p>Can I do something with it, without re-compile? I no longer have the source code. Maybe edit MSIL, SetUp old runtime...??</p>  <p>Thanks for help </p>
