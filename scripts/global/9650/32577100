<p>What I want to accomplish here is to remove any of the needles that is found in the current haystack.</p>  <p>The condition is if I want the found needles to be removed from the end of the haystack or the beginning of the haystack</p>  <p>eg</p>  <p>.com google .com</p>  <p>.com bing .com</p>  <p>.com yahoo .com</p>  <p>.org google .org </p>  <p>.org bing .org</p>  <p>.org yahoo .org </p>  <p>From this example, lets say I want to remove all .org and .com that are at the end of each strings</p>  <pre><code>    private string BeginningOrEnd(string haystack)     {         // needles is a string array          // if any of the needles is found in the current haystack         if (needles.Any(haystack.Contains))         {             if (lookingAtTheEnd)             {                 // for a single needle, normally I would do                 haystack = haystack.Substring(0, haystack.LastIndexOf(singleNeedle));                  // ???                 // so for an array of needles, do I have to do a needles loop here, and remove each needle if found?                 // I am hoping there is a different, maybe simpler approach                 //             }              // else if lookingAtTheBeginning             else             {                 // here as well for a single needle, normally I would do                 haystack = haystack.Substring(haystack.IndexOf(singleNeedle) + singleNeedle.Length);                  // ???                 // needles loop here as well?                 //             }         }          return haystack;     } </code></pre>
