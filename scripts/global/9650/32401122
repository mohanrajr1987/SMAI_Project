<p>I'm trying to create multiple instances of same part imported using DirectoryCatalog, in order to let classes i already have use a "personal" instance of same part like so:</p>  <pre><code>interface TMyType {     some method... }  public class PluginHelper {     ImportMany of type TMyType with CreationPolicy non shared     ...      public bool GetPluginByName(string name)     {         GetPlugin based on name requested     } }  class A {     plugin = PluginHelper.GetPluginByName("PLUGIN1") }  class B {     plugin = PluginHelper.GetPluginByName("PLUGIN1") } </code></pre>  <p>This actually works but A.plugin is same instance as B.plugin... Using .Net 4 (Not 4.5) looks like i should move the import in each class and then select the desired plugin there. I know I can use Lazy in order to avoid creation of parts at composition, but still looks kinda ugly...</p>  <p>Been googling quite a lot to no avail.</p>  <p>TIA</p>
