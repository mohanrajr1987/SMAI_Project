<p>Just on some PCs, with "strange" video sizes, a WinForm app fails to correctly set the size of anchored controls. Strange e.g. a TV used as VGA device. Resize is working OK on Win7 desktops, but I need the app to work the same in conference rooms.</p>  <pre><code>Private Sub frmSearch2_ResizeEnd(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Me.ResizeEnd     Dim s As String = ""     s &amp;= "me.size " &amp; Me.Size.ToString &amp; vbNewLine     s &amp;= "Me.ClientSize " &amp; Me.ClientSize.ToString &amp; vbNewLine     s &amp;= "dgv size: " &amp; dgv01.Size.ToString &amp; vbNewLine ' initially incorrect     s &amp;= "panel size: " &amp; Panel1.Size.ToString ' initially incorrect     Clipboard.SetText(s)     dgv01.Width = Me.ClientSize.Width - (dgv01.Left * 2) ' manually set width based on ClientSize End Sub </code></pre>  <p>Executed on the problem PC:</p>  <pre><code>me.size {Width=941, Height=578} Me.ClientSize {Width=925, Height=540} dgv size: {Width=939, Height=361} panel size: {Width=964, Height=52} </code></pre>  <p>Note the dgv is wider than the client area even though it is anchored on all sides. Height is resizing properly. I added a Panel docked to left and right edges to see if it would resize properly - nope. Changing AutoScaleMode doesn't seem to help - didn't try all possibilities. Remember: scaling works on most PCs properly.</p>  <p>The last line of code that sets the DGV width manually is visually OK. This would be OK for a very simple form but I have many controls, some hosted in other controls, that need the same attention.</p>  <p>Likely a video driver problem but the code shows the WinForm has the proper ClientSize, it just isn't using that value to resize the controls.</p>  <p>Is there something I can call to force the WinForm to reprocess the anchors using the valid ClientSize? Or??</p>
