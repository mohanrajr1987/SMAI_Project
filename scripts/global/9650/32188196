<p>my problem is that I can't use the jsonserializer class from System.Web.Extensions or any NuGet packages to convert my json/c# objects because I want to do it within stored procedures on the server. </p>  <p>It's a sql server 2014 running .net 4.0.</p>  <p>I already tried to add the assembly as unsafe but can't get it to work because of the assemblies it depends on (or references).</p>  <p>So now my questions is if anyone of you knows if there is a already implemented class I could use or if I have to write my own json serializer.</p>  <p>Thanks for your help</p>  <p>Edit: Sorry for not being clear enough.</p>  <p>With "convert" I meant serializing an deserializing. Normally I would use the jsonserializer class but what could I use in a stored procedure?</p>
