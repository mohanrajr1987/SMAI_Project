<p>I run application targeted to .NET Framework 4.0. Then I open modules to check what libraries are used. I see that mscorlib version is 4.6.96.0. But in output windows I can see that Framework 4.0 is loaded? I believe that the application use .NET Framework 4.0. I don't understand why version of mscorlib is 4.6.96.0. Why it is?  And what does mean "built by: NETFXREL2STAGE" - please see screenshot. <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/GkyCW.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/GkyCW.png" alt="screenshot"></a>.</p>
