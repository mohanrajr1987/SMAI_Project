<p>I have a c# application that recieves HTML POST data. Now how do I take form data that was stored in variable?</p>  <p>This is what gets stored from the post data </p>  <pre><code>------------------------------0123abcdefab Content-Disposition: form-data; name="caption"   ------------------------------0123abcdefab Content-Disposition: form-data; name="image"; filename="snapshot.jpg" Content-Type: image/jpg  ???? JFIF      ?? C           ------------------------------0123abcdefab-- </code></pre>  <p>notice how both form fields are stored as one in a string variable. how do i split this into 2 separate variables? </p>  <p>also how do i store the image form data in a variable so it can still be written as a image?</p>
