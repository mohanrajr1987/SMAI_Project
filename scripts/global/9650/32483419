<p>I am using Microsoft.BCL.Async in a .Net 4.0 application. I have created an entity framework (version 6) model and am trying to materialise a query against it using .ToListAsync. ToListAsync isn't being recognised though - there's no intellisense for it, and ignoring this gives an error that it's not a member of IQueryAble(Of ...). I'm using Visual Studio 2015.</p>  <p>Here's a simple example of the usage:</p>  <pre><code>  Private Async Function FetchData() As Tasks.Task     Using session As New TestEntities       Dim data = Await session.Clients.ToListAsync     End Using   End Function </code></pre>  <p>Should I be able to use ToListAsync in the above scenario, and if so what might I be missing to get it working? ToList <em>is</em> available. </p>
