<p>I have an application without sources, using MySql DataBase 3.23, C# .net-4.0.</p>  <p>I can't update to the new version, and, I must retrieve the new data on update table. The trigger can't be used for this version. Of course I have user and password for log in. You help me please on how can I extract the new records? thanks in advance. </p>  <p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>  <pre><code>CREATE TABLE PREPARATI (      TIPO CHAR(1),      UNITA CHAR(30),      PARAMETRO CHAR(30) ,     CODICE CHAR(30),      PRODOTTO CHAR(30),      LOTTO CHAR(30) ,     FASE CHAR(30),      STATO smallint,      BEGIN_T int,      END_T int,      TOT_T int,      INCR_T int,      N_SAMPLES int,      TOT_Q float,      INCR_Q float,      GLOB_Q float,      MIN_Q float,      MAX_Q float,      CAUSA smallint,      FMT_COD CHAR(1),     TIPO_COD smallint,     CODES CHAR(254),      INDEX Xtime (BEGIN_T, END_T) ); </code></pre>  <p>Instead of timestamps, there is a column that stores the time in milliseconds upon update. I need to retrieve the newly added record.</p>
