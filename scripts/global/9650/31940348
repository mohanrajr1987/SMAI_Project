<p>I’m having a WCF application with 30 methods exposed to client.In that one of the method is communicating to 10 external web services (sequentially) after that responding to client. Currently in config file <code>receiveTimeout</code> has been set to 1 minute for each of the 10 external web service (my WCF application should respond to client within 5 minutes to overcome the browser time out issue), If one of the 10 external web services is failing to respond within 1 minute then I’m throwing time-out error to my client application.</p>  <p><strong>Problem:</strong>        In external web services communication, The application handling the financial related data, based on the successful processing.</p>  <p><strong>Question :</strong>        Is it possible to capture the external web service’s response from application after timeout sent to client?</p>
