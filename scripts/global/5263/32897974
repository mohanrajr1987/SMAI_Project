<p>Is there a way to construct some type of static construct to hold Core Data entity and attribute references?  This will prevent having to type in string literals.</p>  <p>For example, say I have an entity named Item with attributes field1, field2, field three.  I'd like to structure them this way:</p>  <pre><code>CoreDataReference {  Item = "Item"     field1 = "field1",     field2 = "field1",     field3 = "field three"   Item2 = "Item2"     field1 = "field1",     field2 = "field1",     field3 = "field three" } </code></pre>  <p>Then be able to reference them in code like this:</p>  <pre><code>CoreDataReference.Item.RawValue (this gives back the string value) CoreDataReference.Item.field3.RawValue </code></pre>  <p>Each attribute is grouped with its entity.  The static construct allows for easy hints that display each attribute by entity.  </p>  <p>This might be a static class, struct, or enum.  I'm not sure how to construct it to work like the above syntax.  Any ideas how this might be done?</p>
