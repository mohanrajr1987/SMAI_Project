<p>Language: Swift 2.0, iOS Version: 9.0, XCode 7.0</p>  <p>Firstly, I'm pretty new to apple products programming but I understand quite a bit, I am in need some some assistance on an issue.</p>  <p>Currently I'm trying to record a single set of Lat/Long every 10 mins when the user of the device Clocks in for work to track their day.  This is for truck driver deliveries to keep them honest and not cheating the customer.</p>  <p>Currently it doesn't work as advertised. If the phone goes to sleep, app is taken to the background, or even home button is used, the 10 minute timer is suspended at some point.  I'm requesting a small example of how one would do this or an alternative.</p>
