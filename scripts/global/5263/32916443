<p>I have built an app using CoreData with iCloud for persistent cloud storage. Recently I've discovered I need to be able to parse .csv files into my data.</p>  <p>I was thinking it might be easier to make an OSX app to do this than trying to make iOS do it. Am I correct?</p>  <p>Is it possible to share one ubiquitous container between a OSX app and an iOS app? Or would I be better off trying to figure out a way to import the .csv document into iCloud CoreData on the iOS device?</p>  <p>I realize cloudkit can do this, but I am wedded to CoreData/iCloud Ubiquitous container at this point :(</p>  <p>Looking for any advice that can help! Thanks.</p>
