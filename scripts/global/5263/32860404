<p>I want to know what is the best way to get count of related entities in to-many relationship. Let's say I have a data model that looks like this (simplified), and I want to know the number of passengers for each bus:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/EdHwv.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/EdHwv.png" alt="data model"></a></p>  <p>Currently I can think of two options:</p>  <ol> <li><p>Add an extra attribute to bus entity called <em>passengerCount</em> which will be updated every time a passenger is added/removed.</p></li> <li><p>Every time the count of passengers needs to be displayed, it's done by fetching the passengers and displaying their count.</p></li> </ol>  <p>Both of my options seem quite inefficient, even though I'm not aware how heavy it is to update/fetch values with core data. For example, imagine doing number 2 for every table view cell.</p>  <p>My question is: What is the best way to do this? A method in NSManagedObject class perhaps (I couldn't find any) or some other way that is more efficient?</p>
