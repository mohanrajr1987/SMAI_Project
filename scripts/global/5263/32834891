<p>I have very simple structure relations</p>  <p>FeedItem - root object, it's has object post.</p>  <pre><code>"FeedItem" {  "post" :        {"id" : 1, "name" : "Test"} } </code></pre>  <p>I made NSFetchedResultsController to a FeedItem, but in one case i make changes in post object.</p>  <p>I wonder, if it's possible to make NSFetchedResultsController trigger when changed related object?</p>  <p>I found solution via </p>  <pre><code>[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self                                                  selector:@selector(refreshData:)                                                      name:NSManagedObjectContextObjectsDidChangeNotification                                                    object:nil]; </code></pre>  <p>But in this case i need manually check if there in notification has my objects, because it's contains all objects which be updated, added, deleted.</p>
