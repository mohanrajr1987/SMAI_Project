<p>I've inherited some swift code which performs a refreshObject immediately after fetching from core data.  The objects being fetched have a relationship to another table.  The fetch and refreshObject are inside a performBlockAndWait.  The code is below.  The crash appeared to begin in iOS9.</p>  <ul> <li>Any idea why the refreshObject is throwing EXC_BAD_ACCESS?  What is the fix?</li> <li><p>What is the purpose of doing a refreshObject immediately after the fetch?  This table contains just a few rows.  Is this necessary?  Any downside to removing all together?</p>  <pre><code>context.performBlockAndWait {     let className = self.className()     let fetchRequest = NSFetchRequest(entityName: className)     groups = (try? context.executeFetchRequest(fetchRequest)) as? [FavoriteLocationGroup]     if groups != nil {         groups!.sortInPlace { $0.name &lt; $1.name }         for group in groups! {             context.refreshObject(group, mergeChanges: false) &lt;&lt;&lt; crashes here         }     } } </code></pre></li> </ul>  <p>Thanks in advance for any help you can provide!</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/t8Jfq.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/t8Jfq.jpg" alt="value of context"></a></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8nnlD.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8nnlD.jpg" alt="what group is"></a></p>
