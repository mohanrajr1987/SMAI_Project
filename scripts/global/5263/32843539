<p>There are lots of tutorials out there describing how to fetch JSON objects from the web and map them to Core Data.</p>  <p>I'm currently working on an iOS (later: Android as well) app which loads json objects from web and displays them to the user. In my opinion all this mapping from and to Core Data is an overhead in this case, it would be much easier to save the JSON objects directly and use them as "cache" in the app. Are there libraries/documented ways how to achieve fetching json objects, save them locally and fetch them with a predefined identifier?</p>  <p>I would love to fetch e.g. 10 objects, show them to the user and save the data locally. The next time the user is on that list the local data is shown and in the background the json-file is fetched again to be up-to-date. I guess this is a common use case but I didn't find any tutorials/frameworks enabling exactly this.</p>
