<p>So I can't figure this out, am I supposed to change the '.text' to something else or do I have to go about converting the string into a double?</p>  <p>Here is the code</p>  <pre><code>if item != nil {     // the errors I keep getting for each one is     unitCost.text = item?.unitCost //cannot assign to a value 'NSNumber?' to a value of type 'String?'     total.text = item?.total  //cannot assign to a value 'NSNumber?' to a value of type 'String?'     date.text = item?.date //cannot assign to a value 'NSDate?' to a value of type 'String?' } </code></pre>
