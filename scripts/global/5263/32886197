<p>Working on a part of my iOS project that needs to refer to a specific object that the user selects in the main application that is set through a toggle switch that activates the specified object to be used in a Today Extension to record simple objects created by the user in the Today Extension. I am unsure how to go about doing this specifically. I thought about using NSUSerDefaults as the go to method for specifying that object but this is all entirely new to me. Has anyone gone down this path before on here? Does anyone know a way to refer to the specific object you want to store to in the Today Extension?</p>
