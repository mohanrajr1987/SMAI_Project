<p>For example, i have 10 000 entries in database, and i need to display them into a UITableView.</p>  <p>So, i should setup all the NSCoreData stuff, create NSFetchRequest, and NSFetchedResultsController.</p>  <p>Then i could access these entries in cellForRowAtIndexPath with [NSFetchedResultsController objectAtIndex] method.</p>  <p><strong>The questions is:</strong> </p>  <ol> <li>Will NSFetchedResultsController load all these objects in a LAZY way, only after user actually SCROLL UITableView to a corresponding cells?</li> <li>Is it enough just to set NSFetchRequest's fetchBatchSize to a number equal to cell count on screen?</li> <li>Should i use separate NSManagedObjectContext with background thread for loading these objects? In case of separate thread, how will work [NSFetchedResultsController objectAtIndex] method, while it called from Main-UI-thread?</li> <li>Should i even worry about these things, while i have just 10k entries?</li> </ol>
