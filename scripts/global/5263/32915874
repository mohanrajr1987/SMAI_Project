<p>I'm attempting to use NSBatchDeleteRequest to delete a pile of entities, many of these entities have delete cascade and/or nullify rules.</p>  <p>My first attempt to delete anything fails and the NSError I get back includes the string "Delete rule is not supported for batch deletes".  I had thought it was fine to delete such things but i was responsible for making sure all the constraints are satisfied before I do a save.</p>  <p>Should I be able to batch delete these managed objects?   (I want to keep the delete rules, other delete paths don't have an easy way to know what set of objects to delete)    Do some kinds of batch deletes work in this case, but others not?  (say predicates fail, but a list of object IDs work?)</p>
