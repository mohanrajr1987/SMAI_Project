Having two entities:</p>  <ul> <li>Person</li> </ul>  <p>property: name</p>  <p>relationship: department (to-one, non-optional)</p>  <ul> <li>Department</li> </ul>  <p>property: title (unique constraint)</p>  <p>relationship: person (to-many, optional)</p>  <p>Model won't compile in iOS 9, XCode 7.0.1 with misconfigured entity error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Misconfigured Entity: Entity Department cannot have uniqueness   constraints and to-one mandatory inverse relationship   Person.department</p> </blockquote>
