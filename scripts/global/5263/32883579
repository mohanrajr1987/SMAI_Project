<p>So, plenty of issues have been posted around this like:</p>  <ul> <li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32233939/core-data-failed-to-load-optimized-model-at-path/32771126#32771126">Stack Overflow Question</a> </li> <li><a href="https://code.google.com/p/gmaps-api-issues/issues/detail?id=8459" rel="nofollow">Google Code Issue Report</a>.</li> </ul>  <p>The problem in few words is the following: GoogleMaps SDK has an error when updating to XCode 7 GM (consequently using Swift 2), because when loading the bundle resources, apparently it can't find/read the '.mom'/'.omo' file.</p>  <pre><code>'CoreData: Failed to load optimized model at path '.../APP_NAME/GoogleMaps.bundle/GMSCacheStorage.momd/Storage.omo'  </code></pre>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32233939/core-data-failed-to-load-optimized-model-at-path/32771126#32771126">This answer explains</a> a workaround if I were to load the resources mannually or if using a POD, but <strong><em>my problem is that I'm linking to the static library manually to support iOS 7.x</em></strong> (long story, Pods on swift only work with dynamic libraries and iOS 7 doesn't support them, but it worked perfectly until XCode 7/Swift 2). Maybe someone knows a way to hack into the GoogleMaps.bundle inside the framework file...</p>  <p>I'm thinking of something like -> (right-click GoogleMaps.bundle + Show Package Contents + 'maybe change some file paths/extensions?')</p>  <p>Apart from the Log Error, Google Maps functionality (at least the features I'm using) work fine in the app. The problem is when uploading to the App Store, I receive an error because of this.</p>
