<p>I wish to check whether we can restrict the supported languages listed in the <em>language</em> portlet based on the user organization or group.</p>  <p>We have a page with the language portlet which is configured with the languages "English", "French", "German" etc</p>  <p>We have users:</p>  <ul> <li><p>German users</p>  <ul> <li>Belong to <em>org1</em> from <em>Germany</em> </li> <li>When this type of user visits our page, he should see "English" and "Germin" in the language portlet only.</li> </ul></li> <li><p>Other users</p>  <ul> <li>Belong to <em>org2</em> from global ops </li> <li>When this type of user visits our page, he should see all configured languages.</li> </ul></li> </ul>  <p>Can we achieve this with native Liferay or do we need to use a hook to achieve it?</p>
