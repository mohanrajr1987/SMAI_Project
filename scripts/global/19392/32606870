<p>I have been given a task to migrate users from customers database to liferay portal.</p>  <p>I have already managed to find all the places I need to fill with data, to make a user functional (USER_, USERS_GROUPS, CONTACT_, LAYOUTSET, EXPANDOVALUE).</p>  <p>The only problem I have faced are the IDs. Liferay doesn't use a sequence to generate them (at least I haven't found one), but appears to generate them from the code. What's even more concerning, It looks like all the IDs (UserID, GroupId, RowID, etc) need to be unique not only in scope of a table, but whole database.</p>  <p>I need to find a way to get the last used ID in database and a way to set last ID used by my script, so that Liferay doesn't use it again.</p>  <p>I don't have access to an application server, just the database, that's why I can't use the API...</p>
