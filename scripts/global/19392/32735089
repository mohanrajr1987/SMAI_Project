<p>I am using Liferay 6.2 and PostgreSQL 9.4.4 on localhost. </p>  <p>I created basic web contents and tried to display them with the Web Display Content Portlet but the contents do not show up under the setup tab of the portlet. </p>  <p>I also tried making the page a display page by setting up a default Asset Publisher but that too did not help. However, if I add a fresh content to the portlet right on the page it displays on the portlet. </p>  <p>Again, even the contents created on the portlet directly do not show up in the selection list. </p>  <p>I followed the Liferay documentation in all my steps. </p>  <p>Has anyone had this issue before? is there something I am doing wrong or is this a bug in Liferay 6.2? </p>  <p>Thanks for any help.</p>
