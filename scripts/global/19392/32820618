<p>I added a nested-portlet inside my page. This nested-portlet is a 2-column 50-50 layout. I am able to insert a portlet inside that, but I can't insert one next to another one, although the layout of the nested-portlet has two columns.</p>  <p>Is there anything I am missing?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/bHVon.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/bHVon.png" alt="Nested-portlet Configuration"></a></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/O6oL8.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/O6oL8.png" alt="Unable to move portlet next to another one"></a></p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Ok, there is a problem related to the custom theme used. If I set the default theme of Liferay, the problem disappears.</p>  <p><strong>SOLVED</strong>: The problem was that the theme I installed forced the portlet divs to be <em>display: block;</em>. I changed that as <em>display:table-cell</em> and the problem disappeared.</p>
