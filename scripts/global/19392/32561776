<p>I'm working on a liferay portlet. What I want to do is opening a new jsp with sending to it a URL parameter coming from javascript variable. I thought about it and I found two ideas:</p>  <p>1)Send the js variable to the jsp using ajax and then create a render url in jsp with a parameter the value received from js. But how I send js variable to jsp I don't find a good example in the internet.</p>  <p>2)Build the render url in javascript using the received parameter and then redirect from the script itself to the new jsp file using the render url that I found. For this idea I posted this question <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32520452/liferay-portlet-redirect-to-an-other-jsp-page-from-javascript">Liferay portlet: redirect to an other jsp page from javascript</a> but I didn't get solution for it yet.</p>  <p>Has someone a suggestion how I can achieve what I want using one of my ideas or may be an other idea?</p>
