<p>My page renders correctly in IE11 with compatibility mode off.  With compatibility mode on it renders incorrectly.  I have attempted to coerce IE into document mode 11 in the following ways: </p>  <p>1) Using the META tag: &lt;head&gt; &lt;meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"&gt; </p>  <p>2) Setting a key/value in the HTTP response header: X-UA-Compatible/IE=edge</p>  <p>In both cases the document.documentMode attr in IE reads as 11 even when compatibility mode is on.  However, it will still render incorrectly.</p>  <p>Does anyone know what is going on?  It seems I've successfully instructed IE to use IE11 mode in multiple ways.  I know IE11 mode works for my page because there isn't a problem in IE11 with compatibility mode off.  </p>  <p>In case it matters, I'm using Liferay Portal 6.1.20 EE.</p>
