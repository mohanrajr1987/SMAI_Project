<p>I want to figure out how to make one thing in Liferay. I am using a lot of custom portlets and faced a problem. I want to have my custom portlet as a through element in my portal. For example custom "searchbar" in my portal header as a portlet. But the problem is that I need the same instance for it, because every time when I will surf new page, every time It will be a new instance. I'm right? I need something like singleton. How can I do it with liferay? And, of course, how can I make portlet as a through element?</p>
