<p>I have been using Liferay for work for 2 weeks. I noticed that it's a bit difficult to find good documentation and tutorials. Until now I created pages from the web portal. After I create them, I drag and drop portlets. I don't really like this approach, I would prefer to use a coding approach. Is there a way to create a website or page programmatically by defining a project as I do to create portlets?</p>  <p>Moreover, I am using Liferay with WebLogic 10.3.6. I want to know where liferay puts pages I created via web-portal on the file system. I suppose that a file, or something similar, is created when I declare a new site on the Liferay web-portal. </p>  <p>Thank you all,</p>  <p>Marco</p>
