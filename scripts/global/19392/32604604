<p>I am using liferay 6.2 and I created a organization and site of that organization. after adding user to the organization.I was editing site configuration, i noticed that my liferay is not showing the "allow manual membership management checkbox". I am not able to figure out why that option is not visible. i want to enable the manual membership management for organization sites. Any idea why it's not there?<a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/CNzrF.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/CNzrF.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
