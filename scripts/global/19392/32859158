<p>I created a hook and added one additional field in <code>forgot_password.jsp</code>. My problem is how to handle it.I read I should create an action and the action I should change is <code>ForgotPasswordAction.java</code>. I don't know much about struts and I am new to liferay. Do u know how to make this input in <code>forgot_password.jsp</code> works:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;aui:input label="&lt;%= firstName %&gt;" name="&lt;%= firstNameParameter%&gt;" size="30" type="text" value="&lt;%= firstNameValue%&gt;"&gt;     &lt;aui:validator name="required" /&gt; &lt;/aui:input&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I guess I should get the name from here:</p>  <pre><code>User user2 = (User)request.getAttribute(WebKeys.FORGOT_PASSWORD_REMINDER_USER); </code></pre>  <p>but what I should put in firstNameParameter? From where I should get it?</p>  <p>The point is to add a field to forgot_password.jsp to make the user write his first name in order to change his password. This is additional requirement to this page.
