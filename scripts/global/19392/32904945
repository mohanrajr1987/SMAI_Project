<p>I've created a configuration for the Liferay Service Builder. After this I tried to build services, but I received the following error:</p>  <pre><code>Buildfile: C:\LiferayNew\liferay-plugins-sdk-6.2\portlets\guestbook-portlet\build.xml  BUILD FAILED C:\LiferayNew\liferay-plugins-sdk-6.2\portlets\guestbook-portlet\build.xml:5: The following error occurred while executing this line: C:\LiferayNew\liferay-plugins-sdk-6.2\portlets\build-common-portlet.xml:5: The following error occurred while executing this line: C:\LiferayNew\liferay-plugins-sdk-6.2\build-common-plugin.xml:5: The following error occurred while executing this line: C:\LiferayNew\liferay-plugins-sdk-6.2\build-common.xml:60: The following error occurred while executing this line: C:\LiferayNew\liferay-plugins-sdk-6.2\build-common-ivy.xml:71: The following error occurred while executing this line: C:\LiferayNew\liferay-plugins-sdk-6.2\build-common-ivy.xml:55: java.net.MalformedURLException: no protocol: ${ivy.jar.url}  Total time: 1 second. </code></pre>  <p>How I can solve this issue?</p>
