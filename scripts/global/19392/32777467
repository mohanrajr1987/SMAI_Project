<p>I'd like to develop a servlet whichs works as a datalayer between a porlet written in JavaScript (ExtJS) and a database.</p>  <p>Thus I downloaded Eclipse JavaEE and created a sample servlet project. I also successfully deployed a servlet which receives a http-get-request, calls the DB and outputs the result.</p>  <p>But everyone who nows the servlet-uri can call it and sees the result. Thats where it gets tricky - how do I secure my servlet so that only a authenticated/logged in user can call my servlet or how can my servlet check wether the requester is a valid user?</p>  <p>There is a similar question about that Topic but I'm not sure if this is about the same problem: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20950689/how-to-create-a-top-level-servlet-in-liferay">How to create a top-level servlet in liferay</a></p>  <p>Unfortunately I have no clue how to get the liferay-libraries (e.g. PortalUtil) into my servlet-project. How do I do this step by step?</p>  <p>Is this concept even a good way to secure the datalayer or are there better options?</p>  <p>Any help is appreciated!</p>
