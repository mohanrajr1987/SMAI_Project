<p>on the web there are many resources about exporting a development database (HSQL) into a production one (eg. MySQL), but I need to move data in the opposite way.</p>  <p>I usually use the Liferay embedded function to export data to a new database, but it needs for a running database server instance (and it seems to be impossible using HSQL).</p>  <p>Does a way to achieve this goal exist in Liferay 6.2?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
