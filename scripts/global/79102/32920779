<p>How can I export the one database table from parse.com into a *.csv file which is stored in parse online? I just once got a file in the following format and now I need to do that on my own:</p>  <p><a href="http://files.parsetfss.com/f0e70754-45fe-43c2-5555-6a8a0795454f/tfss-63214f6e-1f09-481c-83a2-21a70d52091f-STUDENT.csv" rel="nofollow">http://files.parsetfss.com/f0e70754-45fe-43c2-5555-6a8a0795454f/tfss-63214f6e-1f09-481c-83a2-21a70d52091f-STUDENT.csv</a></p>  <p>So, the question is how can I do this? I have not found a dashboard function yet</p>  <p>Thank you very much</p>
