<p>I have an application running on both iOS and Android platforms. They are the same version, but Parse logs two different types of version in PFInstallation objects.</p>  <p>As you can see in the screenshot below, on Android is logged the short version code, while on iOS is logged the build version code. Why?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8Yuir.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8Yuir.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
