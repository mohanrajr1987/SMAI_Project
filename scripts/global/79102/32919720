<p>Recently, I have been hitting Parse rate limit every time my servers try to upload data to Parse. What is not clear to me is why.</p>  <p>I use batch inserts, batch updates and batch deletes. I even throttle the batch operations themselves (0.25 seconds between operations) yet I still get this in my logs:</p>  <pre><code>10/03/2015 04:05:17 AM loading to Parse 10/03/2015 04:05:50 AM Inserted: 851 10/03/2015 04:05:50 AM Updated: {u'code': 155, u'error': u'This application performed 1802 requests within the past minute, and exceeded its request limit. Please retry in one  minute or raise your request limit.'} </code></pre>  <p>What I am not clear about is whether a batch still counts as individual operation or does Parse look at it as 50 inserts (for example). If it does then what's the point? If it does not treat a batch as individual operations then how can 1802 requests broken down to batches of 50 in 0.25 secs bursts hit this limit?</p>  <p>And before you ask, no app tester is even trying to pull the data as they were all asleep!!!</p>  <p>I followed/read various links including <a href="https://parse.com/plans/faq" rel="nofollow">this</a> one and <a href="https://www.parse.com/questions/30-requests-per-second-equates-to-how-many-concurrent-users" rel="nofollow">this</a> one but am still puzzled.</p>  <p>Any advice will be appreciated. </p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
