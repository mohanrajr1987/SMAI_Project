<p>I know that Parse doesnt have primary key , but objectId. But I have an existing database where there is a primary key itemId in everyclass. And if I use a pointer I dont get the results I want because all the items are connected though the itemId. Can for example somehow make every objectId equal to itemId so that the relationship can fetch the one-to-many items from the other tables ?</p>  <p>I am using Swift and iOS.</p>
