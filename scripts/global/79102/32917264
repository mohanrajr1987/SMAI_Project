<p>I realise there are many questions for this but none specific to my problem. I am using the iOS SDK for Parse, v1.8.5 (latest). Every time I try to <code>saveInBackground...</code> on <code>PFUser.currentUser()</code> I get this error occurring and when I pause the program and check <code>po PFUser.currentUser()</code> in the console it displays the current user fine and logged in with no problems. I do not understand why I am getting this problem then..?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
