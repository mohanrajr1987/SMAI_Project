<p>I have a recyclerview and it contains a cardview, I load imases and strings in it from my database on Parse.com </p>  <p>So far I have like 7 items in my list and all is fine so far.</p>  <p>What I would like to know is what happens when I have like 1000+ items in my recyclerview will it start to slow down the app? Do I need to put my recyclerview inside of an AsyncTask to prevent this?</p>  <p>Or does Glide image Loader library solve this issue?(i assume it will only solve this issue if I only used images in my recycler view and I would have to put my strings that are being loaded inside the recyclerview in their own AsyncTask)</p>  <p>Or do I simply need to put the entire PasreQuery that I used to fetch all the data including images into an AsyncTask?</p>  <p>This is very important as I I don't want a few years from now when the app is being used it hangs when 1000, 2000, 3000 etc items are now being placed in the recyclerview from my database.</p>
