<p>I have been trying to make an app with PARSE but I can't run it because I keep getting an error saying :</p>  <p>"Cannot invoke 'suscribeToChanelInBackground' with an argument list of type '(String, (Bool , NSError?)) -> ())''" </p>  <p>And it is pointing to the line of code:</p>  <pre><code>PFPush.subscribeToChannelInBackground((succeeded: Bool, error: NSError?)){ </code></pre>  <p>Which is in the Push Notifications Section:</p>  <pre><code>func application(application: UIApplication, didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: NSData) {     let installation = PFInstallation.currentInstallation()     installation.setDeviceTokenFromData(deviceToken)     installation.saveInBackground()      PFPush.subscribeToChannelInBackground((succeeded: Bool, error: NSError?)){         if succeeded {             print("ParseStarterProject successfully subscribed to push notifications on the broadcast channel.\n");         } else {             print("ParseStarterProject failed to subscribe to push notifications on the broadcast channel with error = %@.\n", error)         }     } }  func application(application: UIApplication, didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError error: NSError) {     if error.code == 3010 {         print("Push notifications are not supported in the iOS Simulator.\n")     } else {         print("application:didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError: %@\n", error)     } }  func application(application: UIApplication, didReceiveRemoteNotification userInfo: [NSObject : AnyObject]) {     PFPush.handlePush(userInfo)     if application.applicationState == UIApplicationState.Inactive {         PFAnalytics.trackAppOpenedWithRemoteNotificationPayload(userInfo)     } } </code></pre>  <p>So I can't figure out what to do, I have been looking all over the web about it and I think it might be something to be to do with the new swift update Swift 2.0 (which I am using along with Xcode 7 beta) Is it my code , or parse's to do with the new swift? I have tried commenting it out because I don't need notifications in my app though apparently you need that section of code, and I might have to use the same code somewhere else which I think you do. Thank you in advance. </p>
