<p>I am creating web app on <code>Windows 10</code> and using <a href="http://blog.parse.com/announcements/goodbye-web-servers-hello-parse-hosting/" rel="nofollow">Parse</a> but I am unable to use <a href="https://www.parse.com/apps/quickstart#hosting/windows" rel="nofollow">Parse: Command Line Tool</a>. I have followed the tutorial and I am facing the following issues:</p>  <ul> <li>The link for Command Line Tool <a href="https://www.parse.com/apps/quickstart#hosting/windows" rel="nofollow">here </a>actually downloads <code>parse-windows-2.2.2.exe</code>, however description says that it is a <code>.zip</code> file which further contains two files so I think that is a glitch. (I managed to find the zip file somehow)</li> <li>When I create directory after executing <code>parse new [appname]</code> in command line, I am getting this error:</li> </ul>  <blockquote>   <p>Error talking to the Parse servers; please try again.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I found this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26618211/parse-cloud-code-deploy-error">Solution</a> but it's for Mac OSX.</p>
