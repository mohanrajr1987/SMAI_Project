<p>I have a table of Author and a table of Book. Each author has written multiple books. How do I create a query that returns the 25 authors with the latest books out, sorted by date. Here are my tables</p>  <pre><code>@ParseClassName(“Book”) Book{   String authorId;   String title;   Date date;   … }  @ParseClassName(“Author”) Author{   String name;   … } </code></pre>  <p>So I have reduced to problem to the authorIds, because once I get the authorIds, getting the Authors is easy enough. So rephrasing the problem: <strong>Write a query to: get the 25 authorIds with the latest books out, sorted by date</strong>. </p>  <p>Notice that I don’t want the 25 latest books, rather I want the 25 distinct authorIds associated with the latest books: Just the authorIds. Thanks for any help.</p>  <p>The answer may be in JavaScript for Parse Cloud Code or Java for android.</p>  <p><strong>HINT</strong></p>  <p>I am not completely sure, but I believe the sql equivalent would be</p>  <pre><code>SELECT DISTINCT(authorId) FROM book LIMIT 25 ORDER BY date DESCENDING </code></pre>
