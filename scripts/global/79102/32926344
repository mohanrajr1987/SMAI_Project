<p>All,</p>  <p>Does anyone have any hint on how to configure Atom.io to be more productive while coding Parse.com Cloud Code? And to use Parse.com in general. I have tried google it, with now tangible results.</p>  <p>How can I use auto-complete? Is there anyway i can test it locally without having to do "parse deploy"?</p>  <p>I have include the Parse.com JDK .js file on my Atom project - nothing is "coming" as suggestion from it.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance,</p>
