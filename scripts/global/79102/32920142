<p>I have two classes "Offers" and "Stores". The Offer class has a pointer field called "storeId" which points back to the "Stores" class. I need to query offers of a specific category, belonging to stores within a 20km radius of my current location. The returned store objects should then be displayed in a list view.</p>  <p>This is my code in the onCreate() method of my ParseQueryAdapter subclass. </p>  <pre><code>ParseQuery offersQuery = new ParseQuery("Offers"); offersQuery.whereEqualTo("category", category); ParseQuery storesQuery = new ParseQuery("Stores"); storesQuery.whereWithinKilometers("location",myLoc,20); storesQuery.whereMatchedKeyInQuery("objectId", "storeId", offersQuery); return storesQuery </code></pre>  <p>storesQuery is returning an empty list.</p>  <p>What am I missing? Also, please ignore ay typos in the above code</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
