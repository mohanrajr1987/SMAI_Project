<p>Here is my situation. Every user has a field called PrivateData, which is a pointer to a class called UserPrivateData containing a field called Locations. Here is what I do:</p>  <p>1- When I login, I fetch the PrivateData pointer object, like so:</p>  <pre><code>PFUser.currentUser()!["privateData"]!.fetch() </code></pre>  <p>2- When I get to another screen, I need to fetch the "Locations" from the "privateData", which is a UserPrivateData class in Parse.</p>  <pre><code>let locations = PFUser.currentUser()!["privateData"]!["locations"]! as! Array&lt;Dictionary&lt;String,AnyObject&gt;&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Everything works fine, I get what I need. However, when I change something and save it in Parse, I receive the Error 105 Invalid Field Name privateData.locations. However, it does save in Parse! The issue is that when I try to save another Object, with the PFUser.currentUser()!, it doesn't work. It calls the error.</p>  <p>Here is how I save a new address, and this is where I receive the error first:</p>  <pre><code>let query = PFQuery(className: "UserPrivateData")         query.getObjectInBackgroundWithId((PFUser.currentUser()!["privateData"]!.objectId!!),block: { (data , error) -&gt; Void in             if error != nil{                 print(error)             }else{                 if let data = data {                     data["locations"] = self.locations                     data.saveInBackground()                 }             }         }) </code></pre>  <p>When this executes, it does save in locations, but I receive the error. And then, when I try to save another object using PFUser.currentUser()!, I receive the same error and it doesn't save the said object.</p>  <p>Any idea?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>  <p>Charles</p>
