<p>I have the following line of code from  <code>swift 1.1</code>. </p>  <p>Now that I've upgraded (currently only to <code>swift 1.2</code>) I'm getting a <code>runtime error</code> on the following line:</p>  <pre><code>let myBool = parseObject["myBoolField"] as? Bool ?? false </code></pre>  <p>Has something changed with newer versions of Swift that change the way you use  in casts? </p>  <p>Shouldn't this line <strong>never fail</strong> and always at least resolve to <code>myBool = false</code> ? </p>
