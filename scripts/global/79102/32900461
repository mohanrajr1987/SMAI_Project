<p>I was having trouble wording the title, sorry.</p>  <p>Basically, I want to know the best practice when asking permissions from one user to another. An example would be those family tracker apps, where one user requests to follow another, and said user has to accept that request so the first user can follow their locations.</p>  <p>I am using Parse if that makes a difference. Thanks!</p>
