<p>I am trying to create a form with a multi-line TextBox with the following requirements:</p>  <ul> <li>The text in the text box might be short or long.</li> <li>There is not much space availble.</li> <li>I want to be sure that the entirety of the text has been seen.  I can't be sure that the user has actually read it, but I can at least require that all of it has been seen.</li> </ul>  <p>So I'm trying to make a "fully viewed" multi-line TextBox.</p>  <p>This picture should make it clear what I'm trying to do:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/neC1x.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/neC1x.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>If they check the checkbox before they've scrolled through the whole thing, I'll know not to believe them.</p>  <p>I think I need to know:</p>  <ul> <li>When the form comes up, was the text that was put into the TextBox short (all visible without scrolling) or long (the vertical scroll bar was shown)?</li> <li>If the vertical scroll bar is showing, has the user scrolled it all the way to the bottom?</li> </ul>  <p>Any ideas about how to achieve this?</p>
