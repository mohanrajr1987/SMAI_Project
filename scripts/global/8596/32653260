<p>I try to use zenity as a GUI for my bash script. At first step I want to show a user agreement which is quite long text but there is no scroll bar so the user could scroll down the text. </p>  <p>I use:</p>  <pre><code> LICENSE_TEXT=`cat license.txt` zenity --question --title "question dialog" --text="$LICENSE_TEXT" </code></pre>  <p>I have also tried:</p>  <pre><code> LICENSE_TEXT=`cat license.txt` zenity --question --title "question dialog" --filename=license.txt </code></pre>  <p>But it didn't make any difference</p>
