<p>The reason that I ask is that I want to be able to change the arrow colors to a gray / faded / disabled looking color if you can't actually scroll the content. I'm assuming I can use a DataTrigger on the element's property to change the colors based on whether or not the scrollbars are actually scrollable.</p>  <p>I apologize if this information is somewhere obvious. Perhaps I don't know how to word the search correctly.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/yAzp2.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/yAzp2.jpg" alt="No content"></a></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/eVwKN.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/eVwKN.jpg" alt="Scrollable content"></a></p>
