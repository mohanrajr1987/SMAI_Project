<p>I look at many projects on Github to learn through the examples, but one thing that confuses me is when you have a package that is multiple directories deep and has webpack.config.js files in multiple levels of the directory tree.</p>  <p>From my understanding webpack is bundling up all the js code and making it watchable. I don't understand how multiple bundlings would work out.</p>  <p>For example <a href="https://github.com/ojame/react-scrollbars" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/ojame/react-scrollbars</a></p>  <p>On the top level you have a package.json and a webpack.config.js(So I think oh this is where I run npm install and then webpack)</p>  <p>But I want to see the examples in the "examples" directory and there is another webpack.config.js, which is confusing to my webpack newbie brain.</p>  <p>What's up with this? Where do I do my bundling to check out this resource? Maybe using the example above would illustrate the solution well.</p>
