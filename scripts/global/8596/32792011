<p>I was trying to find a CSS only solution for styling scroll bars that appear in a div on a mobile device screen. I have seen that these scroll bars are styled unlike the ones on laptop screen. Since space on mobile screens is limited, it would be nice to have the scroll bars thinner and of course good looking.</p>  <p>I did some research and found some jQuery plugins, some of which are not free and they are jQuery dependent. You can see this type of scroll bar at this link: <a href="http://areaaperta.com/nicescroll/demo.html" rel="nofollow">http://areaaperta.com/nicescroll/demo.html</a>. Just click on first div to see the special scroll bar.</p>  <p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>  <p>Is there a way in CSS to come up with a scroll bar designed for small mobile screens that will work across major mobile devices/browsers? I was wanting a jQuery independent way of doing this.  An example of such a scroll bar is as below.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/kxASm.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/kxASm.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
