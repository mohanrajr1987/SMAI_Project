<p>I have a GUI. it contains a JTable. While performing some operation on that GUI ( eg: just clicking a button) that table will updated from DB. When additional raw added, automatically horizontal scroll panel created. I can view the newly added raws only with the help of that scroll bar. I don't need scroll bar. I want to see entire data of the table with out any scroll bar.... Anyone know the way, please help </p>
