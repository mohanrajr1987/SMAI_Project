<p>I am having a problem attempting to customise the stylesheet for my QScrollBars.</p>  <p>I have added images in the stylesheet for the handle, add-line and sub-line. However when i move the handle it is hiding the add-line/sub-line images and is creating a shadow at either end. I have set the background colour as green to emphasise the problem.</p>  <p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/oRl1F/all" rel="nofollow" title="Gallery containing three QScrollBar images">Gallery containing three QScrollBar images</a></p>  <p>The left most image shows the scroll bar as you would expect, however the images are then covered as the scroll bar is moved.</p>  <p>This is my style sheet:</p>  <pre><code>    QScrollBar{     background-color: rgb(108, 225, 12); width: 16px; margin: 0; }   QScrollBar::handle:vertical{     background-image: url(:/bar-handle.png); margin: 16 0 16 0;   }  QScrollBar::add-line{      background-image: url(:/bbottom); height: 16px;  subcontrol-position:bottom;     subcontrol-origin: margin;  }  QScrollBar::sub-line{      image: url(:/bar-end.png); height: 16px;  subcontrol-position: top;     subcontrol-origin: margin; } </code></pre>  <p>Thank you very much for any of your help,</p>  <p>Mat</p>
