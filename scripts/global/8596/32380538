<p>I am using winforms with c# and looking at the TableLayoutPanel</p>  <p>Is it possible to have a scroll bar on a large table, but not to have the top row scroll? It would be similar to how the "freeze panes" option works in Excel.</p>  <p>I only want to freeze the top row and nothing else. Also, my table is large enough that I will have a horizontal scroll bar as well. So when I scroll horizontally, I need both the top row and the rest of the rows to move at the same time and the same rate.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
