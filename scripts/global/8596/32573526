<p>So basically what I wish to accomplish is that I set total of Pictureboxes to add and each picturebox has its own according label and if we reach 6 images we allow the scrollbar to go down.</p>  <p><strong>Example:</strong> <a href="http://i.imgur.com/5xWu5Y1.png" rel="nofollow">http://i.imgur.com/5xWu5Y1.png</a></p>  <p>As you can see pictures are added accordingly with label. How can I do this in code?</p>  <p>Currently I got something like this:</p>  <pre><code>' Total PictureBoxes/Labels to Generate Dim wTotalPictures = 1  ' Original PictureBox Starting Point Dim wOriginalLocation = New System.Drawing.Point(40, 54)  ' Assigned Label Title Dim wImageTitle As String = "PictureTitle"  Dim wNewImage As New PictureBox Dim wImageSize = New Size(122, 173)  With wNewImage     .SizeMode = PictureBoxSizeMode.StretchImage     .Image = Image.FromFile("C:\Users\Jason\Pictures\newImage.jpg")     .Location = wOriginalLocation     .Size = wImageSize End With </code></pre>  <p>So any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>  <p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>  <p>I've now managed to change it into this, this works way better but still not 100% automatic like I want it. </p>  <pre><code>' Total PictureBoxes/Labels to Generate     Dim i As Integer = 0     Dim wTotalPictures = 5      ' Original PictureBox Starting Point     Dim wOriginalLocation = New System.Drawing.Point(40, 54)      ' Assigned Label Title     Dim wImageTitle As String = "PictureTitle"     Dim wImageSize = New Size(122, 173)      Dim wNewLocation As Integer = 0      Do Until i = wTotalPictures          ' Setup         Dim wNewImage(i) As PictureBox         wNewImage(i) = New PictureBox          ' Execute         wNewImage(i).SizeMode = PictureBoxSizeMode.StretchImage         wNewImage(i).Image = Image.FromFile("C:\Users\Jason\Pictures\newImage.jpg")         wNewImage(i).Size = wImageSize          If wNewLocation &lt; 480 Then             wNewImage(i).Location = New System.Drawing.Point(40 + wNewLocation, 54)         ElseIf wNewLocation = 480 Then             wNewImage(i).Location = New System.Drawing.Point(40, 258)             wNewLocation = 0         End If          ' Add to Form         MyTab.Controls.Add(wNewImage(i))         wNewImage(i).BringToFront()          wNewLocation = wNewLocation + 160         i += 1     Loop </code></pre>  <p>Please help, thanks!</p>
