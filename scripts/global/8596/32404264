<p>so I have a tab control in my c# program that's going to be getting a lot of information from a user. this is in the form of like 40 checkboxes/textboxes. I'm trying to figure out how in the designer to add a scroll bar ahead of time so I can have the form be a nice 800x500 but allow the user to scroll threw all the boxes and fill them up. idk if this is possible in the designer, or if I need to add them in through code with like a loop or something and then have autoscrollbar on so it works that way. Any ideas?</p>
