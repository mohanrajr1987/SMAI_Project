<p>I am trying to implement a wide Chart using the Oxyplot in silverlight. I am stuck on couple of items. Could anyone help me here.</p>  <p>1) How can I implement horizontal and vertical scrollbars in Oxyplot chart in silverlight? Objo suggest to follow the overlay sample. But a bit more information about that will be more helpful.</p>  <p>2) How to disable auto shrinking up of items when there are lot of items in the linear axis, butstill the zooming should works. The vertical scrollbar should help to see items below.</p>
