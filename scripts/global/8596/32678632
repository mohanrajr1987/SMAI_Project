<h2>Background</h2>  <p>I've made a library that shows a fast-scroller for RecyclerView (<a href="https://github.com/AndroidDeveloperLB/LollipopContactsRecyclerViewFastScroller" rel="nofollow"><strong>here</strong></a>, in case anyone wants), and I want to decide when to show and when to hide the fast-scroller.</p>  <p>I think a nice decision would be that if there are items that aren't shown on the screen (or there are a lot of them that do not appear), after the RecyclerView finished its layout process, I would set the fast-scroller to be visible, and if all items are already shown, there is no need for it to be shown.</p>  <h2>The problem</h2>  <p>I can't find a listener/callback for the RecyclerView, to tell me when it has finished showing items, so that I could check how many items are shown compared to the items count.</p>  <p>The recyclerView might also change its size when the keyboard appears and hides itself.</p>  <h2>What I've tried</h2>  <p>The scrolling listener will probably not help, as it occurs "all the time", and I just need to check only when the RecyclerView has changed its size or when the items count (or data) has changed.</p>  <p>I could wrap the RecyclerView with a layout that notifies me of size changes, like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/25895869/878126">this one</a> that I've made, but I don't think it will work as the RecyclerView probably won't be ready yet to tell how many items are visible.</p>  <p>The way to check the number of items being shown might be used as such:</p>  <pre><code>    final LinearLayoutManager layoutManager = new LinearLayoutManager(getActivity(), LinearLayoutManager.VERTICAL, false);     mRecyclerView.setLayoutManager(layoutManager);     ...     Log.d("AppLog", "visible items count:" + (layoutManager.findLastVisibleItemPosition() -layoutManager.findFirstVisibleItemPosition()+1)); </code></pre>  <h2>The question</h2>  <p>How do I get notified when the recyclerView has finished showing its child views, so that I could decide based on what's currently shown, to show/hide the fast-scroller ? </p>
