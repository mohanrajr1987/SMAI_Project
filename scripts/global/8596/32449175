<p>i try to display something like what is done on some famous sites: to display a picture + comment text in an overlaying div, so when i do this i like to disable scrolling for the rest of the body , and the window scrollbars adjust to allow me only to scroll in the overlaying div. i have all the page content in a div called id = bodyDiv, so a bad solution could be to set the height of the bodyDiv to "100%" and appending the overlaying div directly under body. the problem with this is when i scroll the content of my page to a certain position and then want to show an image in the overlaying div bodyDiv scrolls back to the original position scroll = 0;</p>  <p>Can you please give me a js, css based solution for that thank you very much in advance</p>  <p>i have not initial code to treat this problem. the concept can be clear if we see a facebook publication for example, when we click on a picture we get a floating "div" (i suppose) on which the picture (in bigger size) is on the left and comment on right, the browser scroll bars adapt to allow only scrolling inside that div, once we close the publication (that div) the scroll bar returns as it was before (same position too) this is what i want to achieve</p>  <p>i can achieve partly to adapt scroll bar to the div to the overlaying div this way:</p>  <pre><code>document.getElementById("bodyDiv").style.overflow = "hidden"; document.getElementById("bodyDiv").style.height = "100%"; </code></pre>  <p>and then return to normal scroll :</p>  <pre><code>    document.getElementById("bodyDiv").style.height = "auto";     document.getElementById("bodyDiv").style.overflow = "auto"; </code></pre>  <p>but after closing the publication the body (normal) scroll return to 0 i want to keep the scroll where i left it before viewing the page</p>
