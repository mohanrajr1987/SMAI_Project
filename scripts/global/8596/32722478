<p>if there was a blog with a border around it (e.g. 30px each length ~ ref.: themesbyunlure.tumblr.com/post/91567944508/add-border-around-blog) and then, there's a sidebar that should be to the left of that border like in this theme: <a href="http://neothm.com/08/2" rel="nofollow">http://neothm.com/08/2</a> or this one: <a href="http://shythemes.tumblr.com/13a" rel="nofollow">http://shythemes.tumblr.com/13a</a> - i was wondering how you can move the scrollbar? is there a script or something like that?</p>
