<p>I would like to know, if there is a common desision for issue described below.</p>  <p>Let's consider the situation: I have a form with some controls, which captions and fonts could be changed on loading. I want controls to be resized when form is resizing. Also I want control's captions to be clearly visible, if it possible. If it not, I want form to have scrollbar.</p>  <p>I thought I could use control constraints and anchors to resolve the situation. But if i use anchors scrollbar won't be shown. Also I have to calculate constraints because i don't know controls' fonts and captions' at design mode.</p>  <p>So I'm looking for some component or well-known algorithm which could help me to resolve the issue.</p>
