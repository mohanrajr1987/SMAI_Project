<p>I've got a file which I want to separate between an image at the top of the page and rows of data relating to the image which form the detail of the page. I want the user to be able to scroll down the data whilst simultaneously viewing the image. </p>  <p>Unfortunately simple scrolling on the page won't work because there are in fact two unjoined tables side by side making up the detail and when I put a simple scrollbar only one table scrolls at a time.</p>  <p>To get round this problem I thought of having the detail as an php include file, and tried to place the file between iframe tags as one would with an html file which should allow the whole include file to be scrolled.</p>  <p>I was able to do the following with an html file but found that I could not change the code to accomodate a php file. Anyone any suggestions, gratefully received.</p>  <p>main body of code for image file followed by the following which inserts a html file which I can scroll</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div style="position:absolute; left:200px; top:920px; width:500px; height:37px;"&gt;     &lt;?php     $iframe_doc = '/entry_forms.html';     ?&gt;     &lt;iframe src="&lt;?php echo $iframe_doc; ?&gt;" width="1500" height="200" scrolling="yes"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I would like to have simply inserted a similar file called <code>entry_forms.php</code> where it says <code>entry_forms.html</code> and substitute echo for include but the output only includes the html portion of the file and not the data, if that makes sense.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
