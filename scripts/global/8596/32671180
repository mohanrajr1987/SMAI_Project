<p>I am using <strong>Overthrow</strong> to safely use CSS overflow in a <strong>cordova mobile app</strong> for momentum scrolling. </p>  <p>I have an absolute positioned div with the following styles:</p>  <pre><code>.scrollable{   position: absolute;   top: 25px;   bottom: 10px;   left: 0;   right: 0; }  .overthrow-enabled .overthrow {   overflow: auto;   -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch; } </code></pre>  <p>On <strong>iOS</strong> momentum scrolling works great but the scrollbar doesn't show.</p>  <p>I don't think it depends on Overthrow, could it be a CSS problem? Can anyone help?</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
