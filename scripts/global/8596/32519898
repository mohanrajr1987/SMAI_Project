<p>I have made an Excel report (in Excel 2013) having a scroll bar to showcase all the data. I have also created a 'named item' to display the desired area. The named item includes the scroll bar. I have displayed the Excel workbook on a SharePoint 2013 site using a 'Excel web access webpart'. The Excel report gets displayed but without the scroll bar.  </p>  <p>How is the scroll bar not visible ?</p>
