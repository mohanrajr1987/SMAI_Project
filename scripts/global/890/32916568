<p>I have a java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError problem in the following scenario.<br> I designed a web project with JSF and Guice with separated layers. The layers are java libraries that are used in a DependencyResolver layer(library too) that will be used by the web layer.<br> WebProject(JSF + Guice)<br> Domain(library with models, Repository interfaces and Service interfaces)<br> Business(library)<br> Infrastructure(library)<br> DependencyResolver(library)<br> In webLayer I just use Domain and DependencyResolver.<br> In DependencyResolver I use Business, Infrastructure and Domain layers and a class that binds the Interfaces with classes(Guice).<br> If, in webLayer, I add the libraries Business and Infrastructure, the project runs fine, but I want that webLayer do not have that dependency, so, removing this two libraries from project shows java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError for classes in Business and Infrastructure.<br> Is there any way to DependencyResolver(Guice) can deliver the classes implemented without WebProject references to libraries Business and Infrastructure?<br> Thanks!</p>
