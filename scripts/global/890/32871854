<p>I have a system today in JSF + Primefaces and jdbc connection to Postgres, making selects and transactions with bank using ResultSet and PreparedStatement and would like to start working with Hibernate when I started the project had no tool of knowledge and I opted not to use .</p>  <p>From what I read in recent days about Hibernate, it all starts SessionFactory where the persistence occurs in the mappings and sessions and consultations / selects through mappings and Criteria education, createQuery, Repository.</p>  <p>I wonder if there is any example / cool stuff about JSF and Hibernate and how best to make the consultations is using Criteria, createQuery, Repository?</p>  <p>Any tip is welcome!</p>
