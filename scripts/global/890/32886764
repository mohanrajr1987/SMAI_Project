<p>does anybody know how to use RequestScoped bean together with rendered attribute in jsf? The rendered attribute is evaluated before applyValues phase and therefore is not correctly evaluated. I don't want to preserve any state. The example could be an outputPanel with a datatable and a button. The datatable gets a list of values. The wrapping outputPanel has the rendered attribute like:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;p:outputPanel rendered="#{not empty requestScopedBean.dataList}"&gt;     &lt;p:datatable value="#{requestScopedBean.dataList}"&gt;         ...     &lt;/p:datatable&gt;      &lt;p:commandButton action="#{requestScopedBean.someAction}" /&gt; &lt;/p:outputPanel&gt; </code></pre>  <p>After loading the page and clicking on the button, nothing happens, because the view is restored and expressions are evaluated - the bean does have an empty datalist and therefore the panel should not be rendered. This causes that the action method is not even called - because the button doesn't exist.</p>
