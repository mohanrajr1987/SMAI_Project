<p>Generally we used <code>&lt;h:outputScript /&gt;</code> to refer local scripts and for refering external Java Script we used <code>&lt;script src="http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.9.0/jquery-ui.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>.</p>  <p>Now my issue is how to refer those java script which dynamically loading through some other url for my case i have to refer this javascript <code>http://150.190.135.41:8700/iportal/jsapi</code> for the time being i am using like this </p>  <pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"                 src="http://150.190.135.41:8700/iportal/jsapi" /&gt; </code></pre>  <p>but for me its not a right approach it should be dynamic ,so i added this <code>http://150.190.135.41:8700/iportal/jsapi</code> to a properties file and now in jsf bean i initialize a variable with this url. </p>  <p>Now can any one tell me how to access it into XHTML of JSF Page? This dynamic access needed because ip of <strong>iportal</strong> would be different for different client.</p>
