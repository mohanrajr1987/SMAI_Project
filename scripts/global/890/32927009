<p>I know there is probably a more 'proper' terminology for this, however I do not know what that term might be.  I am trying to accomplish the following within my java dynamic web project.  I have a context root, for example:</p>  <p><a href="http://hostname:port/appContextRoot" rel="nofollow">http://hostname:port/appContextRoot</a></p>  <p>When the user navigates through the website, the user will see URLs changing according to which page of the website he/she is on such as:</p>  <ol> <li><a href="http://hostname:port/appContextRoot/welcome.xhtml" rel="nofollow">http://hostname:port/appContextRoot/welcome.xhtml</a></li> <li><a href="http://hostname:port/appContextRoot/page1.xhtml" rel="nofollow">http://hostname:port/appContextRoot/page1.xhtml</a></li> <li><a href="http://hostname:port/appContextRoot/logout.xhtml" rel="nofollow">http://hostname:port/appContextRoot/logout.xhtml</a></li> </ol>  <p>And so on.  I would like to know, how it is accomplished in Java using IBM websphere, to configure the application so that the only URL ever visible to the user is:</p>  <p><a href="http://hostname:port/appContextRoot" rel="nofollow">http://hostname:port/appContextRoot</a></p>  <p>I am using Java 7, JSF 2 and PrimeFaces 5</p>  <p>Edit - to be more clear about how i'd like to accomplish this i should say that id prefer "accomplishing this via a web-xml based or application server based policy. For example, there are ways of intercepting the http-request cycle in JSF using a filter. [...] more of a question to how i can accomplish this at a configuration level."</p>
