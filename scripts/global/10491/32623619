<p>I am trying to speed up my code. In development, everything ran very smooth, but once I put it in production, and started adding more depth of data into the database, I realize that it is running very slow.</p>  <p>I noticed on django-toolbar that it is running THOUSANDS of queries, where it should only be maybe 10-20. I am wondering if it may be because of the way I have a lot of content being delivered.</p>  <p>For example, I have code that looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>{% if user.profile.is_admin %}    ... {% endif %} </code></pre>  <p>and</p>  <pre><code>{% for stuff in user.profile.get_somestuff %}    ...    {{ stuff.info }}    {{ stuff.other_info }}    ... {% endfor %} </code></pre>  <p>Does each one of these execute a new query?</p>  <p>Should I run the query for <code>get_somestuff</code> in the view, pass it through context? I am asking from a performance perspective.</p>
