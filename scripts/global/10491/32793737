<p>I have a list being displayed in a template:</p>  <p>EDIT: this is more complete code from the template:</p>  <pre><code>{% for assertions in badge_assertions_by_type %}     {{assertions.badge_type.name}}           {% for assertion in assertions.list %}           {{assertion.badge.name}}           {{assertion.time_issued}}       {% endfor %}   {% endfor %} </code></pre>  <p>badge_assertions_by_type is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32420417/how-to-use-a-related-manager-and-reverse-lookups-to-clean-up-this-django-queryse/32420722">defined here</a>.</p>  <p><code>{{assertions.list}}</code> looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>[&lt;BadgeAssertion: MyBadge#1&gt;, &lt;BadgeAssertion: MyBadge#1&gt;, &lt;BadgeAssertion: MyBadge#1&gt;, &lt;BadgeAssertion: MyBadge#1&gt;, &lt;BadgeAssertion: MyBadge#2&gt;]  </code></pre>  <p>Instead of displaying all of these items, I only want to display unique items, with a number showing how many, e.g instead of:</p>  <pre><code>MyBadge#1 MyBadge#1 MyBadge#1 MyBadge#1 MyBadge#2 </code></pre>  <p>I want something like this, preferably done in the Template:</p>  <pre><code>MyBadge#1 (x4) MyBadge#2 </code></pre>  <p>The text being displayed is actually {{assertion.badge.name}}, which is the same as the BadgeAssertion model's <code>__str__</code> which is why it looks the same in {{assertions.list}}</p>  <p>assertions.list is coming from some other stuff higher up (see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32420417/how-to-use-a-related-manager-and-reverse-lookups-to-clean-up-this-django-queryse/32420722#32420722">here</a>, there it is confusingly called badges.list)</p>  <p>The models:</p>  <pre><code>class Badge(models.Model):     name = models.CharField(max_length=50, unique=True)     ...  class BadgeAssertion(models.Model):     badge = models.ForeignKey(Badge)     ... </code></pre>
