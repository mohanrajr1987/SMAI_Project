<p>I add field like  forms.ChoiceField(widget=forms.Select(choices=OPTIONS, initial=0) when display, the normal dropdown is replaced with one with a search box on item list, I think that is Django widget?</p>  <p>I had to add the style to set wdith, otherwise, the dropdown will show with width 33px, way too small</p>  <p>But then I need embed those dropdowns into a jquery accordion. I found dropdowns in non-active section will all have width set to 0px.  I guess widget set it to 0 after it detects them are hidden.</p>  <p>I am looking for a way to solve this, either make widget not set width that way, or remove widget effect at all.</p>  <p>Any idea?</p>  <p>thanks</p>
