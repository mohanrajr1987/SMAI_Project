<p>What is the most reusable way for the "extends" method in django templates?</p>  <p>I have seen this very often:</p>  <pre><code>{% extends 'base.html' %} </code></pre>  <p>Unfortunately this does not work for me. The ordering of the template loader loads a template from a different app first.</p>  <p>I have a default django project and application created from scratch with Django1.8.</p>  <p>What should I do:</p>  <ul> <li>use a different name like 'my_base.html'</li> <li>alter the ordering of the template loader</li> <li>other solution?</li> </ul>
