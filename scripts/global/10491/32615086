<p>I'm trying to create a form based on models like this:</p>  <pre><code># models.py  class Event(models.Model):    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)    guests = models.ManyToManyField('Guest', blank=True)  class Guest(models.Model):    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)    is_late = models.BooleanField(default=false) </code></pre>  <p>The form for Event that I imagine would be almost identical to the <code>TabularInline</code> option on admin</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/WZJSP.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/WZJSP.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I read about <code>Inline Formset</code>, but it seems that it's only designed to work with <code>ForeignKey</code> and not <code>ManyToManyField</code>. Has anybody gotten around that limitation? What would be the best way to create the form that would accomplish similar function? I'm tempted to just create HTML/CSS/JS interface for this and process the data in the view once it got submitted.</p>
