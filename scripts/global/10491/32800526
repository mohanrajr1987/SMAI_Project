<p>I need to execute a command on a simple button press event in my Django project (for which I'm using "subprocess.Popen()" in my views.py ). After I execute this script it may take anywhere from 2 minutes to 5 minutes to complete. So while the script executes I need to disable the html button but I want the users to continue using other web pages while the script finishes in the background. Now the real problem is that I want to enable the html button back, when the process finishes!  I'm stuck at this from many days. Any help or suggestion is really really appreciated.</p>
