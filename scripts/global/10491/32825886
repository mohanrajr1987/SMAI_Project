<p>I'm following the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/intro/tutorial02/" rel="nofollow">django tutorial</a>, and I don't understand why put the <code>templates</code> folder for the admin pages in the base directory, instead of having it in <code>mysite</code> directory. </p>  <p>In fact, when adding templates to the <code>polls</code> app, these were put in the <code>polls</code> directory.  Is there an underlying reason for this to happen?  Will I run into trouble if I change this configuration?  </p>
