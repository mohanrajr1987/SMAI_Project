<p>Is there a way in django to declare a custom template tag "on the fly"?</p>  <p>For example, if I have a page that renders an a tree structure and for my tag to work, it needs the root and the leaf. Since I now that I will use this tag <strong>only</strong> with this root (on the page), is there a way to create the template once I know which root will be used?</p>  <p>In my templates, I currently use:</p>  <pre><code>{% render_leaf root leaf %} </code></pre>  <p>I would like to create the tag "on the fly" (just after fetching the root), so that the root is now a local variable of the tag function, and I can simply call: <code>{% render_leaf leaf %}</code></p>
