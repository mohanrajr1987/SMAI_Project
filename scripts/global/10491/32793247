<p>I was wondering if I could use the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/contrib/staticfiles/#static" rel="nofollow">template tag static</a> in my javascript file to call a CSV file I want to pass to D3 like so:</p>  <pre><code>{% static "js/data.csv" %} </code></pre>  <p>I'd really like my JavaScript files to be separate from my HTML, because it can get long and messy. Thanks for any help. </p>
