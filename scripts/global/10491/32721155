<p>Is it possible to include a template (with <code>include</code> django template tag) within another template and "inject" some content to the page that includes (parent) through <code>block</code> tag, or something similar?</p>  <p>Let's say I have the following file structure within my project:</p>  <pre><code>App/     (...)     templates/         base.html         index.html         _include1.html         _include2.html         _include3.html         _include4.html </code></pre>  <p>Code for <code>base.html</code>:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head lang="en"&gt;     (...) &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;script type="application/javascript"&gt;     $(function () {         {% block extra_script %}         {% endblock %}     });  &lt;/script&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Code for <code>index.html</code>:</p>  <pre><code>{% extends "base.html" %} {% load static %} (...) &lt;div class="row gutter"&gt;     &lt;div&gt;         {% include "_include1.html" with object=object%}     &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;div&gt;         {% include "_include2.html" with object=object %}     &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;div&gt;         {% include "_include3.html" with object=object %}     &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;div&gt;         {% include "_include4.html" with object=object %}     &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>And in each <code>_include*.html</code> I would like to call some specific JS function (for example), but I want to place it in the parents (<code>index.html</code> or <code>base.html</code>, doesn't matter in my case) <code>extra_script</code> block. I searched in the documentation, other questions and didn't find a way to do this with the <code>include</code> syntax. </p>  <p>I've done something similar but through <code>extends</code> tag. However I don't want to define a block in the <code>index.html</code> or <code>base.html</code> for each page that I need to include (<code>{% bloc include_* %}</code>. </p>  <p>So the solution that I have now (and works) is to define a script in each included page like this (<code>_include1.html</code>):</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div&gt; (...) &lt;/div&gt; &lt;script&gt;     $(function () {         //Code that should be placed within parents script page (this is just an example)         var a = function (){                     (...)                 };         a();     }); &lt;/script&gt; </code></pre>  <p>However I think there's a better way to do this, by making use of django templates engine, and without having to define a block for each page that needs to be included. Also I would like to have all my js code in a single place (parents <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag) instead of being scattered all over the place (like it is with the presented solution).</p>  <p>Can anyone give some input or ideas towards this?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
