Right now the the left sidebar is from the header.php file there i have included the <code>&lt;?php echo do_shortcode('[ultimatemember form_id=94]'); ?&gt;</code>  to display the form.  On the Page, I have included the <code>[ultimatemember form_id=94]</code> to appear on the body.</p>  <p>1) I don't want the members area in the left bar <br> 2) I don't want the filter to appear in body.</p>  <p>When I search the filter in the left area, I need to display all users in right area. </p>
