<p>my problem seems to be the problem of a lot of others, but no amount of googling for the past 6 hours could lead me to a working solution for people who want to make Themes from Scratch. The solutions out there are mainly for people who want to get a specific plugin to work with an existing theme.</p>  <p>I am trying to learn making a WordPress Theme from Scratch, and I was able to put one together using the following Tutorial: <a href="http://www.onextrapixel.com/2011/03/08/how-to-code-a-wordpress-3-0-theme-from-scratch/" rel="nofollow">http://www.onextrapixel.com/2011/03/08/how-to-code-a-wordpress-3-0-theme-from-scratch/</a></p>  <p>It works great, but when I try to add a Slider using a Plugin, it won't slide.</p>  <p>Can anyone here help with some insight as to what I(And the tutorial) are missing so that the Sliders would work?</p>  <p>Please do not mind the placeholder images, they are not meant to infringe on the copyright of the artist. These were supposed to be the sliders but they won't slide.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/WuyKr.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/WuyKr.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
