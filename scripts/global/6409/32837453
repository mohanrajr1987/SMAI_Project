<p>I have this website created with wordpress on <a href="http://schoolcms.webfreaks.cu.cc/" rel="nofollow">http://schoolcms.webfreaks.cu.cc/</a> It is working perfectly fine on this host but when I try to transfer it any other other host (even localhost) it gives me layout issues like this: <a href="http://consciousnesstree.com/sharadashram/" rel="nofollow">http://consciousnesstree.com/sharadashram/</a> Am I doing something wrong or the website transfer creating some issues?</p>
