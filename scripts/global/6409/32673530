<p><a href="http://edtechtimes.com" rel="nofollow">Link</a></p>  <p>I am using a Wordpress theme called Anderson Lite and developing a child theme on top of it. I have enabled infinite scroll in my functions.php file (it doesn't automatically work with this specific theme). </p>  <p>The front page displays post excerpts and using the standard pagination all the pages also display post excerpts, but when using infinite scroll, full posts load after the first page rather than excerpts. I know this is a matter of finding some file in my theme and changing the_post to the_excerpt, but which one is it?</p>
