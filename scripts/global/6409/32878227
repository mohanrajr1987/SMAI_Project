<p>Hoping you can point out what I'm doing wrong. I have a widget area in my sidebar which is only to display for a section of my site.</p>  <pre><code>if(is_page(199) || $post-&gt;post_parent == '199') { dynamic_sidebar( 'widget-area' ); } </code></pre>  <p>What Im getting is the actual page and its children, This is good though I changed the structure of the section which created grandchildren, now the grandchildren won't display the widget area.</p>
