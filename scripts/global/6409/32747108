<p>I have a template which was drawn from abomb. It has a search, which works, but not in the way one would like it to work. We would like to see only results having a <code>post_type</code> of <code>'post'</code>, but we do not find the place where we could modify the search terms. I was able to find the query it generates:</p>  <pre><code>    SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS wp_posts.ID FROM wp_posts      LEFT JOIN wp_icl_translations t      ON wp_posts.ID = t.element_id AND t.element_type LIKE 'post\_%'      LEFT JOIN wp_icl_languages l      ON t.language_code=l.code AND l.active=1 WHERE 1=1 AND (((wp_posts.post_title LIKE '%bali%') OR (wp_posts.post_content LIKE '%bali%'))) AND (wp_posts.post_password = '') AND wp_posts.post_type IN ('post', 'page', 'attachment', 'image', 'product') AND (wp_posts.post_status = 'publish') AND (t.language_code='en' OR t.language_code IS NULL )      ORDER BY wp_posts.post_title LIKE '%bali%' DESC, wp_posts.post_date DESC      LIMIT 0, 10 </code></pre>  <p>I can tell that the problem is with <code>wp_posts.post_type IN ('post', 'page', 'attachment', 'image', 'product')</code>, however, I struggle in finding where were these terms applied. I have tried editing search.php of the template in admin panel. I have tried to search for some keyword, like <code>'attachment'</code>, but these were not successful. Does anybody have an idea about where should I look to find the place where 'post', 'page', 'attachment', 'image' and 'product' were added to the search so I can modify it?</p>  <p>EDIT:</p>  <p>I would like to modify the filters before <code>have_posts</code> is executed. </p>
