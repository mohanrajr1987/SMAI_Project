<p>I'm designing and developing some blog on Wordpress, and I'm creating dedicated template.</p>  <p>My goal is to load different header for new session (let's say it is some kind of splashscreen) and different (normal) for every next request from the same machine (untill session downs).</p>  <p>For example: I have two PHP files: header-init.php and header.php and I want to make if statement with this two files.</p>  <p>How can I achieve that? Can I use WordPress build in session or am I need someting else?</p>
