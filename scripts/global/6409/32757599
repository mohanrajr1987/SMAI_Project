<p>total wordpress beginner here. I purchased a organicfood theme and when I got an updated version for it, among other files I also found organicfood child theme zip in main directory. </p>  <p>I know that organicfood.zip contains the updated version of parent theme but I don't know if same goes for organicfood child theme zip. Is the child zip added with every update just so that a new buyer has that default child theme template? </p>
