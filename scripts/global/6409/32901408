<p>What is the best way to override the <strong>woocomerce</strong> function that is in defined in the <strong>woocomerce</strong> plugins directory inside some class. For example I am wanted to change the function <code>start_el</code> declared in the class <code>WC_Product_Cat_List_Walker</code>. I can change the function code in the plugin directory by the changes remains until I upgrade the <strong>woocomerce</strong> plugin. How can I override it in my theme <code>functions.php</code> file?</p>
