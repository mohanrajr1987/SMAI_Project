<p>I am trying to port my current site to woocommerce.  I currently have a simple category page that lists all the products in that category with variation selection and allows Add To Cart without having to go to the detail page.</p>  <p>Example: <a href="http://peerlessrattan.com/fibre-rush.html" rel="nofollow">http://peerlessrattan.com/fibre-rush.html</a></p>  <p>Essentially I want to be able to select a product or product variation option and add to cart.  Must be a way to do it but I can't find any shortcodes, code or plugins to do this?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
