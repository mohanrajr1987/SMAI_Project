<p>While bloggers may know about gravatar and have an account, there are other users who donâ€™t have a personal gravatar, so when they post a comment on a blog, a mystery man takes over their gravatar.</p>  <p>I want to put my own Avatar there. I don't want to use Mystery Person and all. I have own Avtar placed in <strong>[img]</strong> folder in my theme directory. Named as <strong>admin.jpg</strong> I want to use this as default Avtar and want this to placed in <strong>WordPress Dashboard->Settings->Discussion</strong>.</p>  <p><strong>For this I have used hooks. I placed some code in my functions.php. Code is as below:</strong></p>  <pre><code>add_filter( 'avatar_defaults', 'ownavatar' );  function ownavatar ($avatar_defaults) { $myavatar = get_bloginfo('template_directory') . '/img/admin.jpg'; $avatar_defaults[$myavatar] = "Navnish's Avtar"; return $avatar_defaults; } </code></pre>  <p><strong>Issue:</strong></p>  <p>When I went into [Discussion] sections. Its not displaying image there. Not even displaying that on comments. </p>  <p><strong>How its reverting is as below:</strong> <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/0W8sB.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/0W8sB.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Am I doing something wrong? Help would be appreciated. </p>
