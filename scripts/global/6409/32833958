<p>If possible, how can you track different page templates / theme files individually in google analytics?</p>  <p>For example in wordpress you have these theme files:</p>  <pre><code>single.php category.php custom-post-type.php  page.php </code></pre>  <p>How to track the performance of all page views that are shared by the same theme file? Say you have 100 pages that use single.php you want to see the average performance of that template instead of the individual page performances.</p>
