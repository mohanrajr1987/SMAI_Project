<p>I have horoscope post type, where I have 4 categories (yearly, monthly, lovely and weekly horoscope) every post have 12 editors - 12 signs. I need that URL structure:</p>  <ol> <li>In Yearly I need this url: <a href="http://domain.com/post-type/taxonomy/year" rel="nofollow">http://domain.com/post-type/taxonomy/year</a></li> <li>In Monthly I need this url: <a href="http://domain.com/post-type/taxonomy/month/year" rel="nofollow">http://domain.com/post-type/taxonomy/month/year</a></li> <li>In Lovely I need this url: <a href="http://domain.com/post-type/taxonomy/month/year" rel="nofollow">http://domain.com/post-type/taxonomy/month/year</a></li> <li>In Weekly I need this url: <a href="http://domain.com/post-type/taxonomy" rel="nofollow">http://domain.com/post-type/taxonomy</a></li> </ol>  <p>In Yearly I have many years, in monthly and lovely I have many years and many month, in weekly just on page that edit every week.</p>  <p>At first I think that "taxonomy" - it will be parent category of taxonomy, "month" - it will be child category of taxonomy and "year" - it will be post. But when create in on taxonomy the same name of category their slug became "month-1, month-2" and the same when I create the same post name in post type. So this solution doesn't work.</p>  <p>Now I want to create 4 post type and in each post type rewrite url, like that:</p>  <ol> <li>In Yearly I need that in url show: <a href="http://domain.com/horoscope/post-type/year-of-post" rel="nofollow">http://domain.com/horoscope/post-type/year-of-post</a> create and no slug of post</li> <li>In Monthly and Lovely I need that in url show: <a href="http://domain.com/horoscope/post-type/month-of-post-create/year-of-post-create/" rel="nofollow">http://domain.com/horoscope/post-type/month-of-post-create/year-of-post-create/</a> and no slug of post</li> <li>In weekly just: <a href="http://domain.com/horoscope/weekly/" rel="nofollow">http://domain.com/horoscope/weekly/</a></li> </ol>
