<p>I'm struggling to remove a slash of a menu in Wordpress.</p>  <p>I'm editing <a href="http://www.videoramatv.com/" rel="nofollow">this page</a>. The theme used is awaken. And I'm not sure if that "/" which is between each of the elements of the menu comes for something on the theme being used, or if it's something that wordpress does by default.</p>  <p>I was checking the html generated and I couldnt see the character physically in the code.</p>  <p>Any help?</p>
