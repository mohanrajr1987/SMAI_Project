<p>I have <code>Player</code> and <code>CharacterSpawner</code> which takes <code>IPlayer</code> in its constructor. </p>  <pre><code>    class CharacterSpawner : ICharacterSpawner     {         public CharacterSpawner(IPlayer player, SomeDep dep)         {             // ...         }          public void SpawnNext()         {             // ...         }     } </code></pre>  <p>In some parts of my app I want to Resolve <code>ICharacterSpawner</code> for particular <code>IPlayer</code>.  I want to cache <code>ICharacterSpawner</code> instances so that only one is created per <code>IPlayer</code>. How can I do that with Autofac?</p>  <p><strong>update</strong> Suggested existing answer is not about AutoFac but about Castle instead. I need to use Autofac for my project.</p>
