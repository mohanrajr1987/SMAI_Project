<p>I've been reading through the Docker documentation and can't seem to work out if its possible to create a custom command/directive. Basically I need to make an HTTP request to external service to retrieve some assets that need to be included within my container. Rather than referencing them using Volumes I want to effectively inject them into the container during the build process, a bit like dependancy injection.</p>
