<p>I want to dependency inject the CloudBlobContainer instance "container" into my custom class.</p>  <p>The question is the lifetime. I could do for Per Web Request or As a singleton because that client will never change when the application runs.</p>  <p>My question is should I expect problems because the blobClient keeps a kind of open connection?</p>  <pre><code>CloudStorageAccount storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.Parse( ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["MyDataStorageConnectionString"] );  CloudBlobClient blobClient = storageAccount.CreateCloudBlobClient(); CloudBlobContainer container = blobClient.GetContainerReference("mydata"); </code></pre>
