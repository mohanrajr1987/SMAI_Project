<p>I am trying to understand dependency injection in PHP and I see there are two ways to do this in Laravel.</p>  <p>So let us say I have a class <code>Foo</code> like so:</p>  <pre><code>class Foo{  } </code></pre>  <p>Now I have a class called <code>Bar</code> which is dependent on <code>Foo</code> so I could do something like:</p>  <pre><code>class Bar{     protected $foo;     public function __construct()     {         $this-&gt;foo = new Foo();     } } </code></pre>  <p>But in Laravel, I have come across terms like typehinting and reflection which allow me to do this:</p>  <pre><code>class Bar{     protected $foo;     public function __construct(Foo $foo)     {         $this-&gt;foo = $foo;     } } </code></pre>  <p>What I am trying to understand is the difference between these two. Are they totally identical? And is there a specific reason I should prefer on over the other?</p>  <p>PS: I am newbie and I am not sure if I am using the jargon in the question correctly.</p>
