<p>I have a GUI set up:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/lmObc.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/lmObc.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I'm trying to set all of the components inside of the "text" JPanel to not be enabled. I was wondering what happens if I call</p>  <pre><code>for(Component component : plantBox.getParent().getComponents()){     component.setEnabled(false); } </code></pre>  <p>Would this call the component's (the little box that says "plant") parent (the JLabel that says "text", and then retrieve all of the "text" JLabel's components ("Plant", "Status", "Stage" boxes) and set their enable-ability to false?</p>
