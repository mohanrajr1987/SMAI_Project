<p>My problem is similar to this: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7236551/nested-jpanel-with-gridbaglayout">Nested JPanel with GridBagLayout</a>.</p>  <p>Basically, when a <code>JPanel</code> is nested into a <code>JPanel</code> in a frame using <code>GridBagLayout</code>, the weight of the <code>GridBagLayout</code> changes automatically. Is there a way to fix the weight of <code>GridBagLayout</code> so that it does not change no matter what is nested into it? </p>
