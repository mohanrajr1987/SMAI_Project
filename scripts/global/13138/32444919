<p>Good day,</p>  <p>I might've been a bit vague with the title of my question, but I hope this will explain. The scenario is quite basic - I have a JFrame, in which I have an array of JPlanes. The idea is that when I click on one of them, upon clicking in should become black. Here is the code:</p>  <pre><code>import java.awt.*; import java.awt.event.ActionEvent; import java.awt.event.ActionListener; import java.awt.event.MouseAdapter; import java.awt.event.MouseEvent; import java.awt.event.MouseListener;  import javax.swing.*; import javax.swing.border.Border;  public class PixelArt {      JFrame frame;     Border blackline;     JPanel squares[][] = new JPanel[100][100];     int x;     int y;      public PixelArt() {          frame = new JFrame("Pixel Art");         frame.setSize(1000, 1000);         frame.setLayout(new GridLayout(100, 100));         frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);          for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++) {             for (int j = 0; j &lt; 100; j++) {                 x = i;                 y = j;                 squares[i][j] = new JPanel();                 squares[i][j].setBorder(BorderFactory.createDashedBorder(null));                 squares[i][j].addMouseListener(new MouseAdapter() {                      public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent e) {                          x = e.getX();                         y = e.getY();                         squares[x][y].setBackground(Color.black);                       }                 });                  frame.add(squares[i][j]);             }         }          frame.setVisible(true);     }      public static void main(String[] args) {         new PixelArt();     } } </code></pre>  <p>The actual problem is that this code does not do what I explained above. It does color in one of the JPlane's black when clicked, but within a <em>9x9 area starting from the upper corner of the grid</em>. I do not have an explanation for this. The problem seems to be in the following 2 lines:</p>  <pre><code>    x = e.getX();     y = e.getY(); </code></pre>  <p>One of my guesses is that I have some kind of an offset in the coordinate system, but then this does not explain why regardless on which JPanel I press, the JPanels colored are only in the upper 9x9 area.</p>  <p>Does anyone have a clue how I could fix the problem I described above? If something is unclear in my explanation, please ask. Thank you in advance. </p>  <p>Here is a screenshot of the working code:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/3dKxM.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/3dKxM.png" alt="Screenshot of working code"></a></p>
