<p>I have three panels inside one panel(which is inside JFrame).In the middle panel there are some 30 JButtons.Now I want to add JButton dynamically inside the middle panel on click of a leftmost panel JButton.I am doing following</p>  <pre><code>imagePanel.add(newBtn); imagePanel.revalidate(); outermostPanel.revalidate(); </code></pre>  <p>But,on doing this nothing happens.I don't want to use repaint as I will re-draw the complete middle panel and I am only left the new JButton,the previously added 30 JButtons are gone.</p>
