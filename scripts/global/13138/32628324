<p>We have a Swing application with a lot of input dialogs featuring okay and cancel buttons.</p>  <p>I've noticed that in JOptionPane the order of the okay and cancel buttons changes depending on platform. On Windows it's okay/cancel and on Unix it's cancel/okay.</p>  <p>Where we've added our own okay and cancel buttons I'd like the order of them to match the order they show in JOptionPane for consistency.</p>  <p>I was wondering if there's a way to interrogate the UIManager to find out what the correct order should be for the current look and feel or platform.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.
