<p>as the title says, I would like to add a JLabel to a class (in my case, named GamePanel) which extends JPanel. I tried with</p>  <pre><code>    public class GamePanel extends JPanel implements Runnable, KeyListener     {  /*Some of my instructions * */        public void gamelabel()        {              JLabel mylabel = new JLabel();              mylabel.setBounds(0, 0, 1280, 720);              GamePanel.add(mylabel);    //Here I'm getting an error message        }  /*Others instructions * */     } </code></pre>  <p>So I really don't know how to do it, but I have the feeling it must be an easy solution... Nevertheless, I couldn't find it.</p>  <p>How could I do it? Thanks in advance.</p>
