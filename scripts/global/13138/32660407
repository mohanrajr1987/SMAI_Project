<p>I'm new with Java and I'm trying to a class that extends JPanel. I have a updateView() method that is suppose to draw rounded rectangles with text in the middle inside the JPanel. Also, I would need to stock the textfield and the rounded rectangle in a LinkedHashMap. I already got a var for this, I just don't know witch type of var I need to use.</p>  <p>I'have been searching the solution for a while, and all the answers I found are either to complicated for me to understand or just doesn't apply to my case.</p>  <p>I know that it's almost nothing, but here is what I got so far...</p>  <pre><code>package game;  import javax.swing.JPanel;  public class GameNumView extends JPanel {      private Map&lt;Integer,Integer&gt; backgroundText = new LinkedHashMap&lt;"My rounded rectangle","My textfield"&gt;();      public GameNumView()     {      }      public void UpdateView(String[] pNumbers)     {         //Create the background          //Create the text      }    } </code></pre>
