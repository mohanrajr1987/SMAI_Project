<p>Continuing on from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32848552/combining-mouselisteners-with-polygons-in-graphics2d/32849494#32849494">this question</a>, I'm implementing a <code>MouseMotionListener</code> in my <code>JPanel</code> so that I can track mouse events to pass down to the objects contained within.</p>  <p>This didn't work, so I implemented a completely clean <code>JPanel</code> (that has none of the other stuff my game panel has) with a <code>MouseMotionListener</code> and that still didn't work. It's just set up in a very simple <code>JFrame</code> with a <code>FlowLayout</code>.</p>  <p>Am I using it wrong? How am I meant to trigger the mouse events?</p>  <p><code>JPanelMouseMotion</code> class:</p>  <pre><code>import java.awt.event.MouseEvent; import java.awt.event.MouseMotionListener;  import javax.swing.JPanel;  public class JPanelMouseMotion extends JPanel implements MouseMotionListener {      private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;      public JPanelMouseMotion() {         super();     }      @Override     public void mouseDragged(MouseEvent e) {     }      @Override     public void mouseMoved(MouseEvent e) {         System.out.println(e.getX() + " / " + e.getY());     }  } </code></pre>
