<p>I am using python for Machine Learning question. The data I have is as follows in format of csv with each line having a format: <code>&lt;class-label&gt;, feature_1, feature_2,....</code></p>  <p>An example would be:</p>  <pre><code>1,0,0,3,4,5 3,0,0,9,0,0 5,0,0,2,2,2 1,0,1,5,0,0 5,0,1,3,0,0 5,1,0,0,4,0 </code></pre>  <p>I need to split the data based on fist column. In the given case, I should have a dictionary having 3 entries with each having a value to a matrix of features. Of course, I can iterate through, but I am looking for more of a one-liner to do this.</p>  <p>EDIT: So the answer should look something like this:</p>  <pre><code>1 =&gt; [ [0,0,3,4,5],        [0,1,5,0,0]] 3 =&gt; [ [0,0,9,0,0]] 5 =&gt; [ [0,0,2,2,2],        [0,1,3,0,0],        [1,0,0,4,0]] </code></pre>
