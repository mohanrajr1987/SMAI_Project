<p>Suppose I have an array of numbers and I want to create a new array that is the difference between consecutive elements. (I hope this answer to this question is generalized to other functions besides differencing!)</p>  <p>Is there a concise way to do this? Solutions for both regular Python implentations and Numpy/Pandas powered implentations would be appreciated! </p>  <p>The not-so-concise way: </p>  <pre><code>for index in range(len(array)):     if index &lt; len(array) - 1:         differences.append(array[index+1]-array[index]) </code></pre>
