<pre><code>import numpy as np N = 100 Y = np.linspace(0,100,num = N) X = range(N) </code></pre>  <p>I know how to calculate slope for a line manually: <code>y = m*x + b</code> and <code>m = (y_2 - y_1)/(x_2 - x_1)</code> but <strong>is there a built-in function that can do this for the <code>np.linspace</code> array?</strong> </p>  <p>Maybe something that <code>scipy</code> has or some other module in the Scientific packages? </p>
