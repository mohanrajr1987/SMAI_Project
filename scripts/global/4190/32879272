<p>I have a pandas dataframe column which is a series. The column contains elements which are list of strings. However this column is basically an array_agg of postgressql , so each element is a list but something like this: </p>  <pre><code>&lt;type 'list'&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Here is how first two elements of this column(Series) look</p>  <pre><code>0    [UMIN Clinical Trial Registry [Website Last up... 1    [Disposition of Patients \n\nSTARTED; Tetracai... Name: notes, dtype: object </code></pre>  <p>When I do column[0] I get this: </p>  <pre><code>['UMIN Clinical Trial Registry [Website Last updated date: May 26, 2011] \n\nRecruitment status: Not yet recruiting \n\nDate of protocol fixation: 02/01/2011 \n\nAnticipated trial start date: 07/01/2011 \n\nName of primary sponsor: The Second Department of Internal Medicine Tokyo Medical University \n\nSource of funding: OMRON Health Care corporation \n\nhttps://upload.umin.ac.jp/cgi-open-bin/ctr/ctr.cgi?function=brows&amp;action=brows&amp;type=summary&amp;recptno=R000006682&amp;language=E', 'The projected start date 07/01/2011 was removed because that date passed without evidence of trial start.\n\nhttps://upload.umin.ac.jp/cgi-open-bin/ctr/ctr.cgi?function=brows&amp;action=brows&amp;type=summary&amp;recptno=R000006682&amp;language=E'] </code></pre>  <p>If you see each element of this column is a list of string. I want to get a final column where instead of each element being a list of string, it should combine all the string within a list and give as a string. </p>  <p>The problem is the list element itself is a string since it was created using array_agg. So it is not an iterable that I can use " ".join(column[0]). Gives an error that column[0] is not a list but of type 'list' </p>  <p>How to overcome this?</p>  <p>EDIT: </p>  <pre><code> If I do this:   for x in column:     s=" ".join(x)     docs.append(s)     break  </code></pre>  <p>it works. But if I want to do it for all without a break statement, it throws an error: </p>  <pre><code>for x in column:    s=" ".join(x)     docs.append(s) </code></pre>  <p>Error:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;ipython-input-154-556942a06d81&gt; in &lt;module&gt;() 1 for x in trials_notes.notes: ----&gt; 2 s=" ".join(x) 3 docs.append(s) 4 TypeError: can only join an iterable â€“ </code></pre>
