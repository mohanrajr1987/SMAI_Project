<p>I have an index-matrix and a matrix with my variables of same sizes:</p>  <pre><code> index = [a, c, c, b]  m = [0.23, 0.45, 1, 0.7] </code></pre>  <p>Now I need to apply an interpolation function using the variables in m, however based on the index in the index-matrix I need to choose from different values. So my values where to interpolate between:</p>  <pre><code>a = [(1, 0), (2, 0.2), (3, 0.6)] b = [(1, 0), (2, 0.5), (3, 0.9)] c = [(1, 0), (2, 0.3), (3, 0.5)] </code></pre>  <p>So, for the first calculation the value is 0.23 and the index a. So I need to apply numpy.interp using the coordinates in a and so on.</p>  <p>I can zip index and m and apply numpy.interp on a value by value basis. But since I need to apply this to huge datasets I would like a quicker way.</p>
