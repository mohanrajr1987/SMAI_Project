<p>I want to import a <em>dirty</em> csv file into a numpy object. I have a very few amount of values that are apparently not an <code>integer</code> or <code>float</code>, because the output is not of the correct dtype. </p>  <p>The code I use: </p>  <pre><code>d.data = np.genfromtxt(inputtable, delimiter=";",skip_header=2, comments="@", dtype=np.float) </code></pre>  <p>I would like to know if there is an easy way to just replace all non floats into -1 so that I do not need to find these values by hand in the <code>10.000+</code> rows.</p>
