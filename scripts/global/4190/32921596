<p>So, I know that you can do this by doing</p>  <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; arr[mask] = value </code></pre>  <p>However, if I want to make the code shorter (and not recompute the mask and index each time), I'd like to do something like this:</p>  <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; sub = arr[mask] &gt;&gt;&gt; sub[...] = value # This works in other cases, but not this one. </code></pre>  <p>My understanding is that doing <code>Ellipses</code> indexing should allow you to specify that you're not reassigning a given variable, but are rather broadcasting to the actual array.</p>  <p>So, here's the question: why doesn't it work?</p>  <p>My thinking is that it's related to the fact that:</p>  <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; arr[mask] is arr[mask] False </code></pre>  <p>But surely since the mask indexed versions are just views (not copies of the underlying structure), this shouldn't break assignment.</p>
