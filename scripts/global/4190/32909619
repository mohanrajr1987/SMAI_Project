<p>Following piece of code was working in numpy 1.7.1 but it is giving value error in the current version. I want to know the root cause of it.</p>  <pre><code>import numpy as np x = [1,2,3,4] y = [[1, 2],[2, 3], [1, 2],[2, 3]]  a = np.array([x, np.array(y)])   ----&gt; 5 a = np.array([x, np.array(y)]) </code></pre>  <p>ValueError: could not broadcast input array from shape (4,2) into shape (4) </p>
