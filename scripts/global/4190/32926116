<p>I need to install Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, and sklearn. I downloaded Numpy and Scipy individually from their websites, but Scipy warns not to install manually, and when I try to install Numpy I get an error 'could not locate executable g77'. Scipy recommends using Anaconda. I have downloaded Anaconda, but cannot see how to download Numpy and Scipy using it. Also, apparently, I can use Macports, for which I need Xcode, and I have tried downloading Xcode twice and it won't open - the reviews say the new version is buggy. Thus, what is the most conventional and effective way to install these tools? Did Anaconda automatically install Numpy and Scipy?</p>
