<p>I am using Spyder (v. 2.3.5.2). When I open files in the Editor, an encoding is displayed in the lower right corner of the Spyder Graphical User Interface (GUI). Depending on the file, this might vary:</p>  <ul> <li>Latin-1-Guessed</li> <li>UTF-8</li> <li>UTF-8-Guessed</li> <li>etc.</li> </ul>  <p>I have a file that is labeled as Latin-1-Guessed, but is is actually a different encoding, so it does not display the characters correctly. Is there a way to set the encoding that should be used with a given file to ensure that the content is displayed correctly in the Editor pane?</p>  <p>I have looked at length through the menus, built-in documentation, Google, SO, etc for Spyder and have not been successful.</p>  <p>Any assistance is appreciated.</p>
