<p>I'm working with a couple of student interns, showing them proof-of-concepts.  The amount of code we are writing is extremely small - snippets. I don't have to worry about version control or branches.</p>  <p>What I'm looking for is the simplest html editor for two people to be sharing a single document, not at the same time. In other words, it's ok if I totally overwrite his change if we are both making changes at the same time. In fact, that's preferred!</p>  <p>If we were on a local machine, I could use Notepad++. But since the code is on my VPS, then we are making changes in Dreamweaver and pushing changes up. That's too complicated because I make a change and he doesn't get the change unless he downloads it. We need to make the changes directly on the server with no intermediary steps. And when I make a change to his document, it reloads on his screen.</p>  <p>It needs to be as simple as two people using Notepad++ to change a file on a networked drive. Remote Desktop only allows 1 person to remote in at a time. Hmm... I wonder if that's really a restriction or if I could increase the number of concurrent users.</p>  <p>Hmm... I wonder if I could add my VPS drive as a networked drive? That would be slick...</p>
