<p>I am looking for a free editor that will support code hints/auto complete for THREE js. </p>  <p>Preferably a plugin for notepad++ but I will try just about any IDE that is free. I have heard that sublime 2 supports it but I want something I can use for free. </p>  <p>Also, I have tried to use Tern for Eclipse but for the life of me I can not get it to work.</p>  <p>Does anyone know of a good THREEjs editor or some magic way to get tern to work properly in Eclipse (using Latest Eclipse Java EE distribution)?</p>
