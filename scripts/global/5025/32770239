<p>I'm creating a file with a list variable that contains 2,000 string entries.  </p>  <p>Please note I'm not talking about when I run the code but just while I'm typing to create the file does my computer start to hog tons of memory. As soon as I delete all those words from line 6 is clears up.</p>  <p>I am editing in IDLE. The list is here: <a href="http://pastebin.com/uwpKriZ3" rel="nofollow">http://pastebin.com/uwpKriZ3</a></p>  <p><strong>FYI</strong></p>  <p>Here is the abbreviated sample code:</p>  <pre><code>import random  # The following line is unwrapped and, in the actual script, # contains 26431 characters comprising 2000 words: list1 = ['aback', 'abaft', 'abandoned', 'abashed', 'aberrant', 'abhorrent', 'abiding']  rndword = random.choice(list1) brokenword = list(rndword) </code></pre>
