<p>I intend to make a few bit flips in a (binary) file. </p>  <p>For example, I have a binary file; when opened in vim, it looks like below:</p>  <pre><code>516#^RË^F14#^RÀ^G14#^RÌ^H13#ü&lt;90&gt;   8#&lt;96&gt; </code></pre>  <p>If I change "&lt;96>" to "&lt;97>", <strong>is this equivalent to a bit flip?</strong></p>  <p><strong>What is the most convenient way to do it in Linux environments?</strong> </p>  <p><code>xxd</code> seems able to do this, but not convenient: each time I have to <code>xxd file1 file2</code>, then <code>vim file2</code>, after changing, then <code>xxd -r file2 file1</code>.</p>
