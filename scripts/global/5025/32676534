<p>I am currently using VS code develop my game with Unity.</p>  <p>Every time I open the editor, there is a 99+ Unnecessary using of directive which makes me unhappy. Since there are lots of dependency of 3rd party plugins, I'am not sure weather I can remove them. So I want to have some method to disable them. </p>  <p>I tried something like:</p>  <pre><code>"csharp.lint.unnecessaryUsingDirective": "ignore" </code></pre>  <p>But obviously, it doesn't work. So I wish there would be something I can do to hide or disable this warning.</p>
