<p>In the editor of wordpress, the visual tab , when I press the enter key to generate a line break between lines or paragraphs or phrases , wordpress instead of making the newline writes me "&amp; nbsp " and does not generate the jump line .</p>  <p>Why does this happen?</p>  <p>As you fix it ?</p>  <p>Thank you</p>
