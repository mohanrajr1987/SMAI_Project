<p>Because, I am a newbie in <a href="http://jsoftware.com/" rel="nofollow">J programming language</a>; so, its syntax is hard-to-read to me.</p>  <p>Now, I want to find a useful tool, which is a <em>syntax highlighter</em> for J language. It does not appear to have support in <a href="http://docs.notepad-plus-plus.org/index.php?title=User_Defined_Language_Files#J" rel="nofollow">NotePad++</a>.</p>  <p>Is there any editor for the source code files, of J programming language?</p>
