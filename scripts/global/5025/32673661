<p>To me, there seems to be a massive gap in the marketplace for such a tool, I have found the next closest thing, which is for the similar DXHTML web UI library. This has an online visual UI designer available <a href="http://dhtmlx.com/docs/products/visualDesigner" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>  <p>I prefer the look, feel, and coding style of jqWidgets though. I'm designing a web app with a large, complicated UI with split panes, multiple views, dynamically updating data, and various other things that demand an extensive UI library. jqWidgets has everything I need, but requires manual and time-consuming HTML/JavaScript editing.</p>  <p>Should I keep looking for something similar for jqWidgets or am I correct in my fear that no such tool exists?</p>
