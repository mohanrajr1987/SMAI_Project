<p>I was wondering if someone knows a library for Swift to let users draw a vector on an image and replace the color within the vector so the color is realistically applied to the image.</p>  <p>For example a user loads an image and it is than given the ability to draw a sort of vector shape by tapping on the image. Let's assume the user loads an image of a car and points out the door of the car.</p>  <p>Than the user can chose the color that should be applied to the car door.</p>  <p>Anyone know how to do this or where to start?</p>  <p>I assume the difficulty is:  - Manipulating the image; If the car door is red and the selected color is blue, the transparent overlay in combination with the car door color will result in purple instead of blue.  - Saving the image in original resolution with the applied changes. </p>  <p>Any help would be appreciated. A native library or external would be helpful. </p>  <p>Here is an example of an app working with this named WrapApp <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/PP3oB.png" rel="nofollow">http://i.stack.imgur.com/PP3oB.png</a></p>
