<p>I am a new user to emacs. I need to compare two files, one local file and another in a server.</p>  <p>I fireup emacs opening my local file. Now I split emacs into two using C-x 3. Now I opened up a shell in my second frame on the right. I opened a shell using M-x shell. Now ssh-ed into my server. I navigated to a deep location and I need to open a file from this location on my right buffer. I tried C-x C-f but its showing my location directory?</p>  <p>Is there a solution for this?</p>  <p>Edit: I think I stressed my problem wrongly. I just want to see both files open in emacs and read them together. Not really a diff.</p>
