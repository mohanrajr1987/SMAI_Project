<p>When a property is a simple component of any class, the IDE's property editor is able to drop down a list of all compatible components in all the project's forms. </p>  <p>I want to do some equivalent task, but with some filtering based on acceptable component classes for the property; these classes common ancestor is only <em>TComponent</em> and they have custom interfaces.</p>  <p>Currently I have a working property editor that uses a <em>paValueList</em> attribute and some filtering in the <em>GetValues</em> procedure, based on checking the supported interfaces, but it is limited to the current form :-(.</p>  <p>How to browse all the forms like the IDE does?</p>
