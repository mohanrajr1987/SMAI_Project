<p>I have a wordpress site which has styles made from the beginning to affect the original text editor wordpress .</p>  <p>For example:</p>  <p>If the text editor , in the "Visual " tab, I put a left-aligned image , this does not align , I assume that the class that you are placing the editor does not exist. This applies also to the " p " tags have different styles which you placed the editor ( "visual" tab).</p>  <p>Having explained this, how do I put classes and original styles of the "Visual " tab of the editor , so that it functions as it should ?</p>  <p>Any ideas ?</p>  <p>Thank you</p>
