<p>I was a bit surprised that this question hasn't been asked before. (If it has, apologies!) I am trying to find a good text editor with support for <code>rmarkdown</code> documents. Here are my criteria (in no particular order):</p>  <ul> <li>syntax highlighting (for both R code and markdown syntax)</li> <li>ability to send code from document to console for evaluation </li> <li>free &amp; open source </li> <li>autocompletion for bibtex entries</li> <li>cross-platform </li> </ul>  <p>I can't seem to find anything that fits the bill. Sublime Text can do all of this, but it's neither free nor open source... </p>  <p>I know a lot of people use RStudio, but its support for actually writing is not very good at all (e.g. bad spellcheck, no support for navigating a file, etc)... </p>
