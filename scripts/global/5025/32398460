<p>Let's say I have a code like this:</p>  <pre><code>#define ABC  #ifdef ABC int foo = 1; #else int bar = 2; #endif </code></pre>  <p>I want to modify displaying of the text inside <code>else</code> part of conditional compilation. </p>  <p>I'm using dark scheme in VS2012. Current setting will drop all colors except constants, comments and keywords which will get bit darker. I would like to change it to either drop all colors completely or change everything to different color.</p>  <p>I would really love to have the part which is not complied crossed (or at least italic) but that does not seem to be possible in VS editor at all.</p>
