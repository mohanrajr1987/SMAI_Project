<p>I am using Eclipse which not supports multi line regex Expressions (it is possible but it is not designed to do it). Can you suggest advanced editor which allow to enter such regex into nice multi line window.</p>  <p>I am skilled in regex so not asking how to do it but where I can do it efficiently - in readable way with simple copy paste - with some preview of changes.</p>  <p>For example I want refactor such code:</p>  <pre><code>class some_name(object):   def some_name(self):     pass </code></pre>  <p>Regex search:</p>  <pre><code>class (some_name)\(object\):   def (some_name)\(self\):     pass </code></pre>  <p>Regex replace:</p>  <pre><code>class \1_new(object):   def \2_new(self):     pass </code></pre>  <p>Result:</p>  <pre><code>class some_name_new(object):   def some_name_new(self):     pass </code></pre>  <p>Code is simplified to give better example but it can be more lines too. Can you suggest how to do it in efficient way.</p>
