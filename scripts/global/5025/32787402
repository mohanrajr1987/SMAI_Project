<p>I am working with pipe delimited files which go off my screen horizontally. I wish to pivot the data so that each horizontal line is displayed vertically. A solution in MS-Excel would work, or a dedicated text-editor (such as "UltraEdit," "Notepad++" or "Sublime Text" would also work)</p>  <p>For example, the original pipe-delimited file is: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/38BQj.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/38BQj.jpg" alt="How it&#39;s showing now..."></a></p>  <p>I want it to be shown, like so: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/UnspC.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/UnspC.jpg" alt="How I wan tit to show..."></a></p>  <p>I want to be able to edit these fields, and save the file in the original horizontally formatted file that I started off with. The focus is on being able to see the line numbers, making the fields easier to edit.</p>  <p>I have tried using Excel and it opens my file and places each element in the original format within a cell, but within 3 rows, horizontally. I need "Names, "Fruits" and "Cars" to be turned into columns, not rows.</p>  <p>Thank you!</p>
