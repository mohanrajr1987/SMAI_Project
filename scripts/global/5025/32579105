<p>My website is in Asp.net and I am using MySql as database. I have some sample math papers in Microsoft office word. I want any kind of HTML input tool like textbox or editor so that I can copy office word formulas direct to editor and that I have to save into database</p>  <p>Example:</p>  <ol> <li>Solve the inequation and represent the solution on the number line:  (7x-5)/(2x+14)   ≥ 1 1/4 (x ≥ -7), x ∈ R.   [x ≥ 5]</li> </ol>  <p>Consider the above question if I do copy paste into textbox some of symbols it takes as garbage..</p>
