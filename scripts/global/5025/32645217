<p>I'm trying to use Visual Studio as an editor for browsing a large open source project on GitHub. The directory structure looks like</p>  <pre><code>/module1/include/ /module1/src/ /module2/include/ /module2/src/ ... </code></pre>  <p>and build is maintained by CMakeLists.txt.</p>  <p>If I insist to use Visual Studio as an editor for some reason (for example, good IntelliSense support), what would be the best practice?</p>  <ol> <li><p>I tried "New - Project from Existing Code". It produces ugly project structure where all *.cpp files are under Source Files filter while I still need to manually specify a bunch of /*/include/ directories.</p></li> <li><p>I tried to actually use CMake to produce a visual studio solution. It immediately failed with many critical errors because of a lot of Linux dependencies.</p></li> </ol>  <p>Is there any way to create a visual studio solution with a proper directory structure and include paths?</p>
