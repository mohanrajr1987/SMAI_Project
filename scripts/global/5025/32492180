<p>I'm having trouble writing some javascript code in a googlesheet that will find all the current editors of the sheet (apart from the owner) and remove their edit writes. Currently I've been trying to use:</p>  <p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false"> <div class="snippet-code"> <pre class="snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>//remove the current editors and only allow the origional owner to have access. var SpreadSheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet(); SpreadSheet.removeEditor(SpreadSheet.getEditors())</code></pre> </div> </div> </p>  <p>This comes up with an "Invalid email:" with a string of editors emails. Is there a way to perhaps separate this email string then run the "removeEditor" code through a loop for the required number of editors that need to be removed?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance! </p>
