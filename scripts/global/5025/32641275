<p>Sorry if I was not able to describe in the title how I like to do; I know that in AndroidStudio there is a way to use this brackets notation</p>  <pre><code>protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)  {     super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);     setContentView(R.layout.activity_main); } </code></pre>  <p>instead this</p>  <pre><code>protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {     super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);     setContentView(R.layout.activity_main); } </code></pre>  <p>In other words I like that the first bracket of any method, class etc starts a new line. I know that it is possibile in preferences > editor but I'm not able to remember how I have to change. Thanks a lot and sorry for the stupid question.  </p>
