<p>Objective: To create a smaller version of node.js with the ultimate objective of creating a scripting language with some of the features of node (JS) and to add some of my own. </p>  <p>I understand, of course, that I need to look at the node.js source code but I could not find any parser code in the node.js source code on nodejs.org. Does node.js have its own parser (possibly using yacc or some such tool) as node.js is mostly written in C, C++? If so, where do I access it? Or does it reply on the V8 engine source code for parsing JS? I  believe that node.js language itself is not strictly V8 Javascript compliant. Or is it? Since V8 compiles JS to native machine code, surely it must have a full fledged parser/translator somewhere.</p>  <p>In short, can someone point me to the parser code to let me knock out some of the unwanted grammar rules from the node.js parser? Or is there some open source project already out there which has addressed this question? </p>
