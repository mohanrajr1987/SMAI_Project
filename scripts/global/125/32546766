<p>What I want to do is to code a program that takes file input or user input of string and check character by character if space or double/single quotation come in string then break it and make a separate string of that word. I used Split function to break words in string according to given delimiters. But my code isn't working for word enclosed in quotations. Actually, this task is related with Compiler Construction course.</p>  <p>For example:</p>  <p>User input: <code>sjhdfn"ff"fgfgfg".'\nff' 'f'</code></p>  <p>Output of words should be: <code>sjhdfn</code>         //ID</p>  <p><code>"ff"fgfgfg"</code>    //String</p>  <p><code>\n</code>             //Character = new line</p>  <p><code>ff</code>             //ID</p>  <p><code>'f'</code>            //Char</p>  <p>Can anyone help to code string part of output with double quotations?</p>
