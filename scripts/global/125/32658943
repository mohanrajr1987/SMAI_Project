<p>Recently, I have been studying compiler theory about lexical analysis. As I understood there some ways for constructing the lexical scanner, like :</p>  <ul> <li>Using Lex/Flex for generating the scanner automatically.</li> <li>Build your own one. In examples, I have encountered the switch case model using the read-ahead technique (simulating the DFA, NFA).</li> </ul>  <p>My question is which one of them is more suitable for implementing a basic programming language (consists variables, conditions, loop)? How they should be used in practise? Is it possible to use them both?</p>
