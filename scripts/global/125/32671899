<p>I have a doubt regarding the <strong>LR(1)</strong> automata construction:</p>  <p>Is the state with the kernel <strong>[A->b., x] (state_1)</strong> equivalent to the state with the kernel <strong>[A->b.,x/y] (state_2)</strong>?</p>  <p>Like, if I'm on the state <strong>[A->.b, x]</strong> and shift_b from this state, do I need to create state_1 if I already have state_2?</p>  <p>Hope it's clear.</p>
