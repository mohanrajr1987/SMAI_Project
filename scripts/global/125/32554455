<p>Currently i'm working to construct a lexical analyzer with Regular Expression, but I've a problem with this Regex</p>  <p>Regex: <code>([_#ñÑa-zA-Z][_#ñÑa-zA-Z0-9]*)|\b(\d+)|([,\.\(\);])|(')([^'\n]*)(')?|([\+\-\*\/])|(&lt;&gt;|&lt;=|&gt;=|&lt;|&gt;|=)|([^_#ñÑa-zA-Z0-9',\.\(\);\+\-\*\/&lt;&gt;=\s]).</code></p>  <p>Each group delimits the ambit of each <strong>token</strong> in the text, for example:</p>  <p>The <strong>group 1</strong>: ([<em>#ñÑa-zA-Z][</em>#ñÑa-zA-Z0-9]*) is for capturing identifiers or reserved words like "select", "insert", "into", etc.</p>  <p>The <strong>group 2</strong>: \b(\d+) is for capturing digits.</p>  <p>The <strong>group 3</strong>: ([,.();]) is for delimiters, like '.' or '(', etc.</p>  <p>The <strong>group 4-5-6</strong>: (')([^'\n]*)(')? is for capturing alphanumerics words and his apostrophes.</p>  <p>And now this is the problem, <strong>I want to capture apostrophes in the group 3 and no in the group 4 and 6</strong>, but if a put something like that in my regex ([.,()';])|'(\w+)' the alphanumeric group will be ignored.</p>  <p>My question is ¿How capture apostrophes in the group of delimiters without ignore the group of alphanumerics?</p>  <p>Alphanumerics group only need capture words, for example:</p>  <ul> <li>Input: 'asd$ asd'</li> <li>Capture: asd$ asd</li> </ul>  <p>Thats because apostrophes are captured in delimiters group.</p>  <p>Greetings and sorry for my bad English.</p>
