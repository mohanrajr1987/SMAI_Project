<p>I am making a subset of C compiler , where i need to read <code>source.c</code> file to further process the code , but problem is reading the source file ,it can be much bigger and as you know if i do something like <code>buffer[1000]</code> and continuously update it from file possibly i can <strong>loss some content to read and perform operation from the previous buffer state</strong>.</p>  <p>One way i possibly can achieve this is by <code>double buffer scheme</code> but i can't find good material to help me about implementing such class. I want to make a class name <code>DoubleBufferFileReder</code> so i just don't have to worry about handling buffer and file in code again and again.</p>
