<p>i read a lot about coding standards and tools to help you find code that needs to be improved. What i don't get is why compilers don't integrate this and enforce you to code in a certain way.</p>  <p>In my opinion it does not really matter what kind of coding standard you are using as long as there is one. It would be easier to share code as the standard is the same. I don't see negative sides to this approach.</p>  <p>So why is it not done like this?</p>
