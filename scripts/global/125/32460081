<p>Say I have an interval with characters <code>['A'-'Z']</code>, I want to match every of these characters except the letter <code>'F'</code> and I need to do it through the <code>^</code> operator. Thus, I don't want to split it into two different intervals.</p>  <p>How can I do it the best way? I want to write something like <code>['A'-'Z']^'F'</code> (All characters between A-Z except the letter F).

Therefore I want to exclude the doublequotes   because it obviously ends the string. (I am not considering escaped characters for the moment)</p>
