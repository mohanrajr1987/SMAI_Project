<p>Assume I have a very big source code and intend to make 'rdx' register totally unused during the execution i.e. While generating the assembly code, all I want is to inform my  compiler (GCC) that it should not use 'rdx' at all.</p>  <p><strong>NOTE: register rdx is just an example. I am OK with any available Intel x86 register</strong></p>  <p>I am even happy to update the source code of compiler and use my custom GCC. But where to change in source code?</p>
