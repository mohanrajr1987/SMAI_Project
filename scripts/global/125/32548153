<p>Hi i know this is too dumb to ask.</p>  <p>I have learned in Principles of Compiler Design by Ulman et.al and on the net that interpreter is different from compiler. the phases of compiler are lexical->parser->semantics->(then)intermediate code generator. But my instructor in Compiler Design course insisted to us that we design a compiler by having the following phases: lexical->parser->semantics->interpreter. is this possible? interpreting the output of semantics? did i miss some topics about designing the compiler? Thank you very much</p>
