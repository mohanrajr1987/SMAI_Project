<p>I am trying to make a lexer , i don't want to use <strong>lex</strong> file because i want to learn , so come to the point i want to make regular expression for an identifier following constraints:</p>  <p>'__' cannot be an identifier.  underscore always with some letter. Id contain at least one underscore. underscore cannot be last symbol of id.<br> Must have one or more digit. Not start with Digit.</p>  <p>Now regular expression I've done so far:</p>  <pre><code>([_a-zA-Z]*[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z]*[_a-zA-Z]*[0-9][0-9]*[_a-zA-Z]*)* </code></pre>  <p>Problem is i can't perform constraint about 'at least one _' in identifier , I can't make it more complex because i have to convert this regular expression to Non deterministic finite automaton , so could you help.</p>
