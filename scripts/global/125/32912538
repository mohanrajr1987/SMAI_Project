<p>I'm trying to write a Lexical Analyzer for C tokens by constructing DFAs for each of tokens and simulating them in C. Currently I'm trying to identify a string literal. By the definition, string literals are the characters that are enclosed between <code>"</code> .Consider the following program :</p>  <pre><code>#include&lt;stdio.h&gt; int main() {     char *a = "Hello "       "World";     printf("%s",a); } </code></pre>  <p>Output:</p>  <pre><code>Hello World </code></pre>  <p>So now I am confused whether i should consider <code>Hello</code> and <code>World</code> as seperate tokens or <code>Hello World</code> combined as a single token? Thank you ! :)</p>
