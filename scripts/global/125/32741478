<p>I was browsing over my code and I recalled something that the ActionScript compiler does: it simplifies unnecessary/redundant code, then compiles the result. I wanted to know if C# has the same sort of procedure.</p>  <p>If I have my understanding correctly, and assuming that this would be valid ActionScript (I know it's not), the compiler would take this:</p>  <pre><code>byte[] result = ServerWC.UploadValues("http://localhost", srvNvc); Console.WriteLine(Encoding.ASCII.GetString(result)); </code></pre>  <p>and simplify it to this:</p>  <pre><code>Console.WriteLine(Encoding.ASCII.GetString(ServerWC.UploadValues("http://localhost", srvNvc))); </code></pre>  <p>before compiling. Which compiler, C#->IL, or IL->machine, does the optimization take place? Do all compilers work this way?</p>
