<p>I am a beginner in OCaml and trying to build a parser, I want to have a list that stores all the methods in my class. This is one part that I have in my .mly file.  </p>  <pre><code>init_method_list:      { [] }     | method_list method_decl { List.rev($1) } ;  method_list:     method_decl { [ $1 ] }     | method_list method_decl { $2 :: $1 } ; </code></pre>  <p>Can anyone explain exactly what's going on here? Especially the :: operation. Been googling around but couldn't find the operator in the docs.  </p>  <p>I get that the list can be empty, or we make right recursive calls to fill it up with all the methods in class. <code>method_decl</code> just looks for the match of the specific token combinations that represents a method.</p>
