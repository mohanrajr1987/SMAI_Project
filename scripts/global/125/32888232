<p>I need to read a message that is written on many lines, for now I'm skipping the new line character '\n' but I need to replace the \n by a space while reading the message ( before compiling it ) </p>  <pre><code>**exemple:**  message: " I'm going to parse this message" </code></pre>  <p>If I skip the \n the message to parse will be " I'm goingto parsethismessage" but I need it to be " I'm going to parse this message"</p>  <p>Is there a way to replace \n by a space while going through the grammar in javacc? </p>
