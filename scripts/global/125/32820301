<p>I use Luabind to manually bind my classes to Lua. Each time I write a new class, I  do this binding manually. Is it possible to get a C++ compiler to output the details of a class, its functions, function signatures and overloaded functions' information as XML?</p>  <p>Or write a plugin for a C++ compiler to access this information? I could then use this information to generate the binding automatically.</p>  <p>Has anyone done something similar?</p>
