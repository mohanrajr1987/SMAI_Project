<p>Suppose I am writing a program in C like:</p>  <pre><code>Code: [1 global var, main(with local vars), 3 functions(with local vars)] </code></pre>  <p>Given that function calls will be made on a stack frame, how does the compiler know at one glance how much memory to allocate?</p>  <p>Does it ever happen that the compiler went wrong and the program got out-of-memory error? Or will the compiler always allocate exact or extra memory?</p>  <p>Does it mediate with the OS on this? Or does it take its own decisions? Does the OS intervene anyway?</p>  <p><strong>Edit:</strong> I found an answer which helps a lot: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/19102036/5324086">http://stackoverflow.com/a/19102036/5324086</a></p>
