<p>I'm trying to build a compiler and am quite lost at the moment. I have a main class and want to be able to declare additional classes with inheritance, i.e <code>class newClass extends classThatHasBeenDeclaredBefore { }</code> My input looks like </p>  <pre><code>input:         class_main class_list { /* New program created */ } </code></pre>  <p>and my <code>class_list</code> consists of all my classes in my program, it can also be empty.</p>  <p>A simple class is declared like this: </p>  <pre><code>class_decl:     CLASS_KWORD CLASS_ID         OPENCURLYBRACE              attributes_list             method_list         CLOSEDCURLYBRACE { /* Ok new class is created */}      | CLASS_KWORD CLASS_ID EXTENDS_KWORD CLASS_ID         OPENCURLYBRACE              attributes_list             method_list         CLOSEDCURLYBRACE { /* Has CLASS_ID Number 2 been declared before? */ } ; </code></pre>  <p>Is there any way I can check if the second <code>CLASS_ID</code> has already been declared or used before somehow? My thought is that my <code>class_list</code> is inreachable from where I try to add my new class, but I suck at OCaml.</p>
