<p>I'm a new member and I'm seeking help with CPU-OS programming. I have tried searching for tutorials but it doesn't help me with the compiler part. Anyone would be so kind to give me at least a tutorial or a sample code on how to print out a data or how to make a mathematical statement on its compiler. </p>
