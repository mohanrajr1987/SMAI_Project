<p>I have the following code : </p>  <pre><code>int main() { int i=0; for(i=0;i&lt;10000000;i++)         //do something return 0; } </code></pre>  <p>When I run this code using 'gcc -o file file.c' command, it is getting executed in 244 milli seconds and when I execute the same code using 'gcc -O3 file.c -o file' it is getting executed in 0 milli seconds(very little time which is shown as zero). I could not understand what optimization is done by -O3 flag in such a way that we get lot of speed in execution.</p>  <p>Any link,doc or an explaination regarding '-O3' optimization(apart from gcc.gnu.org, which I have seen and found the info given there is not sufficient to provide me a decent explaination and insight of what goes on) is much appreciated.</p>
