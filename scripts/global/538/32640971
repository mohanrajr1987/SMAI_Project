<p>The RabbitMq Management Plugin appears to listen only on the IPV4 addresses if the ip is not configured.  The typical configuration shown in the <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/mochiweb.html" rel="nofollow">documentation</a> is:</p>  <pre><code>[ {rabbitmq_management, [{listener, [{port, 12345}]}]} ]. </code></pre>  <p>The documentation also states:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Use ip to specify an interface for mochiweb to bind to (giving an IP address as a string or tuple).</p> </blockquote>  <p>From that, if you specify the IPv6 loopback address, such as:</p>  <pre><code>[ {rabbitmq_management, [{listener, [{port, 12345}, {ip, "::"}]}]} ]. </code></pre>  <p>it will listen on the IPV6 addresses, but not IPV4.  Specifying an ip of "0.0.0.0" (or omitting the setting) listens on IPV4 only.</p>  <p>The documentation implies that you can use a tuple here, but I have been unsuccessful in understanding what an <a href="http://www.erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/data_types.html#id70396" rel="nofollow">erlang tuple</a> is well enough to make this setting and have the management plugin successfully start. </p>  <p>I've tried the following (and other variations) with error messages such as <em>could_not_start_listener</em>:</p>  <pre><code>{ip, "::", "0.0.0.0"} {ip, {"::", "0.0.0.0"}} </code></pre>  <p>What is the magic necessary for hosting this on both IPV4 and IPV6 endpoints? </p>
