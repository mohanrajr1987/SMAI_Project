<p>I want to write a program which will read in a list of tuples, and in the tuple it will contain two elements. The first element can be an Object, and the second element will be the quantity of that Object. Just like: <code>Mylist([{Object1,Numbers},{Object2, Numbers}])</code>. <br> Then I want to read in the <code>Numbers</code> and print the related Object <code>Numbers</code> times and then store them in a list. <br>  So if <code>Mylist([{lol, 3},{lmao, 2}])</code>, then I should get <code>[lol, lol, lol, lmao, lmao]</code> as the final result. <br> My thought is to first unzip those tuples (imagine if there are more than 2) into two tuples which the first one contains the Objects while the second one contains the quantity numbers. <br>  After that read the numbers in second tuples and then print the related Object in first tuple with the exact times. But I don't know how to do this. THanks for any help!  </p>
