<p>I cannot find a clear definition of what Erlang OTP is and what purpose does it serve. Can anyone give a brief introduction to what it is and what it does?</p>  <p>On <a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp" rel="nofollow">erlang/otp</a>, it says </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Erlang is a programming language used to build massively scalable soft real-time systems with requirements on high availability. Some of its uses are in telecom, banking, e-commerce, computer telephony and instant messaging. Erlang's runtime system has built-in support for concurrency, distribution and fault tolerance.</p>      <p>OTP is set of Erlang libraries and design principles providing middle-ware to develop these systems. It includes its own distributed database, applications to interface towards other languages, debugging and release handling tools.</p> </blockquote>
