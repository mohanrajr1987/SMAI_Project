<p>I know that ETS has limited concurrency, for instance two writes to the same row at the same time aren't going to collide.  But I can't seem to find out this sort of information for DETS.  Does anyone know?</p>  <p>Note that I'm not asking about DETS running under the auspices of Mnesia, and I'm not asking about any particular scheme - say assigning a single process per row of the DETS table.  I just want to know what the limited concurrency guarantees of DETS are, if any.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
