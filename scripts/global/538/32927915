<p>I have a gem in ruby that does translations using google API and I am "translating" it to Elixir.</p>  <p>For example, I get from API some like this: <a href="https://translate.google.com/translate_a/single?client=p&amp;sl=en&amp;tl=pt-CN&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;dt=t&amp;dt=rm&amp;q=Hello," rel="nofollow">api-data</a></p>  <p>And in Ruby today I do this:</p>  <pre><code>  encoded = rawdata.force_encoding("UTF-8") </code></pre>  <p>I would like to know if there is a way to "force_encode" (like Ruby does) but with Elixir?</p>
