<p>Recently I started learning Erlang, coming from an imperative background things are somewhat different...</p>  <p>I was doing fine (learning Erlang) till I came across something I did not understood while working in Eshell, can someone explain me what is happening?</p>  <pre><code>17&gt; One. 1 18&gt; One = 1. 1 19&gt; true andalso f(One). ok 20&gt; One. 1 </code></pre>  <p>Why <code>One</code> is still bound to a value? Since the right side of the expression was indeed evaluated. Now, If I use <code>f()</code> alone, things work as expected</p>  <pre><code>21&gt; f(One). ok 22&gt; One. * 1: variable 'One' is unbound </code></pre>  <p>Why?</p>
