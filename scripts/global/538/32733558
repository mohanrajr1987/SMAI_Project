<p>I am using mnesia table.This table has two attributes(primary key and its value). Now i am trying delete a tuple from mnesia table.I am using delete/1 function of mnesia for deletion purpose.This function takes table name and key corresponding to tuple fro which deletion has to be made.My problem is how can i handle the scenrio when tuple corresponding to passed key is not present.This delete function gives {atomic,ok} every time?</p>
