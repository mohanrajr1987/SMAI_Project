<p>I am trying to make a program that will read in a number and then output every digit of that number in a list. However, most of the things look fine until I try with number 8 and 9. The program only output <code>\b</code> <code>\t</code> instead. <br/> if the input number contains 8 or 9, and in the same time there are other numbers, for example <code>283</code>, it will print normally. Otherwise if there is only 8 or 9, such as<code>8</code>, <code>99</code>, then it will give me that binary representation of 8 and 9 (if I remember correctly). <br> My program is as below:<br> <code>digitize(0)-&gt; 0;</code><br> <code>digitize(N) when N &lt; 10 -&gt; [N];</code><br> <code>digitize(N) when N &gt;= 10 -&gt; digitize(N div 10)++[N rem 10].</code></p>
