<p>I was reading Programming with Sockets in Armstrong's 'Software for a Concurrent World book' and tried to work out an example on making a connection to Google website and getting the page content,</p>  <pre><code>connect(Url) -&gt; {ok, Socket} = gen_tcp:connect(Url,80,[binary,{packet,0}]), ok = gen_tcp:send(Socket, "GET / HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n"), receive_msg(Socket, []). </code></pre>  <p>I thought this was because Google used https and so I checked with other websites that used http and this time I got 403 Forbidden Error.</p>  <p>Currently wont this code work?</p>
