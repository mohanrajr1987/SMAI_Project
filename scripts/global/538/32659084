<p>I have created a function which will check if there is any even number in a given list, and then the even numbers are collected in a list. However I am stuck at where I want to print out each even number from that list in a new line. </p>  <p>Here is my code snippet: </p>  <pre><code>even_print([])-&gt; []; even_print([H|[]]) -&gt; [H]; even_print([H|T]) when H rem 2 /= 0 -&gt; even_print(T); even_print([H|T]) when H rem 2 == 0 -&gt; [H|even_print(T)], io:format("printing: ~n", H). </code></pre>  <p>I am thinking maybe list comprehensions, but I also want to try it without the list comprehensions.</p>
