<p>I have just learnt how to upgrade a module in Erlang and I know that only the function calls that use the fully qualified names (eg. <code>module:function()</code>) gets "relinked" to the current version loaded into the VM, but the function calls that do not specify the module's name do not get "relinked" to the current version, but keep using the older one.</p>  <p>Is there a rule of thumb on when to use a fully qualified function call and when it's OK to call a function just by its name? Is it a bad idea to call all functions using their full name (like <code>module:function()</code>)?</p>
