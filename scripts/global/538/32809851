<p>I have always started nitrogen to run as a daemon using the command below:</p>  <pre><code>sudo /home/someuser/myapp/bin/nitrogen start </code></pre>  <p>It works well but i have to repeat the same activity should the server reboot.</p>  <p>Most web servers by default start at boot time. When nitrogen is started, it starts the underlying Erlang web server. Unfortunately I have not found any single resource talking about starting nitrogen at boot time.</p>  <p>How do you start nitrogen as a daemon at system boot time?</p>
