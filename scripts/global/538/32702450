<p>I'm applying the following command to two erlang prompts, they all generate the same sequence of random number, so does it mean it is pseudo random in Erlang language? I'm curious about the rationale, since in Java, the sequence will not be the same even if I provide it with the same seed for two times. Many thanks!</p>  <pre><code>random:seed(6, 6, 6). random:uniform(100). random:uniform(100). ...  the generated sequence: 12, 27, 79, 58, 90, 25, ... </code></pre>
