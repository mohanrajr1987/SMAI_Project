<p>I am new to Erlang and we are working on a small scale messaging server.</p>  <p>We are trying to build a process registry using Redis ( not planning to use existing once grpoc, global etc due to other business needs ) as a datastore ( store to hold user-id to "node | PID " mapping). When a process starts it register itself with Redis in the form user_id (key) and {node | pid } as value. ( pid is tored as string in redis)</p>  <p>example value inserted in redis are "user_abc", {one@mf, "0.37.0>"}</p>  <p>Now when I try to find PID for "user_abc" which is running in the cluster - i get {node and pid} as value on a remote node which in this case is {one@mf, "0.37.0>".</p>  <p>Question is how do we use {node, pid} details on remote node to connect to the process user_abc.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p>
