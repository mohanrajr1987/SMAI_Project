<p>I am learning erlang and I tried this project - <a href="https://github.com/hcs42/cowboy_tutorial_webchat" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/hcs42/cowboy_tutorial_webchat</a>.</p>  <p>I build it using </p>  <pre><code>./rebar compile generate skip-deps=true &amp;&amp; rel/chat/bin/chat console </code></pre>  <p>In case of LAMP, if I would change .js file, I would only reload page and new changes would be applied.</p>  <p>In case of this erlang project, everytime I change something in .js file I must recompile and generate using rebat. Why is that so?</p>  <p>Also, if I look at the JS implementation, message is sent using</p>  <pre><code>socket.send(message); </code></pre>  <p>and is received on server side as:</p>  <pre><code>websocket_handle({text, Msg}, Req, State) -&gt; {reply, {text, &lt;&lt; "You said: ", Msg/binary &gt;&gt;}, Req, State}; </code></pre>  <p>How does this work, if cowboy accepts {text,Msg},Req,State but client send only text? Also client never gets {reply,{text,YouSaid...}, but only gets plain text message?</p>
