<p>I'm reading Programming Erlang, in Chapter 5 of the book it says:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Records are just tuples in disguise, so they have the same storage and performance   characteristics as tuples. Maps use more storage than tuples and have   slower lookup properties. </p> </blockquote>  <p>In languages I've learned before, this is not the case. Maps are usually implemented as a Hash Table, so the lookup time complexity is <code>O(1)</code>; Records (Tuples with names) are usually implemented as an immutable List, and the lookup time complexity is <code>O(N)</code>.</p>  <p>What's different in the implementation of these data structures in Erlang?</p>
