<p>There's a list of <a href="http://www.erlang.org/doc/applications.html" rel="nofollow">official Erlang/OTP applications</a>. Will all of them come along with the latest Erlang/OTP installation? Otherwise, how to know  which of them are actually installed and continue to install the missing?</p>  <p><strong>@EDIT</strong></p>  <p>Many of the official applications are <code>deb</code>'ed individually on Ubuntu from <a href="https://www.erlang-solutions.com/downloads/download-erlang-otp" rel="nofollow">Erlang/OTP repos</a> of Erlang Solutions (checking on <code>Installation using repository</code>), so <code>apt/deb</code> does the job.  </p>
