<p>I have 2 checkboxes and in my controller i want to be able to know if those checkboxes are checked or not. My code :</p>  <p>in .h :</p>  <pre><code>@property (weak, nonatomic) IBOutlet Checkbox *option1Button; @property (weak, nonatomic) IBOutlet Checkbox *option2Button; </code></pre>  <p>in controller.m:</p>  <pre><code>- (IBAction)optionButton1Pressed:(id)sender {    NSLog(@"first : %lu second : %lu", (unsigned long)[_option1Button state], (unsigned long)[_option2Button state]); }  - (IBAction)optionButton2Pressed:(id)sender {    NSLog(@"first : %lu second : %lu", (unsigned long)[_option1Button state], (unsigned long)[_option2Button state]); } </code></pre>  <p>The action mapped is "touch up inside".  And what i can see in the logs is that state is always 1 if i check or uncheck the checkboxes. Everytime that i click, it's a 1</p>  <p>I've tried with "editing changed" but it's never called</p>  <p>Any idea?</p>
