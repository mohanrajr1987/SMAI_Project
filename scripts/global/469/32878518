<p>We are using integrated authentication; however one of our websites requires the user to check a box to enable/acknowledge Integrated Authentication, then click a "login" button.</p>  <p>I'd like to streamline our users experience by providing them with a direct link which would already include the IntegratedAuthentication checkbox as being checked.</p>  <p>Is this possible?</p>  <p>The data field input name and id is "IntegratedAuthentication" The primary page link is "<a href="https://website/account/LogIn" rel="nofollow">https://website/account/LogIn</a>" I've tried adding variances of the following to the primary page link with no success:</p>  <pre><code>https://website/account/LogIn?_eventid=&amp;IntegratedAuthentication=1 https://website/account/LogIn?_eventid=IntegratedAuthentication=true </code></pre>
