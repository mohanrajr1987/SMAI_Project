<p>I am iterating through a string of characters and finding a checkbox. I find the checkbox without any problems and if the character of the iteration is equal to 't', I set the Checked property of the checkbox to true. </p>  <p>However, for whatever reason, although it does check the appropriate checkboxes, executing this code also means that when I click any checkbox myself, nothing happens (everything works just fine and I can check anything until I execute this code). Also, the submit button on my page no longer does anything if I execute this code. I'm puzzled as to what may be the reason for this. </p>  <p>The buttons are created programmatically on init and are located inside an update panel.</p>  <pre><code>DateTime date = new DateTime(2015, 11, 18);  foreach (char c in attendee.accommodation) {      ID = "accommodationCheckBox" + date.ToShortDateString();      CheckBox checkbox = (CheckBox)FindControl(ID);      if (checkbox != null &amp;&amp; c == 't')          {              checkbox.Checked = true;          }      date = date.AddDays(1); } </code></pre>  <p>Here is an example of how the checkbox looks like in the end: <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/Lzxo047o/" rel="nofollow">https://jsfiddle.net/Lzxo047o/</a></p>
