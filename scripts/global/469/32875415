<p>My question is in 2 parts.</p>  <p>I would like to add a checkbox to a table. What's the best way to do that?</p>  <p>Secondly, I would like to have all checkboxes selected when the top most checkbox is selected, and to have all the checkboxes de-selected when the top most checkbox is clicked again. However, the user should also be able to select a few items on the checkbox; if they choose to do so.</p>
