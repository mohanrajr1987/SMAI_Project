<p>I am trying to get a list of shortest paths from a given start node to all nodes that are within a given range. Each edge is weighted and I am trying to use the sum of these weights as the range, rather than the number of steps. </p>  <p>The following works for limiting steps, but I'm not sure how to aggregate and limit path edge weights or return paths properly.</p>  <pre><code>g.v(1).out.loop(1){it.loops &lt; 3}{true}.dedup </code></pre>  <p>Thanks for any help!</p>
