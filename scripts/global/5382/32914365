<p>I want to make the whole webpage into a graph, like a blueprint (the colour scheming). And then i want to plot a graph in the same page. So should i use some code to make the grid or should i just make an image file and make it the background. The grid should be preferably something like this : <a href="http://www.math-drills.com/graphpaper/images/graph_paper_threeline_metric_200_100_025_001_pin.jpg" rel="nofollow">Graph</a>, or with the proper coloring <a href="http://cdn2.stormgrounds.com/stormgrounds-cdn/media/blue-print-graph.jpg" rel="nofollow">Blueprint Graph</a></p>  <p>If code is suggested, please give an overview of how to do so. Thank You.</p>
