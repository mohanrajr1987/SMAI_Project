<p>On my knowledge base deployed on Virtuoso v7.2.1 I've two RDF graphs, namely <a href="http://example.com/A" rel="nofollow">http://example.com/A</a> and <a href="http://example.com/B" rel="nofollow">http://example.com/B</a>, populated by triples. </p>  <p>I'd like to create a virtual graph <a href="http://example.com/VG" rel="nofollow">http://example.com/VG</a> that should represent the union of <a href="http://example.com/A" rel="nofollow">http://example.com/A</a> and <a href="http://example.com/B" rel="nofollow">http://example.com/B</a>.  Therefore, any change on either <a href="http://example.com/A" rel="nofollow">http://example.com/A</a> and <a href="http://example.com/B" rel="nofollow">http://example.com/B</a> should be propagated to <a href="http://example.com/VG" rel="nofollow">http://example.com/VG</a>. </p>  <p>Digging into the documentation I did not find pointers and the closest thing to do, the so-called RDF View, operates on tables and not RDF graphs.  Has anyone a suggestion on how to implement it? Thanks in advance</p>
