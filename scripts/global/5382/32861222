<p>How do I query all locations/coordinates from all posts in a certain <em>(open)</em> Facebook group?</p>  <p>I need them to map the users locations for some kind of research.</p>  <p>I tried searching the documentation and here but couldn't find it. Also tried in Facebook graph:</p>  <pre><code>group_id/feed?fields=id,name,coordinates </code></pre>  <p>but it only gives me a weird number, e.g.:</p>  <pre><code>{ "data": [{  "id": "groupid_913215315438636"} </code></pre>
