<pre><code>What am I missing, My program won't give me any outputs. I am also getting an error "constructor class cannot applied given types" like that. </code></pre>  <p>Our lesson is all about Depth First Search and Binary graph but I made a mistake not to attend class, so now I'm regretting it. Please someone help me.</p>  <p>I can't add some details cause I really don't know how this program works though so I'm really really sorry.</p>  <pre><code>public class MainDriver{      public static void main(String[] args) {          Graph mygraph = new Graph(22);         mygraph.addEdge(1,2);         mygraph.addEdge(2,4);         mygraph.addEdge(2,5);         mygraph.addEdge(4,8);         mygraph.addEdge(4,9);         mygraph.addEdge(8,16);         mygraph.addEdge(8,17);         mygraph.addEdge(9,18);         mygraph.addEdge(9,19);         mygraph.addEdge(5,10);         mygraph.addEdge(5,11);         mygraph.addEdge(10,20);         mygraph.addEdge(10,21);         mygraph.addEdge(1,3);         mygraph.addEdge(3,6);         mygraph.addEdge(3,7);         mygraph.addEdge(6,12);         mygraph.addEdge(6,13);         mygraph.addEdge(7,14);         mygraph.addEdge(7,15);       }       DepthFirstSearch dfs = new DepthFirstSearch(G,v );    }   ----------  Here's my subclass  public class DepthFirstSearch{  private boolean[] marked; private int count;  public DepthFirstSearch(Graph G, int s) {     marked = new boolean[G.getV()];     dfs(G, s);   }     private void dfs(Graph G, int v) {      marked[v] = true;     System.out.print(v);     count++;      for (int w : G.adj(v)) {         if (!marked[w]) {             dfs(G, w);         }      }   }  public boolean marked(int w) {     return marked[w];  }   public int count() {     return count; }  }  </code></pre>
