<p>I am currently trying to render a stack of KEGG graphs that have been modified with mirIntegrator and pathway enrichment has been run with ROntoTools. THe pathway rendering is being processed with the following <code>lapply</code> function:</p>  <pre><code>lapply(peRes@pathways, function (p) {   g&lt;-layoutGraph(p@map,layoutType="dot")   #capture the number and name of the pathway we are up to   j=j+1   name.list = c(name.list,names(peRes@pathways[j]))   #only process those pathways which have nodes that contain 'miR'    tryCatch(if(sum(grep(pattern=".miR.",x = g@nodes, ignore.case = TRUE))) {     #capture the name and number of the pathway thet contains 'miR'     name.list.mir&lt;-c(name.list.mir,names(peRes@pathways[i]))     i = i+1     graphRenderInfo(g)&lt;-list(fixedsixe=FALSE)     edgeRenderInfo(g)&lt;-peEdgeRenderInfo(p)     nodeRenderInfo(g)&lt;-peNodeRenderInfo(p)     #to save some time don't render for now     #renderGraph(g)   })   #output the number of pathways passed through lapply (j), thier names (name.list)   #output the number of pathways passed through rendering (i), and thier names (name.list.mir)   i&lt;&lt;-i   name.list&lt;&lt;-name.list   name.list.mir&lt;&lt;-name.list.mir   j&lt;&lt;-j   }) </code></pre>  <p>The function fails with:</p>  <pre><code>Error in cut.default(abs(pf[pf &lt;= 0]), 256) : 'breaks' are not unique </code></pre>  <p>which traceback shows it is coming from:</p>  <pre><code>nodeRenderInfo(g)&lt;-peNodeRenderInfo(p) </code></pre>  <p>The odd thing is if the last pathway returned by the if() statement is run through the following code line by line:</p>  <pre><code>p&lt;-peRes@pathways$`path:rno04380` g&lt;-layoutGraph(p@map,layoutType="dot") graphRenderInfo(g)&lt;-list(fixedsixe=FALSE) edgeRenderInfo(g)&lt;-peEdgeRenderInfo(p) nodeRenderInfo(g)&lt;-peNodeRenderInfo(p) renderGraph(g) </code></pre>  <p>the pathway is rendered and plots without error.</p>  <p>I think it has something to to with my <code>lapply</code> function and the way it is accessing the elements of peRes though I'm not sure. I would like to put some demo data up but a dput for just one pathway is massive. If there are suggestions for how to make the data available I'm open to them. </p>
