<p>I am new to matlab coding and I would like to know how to plot a tour visiting all points in a minimum spanning tree (yes, TSP/TSM). I was given a set of points a matrix of 20x2 and I was able to find out the MST of these points and I need help figuring out how to plan a tour of these points of minimum possible distance?</p>  <p>my adj matrix for the MST is,</p>  <pre><code>X_st =       0     0     1     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     1     0     0     0      0     0     0     0     0     0     0     1     0     0     0     0     0     1     0     0     0     0     0     0      1     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     1     0     0     0     0     0      0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     1     0      0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     1      0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     1     0     0     0     1     0     1      0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     1     0     0     0     0     0     1     0     0     0      0     1     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     1     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0      0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     1     0     0      0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     1     0      0     0     0     0     0     0     1     1     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0      0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     1     0      0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     1     0     0     0     0     0      0     1     0     0     0     1     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     1     0     0     0     0      0     0     1     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     1     0     0     0     0     0     0     0      0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     1     0     0     0     0     1     0      1     0     0     0     0     0     1     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0      0     0     0     0     0     1     0     0     1     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0      0     0     0     1     0     0     0     0     0     1     0     1     0     0     0     1     0     0     0     0      0     0     0     0     1     1     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0 </code></pre>  <p>Obtained from kruskal algorithm to plot a MST of a complete graph.</p>  <p>My, neighbouring weighted matrix obtained from kruskal function is,</p>  <pre><code>     1     3      7    17      5    20      6    14      1    17      6    20     16    19      2    14      7    11      6    18     12    19     14    16     10    19      8    11      2     8      3    15      9    18      4    19     13    15 </code></pre>  <p>Any guidance would be much appreciated.</p>
