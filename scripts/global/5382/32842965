<p>I want to check whether a node with a certain ID is already in my graph or whether I have to create a new object. At the moment I am doing it with the following code:</p>  <pre><code>// at this point I have the attributes for the node I need  String id = getIdOfNeededNode(); // The id is used to search for the node in the graph  // now I have to search for the node in the graph Node node = new Node("dummy_id"); // This is the line I don't like;                                    // I would prefer not to have a dummy node                                   // but the compiler will then complain that the node might not be initialized   boolean alreadyCreated = false;  for(Node r : graph.getVertices()){ // search for the node with this id in the graph     if (r.getId().equals(portId)){         node = r;         alreadyCreated = true;         break;         }     }  if (!alreadyCreated) {     // create a new object if the node was not found     node = new Resource(portId);     createdPortResources.add(port);     }  // In the remainder of the program, I am working with the node object which then is in the graph </code></pre>  <p>The fact that I am creating a dummy node that is just a placeholder is really ugly. Please let me know how I can solve this problem in a more elegant way.</p>
