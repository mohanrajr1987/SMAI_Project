<p>How I can designate top in graph's such that They occur in all cycles of the graph?</p>  <p>For example:</p>  <p>We have a graph:</p>  <p>4 5</p>  <p>1 2</p>  <p>2 3</p>  <p>3 1</p>  <p>3 4</p>  <p>4 2</p>  <p>Where first number is the number of top, second is number of edges.</p>  <p>Result:</p>  <p>2 3</p>  <p>Where this numbers is a numbery vertices which can not be removed , because the graph will be acyclic</p>  <p>My question:</p>  <p>How can I check it as soon as possible?</p>
