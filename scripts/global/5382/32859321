<p>I wish to plot barplots for different categories (V, C and S in the dummy data) for values of different variables (v1-v5) to see how ranges of the different categories vary across the variable. Is there a way to do it in R ? </p>  <pre><code> Factor   v1  v2  v3  v4  v5       v 12.0 8.4 5.3 3.0 3.5       v 11.8 7.5 4.7 2.8 3.7       c 13.2 9.5 5.7 3.0 4.1       c 13.4 9.3 6.3 3.3 3.8       c 10.5 7.7 5.0 2.5 3.2       s 13.1 9.6 5.4 3.1 3.9       s 15.0 9.0 5.1 4.5 9.0 </code></pre>  <p>Its should be a very simple code using some package, but I have not been able to figure it out. </p>
