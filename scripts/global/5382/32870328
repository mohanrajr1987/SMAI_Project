<p>Hi I have data as follows and would like to generate a bar graph. I have researched about numpy and matplotlib but haven't been able to understand them totally.</p>  <p>The sample data is as follows<br> Phone          16GB   64GB    128GB<br> iPhone5        123    456     789<br> iPhone5s       123    456     789<br> iPhone 6       123    456     789<br> iPhone 6s      123    456     789  </p>  <p>I want to read this file and plot a bar graph as follows: The phone names(iPhone 5, iPhone5s etc.) should be on the xaxis. For each phone we plot the value corresponding to the 16GB, 64Gb, 128Gb versions as a bar graph. </p>  <p>The first row and column should be used as labels. Can someone pelase provide with a sample python code template to do this using numpy and matplotlib. I have only basic understanding of both of them.</p>
