<p>Let</p>  <ul> <li>m = Number of Edges in a graph     </li> <li>n = Number of Vertices in a graph</li> </ul>  <p>Assume graph G(V,E) is undirected and connected.</p>  <p>What I did is substitute m with (n*(n-1)/2), since that is the maximum possible edge in terms of number of nodes.</p>  <p>So, I found it to be true,</p>  <p>But, the real answer is false.</p>  <p>Can some one explain conceptually what is meant to be comparing to Big-Oh complexities?</p>
