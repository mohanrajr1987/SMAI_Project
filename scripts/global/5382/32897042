<p>Let G = (V,E) be a directed graph with edge weights w(e) >0 for all edges. For all paths p, let m(p) = max{w(e), such that e is an edge on the path p}. Let the set of vertices, V = {1, ..., n}. For all pairs (i, j) E V , let d(i, j) = min({m(p), such that p is a path from i to j} or d(i, j)=infinity if no such path exists. Show that d(i, j) for all i, j with 1 &lt;= i &lt;= n and 1 &lt;= j &lt;= n can be computed in O(n3) time (in other words present the algorithm and proof).</p>
