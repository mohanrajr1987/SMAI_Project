<p>I have the image being produced as an output in python(spyder). The numbers on y-axis are all cluttered, and it is impossible to read them. How can make the graph such that every number on that y-axis is clear to read. I would also want to change the length of x-axis, so that a user can get an idea of what value each bar corresponds to on the x-axis. It is really hard to read at this point.</p>  <p>So, yes I do want to change both the x-axis and y-axis in their own ways as I mentioned above. Please help me with this. I am using import matplotlib.pyplot as plt, so please don't change that. Please follow the link below for the image of the graph I am getting.</p>  <p><a href="http://i57.tinypic.com/6g8obb.png" rel="nofollow">http://i57.tinypic.com/6g8obb.png</a></p>  <p>Here is the code:</p>  <pre><code>tempArray = myNumpRead[:,1] barh = plt.subplot(111) width = 0.8 barh.barh(range(len(states)), tempArray) barh.set_ylim(-width,len(states)+width) barh.set_yticks(np.arange(len(states)) + width/2) barh.set_yticklabels(states, rotation=0) plt.title('Population by State') plt.xlabel('Population') plt.ylabel('State Ticker') plt.grid(True) plt.show() </code></pre>  <p>Thank You for the help.</p>
