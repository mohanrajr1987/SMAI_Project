<p>I'm using Tableau 9.0.2 to generate graphs and I can't for the life of me figure out how to move (ideally drag, right?) the field name for my x-axis from the top to the bottom of the graph, by the units, where it should be. </p>  <p>I'm attaching a picture because it's probably the easiest way to make clear what I'm trying to do, given this is a question of positioning:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/7TxsX.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/7TxsX.png" alt="Tableau graph with field name &quot;Iterations&quot; at top of graph, not bottom"></a></p>  <p>This Tableau graph has the field name "Iterations" at the top of the graph, not the bottom, where it should be. While this might not seem like a huge concern, it means that these graphs are not immediately exportable.</p>  <p>How can I move the label "Iterations" to the bottom of the graph, next to its axis? </p>  <p>The answer currently offered below allows for manual image modification within Tableau, which is unsatisfactory. It seems bizarre to me that the default, unchangeable behavior of Tableau goes against standard practice in graphing (labels next to labelled). </p>
