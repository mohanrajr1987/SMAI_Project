<p>I am trying to represent in one graph mean, upper and lower bound for 5 variables across 3 different groups. So I would like a CI plot with the variables as X-Axis and for example all CIs for the groups in different colors. For variable 1 there would be 3 CIs next to each other and then the next variable. I am looking for some way to show differences between variables as well as across groups in one compact graph.</p>  <p>So far I could only do either one. Something like </p>  <pre><code> ciplot v1 v2 v3 v4 v5, by (group)  </code></pre>  <p>does not work :(</p>  <p>If you have a good solution for the graphical representation outside of Stata, that would also be fine. </p>
