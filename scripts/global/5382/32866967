<p>I am creating a database where every month there will be a new value  entered with the value of the month for graphing purposes. (2 new rows?)</p>  <p>These values need to be recorded with all the other data in the table.</p>  <p><strong>The question is is it better to use something like MongoDB which I don't know but could learn or stick with MySQL which i do.</strong> From the perspective of MySQL the table could start to get very big in say 5 to 10 years with 120 to 240 new rows to a table with possible 1,000,000 entries.</p>  <p>Perhaps there is a straight forward design but i am a bit of a newbie to database design..</p>
