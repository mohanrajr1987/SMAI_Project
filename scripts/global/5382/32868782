<p>We have a graph G and wish to add edges between every vertex pair, that are as light as possible without affecting the minimum spanning tree. Given the minimum spanning tree and a pair of vertices, how would one compute the weight of the lightest edge that can be added between them without affecting the MST?</p>  <p>Thought adding an edge that is heavier than every other edge the two vertices have would work but it appears to be erroneous in trials I've conducted.</p>
