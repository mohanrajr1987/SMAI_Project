<p>I want to know what is the unit for Y axis in MIB Graph like in the picture. The picture used "snmpInBandwidth" as the pool data. How about the unit for another pool data, e.g. cpu, memory pool? <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/K3ZCD.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/K3ZCD.png" alt="snmpInBandwidth"></a></p>
