<p>To begin with, I understand there are other modules such as Requests that would be better suited and simpler to use, but I want to use the socket module to better understand HTTP.</p>  <p>I have a simple script that does the following:</p>  <p>Client ---> HTTP Proxy ---> External Resource (GET Google.com)</p>  <p>I am able to connect to the  HTTP proxy alright, but when I send the GET request headers for google.com to the proxy, it doesn't serve me any response at all.</p>  <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python import socket import sys    headers = """GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n Host: google.com\r\n\r\n"""    socket = socket  host = "165.139.179.225" #proxy server IP port = 8080              #proxy server port  try:     s = socket.socket()     s.connect((host,port))     s.send(("CONNECT {0}:{1} HTTP/1.1\r\n" + "Host: {2}:    {3}\r\n\r\n").format(socket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname()),1000,port,host))     print s.recv(1096)     s.send(headers)     response = s.recv(1096)    print response    s.close() except socket.error,m:    print str(m)    s.close()    sys.exit(1) </code></pre>
