<p>I'm guessing this is a basic networking/proxy related query... I'm new to all these things  </p>  <p>Yesterday I was trying to experiment with proxies..<br> I went to the network configuration settings of my <code>Firefox</code> browser and in the <code>manual proxy settings</code> section, I entered a proxy site (<code>german-proxy.de</code>) and set port as 80.<br> After that I applied those settings<br> And then when I entered a url lets say <code>stackoverflow.com</code> on the address bar, It took me to the homepage of the proxy site (<code>german-proxy.de</code>) instead of stackoverflow.<br> I tried with several other sites but all of them led to the same proxy homepage.  </p>  <p>Could anyone please explain why is this happening? And what exactly is happening when I set proxy configuration to a website? I'm guessing this phenomenon doesn't limit only to firefox browser.</p>  <p>edit: A small mention - the proxy site which I've mentioned is a gylpe proxy as it says on their website.</p>
