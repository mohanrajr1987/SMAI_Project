<p><strong>This is my situation:</strong></p>  <p>I have a server with connected vpn clients. These clients get an IP through first come, first serve.  On both the server and the clients runs Apache.  On the server users log on (apache/php session) and get a web page with statistics of their own vpn client.</p>  <p><strong>I would like to achieve the following</strong></p>  <p>The clients can access their own vpn client after log on through proxy-ing.</p>  <p>So:</p>  <pre><code>browser --&gt; http myServer --&gt; http vpnClient </code></pre>  <p>But only if the authentication on the server was correct.</p>  <p>I was looking through the possibility of mod_rewrite so the IP of the client can be put in, but this seems insecure to me as the client IP should be passed in the URL...</p>  <p>I know this could be achieved by using something like curl, but this takes time and resources to process, that should not be necessary?</p>
