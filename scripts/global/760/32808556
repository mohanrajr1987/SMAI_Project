<p>I'm hosting a static site on some VPS and would like to move everything over to S3 and use static website hosting. Currently I'm proxying /api requests using nginx to my API server like so:</p>  <pre><code>www.website.com/api/get-location -&gt; api.website.com/api/get-location </code></pre>  <p>I'm doing this because I have Facebook login on the client and need the same domain to have the cookie transfer to my API for login etc.</p>  <p>I can see that it's possible to create a Route which changes /api to api.website.com/api but it needs to be proxied to maintain the same URL <code>(browser will see a request to www.website.com/api being made)</code></p>
