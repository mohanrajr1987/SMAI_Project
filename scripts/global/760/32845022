<p>I need to build a <code>server</code> and a <code>client</code> that can exchange data in real time with a company's proxy between them. No one has the authorisation to amend the proxy's configuration (in order to allow the <code>WebSocket</code> protocol). </p>  <p>I would need a fallback technology such as <code>long-polling</code>.</p>  <p>Example: client is a user's PC employee. He needs to exchange data with the server, located in the cloud and separated by company's proxy.</p>  <p>Ideally, I would use <code>WebSocket</code> with <code>SSL</code>, but I know some proxies are not configured for <code>WebSocket</code> messages and thus could reject the connection.</p>  <p>The app would therefore switch to another <code>push</code> technology such as <code>long-polling</code>, increasing the chances of getting a successful connection (is 100% guaranteed with proxies? Giving that there are several types of proxies...)</p>  <p>Are there any libraries/frameworks proposing such features?</p>
