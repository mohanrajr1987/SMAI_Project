<p>I have developed a simple console application that uses Sockets to connect to an online server.</p>  <p>Every thing works fine in my dev lab, where I have a direct internet connection.</p>  <p>On most of my client sites, all internet traffic MUST go through a proxy - this stops my app from working. </p>  <p>What do i need to modify in my code to make it work for both proxy and non-proxy environments?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
