<p>im new to stackoverflow, so if i make a mistake im sorry.</p>  <p>I have to write a python script which collects some data with Elasticsearch and then write the data to a database. I am struggling collecting the data with elasticsearch, because the company i work is behind a proxy.</p>  <p>The script works without a proxy.. but i dont know how to pass down the proxy settings to Elasticsearch.</p>  <p>following code works without a proxy:</p>  <pre><code>es = Elasticsearch(['https://user:password@logs.net/elasticsearch']) res = es.search(index=index, body=request, search_type="count") </code></pre>  <p>i tried the following when i am behind the proxy:</p>  <pre><code>es = Elasticsearch(['https://user:password@logs.net/elasticsearch'], _proxy = 'http://proxy.org', _proxy_headers = {'basic_auth': 'user:pw'}) res = es.search(index=index, body=request, search_type="count") return res </code></pre>  <p>Does anyone know the keywords which i have to pass down Elasticsearch so it uses the proxy?</p>  <p>any help would be nice.</p>  <p>thanks.</p>
