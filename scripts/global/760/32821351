<p>I am using grunt-connect-proxy to redirect urls to nginx and I need to be able to rewrite hostname in the url as well.</p>  <p>I need that my original url <a href="http://localhost:9001" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:9001</a> rewrites to <a href="https://staging.domain.com" rel="nofollow">https://staging.domain.com</a>.</p>  <p>Right now I am able to make teh redirect but my reverse proxy take the original url (localhost) and this incorrectly handles the request.</p>  <p>Is it possible to do such rewrite? I tired using rewrite but no luck:</p>  <pre><code>proxies: [{                 context: "/uaa/oauth/authorize",                 changeOrigin: true,                 https: true,                 host: "staging.domain.com",                 hostRewrite: "staging.domain.com"                 rewrite: {                     '^http://localhost:9001' : 'https://staging.domain.com'                 }              } </code></pre>
