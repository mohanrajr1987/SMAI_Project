<p>I am trying to make HTTP requests via the WebClient class and am having issues making actual connections.</p>  <p>Ultimately I end up with this error message:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Error: ConnectFailure (A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not properly respond after a period of time, or established connection failed because connected host has failed to respond.)</p> </blockquote>  <p>I know for a fact that the issue is caused by the network setup, which has a proxy set up. I have tried using a variety of methods to retrieve the proxy settings - however proxy settings are retrieved via Windows' <strong>Automatically detect settings</strong> tickbox in Internet Options.</p>  <p>I know what the proxy address is, and I know it works because when I hardcode my WebClient to use a proxy, in this case, 192.168.1.10:8080, it works as intended. This software is intended to be used outside this location but also needs to work in this particular network environment, hence why I'm looking for other ways to detect the proxy settings.</p>  <p>I've tried to answer my own question with various search queries, however I've been unsuccessful with the various methods:</p>  <ul> <li>Setting the WebClient's proxy directly with WebRequest.GetSystemWebProxy();</li> <li>Setting WebRequest.DefaultWebProxy with the above (which seems redundant)</li> <li>Using the deprecated WebProxy.GetDefaultProxy() (undesirable)</li> <li>Trying to play around with <a href="http://wpad/wpad.dat" rel="nofollow">http://wpad/wpad.dat</a></li> </ul>  <p>I've read the wpad.dat file simply in Notepad and found that it does contain the proxy address and it may very well be the solution. However I have not found a non-hacky way of implementing it correctly and would like some advice on this, or if this is not the way to go, the alternative.</p>  <p>Some additional information that may be useful: I'm developing using C# Mono (a .NET 3.5 equivalent version) writing a standalone executable. App.configs are not applicable.</p>  <p>Any help is much appreciated, thanks.</p>
