<p>There are some websites that I can not access directly, so I have to use a proxy server which is actually remotely in another country that I can access with VPN.</p>  <p>In my mac, I tried to use "System Preference" -> "Network" -> "Advanced..." -> "Proxies", and select "Automatic Proxy Configuration", and here is my pac file:</p>  <pre><code>function FindProxyForURL(url, host) {     if (shExpMatch(url, '*slideshare.net/*')) return 'PROXY proxy_server:80';     if (shExpMatch(url, '*twitter.com/*')) return 'PROXY proxy_server:80';     if (shExpMatch(url, '*youtube.com/*')) return 'PROXY proxy_server:80';     return 'DIRECT'; } </code></pre>  <p>And then I found <a href="http://www.slideshare.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.slideshare.net</a> worked perfectly, but for <a href="https://www.twitter.com" rel="nofollow">https://www.twitter.com</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com</a>, I still can not access them. So it seem PAC file can only support http, but not https?</p>  <p>And if I changed to use "System Preference" -> "Network" -> "Advanced..." -> "Proxies" -> "Web Proxy (HTTP)" and "Secure Web Proxy (HTTPS)", and filled my proxy server there, it worked perfectly for all those 3 websites. But that will make all traffics go through the proxy server which is not what I want, I still have a lot of local websites that I want to access directly.</p>  <p>So any ideas to fix this issue? Any help will be highly appreciated! Thanks!</p>
