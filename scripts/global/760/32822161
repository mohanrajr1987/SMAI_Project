<p>I am trying to run lynx in my perl cgi script so it extracts some text from wen page. I am doing it as in the following manner in my script,</p>  <p><code>lynx -source -preparsed "$url" &gt; data.txt</code></p>  <p>But I get the following error in my server's error_log:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Looking up www.xyz.com</p>      <p>Making HTTP connection to www.xyz.com Alert!:</p>      <p>Unable to connect to remote host.</p>      <p>lynx: Can't access startfile xyz.com</p> </blockquote>  <p>I get the same error when I tried to execute lynx from the command line for root user. But the perl script and the lynx command work normally when I run it in normal user.Our newtwork consists of proxy settings which I had done in <code>/etc/lynx-site.cfg</code> as <code>PROTOCOL_proxy="http://proxy.abcdxyz.ac.in:8080"</code>.But it hasnot given any result.</p>
