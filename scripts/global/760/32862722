<p>we have a nginx server running Kibana on 80. We have also setup Kibana for our staging environments. So if we hit <a href="https://mykibana.mycompany.com/staging" rel="nofollow">https://mykibana.mycompany.com/staging</a> it should hit staging kibana server listening on 80.</p>  <p>We tried all sorts of configurations to set this reverse proxy, but its not working. <a href="https://mykibana.mycompany.com/staging" rel="nofollow">https://mykibana.mycompany.com/staging</a> returns "Not Found"</p>  <p>Here is my config: <code>upstream staging_hosts {     server XX.YY.ZZ.WW; }</code></p>  <p><code>location @staging {          proxy_pass http://staging_hosts;          }</code></p>  <p>Can anyone help me out?</p>
