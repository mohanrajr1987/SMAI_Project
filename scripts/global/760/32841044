<p>I've a question. How can I config my nginx for redirecting from url started without hashtags to url started with hashtag. For example "/sign-in" redirect to "/#sign-in". Or "/admin/create" to "/#admin/create".<br> But I need exclude some addresses, for example, "/api" redirect to "<a href="http://someapi.com" rel="nofollow">http://someapi.com</a>".<br><br>  I use windows. Thanks!</p>
