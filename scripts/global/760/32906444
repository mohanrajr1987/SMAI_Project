<p>I want to monitor the traffic of my android phone using Charles 3.10.2. However I am getting sporadic handshake errors, i.e., the server responds with <code>400 Bad Request</code> when doing </p>  <pre><code>CONNECT HOSTNAME:443 HTTP/1.1 </code></pre>  <p>The following failure reason is shown when this happens:</p>  <pre><code>SSLHandshake: Client requested protocol SSLv3 not enabled or not supported </code></pre>  <p>The strange thing is, that some requests to the same host work while others don't.</p>  <p>Any ideas how to fix this? I already installed the root cert of charles on the phone. Thanks in advance for helpful answers.</p>
