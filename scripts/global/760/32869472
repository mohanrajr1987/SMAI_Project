<p>I'm using curl against a target site that has a quota of page views per IP, e.g. 5000 page views per IP per day. Now I'm trying to get more by switching IP addresses.</p>  <p>I'm using some proxy IP addresses for $10 / month. So I added them to PHP curl via the CURLOPT_PROXY option, but somehow the target site is still able to detect my original IP and doesn't give new quotas for the proxy IPs.</p>  <p>I tried to curl some other sites with the proxy on and it's working properly.</p>  <p>Why is it that the target site is able to detect my original IP even when I use a proxy with curl in PHP? How to make my original IP completely hidden in this sense?</p>  <p>This seems also the case when I'm browsing sites through proxy but somehow they are still able to detect my local computer IP address.</p>  <p>Why is it like this? Is there something inherently impossible to hide IP via HTTP?</p>
