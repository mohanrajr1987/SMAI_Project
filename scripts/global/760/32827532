<p>I just installed Node.js and npm (version 4.1.1, Windows 7 64 bit).  When I try any npm command, I get a URI error list, similar to that given here: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24164136/error-running-npm-command">npm error question on SO</a> I see many people mentioning the proxy setting, but I cannot set the proxy in npm either; I get the same error for any npm command.  (My proxy settings appear to be correct in the .npmrc file in my user folder) I have re-installed Node.js (making sure to delete AppData/Roaming npm files as well), to no effect.  I am and administrator on this machine. </p>
