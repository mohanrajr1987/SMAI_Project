<p>I might be doing something wrong but I am unable to force grunt-contrib-proxy to do a simple redirect.</p>  <p>In my gruntfile.coffeee (yup coffeescript) I have the following server configuration:</p>  <pre><code> connect:         devserver:             options:                 port: 9001                 base: "./"             proxies: [{                 context: "/",                 host: 'dev.staging.com'                 changeOrigin: true             }] </code></pre>  <p>I also added: grunt.loadNpmTasks "grunt-connect-proxy"  and updated my task with "configureProxies:devserver"</p>  <p>I believe that this should redirect any call to dev.staging.com, so when I type in <a href="http://localhost:9001" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:9001</a> i should be redirected to url <a href="http://dev.staging.com" rel="nofollow">http://dev.staging.com</a></p>  <p>However it doesn't seem like proxy is workign at all. I have tried multiple configurations (even with rewrite) but still no luck.</p>  <p>I might be doing something wrong but i can't figure what...</p>  <p>Grunt compiles and runs the task properly.</p>
