<p>I have a huge list of proxies from <a href="http://orcahub.com/proxy-lists/" rel="nofollow">http://orcahub.com/proxy-lists/</a> </p>  <p>For example: "202.29.97.2:3128"</p>  <p>I am trying to make all outbound requests (on port 80) go through a random proxy </p>  <p>I already use the following to change outbound request to a different IP on my machine, but is it possible to do it through a proxy using IPtables as well?</p>  <p>Here is the code I use to change IPs</p>  <pre><code>iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -j SNAT --to-source x.x.x.x </code></pre>  <p>I tried changing x.x.x.x with the proxy, but to no avail. </p>  <p>Is this even possible?</p>  <p>I have also tried</p>  <pre><code>iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -j SNAT --to-source x.x.x.x:proxyip:proxyport </code></pre>  <p>And then another question, if this is possible can I make it rotate through proxies in a txt file?</p>  <p>Thank you!</p>
