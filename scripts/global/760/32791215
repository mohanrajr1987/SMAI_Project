<p>I'm in an environment that uses complex proxy settings and uses .pac file to describe/resolve them. I want to setup some VM's and docker containers on this environment mainly based on ubuntu. The typical "system --> preferences --> network proxy --> apply system wide" answer doesn't help a lot because I don't have access to the UI. Ideally a solution would apply really system-wide i.e. work with <code>curl</code>, <code>wget</code>, <code>apt-get</code>, <code>pip</code> and <code>maven</code>. Is there such solution?</p>
