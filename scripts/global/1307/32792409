<p>I have a DataGrid, I'm using C# WPF. I want to find a way so that when a user double clicks a cell that is in my very last column that a Textbox pops up and displays all of the content in that specific cell. Is there anyway to possibly do this? You would think there would be a way I could just be like </p>  <p><code>if (myDataGridObj.cellselected[i] is in this Column)</code></p>  <pre><code>{    do stuff } </code></pre>  <p>I basically want to give back the content of that specific cell when a user double clicks on that specific cell. I don't wwant anything to pop up though unless that specific cell falls under a certain column name and is clicked. I  only want to give back that cell's content.</p>
