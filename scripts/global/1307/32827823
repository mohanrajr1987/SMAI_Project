<p>I know this will give you a total row count <code>int rowCount = myGrid.Items.Count;</code> but I am after a count of each <code>Location</code> in the grid.  For example, my sample data structure is like so, and I need a count of each location in the grid:</p>  <pre><code>Location --- Assigned F            Red F            Red F            Red F            Red R            Blue R            Blue L            Green </code></pre>  <p>And my desired count would be F = 4, R = 2, L = 1</p>
