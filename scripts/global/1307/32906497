<p>I am making a WPF GUI where I have a datagrid with several columns. I would like to make cell type in one of the columns vary depending on the selection in another cell. A cell would need to swap between Text and ComboBox.</p>  <p>In the image below the datagrid can be seen. I want functionality where when user checks the IsConstant checkbox, then he can enter a constant numeric value, otherwise he would be presented with a ComboBox from which he could select an option he likes. The checkbox column is bound to a bool value in codebehind.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ih7fP.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ih7fP.png" alt="Data Grid"></a></p>  <p>However I am not sure how and If this is possible. Any suggestions are welcome. Thanks. </p>
