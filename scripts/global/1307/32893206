<p>I'm using vb.net framework 4.5 and WPF project.</p>  <p>I have a button, the function adds a certain product info to a datagrid. In my vb code file I set a product class</p>  <pre><code>Public Class MyProduct     Public Property ItemNumber As String     Public Property ItemDescription As String     Public Property ItemUnitPrice As Double     Public Property ItemQty As Integer End Class </code></pre>  <p>The button touchdown event </p>  <pre><code>Private Sub Button_TouchDown(sender As Object, e As TouchEventArgs)          Dim dmb As New MyProduct         dmb.ItemNumber = "abc001"         dmb.ItemDescription = "bla bla bla"         dmb.ItemQty = 1         dmb.ItemUnitPrice = 123.45          MyDataGrid.Items.Add(dmb)  End Sub </code></pre>  <p>Currently, if I tap multiple times of this button, the data grid will add multiple duplicated rows for same product. My goal is when multiple same product add to datagrid, only one row shows and each additional tap/click action on the same button will only increase the ItemQty number.  </p>  <p>How can I do that? Thanks!</p>
