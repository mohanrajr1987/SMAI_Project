<p>Can EasyUi Datagrid do client side action like Bootstrap DataTable? Especially for sorting, filtering, and pagination.</p>  <p>I've created datagrid pagination with server side code on EasyUI and I want to add filtering feature. But I think it will be much 'where' on the query. Since the data is not so big, I want to load all data and doing it locally like Bootstrap DataTable did. </p>  <p>How to create fully client side DataGrid EasyUI with sorting, Filtering and pagination feature?</p>
