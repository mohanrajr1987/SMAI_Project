<p>I'd like to style the row (it's cells) from within LoadingRow event. The event gives me the DataGridRow and the Item. I tried to find the cells as descripted here (answer by denis morozov): <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3671003/wpf-how-to-get-a-cell-from-a-datagridrow">WPF - How to get a cell from a DataGridRow?</a></p>  <p>But it does not work for me. Maybe it's because of the virtualization of the DataGrid. But not all cells get styled. Especially when scrolling.</p>  <pre><code>private void dataGridDocument_LoadingRow(object sender, DataGridRowEventArgs e) {   DataGridRow row = e.Row;   MyItem item = row.Item as MyItem;    ...? } </code></pre>  <p>I know that I could style the cells using XAML + converters, but I hate the idea to check the formating criterias for every property. Let's assume you have Forecolor, Backcolor and you have 3 columns, then you need to evaluate the conditions 6 times. I would prefer to evaluate the formating conditions only one time and then apply all necessary styling at once.</p>
