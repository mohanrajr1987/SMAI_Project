<p>Do you know any javascript datagrid libraries that are like jqgrid but more modern and updated? Thank you for your help. I found angular ui-grid but I don't want to make a quick decision without considering other libraries. That will allow me to pass it variable column names and data. I want to be able to pass to this library columns of different length and names along with data that might contain null. </p>
