<p>I want to do the following all in Code behind: I have a DataGrid in Silverlight, which I want the user to edit the value in it. The ItemsSource is a List> object that will be populated at runtime. </p>  <p>It seems that DataGrid's ItemsSource doesn't accept List> data type. And since I can only populate the Dictionary at runtime, my first question is how should I convert the Dictionary to a POCO object. I tried the dynamic type, but for some reason the DataGrid doesn't recognize it.</p>  <p>And for some reason, it seems that if I set a Dictionary to the DataGrid's ItemSource, the datagrid can't be edited. Can somebody tell me why?</p>  <p>Thanks,</p>
