<p>If you start my app you see a list of products, and if you select an item I open a product page. </p>  <p>Since some of my customers use the app always with the same product, I added a "add to homescreen" option to each product page. This creates a shortcut on the launcher. I did this according as described in this issue:</p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8810931/how-can-i-have-a-home-screen-shortcut-launch-a-dialog">How can I have a home screen shortcut launch a dialog?</a> </p>  <p>The shortcut works great, but I noticed that my app now has a "widget", that the user can add to the home screen from the installed app launcher. Doing so does not create a valid shortcut, because the information which product should be opened is not set this way.</p>  <p>I don't want this widget there in the first place, is there a way to create a shortcut without also adding the widget?</p>
