<p>I have read many questions and tried without any success but it seems to be impossible to activate an widget/brodcast receiver that is disabled on the manifest:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;receiver android:name=".widget.WidgetProvider"         android:enabled="false"&gt;  ....     &lt;/receiver&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Using this code doesnt work: </p>  <pre><code>    ComponentName component = new ComponentName(this, WidgetProvider.class);     PackageManager pm = getPackageManager();     pm.setComponentEnabledSetting(             component,             PackageManager.COMPONENT_ENABLED_STATE_ENABLED,             PackageManager.DONT_KILL_APP); </code></pre>  <p>I read in my places that it should work but it doesnt! </p>  <p>I have even trying testing the component state:</p>  <pre><code>    int nComponentEnabledState = pm.getComponentEnabledSetting(component);     Log.i("Widget", "Widget Component State: " + nComponentEnabledState); </code></pre>  <p>Which return 1 which means it is active but the widget doesn't appear on the widget list which is driving me crazy! What am i doing wrong?</p>
