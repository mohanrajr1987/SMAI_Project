<p>I looked up <a href="https://github.com/leolin310148/ShortcutBadger/blob/master/README.md" rel="nofollow">this library</a> which lets the developer overlay the app icon with a badge. Can it be used to overlay a widget? Is there any other coffee example that lets you overlay a widget with badge as simply as this? Thanks</p>
