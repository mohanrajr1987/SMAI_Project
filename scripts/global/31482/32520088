<p>After updating studio to SDK 23 it is not showing any auto suggestions inside widget layouts.</p>  <p>Like   <code>android.support.v7.widget.CardView</code> or <code>android.support.design.widget.CoordinatorLayout</code> inside these layouts not getting any auto suggestions but after closing the widgets auto suggestion is working properly.</p>  <p>Why this is happening? I tried deleting cache, built files updating gradle files again but nothing working. </p>  <p>Is it issue with 23?</p>  <p>For more understanding check these two images:  </p>  <p>1) <strong>when my Relative Layout is inside of card view widget it is not    showing any suggestion on Ctrl+space</strong></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Mcpdo.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Mcpdo.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p><strong>2) But outside of card widget layout it is showing suggestion on Ctrl+space</strong></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/h98Ov.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/h98Ov.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
