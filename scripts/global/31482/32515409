<p>guys.</p>  <p>I'm making widget for some app, which places on home screen of phone. In Configure Activity I want to add overlay option - checkbox. But I'm not sure if I appwidgets could use overlay.</p>  <p>Could you tell me, please, can appwidget use overlay (be shown not only on homescreen, but on the top of another apps) and if so - how can I implement overlay for android app widget?</p>  <p>P.S.: I'm wannabe android junior dev, and would be glad to take source code as an example. </p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
