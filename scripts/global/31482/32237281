<p>I have a motorola x device and created an android application, now I am trying to update widget preview image but even changing the previewImage in appwidget-provider, image is still showing older one not updating it.  From my experiments I tried-  1. Deleting image from res folder.  2. Created folder with different resolution option but no luck. 3. One solution that is working - changing the name of receiver in manifest file but I don't want to do that.</p>  <p>Do anyone came under this problem with motorola x device.</p>  <p>Any solution will be of great help. Thanks in advance.</p>
