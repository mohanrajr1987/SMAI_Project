<p>I'm making an app in Google maps and we randomly got this weird widget at some point. The widget looks like the standard android 'settings' 3 vertical dots, and is a semi translucent white widget that can be dragged around. Anybody know what it is/where it could be from? It looks out of place in our app. It literally randomly appeared while we were playing around with debugging... Nothing we added explicitly creates a widget either. <a href="http://imgur.com/XgUJukQ" rel="nofollow" title="widget">widget</a></p>
