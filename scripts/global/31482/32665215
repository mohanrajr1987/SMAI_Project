<p>I have AlarmManager set up to fire every minute. However, I only need it when phone is active. I want to turn off all updates when phone goes to sleep. I am not sure what the default behavior of AlarmManager and widgets in general is when phone goes to sleep. But I noticed that my battery goes down when in sleep mode. Hence, i believe its the widget thats bringing it down.</p>  <p>So, if AlarmManager and other broadcasts keep firing by default, how can I turn these updates off in sleep mode and then turn them back on when phone resumes active mode?</p>
