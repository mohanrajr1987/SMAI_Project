<p>I set up a default Google maps project.</p>  <p>In the <code>Main Activity</code>, the layout that is being referenced is <code>activity_maps.xml</code></p>  <p>This layout contains a fragment, called <code>map</code> which is referenced in <code>MainActivity</code> as well.</p>  <p>I want to add widgets to this layout, inside the fragment I presume, probably a drop-down menu for selecting areas on the map.</p>  <p>How do I do this?</p>  <p>When I try to render <code>activity_maps</code> I get a blank screen, because previously I referenced the fragment to <code>activity_maps</code> and caused a StackOverflow... whoops!</p>  <p>So, after that problem us fixed (I tried refreshing), I still don't think I can simply add widgets, can I?</p>
