<p>I have some rules which defines algorithm for XML validation. I should create XSD from this rules. How to create XSD with Ruby using this rules and data from DB? What tools would you recommend?</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>  <p>There is no need to create XSD when we have specific validation rules. We can just use parser nokogiri, libxml, ox and validate rule one by one.</p>
