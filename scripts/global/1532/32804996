<p>As far as I understand, it is better to use Spring <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/20900801/1651233">versionless xsd</a>.</p>  <p>However, when using Intellij the validation is done based on a random xsd file. When adding the version to the xsd file everything works as expected.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/kwRnw.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/kwRnw.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>As you can see I use Spring 4.2.1 but Intellij chooses 3.1 version.</p>  <p>Is it a bug (or not yet implemented feature) in Intellij? Is there a workaround?</p>
