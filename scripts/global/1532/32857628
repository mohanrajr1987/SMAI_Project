<p>I just tried to understand these 3 attributes in <code>XSD</code> definition. But not sure if it is right . Please help to correct me .If it is wrong. Thanks</p>  <p>Compared to the <code>Java Class</code> definition with XSD definition.</p>  <p>The <code>targetNamespace</code> just like package definition of Java Class. Indicating all the members including fields , properties and Class are belong to the <code>targetNamespace</code>.</p>  <p>And we need import some class members from other class for consuming them. So That is the <code>xmlns</code> and <code>xmlns:somePreFix</code> work for. and <code>xmlns</code> is just a default one. </p>
