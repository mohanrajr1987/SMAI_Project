<p>I would like to know if anybody knows if there's an XSLT that will produce a table with information from an XSD (an xsd that references multiple other xsds using xsd:import).</p>  <p>I would like to have a table that produces the complete structure of an element (that you need to indicate):</p>  <p><b>Element - Type - Extra Info</b><br/> _Book - BookType<br/> __  Title - xs:string<br/> ___  Author - AuthorType<br/> ____    BookerPriceWinner - xs:boolean - default="false"<br/> ____    Name - xs:string - required<br/></p>  <p>I've been searching and have found Oxygen and XmlSpy being able to produce a good html doc. xs3p also is producing good html. However, I have multiple xsd files and don't want separate files for each set of types, I want to have one table containing all related elements, with an indent reflecting the tree structure.</p>
