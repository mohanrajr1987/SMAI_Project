<p>I have generated Haskell data types from XSD using the XsdToHaskell tool embedded in the HaXml library. And now I have a bunch of data types and seem-to-be parsers for those datatypes. But the main function in the output file (<code>elementPlans</code>) is returning <code>XMLParser PlansType</code> (<code>PlansType</code> is the type of the root element in XML) and I have no idea how to parse the XML file having this parser.</p>  <p>Here's <a href="http://pastebin.com/m6Qzsd8t" rel="nofollow">Plans.hs</a> (output of XmlToHaskell), <a href="http://pastebin.com/SH8vZfe3" rel="nofollow">XSD</a> and <a href="http://pastebin.com/7zQFteZJ" rel="nofollow">XML</a>.</p>
