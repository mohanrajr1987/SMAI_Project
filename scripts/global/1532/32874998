<p>So I am using <code>Visual Studio 2005</code> for this. I need to generate a schema from a .dll file which used to work in the past, but now when doing:</p>  <pre><code>xsd CustomDll.dll /type: CustomClass </code></pre>  <p>I always get the annoying error:</p>  <pre><code>Error: There was an error processing 'CustomDll.dll'   - Unable to load one or more of the requested types. Retrieve the LoaderExceptions property for more information.   </code></pre>  <p>I tried searching the internet, but none of the things I found helped me.  </p>  <p>I don't even know exactly what for what issue to search for ? What are the possible causes for this ? Is there a way to retrieve <code>LoaderExceptions</code> property in <code>VS2005</code> ?  </p>  <p>Any answer will be helpfull.</p>  <p>edit:  </p>  <p>I used Fusion Logs, and this is what I get from one of the log files (the rest are all successful) :</p>  <pre><code>*** Assembly Binder Log Entry  (10/1/2015 @ 5:30:56 PM) ***  The operation failed. Bind result: hr = 0x80070002. The system cannot find the file specified.
