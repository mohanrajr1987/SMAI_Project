<p>I use Visual Studio 2013 and use XSD Schema Definition Tool (xsd.exe) of Microsoft SDK to generate class automatically from xml. I have no experience using xsd.exe and I have read some related cases here in SO, but none of them provide hint how to solve my issue.</p>  <p>Following are the steps I did:</p>  <ol> <li>xsd MyFile1.xml MyFile2.xml /o:.  ==> MyFile1.xsd and MyFile2.xsd are created well.</li> <li>xsd MyFile.xsd MyFile2.xsd /namespace:MyProject.FromXsd /c /o:.</li> </ol>  <p>I get following warnings on 2nd step:</p>  <p><strong><em>Schema validation wanring: The global element 'NewDataSet' has already been declared. Warning: Schema could not be validated. Class generation may fail or may produce incorrect results. Writing file '.\MyFile1_MyFile2.cs'</em></strong></p>  <p>In the automatically generated .cs file I can see there is only one NewDataSet is declared as public partial class which <strong>contains only an array of object of MyFile1</strong> and there is <strong>no array of object of MyFile2</strong>. But I expect there is also an array of object of MyFile2, since if I <strong>separately generate</strong> the cs code, I can see an array of object of MyFile2 in public partial class NewDataSet.</p>  <p>Following is code snippet .cs file that is generated automatically from MyFile1.xsd and MyFile2.xsd together.</p>  <pre><code>/// &lt;remarks/&gt; [System.CodeDom.Compiler.GeneratedCodeAttribute("xsd", "4.0.30319.33440")] [System.SerializableAttribute()] [System.Diagnostics.DebuggerStepThroughAttribute()] [System.ComponentModel.DesignerCategoryAttribute("code")] [System.Xml.Serialization.XmlTypeAttribute(AnonymousType = true)] [System.Xml.Serialization.XmlRootAttribute(Namespace = "", IsNullable = false)] public partial class NewDataSet {      private DataFile1[] itemsField;      /// &lt;remarks/&gt;     [System.Xml.Serialization.XmlElementAttribute("DataFile1")]     public DataFile1[] Items     {         get         {             return this.itemsField;         }         set         {             this.itemsField = value;         }     } } </code></pre>  <p>My target is to generate a CS code from some XSDs in a namespace, since I have a bunch of XSDs</p>  <p>Please tell me how to solve this issue and reach my target at best.</p>  <p>Thank you in advance.</p>
