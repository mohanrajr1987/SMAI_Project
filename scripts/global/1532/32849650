<p>I am currently using gSoap to bind my XML data.  Whenever I built my project, my output starts with several lines of "Writing file ---.h" where --- is one of the XML files in source directory.  How can I bypass this step?</p>  <p>I've searched high and low in the property manager -> microsoft.cpp.win32.user and I know that the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/x6c1kb0s(v=vs.100).aspx" rel="nofollow" title="XSD Data Generator tool">XSD Data Generator tool</a> is to blame.  How can I disable it?</p>
