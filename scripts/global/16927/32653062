<p>I'm building a web crawler which uses JSoup for parsing the HTML Document. Currently I'm using the <strong><em>getElementById()</em></strong> and the <strong><em>text()</em></strong> methods to get the text for 3 or 4 fields. But it seems to me that every time the HTML structure changes, I'll need to change my code to adapt to it.</p>  <p>Is there a better and more robust way to get the required fields?</p>
