<p>I'm super new to DOM but I see it's very powerful and might work for what I'm trying to achieve.</p>  <p>Basically, I want to fetch images from site and their corresponding ID's. Then I want to put each image with it's own ID in table, not just outputting them as text.</p>  <p>Currently my code looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php  // Include the php dom parser     include 'parser.php';  $url = 'https://www.example.com/images.php?p=1';  $html = file_get_html($url);  foreach($html-&gt;find('img') as $element) {     echo $element-&gt;src, '&lt;br /&gt;'; }  foreach($html-&gt;find('a') as $element) {     echo $element-&gt;ID, '&lt;br /&gt;'; } ?&gt;  </code></pre>  <p>and the example output is:</p>  <p>img1.jpg<br /> img2.jpg<br /> img3.jpg<br /> id1<br /> id2<br /> id3<br /></p>  <p>I want to associate the rows in a tables (img1 with id1, img2 with id2, etc...) and output the image next to the ID in table.</p>  <p>How would I do that? Any help is appreciated.</p>
