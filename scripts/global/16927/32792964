<p>I am using Simple HTML Dom to parse some HTML. For the most part it seems to work wonderfully for my purposes for most situations. However, I am not sure if it is the right tool or I don't understand enough to make it work in this situation. I was curious if anyone had suggestions for this?</p>  <pre><code>&lt;td class='label'&gt; Color &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class='value'&gt; Blue &lt;/td&gt; </code></pre>  <p>So if I wanted to get the inner text for the <code>&lt;td class='value'&gt;</code> of the Color for instance I would do something like this...</p>  <pre><code>foreach($html-&gt;find('td[class=value]') as $element) {    print $element-&gt;innertext; } </code></pre>  <p>So my struggle is if I want to get the value of the color blue and there are situations where it won't fall in the below order, there is no defining attribute accept the innertext of the class=‘label’, in this example “Color”. </p>  <pre><code>&lt;td class='label'&gt; Built &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class='value'&gt; 1985 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td class='label'&gt; Color &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class='value'&gt; Blue &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td class='label'&gt; Weight &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class='value'&gt; 30 &lt;/td&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I considered attempting to use a basic if/else statement but it has not seemed to work well.</p>  <p>Is there an ideal way to handle this, what would be the best way to structure this so if the <strong><em><code>class=‘label’ = Color</code></em></strong> I would call the innertext of the following element <code>class=‘value’</code> to get blue regardless of which order or where on the page this falls.</p>  <p>Can this be done with this tool?</p>
