<p>I'm developing an Classic ASP code that read a external websites and parse it via HTMLDocument interface Object ( "HTMLFILE" Object) to navigate contents via DOM structure. </p>  <pre><code>Set objHtml = CreateObject("HTMLFILE") Set objExt = Server.CreateObject("MSXML2.ServerXMLHTTP.6.0")  objExt.Open "GET", "http://externalwebsite.com/", false objExt.Send  objHtml.write objExt.responseText </code></pre>  <p>But there are some pages that throw me to an error at last line code "objHtml.write ...." :</p>  <blockquote>   <p>'htmlfile error 80070057 Invalid Argument.'</p> </blockquote>  <p>After that i've done a lot of research over the net (nothing really useful found here), and a lot testings inside my code (a lot of time wasted because it's a huge html source to process), i have discovered that there's something about some Html Tags (for example, "Iframe" Tags). </p>  <p>I'm want to avoid remove it manually via RegEx or via string processing to optimize server processing time, and for a writing an clean "done it right" code, discovering why that error happen and what to do to avoid or solve it.</p>  <p>Because ClassicASP is Old, there is no documentation available on the net and there is no description on why this error happens, i'm depending on someone else's knowledge on documentation or testings to help me.</p>  <p>Thank you all.</p>
