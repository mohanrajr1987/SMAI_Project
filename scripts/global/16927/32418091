<p>So I have a page with the following HTML, its obviously very poorly done but I need to run some automation and part of that includes getting the date below.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td class="bold"&gt;         Last Login      &lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td colspan="3" class="usual"&gt;         4/1/2011 at 07:01:11 AM         &lt;/td&gt;   &lt;/tr&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Ideally I'd like to extract the contents of the second <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> and then convert it to Unix time but just grabbing it will be enough.</p>  <p>I was thinking this could be done with regex but you would have to reiterate through it a couple times to pull the  contents. </p>
