<p>I am making an email template that can get responses without linking externally. Using java would get the email marked as spam, so I have been trying to use HTML and CSS.</p>  <p>Is it possible to get/store numerous responses from an HTML embedded email? In the perfect situation, the recipient would fill out the fields, hit submit (still in the email), and their responses would send to my database where I can parse them later. I was thinking it may be easier to embed a website in the email instead?</p>  <p>Any thoughts or suggestions?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
