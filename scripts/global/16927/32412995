<p>I want to parse all cities from a website (which seems to be encoded <code>&lt;meta charset="iso-8859-15" /&gt;</code>). Then I want to export them in CSV file in order to have them in Excel (Office for Mac 2016). I am using Simple HTML DOM Parser in my PHP script.</p>  <p>First, I coded a PHP script on PC with Windows. CSV file was OK and Excel recognized it correctly (Windows(ANSI) format). No problem here.</p>  <p>Nevertheless, it's a script I want to use on Windows and Mac. When I tested it on Mac, there were a lot of special characters inside. Here is an example of cities I got:</p>  <pre>  Paris 15&egrave;me  Brétigny-sur-Orge  Paris 19&egrave;me  Paris 5&egrave;me  Argenteuil  Saint-Mandé</pre>  <p>I do not understand why 'è' (<code>&amp;egrave;</code>) are in HTML format, while 'é' have good format.</p>  <p>Here is how I gather cities:</p>  <pre><code>$place = str_replace('  ','',$lbc-&gt;find('div[class="placement"]',0)-&gt;plaintext); </code></pre>  <p>To delete this coding problem, I tried to use html_entity_decode like this:</p>  <pre><code>$place = str_replace('','',html_entity_decode($lbc-&gt;find('div[class="placement"]',0)-&gt;plaintext)); </code></pre>  <p>which made the job for 'è', 'ê', BUT then 'é' characters which were OK are not anymore, they become <code>?</code>.</p>  <p>I do not see how to handle all this.</p>  <p>Other issue, when I try to import CSV file in Excel Mac 2016, it does not recognized format. I have to open the CSV with Sublime Text 2 in order to find the good format,then save and finally import it in Excel for Mac.</p>
