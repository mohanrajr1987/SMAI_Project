<p>It has come to my attention, during my experimentation that I am unable to parse the text received from request.get with either the htmlparser or htmlparser2 packages.</p>  <p>In comparison to https.request the string returned is not the same, line breaks wise. I am scarping a human readable page, and http.request handler is able to aggregate the data to match the server response in terms of outputting.</p>  <p>But with request.get I am receiving a response that is without line breaks. Therefore I can only assume I am not using a parsing package that is not support by requestjs, and am led to question:</p>  <p>What is the best way to actually parse out the HTML received from the reqeust.get and requst.post calls?</p>  <p>Thank You.</p>
