<p>I need to take with HTML page some of the data + pictures, which are enclosed in a tag. </p>  <p><strong>For example:</strong></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/9o5vS.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/9o5vS.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I need to take ONLY "New York", "12:25 pm", "75F","Cloudy" and pic cloud. Also I need to display these elements in a certain order. How I can do it? Thanks.</p>
