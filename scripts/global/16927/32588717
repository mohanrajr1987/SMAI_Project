<p>I am looking for a solution to parse html with Ruby. I need a solution similar to Apache Tika with an option to extract main content of any page, not just a particular web-site.</p>  <p>Examples. If that is a news article, I would be interested to extract an article with it's title form a page skipping the rest. If it's a StackOverflow question, I would only want title, question, replies. If it's a picture with a title, I would only keep title. </p>  <p>Being completely new to Ruby, I have looked at html parsing gems <a href="https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/categories/html_parsing" rel="nofollow">here</a> that included Nokogiri and others. But I would really appreciate directly pointing me out how do I do it if that's possible.</p>  <p>While alternative solutions are interesting, I would like to mention that I cannot use Apache Tika as an app, but only in a server mode, so it does not provide an option to extract main context. On the other hand, main code that used to call Tika is in Ruby, so I need Ruby solution.</p>
