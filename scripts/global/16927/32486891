<p>I would like to copy some discussion from gitter. E.g. this one <a href="https://gitter.im/numenta/public/archives/2015/08/19" rel="nofollow">2015/08/19 archive</a>. The problem is that simple ctrl+a and ctrl+c does not copy user names nor dates. Those information are included in the source code of the page. What is the most simple way of doing this? I prefer minimum working examples in python (with little explanation of code). Format could be e.g.:</p>  <pre><code>(DATE) USERNAME: MESSAGE </code></pre>  <p>Thank you very much</p>
