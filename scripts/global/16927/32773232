<p>In BeautifulSoup is it possible to select all instances of a tag 'li' whose Class has a specific value (= 'hidden') OR the Class attribute is not present at all? How would I write the findAll statement to achieve this?    I searched a lot but could not find a similar question.</p>  <p>The page I am trying to scrape has three types of 'li' tags:  </p>  <pre><code>li  (no class attribute)   li  (class = more  )   li  (class = hidden )    </code></pre>  <p>I want to pick all li tags that are of the 1st and 3rd type only. Is it possible in Beautiful soup to structure a <code>findAll('li'....)</code> that can achieve this? Thanks for your help!</p>
