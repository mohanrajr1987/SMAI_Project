<p>I am trying to add query timeouts to my system using JDBC. I am using the statement.setQueryTimeout function to do this. I know that this value is being set on statements I create using connection.createStatement, prepareStatement etc., as I have checked it using statement.getQueryTimeout. However, when testing with different databases (mysql, mssql, oracle and db2) and only mysql functions properly and all the others don't actually timeout</p>  <p>Any idea what could cause this? I am not sure why things would work at a high level for one setup but not the others, as I am using the standard provided drivers </p>
