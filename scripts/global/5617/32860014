<p>I'm trying to use Squirrel SQL to connect to spark-sql thriftserver using jdbc. For smaller resultset I'm getting the response. But for queries which are running for more than 30s, Squirrel throws the below exception:</p>  <pre><code>Error: org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransportException: java.net.SocketTimeoutException: Read timed out SQLState: 08S01 ErrorCode: 0 </code></pre>  <p>But when I check spark job page on port 4040 it shows that the query execution is successful. Even when I run the same query thru beeline I'm able to see the results. Looks like there is a client side timeout for squirrel sql. Kindly let me know how to increase the timeout parameter.</p>
