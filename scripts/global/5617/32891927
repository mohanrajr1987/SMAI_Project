<p>I can't get the right syntax - I'm trying to match on the column as an empty string, not a null. I've tried delimiting the string all number of ways, using single double quotes.</p>  <pre><code>containerRefNo = "\"\"";  ps = getConnection().prepareStatement(                 "delete from  inumber_join where container_no = ?"); </code></pre>  <p>The error I receive is</p>  <blockquote>   <p>You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MariaDB server version for the right syntax to use near 'from inumber_join where container_no = '""''</p> </blockquote>
