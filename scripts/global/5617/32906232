<p>I got a project to upgrade and it is using h2 DB with jdbc driver. During the build I have a systematic error on connection:</p>  <pre><code>Exception in thread "main" org.h2.jdbc.JdbcSQLException: Connection is broken: "Connection refused: connect" [90067-147] at org.h2.message.DbException.getJdbcSQLException(DbException.java:327) at org.h2.message.DbException.get(DbException.java:156) at org.h2.engine.SessionRemote.connectServer(SessionRemote.java:380) at org.h2.engine.SessionRemote.connectEmbeddedOrServer(SessionRemote.java:271) at org.h2.engine.SessionRemote.createSession(SessionRemote.java:265) at org.h2.jdbc.JdbcConnection.&lt;init&gt;(JdbcConnection.java:110) at org.h2.jdbc.JdbcConnection.&lt;init&gt;(JdbcConnection.java:94) at org.h2.Driver.connect(Driver.java:72) at java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection(Unknown Source) at java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection(Unknown Source) </code></pre>  <p>I don't see why the connection is refused, the server is well started on the same URL, PORT and DB as the one requested.</p>  <p>The server is well started, but the error happen when I want to open the connection:</p>  <pre><code>Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(DBURL, DBUSER, DBPWD + " " + DB_PWD); </code></pre>  <p>Any idea about what can be the cause?</p>  <p>Update: This problem was not related to the firewalls but mainly to the server DB path.</p>
