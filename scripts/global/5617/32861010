<p>I'm  currently implementing a batch insertion of data into mysql. I used <code>INSERT IGNORE</code> however when i loop through the <code>int[]</code> that i received, even rows that are "IGNORED" returns the value <code>1</code> but i need to keep track of the number of actual records being inserted.</p>  <pre><code>    insert ignore into demographics (mac_address,name,password,email,gender) values(?,?,?,?,?) </code></pre>
