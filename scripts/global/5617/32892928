<p>I recently set up an OpenShift project with the MySQL 5.5 cartridge. </p>  <p>Now I'm trying to reach this server. The DB name is 'wensput'.</p>  <p>The URL I'm trying to reach the MySQL is:<br>    <code>DB_URL = "jdbc:mysql://77.78.110.71:3306/Wensput";</code> AND    <code>DB_URL = "jdbc:mysql://IP/wensput";</code> WHERE IP = the IP my machine uses to connect to phpAdmin, also the 'Server' (something like: 127.9.203.293:3306</p>  <p>I tried them both with capatilazing and such but nothing seems to work. Now was my question, do I have the url right?  Or do I need to use like, the rhcloud.com/phpmyadmin url? What am I doing wrong?</p>  <p>EDIT: **** I first get a <code>java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.mysql.jdbc.Driver</code> exception, but: there are no complains about 'CLASSPATH' whatsoever. </p>
