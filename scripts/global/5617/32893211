<p>I'm moving a Vaadin application from my local environment to an EC2 server. It has a mysql database to which I currently connect using the code:</p>  <pre><code>connectionPool = new SimpleJDBCConnectionPool(                 "com.mysql.jdbc.Driver",                 "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/" + dbName, dbUser, dbPassword, 2, 50);          connection = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/" + dbName, connectionProperties);         statement = connection.createStatement(); </code></pre>  <p>Now I understand that all that I should do is change "localhost" for my server IP but it is not working... I'm have mysql correctly working on the server, and I even using phpmyadmin without any trouble...</p>  <p>I get the error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Communications link failure: The last packet sent successfully to the server was 0 milliseconds ago. The driver has not received any packets from the server.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Any ideas on what is wrong?</p>
