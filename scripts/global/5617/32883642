<p>I designed a java application using net beans, which connects to a database that is present on port 1527 and retrieves data. I have prepared a executable jar file by using build and compile. After running the jar i am getting the following error.</p>  <pre><code>     java.sql.sqlnontransientconnectionexception java.net.connectexception  error connecting to server localhost on port 1527 with message connection refused connect </code></pre>  <p>I have written the following code for connecting to derby database</p>  <pre><code> Class.forName("org.apache.derby.jdbc.ClientDriver");  String host= "jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/database/project.db;create=true";                Connection conn;                String user="user1";                String pass="pass1";                conn = DriverManager.getConnection(host,user,pass);                if (conn!= null) {                 JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null,"Connected to database");             } </code></pre>  <p>Is this error because of un availability of db on server or i have to do anything other than the code?</p>  <p>If i use a local database in my system the application is working fine. That db address i used in the code is given by the person who asks me to develop the application.</p>
