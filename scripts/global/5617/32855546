<ol> <li>I have a marathon app running which runs postgres. [viz. db-instance] </li> <li>I also have another application running on marathon which needs to connect to the first app using a database URL in the jdbc properties file. [viz app-instance]</li> </ol>  <p>Both of them are dockarized. When marathon spins out the "db-instance" it starts on different slave node in the cluster.</p>  <p>So how do i specify the jdbc url in the "app-instance" so that it is able to connect to the "db-instance"</p>
