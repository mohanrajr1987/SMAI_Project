<p>I am fetching the metadata of a database schema. I need to find out if a column is of unsigned or signed datatype. How do I find that out from the resultSet which gets the metadata. Which column will give me information regarding that? My question is how to grab whether the column is signed or unsigned from the java code? What is the column label that provides this information?</p>
