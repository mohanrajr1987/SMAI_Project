<p>I am using EclipseLink to connect different DBs. And run the same query against DB2 and SQLServer. The query runs well on DB2 but failed on SQLServer. </p>  <p>Here is the error message:</p>  <hr>  <pre><code>Internal Exception: com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerException: 'ROWNUMBER' is not a recognized built-in function name. Error Code: 195  Call: SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM (SELECT EL_TEMP.*, ROWNUMBER() OVER() AS EL_R OWNM FROM (SELECT t0.EVAL_ID AS a1, t0.EVAL_TYP_ID AS a2, t0.CREATE_DATETM AS a3 , t0.EVAL_DESC AS a4, t0.EVAL_NAME AS a5, t0.REVISION_NBR AS a6, t0.UPDATE_DATET M AS a7, t1.LOGICL_DB AS a8, t1.QUERY_STRING_HASH AS a9, t1.QUERY_STRING_TXT AS a10 FROM EVAL t0, SQL_EVAL t1 WHERE ((t0.EVAL_NAME = ?)

AS EL_TEMP3 WHERE EL_ROWNM &gt; ?         bind =&gt; [BA-TD.LODG_RM_NIGHT_TRANS_FACT.PRICE_AMT_LOCAL_WITH_OMS, 1, 1, 0] </code></pre>  <hr>  <p>I think this query is generated by EclipseLink since my original query is very simple. My question is, SQLServer cannot recognize 'ROWNUMBER' so how to change it to 'ROW_NUMBER'? Is there any way to config how EclipseLink does the SQL generation?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
