<p>I am using spree to build my application in rails. The application is almost ready, but I have used the routes provided by spree, of which some of them are not SEO friendly.    Example - for looking into any category it is /t/*id  Here I want to remove /t from this route, but I am using this at multiple places, so just changing in that route file doesn't solve my problem. Additionally there are several routes which needs to be changed.Is there any way to do this in spree or rails? Like creating alias for routes or mapping one route to other  </p>
