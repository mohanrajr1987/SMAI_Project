<p>Without cd-ing into the root directory of my Rails application, how can I execute a Rails or Rake command for that application.</p>  <p>I tried:</p>  <pre><code>bundle exec rake my_tasks:do_stuff BUNDLE_GEMFILE=/PATH/TO/RAILS_APP/Gemfile </code></pre>  <p>among other combinations, to no avail.</p>  <p>[Update]</p>  <p>The issue is actually two-fold, bundle doesn't know where the gemfile is and rake doesn't know what to run.</p>  <p>To use Bundler:</p>  <pre><code>BUNDLE_GEMFILE=/PATH/TO/RAILS_APP/Gemfile bundle exec ... </code></pre>  <p>Note that BUNDLE_GEMFILE has to go before 'bundle exec'.</p>  <p>To use Rake:</p>  <pre><code>rake -f /PATH/TO/RAILS_APP/Rakefile my_task:do_stuff </code></pre>  <p>To use Rails console:</p>  <pre><code>???? </code></pre>  <p>Have yet to figure out how to enter the Rails console from another directory.  Looking at the <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/3-1-stable/railties/lib/rails/cli.rb" rel="nofollow">source</a>, I think it may not be possible, because it eventually does File.join('script','rails') to kick off the rails process.</p>
