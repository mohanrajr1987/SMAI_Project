<p>I have two models: <strong>User</strong> and <strong>Club</strong> and I have a many-to-may relationship like:</p>  <pre><code>user has_and_belongs_to_many clubs club has_and_belongs_to_many users </code></pre>  <p>Now, I will have a third table with the result of this relationship:</p>  <p><strong>user_clubs(user_id, club_id)</strong></p>  <p>When generating scaffold, for example, <strong>rails generate scaffold User name:string birth_date:date gender:string login_id:integer</strong>, how can I generate that relationship? In the same way?</p>  <p>Thank you</p>
