<p>I am using the multinom function to predict the chances of pregnant women delivering spontaneously (outcome=0), experiencing fetal distress (outcome=1) or experiencing non-progressive labor(outcome=2) based on a number of predictive variables (both continuous and categorical). </p>  <p>The final model looks something like this</p>  <pre><code>model &lt;- multinom(Outcome ~  Gestational_age + Previous_CS + Fetal_Gender + diabetes + Birth_weight, data=sm) </code></pre>  <p>gestational age and birth weight are continuous variables, but the others such as previous c-section, fetal gender and diabetes are categorical variables. How do I take that into account using the reference levels?</p>  <p>Also, I would like to create two separate calibration plots to assess how good the final model is at predicting the risk for outcome 1 and 2 but I am not sure how the predict function works.  I had something like this but it doesnâ€™t really make much sense to me.</p>  <pre><code>p.fit &lt;- predict(model, sm$Outcome, type='probs') probabilities&lt;-data.frame(sm$Outcome1,p.fit) plsmo(p.fit, sm$Outcome1, datadensity=T, xlab="predicted probability" ylab="observed proportion") abline(0,1, col="red") </code></pre>  <p>Finally I need to plot the ROCR</p>
