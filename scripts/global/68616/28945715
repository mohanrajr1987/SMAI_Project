<p>I have been working with Ruby/Rails for years. The community is great. You can find a gem for pretty much anything you want to do.</p>  <p>Having said that, is there a reason why there is no gem which can do <strong>Roles and Permissions Based Authorization where Roles and Permissions are stored in the Database</strong> right out of the box? </p>  <p><em>In my experience, this is a basic requirement for pretty much any web application that is more than just a static website.</em> (obviously an arguable statement!)</p>  <p>I know there are tons of options out there for authorization like <a href="https://github.com/elabs/pundit" rel="nofollow">Pundit</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ryanb/cancan" rel="nofollow">CanCan</a>, <a href="https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan" rel="nofollow">CanCanCan</a> etc etc. But none of them do all of what I mentioned above.</p>  <p>I am not looking for code examples on how to accomplish this. I am looking for a <code>gem</code> that can do it all and use database to store roles and permissions. Is there one?</p>  <p>Thanks for the input.</p>
