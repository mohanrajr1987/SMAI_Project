<p>I have the following code</p>  <pre><code>users = User.where(city_id: '10') for user in users   #some code here end </code></pre>  <p>When <code>User</code> is an ActiveRecord object. If I put a breakpoint inside the for loop, the breakpoint does not get hit. The code does iterate thru the for loop, because my subsequent logic works. Why is this happening? Do I need to install a new gem for enabling this type of debugging?</p>
