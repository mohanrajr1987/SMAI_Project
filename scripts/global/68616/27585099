<p>I am trying to upgrade to Ruby 2.1.2 from 1.9.3 for my Rails app. </p>  <p>The problem I am facing is that the app's UI styling and layout has been destroyed by the upgrade. I can only see a white page with the UI elements (text boxes, select boxes) minus any styling arranged one below the other. </p>  <p>My <code>rails</code> version is fixed at 3.1.3 and my <code>jquery-rails</code> gem version is fixed at 2.2.1. I have tried to upgrade the 'jquery-rails' gem to higher (letting bundler work out the version - it sets it to 3.1.0). I also tried installing <code>jquery-ui-rails</code> gem with the upgraded <code>jquery-rails</code> gem as per <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/17830789/341008">this answer</a> and updated the assets accordingly. Neither worked. </p>  <p>What am I missing? What else should I be looking at? Google does not show anyone facing a similar situation.</p>  <p><strong>Update:</strong> I figured out which dependency causes the problem. It is <code>activerecord</code>. The Gemfile lists the following gems:</p>  <pre><code>gem 'railties', '3.1.3' gem 'rails', '3.1.3' gem 'activerecord', "3.1.3.patched", :require =&gt; "active_record" gem 'actionpack' </code></pre>  <p>If I try to move up from ruby 1.9.3, bundler complains about the version of <code>activerecord</code> - even for ruby 2.0.0.</p>  <pre><code>Bundler could not find compatible versions for gem "activerecord": In Gemfile:    rails (= 3.1.3) ruby depends on       activerecord (= 3.1.3) ruby     activerecord (3.1.3.patched) </code></pre>  <p>If I change the version of <code>activerecord</code> gem, my UI breaks. Anyone know why this happens? Or, can anyone suggest a workaround? Ideally I would like to move to ruby 2.1; if that's not possible, I would like to move to at least 2.0. There are some gems I would like to use which do not support ruby 1.9.x any more. However, I would have to stick to rails 3.x due to project dependencies. </p>
