<p>Is there any process in rails that i can initialize a remote site web page on my local app page. I want to fetch a remote web page like google home page <a href="https://www.google.com" rel="nofollow">https://www.google.com</a> through <code>&lt;% render "https://www.google.co.in" %&gt;</code> This is a requirement only because when ever i render a page in another controller so i faced error and i tried to solve it much more but now due to time i should prefer this </p>
