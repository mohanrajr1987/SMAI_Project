<p>I'm learning the basics of ruby on rails and I want to make some simple queries but I have a doubt:</p>  <p>I will have these models:</p>  <pre><code>class Client &lt; ActiveRecord::Base   has_one :address   has_many :orders   has_and_belongs_to_many :roles end  class Address &lt; ActiveRecord::Base   belongs_to :client end  class Order &lt; ActiveRecord::Base   belongs_to :client, counter_cache: true end  class Role &lt; ActiveRecord::Base   has_and_belongs_to_many :clients end </code></pre>  <p>Now, I will use scaffold to generate all the things, and I want to know if I have to directly put the foreign keys in the scaffols, like:</p>  <p><strong>rails generate scaffold Adress street:string number:integer client_id:integer</strong></p>  <p>Or when I make those associations and then migrate my db they will be implicit?</p>  <p>I don't know if I explain myself in the best way.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
