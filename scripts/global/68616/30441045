<p>I am new to Ruby-on-Rails I have following tables with below mentioned attributes</p>  <p>Supplier - id ,name,address etc------</p>  <p>Variant - id ,price,etc---</p>  <p>SupplierVariant- supplier_id,variant_id</p>  <p>LineItem - variant_id ,order_id</p>  <p>There is one more table called 'Order' which has line_items as it attribute.Each 'Order' object is linked to variant through lineitems.My requirement is to get all the supplier_ids from a particular order using the join operation between the tables.</p>  <p>I am using 'Spree' to build my application and for the above mentioned question I have tried the following in rails console</p>  <pre><code>ord=Spree::Order.find_by_number("R1218823")  var=ord.line_items.joins(:variant) </code></pre>  <p>till here it's working fine, but when I do <code>var.joins(:SupplierVariant)</code>, I am getting error.</p>
