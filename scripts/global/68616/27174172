<p>I am stuck with a performance related issue. I have a <strong>ROR application</strong> running on <strong>VPS</strong>. I am posting my question here after having spent lot of time on internet regarding this issue and was not able to find reliable solution.  My ROR application has nearly 300 premium <strong>videos</strong> and 200 pdf's, after registration user is allowed to watch Free Videos. If the user upgrades account by making <strong>payment</strong>, then he/she can watch <strong>premium videos</strong>.</p>  <p>Currently I am <strong>serving video</strong> file using <strong>send file method</strong>, below is the code.</p>  <pre><code>  SEND_FILE_METHOD = :default    def download      head(:not_found) and return if (track = Video.find_by_id(params[:id])).nil?     #head(:forbidden) and return unless track.downloadable?(current_user)       path = track.video.path(params[:style])      head(:bad_request) and return unless File.exist?(path) &amp;&amp; params[:format].to_s == File.extname(path).gsub(/^\.+/, '')     contenttype = MIME::Types.type_for(path).first.content_type # =&gt; "image/gif"     send_file_options = { :type =&gt;  contenttype  }      case SEND_FILE_METHOD       when :apache then send_file_options[:x_sendfile] = true       when :nginx then head(:x_accel_redirect =&gt; path.gsub(Rails.root, ''), :content_type =&gt; send_file_options[:type]) and return     end      send_file(path, send_file_options)   end </code></pre>  <p>My question here is,</p>  <ol> <li>what is this right way to serve premium video's via rails application.(My Client VPS has only 1 GB RAM ) and videos are saved in <strong>FILE SYSTEM</strong> on VPS. My concern is that, if my application gets more than a 100 request at a time, ROR app may fail to server request. I also thought of placing it in public folder, but the videos are only for Paid user, so I cant put them in public videos.</li> </ol>  <p>Any help or link to solution is highly appreciated.. Many Thanks :)</p>
