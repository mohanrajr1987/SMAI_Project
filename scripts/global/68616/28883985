<p>Folks,</p>  <p>I just used rails installer to install ruby on rails on my windows 8 machine. I was happy to see that my installation went through without any issue. As most of you know, it creates a dummy rails app on installation, todo app. I thought of running this before jumping into something else.</p>  <p>So, I did "bundle install" and then "rails s" to run server, it went well until I typed "localhost:3000" in my browser. Message I got in console was :</p>  <p>ERROR LoadError: Please install the sqlite3 adapter: 'gem install ativerecord-dqlite-adapter' </p>  <p>I needed to update the certificates(.pem file) to install sqlite3(Thanks to ruby-forum for helping me on this as well). Now, I can see that even sqlite3 is also installed on my machine.</p>  <p>Doing "bundle show sqlite3" gives : C:/Rails Installer/Ruby2.1.0/lib/ruby/gems/2.1.0/gems/sqlite3-1.3.8-x86-mingw32</p>  <p>Fair enough. So, I should be able to run server now. Right?</p>  <p>Surprisingly, "rails s" is giving me another error message now. Message is : C:/Rails Installer/Ruby2.1.0/lib/ruby/gems/2.1.0/gems/sqlite3-1.3.8-x86-mingw32/lib/sqlite3.rb: in 'require' : cannot load such file -- sqlite3/sqlite3_native from ... ....</p>  <p>Happily, I resolved this problem with the help of "<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17643897/cannot-load-such-file-sqlite3-sqlite3-native-loaderror-on-ruby-on-rails">cannot load such file -- sqlite3/sqlite3_native (LoadError) on ruby on rails</a>" But I seem to have caught in another problem after that. Problem is:</p>  <p>ERROR LoadError : Please install the sqlite3 adapter: <code>gem install activerecord-sqlite3-adapter</code> </p>  <p>Doing "gem install activerecord-sqlite3-adapter" gives</p>  <p>ERROR: Could not find a valid gem 'activerecord-sqlite3-adapter'.</p>  <p>Any idea? I wonder which adapter is it talking about..</p>
