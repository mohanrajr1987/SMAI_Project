<p>I have a column in my mysql table called download_count of type int.</p>  <p>Now I want to use update_all to update some fields with some values, but also increment the download_count along with it.</p>  <p>I have tried the following syntax:</p>  <pre><code>find_record.update_all(username: username, download_date: download_date, "download_count= download_count + 1") </code></pre>  <p>But I beleive the above acts like a where clause. So the download_count does not get updated. I want the username, download_date and the download_count to be updated by the above query.</p>  <p>Can someone point me to the correct syntax?</p>
