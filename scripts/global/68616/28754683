<p>I have a Rails app with asset pipelining disabled.</p>  <p>All my javascript files are in public/javascripts All my css files are in public/stylesheets</p>  <p>I can access the application.js file using the following link: <a href="http://localhost:3000/javascripts/application.js?1424977675" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:3000/javascripts/application.js?1424977675</a></p>  <p>What configuration change should I make, so that the following link works <a href="http://localhost:3000/mydir/myapp/javascripts/application.js?1424977675" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:3000/mydir/myapp/javascripts/application.js?1424977675</a></p>  <p>I have my application deployed in a subdirectory.
