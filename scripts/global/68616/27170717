Get the image in controller and upload to AWS server.<br>   3. No model coding for upload image to AWS.  </p>  <p>Instead of write code in model as below  </p>  <p><code>has_mongoid_attached_file :avatar, {       path: ':class/:id/:style/:basename.:extension',       storage: :s3,       bucket: bucket_name,       s3_credentials: {           access_key_id: 'access_key_id',           secret_access_key: 'secret_access_key'       },       styles: {           thumb: ['90x90^', :jpg],           feature: ['220x142^', :jpg],           show_page: ['720x420^', :jpg],           preview: ['145x90^', :jpg]       }   }</code>  </p>  <p>I want to upload image directly from controller.  </p>  <p>and only save the URL of uploaded image in database instead of below.  </p>  <p><code>"attachment_file_name": "imagename.png",   "attachment_content_type": "image/png",   "attachment_file_size": 1235,   "attachment_updated_at": TimeStamp,</code></p>  <p>i want to store only URL like this<br> <code>avatar = https://s3.amazonaws.com/bucket_name/imagename.png</code></p>  <p>NOTE: My project in <code>Rails 3.1.12</code> , <code>Ruby 1.9.3p484</code> using <code>mongoid</code> </p>
