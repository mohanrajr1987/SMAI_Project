<p>I wrote a little grid function for a 3x3 grid (code below). Works ok. I now need to make another grid that is different and custom. The first row should be 3, second should be 2 and the last row should be one (justified left).</p>  <p>I cannot ascertain the best way to do this and I am not sure if my current 3x3 grid is the best way to go about it either.</p>  <pre><code>// Grid top space against container float gridTopGap = 2.0; // Grid size 117, space between 2 gird is 3 float gridAndGap = 120;      for (UIImageView *grid in arr_grids) {             // Column position             int x_position = (int)grid.tag%3;             // Row position             int y_position = (int)grid.tag/3;              grid.frame = CGRectMake(x_position * gridAndGap, y_position * gridAndGap+gridTopGap, 117, 360);          } </code></pre>  <p>Can anyone offer assistance as to the math needed for starting a new row after 3 items, 2 items and finally 1?</p>
