<p>I'm using Bootstrap to build a Dashboard, but I'm rather new to Bootstrap and I'm having issues getting the final grid layout in the image below. The problem is that when I add the 4th column (Table), which will vertically house more data than the other 3 columns on the left (Widgets), is pushing down the bottom row content (Chart) like in this image. It looks easy, and I guess it has something to do with the 'colspan' or 'rowspan' features, but I can't figure it out.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/iPJYw.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/iPJYw.jpg" alt="http://i.stack.imgur.com/iPJYw.jpg"></a></p>  <p>Why is my chart getting pushed down like this, and how can I fix it?</p>
