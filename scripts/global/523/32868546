<p>I was wondering if there is any way to change the grid looking of chartjs. Or is this design default and cannot be changed.</p>  <p>I've looked into their documentation and the only commands I found that could potentially alter it is <code>Chart.Type.extend</code>.</p>  <p>For example, how could I make the X labels to be positioned left from the Vertical Grid <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/vtvD0.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/vtvD0.png" alt="Vertical Grid"></a> and  Y label numbers to be positioned under the Horizontal Grid<a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/pIeif.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/pIeif.png" alt="Horizontal Grid"></a></p>  <p>Is this even possible inside Chartjs? I've looked around in internet and I've seen many different modules. But I couldn't find the way to change the default grid look.</p>
