<p>it's my first post so please be kind :D .</p>  <p>I'm looking for a way to let the user of my program move a button (wich as an image as backgroung, and is the content of a Grid-Children) to another Grid-Children by drag-and-drop.</p>  <p>My Buttons are created by the program itself based on a database in a for-iteration:</p>  <pre><code>foreach (PC_Infos item in allPcsOnThisFloor) {     if (item != null)     {         roomToCoordinates(allPcsOnThisFloor[i].Room,out column, out row);         Button btn = new Button();         btn.Name = Name+ "_Button";         btn.Background = new ImageBrush(my icon here);         btn.Click += btn_Click;         btn.SetValue(Grid.ColumnProperty, column);         btn.SetValue(Grid.RowProperty, row);         My_Grid.Children.Add (btn);         i++;     }     else          break; } </code></pre>  <p><code>PC_Infos</code> is just a class holding the Properties: PC_Name, Room and MAC_adress nothing else.</p>  <p>My Grid:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;Grid x:Name="Grid_10" AllowDrop="True"&gt;     &lt;Grid.Background&gt;         &lt;ImageBrush ImageSource="C:\Users\XXX\XXX\buildingPlan.png"/&gt;     &lt;/Grid.Background&gt;     &lt;Grid.ColumnDefinitions&gt;         &lt;ColumnDefinition /&gt;         [...]         &lt;ColumnDefinition /&gt;     &lt;/Grid.ColumnDefinitions&gt;     &lt;Grid.RowDefinitions&gt;         &lt;RowDefinition /&gt;         [...]         &lt;RowDefinition /&gt;     &lt;/Grid.RowDefinitions&gt; &lt;/Grid&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Now is there a way to use a <code>btn.*</code> wich fetches the current postion (Row and Column) when draged, and another <code>btn.*</code> wich creates a new copy of this button in the Grid-Child the mouse is currently over when the mouse drops the button? Or is there even a way to 'move' the button from one Child to another?</p>  <p>BTW: My Program should show a buildingplan with PCs as icons(buttons) on it at the place they actualy are. A rough guess is takes by the source code by reading the column "Room" in my db. But a room isn't just one place. Someone works at the window anotheron at the door, this should be marked by user (with drag&amp;drop) I'm using a WPF-Application in VS'13 with C# and .Net 4.5.1.</p>  <p>PS: If there is anybody who says: Why Grid and why the hell buttons? :D : When the User clicks on the icon a new window with system value such as OS, RAM, CPU... will show up. But I'm open for any implementation. I haven't done programming for so long now, so I may not know the best way.</p>  <p><a href="http://alexander.valerius.wilhelm-gym.net/Grid.PNG" rel="nofollow">While I'm not allowed to post images with 0 Rep, here is a Link to an img wich shows my Grid over my buildingplan</a></p>  <p>Hope you get my Question :D Thanks for your help. If any questions ask ;)</p>
