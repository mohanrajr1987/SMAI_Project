<p>Is it safe to assume that the code before <code>(AtomicInteger a).addAndGet(-1)</code> will be always executed before this call, i.e. JVM will <strong>not</strong> reorder the instructions around the <code>addAndGet</code> call?</p>  <p>If yes, is it safe to assume that other threads checking the state of the same <code>AtomicInteger</code> instance (e.g. <code>if (a.compareAndSet(0, -1))</code>) will see everything the first thread has changed before the <code>addAndGet</code> call?</p>
