<p>I know similar questions have been asked, but they are unsatisfactory to me. I have the latest Java 8u60 (according to sysprefs), and when I run <code>java -d32</code>, it says:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Error: This Java instance does not support a 32-bit JVM.</p> </blockquote>  <p>The Oracle JDK has no information on which package I need as there is only one (dmg/tar.gz) available.  Am I missing something here?</p>
