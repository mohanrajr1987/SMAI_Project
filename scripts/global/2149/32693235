<p>issue: java commits big amount of virtual memory AND DOESN'T release it.Then server goes down. But java(tomcat) consumes normal amount of memory. For example real heap is 1gb, but commited virtaul memory is 30g... parametrs for old config: min/max heap - 512m/2048m, tread stack size 512kb, perm 64m, max perm 256m</p>  <p>Server status now: Physical memory: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>16383.55 MB Available memory: 4917.84 MB Total page file: 47103.55 MB Free page file: 34961.65 MB Memory load: 69  Process kernel time:   1701.58 s Process user time: 9451.538 s</p>      <p>PS Eden Space Heap memory 129.00 MB 509.50 MB 634.50 MB 467.03 MB   (73%)  PS Old Gen Heap memory 341.50 MB 1064.00 MB 1365.00 MB 884.52   MB (64%)  PS Survivor Space Heap memory 21.00 MB 9.00 MB 9.00 MB 0.00   MB (0%)  Code Cache Non-heap memory 2.43 MB 21.75 MB 48.00 MB 21.50 MB   (44%)  PS Perm Gen Non-heap memory 64.00 MB 178.50 MB 256.00 MB 178.47   MB (69%)</p> </blockquote>  <p>what i have:</p>  <blockquote>   <ul>   <li>windows server 2012r2, </li>   <li>4vCPUs, </li>   <li>16GB of ram (was 2vCPU and 8GB of ram)</li>   <li>Apache Tomcat/7.0.56</li>   <li>JVM 1.7.0_72-b14</li>   <li>application server for DAM with few sites, less than 200 users</li>   <li>Virtaul memory size is defined by policy and set to be managed by a system (sounds like joke but has ~45gb...)</li>   </ul> </blockquote>  <p>what i did: i was trying to reconfigure server changing GC settings, agrresive heap, heap sizes etc. without any result. </p>  <p>what do you need: like screens, heap dump, GC logs?</p>  <p>thank you in advance, i will be waiting for all suggestions!
