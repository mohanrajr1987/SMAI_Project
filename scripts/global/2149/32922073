<p>I wonder if there is a "cheap" way to get a faster compile times for scala in order to use it for learning the language by writing simple scripts. When you learn new language it get's really hard to wait 8 seconds after each typo you made (and there are hundreds of typos as you are newbie).</p>  <p>Can scala compiler compile faster by disabling certain Java classes or other parts of a compiler or JVM that may be irrelevant for basic language learning usage scenario?</p>
