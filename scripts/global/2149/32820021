<p>We are facing a VerifyError in our application while deploying to WAS environment. The following is the exception:</p>  <pre><code>Error 500: org.springframework.web.util.NestedServletException:  Handler processing failed; nested exception is java.lang.VerifyError:  JVMVRFY012 stack shape inconsistent; class=com/org/jaxb/Input_JAXB_Deserialization_Stub, method=write(ILjava/lang/Object;)V, pc=356 </code></pre>  <p>We are still trying to identify the issue, but all efforts not going well. Is there any way that the libraries used in run time is good in bytecode compatibility?. For example, we can add all the libraries and run the byte code verification.</p>
