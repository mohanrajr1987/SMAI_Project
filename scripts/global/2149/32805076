<p>I don't know if there is a straightforward answer to this. I have the specifications of different CPU types. For example, two instances,A and B.  I want to run some simple java console application in A and B. Based on their specifications, can I assume the runtime of B after knowing the runtime on A?</p>  <p>Second questions is about the core numbers. So, can I assume the runtime of machine with i cores after knowing the result on the same machine with j cores?</p>  <p>Is there some approximations on this? The instances I am talking are Amazon EMR instances.</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
