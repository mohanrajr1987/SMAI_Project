<p>I want to learn Common Lisp and I have some experience with Java. I heard that Armed Bear is a dialect of CL that runs on the JVM, thus allowing me to use Java libraries. But I don't know how to install it so that I can do exercises.</p>  <p><strong>Is there a plugin I can install in Eclipse in order to run Common Lisp code?</strong> I already read on the internet and there are no guides for doing anything of this.</p>
