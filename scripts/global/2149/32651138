<p>While I was going through <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-8.html#jls-8.4.3.3" rel="nofollow">jls</a>, in the example section for final methods, it quotes:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Such inlining cannot be done at <strong>compile time</strong> unless it can be guaranteed that Test and Point will always be <strong>recompiled together</strong>, so that whenever Point - and specifically its move method - changes, the code for Test.main will also be updated. </p> </blockquote>  <p>So how can one ensure that two classes can ALWAYS be compiler together. One obvious example would be in case inner/nested classes we can say that they would be always compiled together. What are the other ways?</p>
