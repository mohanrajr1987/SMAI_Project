<p>I have two server that uses the same configuration and using separate Oracle server.</p>  <p>One is more rapid then the other the only difference is the rows on the server, the server has a web application installed and when we access to that webpage the graphics are showing slowly , because we has more than one environment , in the other server the access is quick.</p>  <p>The server is running Redhat linux with TomEE+ can you suggest how to test performance and the tools that I need, free tools or payed tools, preference free tools to measure performance of JSP pages, Oracle database and JVM in the Linux server and if possible tools that can run on Linux terminal not a graphic tool and if graphic one that can connect remotely to the server.</p>  <p>Thanks you in advance.</p>
