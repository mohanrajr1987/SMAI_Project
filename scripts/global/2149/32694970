<p>I wrote an extension based on smartfoxserver2x, when I run some 90-95 clients continuously for some time to check loadtesting, I observed in the smartfoxserver admin that ExtensionControlRequest Queue is increasing and decreasing,  sometimes its reaching to 100 000 also at that time server extension is not responding properly.</p>  <p>When I checked the Smartfoxserver2x documentation it saying ExtensionControlQueues are referring the requests handled by our designed extensions.</p>  <p>How to control the Extension Control Queue? Due to security reasons I am unable to share my extensions code </p>
