<p>I have one java application which is forking child JVM for doing some execution. Child process looks same like parent one including all arguments.</p>  <p>TO confirm the parent, i verified parent Id and its always original JVM.</p>  <p>Application is running as plain java process i.e. not in any server like apache, weblogic etc. As processes have same args, both are writing to same log files and open files are too same.</p>  <p>This is new behaviour which was not present earlier. Could someone provide clue around what to check to find cause</p>  <p>JVM version:- OpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea 2.5.6) (7u79-2.5.6-0ubuntu1.14.04.1) OS: Ubuntu 14.04 </p>
