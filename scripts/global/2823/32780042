<p>this is my first post @ Stack Overflow so forgive any breaches in etiquette.</p>  <p>I'm looking to build a number of forms for my new school that will automatically <strong>pre-populate user data</strong> from my teachers and student's <strong>google accounts</strong> on my domain.</p>  <p>I understand that this will involve building a <strong>custom URL</strong> and I've looked around at a few solutions out there for each task, however I'm just starting off as a developer with Apps Script and I don't yet understand how to get at the accounts data.</p>  <p>So for example:</p>  <p>Each of my teachers has a group of students based on the day they attend. I have a Monday group, Tuesday etc...</p>  <p>I've placed the students into these <strong>google groups</strong> and what I'd like to be able to do is <strong>build a form taking a register of attendance</strong>.</p>  <p>This register should pre-populate with all the learners for that particular day, the teacher taking the register and should provide the options for Present, Late, Explained Absence and Unexplained Absence.</p>  <p>When submitted the form should save to a <strong>google sheet</strong>.</p>  <p>Optional <strong>bonus extra</strong> would be a method of <strong>incorporating digital signatures</strong>.</p>  <p>Any help with this would be really appreciated. Looking forward to getting going with this. :)</p>
