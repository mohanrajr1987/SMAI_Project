<p>I have in each aspx a filter part which include different types of controls(textbox,radiobutton,checklist...) And when user change the value of any control in filter body this new value will be saved as default for current user and when close the session or rendering the page this new values will be set as default for this page...btw this application contains about 50 aspx page and not prefered to use cookie .can output page caching can solve this problem??? Or will be pending on the current browser?i am wondering what will be the best practise solution! Thanks in advance</p>
