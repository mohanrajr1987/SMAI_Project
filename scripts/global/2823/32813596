<p>I am using an updatePanel in ASP.NET, and on the same page there is a radio group.  I am using javascript code which accesses the "name" attribute of the radio input fields.  Then it makes a new element with an ID = to the name of the radio input field.  To make the UpdatePanel work, I removed <code>&lt;xhtmlconformancemode="legacy"/&gt;</code></p>  <p>Before I did that, the name rendered for a radio button by asp would look like: <strong>MyControl:Country</strong>, which can be used inside a selector string by jQuery as well.  But after removing, it looks like this : <strong>MyControl$Country</strong>, which throws an exception like : <strong>“Syntax error, unrecognized expression”</strong></p>  <p>Is there any way I can remove the xhtmlconformancemode entry from my web.config, yet keep the old control naming scheme?</p>
