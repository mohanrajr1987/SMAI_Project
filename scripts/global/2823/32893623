<p>I was working on my project and it was working good and i did not edit any code and now when i run project every where i use my context thrown 'Object reference not set to an instance of an object' error. For example :</p>  <pre><code>var db = new ApplicationDbContext(); Response.Write(db.Transactions.FirstOrDefault().Status); </code></pre>  <p>here thrown an error that says db is null. or :</p>  <pre><code>var manager = new UserManager(); ApplicationUser user = manager.Find(txtUserName.Text, txtPassword.Text); </code></pre>  <p>says that user is null but i have database and i have user! or even in Application_Start in <code>Global.ascx</code> file :</p>  <pre><code>Database.SetInitializer(new UsersDbInitializer()); var db = new ApplicationDbContext(); db.Database.Initialize(true); </code></pre>  <p>it says db is null! Everywhere i use <code>ApplicationDbContext</code> it returns null.</p>
