<p>I am creating a custom module that will find articles on my site based on the page tag used on any page. In order to do this I will need to find the TabId which I have done by simply adding <code>DotNetNuke.Common;</code> to the namespace and using <code>this.TabId</code> to get the actual TabID. </p>  <p>The trouble I am having is trying to find what taxonomy tag(or tags) being used on the current page. </p>  <p><strong>Edited</strong> I tried using <a href="http://www.aubrett.com/InformationTechnology/WebDevelopment/CMSPlatforms/DotNetNuke/ListTaxonomyTermsbyPage.aspx" rel="nofollow">this tutorial</a> and I was not able to get the list to print out. Several references seem to be missing in the article.</p>
