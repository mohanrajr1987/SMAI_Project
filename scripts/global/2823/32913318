<p>I'm trying to get an existing .net webforms site to work behind Cloudfront but all the webforms break.</p>  <p>Looking deeper -- the site displays fine, but webforms break because the <code>&lt;script src="/WebResource.axd?[...]"&gt;</code> is completely missing.  Not 404 -- missing -- the script tag is completely missing from the html response.  </p>  <p>This seems to be that .NET sniffs browser and responds with a custom build of WebResource.axd for that particular browser+page.</p>  <p>If no <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18244223/webform-dopostbackwithoptions-is-undefined-in-ie11-preview">browser match is found</a>.  No WebResource.axd.</p>  <p>Doing <code>curl http://some-aspnet-webforms-site.example.com/form.aspx</code> also seems to confirm this.  No WebResource.axd included.</p>  <p>How do I get Cloudfront to spoof the end-user's browser so WebResource.axd gets included?  (Forwarding cookies and querystring doesn't seem to work and forwarding all headers seems to break cloudfront.)</p>  <p>Or at the very least, how do I force .net to always inject/insert WebResource.axd even when sniffing fails?</p>
