<p>I have a number of ASP.NET Web Form Websites (the one with no .csproj file), and I am trying to figure out how to best use NuGet packages with them. When using Visual Studio 2015, adding NuGet packages via the UI works correctly (there is a packages.config in the site root), and the build drops the binaries in the bin folder. </p>  <p>The problem is trying to build the project on TeamCity via MSBuild. For other projects, I can use NuGet.exe with the restore command (either against the csproj or the sln file), and the packages are correctly downloaded and included in the output. However, this doesn't work with the websites, and thus the compile fails due to missing files. </p>  <p>As a last resort, I could write a custom script/build step to manually copy the assemblies to the bin folder, but I'd like to avoid this. Am I missing something? Is there any way to use NuGet with websites outside of Visual Studio?</p>  <p>Thanks, Erick</p>
