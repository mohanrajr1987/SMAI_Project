<p>I'm trying to audit my legacy WebForms app for XSS vulnerability. Being a WebForms app, it mostly writes content to the page via controls, TextBox, Label, etc, plus the <code>&lt;% ... %&gt;</code> syntax. </p>  <p>My question is: do all controls encode HTML, so that I know that anything like <code>&lt;asp:SomeControl ... &gt;</code> is safe, or are there some controls that do not, and which require manual, explicit encoding? And, is there any other way that text can get on the page in WebForms without being encoded?</p>  <p>I'm not talking about actual HTML or rich text editor controls here, just conventional text display controls.</p>
