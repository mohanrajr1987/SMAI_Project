<p>ASP.NET WebForms application.  There is a custom web control (IE inherits from System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebControl).  I can put breakpoints anywhere in CreateChildControls() or any other overloaded method and these breakpoints work fine.  However, if I try to add a breakpoint to a method that is bound to a Button on the page, I get an error on the breakpoint:</p>  <pre><code>The breakpoint will not currently be hit.  No executable code of the debugger's target code is associated with this line.  Possible causes include: conditional compilation, compiler optimizations, or the target architecture of this line is not supported by the current debugger code type. </code></pre>  <p>I've tried cleaning the solution, deleting all bin/obj folders, restarting local IIS, recycling the app pool, all to no avail.</p>  <p>Code is in VB.NET (sorry). Here is the function definition (in the WebControl code):</p>  <pre><code> Private Sub AddToCartClick(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs)       // breakpoint on line 1 </code></pre>  <p>Here is the code that ties the function to the Button:</p>  <pre><code> Dim button = new Button  AddHandler button.Click, AddressOf AddToCartClick </code></pre>  <p>The code executes and has worked for a long time, but I cannot debug it with breakpoints.</p>
