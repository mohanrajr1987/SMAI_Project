<p>Forgive me, I am new at this and the different php I have tried hasn't really worked at all. I've found examples for Natural Language forms, but none with working PHP and I'm familiar with PHP when used with traditional forms, but I'm having problems putting the two together. </p>  <p>The general form layout goes like this:<br> My name is [your name].<br> Today, I am [whatchya gonna do?].<br> I'm doing this because [c'mon,why?].<br> It's important that I [what you said you'd do] because [the big picture].<br> Shoot me an email with my awesome new declaration at [your email]<br> Button 1 (sends email)<br> Button 2 (copies all text and input fields to clipboard -- not as important right now)<br></p>  <p>Button 1, I want to send a copy to myself with a hard coded email address and also send a copy to the user with the email address they've entered.</p>  <p>This is a little messy right now, as I am simply trying to get it to work... again, I have no included PHP because at this point -- I've confused myself so much that I don't know what to include.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;form method="post" action="todayiam.php"&gt;   &lt;div class="naturallanguageform"&gt;     &lt;div class="nlfinner"&gt;       &lt;p class="line"&gt; &lt;span class="copy"&gt;My name is &lt;/span&gt;         &lt;span class="inputcontainer"&gt;&lt;input class="textinput" name="name" value="" placeholder="[your name]"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;         &lt;span class="copy"&gt;Today, I am &lt;/span&gt;         &lt;span class="inputcontainer"&gt;&lt;input class="textinput" name="todayiam" value="" placeholder="[whatchya gonna do?]"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;          &lt;span class="copy"&gt;I'm doing this because &lt;/span&gt;         &lt;span class="inputcontainer"&gt;&lt;input class="textinput" name="why" value="" placeholder="[c'mon, why?]"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="copy"&gt; It's important that I &lt;/span&gt;         &lt;span class="inputcontainer"&gt;&lt;input class="textinput" name="whatusaid" value="" placeholder="[what you said you'd do]"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;         &lt;span class="copy"&gt; because &lt;/span&gt;         &lt;span class="inputcontainer"&gt;&lt;input class="textinput" name="because" value="" placeholder="[the big picture]"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;       &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;span class="copy"&gt;Shoot me an email with my awesome new declaration at&lt;/span&gt;         &lt;span class="inputcontainer"&gt;&lt;input class="textinput" name="email" value="" placeholder="[your email]"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;p class="line"&gt;         &lt;button class="button"&gt;Send to E-mail&lt;/button&gt;       &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="line"&gt;         &lt;button class="button"&gt;Copy to post in comments&lt;/button&gt;       &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/form&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Any assistance will be greatly appreciated.</p>  <p>Update:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php        // from the form        $name = trim(strip_tags($_POST['name']));        $email = trim(strip_tags($_POST['email']));        $message = htmlentities($_POST['todayiam']);         // set here        $subject = "Contact form submitted!";        $to = 'email@gmail.com';         $body = &lt;&lt;&lt;HTML $message HTML;         $headers = "From: $email\r\n";        $headers .= "Content-type: text/html\r\n";         // send the email        mail($to, $subject, $body, $headers);         // redirect afterwords, if needed        header('Location: index.html'); ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Another update</p>  <p>I have changed  $headers = "From: $email\r\n"; to $headers = "From: email@gmail.com" . "\r\n" ; to set a static from address (my support email) and the email is still identifying as from CGI Mailer. I have verified that it's not a caching issue and the correct files are being used.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php  if (isset($_POST['name'], $_POST['todayiam'], $_POST['why'], $_POST['whatusaid'], $_POST['because'], $_POST['email']) {     // We enter this statement only if all the fields has been properly defined, this to avoid getting undefined index     $name = $_POST['name'];     $todayIam = $_POST['todayiam'];     $why = $_POST['why'];     $whatYouSaid = $_POST['whatusaid'];     $because = $_POST['because'];     $email = $_POST['email'];      // We define the variables for using in mail()     $to  = 'email@gmail.com';     $to .= ', '.$email; // You wanted them to recieve a copy     $subject = "Contact form submitted!";      // You can put a lot more headers, check out the mail() documentation     $headers = "From: email@gmail.com" .

";     $message .= "Today, I am $todayIam.";     $message .= "I'm doing this because $why.";     $message .= "It's important that I $whatYouSaid";     $message .= "because $because.";      if (mail($to, $subject, $message, $header)) {         // Mail was successfully sent! Do something here     } } ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Before you posted your answer, I was working on this script:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php  // from the form        $name = trim(strip_tags($_POST['name']));        $email = trim(strip_tags($_POST['email']));        $message = htmlentities($_POST['todayiam']);          // set here        $subject = "Contact form submitted!";        $to = 'email@gmail.com';         $body = &lt;&lt;&lt;HTML $message HTML;         $headers = "From: $email\r\n";        $headers .= "Content-type: text/html\r\n";         // send the email        mail($to, $subject, $body, $headers);         // redirect afterwords, if needed        header('Location: index.html'); ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>The  $email = trim(strip_tags($_POST['email'])); field was pulling the user's email and using it for the sent from as noted in the $header... so it was working fine. With the new script, that you posted, I can't get it to work with my hard coded email OR the user's email as the FROM. Initially, I really wanted to understand what the differences were between the script, why one worked and the other didn't, but now... I'd really just like my email to be hard coded as the FROM. I'll worry about the differences later. As I said before, I really have tried to get this to work in many different forms... I am sure it's something simple that I am over looking as a novice to PHP. Thanks.</p>
