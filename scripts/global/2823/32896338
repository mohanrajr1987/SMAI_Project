<p>I have two functioning sites, one ASP.Net Web Forms and another is ASP.Net MVC. I am aware that it is entirely possible to have both work together in the same project, but virtually everything I've seen online talks about adding new code to an existing site of the opposite type. </p>  <p>I'd kind of like to just move the existing MVC app under the WebForms app, but that seems too simple on the surface given some of the same directories (App_Data etc). Here's my question: what are the gotchas? Should I create a directory and just dump all of the MVC code in there, or should I move the components individually?</p>  <p>Just looking for some best practice guidance if anyone cares to share.</p>  <p>V</p>
