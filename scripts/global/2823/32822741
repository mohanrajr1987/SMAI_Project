<p>I'm wondering if there's a way to achieve this "live", such as using an HTML5 element or similar. Quite simply, I have a number of status messages that I have written using 'Debug.Write', and running through them all lets me know that everything is working as expected (I'm not the best of debugger users). </p>  <p>Alas, the perils of working with one single screen mean that it's not always possible to clearly view both windows, even using snap-to-border features. Is accessing the debugger output even possible?</p>
