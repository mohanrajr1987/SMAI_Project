<p>In webforms I am able to write canned functions that build and return a Control (Such as HtmlGenericControl) and add it to the page in the ASPX code behind.</p>  <p>In MVC5 I am attempting to call those old functions within my view and have the control be rendered to the view.</p>  <p>A contrived example is something of the form:</p>  <pre><code>@{      SomeClass.Method(); } </code></pre>  <p>Where .Method() returns an HtmlGenericControl.</p>  <p>How would I get the returned control to render to the page?</p>
