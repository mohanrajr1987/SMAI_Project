<p>I have an internal .NET 4.0 web forms app with a sql server backend. I have a menu on the home screen that I need to show/hide parts of based on which groups the user is in. I am struggling with the best way to do this. In the past I have called js functions from the code behind using ScriptManager.RegisterStartupScript. However, I feel like this is bad practice and don't want to keep doing it if it is. I know I could just set my html table cells that need manipulating to runat server and add the property in the code behind when I lookup the user's security. Should I do that and forget about trying to go back and forth between the code behind and js? Or, is there a way to accomplish this that is good web programming practice? </p>  <p>Seems like this is a common scenario, which is why I think I'm missing something obvious. Lookup something from database, then execute js to manipulate front end. </p>  <p>Note: I bounce between plain js and jQuery, so feel free to answer with either.</p>
