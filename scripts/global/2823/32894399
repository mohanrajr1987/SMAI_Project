<p>I Have a couple of apps that have the same problem, I need to run those in IIS. (I go to Properties, Web, and assign Start URL as <a href="https://mycomputername.com/ProjectName/" rel="nofollow">https://mycomputername.com/ProjectName/</a>), it runs correctly, however if I set a break point, it will never stop there.</p>  <p>The breakpoints always read:</p>  <pre><code>The breakpoint will not currently be hit. No symbols have been loaded for this document. </code></pre>  <p>My solution is located at the wwwroot, and I run Visual Studio 2010. If I switch from Start URL to Specific Page, the breakpoints work again. But I need the Start URL since there are some functions in my solution that only work that way.</p>  <p>I know that there are other solutions I have that are also being run on IIS and don't have this issue. The only difference I notice from the other projects that could be relevant is that those are WebSites in VS 2010, while mine is a Web Project.</p>  <p>Projects with this icon do work <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/nhy2I.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/nhy2I.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>My project with this icon does not <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/SQiHJ.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/SQiHJ.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I have already messed around with the Tools->Options->Debugging->General. No success</p>  <p>Debug->Break All->. No success</p>  <p>Any ideas on how could I get this fixed?</p>
