<p>I have a web forms page that redirects to an MVC controller, and on a link click, it navigates back to the web forms page.  The web forms page redirects to the MVC controller via the following below.  Before this, I check the total number of session keys and it's 28.  The redirect happens via:</p>  <pre><code>Response.Redirect("/My/Services"); </code></pre>  <p>Putting a breakpoint in the controller and running the following in the immediate window: <code>HttpContext.Session.Keys</code> and get a value of 28. The session variables were all established in the web forms application.  All my controller is doing right now is:</p>  <pre><code>public ActionResult Services() { return View(); } </code></pre>  <p>In the view, it's rendering a link that looks like:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;a class="btn btn-default" href="/virtualdir/ServicesList.aspx"&gt;Back to Services List&lt;/a&gt; </code></pre>  <p>When I click this link and go back to the services list page, I check the number of session keys and it's 0.  I don't know why; this shouldn't cause the issue?  I temporarily replaced the <code>href</code> attribute with: <code>../../ServicesList.aspx</code>, but still the value is zero...  why are the session variables being lost?</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Even with a simple postback to the controller, sesison is lost.  Either situation is confirmed with the following test.  Session is being returned as a new session.  The new session routine is being called below.</p>  <pre><code>   protected void Application_PostAcquireRequestState(Object sender, EventArgs e)     {      var context = ((HttpApplication)sender).Context;       if (context.Session == null)         return;        if (context.Session.IsNewSession)      {         //Triggers on postback to controller or redirect from controller to web form page      }   } </code></pre>  <p>So session is being lost for some reason...</p>
