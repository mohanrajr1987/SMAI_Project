<p>I have a generic method for an item just wanted to delete more than one item, the parameter would be a List. How do I do?</p>  <p>Error: An attempt has been made to Attach or Add an entity that is not new, perhaps having been loaded from another DataContext.  This is not supported.</p>  <p>Could help me? </p>  <pre><code>    public static void Remove&lt;T&gt;(IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; items) where T : class     {         try         {             // to work with disconnected data, attach the new object to the             // table, call delete on submit, and then submit changes             using (PurchaseOrderTrackingDataContext context = new PurchaseOrderTrackingDataContext())             {                 var table = context.GetTable&lt;T&gt;();                  foreach (var item in items)                 {                     table.Attach(item);                     table.DeleteOnSubmit(item);                 }             }         }         catch (Exception)         {             throw;         }     } </code></pre>
