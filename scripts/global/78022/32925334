<p>I have an existing Django project and am adding a new app which consists of an API (using the rest-framework) and an angular app. This app contains one Django template, which simply serves as a way for Angular to hook in, and then work with it's own partials:</p>  <pre><code>{% extends "base.html" %} {% block content %}  &lt;div ui-view&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  {% endblock %} </code></pre>  <p>From here, I would like for angular to take over the routing of the application:</p>  <pre><code>$resourceProvider.defaults.stripTrailingSlashes = false;  // Routing $locationProvider.html5Mode({   enabled: true,   requireBase: false });  $stateProvider     .state('list', {         url: '/routines',         templateUrl: 'static/partials/routine/routine_list.html',         controller: 'RoutineListController',     })     .state('add', {         url: '/routines/add',         templateUrl: 'static/partials/routine/routine_add_edit.html',         controller: 'RoutineAddController',     });  $urlRouterProvider.otherwise('/routines'); </code></pre>  <p>This works fine for the first page the app loads, however attempting to navigate to any subsequent page results in Django displaying a 404 error message</p>  <pre><code>Page not found (404) Request Method: GET Request URL:    http://127.0.0.1:8000/routines/add </code></pre>  <p>Based on my current (limited) knowledge of both systems, I attempted to specify a url in my Django config that would apply to all routine/* urls and not load a template, allowing angular to request the partial it requires so it can continue running the SPA uninterrupted. However, I was unable to find any information on specifying a URL without a template, leading me to believe that this is not the correct solution.</p>  <pre><code>urlpatterns = [  url(r'^$', views.routineView, name='routine'),  url(r'^/.*$', views.routineView, name='angular'), </code></pre>  <p>Summary: I would like to use Angular and a Django rest API app to create a web application. However, I would like to keep the rest of my existing Django site and simply add this on (an embedded SPA in my current Django base.html template). How do I set up the routing (on both Angular and Django) so that Django allows Angular to run interrupted once a certain page has been requested (in this case site.com/routines).</p>
