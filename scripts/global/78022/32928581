<p>I'm wondering if there's a way to select the "Grouping" row in angular-grid.</p>  <p>For example, in the example shown on the website: <a href="http://www.ag-grid.com/angular-grid-grouping/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.ag-grid.com/angular-grid-grouping/index.php</a></p>  <p>You can set the "rowSelection" parameter to "single" in order to highlight an entire row at the lowest node.  However, that does not allow you to highlight the "Country" row.</p>  <p>In the example, the only way to do this is to "select all" the elements below that row.</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
