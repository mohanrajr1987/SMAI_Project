<p>I'm creating a product gallery directive in Angular, which will allow the user to scroll through images with left/right arrows.</p>  <p>What is the most appropriate angular approach to feed my directive with the array of image URLs? </p>  <p>You can assume that the parent controller has already made an API call to receive this the array of URLs</p>  <p>E.g.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div data-ng-controller="MyController as myController"&gt;     &lt;my-image-gallery&gt;&lt;/my-image-gallery&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Should I just have an attribute of  that takes in the JSON array? Perhaps something like:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;my-image-gallery images="myController.ImageList"&gt;&lt;/my-image-gallery&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Although, I'm not even sure if the above is possible. It would mean the JSON would have to be converted into a string? </p>  <p>There must be a better way</p>  <h2>Edit</h2>  <p>As per comments, I've tried the above method, but I can't access the "images" field from within my controller. </p>  <p>Here is what I have defined in my directive:</p>  <pre><code>    scope: {         imageSource: '='     }, </code></pre>  <p>Then in my controller, I assume I should just be able to reference the variable imageSource, shouldn't I?</p>
