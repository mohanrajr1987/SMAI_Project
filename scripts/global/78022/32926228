<p>I am trying to create couple select buttons that will be dynamic, and for the first one it worked fine using ng-options.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;select ng-options="muscles.name for muscles in bigdata.muscles track by muscles.id" ng-model="selected"&gt;&lt;/select&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Now as for the second one, it simple didnt work, or didnt print.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;select ng-options="exercises.name for exercises in bigdata.exercises" ng-model="selected"&gt;&lt;/select&gt; </code></pre>  <p>and the third one, printed the full array, instead of separating it.</p>  <pre><code>   &lt;select ng-options="reps for reps in bigdata.muscles.reps" ng-model="selected"&gt;&lt;/select&gt; </code></pre>  <p>My Json file looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>{    "name": "Gym App", "muscles":[         {             "id":1,             "name": "chest",             "reps": [4,6,7,8,9,10,11,12],             "weight": [2,4,6,8,10,12,16,18,20,22,24,26,28,30],             "image": "img/muscles/chest.jpg",             "exercises": [                 {                     "name": "ALTERNATING FLOOR PRESS",                     "rating": 6.1                 }, (and goes on with exercises)... </code></pre>  <p>Do objects inside objects need to be treated different?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
