<p>I am trying to create a process that send command to cmd.exe and receive Error 2, Why? It's posible? How?</p>  <pre><code>    STARTUPINFO si;     PROCESS_INFORMATION pi;     ZeroMemory(&amp;si, sizeof(si));     si.cb = sizeof(si);     ZeroMemory(&amp;pi, sizeof(pi));      String pathexe = "C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe";     String command= "notepad.exe";      if(!CreateProcess(             pathexe.c_str(),  // lpApplicationName             command.c_str(),  // lpCommandLine             NULL,   // lpProcessAttributes             NULL,   // lpThreadAttributes             FALSE,  // bInheritHandles             0,      // dwCreationFlags             NULL,   // lpEnvironment             NULL,   // lpCurrentDirectory             &amp;si,    // lpStartupInfo             &amp;pi     // lpProcessInformation             ))     {         AnsiString error = GetLastError();         ShowMessage("Error: " + error);     }     WaitForSingleObject( pi.hProcess, INFINITE );     CloseHandle( pi.hProcess );     CloseHandle( pi.hThread ); </code></pre>  <p>PD: 1) It is assumed that you can use CreateProcess () for this purpose, I should not do it with ShellExecute () or system(). 2) I have read about it in the forum and can not find a solution to this error, there are many answers to similar questions but do not address the error, other functions are proposed, or mix with the route command. 3) I do not think that issue permits because I built while the manifest. 4) I currently use C ++ Builder, in win7, 32bits but not important. 5) I guess the issue will be voted as negative and duplicate (as usual) but the proposed testing examples also receive errors. Thanks to all</p>
