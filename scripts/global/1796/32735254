<p>I have a simple C# console application which writes some information to a text file. The application works fine when opened from desktop (by clicking on the .exe file). However when I open the application via command prompt, the console window will open normally but the application won't write anything to the text file (the other code functions work normally in the console window). </p>  <p>Fyi I need to open the application via command prompt because later on the exe application will be put on server and called from a php script (using exec or shell_exec). </p>  <p>I assume this might be an issue with write permissions or something, but no error is thrown at any point so I'm not sure. Any ideas please?</p>  <p>My code:</p>  <pre><code>    static void Main(string[] args)     {         string arg="";         try         {             arg = args[0];         }         catch {          }         using (StreamWriter outputWriter = File.AppendText(@"C:\Archive\test.txt"))         {             outputWriter.WriteLine("arg="+arg);         }         Console.WriteLine("Test");         Console.ReadLine();     } </code></pre>
