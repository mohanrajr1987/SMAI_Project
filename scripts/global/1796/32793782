<p>I'm extremely new to the command line and just programming in general. I use windows, and I'm doing prep work for viking code school. In one of the lessons it asks us to use the 'open' command in Git Bash (we were to download Git Bash if we weren't on Linux or Mac) which will not work for me. When I type it, I get the error "bash: open: command not found", how can I fix this or work around it? Thank you</p>
