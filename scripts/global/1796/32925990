<p>I am using Laravel 5s command bus for the first time, to add a function to many of my controllers. Although the code works up to a point, I keep getting the same error; the object I am passing to the command doesn't have its type defined. Here's what I mean: </p>  <p>Here we have a controller which does two things; it grabs my news data from the database (related to a particular 'act' in this case), and then uses a function to add a specific set of images. </p>  <p>NewsController.php </p>  <pre><code>    public function edit(Act $act, News $news, Image $image)  {     $object = $news;     $command = new ActImages(                $act,                $object              );     $images_array = $this-&gt;dispatch(        $command        );          $images_used = $images_array[0];        return view('admin.news.edit', compact('act', 'news'))      -&gt;with('images_used', $images_used)      ; </code></pre>  <p>as you can see, the news object (defined in my News model with a one to many relationship to Images) is passed to the command as '$object'. Now here is the Command :</p>  <p>ActImages.php (command)</p>  <pre><code>    &lt;?php  namespace App\Commands;  // use App\Commands\Command; use Illuminate\Contracts\Bus\SelfHandling; use App\Image; use App\News;  class ActImages implements SelfHandling { public $object; /**  * Create a new command instance.  *  * @return void  */ public function __construct(Act $act, $object) {    $image_object = $object-&gt;image()-&gt;lists('image_id');   $images_used = array();   foreach ($image_object as $value) {     array_push($images_used, $value);   } $this-&gt;images_used = $images_used;     // it all works up until this point. dd($this); returns the correct information }   /**  * Execute the command.  *  * @return void  */ public function handle() {     return array(       $this-&gt;images_used     );   } } </code></pre>  <p>The problem is for this command to be of use I have to pass it a different object ($object) each time. But the above code gives me this error : </p>  <blockquote>   <p>BindingResolutionException in Container.php line 823:   Unresolvable dependency resolving [Parameter #1 [ required $object ]] in class >App\Commands\ActImages</p> </blockquote>  <p>I can see that $object is not defined as a specific object (it would be easy to say (News $object) in this instance), but that doesn't help me when I have to use this image command in one of my other many controllers.... (the images are also displayed for "Venues" and "Events" for example. </p>  <p>So do I need to define a 'general' object when I set up my command? How do I do that? </p>  <p>I have tried (Object $object) and (Array $object), but the former refers to a specific named object which doesn't exist, and the latter refers to an Array, which works, but it doesn't help me! Please help!</p>
