<p>I want to search zip files in directory based on pattern and have to list out in .txt file e.g. I am having abc.zip and abc123.zip(123 can be any random numbers)  My code</p>  <pre><code>For %%F in [fullpath]\abc*.zip Do @Echo %%~ftF&gt;&gt; test.txt </code></pre>  <p>(enclosed in batch file) gives me output as </p>  <pre><code>[modified date][fullpath]abc.zip [modified date][fullpath]abc123.zip </code></pre>  <p>Now the twist here is, I want to list out only      abc123.zip      and not      abc.zip And I cannot give pattern like abc123*.zip, as 123 can be any random numbers and they are not fixed. Thanks</p>
