<p>I want to run a batch file but I have a problem. The content of test.bat is :</p>  <pre><code>echo on for /f "tokens=2 delims= " %%i in ('ping -n 1 proxy ^| find /I /N "Pinging"') do set USED_PROXY_SERVER=%%i @echo Your are using the following Proxy=%USED_PROXY_SERVER% </code></pre>  <p>It told me </p>  <pre><code>'ping -n 1 proxy ^| find /I /N "Pinging"' is not recognized as an internal or external command </code></pre>  <p>The ping and find command can be used in command line.</p>  <p>Thanks a lot.</p>
