<p>I am trying to use the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/186592" rel="nofollow">query</a> terminal server command, but Perl keeps coming back with this error:</p>  <pre><code>    'query' is not recognized as an internal or external command,     operable program or batch file. </code></pre>  <p>If I enter the query command directly into the command prompt I am able to use it, however all of these attempts via Perl result in the above error:</p>  <pre><code>    exec("query /help");     system("query /help");     `query /help`; </code></pre>  <p>I'm guessing it has to do with the way Perl creates a new shell to send commands. Is there a way to have it send directly within the same command shell I am executing the Perl script in?</p>
