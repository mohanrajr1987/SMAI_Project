<p>There is a need to quickly open the current directory from the command prompt. I know that there is a command <code>explorer</code>.</p>  <p>But to enter the full path to the directory is very inconvenient.Â </p>  <p>For example: </p>  <pre><code>exoplorer c:\progra~1\nodejs~1\worskp~1\project\module\convert </code></pre>  <p>It works. But is that the faster you can open the folder with the mouse ... I think it's not right.</p>  <p>And this command: </p>  <pre><code>explorer cd. </code></pre>  <p>Opens <code>My Documents</code>. Although I am in a different directory.</p>  <p>Whether prompt me please!</p>
