<p>Is there a way to block anyone from write something in the console while the command is running?</p>  <p>With this part of code, a new window is shown until the command finish but the problem is that I can write a new command or something else in the first window. The script will be used by other persons, and usually they close all Windows when just arrived without caring if it turns or not! Please is there someone who had an idea? I tried several codes but no solution.</p>  <p>By the way I need the output in real time to get status.</p>  <p>Thank you in advance </p>  <pre><code>Set oSh = CreateObject("WScript.Shell") STR="%comspec% /c touchad status" SET objExec = oSh.Exec(STR) WHILE objExec.Status &lt;&gt; WshFinished WEND Stri= objExec.StdOut.ReadAll i= instrRev(Stri,"RUNNING") </code></pre>
