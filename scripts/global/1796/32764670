<p>I need to execute this sort of command through the Go programming language:</p>  <p><code>find /some/dir/path -type f \( -iname \*.zip -o -iname \*.tar -o -iname \*.rar \)</code></p>  <p>I discovered exec.Command and tried various ways of executing the <code>find</code> command, e.g.</p>  <pre><code>exec.Command("find", dir, "-type", "f", "\\( -iname \\*.zip -o -iname \\*.tar -o -iname \\*.rar \\)") exec.Command("find", dir, "-type", "f", "-iname", "*.zip", "-o", "-iname", "*.tar", "-o", "-iname", "*.rar") exec.Command("find", dir, "-type", "f", "\\(", "-iname", "\\*.zip", "-o", "-iname", "\\*.tar", "-o", "-iname", "\\*.rar", "\\)") </code></pre>  <p>None of the above have worked for me.  Is there a way to do this, or am I just going to have to issue 3 separate find commands in Go?</p>
