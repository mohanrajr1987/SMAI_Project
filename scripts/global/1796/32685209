<p>I'm having a weird problem. My commands don't read .txt files that I'm saving from Excel. I've tried to save the data in all the available .txt formats available in Excel, but when I run a command it does not read it. Actually it seems to read the first line of the file, but only if the first line of the file contains <code>Parcela 1</code>. If I create a plain .txt file from text editor though, it reads it no matter how many lines.  </p>  <p>Does anyone know what I am doing wrong?</p>  <p>One of my codes:</p>  <pre><code>awk -F"\t" ' { if ($7 ~ /Parcela 1/)     print; else }' source.txt &gt; output.txt </code></pre>
