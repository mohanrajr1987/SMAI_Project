<p>So this is the command I am using </p>  <pre><code>javadoc -author -private -version -sourcepath /home/linux/ieng6/cs12f/cs12/HW1/Dictionary.java -d /home/linux/ieng6/cs12f/cs12/HW1/doc </code></pre>  <p>and it comes with the error saying no packages or class specified. I'm not sure what package it's in, I honestly didn't even know there was a package, it's just a java file in a directory.</p>
