<p>I'm trying to run an extremely simple bash script that runs some commands on the shell. For now, all it is composed of is:</p>  <pre><code>#!/bin/bash  eos </code></pre>  <p>Where "eos" is a perfectly legit command that runs perfectly fine on the server I'm using if I run it manually on the same shell.</p>  <p>However, when I chmod +x and execute this script, I get the error:</p>  <pre><code>./cp.sh: line 21: eos: command not found </code></pre>  <p>Does anyone have any idea why it won't submit these commands?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
