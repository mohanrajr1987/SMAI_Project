<p>heads up – I am still a noobie with the server administration but we have a Virtual Server set up (one IP address) and hosting multiple domains (administration is done through ISP). But I would like to know how to set up a default site to show when our IP (or any website directed to our IPs without actual content on it) is put into browser. Now, when I put our IP into the browser, one of hosted webpages shows and I cannot figure out where to change it. When I trace my ghosts (apachectl -t -D DUMP_VHOSTS), i get this:</p>  <p>XX.XX.XX.XX:80       is a NameVirtualHost</p>  <pre><code>     default server WEB.COM (/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/100-WEB.COM.vhost:6)      port 80 namevhost WEB.COM (/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/100-WEB.COM.vhost:6)              alias www.WEB.COM      port 80 namevhost ANOTHER.COM (/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/100-ANOTHER.COM.vhost:6)              alias WWW.ANOTHER.COM </code></pre>  <p>– instead of XX.XX.XX.XX (I have our server's IP address) – WEB.COM is the website (content) showing overtime I target our IP address or domain without content directed to our server – ANOTHER.COM and so on are other results of DUMP_VHOSTS command</p>  <p>Please, any advice? I've already gone through various posts and possible solutions, but couldn't find the correct one.</p>  <p>Thans in advance!</p>
