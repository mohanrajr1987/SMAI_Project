<p>Allright so I have a website where I want traffic to go from</p>  <pre><code>http -&gt; https non www -&gt; www </code></pre>  <p>So the final url should look like: <code>https://www.x.net</code> I set up some rewrite rules in my htaccess, which look like the following:</p>  <pre><code>RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^www\. RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://www.%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI}$1 [R=301,L]  RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI}$1 </code></pre>  <p>It works fine, everything gets redirected but the only problem is the following type of urls. </p>  <pre><code>x.com/help </code></pre>  <p>What happens is it will redirect to </p>  <pre><code>https://www.x.comhelp </code></pre>  <p>It removes the slash between com and help, I couldn't find an answer on Google so that's why I though, maybe my StackOverflow friend could help me out :)</p>
