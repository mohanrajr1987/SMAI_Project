<p>In apache2, we only allowed contact with our company wiki from the headquarters ip address.  Headquarters moved and we lost our network guru at the same time.  Not familiar with this stuff, I'm trying to open the wiki to any ip address.  </p>  <p>In wiki.ourdomain.com.conf I found this line:      Require ip 123.456.789.123   (actual numbers not shown) I commented the line out with # so it now reads      # Require ip 123.456.789.123</p>  <p>Nevertheless, I can't reach the wiki from <em>any</em> ip address. Where else should I be looking to defeat this blockage?</p>
