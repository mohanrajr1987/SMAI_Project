<p>I'd wanted to make my own web server and make it accessible from the internet. I don't want any domain, I'm OK to use ip-address.</p>  <p>So I just followed this tutorial: <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-apache-mysql-php-lamp-stack-on-ubuntu-14-04" rel="nofollow">https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-apache-mysql-php-lamp-stack-on-ubuntu-14-04</a></p>  <p>I just wanted to know that if I'll follow this complicated tutorial will my server will be accessible from the internet?</p>  <p>I've gone through this page several times but I din't understood that will it be accessible from the internet or not.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
