<p>I have to host nodejs app. Nodejs server listening on 8081 and I want all the request which comes to *:80 (with server name test.com) goes to nodejs server. </p>  <p>I followed the steps:</p>  <p>1) in test.com.conf file in /etc/apache2/sites-available </p>  <pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt; ServerAdmin admin@example.com ServerName test.com ServerAlias www.test.com  ProxyRequests off  &lt;Proxy *&gt;     Order deny,allow     Allow from all &lt;/Proxy&gt;  &lt;Location /&gt;     ProxyPass http://192.168.1.3:8081/     ProxyPassReverse http://192.168.1.3:8081/ &lt;/Location&gt; &lt;/VirtualHost&gt; </code></pre>  <p>2) Enabled site with ensite2 </p>  <p>But it still doesn't work.Apart from these I did not change anything. What am I doing wrong?</p>
