<p>I created a custom module for Apache2.4 that uses an external library (MagickWand). I installed it using <code>sudo apt-get install libmagickwand-dev</code>, but now, what I have to do in order to use it with Apache2.4? When I restart the apache2 service I got the undefined symbol error about a function on MagickWand. I read that I should load the shared object of the library, but how can I create it? Using apxs? Where? </p>  <p>Thank you very much in advance!</p>
