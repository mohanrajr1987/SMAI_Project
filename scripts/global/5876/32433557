<p>The download method I am using:</p>  <ul> <li>I have a "Export" button in HTML which when clicked sends some data to the server.</li> <li>The server processes the data, writes the CSV to a file and whether the writing was successful or not, sends an appropriate JSON message.</li> <li>On receiving a success message, I do a <code>window.open</code> with the proper url and attached file name to start the download.</li> <li>The download <strong>happens</strong> on Firefox in Ubuntu 15.04 alright as well as IE 11 on Windows 7.</li> </ul>  <p>However the download <strong>fails</strong> on Google Chrome 45.0.2454.85 m on Windows 7. It just opens a new blank window and then nothing happens. I have browser cache cleared. What is the right way to start a file download for Chrome?</p>  <p>Here is the PHP code responsible for the download.</p>  <pre><code>header("Content-Description: File Transfer"); header("Content-Type: text/csv"); header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=". basename($filename)); header("Expires: 0"); header("Cache-Control: must-revalidate"); header("Pragma: public"); header("Content-Length: ". filesize($filename)); ob_clean(); flush(); readFile($filename); </code></pre>
