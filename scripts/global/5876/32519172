<p>I followed <a href="https://switch2osm.org/serving-tiles/manually-building-a-tile-server-14-04/" rel="nofollow">this</a> link to host an OSM tile server. But once I reach the last step which is rendering the tiles </p>  <p>sudo -u username renderd -f -c /usr/local/etc/renderd.conf </p>  <p>I get this </p>  <blockquote>   <p>An error occurred while loading the map layer 'default': Could not create datasource for type: 'shape'  encountered during parsing of layer 'land-low' in Layer at line 48 of '/usr/local/share/maps/style/OSMBright/OSMBright.xml'renderd[2728]: An error occurred while loading the map layer 'default': Could not create datasource for type: 'shape'  encountered during parsing of layer 'land-low' in Layer at line 48 of '/usr/local/share/maps/style/OSMBright/OSMBright.xml'</p>      <p>renderd[2728]: An error occurred while loading the map layer 'default': Could not create datasource for type: 'shape'  encountered during parsing of layer 'land-low' in Layer at line 48 of '/usr/local/share/maps/style/OSMBright/OSMBright.xml'   renderd[2728]: An error occurred while loading the map layer 'default': Could not create datasource for type: 'shape'  encountered during parsing of layer 'land-low' in Layer at line 48 of '/usr/local/share/maps/style/OSMBright/OSMBright.xml'</p> </blockquote>  <p>and then try to open localhost/open_tiles/0.0.0.png </p>  <p>I get 'page not found' and </p>  <blockquote>   <p>renderd[2728]: DEBUG: Got incoming connection, fd 7, number 1   renderd[2728]: DEBUG: Got incoming request with protocol version 2   renderd[2728]: DEBUG: Got command RenderPrio fd(7) xml(default), z(0), x(0), y(0), mime(image/png), options()   renderd[2728]: Received request for map layer 'default' which failed to load   renderd[2728]: DEBUG: Sending render cmd(4 default 0/0/0) with protocol version 2 to fd 7   renderd[2728]: DEBUG: Failed to read cmd on fd 7   renderd[2728]: DEBUG: Connection 0, fd 7 closed, now 0 left</p> </blockquote>  <p>I am pretty sure I did all the configuration and the steps mentioned correct. I infact repeated the steps thrice over and still cant get past this error. Please help...</p>
