<p>Picking up a test system with apache + tomcat. It was supposed to work but has been not working for a while.</p>  <p>If I start Tomcat first, then when starting apache it will show the following error:</p>  <p>[warn] NameVirtualHost *:8081 has no VirtualHosts (98)Address already in use: make_sock: could not bind to address 0.0.0.0:8081 no listening sockets available, shutting down</p>  <p>If I start Apache first, then start Tomcat, I will see the java exception saying port 8081 has been used already and Tomcat won't start.</p>  <p>What's the correct way to integrate apache2 and tomcat7? Where do I may be missing in the current setup? thanks.</p>
