<p>I'm having an issue where browser-sync is not properly proxying my apache2 server. I'm running browser-sync through gulp within an Ubuntu 14.04 VM with Ubuntu 15.04 on the host. I'm using the following configuration:</p>  <pre><code>browserSync({     proxy: 'localhost:80',     port: '8081',     open: false }); </code></pre>  <p>The guest machine's port 80 is mapped to 8080 on the host. The gulp task runs without issue and I get the expected output from browser-sync. If I visit localhost:8081/index.php, it works without any issue. If I try to visit localhost:8081/foo/index.php, however, my browser is redirecting to localhost:8080/foo/index.php, and browser-sync does not function. </p>  <p>If I set logLevel to debug, I see output when I visit localhost:8081/index.php:</p>  <p>[BS] Browser Connected: Chrome, version: 45.0.2454.85</p>  <p>There is no output, however, when I visit localhost:8081/foo/index.php</p>  <p>Is there a bug with browser-sync when used within a VM?</p>
