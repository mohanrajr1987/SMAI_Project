<p>I never changed anything and now suddenly my apache2 appears to be creating hundreds of instances which all consume my servers CPU thus increasing loads times to deadly slow.  I've never had this happen before, one of my friends told me to update everything on the server with some commands and I did that.  Aside from being told what to do, I'm completely new to anything server related (always had someone do it for me.)  </p>  <p>How can I go about figuring out why this is caused and how to fix it?</p>
