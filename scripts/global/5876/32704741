<p>I'm creating a repository for a brand new project (no files yet) using this tutorial:</p>  <p><a href="https://bdhacker.wordpress.com/2012/01/11/create-svn-repository-in-ubuntu-access-via-http/" rel="nofollow">https://bdhacker.wordpress.com/2012/01/11/create-svn-repository-in-ubuntu-access-via-http/</a></p>  <p>and everything seems to have gone well. I was able to access the new repository via browser at <a href="http://my-ip-address/svn/myproject" rel="nofollow">http://my-ip-address/svn/myproject</a></p>  <p>However, when I try to checkout the project in my home directory on Ubuntu with the command</p>  <pre><code>svn co http://localhost/svn/myproject </code></pre>  <p>I get an error:</p>  <pre><code>&gt; svn: E170000: 'http://localhost/svn/myproject' isn't in the same &gt; repository as 'http://localhost/svn/myproject/myproject' </code></pre>  <p>I've also tried the checkout command specifying a directory, a username, a password, and all combinations getting the same error.</p>  <p>For some reason, the repository name is listed like it's nested or something and I'm not sure why.</p>  <p>My /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/myproject.conf has:</p>  <pre><code>    &lt;Location /svn&gt;      DAV svn      SVNParentPath /svn/repos/      AuthType Basic      AuthName "Test Repository"      AuthUserFile /etc/svnpasswd      Require valid-user    &lt;/Location&gt; </code></pre>  <p>If you need any other info I'll be happy to provide it. The only thing I could dig up about that specific error code was usually about trying to access it via <a href="http://user:pass@localhost/svn/myproject" rel="nofollow">http://user:pass@localhost/svn/myproject</a> or some other form of that access, which is not was I was attempting to do.</p>
