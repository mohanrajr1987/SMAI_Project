<p>I have the following code to write to a file.</p>  <pre><code>$ics_file   = "/var/www/Untis/ICS/$ID.ics";  if (is_writable($ics_file)) {   if (!$handle = fopen($ics_file, 'c')) {      echo "Cannot open file ($ics_file)\n\n";      exit;   }   if (fwrite($handle, $ics_contents) === FALSE) {     echo "Cannot write to file ($ics_file)\n\n";     exit;   }   fclose($handle); } else {   echo "The file &lt;b&gt;$ics_file&lt;/b&gt; is not writable\n\n"; } </code></pre>  <p>This code only works if a manually create the file and then chmod it to 777 from the terminal. However I have already made the directory in which it's writing, 777 and I changed the group to www-data.</p>  <pre><code>pi@raspberrypi /var/www/Untis $ ls -all total 44 drwxrwxrwx 2 pi   www-data 4096 Sep 27 20:49 ICS </code></pre>  <p>However I'm still unable to write in there. The error I'm getting is:</p>  <p>The file <strong>/var/www/Untis/ICS/CTE152B.ics</strong> is not writable. </p>  <p>I'm currently clueless why its not working for new files, if I chmod the dir to 777 php should be able to write in there right?</p>
