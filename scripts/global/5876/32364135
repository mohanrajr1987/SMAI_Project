<p>I have multiple droplets at digitalocean.com, webservers, loadbalancer, and mailserver.</p>  <p>Now I just installed mailinabox, and I want to move it behind my standalone loadbalancer server (NGINX). I have setup the correct dns settings, copied the ssl keys, and copied the nginx conf and configured it so everything almost works..</p>  <p>The problem is that locations as ex. /cloud/ has an alias to /usr/local/lib/.., and i want to access these on the mailserver from my nginx server.</p>  <p>Now both of them have private networking, so I don't see any security issues doing this. I'm also going to ghost most of my servers so they have to be accessed by nginx.</p>  <p>Does anyone know how to deal with these local aliases? And how can I setup my mailserver so it sends mail through nginx, I suppose it has to be forwarded through nginx if i want to use the same domain name?</p>
