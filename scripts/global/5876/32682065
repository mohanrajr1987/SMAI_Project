<p>I have a site, that performs some heavy calculations, using library for symbolic math.</p>  <p>Currently average calculation time is 5 seconds.</p>  <p>I know, that ask too broad question, but nevertheless, what is the optimized configuration for this type of sites? What server is best for this?</p>  <p>Currently, I'm using Apache with mod_wsgi, but I don't know how to correctly configure it.</p>  <p>On average site is receiving 40 requests per second.</p>  <p>How many processes, threads, MaxClients etc. should I set? </p>  <p>Maybe, it is better to use nginx/uwsgi/gunicorn (I'm using python as programming language)?</p>  <p>Anyway, any info is highly appreciated.</p>
