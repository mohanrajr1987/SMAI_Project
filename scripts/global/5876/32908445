<p>Sorry if this is a really silly question but I'm quite new to apache and server programming. I've set up apache and it points to ~/Sites in my home directory. The CGI script is stored in my Dropbox folder (as I like to keep it backed up in several places). I want to create an alias for that file that apache will run in my ~/Sites folder but I've been unsuccessful so far. </p>  <p>I've tried creating an alias for the file but when I try to run it I get an internal server error.</p>  <p>I've tried creating another cgi program in the ~/Sites directory that calls the file in my Dropbox folder but that wan't successful either.</p>  <p>Is this possible?</p>
