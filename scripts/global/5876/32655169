<p>I have a simple php script that connects to a database and performs a simple query.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php $servername = "localhost"; $username = "root"; $password = ""; $dbname = "cacat";  // Create connection $conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname); // Check connection if ($conn-&gt;connect_error) {     die("Connection failed: " . $conn-&gt;connect_error); }   $sql = "INSERT INTO cacati (firstname, lastname, email) VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 'john@example.com')";  if ($conn-&gt;query($sql) === TRUE) {     echo "New record created successfully"; } else {     echo "Error: " . $sql . "&lt;br&gt;" . $conn-&gt;error; }  $conn-&gt;close(); </code></pre>  <p>The problem is that, if i run the file above, it will display the success message but in the database i will have 3 same entries.</p>  <p>I don't think that is a php specific problem or mysql because the above code works well on production.</p>  <p>My local development is a Mac OS Yosemite with ZendServer installed and php 5.6.10.</p>  <p>Thank you!</p>  <p>EDIT:</p>  <p>I uninstalled ZendServer and installed MAMP and now it inserts 2 entries at once (duplicates) instead of 3 like in ZendServer. I guess it's something to do with apache conflicts or php but i think i disabled the build in apache. Any advices?</p>  <p><strong>LAST EDIT:</strong></p>  <p>Thanks to Michael Berkowski that suggested to look at the browser network inspector to see why are 2 request on page load, i found out that the second entry in the database was caused by the favicon.icon request of the browser.</p>  <p>Creating a simple favicon.ico on the root of the project solved the problem.</p>  <p>Thank you again for your answers!</p>
