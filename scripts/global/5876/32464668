<p>I'm using ubuntu server 14.40 on a VPS. I installed apache2, mysql, php5 and phpmyadmin. I created a database and a user with access to it.  Also installed nodejs 0.12.7 with npm.</p>  <p>So, my website is showing Erreur SQL : Erreur SQL : Erreur SQL : Erreur SQL : Erreur SQL : Erreur SQL : but there's no message in it.</p>  <p>There's nothing into the mysql error log, and in the apache2 error log there's only these lines :</p>  <blockquote>   <p>PHP Notice:  Undefined index: steamid in /var/www/html/index.php on line 21</p>      <p>PHP Notice:  Undefined variable: steamprofile in /var/www/html/index.php on line 46</p>      <p>PHP Notice:  Undefined variable: steamprofile in /var/www/html/index.php on line 47</p>      <p>PHP Notice:  A session had already been started - ignoring session_start() in /var/www/html/online.php on line 2</p> </blockquote>  <p>But i don't think that the problem comes from it. The fact is : my website worked perfectly good, i launched my steam bot (nodejs file), and it looked like mysql did crash which made crash my bot and these errors suddenly appeared 1 hour after. I've created a backup so i decided to uninstall ubuntu and install it again but the problem is still present? It looks to come from my configuration so... or maybe cookies or something?</p>
