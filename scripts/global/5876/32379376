<p>I've got this idea in my head. My hosting automatically turns subdirectories into subdomains which is cool. I was wondering what steps I would need to take to:</p>  <ul> <li>Allow users to have their own /subdirectory</li> <li>Only allow there to be an index.html file in it</li> <li>Disable PHP execution</li> </ul>  <p>Of course make sure nobody overwrites a pre-existing subdirectory.  Would it be possible to make a user backend where they sign in, register their site, and then can edit it?</p>
