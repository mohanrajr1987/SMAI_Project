<p>Im trying to run a website on both port 80 and 1998 on apache2 and inn sites-avaible my config looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;     # The ServerName directive sets the request scheme, hostname and port that     # the server uses to identify itself. This is used when creating     # redirection URLs. In the context of virtual hosts, the ServerName     # specifies what hostname must appear in the request's Host: header to     # match this virtual host. For the default virtual host (this file) this     # value is not decisive as it is used as a last resort host regardless.     # However, you must set it for any further virtual host explicitly.     #ServerName www.example.com      ServerAdmin admin@mafiakampen.com     DocumentRoot /var/www/html/mv      # Available loglevels: trace8, ..., trace1, debug, info, notice, warn,     # error, crit, alert, emerg.     # It is also possible to configure the loglevel for particular     # modules, e.g.     #LogLevel info ssl:warn      ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log     CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined      # For most configuration files from conf-available/, which are     # enabled or disabled at a global level, it is possible to     # include a line for only one particular virtual host. For example the     # following line enables the CGI configuration for this host only     # after it has been globally disabled with "a2disconf".     #Include conf-available/serve-cgi-bin.conf &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;  # vim: syntax=apache ts=4 sw=4 sts=4 sr noet  &lt;VirtualHost *:1998&gt;     # The ServerName directive sets the request scheme, hostname and port that     # the server uses to identify itself.
