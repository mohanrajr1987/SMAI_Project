<p>I have an AngularJS (1.4.5) website that is placed on a apache2 server with a small NodeJS instance that serves the communication with the backend and also hosts the website, I use apache2 <code>sites-available.conf</code> file for redirecting the port</p>  <p>The URL looks like this today:</p>  <pre><code>http://prod.mywebsiteurl.com/myapp/#/mp </code></pre>  <p>The last path is dynamic, when the Angular app is started, it takes the last parameter with: (I've configured this with $routeProvider                 </p>  <pre><code>dynamicUrl = $routeParams.dynamicUrl; </code></pre>  <p>in the <code>init()</code> function.</p>  <p>When I enable <code>html5mode</code> with:</p>  <pre><code>$locationProvider.html5Mode(true); </code></pre>  <p>I can't access the website:</p>  <pre><code>http://prod.mywebsiteurl.com/myapp/mp </code></pre>  <p>It gives an apache2 error.</p>  <pre><code>Cannot GET /MP (404) </code></pre>  <p>However, if I type the old address, with the <code>#</code> it redirects to the site <strong>without</strong> the <code>#</code>.</p>  <p>Any idea how to solve this? Is this a apache2 configuration? If so? How do I do it? I am a real apache2 noob. </p>  <p>I think I have to have a .htaccess file and use this little rewrite rule.</p>  <pre><code>RewriteEngine On     # If an existing asset or directory is requested go to it as it is   RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}%{REQUEST_URI} -f [OR]   RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}%{REQUEST_URI} -d   RewriteRule ^ - [L]    # If the requested resource doesn't exist, use index.html   RewriteRule ^ /index.html </code></pre>  <p>I found it on this page: <a href="https://ngmilk.rocks/2015/03/09/angularjs-html5-mode-or-pretty-urls-on-apache-using-htaccess/" rel="nofollow">https://ngmilk.rocks/2015/03/09/angularjs-html5-mode-or-pretty-urls-on-apache-using-htaccess/</a></p>  <p>But I'm using a Node as the webserver, so I really don't know where to place the file, the server is a Ubuntu server. I placed it in the NodeJS root, but that did not seem to work very well.</p>  <p>Any help appreciated.</p>
