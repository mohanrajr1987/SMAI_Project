<p>I have a Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS server running apache2. I have set the ServerName in the necessary files. to do this i have followed this tutorial: <a href="http://code.tutsplus.com/articles/apache-2-basic-configuration-on-unix-like-systems--net-26607" rel="nofollow">http://code.tutsplus.com/articles/apache-2-basic-configuration-on-unix-like-systems--net-26607</a></p>  <p>I have also set the A-record of the DNS of the domain to point to the ip adress of my server</p>  <p>just www.mysite.com or www.mysite.com/page.html works fine but when the page I try to acces is an index file in its own directory, www.mysite.com/dir, it redirects to xx.xx.xxx.xx/dir. it does display the page correctly but for some reason it doesn't want to show the domain name.</p>  <p>can anyone help or point me in the right direction, I have searched on the internet but was unable to find anything useful.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
