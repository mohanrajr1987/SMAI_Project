<p>I have 2 terminal windows, T1 and T2. T1 runs a monitor application and has to run full time.</p>  <p>T2 (a bash script) is used to control T1 and to tell T1 to start a scan. My problem is that I want to write a script which starts a scan, but i need to know when the scan is done in order to continue the script in T2 properly.</p>  <p>When starting the scan the only feedback is in T1, when the scan is done T1 says "Succuess...", in T2 there is no feedback.</p>  <p>Is there a way to write a script to read out the success message of T1?</p>  <p>Cheers</p>
