<p>I was researching libimobiledevice to basically capture the specific iPhone app logs. I have tried with the <code>idevicesyslog</code> command, but it gives me all the system logs along with my app.</p>  <p>I tried with  <code>idevicesyslog -d | grep com.example.Example</code> but does not give me the info I am looking for.</p>  <p>I am interested in the debug logs of my app.</p>  <p>I know there is a way to capture it from the organizer in Xcode but I don't want to do it that way. I am planning to do it programmatically and then integrate with Appium automation script.</p>
