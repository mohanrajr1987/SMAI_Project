<p>I am writing a C++ program, which runs a long data analysis algorithm. It takes several days to finish running, so it is useful to have a prompt which outputs the "percentage complete" every time a new loop in the program starts so that the user (me) knows the computer isn't sitting in an infinite loop somewhere or has crashed.</p>  <p>At the moment I am doing this the most basic way, by computing the percentage complete as a floating point number and doing:</p>  <pre><code>std::cout &lt;&lt; "Percentage complete: " &lt;&lt; percentage_complete &lt;&lt; " %" &lt;&lt; std::endl; </code></pre>  <p>But, when the program has a million loops to run, this is kind of messy. In addition, if the terminal scrollback is only 1000 lines, then I lose the initial debug info printed out at the start once the program is 0.1 % complete.</p>  <p>I would like to copy an idea I have seen in other programs, where instead of writing a new line each time with the percentage complete, I simply replace the last line written to the terminal with the new percentage complete.</p>  <p>How can I do this? Is that possible? And if so, can this be done in a cross platform way? Are there several methods of doing this?</p>  <p>I am unsure how to describe what I am trying to do perfectly clearly, so I hope that this clear enough that you understand what I am trying to do.</p>  <p>To clarify, rather than seeing this:</p>  <pre><code>Running program. Debug info: Total number of loops: 1000000  Percentage complete: 0 % Percentage complete: 0.001 % Percentage complete: 0.002 % . . . Percentage complete: 1.835 % </code></pre>  <p>I would like to see this:</p>  <pre><code>Running program. Debug info: Total number of loops: 1000000  Percentage complete: 1.835 % </code></pre>  <p>And then on the next loop the terminal should update to this:</p>  <pre><code>Running program. Debug info: Total number of loops: 1000000  Percentage complete: 1.836 % </code></pre>  <p>I hope that's enough information.</p>  <p>(Okay, so this output would actually be for 100000 steps, not 1000000.)</p>
