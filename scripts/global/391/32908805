<p>I ran <code>ls -la</code> on mac terminal and i got below output :</p>  <pre><code>rwxr-xr-x  4 user  staff   136 Oct  2 18:55 . drwxr-xr-x  6 user  staff   204 Aug 23 11:39 .. -rw-r--r--  1 user  staff  2622 Oct  2 18:03 File2.php -rw-r--r--@ 1 user  staff   392 Oct  2 19:14 File1.php  #        ^  #        this one here </code></pre>  <p>If you see the permission for <code>File1.php</code>, there is an <code>@</code> at the end.What is the significance / meaning of this <code>@</code> sign here? <br />If it is of any worth, file1 is created through dreamweaver application.</p>  <p>Not sure what <em>keyword</em> to use to google it, tried some, found nothing so come to last resort! :)</p>
