<p>I am trying to install OSX El Capitan . The traditional way just going to the Mac App Store it s not working ( I tried several times (5times) and the download it s ALWAYS stopping at 1.79GB, with deleting the download, restarting the laptop, running Command+R to check the hard drive - same result).     After that, I found out that i can download/update with Terminal. I run <code>softwareupdate -l</code> but it`s finding other software to be updated but NOT El Capitan.      I have a MacBook pro 13 inch with retina , with OSX Yosemite 10.10.5 running on it</p>
