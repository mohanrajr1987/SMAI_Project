<p>I'm trying to run a nodeJS service that contains some parameters, then once it is running, stores a lot of session variables. My script shouldn't be restarted because of this, all these working variables should remain the same.</p>  <p>Is it possible to change some global variables inside the running nodejs script while it is running? I was hoping the node would actually be a console where I can run JS in it but it appear it is not, it only outputs the console.log() method and errors, there's no input.</p>  <p>I know I could create a method inside my script to change these variables, but there are many, and I dont want to create a function that can handle them all because this would be very insecure.</p>  <p>Is there something I've missed about the node console inside terminal? In fine, the script will be running with 'forever'</p>
