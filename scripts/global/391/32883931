<p>I know that I can open my <code>.bash_profile</code> and enter the following lines to customize the LScolors of the Terminal, but that's not what I'm trying to do.</p>  <pre><code>export CLICOLOR=1 export LSCOLORS=GxFxCxDxBxegedabagaced </code></pre>  <p>For readability, I would be really interested in a system whereby I can set a different color for commands that I have written, versus responses from the system. So in essence I would be typing in white, and then the responses come back in a variety of colours.</p>  <p>So for example, let's say I'm using git, and I want to check my git status. The git status text that I type into the prompt would come up in white as I press the keys, and then the response from git would be green or red or whatever depending on files that are checked in, or untracked or whatever.</p>
