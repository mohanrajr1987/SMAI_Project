<p>Originally I used Cloud 9 to git add --all, git commit, an git push to my GH Pages repository.  I am switching to Brackets because I will eventually go over Cloud 9's limited storage for free users.</p>  <p>I tried looking at Github's <a href="https://pages.github.com/" rel="nofollow">tutorial</a>, but they are starting from scratch and I already have my own project.</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
