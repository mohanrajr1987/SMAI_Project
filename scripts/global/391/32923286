<p>I have made some changes in a file and I broke it at some point. I have all the version control in bitbucket.</p>  <p>When I try: <code>git status</code>, I get  <code>modified:resources/views/app.blade.php</code> however I don't want to commit it, instead I wanna bring back the working version. I didn't push the broken version, so the last one on git is the working version.</p>  <p>What is the command necessary for me to ignoring all the last changes I have made on my local?</p>  <p>Will <code>git pull origin working branch</code> work? I want to ignore all the latest changes that I made on my local for only that single file (<code>app.blade.php</code>) that I didn't push yet, and pull the latest working version from git. </p>  <p>Something like <code>git ignore last changes that I made on app.blade.php &amp; pull the working version of app.blade.php</code> <em>the latest pushed version on git is the working one, i didn't push broken one</em>.</p>
