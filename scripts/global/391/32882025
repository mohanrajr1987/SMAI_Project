<p>I'm using terminal in Android Studio and normally it's working proper. But when I enter SQLite command mode by "adb shell" and (Up, Down, Left, Right) Keys are not working to navigate to call recently used sqlite command. When I press those keys, the symbols like the following are appeared. Please help.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/kDzd3.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/kDzd3.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
