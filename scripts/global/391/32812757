<p>I was wondering if someone here could help me troubleshoot this problem or at least guide me to the proper channel. I installed it.</p>  <pre><code>sudo dnf install beep </code></pre>  <p>If you just type in</p>  <pre><code>beep </code></pre>  <p>it wont make any sound. It wont make any sound even if you do it in root. some person on the net answering this question a few years back suggested to type in</p>  <pre><code>sudo modprobe -v pcspkr </code></pre>  <p>But this still didn't work. I'm completely lost. please help.</p>
