<p>I'm trying to change my bash prompt and it isn't working for me. Nothing I try is working and I don't know why.</p>  <p>I deleted my .bash_* files and started fresh with a .bash_profile.</p>  <p>Inside .bash_profile I added the script:</p>  <pre><code>echo "PS1 is currently: $PS1" export PS1=" " echo "PS1 after export: $PS1" </code></pre>  <p>When restarting my prompt, I get:</p>  <pre><code>PS1 is currently: \h:\W \u\$  PS1 after export:   [15:59][boonie@bunhill][~]$ echo $PS1 \[\]\[\][\[\]$(date +%H:%M)\[\]]$WHITE[\[\]\u@\h\[\]][\[\]\W$LIGHT_GREEN$(__git_ps1 " (%s)")\[\]]\[\]$ </code></pre>  <p>So something fishy is going on here, obviously. I'm using the regular terminal with an unedited Homebrew theme... Could someone tell me why this is happening? Is there something that could be resetting it every time I try to change it? If so, how do I find out what is doing that?</p>
