<p>I am trying to rename the "codesign" file name for patch problem, but I tired everything and seems like I can only have read access to the filea inside <code>usr/bin</code></p>  <p>1) Folder permission "System" is set to Read&amp;Write 2) I'm on admin account</p>  <p>What I have tried: Going into terminal using <code>sudo -i</code> to get root access to <code>usr/bin</code> for renaming. Typed in renaming command <code>mv codesign codesign_10.11</code> still get error of Operation can't be performed</p>  <p>What's wrong with my permission access? How can I fix it?</p>
