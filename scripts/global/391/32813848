<p>When giving a talk I usually use two screens: One is the wall showing the presentation to the audience, the other one is my Laptop screen with a mirror of the presentation, my speakernotes etc.  During the talks I pretty often do demos using a terminal. This requires that I turn around to check at the wall if everything works correctly. To avoid this I would like to have two terminal window, one on my laptop screen where I am typing and a mirror of it which is shown to the audience at the second screen. How can I do this? </p>
