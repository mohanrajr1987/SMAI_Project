<p>What causes the below error?</p>  <pre><code>-bash: ./proj.py: Permission denied </code></pre>  <p>I have one file, called <code>projsol.py</code>, that runs perfectly out of terminal when I enter <code>./projsol.py --summary *.html</code> in Terminal. </p>  <p>However, when I enter <code>./proj.py --summary *.html</code>, I get the above error. I've literally copied and pasted the entire context of <code>projsol.py</code> into <code>proj.py</code>, tried running the command again, and it still gives me the above bash error. What's causing this?</p>  <p>Note: I am <em>very</em> new to programming, and have very unfamiliar with Terminal and Python, so please explain in layman's terms (it's much appreciated!).</p>
