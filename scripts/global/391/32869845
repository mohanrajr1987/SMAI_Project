<p>Prove the link count is correct by listing all the directories that link to      it in a single ls(1) command. Your proof will show the inode numbers of      all linked directories being the same. This will require ls, some options,     and some globbing arguments.  Regular globbing arguments are all that is     required.</p>  <p>I tried using this</p>  <pre><code>ls -laiFR ../*q10 |grep 337 </code></pre>  <p>the links should be 9. it only displays 8 missing the link in the parent directory. Also I am not allowed to use grep. how can i do this? thanks</p>
