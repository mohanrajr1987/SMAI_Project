<p>I am attempting to cd into the filesystems directory as the title suggests. I was attempting to post an image but I do not yet have the reputation to do so. Am I missing a certain command? I am guessing you just cd into it but maybe I am wrong. I made a mistake when installing my Gentoo linux and am now attempting to chroot into the filesystem directory to add a password to my su. The commands I have entered where "cd /" and afterwards "cd proc" I used the "ls" command and can see filesystems in white. But when I try to cd into it, all that happens is it says the directory does not exist.</p>
