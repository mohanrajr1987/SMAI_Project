<p>Recently, I came across a function to put in <code>~/.bashrc</code></p>  <pre class="lang-sh prettyprint-override"><code>gpip(){    PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV="" pip "$@" } </code></pre>  <p>(<a href="http://hackercodex.com/guide/python-development-environment-on-mac-osx/" rel="nofollow">Source</a>)</p>  <p>I don't understand the use of <code>$@</code>. I guess that it sends to <code>pip</code> the argument passed to <code>gpip</code> from Terminal.</p>  <p>Is my understanding correct? What are those programming constructs called?</p>
