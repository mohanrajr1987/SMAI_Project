<p>I've been attempting to setup Xcode CI with my private cocoapods (I have 3, 2 private, 1 public).</p>  <p>I have a simple run script:</p>  <pre><code>export LANG=en_US.UTF-8 export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH" cd "$XCS_SOURCE_DIR/myproject"  if [ -e "Pods" ] then pod update --verbose else pod install --verbose fi </code></pre>  <p>and I made sure to update my project repository as well as the pod repos to have a remote of the style <code>git@github.com:username/repo.git</code>. </p>  <p>Every time I run an integration, I get the following error:</p>  <pre><code>Update all pods   Preparing  Cloning spec repo `myproject` from `https://github.com/busycm/CocoapodsPrivateSpecs.git`   $ /usr/local/bin/git clone https://github.com/busycm/CocoapodsPrivateSpecs.git myproject [!] Unable to add a source with url `https://github.com/busycm/CocoapodsPrivateSpecs.git` named `myproject`.
