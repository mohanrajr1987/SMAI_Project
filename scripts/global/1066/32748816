<p>In Jenkins, I have a job that I don't want to trigger a build for when the following commit message is found ::</p>  <pre><code>[REBASE] Rebasing with the integration commit that was just made in rev.123456789 </code></pre>  <p>The only thing that changes in the commit message is the number value at the end of the string.</p>  <p>To prevent the build, I'm using the "Excluded Commit Messages" field of the job configuration page. In that field, I placed the following REGEX ::</p>  <pre><code>/Rebasing with the integration commit that was just made in rev.\d+/ </code></pre>  <hr>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/WxvQ3.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/WxvQ3.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <hr>  <p>but the job is still triggering a build.  </p>  <p>Does anyone know if maybe my REGEX is bad, or if Jenkins requires some special syntax for REGEX's that I don't know about ?</p>  <p>Thanks,</p>  <p>Jeff</p>
