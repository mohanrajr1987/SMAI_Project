<p>Currently I create <code>rpm</code> for my app and install with <code>puppet</code>.  How would you go about using <code>docker</code>? Is there a best practice? What is the recommended way?</p>  <ol> <li>Continue creating rpm for your app and install in docker.</li> <li>Just use the docker file to do the scripting you need on your image creating <code>rpm</code> for your app is not needed anymore.</li> </ol>  <p>thanks</p>
