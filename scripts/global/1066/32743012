<p>I want to change build settings of a .xcodeproj without using Xcode IDE but through terminal commands (Codesigning Identity and Provisioning Profile to be exact).</p>  <p>I have searched all over but only found commands to build/archive the project from terminal, <strong>which I Do Not Want.</strong> What I want is to just change the settings, so that when I open the project in Xcode, it has the signing identities and provisioning profile set to what I had set in Terminal.</p>  <p>Xcodebuild command just builds/archives the project using what I pass as parameters, it doesn't set them as values in build settings of project.</p>  <p>Running <code>xcodebuild -target &lt;target-name&gt; -showBuildSettings</code> in terminal, where my project resides, gives me complete build settings of the project but I didn't get any method to set them. </p>  <p>Also I read <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27178452/set-xcode-build-setting-from-terminal">here</a> about using <code>-setObject</code>, but that also didn't help me as it also builds the code using parameters values I gave instead of actually setting them.</p>  <p>Currently using Xcode 6.3 and Xcode 7.</p>  <p>Any kind of help will be appreciated.</p>
