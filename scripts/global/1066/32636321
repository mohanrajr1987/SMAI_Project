<p>I've been using Dagger 2 recently and just did some work with scopes in my android project, adding scopes for Activities. While everything runs, builds and tests fine on my own machine. I'm getting a compile error on Jenkins CI. </p>  <pre><code>FAILURE: Build failed with an exception. * What went wrong: Execution failed for task ':Adverts:compile***DebugJava' .java.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.String cannot be cast to javax.lang.model.type.TypeMirror </code></pre>  <p>This is strange because the build has worked fine up until now with Dagger 2 just with less code being generated. When I navigate to the generated sources some, but not all of the code is generated. It looks like it's crapping it out somewhere along the way. Both CI and my machine are using the same version of JDK. </p>  <p>Has anybody ran into issues with CI &amp; Dagger 2 before?</p>
