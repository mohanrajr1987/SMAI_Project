<p>I am trying to use "${BUILD_LOG, maxLines, escapeHtml}" like discribed in: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16089096/how-can-i-take-last-20-lines-from-the-build-log-variable">How can I take last 20 lines from the $BUILD_LOG variable?</a></p>  <p>Unfortunately it doesn't work for me. </p>  <p>I get this error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Script1.groovy: 114: expecting anything but ''\n''; got it anyway @ line 114, column 301.      arted by user MYUSERNAME</p> </blockquote>  <p>My code in this line is:</p>  <pre><code>          msg.setText("This build (" + build.getFullDisplayName()            + " ) contains the following tasks:\n\nTASK\t\t\t  IMPLEMENTER:\n"            + taskList + "\n\n\nLink to this            build: ${BUILD_URL} \n ${BUILD_LOG, maxLines=9999, escapeHtml=false}" ); </code></pre>  <hr>  <p>If I take this out the following, it works. Thats why my guess is, that "<strong>BUILD_LOG</strong>" is not working anymore?</p>  <blockquote>   <p>${BUILD_LOG, maxLines=9999, escapeHtml=false}</p> </blockquote>  <hr>  <p>EDIT: Maybe as addition: I am trying to do this withing the PreSend groovy script. Since I am building the Email text dynamically. <code>${BUILD_URL}</code> works fine, <code>${BUILD_LOG, maxLines=9999, escapeHtml=false}</code> doesn't (for me) i am looking for a solution for this... the <code>msg</code> object is a java MimeMessage.</p>  <p>Thanks, Daniel</p>
