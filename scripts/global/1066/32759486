<p>our application maven version is <code>&lt;version&gt;my-version-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version&gt;</code>. We use the maven generated version number to identify builds in all communications (bug descriptions etc.). E.g. a bug was detected in <code>my-version-20150908.142611-17</code>.</p>  <p>However, we don't know how to easily link between these IDs and the Jenkins build IDs. The same version is called in Jenkins <code>#54</code>. </p>  <p>The lame workaround we found out is looking in the Jenkins console output, look for the line where it uploads into our nexus repository, and find out which maven build ID corresponds to <code>#54</code>... As for the other way around - which Jenkins ID corresponds to a maven build ID - we just take a guess based on timestamps :S </p>  <p>Any better ideas - technological or methodological?</p>
