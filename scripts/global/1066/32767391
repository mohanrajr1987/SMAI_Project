<p>I'm trying to implement Continuous integration for an ASP.NET website. I have an Azure Windows 2012 VM where the website should be hosted.</p>  <p>Right now the website has been deployed manually and works fine.</p>  <p>On my Visual Studio Online project, on the Build tab, I have 2 build steps - Visual Studio Build, and Windows Machine File Copy.</p>  <p>The Visual Studio Build works fine with no errors or warnings. The Windows Machine  File Copy fails. </p>  <p>Here are the settings:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/hTd3x.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/hTd3x.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>And here is the error:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/eH3xC.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/eH3xC.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Any help would be nice.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
