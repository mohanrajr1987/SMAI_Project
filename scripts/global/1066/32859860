<p>Did anyone managed to get <a href="https://magnum.travis-ci.com/" rel="nofollow">Travis CI</a> to deploy the app on iTunesConnect? I have read tons of articles and tried them without success.</p>  <p>My closest bet was this article:</p>  <p><a href="http://code.oursky.com/continuously-delivering-ios-builds-automated-with-travis-ci/" rel="nofollow">Continuously Delivering iOS Beta Builds Automated with Travis CI</a></p>  <p>They didn't provide info that you need to install <a href="http://www.makotemplates.org/" rel="nofollow">Mako</a> in order to work, so pay attention if you go this way.</p>  <p>The main problem however is the fact that I do not have Crittercism or HockeyApp accounts, however the python script want them from me and no matter if I do not provide them or provide fake it fails later as it actually tries to do something with them.</p>  <p>Other thing that I come across is:</p>  <p><a href="https://medium.com/ios-apprentice/automated-ios-app-beta-distribution-30855d77931a" rel="nofollow">Automated iOS beta distribution using Travis CI and Testflight</a></p>  <p>which is essentially written on top of <a href="https://gist.github.com/johanneswuerbach/5559514" rel="nofollow">Deploy an iOS app to testflight using Travis CI</a>. The problem here is that they deploy to TestFlight app instead of iTunesConnect.</p>  <p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
