<p>Sonar analysis is a nice way to check code compliance against a centrally defined policy. This is why I would like to use a profile with Blocker a Critical rules to signify a broken build.</p>  <p>I am using Jenkins do builds and invoke the SonarRunnerBuilder to get standard analysis on nightly builds of projects.</p>  <p>To achieve the features I outlined it would be best if I could run the analysis, check the results for violations (preferrably not sending them to Sonar server) and fail the build if there were any violations. So far I have not found way to do this using Google and looking through SonarRunner source code.</p>  <p>What I have considered is a workaround. I would implement a <a href="http://docs.sonarqube.org/display/DEV/Coding+a+Plugin#CodingaPlugin-Decorator" rel="nofollow" title="Decorator">Decorator</a> collecting violations and when the decoration reaches the project resource I would throw a RuntimeException to break the analysis. This would in turn fail the build.</p>  <p>would this work? Is there any better way to achieve this?</p>
