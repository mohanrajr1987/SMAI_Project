<p>I have a project on GitHub that is hooked with AppVeyor for continuous integration. AppVeyor is supposed to post status updates to pull requests, as in <a href="https://github.com/code-cracker/code-cracker/pull/513" rel="nofollow">this example</a>. However, it doesn't work for my project. AppVeyor builds are correctly triggered, but pull requests don't show the status indicators.</p>  <p>How can I make it work? Is there a specific way to set up the AppVeyor project?</p>
