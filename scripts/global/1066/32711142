<p>I recently ran across this Netflix Blog article <a href="http://techblog.netflix.com/2013/08/deploying-netflix-api.html" rel="nofollow">http://techblog.netflix.com/2013/08/deploying-netflix-api.html</a></p>  <p>They are talking about red/black deployment where they run the old and new code side by side and direct the production traffic to both of them. If something goes wrong they do a rollback.</p>  <p>How does the directing of the traffic work? and is it possible to adapt this strategy with e.g two Docker containers?</p>
