<p>I'm writing ansible playbook for one specific goal: i'd like to sync directory on server A-n, but before i should make git pull on server "B". I launch playbook on host A-n (described in inventory). I also have playbook for "git pull" on server B.  Is it possible to include one playbook in another? I don't know how, because ansible allow to specify only one host group in beginning of playbook.</p>
