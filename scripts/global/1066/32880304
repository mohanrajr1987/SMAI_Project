<p>I'm trying to setup Cocoapods with a CI bot via OS X server. I have the following pre-integration trigger:</p>  <pre><code>export LANG=en_US.UTF-8 export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH" cd "$XCS_SOURCE_DIR/myproject"  if [ -e "Pods" ] then pod update else pod install fi </code></pre>  <p>However some of the pods I have are in a private repo that I've been developing myself and in the output log of a bot integration run, I get:</p>  <pre><code>Update all pods Updating local specs repositories Cloning spec repo `my_organization` from `https://github.com/my_organization/CocoapodsPrivateSpecs.git` [!] Unable to add a source with url `https://github.com/my_organization/CocoapodsPrivateSpecs.git` named `my_organization`. You can try adding it manually in `~/.cocoapods/repos` or via `pod repo add`. </code></pre>  <p>I verified that there is in fact a private repo on my machine (I was able to push some versions to the github repo). What also confuses me is that the script is trying to add a repo named 'my_organization' but on my machine I named it something else (not sure if that matters).</p>
