<p>As mentioned in the title, I thinking about a dockerized jenkins. I have a running container that run all tests but now I want to run some deployment job.</p>  <p>The files (.py, .conf, .sh) will be copied into folders which are mounted by other container (app container). As I seen some recommend do not use docker as well. </p>  <p>Now I'm wondering if I should continue to use jenkins in a container (so i must find a way to run the deployment script) or prefer to install it on the server ? </p>
