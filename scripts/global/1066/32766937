<p>I have a big problem with quality of code when developers commit code to Github or Bitbucket. Sometimes, developers they can check and remove warning from their code. It's not good for product.  Currently, I'm using Jenkin server for auto build and check warning. However, Jenkin server just show number of warning only.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Vaa7D.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Vaa7D.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Now, I want to check who created a warnings on Jenkin server and then server will be sent message to their.</p>  <p>Could you help me to solve this problem. OR Give me some advice to solve it. </p>  <p>Thanks for your time to read my question. </p>
