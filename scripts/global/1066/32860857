<p><strong>Intro</strong> Hi, I'm developing rails application, which use <code>capybara</code>, <code>selenium-webdriver</code> and <code>rspec</code> for tests. </p>  <p><strong>Problem</strong> Now I have a functional tests, which runs in firefox (default selenium browser) and works with redirects to other hosts. For example, rspec before hook to get fresh google access token.</p>  <p>Locally on my laptop all tests runs with success:</p>  <p><code>bundle exec rspec </code></p>  <p>But codeship's builds fails.</p>  <p><strong>Questions</strong></p>  <p>Do I need to setup codeship to support "firefox" tests? If yes, how can I do it?</p>  <p>Does codeship supports redirects to other hosts? </p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
