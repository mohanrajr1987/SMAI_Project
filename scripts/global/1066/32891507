<p>BackstopJS generates a single page with regression test results. Is there any tool that works with CI (doesn't matter which one) and VCS (git) and assigns the test results to commits? I imagine the main page has a list of commits with passed/failed numbers next to them and links to a page with full results. Doesn't have to use BackstopJS.</p>  <p>Doesn't have to be as good as what I just described, I'd be happy for anything better than a script that copies results from BackstopJS to a folder with time and date.</p>
