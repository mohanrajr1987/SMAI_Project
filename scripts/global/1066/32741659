<p>I have installed the jenkins in my mac machine through Mac Installer, my current jenkins version is 1.628 when I opens Manage Jenkins page it shown as below screen shot. I would like to update the jenkins to newer version 1.630, so can any one please suggest me how to upgrade?, If I upgrade is there any issue to my existing jenkins configuration and jobs? .<a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/6gtan.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/6gtan.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
