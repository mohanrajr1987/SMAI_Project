<p>We are attempting to run our Selenium tests on TeamCity after build.</p>  <p>It appears as though the Selenium.WebDriver reference isn't downloaded by TeamCity. Here's the output of our build:</p>  <pre><code>SeleniumTests.cs(3, 7): error CS0246: The type or namespace name 'OpenQA' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)  SeleniumTests.cs(4, 7): error CS0246: The type or namespace name 'OpenQA' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)  SeleniumTests.cs(11, 9): error CS0246: The type or namespace name 'PhantomJSDriver' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)  </code></pre>  <p>Each of these references are inside the Selenium.WebDriver package.</p>  <p>All of the other NuGet references: NUnit.Runners and NUnit are resolved by TeamCity perfectly fine (NuGet package restore appears to be working).</p>  <p>NuGet will automatically resolve the packages and run the tests fine on my local computer.</p>  <p>I tried removing the Selenium.WebDriver NuGet package from the project. This causes the <strong>exact same error</strong>, so it appears as though the package is never downloaded.</p>  <p>Does anyone have any suggestions?</p>  <p><strong>Update:</strong> the Seleinum WebDriver package has 2 files: a dll and an xml. TeamCity was downloading the xml but not the dll. I manually copied the dll from my computer into the packages folder on the TeamCity server and our tests ran. I'll leave this open for anyone to answer why only some of the files were downloaded with NuGet.</p>
