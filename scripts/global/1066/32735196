<p>I have an web application in first git repository, and some client designs for it in second git repository. Every client design pushed in it's own branch. Both repos attached to build configuration, and I want to select which branch of second repo must be checkouted, when I run build on some branch of first repo.</p>  <p>Now, always default branch of second repo checkouted (how described <a href="https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD9/Working+with+Feature+Branches" rel="nofollow">here</a>). On <a href="https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD9/Predefined+Build+Parameters#PredefinedBuildParameters-Branch-RelatedParameters" rel="nofollow">this</a> page I found that exists parameter <code>teamcity.build.vcs.branch.&lt;VCS root ID&gt;</code>, but it is for reading, not for setting up before build.</p>  <p>How to do this build? Or may be other better way to do this?</p>
