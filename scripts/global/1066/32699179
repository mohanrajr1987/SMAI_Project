<p>I had a bot that was working perfectly under Xcode 6.4. An after trigger script was automatically uploading the IPA using this path : "$XCS_OUTPUT_DIR/$XCS_PRODUCT" </p>  <p>However (even after redoing a bot from scratch) it appears that :</p>  <ul> <li>$XCS_PRODUCT is Always empty.</li> <li>$XCS_OUTPUT_DIR is pointing to a folder that does not exist because after checking out on server it appears that Xcode server is storing .ipa there : /Library/Developer/XcodeServer/IntegrationAssets/</li> </ul>  <p>How to find my .ipa without this variable during my after trigger script?</p>
