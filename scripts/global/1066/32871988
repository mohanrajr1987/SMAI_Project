<p>I have a build configured on visual studio online that was working great until I set the following msbuild arguments:</p>  <pre><code>/p:DeployOnBuild=true /p:WebPublishMethod=Package /p:PackageAsSingleFile=true /p:SkipInvalidConfigurations=true /p:PackageLocation="$(build.stagingDirectory)" </code></pre>  <p>The error I get is:     "C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\Microsoft\VisualStudio\v14.0\Web\Microsoft.Web.Publishing.targets (2205, 5) Copying file Views\Web.config to obj\Stage\CSAutoParameterize\original\Views\Web.config failed. Could not find a part of the path 'Views\Web.config'.</p>  <p>I noticed on the build logs, that this file was not included in the "Get sources" stage. Have no idea, why the error appears only when publish parameters are set.</p>  <p>Any Ideas?</p>  <p>PS: I am using this arguments to prepare the project for continuous deployment.</p>
