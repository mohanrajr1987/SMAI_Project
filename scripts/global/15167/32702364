<p>When we map a class using Fluent NHibernate we do it like this:</p>  <pre><code>public class TypeMapping: ClassMap&lt;Type&gt; {     public TypeMapping()     {         Id(t =&gt; t.Id).GeneratedBy.Identity();         Map(t =&gt; t.Name);     } } </code></pre>  <p>This code is ok to me. However, I was wondering: if the purpose of the mapping methods is just to map a property to a column, why does it receive a lambda as parameter? Why not just an <code>object</code>? </p>  <p>I mean, is it a lambda for some special reason inside the method or this could be useful to me somehow?</p>  <p>Thank you :)</p>
