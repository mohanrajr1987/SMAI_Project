<p>I've had to support a project using Fluent NHibernate for a few years now and I'm honestly tired of it. I want to use Dapper-dot-net (<a href="https://github.com/StackExchange/dapper-dot-net" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/StackExchange/dapper-dot-net</a>) going forward but some of my team is against using it due to the concerns of mixing two ORM frameworks into one project. </p>  <p>Are their concerns justified? Does anyone have experience in this area that could list why NHibernate and Dapper (or other ORM Frameworks) cannot exist together on the same project?</p>  <p>Thanks,</p>
