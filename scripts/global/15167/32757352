<p>I have 2 users in my mysql database. (root/myUser)</p>  <p>"myUser" only have access to "myDatabase" database. i added some mapping to FluentNHibernate in a C# application and tried to access the DB with the user "MyUser".</p>  <p>i get this exception:</p>  <pre><code>{"SELECT command denied to user 'myUser'@'localhost' for table 'session_variables'"} </code></pre>  <p>that table is in performance_schema database. the database itself have info about my other usernames and stuff.</p>  <p>Is there anyway i can fix this without giving access to the whole database?</p>  <p>Also, Keep in mind that the same application works with root user.</p>  <p>/* SOLUTION */</p>  <p>I forgot that you can give access to a specific table in a database, you can fix this by giving SELECT privilege to "performance_schema.session_variables" and "performance_schema.session_status"</p>
