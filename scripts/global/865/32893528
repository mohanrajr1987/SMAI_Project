<p>I have looked everywhere for help and nothing is hitting the nail on the head of what I am trying to do.</p>  <p>I have a grade averaging program that I want to add a guy to with netbeans and I am not sure how to put the two together. I can somewhat make a guy with the help of netbeans but I am totally lost in how to bring them together.</p>  <p>Any help or advise would be appreciated as I am still learning.</p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
