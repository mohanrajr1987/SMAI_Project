<p>I'm creating a Excel VSTO using c#. My operation is easy, just right-click on the cell and click on "Update" and a winform that shows progress status will prompt out and launch the controls on the form is tied to a User Process Controller.</p>  <p>The problem is now that the process has launched and executed before the form is fully load, is there a way that I can block the user process controller from executing before all the control on the progress status form is fully shown and loaded? The image below depict my condition.</p>  <p>I have tried to put my User Process Controller call in Form Activated, Shown, Loaded, and nothing works.</p>  <p>This is the first stage the form loaded. Note : The two line of text has shown that the user control process has been executed. <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/yM60r.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/yM60r.png" alt="Form stage 1"></a></p>  <p>This is the second stage the form loaded. <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/lN8VX.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/lN8VX.png" alt="Form stage 2"></a></p>  <p>This is third stage <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/1Sgzu.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/1Sgzu.png" alt="Form stage 3"></a></p>  <p>And finally it is fully loaded. <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/q3Usc.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/q3Usc.png" alt="Finally Loaded"></a></p>
