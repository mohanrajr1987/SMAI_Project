<p>I have two java projects. Both with runnable GUIs. </p>  <p>I would like to add a button in Project1 that when pressed opens Project2 application window and closes Project 1. </p>  <p>Since I am using MVC for both applications it would become too cluttered to just copy paste all the code from the first project into the other one, which is why I am looking for an easier alternative.</p>  <p>I have built a path between the two projects, but I can't seem to find a way to start the second application on a button press. </p>
