<p>Is there a way to display a simple text based UI via shell scripting that isn't interspersed with the prompts &amp; etc in the main bash process? Essentially I want something that acts like <code>man</code>, only it displays something that isn't a manpage and waits for a user input to get back to whatever the bash process was displaying. Is there a way to do this just using an existing shell command or should I be doing this portion with a compiled language?</p>  <p>I know how I can get the user input and print stuff, but I'm unsure how to display said separate ui like <code>man</code> is doing.</p>
