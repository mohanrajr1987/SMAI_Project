<p>I am attempting to keep my pivot headers from cycling like a carousel but can't seem to find the right property or setting to do so. Is it possible to disable?</p>  <p>Basically stop this from happening:</p>  <p>State One:</p>  <pre><code>| One | Two | Three | Four | </code></pre>  <p>State Two - After Left Swipe:</p>  <pre><code>| Two | Three | Four | One | </code></pre>  <p>I don't mind the text highlight changing as it moves down etc, I just don't want my pivot items shifting position. I know I can solve this using additional controls and disabling the headers altogether, but I was hoping there is a built in solution.</p>
