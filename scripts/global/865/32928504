<p>This is a bit of a (potentially) multi-part part question. My goal is to either be able to reset UI changes that users make, limit changes that users can make, in order to have a consistent environment in a multi-session lab situation.</p>  <p>I have played with some registry settings that allow me to set background (which I want to be a solid color) and such, but the changes don't get "applied" till after a restart. Thus far I have found do way to "Refresh" the UI. And, ideally I could do this without a restart. In addition, if someone where to set a Theme, then my simple registry hacks are overridden and even after a restart they don't make a difference, so I would like to just disable the ability to set Themes. Now, I found <a href="http://www.askvg.com/all-kinds-of-restrictions-for-windows-2000-xp-2003-and-vista/" rel="nofollow">this</a>, but it's all pre Vista references, and I am unable to make changes to the Policy key in HKCU. So, my questions are: 1: Is there a way to limit certain changes to the UI programmatically? And... 2: Is there a way to "Refresh" programmatically after resetting those changes I do allow?</p>  <p>For what it is worth, I am testing this with Windows 7 Home, but I would like to find a solution that would work in Windows 7 Pro up to various versions of Windows 10.</p>  <p>Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>
