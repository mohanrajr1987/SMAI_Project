<p>I have an application written in C++/QT5 with a QListView widget within a QHBoxLayout within a QGroupBox. There is also a QTabWidget in the main window. I would like the user to be able to resize the QListView widget by clicking and dragging and for the other items to automatically resize themselves accordingly.</p>  <p>I feel like this should be something that is easily done within the framework of QT5, but I can't for the life of me find a way. Even having a border on the list view that I can resize within the code of my application would be a start.</p>
