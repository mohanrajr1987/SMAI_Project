<p>We have one requirement in which <code>$state.go()</code> opens an HTML page with a dynamic table. Once this <code>$state.go</code> creates/loads the <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> tag then I have to set the values in the cells of this table. But as <code>$state.go</code> uses promise in back-end. So when the method calling this <code>$state.go</code> is called doesn't set the values for the first time. But start it from the next time.</p>  <p>The scenario is:</p>  <pre><code>$scope.myfunction:function() {   $state.go('xyz');   setValues() //should be called once the previous line is completed } </code></pre>  <p>I have tried:</p>  <pre><code>$rootscope.$on $stateChangeSuccess event //it is not triggered and there is no value inside toState $state.go().then //which makes my code execute from the second time. </code></pre>  <p>and lot more things.</p>  <p>Please help me out.</p>
