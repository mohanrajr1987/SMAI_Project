<p>My problem is that I want to create a background application but with a user interface that could be restored and minimized to the system tray and it starts with windows. I tried searching how to start but I only found threads about Windows Service without UI or creating form and hiding it. So my question is how should I start ? A Windows Form ? A Service and add an interface somehow ?</p>  <p>Thank you!</p>
