<p>I have a python program which takes as input about 20 different input values where some inputs are dependent on each other. For example, if my first input was fruit, then my next inputs could ONLY be apple, orange, banana. And, if my first input was 'vegetable' my next inputs could ONLY be spinach, broccoli , etc.. </p>  <p>I've started looking into widgets to make buttons, drop down menus, etc., but it seems like there should already be a GUI framework developed from something like this. Does anyone know where I should start looking? I have little experience with making GUIs for large programs. </p>
