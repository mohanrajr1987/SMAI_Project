<p>Forgive my English and beginners mistakes. </p>  <p>I am going to make a GUI with WPF because then I can use MahApps.Metro, which makes my application pretty. This application will be installed on computers and should be available 24/7.So I thought using a windows server would be a good idea.</p>  <p>But some say that it is a bad idea. What should i use instead? I really want to make this application 24/7 available.</p>  <p>Please help, thank you!! :)</p>
