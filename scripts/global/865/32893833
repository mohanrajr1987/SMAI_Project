<p>I wrote a program in python that uses XlsxWriter to create workbooks and worksheets. If I run my program in my IDE, an excel workbook is created inside the folder that contains my entire project and all the files. </p>  <p>I am in the process of making a GUI, but I was wondering if anybody here knew where the workbook would popup and how I could make a GO button on the GUI pop up a new window when other people use my program. I am using tkinter for my GUI. </p>  <p>Basically, does anyone know how to write a function that "runs" the program, and where would my workbook popup (assuming that we sent this program to someone else) if that person pressed GO? Would it pop up in their desktop? etc. </p>
