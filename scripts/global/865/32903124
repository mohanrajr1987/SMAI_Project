<p>There exists a black line which rests on top of all tabbars and you seemingly have three options, remove it, customize it, or keep it. </p>  <p>I already know how to remove it, and for those who are looking at this to find out how to do so the code in Swift is</p>  <p>(put in app delegate)</p>  <pre><code>    let tabbar = UITabBar.appearance()     tabbar.shadowImage = UIImage()     tabbar.translucent = false     tabbar.backgroundImage = UIImage() </code></pre>  <p>But anyway, I'm curious about the second option, customizing it. I've seen some apps color it and make it a part of their overall theme. I'm curious as to how one can achieve this. </p>
