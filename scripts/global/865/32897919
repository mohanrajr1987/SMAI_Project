<p>Say you've a list of Strings. The number of Strings varies. Is there a way to randomly display these strings like in an Apple presentation when they show a bunch of features in a slide. See link for an example.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.technobuffalo.com/2011/06/10/iphone-5-feature-hinted-at-in-ios-5-wwdc-presentation/" rel="nofollow">http://www.technobuffalo.com/2011/06/10/iphone-5-feature-hinted-at-in-ios-5-wwdc-presentation/</a></p>  <p>So, text is randomly scattered but never overlaps. Spacing is pretty even. Some text is dim, some is bolder, big, small, etc. I couldn't find the 'name' of this effect (or these multiple combined effects) if there even is one?</p>  <p>I assume they do it manually in a slide of course, but I was wondering if there was a known way of doing this programmatically.</p>  <p>Any help would be much appreciated!</p>
