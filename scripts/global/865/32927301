<p>In Android native app development, you can define different <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/components/fragments.html" rel="nofollow">Fragments</a>, which are parts of your UI that you can show depending on view size (like a menu besides a detail view on larger screens, but only the menu, and then later only the detail view after selecting something, on small screens). The implementation is the same, so the code does not actually know whether the menu and detail view are shown at the same time or one after another.</p>  <p>Is there anything like this for Javascript frontend development? I would have thought that react.js had some way to deal with this, but searching the web and asking on IRC have not turned up any way to achieve this.</p>  <p>Thanks for any ideas, hints, best practices or experiences with this.</p>
