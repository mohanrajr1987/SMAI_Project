<p>I have the following code in my .htaccess to remove the file extensions from my webpages. I like this because to me a website's URL looks cleaner.</p>  <pre><code>RewriteEngine On RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteRule ^([^\.]+)$ $1.php [NC,L] </code></pre>  <p>I'm having one issue with this though. I have a phpbb board sat in a folder in the root directory and i'd like to access the board in it's current position but i can't seem to access it properly.</p>  <p>So if i look at my root folder, it looks a little like this.</p>  <pre><code>forum                   (folder) .htaccess page1.php page2.php page3.php </code></pre>  <p>In the menu for my website, i link to the pages like this.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;a href="forum/"&gt;Forum&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="page1"&gt;Page 1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="page2"&gt;Page 2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="page3"&gt;Page 3&lt;/a&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Trying to access the forum i get a 404 error, where the browser thinks that i'm looking to access www.myDomain.com/forum/.php. Obviously, this is wrong.</p>  <p>If i attempt to access the forum via www.myDomain.com/forum/ i also get a 404 error, where the browser also thinks that i'm trying to access www.myDomain.com/forum/.php. Obviously, this is wrong too.</p>  <p>I want both instances to go to www.myDomain.com/forum/index.php without explicitly stating index.php.</p>  <p>I've tried changing the .htaccess within the forum folder where a 404 error gets redirected to the index.php but this causes issues when logging in to the phpbb board for some reason.</p>  <p>If i don't have the Rewrite in it's current form in the .htaccess, then it all works perfectly but i then have to use the file extensions. The menu works using the links as shown and www.myDomain.com/forum/ finds the index.php.</p>  <p>What's the solution to this please? I'm sure there is one because stalkoverflow.com does a similar thing.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
