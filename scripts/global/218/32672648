<p>I am trying to build a simple Apple TV app (using the new tvOS SDK) and wanted to test out accessing and playing local media files from my NAS drive. </p>  <p>After a lot of googling, I can't find any solid info on how to do a simple listing of available NAS drives on the current network.</p>  <p>Is there any suggested libraries/frameworks/sdks out there that can easily show all network drives on the currently connected network in iOS?</p>
