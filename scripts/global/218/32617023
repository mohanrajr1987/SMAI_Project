<p>I'm writing a bat file and would like to add a move function. The idea is that I have a .txt file with on each line a relative path\file. </p>  <p>So for instance - and this is just a random example:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Data\English\caust00.tga</p>      <p>Data\English\Specific\caust01.tga</p>      <p>Data\caust00.tga</p>      <p>Data\caust00</p> </blockquote>  <p>At the moment I only have a delete function, which is simple because it doesn't require an additional set with variables. (Obviously, there are more files inside the "Data" otherwise I'd just move the entire folder).</p>  <p>Say the 4 lines above are saved in Test.txt, it would only be this line:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>for /F "tokens=*" %%A in (Test.txt) do del "%%A" </p> </blockquote>  <p>to delete all 4 files. Now this is nice, but I want to implement a move function: i.e. that it creates a new folder, say "Temp1" with inside it - this depends on the content of "Test.txt":</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Data\English\caust00.tga</p>      <p>Data\English\Specific\caust01.tga</p>      <p>Data\caust00.tga</p>      <p>Data\caust00</p> </blockquote>  <p>I hope you didn't get lost already. I'd love to receive some advice, because I'm pretty much clueless how to go about it.      </p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong>: So, I have a folder called "Data" with a lot of subfolders and files inside it. I also have a text file with this content:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Data\Movie\caust00.tga</p>      <p>Data\Movie\caust01.tga</p>      <p>Data\caust02.tga</p>      <p>Data\caust03.tga</p>      <p>Data\WaterPlane\SCCSpyDrone.ani</p>      <p>Data\WaterPlane\SCCStop.ani</p>      <p>Data\WaterPlane\SCCTimedChg.ani</p> </blockquote>  <p>Now I want to implement a move function that moves these files to a new folder "Test" so that we get this:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Test\Data\Movie\caust00.tga</p>      <p>Test\Data\Movie\caust01.tga</p>      <p>Test\Data\caust02.tga</p>      <p>Test\Data\caust03.tga</p>      <p>Test\Data\WaterPlane\SCCSpyDrone.ani</p>      <p>Test\Data\WaterPlane\SCCStop.ani</p>      <p>Test\Data\WaterPlane\SCCTimedChg.ani</p> </blockquote>
