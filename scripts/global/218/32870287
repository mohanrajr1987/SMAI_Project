<p>I am trying to compile to a binaries directory... everything works if I compile to the root directly. At first, I attempted to let gcc handle it by passing bin/ under the -o flag. Make appears (infuriatingly) to just remove the path from the target and compile to the root anyway...</p>  <p>Then I tried letting make itself handle it, however it now fails to find the rule to compile anything.</p>  <p>The other thing I tried is adding:</p>  <pre><code>$(OBJECTS): </code></pre>  <p>to the first rule, but then make just calls gcc by itself with no arguments.</p>  <p>This is the version where I let make handle the paths:</p>  <pre><code>CC = gcc DIR = bin TARGETS = cloud controller OBJECTS = $(addprefix $(DIR)/, $(TARGETS))  all: $(OBJECTS)  $(DIR)/%: $@.c         $(CC) $&lt; -o $@  $(DIR):         mkdir $(DIR) </code></pre>  <p>This is the version where I let gcc handle the paths:</p>  <pre><code>CC = gcc DIR = bin TARGETS = cloud controller  all: $(TARGETS)     mkdir $(DIR) -p  %: $@.c         $(CC) $&lt; -o $(DIR)/$@ </code></pre>
