<p>I want to get the latest libre office from their ftp using wget. However, I can not figure out in the BIG documentation where they mention you can select the latest updated directory.</p>  <p>This is the ftp I want to access:   </p>  <pre><code> http://ftp.nluug.nl/office/libreoffice/libreoffice/stable/5.0.1/win/x86_64/ </code></pre>  <p>However, after libreoffice/stable I don't want to specify this type but I want wget to automatically select the latest updated directory. Does anyone know how to do that?</p>  <p>I thought, maybe I could do this: </p>  <pre><code>http://ftp.nluug.nl/office/libreoffice/libreoffice/stable/*/win/x86_64/ </code></pre>  <p>But that would make no sense. I tried finding it on stackoverflow, google and wget documentation, but I haven't found it. I appreciate it if you help me!</p>  <p>If you have any questions, just comment :)</p>  <p><strong>INFO</strong>: I download it using a batch file</p>
