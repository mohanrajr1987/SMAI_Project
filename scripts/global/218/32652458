<p>I want to be able to create 2 or more tar.gz (or other) archives that will have some overlapping directories, but not overlapping files.  I would like to extract my 2 or more archives into the same working area and have the contents of overlapping directories overlaid or merged, rather than have a situation where I get 'Folder' and 'Folder (2)'</p>  <p>More detailed example:</p>  <p><strong>arch_1.tar.gz</strong> contains the following</p>  <pre><code>Project    Documentation        README_1.md    Code        app_xyz.c        server_xyz.c </code></pre>  <p>And <strong>arch_2.tar.gz</strong> contains this</p>  <pre><code>Project    Documentation       README_2.md    Code       app_abc.c       server_abc.c </code></pre>  <p>Now I want to be able to extract the 2 example tar.gz archives from above and end up with this:</p>  <pre><code>Project    Documentation       README_1.md       README_2.md    Code       app_abc.c       app_xyz.c       server_abc.c       server_xyz.c </code></pre>  <p>But right now, when I test this, I get this (not desirable):</p>  <pre><code>Project    Documentation       README_1.md    Code       app_xyz.c       server_xyz.c Project (2)    Documentation       README_2.md    Code       app_abc.c       server_abc.c </code></pre>  <p>Someone at work described this to me a while ago and it sounded great, but I haven't been able to implement it.  Maybe it's just a matter of different options on the command line when I go do the extract.</p>  <p>In case it matters, I am using Windows 7 on 1 machine that will be creating the tar.gz files but the extraction will likely occur in Mint Linux (all other dev machines).</p>
