<p>Is there any way in Linux(SUSE) to log the items below when one file or directory is accessed?</p>  <p>e.g.,<br></p>  <pre><code>File_Name/Directory_Name  Date_Time             who       Access_Permission FileA                     09/24/2015_08:12:17   UserA[all users]     Execute   </code></pre>  <p>At 09/24/2015_08:12:17, FileA was accessed by UserA(permission group: all users) who execute the file.    </p>
