<p><code>string[] directory = Directory.GetDirectories(path, Criteria)</code> </p>  <p>Using the above and <code>System.Diagnostics.Process.Start(directory)</code> I can open up multiple directory that meet certain Criteria - the criteria being the name of the folder in a directory.</p>  <p>How do I take the output of the <code>System.Diagnostics.Process.Start(directory)</code> and convert to a string, rather than open the directory?</p>  <p>All the subfolders within the directories that would open, have the same folder structure, so I would like to navigate to specific subfolders within these directories; the only way I can think of doing that, is by redirecting the <code>System.Diagnostics.Process.Start(directory)</code> output to a string, and adding the rest of folder path such as <code>@'\Photos'</code> to the output string and then using <code>System.Diagnostics.Process.Start(newPath);</code> on this new folder path.</p>  <p>If anyone has a better way of doing it I'm all ears. My full code is below:</p>  <pre><code>string path = @"C:\Projects\"; string criteria = "*" + textBox1.Text + "*";  string[] dir = Directory.GetDirectories(path, criteria); foreach (string directory in dir)       {           System.Diagnostics.Process.Start(directory);       } </code></pre>
