<p>First time using Stack, sorry if I am doing something wrong!</p>  <p>I have a WAMP server on my home machine. I created Alias directories pointing to directories outside my server root. They are working fine and are accessible from my site and behave like child directories.</p>  <p>But when I try to use php to access these directories (such as to use glob to list only specific filetypes from inside these alias directories) php functions don't recognize them as directories inside the root so I can't figure out what path to give to the php functions.</p>  <p>Any suggestions on how to use php with directories outside of the server root? Maybe Alias directories are not the way to go?</p>
