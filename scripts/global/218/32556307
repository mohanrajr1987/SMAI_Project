<p>I'm trying to compile and run two files that are nested in a directory on a server I'm connected to via ssh. The files are named Driver.java and Life.java, so I need both to compile, and I need to run Driver.java.<br> I don't really understand why we need to use the sbt in the first place, so if you could help me understand that as well, that would be awesome. Anyways, here's what the directory looks like:  </p>  <p>/home/ugrads/name/Projects/name-location/name-p1  </p>  <p>In this directory are all the files for this project, being:<br> - build.sbt<br> - project (a directory)<br> - README.md<br> - sbt<br> - sbt-launch.jar<br> - seeds (a directory)<br> - src (where Life.java and Driver.java are)<br> - target (a directory)  </p>  <p>Thanks in advance for the help  </p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong>: My teacher, in the Github repo, says we need to type '$ ./sbt compile' to compile it, and '$ ./sbt "run Driver seeds/seedFile"' to run the file, but the first one doesn't work to compile it (or I don't know what to type and what directory to be in when I type it) so I can't run it to test it... </p>
