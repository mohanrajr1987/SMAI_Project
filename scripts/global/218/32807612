<p>What i want is for the user to be able to set a directory for where they'd like the files to be downloaded, Then they press a download button and the HTML will get the files and automatically download it to the designated location. All of this is going to be inside my C# form that uses Awesomium 1.7.0. "What i need is in HTML tho"</p>  <p>Optional: Also saving of the location so when they revisit the page it's still there</p>
