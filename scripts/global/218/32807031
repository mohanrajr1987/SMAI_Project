<p>As title.</p>  <p>I want to monitor a directory that files in the directory being opened can be detected. But I just found that watching a directory for changes.</p>  <p>I have used the WatchService, but ENTRY_MODIFY event was not triggered when I just opened the file.</p>  <p>Detecting the specific file being opened is easy. This issue is how to detect Unspecified files in the directory.</p>  <p>Is there a method to do this?</p>
