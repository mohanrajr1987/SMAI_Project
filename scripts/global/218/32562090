<p>I'm using anaconda for managing python packages and don't seem to able to activate an environment that is located in a custom folder even though anaconda is perfectly aware of the folder and the environments' existence. </p>  <p>using "conda info --envs" in windows command prompt does show the env and its location but using  "activate envname" returns</p>  <p>"No environment named 'envname' exists in C:\PGM\Anaconda\envs"</p>  <p>with C:\PGM\Anaconda being the root installation of anaconda (company policy, can't change that).</p>  <p>How do I point to this other location for env activation?  I already tried:</p>  <p>adding the location to the windows PATH variable (permanently). Temporarily adding the location to the windows PATH vars (in cmd). And adding it in front of the envname like so: "activate C:\Users...\envname" but it returns the same message. </p>  <p>I looked into this post: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20081338/how-to-activate-an-anaconda-environment">How to activate an Anaconda environment</a></p>  <p>but its not working for me. My conda installation actually shows 3 envs directories when I issue the command "conda info" so it knows the directory as a envs candidate but it looks in just one for some reason even though it does find it when issuing "conda info --envs".</p>  <p>thanks in advance</p>
