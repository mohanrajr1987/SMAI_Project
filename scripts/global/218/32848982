<p>** I want to do this for educational cause only, for myself, not to replace any system that is already implemented in the Windows OS **</p>  <p>I want to implement some kind of directory locker in Windows 10. In order to do so, I want my program to run in the background, and every time it will identify a try to access a directory, it will search whether the directory is locked or not, and if it is locked, it will pump up a password insertion box.</p>  <p>I want to start by pumping up the password message box (first stage), and after that to actually block the access if the password is wrong (second stage).</p>  <p>Any leads?</p>
