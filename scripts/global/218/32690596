<p>Since I updated to Xcode 7 and iOS 9 there have been a few warnings I havent seen before. In particular, "Tests not found for option...", the full warning can be seen below:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/tZqkt.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/tZqkt.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Any idea what the solution would be? It seems odd that its effecting the projectNameTests.</p>
