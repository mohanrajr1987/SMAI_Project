<p>Im trying to find out how I can mark things in ListViews with a longClick. After I selected one item ,the Actionbar should change with diffrent options (buttons like delete, add , copy etc) which Im able to execute.I really didnt know how I can find these examples because Its a kind unique I guess. I founded threads where I can Mark an Item which gets a diffrent color and nothing else. How can I achieve this ?</p>  <p><strong>Before selecting :</strong> <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/NJdfU.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/NJdfU.png" alt="Before selecting"></a></p>  <p><strong>After long click :</strong> <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/TBCjL.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/TBCjL.png" alt="After a long Click on a Item"></a></p>
