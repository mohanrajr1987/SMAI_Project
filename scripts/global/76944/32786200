<p>guys! I write a simple notepad and have a little question to you. I need to hide actionbar when I click on EditText form. For example, I want to write some text, click on EditText form, then I get a keyboard. After getting keyboard I need to hide action Bar. If you use iA Writer for android you know what I talking about.</p>  <p>Thank you in advance!</p>
