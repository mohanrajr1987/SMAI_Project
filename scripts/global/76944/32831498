<p>I'm trying to make the action bar app icon (top left image) clickable but it just doesn't work, I've already searched for some answers but nothing works. I've already tried to <code>getSupportActionBar().setHomeButtonEnabled(true);</code> and I can see the icon, but i still can't click on it. I know I can handle the event in the method <code>onOptionsItemSelected(MenuItem item)</code> but the event will never get triggered with my situation. I also don't get why I have to use <code>getSupportActionBar();</code> instead of <code>getActionBar()</code>...the second one is always null. The minimum sdk is 16 and the maximum is 22. I read this answer -> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8028197/actionbarcompat-app-icon-action-click-not-working-on-4-0-devices">ActionBarCompat - App icon action (click) not working on 4.0 devices</a> but I don't know how to get in the ActionBarHelperICS.java class or if it apply to my case.</p>
