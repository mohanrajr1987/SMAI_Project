<p>I imported this project from eclipse, it was working fine there Due to <code>multidex</code> I supposed to migrate, after I migrated to Android studio I had suffered many problems I fixed all but now because of this line:</p>  <pre><code>getActionBar().setBackgroundDrawable(new ColorDrawable(Color.rgb(103, 58, 183)));  </code></pre>  <p>It shows <code>NullPointerException</code> for pre lollipop devices kindly help me to come out of this.</p>
