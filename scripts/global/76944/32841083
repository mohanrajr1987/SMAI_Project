<p>Hi I want to build my android app with 2 tabs using viewpager.The tabs myst have tha same image/gradient as background.I do not want to set the background to each tab separately but once to both tabs. My app would be like this image[![I can not set separately the image because the image are like gradient. Here is a link with how the app will look like. <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13742394/slice.png" rel="nofollow">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13742394/slice.png</a> As you can see I am using the same image and to the actionbar so it has to be the same.</p>
