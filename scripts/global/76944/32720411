<p>I'm working with <code>ActionBar</code> in Eclipse. While creating project I took minsdk 11, target sdk 21 when the project created I have seen that it's extending the <code>ActionBarActivity</code> (with error msg: <code>This type is deprecated</code>)</p>  <p>Then I added the <code>appcompat_v7</code> to the current project and  ActionBarActivity as AppCompatActivity, cleaning also done, but the graphical layout is not loading showing the errors like:</p>  <pre><code>Failed to find the style corresponding to the id 2130772027 Failed to find the style corresponding to the id 2130771996 </code></pre>  <p>Case 1 : Regardless of the error in graphical layout I try to launch the          project on Emulator then Launcher icon is missing </p>  <p>Case 2 : Then I changed API 23 to API 21           and launched it on Emulator then  ActionBar is missing</p>
