<p>I got a task to make a small website without a server side (back end)(static information website).</p>  <p>The only request is that the text inside the pages need to be easly adjustable without diving in the code itself.</p>  <p>What technology is recommended for the implementation of this (small) "module"? I have knowledge of basic html, css and js, spring and Angularjs.</p>
