<p>I want to make a website where user can enter phrases in one language and they will be translated to English. The phrases they enter don't have to be the exact same as the one on the website, but as long as certain words match, the website will show results. I guess I can enter phrases and translate them manually, but I feel like there should be other way to translate phrases. However I'm not sure how to even begin to find a solution. I've never really done a project like this. All I've learned is python, javascript, html, css, and things I code are programs that are more interview style. Any suggestions for my project, or where to learn to make useful things in general, are highly appreciated!</p>
