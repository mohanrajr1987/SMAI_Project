<p>If the title is not correct I am sorry. Basicly what I'm trying to do is link on posts. I have a for-loop where I load all the posts so it looks like</p>  <pre><code>Post1 posted by: person  Post2 posted by: person2 </code></pre>  <p>All data are stored in db where there are separate for Heading and person. I want to do that when someone clicks the persons name it will redirect them to the link of their profile (also sending their name in session). But when I load the list I am trying to get name using $i, but it takes only the last one.</p>  <p>If you got what I talked about I will be pleased if you could help me. Thanks</p>
