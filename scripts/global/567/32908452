<p>Please follow this link: <a href="http://www.blendtrix.com/support/manual/1-Tab-1/8-Articol-1---Tab-1" rel="nofollow">click</a></p>  <p>The problem is that jQuery is blocked by something or is just not loading. For example, when pressing the "click here if this was helpful" button or when typing something in the search bar, nothing happens. I've done some research and something which can block jQuery is "js/universal/custom.js" which is loaded, but either if it still loads or not, jQuery still doesn't work for those elements.</p>  <p>I don't understand why. Waiting  for your answers! :D</p>
