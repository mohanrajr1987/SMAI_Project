<p>I would like to make a website for my math club in my school.</p>  <p>So, basically, the website is about giving questions on math and i want to have multiple choices questions. Once the user select the answer and submit, it will display whether user gets the right answer.</p>  <p>My question is that is there any website template helping me build this website? Should I use some website content management system, like wordpress, phpBB?</p>
