<p>Im into learning swift2 using Xcode 7 and I want to even create an iOS app for my classifieds ads website! I am not a good programmer but I do believe that I can make it by myself if only someone can give me tips on which way to connect Data from the site into the app! Should i have separated database or I can relay on the contents on my website to be transferred to the app! If there any way to do that please let me know! I apprecaite  it !</p>
