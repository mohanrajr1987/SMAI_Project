<p>I would like to write a program or script that will go through a website and download all MP3's. So for example, I would go to a website that has MP3's available for download. I would then run a script or start a program that would comb through the website downloading all or specified MP3's.</p>  <p>I don't know where to start or if an application already exists. Please help.</p>
