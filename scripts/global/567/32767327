<p>Let me preface by apologizing for my ignorance; if this is a stupid question, my mistake.</p>  <p>I want to create a multiplayer Elo simulator in Excel. I had no need for this until <a href="http://elo.divergentinformatics.com/" rel="nofollow">the site I was using</a> went offline. I've been able to view it through wayback machine, but it's not usable. I'd like to retrieve the formula it used, but I can't find it in the HTML code. I'm unsure if this means it's not stored there, or I'm just bad at finding it; regardless, I'd like to know if there's a way to retrieve that data. I saw <a href="http://www.httrack.com/html/index.html" rel="nofollow">this tool</a> while searching through answers to questions on this site, and I'm not sure if it would be helpful for what I need. If so, could someone be kind enough to point out how to use it without retrieving the useless version? </p>
