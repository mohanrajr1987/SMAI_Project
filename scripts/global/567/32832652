<p>I have a fun challenge. Who ever can solve this first gets my thumbs up/vote. I have done a ton of research I need an HTML expert! </p>  <p>The website: <a href="http://www.barona.com/club-barona/email-signup/" rel="nofollow">http://www.barona.com/club-barona/email-signup/</a> has cut off text that I see in Chrome win 10 so far. Looks fine on the iphone. What is causing the cut off?
