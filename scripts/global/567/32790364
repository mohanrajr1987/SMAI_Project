<p>I want to create a discussion forum on my website. The title of the forum should become a static URL on my website domain address. This is very similar to how StackOverflow does it. </p>  <p>Example: If my domain address is <code>www.example.com</code>, then for every question posted on the website, I want to create a <code>GET</code> request like : <code>www.example.com/that-some-question-on-the-forum.htm</code></p>  <p>How to create such URLs and their corresponding pages?</p>
