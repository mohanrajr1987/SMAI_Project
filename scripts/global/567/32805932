<p>I'm new with website and mobile app development. I have many questions on how to proceed with the website creation and hosting. I found some resources and easy ways to start with.  I see that wordpress allows us to create UIs, but I see that it generates a PHP code, instead of HTML5. And I need to use a separate hosting server for hosting my website.</p>  <p>parse.com doesn't provide hosting services. It only provides the BAAS and eliminates my need for using a database.</p>  <p>But I'm confused how to use the website I developed using wordpress with parse.com? To what extent I can develop a social network site using wordpress and host it separately?</p>  <p>Any help on proceeding ahead would be appreciated.</p>
