<p>I'm dealing with a rare bug using Chrome 45 (Windows only). When I resize the web browser, suddenly the html tag gets the width and height value on auto, then the page gets blank (all html code is there, but invisible) I don't get it, don't understand how or why those values are set in "auto".</p>  <p>My tests has been using IE, FireFox, Chrome (also Canary), Opera on Windows Safari, Chrome 45 on Mac, Edge on Windows 10; the only browser that sets that value is Chrome 45 on Windows, the other browsers just sets the values on  px</p>  <p>Chrome seems doesn't like pages with higher 800px width values, so sets the value in auto.</p>  <p>Any ideas? Thanks in advance.</p>  <p>Rod</p>
