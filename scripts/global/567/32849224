<p>I made a social website where people from my class can ask questions and then it shows what time they uploaded the post, but i got 2 problems, first it's all in english and my website is danish. and the other problem is that it's showing what time it is when i'm refreshing. i made a while $row like this: </p>  <pre><code>while($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($select_all_posts_query)) {     $post_id = $row['post_id'];     $post_title = $row['post_title'];     $post_author = $row['post_author'];     $post_date = date("l H:i")     $post_image = $row['post_image'];     $post_content = substr($row['post_content'],0,100);     $post_tags = $row['post_tags'];     $post_comment_count = $row['post_comment_count']; </code></pre>  <p>And searched through the internet but without luck.. Can you guys help me out on this one?</p>
