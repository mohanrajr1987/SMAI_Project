<p>What if I delete the line <code>RewriteBase /</code> from <code>.htaccess</code>. I am using 000webhost server. Their CPanel code editor says:</p>  <pre><code># Do not remove this line, otherwise mod_rewrite rules will stop working RewriteBase / </code></pre>  <p>Please tell me, If I delete, it will stop my entire website? Or not so much dangerous?</p>  <p>I want to stop the ads that are showing by this server because it is free.</p>
