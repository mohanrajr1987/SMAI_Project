<p>I need to setup a website to show and sale my photographs. Im technical (i have a main job as a Java developer) but Im not really a web-designer so I don't want to build a website from scratch, I want to work off something that already looks good.</p>  <p>Many of these sites Ive looked at use Wordpress and I have found in the past amending Wordpress sites troublesome and I dont like the underlying technology used by Wordpress so Im looking for a modern existing site/template that just used html with some Javascript, also I want to be able to host it on my own server.</p>  <p>I know StackOverflow doesnt like to recommend specific sites but I dont know where to start so how can I find such a thing ? Can I have some recommendations please.</p>
