<p>I'm working through this <a href="http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/ios-8-creating-a-today-widget--cms-22379" rel="nofollow">tutorial</a> and it works just fine on a simulator, except I don't understand how the methods are being called. The today view widget displays fine but when I add breakpoints to the methods (e.g. ViewDidLoad, widgetPerformUpdateWithCompletionHandler) the breakpoints never seem to be called.</p>  <p>I'm trying to figure this out as I've added extra code - e.g. NSLog to display some values within the methods but do not see any output from the NSLog calls.</p>  <p>Can someone explain why the breakpoints are not working? I'm guessing that it has something to do with the extension methods are executing in the 'background'  but am not sure.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
