<p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/D6rRf.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/D6rRf.png" alt="This"></a> happens when I open the iOS Simulator on El Capitan - it opens a file picker and I can not do anything else. Closing the file picker closes the iOS Simulator. I can move the file picker dialog box and the iOS Simulator window freely around but only close the file picker, which also closes the iOS Simulator.</p>  <p>I couldn't find any settings for this nor can't I find any hints why this would happen...</p>
