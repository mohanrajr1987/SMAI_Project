<p>I have come across a strange issue with my simulator (on my iMac). It does not seem to replicate the code I have in Xcode. Even though if I run the same code on my Mac Book Air it works fine.  I have downloaded it to my iPhone and that works fine.  Not sure what I've done. I am running the app on Xcode 6.4 . Is it worth just deleting Xcode and then re-downloading ?</p>
