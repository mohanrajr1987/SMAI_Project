<p>I just updated to Xcode 7 and ran an app on a live device. Now for some reason, I get an error when I try to run a simulator. </p>  <pre><code>Stop “(null)”?  An instance of “(null)” is already running. Choose “Stop” to terminate and launch a new instance. </code></pre>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Zg1VY.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Zg1VY.png" alt="Image of the error pop-up in Xcode"></a></p>  <p>When I press the stop button it grays out, as in the screen shot, but nothing happens. I have tried resetting and content and settings on the simulator, but that didn't help.</p>
