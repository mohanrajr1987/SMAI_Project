<p>My app is iPad only and the root view is embedded in a navigation controller which has two sub views: </p>  <p>1) a <code>UITextView</code> (not <code>UITextField</code>) which covers the whole area except for the navigation bar.</p>  <p>2) another <code>UIView</code> which serves as a tool bar. It covers the UITextView and initially stays at the bottom of root view.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Kqg38.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Kqg38.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Now I can make the "tool bar" goes up and down in sync with the virtual keyboard. </p>  <p><strong>But there is one problem:</strong> if I rotates the device while the keyboard is showing, the "tool bar" no longer sticks to the top of virtual keyboard, instead it stays in the middle of the screen while rotating and falls down to meet the keyboard <strong>after rotation</strong>, which is quite ugly.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/oUiSM.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/oUiSM.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Currently I make the "tool bar" view goes up and down by dynamically adding and removing constraints on it and I am not sure whether this is a problem because I am only testing it using simulator.</p>  <p>Can anyone give me some advice on it?</p>  <p>Examples of such "UITextView with tool bar at the bottom" apps may be  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/documents-pro-7-free-office/id314894105?mt=8" rel="nofollow">Document Pro</a> or <a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/pages/" rel="nofollow">Pages</a>.</p>
