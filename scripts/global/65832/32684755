<p>I have a need in both versions of Xcode's - I do support/development for project on Swift 1.2 (and it is too big to port it right now to Swift 2.0) and I need to develop on Swift 2.0 for other project.  I used to have Xcode 6.4 and Xcode 7 beta and that was fine. Hoverer with Xcode 7 GM release thing got complicated as app bundle name isn't "Xcode Beta" anymore.</p>  <p>I installed Xcode 7 on top of Xcode 6 (it was a week ago, so I'm not 100% sure in that but I believe I overwrite Xcode 6.4). Then I downloaded Xcode 6.4 from developer.apple.com and installed it into /Applications/Xcode6/Xcode </p>  <ul> <li>When I run it - it doesn't have any simulators.</li> <li><code>sudo xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode6/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/</code> doesn't help I can't install simulators in <em>Window->Devices</em> - Xcode just freeze on the process of installing.</li> <li>Tried to run Simulator via <em>Xcode->Other Developer Tool->Simulator</em> - simulator freeze on the start (icon keep "jumping" in the dock).</li> </ul>  <p>Do you have any idea how I can fix that apart from installing 10.10 on separate partition</p>  <p><strong>Note:</strong> I'm aware that I won't be able to submit apps from 10.11. We have a build server, I just need a way to debug current code. </p>
