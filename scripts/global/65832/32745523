<p>I've just updated XCode to the 7.0 (7A220) and this take my Simulators to iOS9.</p>  <p>From that moment I cannot perform successfully any OAUTH call from the simulators.. I tried every model, from my App to the "sample Xamarin.Auth App".</p>  <p>The answer is always the same:</p>  <p>"Authentication Error</p>  <p>An SSL error has occurred and a secure connection to the server cannot be made"</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/celLe.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/celLe.png" alt="Exception I get"></a></p>  <p>The Code is the STANDARD one, I only changed my AppID. The same code is working on the Android version of the same App!</p>  <pre><code>var auth = new OAuth2Authenticator (             clientId: "my app id",             scope: "",             authorizeUrl: new Uri ("https://m.facebook.com/dialog/oauth/"),             redirectUrl: new Uri ("http://www.facebook.com/connect/login_success.html"));          auth.AllowCancel = allowCancel;          // If authorization succeeds or is canceled, .Completed will be fired.         auth.Completed += (s, e) =&gt;         {             // We presented the UI, so it's up to us to dismiss it.             dialog.DismissViewController (true, null);              if (!e.IsAuthenticated) {                 facebookStatus.Caption = "Not authorized";                 dialog.ReloadData();                 return;             }              // Now that we're logged in, make a OAuth2 request to get the user's info.             var request = new OAuth2Request ("GET", new Uri ("https://graph.facebook.com/me"), null, e.Account);             request.GetResponseAsync().ContinueWith (t =&gt; {                 if (t.IsFaulted)                     facebookStatus.Caption = "Error: " + t.Exception.InnerException.Message;                 else if (t.IsCanceled)                     facebookStatus.Caption = "Canceled";                 else                 {                     var obj = JsonValue.Parse (t.Result.GetResponseText());                     facebookStatus.Caption = "Logged in as " + obj["name"];                 }                  dialog.ReloadData();             }, uiScheduler);         };          UIViewController vc = auth.GetUI ();         dialog.PresentViewController (vc, true, null); </code></pre>  <p>The IOS9 Simulator can surf the web, so it is not a "connectivity problem". I also tried with Facebook SDK, same error. Could it be a certificate issue?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
