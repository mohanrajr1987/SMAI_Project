<p>My iPhone app launches in the simulator just fine until I add a Watch Framework from <code>New &gt; Target &gt; watchOS &gt; Watch Framework</code>. Once I add the framework target I get the "The operation couldnâ€™t be completed (LaunchServicesError error 0.)" error.</p>  <p>I've tried <code>"Reset Content and Settings"</code> in the simulator.</p>  <p>I've tried deleting all simulators from my computer and re-adding them.</p>  <p>I've cleaned the build folder.</p>  <p>I've done everything I can think of or find, but no one else seems to be reporting this issue.</p>  <p>Xcode 7.0, iOS 9 simulator</p>
