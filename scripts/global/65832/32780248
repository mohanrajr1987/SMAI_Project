<p>I just recently upgraded from Xcode 6 to Xcode 7 and I built a test viewcontroller with a single button on it.</p>  <p>When I run the app, the simulator is pretty big, and contains scrollbars by default both horizontally and vertically.</p>  <p>Is that normal or is there a way to make it fit on the Iphone 6 plus without the scrollbars?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/3NaPm.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/3NaPm.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
