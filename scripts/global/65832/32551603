<p>This is completely puzzling me, I am using Xcode 6.4 and iOS 8.4 and the iPhone 6 simulator.  I start a new vie controller project for the iPhone only, go to the main storyboard turn off auto layout, keep size class data for iPhone, and disable Size Classes.  I then put down four UIStepper one in each corner of the view in the main storyboard.  The build and run the app in the iPhone 6 simulator.</p>  <p>I have also tried cleaning the build folder and starting a new project altogether but this keeps happening. any suggestions would greatly be appreciated.</p>  <p>The picture shows the results being offset left and upwards.<a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/OwOzl.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/OwOzl.png" alt="enter image description here"></a><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/vkgTS.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/vkgTS.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
