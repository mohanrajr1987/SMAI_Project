<p>After upgrading to Xcode 7 with Swift 2, my Sprite Kit project is very laggy on the simulator.</p>  <p>It previously would get 60 fps, and now it maxes out at 15 fps. (If I remove all textures, it goes up to 60, but even adding a single screen-sized texture drops it all the way down to 15 again.)</p>  <p>I've tried running in release mode as well as debug, and it makes no difference.</p>  <p>It's still smooth on the device.</p>  <p>Has anybody else had this issue? Any fixes? It just makes it hard to test.</p>
