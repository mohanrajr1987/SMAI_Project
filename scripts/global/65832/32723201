<p>I am building a game for the iPad with SpriteKit and I am using image sets to manage the visual assets for the game. I am supplying both retina and non-retina assets, and specifying iPad only for each asset. </p>  <p>I recently updated Xcode to version 7.0 and certain simulators will not display certain assets. iPad 2 /iPad Retina displays only a handfull of assets. iPad Air displays around 80% of them.</p>  <p>There doesn't seem to be, on the surface, any difference between assets that display and don't display.  Has anyone else hit this issue at all? Is there a known issue around this and a resolution?</p>  <hr>  <p>Further investigation it seems that the iPad (specifically in my case) images are not displayed if the spriteKit asset is loaded using </p>  <pre><code>[SKSpriteNode spriteNodeWithImageNamed:];   </code></pre>  <p>The images display as expected when using the method: [SKSpriteNode spriteNodeWithTexture:]</p>  <hr>  <p>This openRadar post highlights the same problem.</p>  <p><a href="https://github.com/lionheart/openradar-mirror/issues/6084" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/lionheart/openradar-mirror/issues/6084</a></p>
