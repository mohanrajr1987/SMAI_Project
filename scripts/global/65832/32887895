<p>just wondering how you would test a cordova app onto an iPad without registering for the developer program. Xcode, which manages the simulator now allows you to do so without registering for the developer program. However, since I am not developing the app in Xcode, I wondered if this is possible at all.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/6XFCm.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/6XFCm.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
