<p>We have one iOS application with 2 project in the one workspace. And we have got a strange memory leaks:  if we create boost::shared_ptr with deleter in the second project and start application on simulator - deleter never called. Same code on the device works correct. Same code called from main project - works correct on simulator.</p>  <p>Does anyone know how to deal with this problem? I would appreciate any idea. </p>  <p>PS boost version in project v1.55, for boost build use modified version of <a href="https://github.com/mgrebenets/boost-xcode5-iosx" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/mgrebenets/boost-xcode5-iosx</a></p>  <p>PPS If it will explain the situation better: we have checked this situation many times with many codes. Final test was calling   boost::shared_ptr sp( new int[10], []( int *p ) { printf("Deleted\n"); delete[] p; } ); from different parts of projects. The result behavior described in the start of question.</p>
