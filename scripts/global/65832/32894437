<p>XCode 7.0.1 shows the iOS 8.4 and 8.3 Simulators as already downloaded. But the iOS 8.4 simulator is not available to create new simulator instances in the drop down menu.</p>  <p>The iOS 8.3 simulator works as expected.</p>  <p>I would like to redownload this simulator to see if that makes it functional.</p>  <p>I found similar situations for XCode 6, but those solutions do not seem to work with XCode 7.0.1.</p>  <p>The iOS 8.3 simulator works just fine.</p>
