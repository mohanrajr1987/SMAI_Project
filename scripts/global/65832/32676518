<p>I just installed Xcode 7.0 and simulator 9.0. Since installing this, when using the iPhone 4s/ 5 simulator, any image that is fetched from the Assets.xcassets file, will not display on the simulator, however the node count at the bottom states that the nodes are present.</p>  <p>When using the iPhone 5s simulator however, the images then appear. Any image that is part of an atlas seems to display no problems, regardless of the simulator device, just the images from the Assets.xcassets file are not being displayed.</p>  <p>When I tested the app on my iPhone 5, the images appeared as normal. However, I don't have an iPhone 4s to test my app on, so the simulator is the only tool I have to use for that device.</p>  <p>My deployment target is 8.0 and device target is iPhone. Images are stored in the Assets.xcassets file at iPhone 2x and 3x, there are no 1x. I haven't installed iOS 9 on my phone yet, still iOS 8. I'm going to installed iOS 9 shortly to see if the images then disappear on an iOS 9 device. </p>  <p>Does anybody know why these image are not being displayed on the iPhone 4s/ 5 simulator?</p>  <p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>  <p>I've now installed iOS 9 on my phone and now the images don't appear on that, as well as the simulator. I've checked out previous apps I've created and even those apps have lost all there images, since updating to iOS 9.</p>
