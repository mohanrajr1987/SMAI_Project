<p>I've been tasked with building a demo suite of our iOS application for our sales team to run on their laptops. </p>  <p>I know that I can install Xcode on their machines and then create a shortcut for the simulator, but that feels really heavyweight for our sales folks. </p>  <p>I've used my google foo and I see that there are several choices in the windows world, but I've not seen an alternative for OS X. Does anyone have suggestions for a standalone iOS emulator on OS X?</p>
