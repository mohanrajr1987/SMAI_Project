<p>I am writing my first swift app from Beginning iPhone Development with Swift.</p>  <p>OS X - 10.10.5 Xcode - 7.0 (7A220)</p>  <p>When I run my app, I notice two things:</p>  <p>First, the simulator is a completely black screen. I am pretty sure the expected result should be black characters on a white background.</p>  <p>And second, when I exit the hello world app, Xcode displays the "Invalid Device State" message.</p>  <p>I Googled the issue to death and was unable to find anything that helped in any way whatsoever.</p>  <p>Unfortunately, I am stuck at the very beginning of my attempt to learn Swift. With this in mind, I would gratefully appreciate any useful input.</p>  <p>Thank you VERY much, David</p>
