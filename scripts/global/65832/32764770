<p>Xcode 7 requires building simulator binaries against the provided SDK e.g. <code>$DEVELOPER_DIR/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator.sdk/</code> whereas it used to be able to be built against the OS X sdk.</p>  <p>My libjpeg-turbo build script builds the i386 and x86_64 binaries separately and lipo's them together with the armv7 and arm64 binaries.</p>  <p>The build works when building the i386 build against the simulator, but breaks during the x86_64 build during the configure step.</p>  <p>My config.log shows that when testing if the c compiler works, a linker error occurs.  </p>  <p>The configure command is effectively just, </p>  <pre><code>./configure --host x86_64-apple-darwin  ld: library not found for -lgcc_s.10.5 clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation) configure:3695: $? = 1 configure:3733: result: no configure: failed program was: | /* confdefs.h */ | #define PACKAGE_NAME "libjpeg-turbo" | #define PACKAGE_TARNAME "libjpeg-turbo" | #define PACKAGE_VERSION "1.4.80" | #define PACKAGE_STRING "libjpeg-turbo 1.4.80" | #define PACKAGE_BUGREPORT "" | #define PACKAGE_URL "" | #define PACKAGE "libjpeg-turbo" | #define VERSION "1.4.80" | /* end confdefs.h.  */ | | int | main () | { | |   ; |   return 0; | } configure:3738: error: in `/path/to/libjpegturbo/.tmp_build_obj': configure:3740: error: C compiler cannot create executables See `config.log' for more details </code></pre>  <p>Are these configure and make style builds to be done any differently now that they're using the iPhoneSimulator.sdk specifically instead of just clang that's installed with the system?  </p>  <p>For instance the device build produces armv7 and arm64 using just <code>configure --host aarch64-apple-darwin</code>.</p>
