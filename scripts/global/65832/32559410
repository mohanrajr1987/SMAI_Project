<p>I have installed the newest Xcode 7.1 beta and trying to run my project on the iPad Pro Simulator. Everything is right and all of the features work correct. </p>  <p>But I have an issue with the screen size...</p>  <p>On the main screen of application I run the next log:</p>  <pre><code>NSLog(@"%f", self.view.bounds.size.width); </code></pre>  <p>I have 1024 for landscape orientation. But when I create a new application in Xcode 7.1 and run the same code on the main screen I get another value: 1366.</p>  <p>Today I plan to find diffs between project files created in old Xcode (6.4) and newest beta 7.1 using Araxis Merge.</p>  <p>Do you now how to fix this issue for the my old project?</p>
