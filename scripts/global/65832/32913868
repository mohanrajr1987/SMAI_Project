<p>I was designing a login screen for an app. The screen itself is pretty simple. In the Storyboard editor I see:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/DGdq6.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/DGdq6.png" alt="Looks right"></a></p>  <p>When I run it on a simulator (iPhone 6s Plus), however, things do not seem right. The textfields do not appear:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/eYtDW.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/eYtDW.jpg" alt="No textfields"></a></p>  <p>If I click into the area where the textfield is supposed to be, I can see it is really there:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ooNQ3.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ooNQ3.jpg" alt="The cursor blinks, and I see the keyboard"></a></p>  <p>I think the issue might end up being just the display, but I want to make sure. Has anyone else had this happen? What was the reason for this issue?</p>
