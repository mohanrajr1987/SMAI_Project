<p>Does anyone know the fix to why my iOS Simulator is continuously showing a black screen with a white apple logo? I've searched on all sorts of forums, but no one has been able to give a concrete answer yet. </p>  <p>This has started to happen ever since I upgraded to Xcode 7, and I'm unable to run any of my applications on my iOS simulator. No matter how long I wait, it continues to show that screen.  </p>
