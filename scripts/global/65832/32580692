<p>i try to start a simulator in full screen with ui automation. How is it possible. Known someone a method to do it?</p>  <p>I have many errors on my tests, when i try to tap on different elements, i become this errors:</p>  <pre><code>Script threw an uncaught JavaScript error target.frontMostApp().navigationBar().buttons()["XXX"] could not be tapped </code></pre>  <p>I try different possibilities with index and not accessibility labels. But the problem appears sometime. I try to tap in full screen and see what happen. </p>  <p>Thank  Cheers </p>
