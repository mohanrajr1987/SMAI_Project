<p>I'm trying to install a plugin from a repository in eclipse but when I do it this error appears:  </p>  <blockquote>   <p>An error occurred while installing the items   session context was:(profile=epp.package.jee,   phase=org.eclipse.equinox.internal.p2.engine.phases.Install, operand=null -->   [R]com.googlecode.veloeclipse.ui 2.0.8, action=).   Failed to prepare partial IU: [R]com.googlecode.veloeclipse.ui 2.0.8.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I've read that by deleting the artifacts.xml file in the Eclipse root folder it solve the problem, but it doesn't.</p>  <p>How can we resolve this issue ? </p>
