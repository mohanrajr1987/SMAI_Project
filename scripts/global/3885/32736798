<p>I've implemented the following rules in my Xtext DSL:</p>  <pre><code>House:     'House' name=ID     description=STRING?     ('height' height=DOUBLE heightUnit=UNIT)? &amp;     ('width' width=DOUBLE widthUnit=UNIT)? &amp;     'end' 'House'      ;  enum UNIT:         m = 'm' |         cm = 'cm'     ; </code></pre>  <p>It allows me to define the following, using the editor based on that DSL:</p>  <pre><code>House MyHouse     "This is my house"     height 15.5 m     width 3000.2 cm end MyHouse </code></pre>  <p>How can I validate the units, defined by the user? For example, both height and width should have the unit <em>m</em> and if the user defines something different (<em>cm</em> for example), the editor should show an error.</p>  <p>I've checked <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/juno/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.xtext.doc%2Fcontents%2F030-tutorial-next-steps.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> site, which describes how to create validation rules, but where do I have to register them, so that they can work perperly?</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> As described in Ravens comment under his post, I've used reverse engineering and added the correspondig package and class, which now looks like the following:</p>  <pre><code>package com.language.validation  import com.language.mylanguage.House import org.eclipse.xtext.validation.Check  class MylanguageValidator {      @Check     def unitCheck(House house) {         val hWidth = house.width          if (hWidth != null) {             if (!hWidth.equals("m")) {                 val errorMsg = "House width must be defined in m";                 // error method undefined             }         }     } } </code></pre>  <p>The Package of the class is inside the plug-in project <code>com.language.mylanguage</code>. I am trying to validate, if the user used <em>m</em> as the unit. If not, an error message should appear. The method <code>error()</code> is undefined. Do I have to import or extend another class?</p>
