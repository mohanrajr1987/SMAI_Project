<p>I have a project A that I am using for two purposes: one as a library, and as a Eclipse plugin project that gives more support for the library.  I have other projects (e.g. project B) which want to use the library and so add project A to its build path (through Eclipse>Configure Build Path).  I've done this many times before I added the plugin "nature" to project A.  It worked as expected.</p>  <p>But now, If I run classes in project B as "Java Application" (or "JUnit Test"), they hang as soon as they attempt to put up a window (JFrame or JDialog).  It's deep in native code.  The debugger says:</p>  <pre><code>CGLGraphicsConfig.getCGLConfigInfo(int, int, int) line: not available [native method]    </code></pre>  <p>This happens even if the code in the class doesn't use anything in project A. Project B has some main classes that need project A and others which don't.  If I remove project A from project B's build path, then the classes that still compile can run fine, put up JDialogs, JFrames.</p>  <p>This is on MacOSX Yosemite running Java 7 or Java 8.  It was happening with Juno, and I upgraded to Kepler and then to Luna, with no success.  Still everything hangs.</p>  <p>I think that there must be something about a plugin project that puts something dangerous on the build path.  I tried putting project A at the very bottom (below the JRE) put it still causes this behavior.</p>  <p>I'm guessing that I could work around the problem by separating the project A into two parts, but that's annoying.</p>
