<p>I am developing an eclipse plugin which needs an com.lmax.disruptor.It imports sun.misc. I have this in my p2 repository but when I maven build my plugin I am getting this error "unable to satisfy dependency from com.lmax.disruptor 3.2.0 to package sun.misc 0.0.0."</p>  <p>I have gone through the sites <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20469049/resolve-a-dependency-on-package-sun-misc-with-tycho">Resolve a dependency on package sun.misc with Tycho</a> they are saying to create a plugin fragment but when I tried to create it and added export page as sun.misc, It is throwing an error like "package sun.misc doesnot exsist in the plugin".</p>  <p>How can solve this issue please help me with this.? Instead of creating new plugin fragment,is there is any possible way i can add in my plugin itself ?</p>  <p>Thanks, </p>
