<p>Using eclipse PDE, I'm running into this very strange error. I start up my plugin by right clicking on the project, Run As -> Eclipse Application.</p>  <p>The target eclipse seems to start up just fine, and in my development eclipse, a console view shows up but it's empty. I can't see any System.out.println's or any exception stacktraces or any of the usual stuff in there.</p>  <p>Answer to my problem below.</p>
