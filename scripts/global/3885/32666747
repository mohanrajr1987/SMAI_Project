<p>Using ASTParser I am parsing a class. Now my goal is to modify the class of one of the field.The field is available as FieldDeclaration now I want to create IType from the data type of  FieldDeclaration.</p>  <p>example:     class Dog{    private Collar c;    }</p>  <p>Here "private Collar c" is already available as FieldDeclaration .How is it possible to create IType of "Collar"?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
