<p>We are using maven to build application, install m2e and tomcat plugin in eclipse.</p>  <p>But sometimes, we have problems when deploy to tomcat, some jars in web-inf/lib are not copied to ws/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.wst.server.core/tmp0/wtpwebapps/mywebapp</p>  <p>I checked problems view to make sure there is no build eroror, also refresh projects, run maven update, run clean in servers view.</p>  <p>Also run maven clean install and check the built mywebapp.war and webapp folder in the target folder, there is no problem, the jars are there.</p>  <p>But somehow, eclipse tomcat plugin doesn't copy some jar into tmp0/wtpwebapps/mywebapp folder.</p>  <p>So I am wondering how Eclipse tomcat works, how it builds the application, and where are the built artifacts etc.</p>  <p>Thanks for any input and your help.</p>
