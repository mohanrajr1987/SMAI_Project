<p>I have developed an eclipse plugin which connects to a web server. While running the eclipse plugin as an eclipse application in development mode, I am able to connect to the server with the following properties set</p>  <pre><code>System.setProperty("javax.net.ssl.trustStore", keyStorePath); System.setProperty("javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword", "sibendu"); System.setProperty("https.protocols", "TLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2"); </code></pre>  <p>I am manually defining the keystore which contains the untrusted certificate of the web server.</p>  <p>While development , I am not facing any errors ,but if I install the eclipse plugin (in the form a jar file) in Eclipse Mars , I am facing the below error:</p>  <p>sun.security.validator.ValidatorException: PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target.</p>  <p>Can anyone explain why I am facing such an unexpected behaviour?</p>  <p>While debugging , I am able to connect to server but if I install the plugin , I am facing the issue!!!</p>  <p>====== UPDATE =======</p>  <p>Finally found out the issue. My development environmnent was Luna but I installed the jar file in Mars. After some investigation, I found out that the code is not working properly over there in Mars.</p>  <p>Are there any extra security features that has been incorporated into Mars as a client which is the cause for such errors?</p>
