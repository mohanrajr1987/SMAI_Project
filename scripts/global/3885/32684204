<p>it sounds like the entire contents of the Package Explorer view is exposed via the Common Navigator Framework.</p>  <p>How can I access this data though? I want to see the names of all the projects, files, and methods within. The closest I've gotten is:</p>  <pre><code>INavigatorContentService n = NavigatorContentServiceFactory.INSTANCE.createContentService(SampleView.ID); ITreeContentProvider tcp = n.createCommonContentProvider(); Object[] els = tcp.getElements(new Object()); </code></pre>  <p>but els is empty, probably because I have no idea what to pass into getElements.</p>  <p>Some interesting debugging: when I use the debugger to dive into the getElements call, it looks like findRootContentExtensions finds a bunch of NavigatorContentDescriptor's which look promising, but then they are not returned because they fail the isActive and isRootExtension checks. It then goes on to try to find other things to return, but it takes into account the object I pass in, and proceeds to not work. I haven't a clue what's going on.</p>  <p>All the documentation I've found focuses on adding a new view using the CNF, but not looking at the workspace's existing contents. Is there any good documentation for this? Thanks!</p>
