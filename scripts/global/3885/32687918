<p>I currently have an <code>RCP Eclipse</code> plug-in that goes into <code>IBM Lotus Notes</code>. I need to call the <code>notes.exe</code> binary with some arguments (kind of like from a .bat file), and I know how to do that when I know <em>WHERE</em> Notes is installed. </p>  <p><strong>How do I find out where <code>IBM Lotus Notes</code> is installed, so I can know where to call the <code>notes.exe</code> from?</strong></p>  <p>NOTE: Please don't suggest I look in the typical install folder, I'd like to be able to do it regardless of whether it's the typical default folder or not. Thanks</p>
