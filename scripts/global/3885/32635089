<p>I am trying to configure JAutodoc such that getter comments are generated containing only the <code>@returns</code> tag, like so:</p>  <pre><code>/**  * @returns The non-null {@linkplain Foo foo} of this {@link IBar}.  */ public Foo getFoo(); </code></pre>  <p>I have configured my getter template to produce this:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5JI3M.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5JI3M.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>However, something must be wrong with my general JAutodoc settings, because what I get instead is a hybrid of my template and a comment parsed from the method name:</p>  <pre><code>/**  * Get foo.  * @returns The non-null {@linkplain Foo foo} of this {@link IBar}.  */ public Foo getFoo(); </code></pre>  <p>These are my settings:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/z31uP.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/z31uP.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I have removed the 'get' replacement from the replacements list, as well as unchecked the 'etter from field comment' setting as advised in <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/jautodoc/discussion/601548/thread/d87981ef/" rel="nofollow">this discussion</a>, but it has not made a noticeable difference. I have also attempted to uncheck the 'Create comment from element name' setting, despite my example getter being part of an interface (in which case there <em>is</em> no element to get the comment from), but JAutodoc doesn't seem to care about that.</p>  <p>I have also tried restarting Eclipse after making each of these changes, in case that mattered. So far, nothing is working. It almost appears as if the comment behavior of getters is hard-coded. Can someone please shed some light on this?</p>
