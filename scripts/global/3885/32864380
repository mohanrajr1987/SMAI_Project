<p>Good day everyone. I'm using Eclipse Luna and trying to use EGit tools but, it isn't working anymore. </p>  <p>I only see apply patch in the "team" option: </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/eUl3G.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/eUl3G.png" alt="Apply patch"></a></p>  <p>Import -> git projects isn't showing as well : </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ayiI5.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ayiI5.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I checked preferences, and I didn't see git as well </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/f7QLj.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/f7QLj.png" alt="preferences"></a></p>  <p>I tried to switch workspace, running eclipse with -clean parameter, but it didn't help. I also checked if egit and jgit are installed, and they're installed: </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/lKbvt.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/lKbvt.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I checked the error Log and I found something: </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/03SCs.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/03SCs.png" alt="Error Log"></a></p>  <p>I hope someone can help me "restore" the Git thingy. Thanks! </p>
