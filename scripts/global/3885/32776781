<p>As mentioned in the Bluemix guide, I tried installing the Bluemix tool plugin on eclipse(Mars) with Java 7 installed on my Ubuntu machine.</p>  <p>1). Through the eclipse market place where Bluemix tool is present and the same fails with the following error when installation is nearly over:</p>  <pre><code>Cannot complete the install because one or more required items could not be found. Software currently installed: IBM Bluemix Tools 1.0.5.v20150801_1001  (com.ibm.cftools.feature.feature.group 1.0.5.v20150801_1001) Missing requirement: Bluemix Tools 1.0.6.v20150801_1001  (com.ibm.cftools.branding 1.0.6.v20150801_1001)  requires 'bundle org.eclipse.jst.server.core 0.0.0' but it could not be found Cannot satisfy dependency: From: Cloud Tools Branding UI Plugin 1.0.2.v20150801_1001  (com.ibm.cftools.branding.ui 1.0.2.v20150801_1001) To: package com.ibm.cftools.branding.internal 0.0.0 Cannot satisfy dependency: From: IBM Bluemix Tools 1.0.5.v20150801_1001  (com.ibm.cftools.feature.feature.group 1.0.5.v20150801_1001) To: com.ibm.cftools.branding.ui [1.0.2.v20150801_1001] </code></pre>  <p>I checked this exception and found a description about it in the eclipse web page. However, the remedy is missing for this particular problem.</p>  <p>2). Besides I tried to install the same via WASdev, but I ended up with the following error:</p>  <p><code>No repository found at http://public.dhe.ibm.com/ibmdl/export/pub/software/websphere/wasdev/updates/cloud/V1.0</code></p>  <p>However, the same page is accessible from any web browser. Also, I have checked my proxies and they are fine.</p>  <p>Please let me know if there is any solution or what I am doing wrong here. Thanks.</p>
