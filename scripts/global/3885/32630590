<p>I'm developing a eclipse plugin and i'm implementing the link with editor functionality.</p>  <p>My question is:</p>  <p>How do we know (on the EditorPart when this is activated) the actual value of the state of the link with editor command button (IWorkbenchCommandConstants.NAVIGATE_TOGGLE_LINK_WITH_EDITOR) if is active or not? in order to do something or not.</p>  <p>By the way is there any example source of how to do this?</p>
