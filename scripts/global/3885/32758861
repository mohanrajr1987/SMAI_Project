<p>Unable to access project resource from the workspace after project is imported in headless way.Below is the code which I am trying to get project name from workspace. ResourcePlugin.getWorkspace().getRoot().getProject(projectName).getName();</p>  <p>I am able to fetch root location and folder resource from the workspace.Also getProject(projectName) API is not null and has proper path and workspace attributes when checked in debug mode.</p>  <p>If I try to put sysout for below code  ResourcesPlugin.getWorkspace().getRoot().getProject(vecuProjName) , then it prints p\projectName on the console.</p>  <p>But after getting the Project instance if I try to use any API from IProject or IContainer or IResource then application terminates.</p>  <p>Workspace metadata has the project but inside the project folder its empty.If I try to open the same workspace in Eclipse IDE I can see the project in package explorer.</p>  <p>Why does the application terminates if I am trying to fetch project properties which exists in the given workspace?</p>
