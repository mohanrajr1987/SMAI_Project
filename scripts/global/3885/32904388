<p>I have implemented a custom view in my Eclipse plugin project, where I want to display different graphs, which are selected by the user. I have no problem with creating a custom view, using <code>org.eclipse.swt.graphics.GC</code> and drawing the required parts but I would like to implement the following:</p>  <p>Inside the custom view I want to have some fixed area on the bounds of the view, where I can display the coordinate system (x- and y-axis with the corresponding labeling), which is fixed. Between these bounds I would like to display the graph, which is changing dynamically, depending on user selection.</p>  <p>So what I need is a custom view, that is built like the following:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/guKW6.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/guKW6.png" alt="Mockup"></a></p>  <p>Inside the grey area on the left and on the bottom I want to have the coordinate system axes (shown red) and inside the white area I want to draw the graph.</p>  <p>How do I create such an area inside my view? It should just be a filed, without any translations or scales, just a independend area, like a view inside a view...</p>  <pre><code>@Override public void init(IViewSite site) throws PartInitException {     super.init(site); }  @Override public void createPartControl(Composite parent) {      canvas = new Canvas(parent, SWT.NONE);     canvas.addPaintListener(new PaintListener() {         public void paintControl(PaintEvent e) {             drawCoordinateSystem(e);             drawGraph(e);     });  public void drawCoordinateSystem(PaintEvent e) {     // 1. create area inside view     // 2. draw coordinate system }  public void drawGraph() {     // 3. draw graph } </code></pre>  <p>I know how to solve point 2 and 3. But I don't know, how to create such an area inside my view.</p>  <p>I would appreciate any help!</p>
