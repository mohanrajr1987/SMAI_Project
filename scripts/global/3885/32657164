<p>I need to run Maven  in the cmd line as follows:</p>  <p><strong>mvn clean install</strong> </p>  <p>using a <strong>pom.xml</strong> file within a <strong>locally cloned git repository</strong> that is an <strong>MQTT client</strong>.</p>  <p>Specifically, the git repository is: <strong>org.eclipse.paho.mqtt.java</strong>, within which the <strong>pom.xml</strong> exists.</p>  <p>This URL was used for the cloning of the above git repository: </p>  <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/jacarrichan/org.eclipse.paho.mqtt.java" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/jacarrichan/org.eclipse.paho.mqtt.java</a>.</strong> </p>  <p>**I need to use only an Maven Plug In for Eclipse, since most of the pom.xml files specify version numbers in the Eclipse plug in for various artifacts.</p>  <p>I cannot use a stand alone Maven downloaded and installed separately, or the Plug In which comes with Android Studio, for this reason.**</p>  <p>The problem now is that I am using the <strong>Eclipse that comes with the ADT Bundle</strong>, and it does not have <strong>Help ïƒ  Eclipse Market Places</strong> menu option, and there seems to be no way to <strong>Integrate Maven with the Eclipse that comes with the ADT Bundle.</strong></p>  <p><strong>Is there anyway to integrate Maven as a Plug In into the Eclipse that comes with the ADT Bundle?</strong></p>  <p>Thanks, Jaisimha Narahari</p>
