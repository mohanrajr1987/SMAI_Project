<p>I want to use C code in Android application for a set of operations. I have successfully installed Android ADT and downloaded then extracted NDK. I have already installed Additional new Softwares from  <code>https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/</code>. When I now want to add NDK path in eclipse it does not list in the  <strong>Windows->Preferences->Android</strong> location.</p>  <p>I am using Eclipse juno.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/fSfN6.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/fSfN6.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I have searched for it on internet but didn't got much help. Please point out if I am missing something here or guide through the process </p>
