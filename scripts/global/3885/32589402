<p>I want to make a Headless Console plugin and a UI plugin for Eclipse. Requirments are like this;</p>  <ul> <li>Headless plugin will be accessed from cmd</li> <li>Headless plugin will accept couple of parameters</li> <li>UI plugin will show windows to user to input these parameters</li> <li>UI plugin will trigger headless plugin with the parameters provided by user.</li> </ul>  <p>Headless plugin processes some resources when triggered. So calling only a method of headless plugin does not work for me. I have to have the bundle instance in the plugin to access the resources.</p>  <p>I need an approach on how to achieve starting a headless plugin from UI plugin. Headless plugin cont</p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
