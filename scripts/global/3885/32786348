<p>I have a eclipse plugin and I want to add a capability to generate java code blocks based on simple template or anything simple. Something like generate source for constructors or getters and setters that java editor provides.</p>  <p>I have seen the JET articles : <a href="https://eclipse.org/articles/Article-JET2/jet_tutorial2.html" rel="nofollow">https://eclipse.org/articles/Article-JET2/jet_tutorial2.html</a>  but I want something simpler.</p>
