<p>I'm have a plugin for Eclipse that creates a non Java project. Everything is working fine for my plugin. Now I need to add some Java files to my non java project and capability to edit the java files using the default java editor. Since it is a non java project I can't use the Create a Java class wizard and even if I create a .java file it does not open in a JAVA editor. </p>  <p>Is there a way to create a Java class using default wizards and edit the java files using default Java editor for a non JAVA project.</p>  <p>I have seen these answers  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11810188/eclipse-plugin-java-editor">Eclipse Plugin :java Editor</a> and I do not want to write a new java editor, I Just want to reuse if possible.</p>
