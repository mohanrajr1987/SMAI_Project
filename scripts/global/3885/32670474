<p>I am working on a Java Web Application in Eclipse. When checking my code with PMD, I get the following error:</p>  <pre><code>An internal error occurred during: "ReviewCode". com/infy/jcart/beans/Registration : Unsupported major.minor version 52.0 </code></pre>  <p>I have checked certain links on StackOverflow which talk about this error:</p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23624038/peculiar-eclipse-java-lang-unsupportedclassversionerror-unsupported-major-minor">Peculiar Eclipse java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError, Unsupported major.minor version 52.0</a></p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25890344/pmd-eclipse-plugin-error-an-internal-error-occurred-during-reviewcode">PMD Eclipse Plugin error: An internal error occurred during: &quot;ReviewCode&quot;</a></p>  <p>So, I have come to know that this error happens because of some incompatible JRE/JDK versions. I have set the compiler version to 1.8 properly and added JRE 1.8 in Build Path also. But still the error persists while checking PMD.</p>  <p>Any help is appreciated.</p>
