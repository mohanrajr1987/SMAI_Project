<p>I've got a question it's not code related, it's eclipse rated. So i installed the mcp (Minecraft Coder Pack) because if felt like modding the game, and to do so you need to change your java work-space, in doing so the look of eclipse changed.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/H5PXS.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/H5PXS.png" alt="Original"></a></p>  <p>That's what my eclipse usually looks like but when i opened up the new one it looked like this.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/wXrIx.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/wXrIx.png" alt="New"></a></p>  <p>My question is is there a way to fix it? I prefer the look of the original eclipse and the blocky one is just distracting. And doesn't look as cool.</p>
