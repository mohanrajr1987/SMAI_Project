<p>I've created a custom view in my Eclipse application using <a href="https://eclipse.org/articles/viewArticle/ViewArticle2.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> tutorial, which is responsible for visualizing a graph (defined by different points, stored in an array).</p>  <p>This view also contains a drop-down-menu, where the user can choose between diferent graph names.</p>  <p>This is my code:</p>  <pre><code>private List&lt;Action&gt; actionList = new ArrayList&lt;Action&gt;();  HashMap&lt;String, int[]&gt; graphCoordinates = new HashMap&lt;String, int[]&gt;();  @Override public void createPartControl(Composite parent) {     declareMaps();     createActions();     createMenu();      Canvas canvas = new Canvas(parent, SWT.NONE);     canvas.addPaintListener(new PaintListener() {         public void paintControl(PaintEvent e) {             if (graphCoordinates.isEmpty()) {                 declareGraphCoordinates(e.width, e.height);             }         }     }); }  private void createActions() {     for (String column : graphNames) {         Action action = new Action(column) {             public void run() {                 int[] polylinePoints = graphCoordinates.get(getId());                 // TODO: Draw!             }         };         action.setId(column);         actionList.add(action);     } }  private void createMenu() {     IMenuManager mgr = getViewSite().getActionBars().getMenuManager();     for (int i = 0; i &lt; graphNames.size(); i++) {         mgr.add(actionList.get(i));     } } </code></pre>  <p>The <code>declareMaps()</code> method is quite extensive. It declares maps, which hold the coordinates for the graphs, that have to be drawn. Mainly it adds the graphs to the <code>HashMap</code> <code>graphCoordinates</code>, where the key is the graph name and the value is an <code>int[]</code> with the polyline points. But this is not the problem.</p>  <p>In <code>createActions()</code> I am defining <code>Action</code> objects for each graph and store them in a <code>ArrayList</code>. In <code>createMenu()</code> I add the <code>Actions</code> to the menu.</p>  <p>This implementation allows the user to choose the graph name in the menu of my view and after he clicks one of them, the <code>run()</code> method of the corresponding <code>Action</code> is called. Inside that <code>run()</code> method I want to clear the view and draw the new graph, depending on the user decision with:</p>  <pre><code>e.gc.drawPolyline(graphCoordinates.get(userDecision)); </code></pre>  <p>Reading the user decision is also not the problem but how do I reset the view (deleting the old graph, if necessary) and draw the new graph? The drawing happens inside the <code>createPartControl()</code> method. Do I have to call it again or what would be the best way to implement that?</p>
