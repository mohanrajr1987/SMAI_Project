<p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/iOyap.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/iOyap.png" alt="enter image description here"></a> <br> I have a table with a button in each line. Each line has its own specific id. Is there a function in PHP that allows me to specify exactly which button is pressed? I mean when I click first button it should notify me that it was a button within a line with id='1', etc.</p>  <p>@edit</p>  <pre><code>function usunKontakt() {     var temp = $(this).parent().parent().children(":first-child").text();     console.log("Javascript: "+temp); } $("button.usun").click(usunKontakt); </code></pre>  <p>That's exactly what I want to do in PHP, what I made in jQuery. Is this possible in PHP?</p>
