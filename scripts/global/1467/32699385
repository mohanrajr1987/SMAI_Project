<p>I'm working over a (functional) Java code developed sometime ago, and for a given class its construct method only presents one attribute, while further down the code there is a set method for an attribute not previously mentioned in the construct.</p>  <p>The code structure is something like this:</p>  <pre><code>public class A{      public int attribute_1;     public int attribute_2;      public A(attribute_1){         this._at1 = attribute_1     }  ...      public void setAttribute_2(int attribute_2){         this._at2 = attribute_2     } } </code></pre>  <p>Can someone shed a light on why this works? Thank you in advance!</p>
