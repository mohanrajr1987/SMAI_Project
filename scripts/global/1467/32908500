<p>I need to create a class that that stores tax data as default values, but that can be populated with actual data from tax returns. So for instance, let's say I have three categories: income, statutory adjustments, and tax computation, each which contains several attributes. Ideally, I would like to have three self arguments that I can pass around to parts of a tax calculator. But I would want to be able to pass around each attribute in the self string individually. Right now I have this:</p>  <pre><code>class taxReturn:      def __init__(self):           self.income = [attribute1, attribute2, attribute3]         self.statut = [attribute4, attribute5, attribute6]         self.tax_comp = [attribute7, attribute8, attribute9] </code></pre>  <p>Each attribute would have to be set to a default value that could be passed around, but then later filled in with actual data.</p>  <p>Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!</p>
