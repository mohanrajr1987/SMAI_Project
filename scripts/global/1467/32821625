<p>I'm trying to build a list of names of all attributes in a class that are either pandas DataFrames or Series.  </p>  <p>The following works but seems slow since it goes through every attribute listed by <code>dir()</code> including special methods (the special methods won't be DataFrames so there's no need to check them).  It also seems to execute the <code>print</code> statements in other methods, so it is uncertain if the other attributes are being run (not desired).</p>  <pre><code>my_instance = MyClass() pd_objects = [attr for attr in dir(my_instance) if                isinstance(getattr(my_instance, attr), pd.DataFrame)               or isinstance(getattr(my_instance, attr), pd.Series)]  </code></pre>  <p>Any ideas on a more efficient way to quickly list attributes that are assigned pandas objects, perhaps using the <code>inspect</code> module? </p>
