<p>I am using an attribute to show an attribute value in the product page using this code:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php if ($_product-&gt;getProductShipping()):?&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Shipping Charges : Rs.&lt;?php echo $_product-&gt;getProductShipping(); ?&gt; &lt;?php endif;?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>It is showing <em>Shipping Charges : Rs. 20</em>. What is the value of this attribute? If some products have no value in this product then nothing is showing there but I want to show <em>Free shipping</em> if no value is there.</p>
