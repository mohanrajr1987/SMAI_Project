<p>I am quite new to Magento. Trying to adjuct configurable products for my use. I have an images shop where every image may have a special paper type and size. Therefore I have created a simple (non visible) product per each paper type where selected  N number of available for order sizes. I have merged simple products into configurable product by paper type attribute, but I cant seem to select a size now for picked paper type. Is there any way? What I would like to is to be able pick a paper type and select a size. What am I missing?  </p>
