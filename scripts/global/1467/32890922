<p>I want to retrieve an attribute from an entity to which the entity I am querying is connected via a one to one relationship.  I am fetching an object first in a table view using NSFetchedResultsController and then, if you select a row of the table, through prepareforsegue.</p>  <p>In the prepareforsegue in the tableviewcontroller, the item in question is identified through its index path and the destination view controller gets the object with the following code:</p>  <pre><code>Items *item = [self.fetchedResultsController objectAtIndexPath:indexPath]; IDDetailVC *destViewController = segue.destinationViewController; destViewController.item=item; </code></pre>  <p>Then in the detail or destination view controller, I have access to all the attribute of the item object through <code>self.item.attribute1</code> etc.</p>  <p>My question is, what is right way to create relationship with second entity, say Addresses, to get an attribute from it?  I have tried <code>item.address</code> and it throws an error while <code>address.address</code> is null.</p>
