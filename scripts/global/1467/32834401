<p>I would like to allow a user edit feature attributes when clicking on a feature. I know ArcGIS JS API has a very nice implementation for it, but I can't use ArcGIS JS, because my features are created from a geojson. At this point the only thing I have is this bindPopup window, which I would like to extend such that a user can actually select an attribute and edit it.  </p>  <p>I have seen <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17561436/leaflet-load-data-and-edit-feature-properties-on-mouse-click">this</a> post, but have no idea how to apply it to my case.  Googling also did not help unfortunately. </p>  <p>Here is my script with a simple popup. Any help will be highly appreciated. </p>  <pre><code>&lt;script&gt;   var map = L.map('map').setView([52.52,13.384], 13);   L.tileLayer('http://{s}.www.toolserver.org/tiles/bw-mapnik/{z}/{x}/{y}.png').addTo(map);    function onEachFeature(feature, layer) {   if (feature.properties) {       layer.bindPopup("&lt;b&gt;" + feature.properties.linkstr + "&lt;/b&gt; has flow " + feature.properties.flow + ".");     }   }    var streets = new L.geoJson(arcs, {       onEachFeature: onEachFeature   }).addTo(map); &lt;/script&gt; </code></pre>
