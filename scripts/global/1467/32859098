<p>I have the following question. If i have a relation such as </p>  <p>Request = {[Request_ID: Int,Status: String,Start_Time: Date]}</p>  <p>Request_ID is the primary attribute and Status and Start_Time are normal attributes. </p>  <p>If I would like to normalize the Status from String to Int for example my ref_Status table would look something like this.</p>  <p>Status_ID | Status Name</p>  <p>1         | New</p>  <p>2 | Old</p>  <p>3 | finished</p>  <p>Does through this normalization the Attribute Status become an Entity ? </p>  <p>Attributes are used to characterize an Entity which the Status-ID does but at the same time it is a foreign key to a different table even though it only holds the name which would hint me that this would be an Entity.</p>  <p>I would be really glad if someone could help me out with this.</p>  <p>Thank you in Advance and I hope my Question is clear.</p>
