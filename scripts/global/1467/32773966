<p>I get errors when trying to use code that uses attributes   <pre><code>Public Class &lt;AttributeUsageAttribute(Of AttributeTargets, AllowMultiple := True)&gt; CustomPermissionAttribute Inherits CodeAccessSecurityAttribute Private myUnrestricted As Boolean = False End Class </code></pre>  <p>When I get the error, VS goes the the first "&lt;". I'm just now starting to use code like this, so I'm basically pretty dumb about it, and any help is appreciated.</p>  <p>thanks for any help...</p>
