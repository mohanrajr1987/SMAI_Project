<p>I have some product attributes like so:</p>  <p>-Color (attribute)</p>  <p>--Blue (term) </p>  <p>---sky blue ( term with parent of blue)</p>  <p>--- navy ( term with parent of blue)</p>  <p>-- Red (term)</p>  <p>--- crimson (term with parent of red)</p>  <p>--- pink  (term with parent of red)</p>  <p>In my php I can get the id of a terms parent pretty easy with $term->parent but the next step in what I'm trying to achieve is baffling me. How can I somehow differentiate between the two. I'm not fussy I just need to be able to style them differently so if I am able to get the title/name/slug of the parent instead of just the id or if I can add a css class to the parent or child to separate them or any other suggestion,  I'm open to all. I have spent a fair amount of time searching for explanations on the usage of parent child terms but nothing out there. I've, through trial and error, tried many different code snippets but most would work with a post/category taxonomy but not attribute terms. I think it's because the terms aren't actually s taxonomy but a meta if the attribute. I really hope someone will be able to assist.</p>  <p>EDIT: I realise I should show my research so where I'm at so far.</p>  <p>I can get the parent ID of a term on certain taxonomies like 'product_cat' or 'category' using the following:</p>  <pre><code>wp_get_term_taxonomy_parent_id( $term_id, $taxonomy ); </code></pre>  <p>but this will not return any data when it comes to Attribute terms. There is no documentation on what type of taxonomy an attribute term is.</p>  <p>I can also get the term's parent ID with "$term_id->parent" but don't know of any option to get name/title of term parent.</p>  <p>I've also tried </p>  <pre><code>$parent = get_term($term-&gt;parent, get_query_var('taxonomy') ); $children = get_term_children($term-&gt;term_id, get_query_var('taxonomy'));     if(($parent-&gt;term_id!="" &amp;&amp; sizeof($children)&gt;0)) {          echo ('has parent and child');//     }elseif(($parent-&gt;term_id!="") &amp;&amp; (sizeof($children)==0)) {          echo ('has parent, no child');//     }elseif(($parent-&gt;term_id=="") &amp;&amp; (sizeof($children)&gt;0)) {          echo ('no parent, has child');//     } </code></pre>  <p>That returns the third option (no parent, has child) for all in the list regardless of whether the term has parent or child.</p>  <p>Hope that helps. If anyone can tell me what taxonomy type an attribute term actually is I may be able to solve it.</p>
