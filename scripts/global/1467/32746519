<p>I've been trying to figure out how to pass these attributes from a data class to an executable class correctly but I'm not sure how. Here's the data class:</p>  <pre><code>public class Motor {         private int cylinders;         private int hp;         private String type;         public Motor(int cylinders, int hp, String type) {             this.cylinders = cylinders;             this.hp = hp;             this.type = type;         }         public int getCylinders() {             return cylinders;         }         public int getHp() {             return hp;         }         public String getType() {             return type;         }         public String toString() {             return "Motor: cylinders=" + this.cylinders + ", hp=" +                      this.hp + ", type=" + this.type;         } } </code></pre>  <p>Now, in ANOTHER data class I'm supposed to reference Motor and make a bunch of other attributes. I don't have any(noticeable) errors with this one but I figured none of this would make any sense if I didn't post it:</p>  <pre><code>public class Vehicle {         private String make;         private String model;         private int year;         private double price;         private Motor motor;         public Vehicle(String make, String model, int year, double price, Motor motor) {             this.make = make;             this.model = model;             this.year = year;             this.price = price;             this.motor = motor;          }     public double getPrice() {             return price;         }         public void setPrice(double price) {             this.price = price;         }         public String toString() {             return "Vehicle make=" + this.make + ", model=" +                     this.model + ", year=" + this.year +                      ", price=" + this.price + ", motor=" +                     this.motor;         }     } </code></pre>  <p>This where the real problem is, when I created a Vehicle object in TestVehicle I get an error when I try to add the values for cylinder, hp and type from back in Motor:</p>  <pre><code>public class TestVehicle {      public static void main(String[] args) {         Vehicle v1 = new Vehicle("Toyota", "Corolla", 2015, 15999.0, 7, 300, "Gas");         System.out.println(v1.toString());      }  } </code></pre>  <p>The error I get when I try to execute it is: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.Error: Unresolved compilation problem:      The constructor Vehicle(String, String, int, double, int, int, String) is undefined</p>  <p>Thanks a lot!</p>
