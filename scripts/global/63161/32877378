<p>After performing a few underscore.js operations (<code>_.map</code>, <code>_.each</code>, <code>_.pluck</code>, and <code>_.flatten</code>), I have an array of objects that looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>var userArray = [   {id: 123456, username: "bill123", group: "ONE"},   {id: 123457, username: "joe123", group: "TWO"},   {id: 123457, username: "joe123", group: "TWO"},   {id: 123458, username: "jim123", group: "ONE"} ] </code></pre>  <p>I need to create a new array, with duplicates removed, and a count of how many times the object appeared in the array.  I am able to get the desired results with two separate <a href="http://underscorejs.org/" rel="nofollow">underscore.js</a> functions,  but am having trouble merging the two results.</p>  <p>The working functions are as follows:</p>  <pre><code>var uniqUsers = _.uniq(taggedUsers, false, function(user) {   return user.id });   //returns array of unique objects in the same format as above   //[{id: 123457, username: "joe123", group: "TWO"},...]  var userCounts = _.countBy(taggedUsers, "id");   //returns the count for each user in the userArray in a single object   //{123456: 1, 123457: 2, 123458: 1} </code></pre>  <p><br></p>  <p>What's the best approach for returning an array of objects like this:</p>  <pre><code>{id: 123457, username: "joe123", group: "TWO", count: 2} </code></pre>  <p>Can I add additional fields to the <code>_.countBy</code> function?  Or do I need to do something with <code>_.map</code>? </p>  <p>Any help would be greatly appreciated ! Thanks</p>
