<p>To start, here are some examples.</p>  <pre><code>['d', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'] ['c', 'd', 'e', 1, 2] // desired result: [1, 2]  [1, 2, 3] [2, 3, 4] // desired result: [4]  ['Hello', 'Goodbye', 'Goodbye', 'Hello'] ['Goodbye', 'Hello', 'Goodbye', 'Goodbye'] // desired result: ['Goodbye', 'Goodbye'] </code></pre>  <p>The elements are shifted n indexes (where n is less than the length of both arrays). The arrays are always the same length. They are always shifted from the right side of the array. Is there a way to do this?</p>  <p>I was thinking of finding the largest subset in both arrays then taking the right or something. Can't find a great way to approach it</p>
