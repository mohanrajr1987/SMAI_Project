<p>In my Node.js app, I have some ugly data:</p>  <pre><code>{"rn":["801"],"destSt":["30089"],"destNm":["95th/Dan Ryan"],"trDr":["5"],"nextStaId":["41430"],"nextStpId":["30276"],"nextStaNm":["87th"],"prdt":["20151003 12:36:48"],"arrT":["20151003 12:38:48"],"isApp":["0"],"isDly":["0"],"flags":[""],"lat":["41.75042"],"lon":["-87.62518"],"heading":["179"]} </code></pre>  <p>As you can see, each object property inexplicably contains an array with the value that should be directly the value of that propety. </p>  <p>I'd like to move everything up one level so that it looks like:</p>  <pre><code>{"rn":"801","destSt":"30089","destNm":"95th/Dan Ryan"} </code></pre>  <p>(etc)</p>  <p>In no case will any of those arrays contain any more than one value. </p>  <p>What's the best way to do this? I've tried underscore's flatten to no avail. </p>  <p>And I'm not sure how to go about Googling this. :)</p>
