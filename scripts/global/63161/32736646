<p>I have an object with arrays that contain each 5 objects. It looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>Object     1000: Array             0: Object                     column_id: "19"                     date: "20151005"                     start_time: "1000"                     end_time: "1100"             1: Object                     column_id: "19"                     date: "20151005"                     start_time: "1000"                     end_time: "1100"     0800: Array             0: Object                     column_id: "19"                     date: "20151005"                     start_time: "0800"                     end_time: "0900"             1: Object                     column_id: "19"                     date: "20151005"                     start_time: "0800"                     end_time: "0900"     0900: Array             0: Object                     column_id: "19"                     date: "20151005"                     start_time: "0900"                     end_time: "1000"             1: Object                     column_id: "19"                     date: "20151005"                     start_time: "0900"                     end_time: "1000" </code></pre>  <p>Now I would like to sort on the key every time (1000, 0800, 0900). That I have a result like this:</p>  <pre><code>Object     0800: Array             0: Object                     column_id: "19"                     date: "20151005"                     start_time: "0800"                     end_time: "0900"             1: Object                     column_id: "19"                     date: "20151005"                     start_time: "0800"                     end_time: "0900"     0900: Array             0: Object                     column_id: "19"                     date: "20151005"                     start_time: "0900"                     end_time: "1000"             1: Object                     column_id: "19"                     date: "20151005"                     start_time: "0900"                     end_time: "1000"     1000: Array             0: Object                     column_id: "19"                     date: "20151005"                     start_time: "1000"                     end_time: "1100"             1: Object                     column_id: "19"                     date: "20151005"                     start_time: "1000"                     end_time: "1100" </code></pre>  <p>The problem is when I do the following: <code>appointments = _.sortBy(appointments, 'start_time');</code></p>  <p>that I get this :</p>  <pre><code>Object     0: Array             0: Object                     column_id: "19"                     date: "20151005"                     start_time: "0800"                     end_time: "0900"             1: Object                     column_id: "19"                     date: "20151005"                     start_time: "0800"                     end_time: "0900"     1: Array             0: Object                     column_id: "19"                     date: "20151005"                     start_time: "0900"                     end_time: "1000"             1: Object                     column_id: "19"                     date: "20151005"                     start_time: "0900"                     end_time: "1000"     2: Array             0: Object                     column_id: "19"                     date: "20151005"                     start_time: "1000"                     end_time: "1100"             1: Object                     column_id: "19"                     date: "20151005"                     start_time: "1000"                     end_time: "1100" </code></pre>  <p>But I still need my keys like 0800, 0900, ... . How can I sort by the key and still keep the key?</p>  <p>I've tried to sort by key with this function:</p>  <pre><code>function sortObject(obj) {     return Object.keys(obj).sort().reduce(function (result, key) {         result[key] = obj[key];         return result;     }, {}); } </code></pre>  <p>but it gave me the same result. Maybe because 10000 comes before 0900. How can I do this that 0800 and 0900 are before 10000?</p>
