<p>I am looking to use <a href="http://underscorejs.org/#where" rel="nofollow"><em>.where</a> or <a href="http://underscorejs.org/#find" rel="nofollow"></em>.find</a> to look through an array of objects that look like:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/85hvo.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/85hvo.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Looking for anything that the user inputs that might match. </p>  <p>So imaging, you have this expanded object but you have an array of them. Well as you can see here, there is a relationship between this object (user) and profile (the expanded node). If I enter in (into a search box) "CA", I should get all matching elements back because as we see here: <code>user.profile.data.country === 'CA'</code> evaluates to true.</p>  <p>Now If I enter in "Kyle", again I should get this object back because the middle_name is Kyle.</p>  <p>The question is, how do I use <code>where</code> or <code>find</code> to search an array of objects, going as deep as their nesting goes to search for a value that matches?</p>  <p>An example of how deep nesting can go:</p>  <pre><code>- user   - profile   - contact_info   - id_verification   - investments (array)     - offering       - company </code></pre>  <p>If I type in "shoppers" and shoppers is a company it would then return that object. <strong>Ideas?</strong></p>
