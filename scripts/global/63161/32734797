<p>Is there any way in underscore.js to get the difference between two objects, tried with _.difference dosen't work. My object is like:</p>  <pre><code>$scope.ABC = {}; $scope.ABC.fruits = {}; $scope.ABC.vegetables = {}; $scope.ABC.fruits.places = []; $scope.ABC.fruits.type = []; $scope.ABC.vegetables.places = []; $scope.ABC.vegetables.type = []; </code></pre>  <p>The id is common for ABC object. now I have another object XYZ same as ABC, but which can have places or types value different from ABC.</p>  <p>Any way I can find the difference between the two.</p>  <p>_.difference(ABC,XYZ) dosen't work.</p>
