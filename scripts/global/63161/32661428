<p><a href="https://jsbin.com/tunika/3/edit?js,console" rel="nofollow">JSBin Link</a></p>  <p>When I run the code in the jsBin, I get the following object churned out: </p>  <pre><code>  Game Modding: [[object Object] {   event_type: "program",   icon: "game-modding",   title: "Game Modding",   type: "info" }, [object Object] {   event_type: "program",   icon: "game-modding",   title: "Game Modding",   type: "info" }, [object Object] {   event_type: "program",   icon: "game-modding"   title: "Game Modding",   type: "info" }] </code></pre>  <p>I need to get the <code>[object Object]</code> out of there, but after an hour of Google searching I'm not seeing anything that is telling me why it's showing up like this. </p>  <p>I'm using underscore to render and filter the data, and so far it's come together pretty quickly but this <code>object Object</code> thing is getting in the way of actually using my data. The whole point of this is that I'm trying to group events I'm given by their name and show the times that every event is offered and a single description of the event. </p>  <p>Any help is extremely appreciated! </p>
