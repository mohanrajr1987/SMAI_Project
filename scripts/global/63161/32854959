<p>I have been working on a web application for the past couple of years and have recently gone to make it more secure by adding Content Security Policy.</p>  <p>I have been able to remedy most of the issues I have found, but I have been unable to solve one remaining issue. CSP complains with an error message whenever templating occurs in underscore.js as I believe it makes use of a no-no; being the js code "new Function(...)".</p>  <p>I have seen other recommendations on the web, being basically:</p>  <ul> <li>Use an engine to precompile the template, eg <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-inline-template-compile" rel="nofollow">Grunt-inline-template-compile</a> This is useful for when you have your template strings inline, mine are all in the actual html in  tags, so this wouldn't be possible without drastic content moving around.</li> <li>Switch to another templating engine, this option would be more appealing to the previous but I am afraid it will break all the many lines of templating syntax of underscore and be a huge job in itself.</li> </ul>  <p>Are there any other options people are aware of?</p>
