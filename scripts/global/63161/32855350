<p>I've been trying to use <a href="http://underscorejs.org/" rel="nofollow">underscore.js</a> in a <a href="http://docs.meteor.com/#/full/" rel="nofollow">Meteor</a> project I'm working on, but can't seem to figure out how to transform a set of objects.</p>  <p>The objects look something like this (there's about 15k, but they all look like these two):</p>  <p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false"> <div class="snippet-code"> <pre class="snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override"><code> [{    "_id": "a_0011223344",    "taggedUsers": [{      "id": 1122244453,      "username": "john123"    }],    "field": "ABC"  }, {    "_id": "a_0011223345",    "taggedUsers": [{      "id": 1122244454,      "username": "bill123"    }, {      "id": 1122244455,      "username": "jim123"    }],    "field": "ABC"  }]</code></pre> </div> </div> </p>  <p>Each object can have one or more <code>"taggedUsers"</code> objects, and I need a list of the unique <code>"taggedUsers.username"</code> fields.  Meteor does not support mongoDB's <a href="http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/method/db.collection.distinct/" rel="nofollow">distinct</a> function, so I am trying to use underscore.js instead (per what I've read and the reccomendation in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23254699/meteor-how-to-search-for-only-distinct-field-values-aka-a-collection-distinct">this post</a>).  </p>  <p>In my server side console <code>db.myCollection.distinct("taggedUsers.username")</code> returns the desired result <code>["john123", "bill123", "jim123"]</code>, but I cannot replicate this in underscore.js.  </p>  <p>I have been trying a combination of <code>_.each</code>, <code>_.map</code>, <code>_.pluck</code>, and <code>_.uniq</code>, but have been unsuccessful.  I think it may have something with the fields being in embedded objects, but am not sure.</p>  <p>Ideally I would like to return an array of objects looking like this:</p>  <p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false"> <div class="snippet-code"> <pre class="snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>[{   "id": 1122244453,   "username": "john123",   "field": "ABC" }, {   "id": 1122244454,   "username": "bill123",   "field": "ABC" }, {   "id": 1122244455,   "username": "jim123",   "field": "DEF" }]</code></pre> </div> </div>  with just the <code>taggedUsers.username</code>, <code>taggedUsers.id</code>, and <code>field</code> feilds, and all duplicates removed, but would be happy if I could also just get an array of the <code>taggedUsers.usernames</code> like I am in the <code>db.colleciton.distinct()</code> function.</p>  <p>Ultimately it would be nice to know how to get the basic array, the array of unique objects, (or maybe even how to get the result of <code>db.collection.distinct()</code> in a template helper), but any help or a point in the right direction would be greatly appreciated!</p>
