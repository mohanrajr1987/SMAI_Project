<p>I have the following array:</p>  <pre><code>['aaa', 'bbb', 'ccc', 'ddd'] </code></pre>  <p>My goal is to remove from it unexpected values:</p>  <p>I tried to do it with underscore <code>without</code> function like below:</p>  <pre><code>_.without(['aaa', 'bbb', 'ccc', 'ddd'], 'bbb', 'ccc'); </code></pre>  <p>It works fine, but unfortunately it does not work with array:</p>  <pre><code>_.without(['aaa', 'bbb', 'ccc', 'ddd'], ['bbb', 'ccc']); </code></pre>  <p>I've googled a bit and find the post <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5722254/underscore-js-is-there-a-function-that-produces-an-array-thats-the-difference">underscore.js - Is there a function that produces an array thats the difference of two arrays?</a></p>  <p>But in my case this one also does not work, namely it returns somthing like that:</p>  <pre><code>"a","a","a" </code></pre>  <p>when I tired to use apply function.</p>  <p>Can some one suggest what need to be done to remove all unexpected keys with array?</p>
