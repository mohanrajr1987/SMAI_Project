<p>I'm thoroughly confused as to why the following underscore function is not working correctly.</p>  <pre><code>var testArray = [1, 2, 3, 4]; var resultingArray = _.first(testArray, 2); console.log(resultingArray); </code></pre>  <p>I keep getting <code>1</code> logged to the console. I've tried a similar exercise with <code>_.initial</code>, and again it appears to ignore the optional <code>n</code> arguments. Anyone have any idea what could be going on?</p>
