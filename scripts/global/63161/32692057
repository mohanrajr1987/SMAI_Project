<p>I'm currently looking into Haskell and i'm fascinated by some of its features, for example the end-recursive functions using an accumulator.</p>  <p>Questions:</p>  <ol> <li>Is there a construct in javascript similar to that? Or does it even make sense regarding efficiency since javascript is not as functional as Haskell?</li> <li>Is there any library like ramda, lodash, ... that supports this way of programming</li> <li><p>And if so, how would you write this for example in javascript:</p>  <pre><code> power_acc :: Double -&gt; Int -&gt; Double  power_acc x y = power_acc_h x y 1   power_acc_h :: Double -&gt; Int -&gt; Double -&gt; Double  power_acc_h x 0 acc = acc  power_acc_h x y acc = power_acc_h x (y-1) (acc*x) </code></pre></li> </ol>
