<p>I want to form a collection from a JSON based on the obtained value and Backbone's <code>where</code> seemed like a perfect tool, but it looks like it doesn't accept variables. Is it possible to achieve this sort of functionality using some of Backbone, Lodash or Underscore methods?</p>  <pre><code>### collection instantiated above  App.vent.on 'event', (obtained_value) -&gt;   desired_models = collection.where(attribute: obtained_value)   console.log desired_models  ### outputs empty array &gt;[] </code></pre>  <p>It does work when I pass <code>key: value</code> directly, but I need to form collection dynamically. Maybe I've initially taken a false route and the solution is in the another direction?</p>
