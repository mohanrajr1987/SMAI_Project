<p>With _.partial(f, _, _)(1, 2) I can partially apply and invoke the function f with the two arguments 1 and 2.</p>  <p>Hower this does not seem to work with the Datatype Prototype built-in functions, such as: String.prototype.split.call('a/b/c', '/')</p>  <p>How can I make them work with underscore's partial? This does not work:</p>  <p>_.partial(String.prototype.split.call, _, _)('a/b/c', '/')</p>
