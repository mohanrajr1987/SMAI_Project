<p>I have an object that looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>sum = {   value:{        a: 10,       b: 11   }   value2:{        a: 33,       c: 12   }   .. } </code></pre>  <p>My object is more complex, the letters really contains objects with different values, but the key thing is that, I wish to loop through all letters that exist in every value and return objects like:</p>  <pre><code>a:{   value: 10,   value2: 33 } </code></pre>  <p>I could loop through the entire thing build a new object, but is there a more effient way of "flipping an objects order?</p>  <p>I only want to use the keys that are present in all value-objects, I currently get them like this, but that is not a requirement.</p>  <pre><code>value = ['value', 'value2'] tags.forEach( (tag) =&gt;     keys.push(Object.keys(sum[tag])) ) matches = _.intersection.apply(_, keys);   matches.forEach( (match) =&gt; {   ... } </code></pre>
