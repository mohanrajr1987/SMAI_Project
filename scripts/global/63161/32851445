<p>I'm trying to use Underscore's "where" to filter an array of objects, but I can't seem to figure out how to get it to filter multiple values for the same key. For example:</p>  <pre><code>var itemsArr = [{name:"foo", color:"red"}, {name:"bar", color:"blue"}, {name:"bob", color:"yellow"}]; </code></pre>  <p>I'm trying to get it to return an array off all items with color "red" AND all items with color "blue"... Is this possible? I've tried</p>  <pre><code>tempArr = _.where(itemsArr, {color:["red", "blue"]});  </code></pre>  <p>but that didn't work. If I have to just use _.filter and write out my own predicate I will, but I was just wondering if anyone else had tried to do this and found a solution.  Thanks</p>
