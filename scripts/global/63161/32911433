<p>Hello sorry for my bad English</p>  <p>I have an application, which the client part is developed with Underscore and Backbone and the server in laravel. I have several queries to the database that are made in different views, these consultations conducted through laravel but as json step, some have a 13,000 lines and some 45,000 other lines, these queries are cached and works everything perfectly. I wish I could see only once these consultations and laravel siempe any view data become available. I have a url router.js that manages and renders the view but in each view when I do need this data:</p>  <pre><code>   initialize: function() {      //This is a collection          var os = new OS();      os.fetch()then(function(){       //select2 example load drop down      });    } </code></pre>
