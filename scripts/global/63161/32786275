<p>I was using list comprehension in Python and trying to translate to nodejs using underscore library . So in Python I have below (building list of ip addresses;):</p>  <pre><code>return ["10." + str(x) + "." + str(y) + ".1" for x in range(192, 256) for y in range(0, 256)] </code></pre>  <p>I know underscore can do _.range(192, 256) but is there an easy and short way to do all above in underscore or any js library ?</p>
