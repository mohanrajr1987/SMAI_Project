<p>I want to put the information in the following object on the front end using Angular's ng-repeat.  I need to order the key/value pairs by value and display them in that order in an array from the top down.</p>  <p>I have the following objects:</p>  <pre><code>{name: 32, name1: 7, name2: 83, name3: 19} </code></pre>  <p>I want to display something on the front end kind of like this:</p>  <p>name2: 83 name: 32 name3: 19 name1: 7</p>  <p>with the key/value pairs sorted in order of the values. I'm sure there is a simple way of doing this but I have yet to perceive it. </p>
