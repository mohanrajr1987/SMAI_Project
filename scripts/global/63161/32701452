<p>I'm iterating through some objects like so (using Underscore.js):</p>  <pre><code>      _.each(obj.Things, function(thing) {         _.each(thing.SubThings, function(subThing) {           _.each(subThing.SubSubThing, function(subSubThing) {             things.push(subSubThing);           });         });       }); </code></pre>  <p>I don't like how this looks, architecturally speaking. Is there a cleaner way to accomplish tasks like this?</p>
