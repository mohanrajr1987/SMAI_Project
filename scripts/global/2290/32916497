<p>Can anybody paste an example definition of a <code>Symfony2</code>/<code>Doctrine</code> model which has a primary key that is different than <em>id</em> (the name, e.g. the primary key is <em>customer_id</em>)?</p>  <p>I've been searching the web for this and I've scanned entire cheatsheet (<a href="http://ormcheatsheet.com/" rel="nofollow">http://ormcheatsheet.com/</a>) but couldn't find one.</p>  <p>For example, having following schema:</p>  <pre><code>author:   type: entity   fields:     id:       id: true       type: integer       generator:         strategy: AUTO </code></pre>  <p>what should I change to replace <em>id</em> with <em>author_id</em> preserving it remains the primary key?</p>
