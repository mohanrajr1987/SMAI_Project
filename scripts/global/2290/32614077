<p>Currently working on a Symfony2 application and I'm having some troubles with the lazy loading of objects.</p>  <p>I currently get all my matches with </p>  <pre><code>$matches = $this-&gt;getDoctrine()         -&gt;getRepository('AppBundle:Matchgame')         -&gt;findByTournament($tournament); </code></pre>  <p>All of the matches consist of a few details, like roundnumber and stuff and also holds the participants. These participants are from a ManyToOne relation.</p>  <pre><code>    /**      * @ORM\ManyToOne(targetEntity="User")      */     private $participant1;      /**      * @ORM\ManyToOne(targetEntity="User")      */     private $participant2; </code></pre>  <p>When I pass the $matches variable to my Twig template</p>  <pre><code>  {% for match in matches %}       &lt;p&gt;{{ match.participant1.username }}&lt;/p&gt;   {% endfor %} </code></pre>  <p>and then try to access the username, I get the error </p>  <pre><code>Impossible to access an attribute ("username") on a null variable in tournament/single.html.twig at line 46 </code></pre>  <p>Like I said, this is probably because of the lazy loading. But is there any workaround for this? In other words, can I tell Doctrine to fully load the request?</p>  <p>Thanks a bunch!</p>
