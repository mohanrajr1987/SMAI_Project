<p>I develop my website with Symfony2 on local it works great but when I put PHP app/console doctrine:schema:update --force on action hooks build file I got this error:</p>  <pre><code>[Doctrine\DBAL\Exception\ConnectionException] An exception occured in driver SQLSTATE[HY000] [2002] connection refused. </code></pre>  <p>It seem that all connections parameters to database is correct</p>
