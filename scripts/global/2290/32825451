<p>I'm trying to validate some quantity values to make sure I'm not saving them unless we have the stock to allocate to it.</p>  <p>The issue is that I'm using form collections and this means that if we have a delivery of 100 items to make and a user creates 2 rows on the dispatch form of 100 quantity each, then the validation will let both items get created instead of what I want, which is to allow the first to be saved but then error-ing on the second row.</p>  <p>It seems that validation is triggered when the <code>form-&gt;isValid()</code> is called but it seems that it should be possible to process row by row before the <code>form-&gt;isValid()</code> is called, I just cannot seem to figure it out.</p>  <p>If I cannot validate row by row is there any other ways to smoothly handle this kind of issue?</p>
