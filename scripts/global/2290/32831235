<p>I have a PreUpdate listener where I change entry version. I have my own Versioning system (just an integer field with a version number which is increased to the highest+1 when entity is changed).</p>  <p>So if I change sth, version is increased. I also use DoctrineExtensions Sortable. The problem is that I should change version to all of entities where the position is changed.</p>  <p>For instance if I change entity position to 4 I give this entity a new version (let's say 22). And with that five other entities have position being changed (for instance). So also for those five entities I should change the version to 22. Any idea how to achieve this without infinite loop made by PreUpdate event?</p>
