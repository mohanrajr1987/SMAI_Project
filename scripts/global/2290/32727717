<p>I currently am facing a little problem : I have a table of events, and would like to get which events are upcoming or ongoing.</p>  <p>So for instance we are on a Monday at 12:00, we have 3 events planned for today :</p>  <ul> <li><p>Event A starting at 10:00 and lasting 1h</p></li> <li><p>Event B starting at 11:00 and lasting 2h</p></li> <li><p>Event C starting at 13:00 and lasting 2h</p></li> </ul>  <p>In the end I would like to get Event B (ongoing) and Event C (upcoming).</p>  <p>I tried doing this (didn't work) :</p>  <pre><code>public function findAllPast(\Datetime $datetime)  {     $query = $this-&gt;createQueryBuilder('event')         -&gt;where('event.startTime + event.duration &gt;= :time')         -&gt;setParameter('time', $datetime)         -&gt;getQuery();      return $query-&gt;getResult();     } </code></pre>  <p>Searching around, I came onto the SQL ADDTIME() function. I'd pretty much like to do a where('ADDTIME(event.startTime, event.duration) >= :time'), but this isn't recognized by Doctrine.</p>  <p>Is there any proper way of doing this without brutal native SQL ?</p>
