<p>I am trying to get parts which have certain attributes. Each <code>part</code> has many attributes, and each <code>attribute</code> has an <code>attributeheader</code>. So there's three tables that I need to use.</p>  <pre><code>SELECT * FROM Part p  LEFT JOIN p.attributes pa JOIN pa.attributeheader pah WHERE (sph.name = 'size' AND sp.value IN ('11'))  AND (sph.name = 'colour' AND sp.value IN ('Black')) </code></pre>  <p>This returns nothing as I've gone wrong somewhere on the JOIN, or the lack of grouping. I'm trying to select the parts which have both attributes, so using <code>OR</code> is not a solution. I can't quite work out how to go about this - using raw MySQL I would use aliases on the join.</p>
