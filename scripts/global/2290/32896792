<p>The situations' setup is like this:</p>  <p>1) I have two bundles in which I would like to use the same entity. So as suggested in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18206201/doctrine2-symfony2-multiple-entities-on-same-table">this question</a> and then in <a href="http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/doctrine/resolve_target_entity.html" rel="nofollow">this article</a>, I created the CommonEntitiesBundle where the desired Entity lives. </p>  <p>2) Then I described the model interface in both bundles I want to use the Entity in. So far so good.</p>  <p>Now I would like to use the interfaced Entity, just like I would use a 'bundle-native' one like this:</p>  <pre><code>$clientData = new Client(); // the Entity class $client-&gt;setName('Greg'); </code></pre>  <p>How should I approach it when there is only the interface available?</p>  <p>I <code>use</code>d the interface in this controller.</p>  <p>In the Symfony's example there is only a use of the class via the ORM annotations.</p>
