<p>I'm new to Apigility, and I've been trying to setup the mongo db using doctorine, I already added ("doctrine/mongodb-odm": "1.0.0-BETA13") and updated my composer.</p>  <p>And tested the mongodb connection and it's OK from a normal PHP page.</p>  <p>PHP code like below:</p>  <pre><code>$mongoDB = new MongoClient(...my connection string..); $database = $mongoDB-&gt;selectDB("example"); $collection = $database-&gt;createCollection('TestCollection'); $collection-&gt;insert(array('test' =&gt; 'Test OK')); </code></pre>  <p>But I cannot get my Apigility to connect, and I'm not finding anything in the documentations or the forums that helps with that.</p>  <p>How to set this up?</p>
