<p>I have a few entities that have a few associations. They are loading up fine now. So I basically have a customer entity, that relates to an address entity. I also have a receipt transaction that relates to a customer. </p>  <p>When I retrieve a small set of customers I want to retrieve their related receipts but that set is huge. I want just the receipts from the last 2 weeks. </p>  <p>I thought that I could use a custom repository then use a function like customer->getRecentReceipts() but that doesn't work since the customer entity doesn't know about the repository. And from reading on this forum, people seem to say not to use the repository this way. How should I structure things to limit the loading of my receipt entities. I'm trying to avoid loading all then sorting them with a php routine. </p>
