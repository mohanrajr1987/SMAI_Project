<p>I'm a bit confused about relations between entities like manyToMany, oneToMany etc.</p>  <p>What i'm confused about exactly is, if i remove or delete a record from database, how can we say delete relational entities either.</p>  <p>For example:</p>  <h1>manyToMany</h1>  <p>Category Entity:</p>  <pre><code>manyToMany:     posts:       targetEntity: PostEntity       mappedBy: taxonomies </code></pre>  <p>Scenario one:</p>  <p>If you remove or delete one of these categories, immediately delete all relations in <code>post_taxonomy_relations</code> table. What can we use to do this? Cascade or Orphanremoval?</p>  <p>Post Entity:</p>  <pre><code>manyToMany:     taxonomies:       targetEntity: TaxonomyEntity       inversedBy: posts       joinTable:         name: post_taxonomy_relations         joinColumns:           post_id:             referencedColumnName: id         inverseJoinColumns:           taxonomy_id:             referencedColumnName: id </code></pre>  <p>Scenario two: </p>  <p>If you only delete (db level) one of these records, delete related entity in <code>post_taxonomy_relations</code></p>  <h1>oneToMany &amp; manyToOne</h1>  <p>Post Template Entity:</p>  <pre><code>  oneToMany:     products:       targetEntity: PostEntity       cascade: ["remove"]       mappedBy: post_template       joinColumn:         name: id         referencedColumnName: template_id </code></pre>  <p>Scenario one:</p>  <p>If you remove one of these entities, remove related posts either. Works with <code>cascade: ["remove"]</code>. But if you delete this entity (db level) set null or delete related posts too. How can we do this?</p>  <p>Post Entity:</p>  <pre><code>  manyToOne:     template:       targetEntity: PostTemplateEntity       inversedBy: products       joinColumn:         name: template_id         referencedColumnName: id </code></pre>  <p>If you remove or delete this post, do nothing.</p>  <p>Okay, i'm trying to get used to these cascade operations.</p>  <p>Every answer that has samples in it, are most valuable for me. Thank you.</p>
