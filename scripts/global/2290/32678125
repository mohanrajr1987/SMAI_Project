<p>Is there a way to add a parameter (condition) in every <code>where</code> clause by default? For example, if normal query is <code>select * from abc where col1 = 2</code> then I want to add <code>AND col100 = somevalue</code> to the above query when symfony/doctrine executes the query.</p>  <p>So whatever type of query system executes (select, update, delete) one additional column should be added at the time of execution.</p>  <p>Is that possible?</p>
