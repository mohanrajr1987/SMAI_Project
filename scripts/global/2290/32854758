<p>Well I am finally started to learn Symfony and I think peoples will understand my question (I Hope) and my wish to structure my code...</p>  <p>Well, I would like to create a Class which is called Reception and this class has a sql let's say in each methods/function. Each and evry methods can return a different nombre of column results. </p>  <p>Example :  Sql 1 : Jo;DATE; Sql 2 : Client;Car;Time</p>  <p>Let's tell that I don't want to create a Entity to use it with doctrine...</p>  <p>I would like to use DBAL (pdo doctrine sql query) to do execute my queries... like in normal PHP poo programming. </p>  <p>Finally the question is : wether I should do this class as a Service, Entity? or I can simple put the pdo query in the controller....</p>  <p>Thanks in advance for your answers... I avoid doctrine for the moment because I principaly doing some statistiques and also to play a bit with symfony and to increase the difficutly level progresivly... </p>  <p>thanks for your understanding... Good Day</p>
