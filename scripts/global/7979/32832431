<p>I have list of timestamps in the format of HH:MM:SS and want to plot against some values using datetime.time. Seems like python doesn't like the way I do it. Can someone please help ?</p>  <pre><code>import datetime import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # random data x = [datetime.time(12,10,10), datetime.time(12, 11, 10)] y = [1,5]  # plot plt.plot(x,y) plt.show()  *TypeError: float() argument must be a string or a number* </code></pre>
