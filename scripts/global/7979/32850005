<p>I am trying to plot graph of internet speed. In graph both downloading and uploading speed should show with time series.</p>  <p>Both speeds and date time have saved to a csv file.  And the file has time, download speed and upload speed in first, second and third column. </p>  <p>I need a graph with time in X axis and both speed in Y axis. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks</p>
