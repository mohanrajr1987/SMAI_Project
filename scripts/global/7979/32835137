<p>I have a plot which has three legends of different length and width. I'm trying to find a way to place them nicely onto the plot. Currently I'm placing them with the default <code>loc=</code> which is great for dealing with the vertical placement. The issue is that by default the legends are right aligned, which looks messy.</p>  <p>Is there a way to use the default <code>loc=</code> to place them on the plot, but to have them left aligned?</p>  <p>Example: From the <a href="http://matplotlib.org/users/legend_guide.html#plotting-guide-legend" rel="nofollow">legend guide</a>.</p>  <pre><code>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  line1, = plt.plot([1,2,3], label="Line 1", linestyle='--') line2, = plt.plot([3,2,1], label="Line 2\nThis is a \nvery long\nlegend", linewidth=4) line3, = plt.plot([2,2,2], label="Can this be left justified?")  # Create a legend for the first two lines. # 'loc' puts them in a nice place on the right. first_legend = plt.legend(handles=[line1], loc=1) second_legend = plt.legend(handles=[line2], loc=5)  # Add the legends manually to the current Axes. ax = plt.gca().add_artist(first_legend) ax = plt.gca().add_artist(second_legend)  # Create another legend for the last line. plt.legend(handles=[line3], loc=4)  plt.show() </code></pre>  <p>Which gives this</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/QnuE6.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/QnuE6.png" alt="three legend plot"></a></p>  <p>Now what I would really like is for the legends to left aligned but still on the right side of the plot. Like so:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/AUCY4.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/AUCY4.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I know I can place them at a specific location but to do this I need to specify both the x and y coords, which will be fiddly since all 3 have variable heights and widths.</p>
