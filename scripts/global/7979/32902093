<p>I am fetching yahoo finance data in Python through this interface:</p>  <p>matplotlib.finance.quotes_historical_yahoo_ohlc(ticker, start_date, end_date)</p>  <p>I find this interface very convenient as prices are automatically adjusted, and the data is made available in a convenient data structure.</p>  <p>However, I recently found that matplotlib.finance uses a local cache (matplotlib.get_cachedir() tells me my cache is in ~/.matplotlib). I would like to avoid using any sort of local cache as I want to ensure that any data I request is not stale. But I am unable to figure out an option to turn local caching off. At the very least, I would like to understand the controls that reset this local cache in ~/.matplotlib. </p>
