<p>I used python code found on this website from the question ('<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24659005/radar-chart-with-multiple-scales-on-multiple-axes">Radar chart with multiple scales on multiple axes</a>'). It works great and was able to create exactly what I wanted.</p>  <p>Except that when I use <code>fig.tight_layout()</code>, I get the following error </p>  <blockquote>   <p>C:\Anaconda3\lib\site-packages\matplotlib\figure.py:1653: UserWarning: This figure includes Axes that are not compatible with tight_layout, so its results might be incorrect.     warnings.warn("This figure includes Axes that are not "</p> </blockquote>  <p>And the figure is not save correctly.... quite a bit of it is cropped off. Could someone advise how I can get around this issue? I save the figure as a pdf. Thank you for your help.</p>  <p>Daniel</p>
