<p>I have a piece of code below and want to find the regression to the line (how good the data points match this line). I want my fit to be second order polynomial. How can i do this? and is there a method which takes errors into consideration.</p>  <pre><code>plt.errorbar(x,y,fmt='*') z = np.polyfit(x, y, 2) xxx=np.linspace(0.65,2,10) ppp = np.poly1d(z) plt.plot(xxx,ppp(xxx)) </code></pre>
