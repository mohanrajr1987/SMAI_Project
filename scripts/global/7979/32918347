<p>I am trying to get the values of <code>xticks</code> from one plot and then use these values for another plot but set the new ticks as 10 to the power of the other plot's ticks. The following lines doesn't do the job I am aiming for</p>  <pre><code>labels=[item for item in ax1.get_xticklabels()] ax2.set_xticklabels(['$10^{{{:d}}}$'.format(int(i)) for i in labels]) </code></pre>  <p>I will appreciate for any suggestion.</p>
