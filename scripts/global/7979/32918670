<p>I am graphing +-2 standard deviations from the mean on my graph (the green points). However, I would rather have straight vertical lines on top of each x-mean, because currently there is a connecting shade area between states that is misleading. How can I do this? I've tried everything and can't figure it out. Thanks in advance. (Since I'm new to Stack Overflow I can't post an image of my graph unfortunately.)</p>  <pre><code>plt.scatter(x= joined.index.values, y = joined.poll_mean, color = "g") plt.scatter(x= joined.index.values, y = joined.spread,color = joined.color)       plt.fill_between(joined.index,(joined.poll_mean + 2*joined.poll_std).values, (joined.poll_mean - 2*joined.poll_std).values, color='g', alpha = .3) plt.xticks(joined.index.values, joined.state.values, rotation='vertical') </code></pre>
