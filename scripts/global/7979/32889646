<p>I have a <code>numpy</code> array <strong><code>A</code></strong>, having a shape of <code>(60,60,3)</code>, and I am using:</p>  <pre><code>plt.imshow(  A,              cmap          = plt.cm.gist_yarg,              interpolation = 'nearest',              aspect        = 'equal',              shape         = A.shape              ) plt.savefig( 'myfig.png' ) </code></pre>  <p>When I examine the <code>myfig.png</code> file, I see that it is 1200x800 pixels (in color).</p>  <p>What's going on here? I was expecting a 60x60 RGB image.</p>
