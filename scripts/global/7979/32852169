<p>I want to change the labels of a plot</p>  <pre><code>fig=figure(figsize=(7.5,7.5)) labels = [0,0.00001,0.0001,0.001,0.01,0.1,1] plt.xscale('log') plt.xlim(10^-6,1.1)  plt.xticks(y, labels) </code></pre>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/GGIo1.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/GGIo1.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>However I would like to have the labels in the format <code>10^-5, 10^-4, 10^-3, 10^-2, 10^-1, 1</code> instead of <code>1e-05, 0.0001, 0,001, 0,01, 0.1, 1</code></p>
