<p>How can I plot a two point line segment plot as shown in the following figure <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/CltiQ.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/CltiQ.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>The data is like below</p>  <p>x = [1,2,3,4,5,6]</p>  <p>y = [1.2,1.2,-2.1, -2.1, 4.1, -4.1]   #these y values are always in pair such that I need a solid line to connect these equivalent values and then a dotted line between this pair and the next pair.</p>
