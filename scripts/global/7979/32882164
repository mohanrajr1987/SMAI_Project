<p>How to have no spaces between subplots in this example ?</p>  <p>(And keep a good visualization if I have more lines) </p>  <p>I've seen that what we see can change a lot with a value for figsize.</p>  <p>So do we have to guess the "correct" value for figsize ? </p>  <pre><code>fig = plt.figure() ax = fig.add_subplot(211) ax.matshow([[1,2,3,4,5]]) ax = fig.add_subplot(212) ax.matshow([[5,4,3,2,1]]) plt.subplots_adjust(wspace=0, hspace=0) </code></pre>  <p>I've tried to use something different like gridspec but I have exactly the same issue.</p>
