<p>I want to plot the following quadratic form:</p>  <pre><code>f(x) = 1/2 x^T * A * x -b^T *x  </code></pre>  <p>where A is a 2x2 matrix.  x1-axis: [-6,4] x2-axis: [-4,6]</p>  <p>I did the following:</p>  <pre><code>x = arange(-6,4,0.1) y = arange(-4,6,0.1) </code></pre>  <p>So both x and y conatain 100 points. Now I want to evaluate the quadratic form at all those pairs of points, i.e. I get 100*100 = 10000 points.</p>  <p>Done by the following code:</p>  <pre><code>res= [] for a in x:     for b in y:         val = f(array([a,b]))         res.append(val) </code></pre>  <p>Now I want to make a kind of surface plot. Can anyone help me figure out how to do this? I tried:</p>  <pre><code>fig = plt.figure() ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d') surf = ax.plot_surface(x, y, res) </code></pre>  <p>I think the following method should be help but I really do not know how exactly:</p>  <p>griddata- Interpolates from a nonuniformly spaced grid to some other grid.</p>  <p>any ideas? </p>
