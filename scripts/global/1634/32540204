<p>I'm trying to add a rule for a custom post type. By default, the URL to view post is www.mydomain.com/job/post-slug</p>  <p>What I'd like, is the post also accessible with the following URL:</p>  <p>www.mydomain.com/j/postid</p>  <p>I've tried this in my functions.php file and I also refresh permalinks in admin settings:</p>  <pre><code>function rewrite_short_job_url() {      add_rewrite_rule( '^j/([0-9]+)/?', 'index.php?post_type=job&amp;id=$matches[1]', 'top' );     flush_rewrite_rules( true );  }  add_action( 'init', 'rewrite_short_job_url' ); </code></pre>  <p>Doesn't work for me, I'm trying to understand the Rewrite API but cannot find a solution.</p>
