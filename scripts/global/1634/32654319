<p>I have a file with an identical name that exists in 15 subdirectories. Let's say it's called <code>blah.txt</code>. </p>  <p>I'm looking to do a global rewrite within <code>httpd.conf</code> to match any subdirectory's <code>blah.txt</code> and Rewrite it to a singular <code>http://myserver/blah.txt</code>.</p>  <p>If I add the following to an <code>.htaccess</code>, it works great. I hit the subdirectory's txt file, and I'm 301 forwarded. However doing this means I need to manage 15 .htaccess's. I'm trying to avoid that. </p>  <pre><code>RewriteEngine On RewriteRule ^(blah)\.txt http://myserver/blah.txt [L,R=301] </code></pre>  <p>If I put this same text into httpd.conf under the <code>&lt;Directory /&gt;</code> section, I get a 404 on the subdirectory's <code>blah.txt</code>. </p>  <pre><code>&lt;Directory /&gt;     Options All Indexes FollowSymLinks     AllowOverride All     Allow from all      RewriteEngine On     RewriteRule ^(blah)\.txt http://myserver/blah.txt [L,R=301]   &lt;/Directory&gt; </code></pre>  <p>How can I have this global match within <code>httpd.conf</code>?</p>  <p><strong>Edit:</strong> If I change the <code>httpd.conf</code> rewrite to the below, it seems like it <em>wants</em> to work, however I get stuck in an infinite loop because it's constantly matching the same file name. </p>  <pre><code>    RewriteEngine On     RewriteRule blah.txt http://myserver/blah.txt [L,R=301] </code></pre>  <p>Still looking for a way to have it match in subdirectories and redirect to the same filename. </p>  <p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> I think I got this working - but would love confirmation!</p>  <p>I added a <code>RewriteCond</code> to my rule. Basically, I think, this means that if the URI does not contain "firmware", then rewrite.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;Directory /&gt;     Options All Indexes FollowSymLinks     AllowOverride All     Allow from all      RewriteEngine On     RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !(firmware) [NC]     RewriteRule blah.txt firmware/series/version/blah.txt [R=301,L]  &lt;/Directory&gt; </code></pre>  <p>It seems to be working without looping</p>
