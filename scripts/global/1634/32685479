<p>I've created an htaccess file for my website that converts a URL like this <code>http://www.example.com/fixture?id=1</code> to something like <code>http://www.example.com/fixtures/1</code>.  </p>  <p>My htaccess file:</p>  <pre><code>RewriteCond %{SCRIPT_FILENAME} !-d RewriteCond %{SCRIPT_FILENAME} !-f RewriteRule ^fixtures/(\d+)*$ fixture.php?id=$1 </code></pre>  <p>That works how I want it, but isn't exactly SEO friendly, so I'd like to pass in two more variables <code>home</code> and <code>away</code> like so <code>http://www.example.com/fixture?id=1&amp;home=Arsenal&amp;away=Chelsea</code>.</p>  <p>Then rewrite the URL to look like `<a href="http://www.example.com/fixtures/arsenal-vs-chelsea" rel="nofollow">http://www.example.com/fixtures/arsenal-vs-chelsea</a>.  </p>  <p>There are many questions about rewrite rules on SO, but none discuss adding a small portion of text between variables. How could I make it so that I could add the <code>vs</code> portion of the URL using a rewrite rule?</p>
