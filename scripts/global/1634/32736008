<p>I'm trying to achieve the following in Nginx:</p>  <p>Let's say I have a specific URL with an argument:</p>  <p><a href="http://domain/location?xml" rel="nofollow">http://domain/location?xml</a></p>  <p>I want to make sure that if Nginx sees this location and this specific argument, to serve xml files from a certain folder.</p>  <p>I tried something like this, but of course, aliases are not accepted inside if statements. </p>  <pre><code>location /location {     if ($args = "xml") {         alias /opt/static_files/$1;     } } </code></pre>  <p>I know that Nginx  doesn't really recommend using the if directive inside a location context (IFisEvil), so documentation on this is scarce... Does anyone have a clue if what I want can be achieved or not?</p>
