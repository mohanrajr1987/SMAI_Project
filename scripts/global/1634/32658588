<p>is there a way to disallow to go backwards to another directory? E.g.: The URL is <a href="http://www.example.com/subdirectory/" rel="nofollow">http://www.example.com/subdirectory/</a></p>  <p>If there is a HTML file which links to the the URL "/file.txt" it should not leave the subdirectory. The slash has to be ignored. Are there some Rewrite Rules in htaccess to do this? The subdirectory should be handled like a root directory.</p>
