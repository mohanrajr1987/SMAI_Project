<p>I have a custom post type <code>resource</code>. This custom post type shares the <code>category</code> taxonomy with posts.</p>  <p>For a given category term archive, example url: <code>/category/reducing-inequality/</code>, I want to have an additional URL that displays ONLY the resource custom post type for that category. I can do so by using a query string:</p>  <p><code>category/reducing-inequality/?post_type=resource</code></p>  <p>What I want to do though is create a rewrite rule that will have this category archive (the above URL) instead rewrite to <code>/resource/category/reducing-inequality</code></p>  <p>Is this possible? Any guidance is much appreciated, thank you!</p>
