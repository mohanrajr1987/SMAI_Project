<p>I'd like to use SEO friendly URLs on my website so I wrote the following code to my .htaccess file:</p>  <pre><code># url rewrite query string removal.... RewriteEngine On RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d RewriteRule ^([^/]+)/?$ index.php?pagina=$1 # url rewrite query string removal.... </code></pre>  <p>OR the code below (NOT used at the same moment and both seems to do the same for me) </p>  <pre><code># url rewrite query string removal.. RewriteEngine On RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d RewriteRule ^([^/\.]+)/?$ index.php?pagina=$1 # TEST  # url rewrite query string removal.. </code></pre>  <p>Both work just fine for all pages except 1 page. My homepage is not working if I try to visit domain for example www.example.com is not working but www.example.com/home is working.</p>  <p>My question is: How can I have SEO friendly homepage if:</p>  <p>The original url is <a href="http://www.example.com/index.php?pagina=home" rel="nofollow">http://www.example.com/index.php?pagina=home</a> AND if I use the .htaccess code it will be <a href="http://www.example.com/home" rel="nofollow">http://www.example.com/home</a> but as I do not like www.example.com/home as my homepage, I'd like to rewrite the homepage to www.example.com and all others should be at www.example.com/filename where filename can be any of the file names that can be found in the /pagina/ folder.</p>  <p>How to set homepage to www.example.com instead of www.example.com/home without any errors and what .htaccess code is best for me?</p>
