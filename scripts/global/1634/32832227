<p><strong>Here's my problem:</strong> Whenever I create a categorized article in Joomla, the URL that SEF creates for it always has a number inserted before the alias I gave it. </p>  <p>The number <em>seems</em> to be associated with the number of articles that have been created on my Joomla website.</p>  <p>Take the following example:</p>  <p>I create an article: "Tomorrow's Meeting at the Library!"</p>  <p>I categorize it under news, and it shows up on my Joomla website.</p>  <p>Clicking on the link sends you to "domain.com/<strong>23</strong>-tomorrows-meeeting-at-the-library" <em>instead of</em> "domain.com/tomorrows-meeeting-at-the-library"</p>  <p>How can I fix this? Does it require a custom modification to the SEF plugin?</p>
