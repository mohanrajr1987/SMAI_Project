<p>I'm currently trying to integrate <a href="http://mun.ee/" rel="nofollow">Munee</a> in an existing <a href="http://www.slimframework.com/docs/" rel="nofollow">Slim 3</a> application.</p>  <p>The Problem is that Slim does the Routing in the app and needs nginx to redirect all non-existing files to index.php to do so.</p>  <p>Munee, on the other hand, needs a redirect for some file extensions to be able to cache/minify/etc. them.</p>  <p>I tried for about 4 Hours now, read through everything on SO and Google and didn't find a working solution.</p>  <p>Things I've tried:</p>  <p>1.</p>  <pre><code>location ~ \.(css|less|scss|js|coffee|jpg|png|gif|jpeg) {     rewrite ^/(.*)$ /munee.php?files=/$1 break; } try_files $uri /index.php; </code></pre>  <p>2.</p>  <pre><code>rewrite ^/(.*\.(?:css|less|scss|js|coffee|jpg|png|gif|jpeg))$ /munee.php?files=/$1 break;  try_files $uri /index.php; </code></pre>  <p>3.</p>  <pre><code>location ~ \.(css|less|scss|js|coffee|jpg|png|gif|jpeg) {     if (-f $request_filename) {         rewrite ^(.*) /munee.php?files=/$1 last;     } } try_files $uri /index.php; </code></pre>  <p>Also, I tried to redirect all traffic to index.php to be able to process everything in PHP, but if the file existed, it was still just presented directly.</p>  <p>If someone has an alternative to Munee, it would greatly appreciate it, but I think it does exactly what I need and nothing more... Assetic just seems so overloaded and unnecessary complicated.</p>  <p>EDIT (as requested):</p>  <p>At the end of the nginx config, there is this section:</p>  <pre><code>location /index.php {        fastcgi_connect_timeout 3s;     # default of 60s is just too long        fastcgi_read_timeout 10s;       # default of 60s is just too long        include fastcgi_params;        fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;    # assumes you are running php-fpm      locally on port 9000    } </code></pre>
