<p>Is there a way to redirect:</p>  <p><a href="https://www.domain.com" rel="nofollow">https://www.domain.com</a></p>  <p>To:</p>  <p><a href="https://domain.com" rel="nofollow">https://domain.com</a></p>  <p>I have tried some solutions offered but they only work if the user enters www.doamin.com in the address field, as soon as they enter <a href="https://www.domain.com" rel="nofollow">https://www.domain.com</a> it does not work. I get a "Your connection is not private" error message in Chrome and the https is crossed out because our SSL is registered for domain.com NOT www.domain.com.</p>  <p>I've tried the following in the htaccess but it doesn't work if a user enters <a href="https://www.domain.com" rel="nofollow">https://www.domain.com</a> only if they enter www.domain.com:</p>  <pre><code># Remove www from the URL. RewriteEngine on RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www\.(.*)$ [NC] RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://%1%{REQUEST_URI} [R=301,QSA,NC,L] </code></pre>  <p>I've also tried the following in my virtual host entry, but the result is the same as the above:</p>  <pre><code>Redirect permanent / https://domain.com/ </code></pre>  <p>Thanks for any help.</p>
