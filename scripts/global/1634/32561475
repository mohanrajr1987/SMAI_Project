<p>I got stuck with the following problem. I want to extract last string before slash limited by dash as a variable name and last integer before that slash also limited by dash as a value of this variable.</p>  <p>In other words I want to rewrite this imaginary url</p>  <p><a href="http://www.example.com/en/golden-watch-omega-ser-3-712-p/" rel="nofollow">http://www.example.com/en/golden-watch-omega-ser-3-712-p/</a></p>  <p>to</p>  <p><a href="http://www.example.com/index.php?lang=en&amp;p=712" rel="nofollow">http://www.example.com/index.php?lang=en&amp;p=712</a></p>  <p>The string is dynamic, therefore there could be "x" instead of "p", or any other letter.</p>  <p>Is that even possible? I'll be grateful for any help.</p>
