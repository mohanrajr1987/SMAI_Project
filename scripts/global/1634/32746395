<p>I am building simple php mvc application, but have problem with .htaccess, it looks like it is ignoring flags and doesn't want to run next line</p>  <pre><code>Options -MultiViews Options +FollowSymLinks RewriteEngine On  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-l   RewriteRule ^(en|sk)(\/)(.+)$ index.php?url=$3&amp;lang=$1 [C] RewriteRule ^(.+)$ index.php?url=$1 [C] </code></pre>  <p>my goal is to have multilingual site with adresses like <a href="http://example.com/lang/something" rel="nofollow">http://example.com/lang/something</a>, I used this as mvc skeleton <a href="https://github.com/panique/mini" rel="nofollow">link to github repo</a> but it misbehaves</p>  <p>when going to <code>http://127.0.0.10</code>, everything ok when going to <code>http://127.0.0.10/en/home</code> page also works when going to <code>http://127.0.0.10/home</code> page not works</p>  <p>then when I removed first rule or swapped rules order, going to <code>http://127.0.0.10/home</code> started to work, but when going to <code>http://127.0.0.10/en/home</code> not, I undestand in first case here error was in place because app thinks "en" is controller, but what in second case ?</p>
