<p>I've been trying for at least 4 hours to fix this problem on my own and have scoured through several hundreds of Stack Overflow pages and other forums in search of a solution, but I can't seem to solve this simple problem.</p>  <p>The contents are arranged as follows:</p>  <pre><code>-- index.php   -- js        - script.js   -- css        - style.css   -- images        - image.png </code></pre>  <p>In the website, I need<code>index.php?dept=foo</code> to be rewritten as <code>dept/foo</code>. This works with the following RewriteRule:</p>  <pre><code>RewriteRule ^dept/(\w+)/?$ index.php?dept=$1 [NC] </code></pre>  <p>But then the CSS, JS and images won't load any more.</p>  <p>The CSS and JS files are currently are currently included as follows:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css" /&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I tried changing the URLs to have absolute paths (i.e. <code>/css/style.css</code> too`, but that didn't fix it either).</p>  <p>How can I correctly fix the problem?</p>
