<p>I'd like to make a rewrite rule that only operates if a specific term is found in the url.</p>  <p>So if the <code>targetterm</code> is <strong>target</strong> and the url is:<br> <code>website.com/target/something/test/</code>  </p>  <p>I want it to become:<br> <code>website.com/target/something/test/#anchor</code></p>  <p>But if the url is, for instance:<br> <code>website.com/alternative/something/test/</code><br> I want nothing to happen.  </p>  <p>Is there maybe someone who has a clou?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
