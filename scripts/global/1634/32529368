<p>My client wants to have his uploads without prefix on his website</p>  <pre><code>http://example.com/upload.txt </code></pre>  <p>And of course we have a public folder with a lot of things in it such as</p>  <pre><code>http://example.com/assets/styles.css </code></pre>  <p>What we do here on the backend is that we store the uploads in <strong>/uploads</strong> and the public files in <strong>/public</strong>, while we have an <strong>index.php</strong> file on the root.</p>  <p>Can you tell me a working solution to do what we can already do in Nginx?</p>  <pre><code>try_files /public/$uri /uploads/$uri /index.php?$query_string; </code></pre>
