<p>I have a site where the permalinks are already setup and working fine in the format <a href="http://(domain)/post-name" rel="nofollow">http://(domain)/post-name</a>, I want to move them to <a href="http://(domain)/blog/post-name" rel="nofollow">http://(domain)/blog/post-name</a>. Everything is done in the IIS rewrite module. I am assuming I need to first make a redirect rule from <a href="http://(domain)/post-name" rel="nofollow">http://(domain)/post-name</a> to <a href="http://(domain)/blog/post-name" rel="nofollow">http://(domain)/blog/post-name</a> and then tweak the permalink rewrite rule to make it work with the new <a href="http://(domain)/blog/post-name" rel="nofollow">http://(domain)/blog/post-name</a> format (although I am not sure if that is needed if I update the permalink settings in wordpress to a custom format that has the blog/ in the path). The first problem I am having is that the redirect is not working correctly, it redirects but doesn't put the blog/ in front of the post-name like I am expecting. Here are the rules in the web.config</p>  <pre><code>        &lt;rule name="wordpress" stopProcessing="true"&gt;             &lt;match url="^blog\/" negate="true" /&gt;                 &lt;conditions&gt;                     &lt;add input="{REQUEST_FILENAME}" matchType="IsFile" negate="true"/&gt;                     &lt;add input="{REQUEST_FILENAME}" matchType="IsDirectory" negate="true"/&gt;                 &lt;/conditions&gt;             &lt;action type="Redirect" url="/blog/{R:1}" redirectType="Permanent" /&gt;         &lt;/rule&gt;         &lt;rule name="wordpress2" patternSyntax="Wildcard"&gt;             &lt;match url="*"/&gt;                 &lt;conditions&gt;                     &lt;add input="{REQUEST_FILENAME}" matchType="IsFile" negate="true"/&gt;                     &lt;add input="{REQUEST_FILENAME}" matchType="IsDirectory" negate="true"/&gt;                 &lt;/conditions&gt;             &lt;action type="Rewrite" url="index.php"/&gt;         &lt;/rule&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Also, if I need to tweak the second rule I am not sure what needs to change to make it continue to work or if I just need to update the permalink settings in wordpress. I am fairly new to wordpress and my knowledge of the rewrite module is enough to be dangerous. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I have been looking for an example of this, but have had a difficult time finding one. Thanks in advance.</p>
