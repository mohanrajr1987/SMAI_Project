<p>I need to redirect /forum and /forums to a new folder called /new.  This is to catch variations of the name/type-o, it isn't to be used as an alias directive.</p>  <p>I need like this:</p>  <pre><code>/forum to /new /forum/ to /new/ /forums to /new /forums/ to /new/ /forum/blah to /new/blah /forum/wee/blah.jpg to /new/wee/blah.jpg </code></pre>  <p>I'm pulling my hair out, I know it's simple but I've tried a dozen examples and can't get it.</p>  <p>Using:</p>  <pre><code>location /forum {     return 301 $scheme://$host/new; } </code></pre>  <p>Only works for exactly /forum, it doesn't work for /forum/blah for example (needs to go to /new/blah).</p>  <pre><code>02:22 AM [atlantis]/etc/nginx/sites root # curl -I xxx/forum HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently Server: nginx Date: Sat, 12 Sep 2015 06:22:06 GMT Content-Type: text/html Content-Length: 178 Connection: keep-alive Location: http://xxx/new Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000 X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff  02:22 AM [atlantis]/etc/nginx/sites root # curl -I xxx/forum/blah HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently Server: nginx Date: Sat, 12 Sep 2015 06:22:12 GMT Content-Type: text/html Content-Length: 178 Connection: keep-alive Location: http://xxx/new Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000 X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff </code></pre>
