<p>I'm having issues with Modernizr throwing an 'Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token &lt;'</p>  <p>When I click the error in Chrome dev tools it reports the error as being on the first line at . </p>  <p>After some debugging I think I've narrowed the issue down weirdly to htaccess rewrites I have going on. </p>  <p>Here's what I have in my htaccess:</p>  <pre><code>Options +FollowSymLinks RewriteEngine On RewriteCond %{SCRIPT_FILENAME} !-d RewriteCond %{SCRIPT_FILENAME} !-f RewriteRule ^faqs/ ./faqs.php </code></pre>  <p>If I visit /faqs/I get the error. If I visit just /faqs.php there is no error. That's how I'm coming to the conclusion that the issue lies in this rewrite. </p>  <p>Has anyone seen anything like this before? Any ideas on a fix?</p>  <p>Cheers</p>
