<p>What is the best practice of rewriting URL from one directory to another. Actualy this is my folder structure.</p>  <pre><code>/     /folder1         /subfolder1             index.php         /subfolder2             index.php             ...     /folder2         /subfolder1             index.php         /subfolder2             index.php             ...     /folder3         index.php         /images         /css         /...             /...         ... </code></pre>  <p>What I want to achieve is that only requests to <code>http://example.com/folderX/subfolder1/*</code> rewrites to <code>index.php</code> in <code>folder3</code></p>  <p>I don't want to rewrite anything from subfolder2 and I need everything from subfolder1 rewrited.</p>  <p>So far I have this. Is it good solution or there is a better way?</p>  <pre><code>&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;     RewriteEngine on     RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f     RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} (.*?)/subfolder1$     RewriteRule ^([^?]*)$ folder3/index.php?path=$1 [NC,L,QSA] &lt;/IfModule&gt; </code></pre>
