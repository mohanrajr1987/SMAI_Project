<p>i need to figure out how i can execute the index.php on webspace root.</p>  <p>I have this: </p>  <pre><code>RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !=/favicon.ico RewriteRule ^ /index.php [L] </code></pre>  <p>Now i have a folder root/some/projects In projects are some php logics.</p>  <p>I wana browse to www.domain.de/some and i get a Error: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Forbidden</p>      <p>You don't have permission to access /some/ on this server.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Because in root/some is no php logic in. So i want that he executes the root/index.php coz there is a cms with the right content for www.domain.de/some and not the root/some/index.php</p>  <p>anyone have a solution?</p>  <p>Thx</p>
