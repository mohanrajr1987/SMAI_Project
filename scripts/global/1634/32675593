<p>I have posts of the category <strong>hiring</strong> and I need to assign a parent page <strong>about</strong> to posts from the category, so that the permalink structure can be changed from</p>  <pre><code>www.mysite.com/hiring-post </code></pre>  <p>to</p>  <pre><code>www.mysite.com/about/hiring-post </code></pre>  <p>I do not want to set a parent page for all my posts under the Permalinks settings, but just for posts that belong to the <strong>hiring</strong> category.</p>  <p>My Wordpress permalinks structure is by post name, and <strong>about</strong> is a page, if that helps. I do not want to create a custom post type either.</p>
