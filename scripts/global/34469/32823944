<p>Since Visual Studio 2010 the option to specify C++ project dependencies in the solution is deprecated (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7683869/what-does-the-link-library-dependency-linker-option-actually-do-in-visual-stud">What does the “Link Library Dependency” linker option actually do in Visual Studio 2010?</a>).</p>  <p>However hard-linking a library dependency in the project file is not always convenient. I would like to keep the dependency interchangeable.</p>  <p>For example I have a project defining unittests for a set of libraries. I want to execute the unittests for different versions of the library (each defined in its own vcxproj). Pre-VS-2010 one solution file could be created for each library dependency, requiring only a single project file for the unittests. Now the "preferred" way to do it would be to duplicate the unittest project files for each library dependency, which is undesired.</p>  <p>The .lib output of the dependency could be manually added to the "Additional Dependencies" in the linker options, but this feels like a hack.</p>  <p>What is the best practice for modeling these kind of dependencies in Visual Studio 2015?</p>
