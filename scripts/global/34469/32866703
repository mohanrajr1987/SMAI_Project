<p>I'm building a C++/MFC desktop app that shares a lot of data with an USB device. Because of how this devices works I need to close and open the virtual COM I use, severl times per minute.</p>  <p>Everything works well, but I would like to stop the annoying Windows USB connected/disconnected suound, that comes up every time I connect or disconnect the device.</p>  <p>So my question is: is there a way to disable/enable Windows event sounds (or a single event sound, even better) through my C++ code? Obviously I could somehow turn down the volume, but that's not what I want, since it would stop sounds from every other app. Is there a way to do something like this?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
