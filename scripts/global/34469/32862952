<p>I need to make a <strong>Setup launcher application on windows</strong>. It's GUI is needed to be very good looking. It should work on <strong>native</strong> windows, without need of installing any framework. Could some one please advise me which language should I use so that I can make it, beautifying the GUI is a major factor which needs to be considered. I am currently considering C++ / Visual C++ / C#..</p>
