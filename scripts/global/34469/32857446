<p>I don't know if the title makes any sense to you guys and i'm not very good with English so i'll explain my problem through images (i don't have enough rep so sorry about that)</p>  <p>So in my solution I have 2 projects:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/6ETzA.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/6ETzA.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>What i'm trying to do is to 'show' my second one through the first, like this:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ppeMq.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ppeMq.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I sound like a total noob... but is this possible? if it is, how can i achieve this?</p>  <p>Both are written in C++</p>  <p>Thank you for your help.</p>
