<p>I am using a fast line chart control to plot more 19000 points. </p>  <p>I've found then when I zoom in on the chart control and the starting index of the zoom range is an odd number, that the x-axis labels disappear. </p>  <p>I've managed to fix the issue by setting the starting index of the range to an even number on an onZoom event but this seems like a bit of an ugly fix. </p>  <p>Has anyone out there witnessed this behaviour or know of a more elegant fix? </p>
