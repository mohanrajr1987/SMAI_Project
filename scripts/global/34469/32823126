<p>I am new to Cryengine and I am trying to build custom <code>Game DLL</code> for my game. But first, I tried to compile <code>CryGameZero DLL</code> and I came up with some compilation errors.</p>  <p>I am using <strong>VS2013 Professional</strong>.</p>  <pre><code>Error RC1015: cannot open include file 'winres.h'.     c:\...\CRYENGINE\BinTemp\rc_files\CryGameZero.auto_gen.rc      10 1 CryGameZero  Error MSB3073: The command "cd /d     "c:\...\CRYENGINE" &amp; cry_waf.exe      build_win_x86_profile --project-spec gamezero     --execsolution="c:\...\CRYENGINE\Solutions\CRYENGINE.sln"     --targets=CryGameZero" exited with code 1.     c:\...\CRYENGINE\_WAF_\msbuild\waf_build.targets     69 3 CryGameZero </code></pre>  <p>I checked in my <strong>VC++ Directories</strong> and I had <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.0\include\um</code> but <code>winres.h</code> was not in that directory so I changed to <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.1\Include\um</code> where is <code>winres.h</code> located but I still get the same error.</p>  <p>Does anybody had the same problem or know how to fix this. I was searching on Google but so far I found documentation and tutorials on doing this with older versions of Cryengine without WAF and using VS2010 or VS2012.</p>
