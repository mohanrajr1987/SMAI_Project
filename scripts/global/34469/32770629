<p>I have written a piece of code where it does visualization for a particular ray tracing process. I have used VC++ 2012 and OpenGL for it. I now require it to plot a very simple graph by giving x and y as inputs.  I was wondering if there was an external library I could use to do this. I don't mind if it comes in a separate window or not.  I did a bit of searching and found the following could be used. However I didn't have a good chance of using it successfully.</p>  <ol> <li>koolplot</li> <li>GNUplot</li> <li>MS Chart</li> </ol>  <p>Can anyone tell me a relatively simple way to go about this.</p>
