I have created and deleted it in the past. Actually this configuration set is not visible in configuration manager.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/AEBjn.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/AEBjn.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>But why it appears in property page? And how to remove it?</p>
