<p>When I open Qtcreator I get the following error message (from a notification box): "The following plugins have errors and cannot be loaded" with the list of the plugins containing errors: CMakeProjectManager, Qnx, RemoteLinux and Valgrind. When I click over the name of a plugin I obtain some details like that</p>  <pre><code>Could not resolve dependency 'AnalyzerBase(3.1.1)' Could not resolve dependency 'Core(3.1.1)' Could not resolve dependency 'ProjectExplorer(3.1.1)' Could not resolve dependency 'TextEditor(3.1.1)' </code></pre>  <p>I use Linux (ubuntu 14.04) and I have no idea what to do.</p>
