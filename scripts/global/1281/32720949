<p>I was wondering whether or not it is possible to tell NetBeans (I am running NetBeans 8.0.2) to build a project (let's call that "Project A") that is a dependency of another project (let's call that "Project B") whenever the second project is run.</p>  <p>I'll try to explain:</p>  <p>Project A is a library. Project B is a simple test application for said library. Ergo, once I change anything in the library (A), I need to build it before I can run/debug the test application (B). Oh, both projects are usign Maven (but I'd prefer a solution that does <strong>not</strong> involve Maven).</p>  <p>From time to time it simply happens: I forget that I have to build the library and wonder why my changes won't work (well, of course they won't, the library's changes have not yet been built).</p>  <p><strong>So my question is:</strong> how can I tell NetBeans (I'd prefer not to use Maven for this) to always build the library when I run or debug the test application?</p>  <p>Hope you guys can find me an answer to this question, it's driving me crazy!</p>  <p>Thanks in advance, feel free to ask if I did not make everything clear.</p>
