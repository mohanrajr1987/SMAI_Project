<p>I've been trying to add an Xcode project (a static library) as a dependency to another project (a framework). I've read about this issue, but I can't find what I'm looking for. Specifically, what I find is a way to add the static library <strong>binary</strong> as a dependency (in target dependencies), but this is not what I want. Instead, I have two projects configured in the same workspace. Similar to this:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/IxIs2.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/IxIs2.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>(<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9726000/xcode-4-2-and-using-a-static-library-causing-problems?answertab=votes#tab-top">Image credits</a>)</p>  <p>What I want is for the <code>MyLib</code> project to <strong>build</strong> when <code>MyApp</code> builds, if needed. I'm not just interested in adding the static library for linking. Is this possible?</p>  <p>Edit: I'm currently exploring the possibility of doing this using a <code>Run Script</code>. If possible I'd like a better alternative, though</p>
