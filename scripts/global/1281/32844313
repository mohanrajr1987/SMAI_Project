<p>Attached excel for your reference.</p>  <p>Sheet Receipts UF has Item Pick-list &amp; Model Pick-list in which Model Pick-list is a dependent pick-list &amp; I even required Search Suggestion for this drop-down list as this list will keep on increasing</p>  <p>So please help me in adding this search suggestion with formulas to this dependent Drop-down list.</p>  <p>Ex: As of now, it works like when I select Down-Rod in Item Pick-list, I get only concerned list in the Model Pick-list. Whereas I want to add one more functionality for this drop-down list i.e., When I start typing the words in the model pick-list, whatever the model has these words should appear in the drop-down list</p>  <p>Another request is that I need this to happen only with formulas, as I'm not much familiar with VBA</p>  <p>I've already posted this in Excelforum, below link for your reference.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.excelforum.com/excel-formulas-and-functions/1106495-multi-functionality-for-data-validation-list-dependent-and-search-suggestion-for-a-picklis.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.excelforum.com/excel-formulas-and-functions/1106495-multi-functionality-for-data-validation-list-dependent-and-search-suggestion-for-a-picklis.html</a></p>
