<p>In my Android Studio project, I have an Android module <em>app</em>, and two library projects <em>lib1</em> and <em>lib2</em>. </p>  <p>All these 3 modules require the same file dependency: android-support-v4.jar. </p>  <p>When I only put this jar in <em>app</em>, <em>lib1</em> will report an error that "package android.support.v4.view doesn't exist", meaning it didn't find android-support-v4.jar. When I put this jar all the 3 modules, proguard will report an error of duplicate classes found. So how can I let multiple modules referring to the same jar library? Thanks!</p>  <p>Note that I've got to use jar file instead of remote library in maven repository, since another developer is using eclipse on this project.</p>
