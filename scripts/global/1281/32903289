<p>I'm a C# programmer turning my hand to a C++ project in VS 2008. I have the source of a program delivered by an outside company for which I wish to make a DLL providing some of the functionality to be used by a C# program we build around it.</p>  <p>I have a C++ project which contains all of the code for the external company's program. All of the functionality I want is implemented in a single header file (of about 15) but when I <code>#include</code> that in a separate project, I get a <strong>lot</strong> of compiler syntax errors from libraries and header files included as part of other header files or one of the two .cpp files. </p>  <p>I've tried going through and just including everything wantonly from the original project just to get it to build but I still get (fewer) syntax errors. The original project builds just fine. </p>  <p>I'm unaccustomed to dealing with this sort of situation and I don't have the vocabulary to describe my problem well enough for Google to help. Are there any tools or techniques used by C++ programmers to work through the web of dependencies like this in order to transplant the required dependencies from one project to another?</p>  <p>Edit:</p>  <p>An example of the specific problems I'm seeing include </p>  <pre><code>error C2143: syntax error : missing ';' before '&lt;' </code></pre>  <p>on the second of these two lines</p>  <pre><code>static int V_LB_NO; static vector&lt;int&gt; V_LB_NO_LIST; </code></pre>  <p>which is solved by adding  <code>#include &lt;vector&gt;</code>.</p>  <p>Another specific example is </p>  <pre><code>error C2065: 'Dialogue' : undeclared identifier </code></pre>  <p>on the line</p>  <pre><code>Dialogue MA_Dialogue(MF_path); </code></pre>  <p>which is solved by adding <code>#include "..\database\Dialogue.h"</code> which implements the Dialogue class. This leaves me with another 183 errors which I believe would be solved by also <code>#include</code> ing the correct header files.</p>  <p>I'm not asking for help with a specific dependency or compiler error, I'm asking if there are any programming techniques I may be unaware of which will help me identify what header and library dependencies a project has, so that I can then <code>#include</code> the required files in another project.</p>  <p>What techniques do C++ programmers use to unravel dependency issues which I might not be aware of as someone more accustomed to C#?</p>
