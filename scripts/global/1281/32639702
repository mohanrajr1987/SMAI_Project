<p>I am writing an application in NodeJS, which calls some python scripts that are stored within the application. The program uses some NodeJS packages that I have installed using <code>npm --save</code>, so users don't have to install it.</p>  <p>However, there are a few python dependencies needed, which I installed using <code>pip install</code>. Is there a way to pack these dependencies within the app as npm does for me?</p>
