<p>What is the best way to tackle the following use case with a package only application structure in meteor?</p>  <p>People should be able to use a search box that searches different types of media like pictures or articles. The search package itself should be extendable because more media types can be added later on.</p>  <p>First I created a package 'app:search', 'app:article' and 'app:picture'. Is this really the best way to go? Furthermore I am not sure how to handle the dependencies between the packages in general. Does app:search depend on app:article or is it the other way around?</p>  <p>Best case would be to be able to develop each package by its own in a clean enviroment. But if I try to implement the packages they become dependent soon. What is the best way to go in general to handle this problem?</p>
