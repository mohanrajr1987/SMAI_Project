<p>I want to build my app while flashing custom ROM on the device. I'm trying to find proper way to include project dependencies in the Android.mk. My dependencies look like this:</p>  <pre><code>dependencies {   compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])   wearApp project(':wear')   compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:22.2.0'   compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services:6.5.87'   compile 'com.android.support:design:22.2.0'   compile 'com.android.support:cardview-v7:21.0.+'   compile 'com.timehop.stickyheadersrecyclerview:library:0.4.2@aar'  </code></pre>  <p>How to put it into the makefile? As static libraries? Or maybe as extra packages? Waiting for your help!</p>
