<p>I'm very new to Maven, in fact I installed it and tried to compile my first pom file with a few dependencies just mere hours ago.</p>  <p>I'm trying to built a rest web service in Java that communicates with Eucalyptus and OpenStack, using amazonaws and openstack4j respectively. However, I've run into some problems compiling these two together, seeing as they are dependent on many other jars as well, version specific and so on.</p>  <p>I tried adding the dependency for openstack4j and amazonaws (I assume I need to add the one for jersey as well), but when it gets compiled, the downloaded jars were stored in the repository folder for maven. Do I need to go collect each and every one of them by hand so I can add them to my Eclipse project as an External jar?</p>  <p>Could anyone point me in the right direction?</p>
