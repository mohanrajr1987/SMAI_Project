<p>I'm looking for a way to share configuration (dependencies for example) accross projects (but not subprojects).</p>  <p>I was wondering if it was possible to centralize dependencies in some sbt project and get those from several other sbt projects.</p>  <p>If there is no simple way, should I consider developping a plugin to expose those dependencies?</p>  <p>Thanks a lot.</p>  <p>Christophe</p>
