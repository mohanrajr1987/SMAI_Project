<p>I have been messing around with py2exe and I was able to self contain everything into a single executable. However, after all of the required libraries are imported, and the executable is made. The program ends up being around 20 MB! My program only represents about 2MB of that. </p>  <p>Although this isn't terrible, I'd like it smaller if possible. If I were to do regular updates, I wouldn't want a dozen people to keep having to download 20 MB of data for every little change, especially if a lot of that data is just python dependencies that won't change.</p>  <p>Is there any way with py2exe to have it so all of <em>my program</em> files are in the EXE and then the library.zip file just includes all of the dependencies? Or maybe two zip files, one for my program, and one for the python dependencies?</p>  <p>For example:</p>  <pre><code>  setup(windows=[fileInfo],    options={'py2exe': {                        'bundle_files': 2,                        'optimize': 2,                      },   },   zipfile="library.zip",    } </code></pre>  <p>Thanks for any help.</p>
