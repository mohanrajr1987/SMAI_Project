<p>I have a problem with projects that depend on NuGet packages that they do not consume, or indirectly require dependencies, here is the project structure:</p>  <pre><code>- Data        -&gt; Depends on Entity Framework - Business - UI </code></pre>  <p>The problem here is that because <code>Data</code> has a dependency to <strong>Entity Framework</strong>, this means that the <code>Business</code> layer and also the <code>UI</code> must also install this in their projects.</p>  <p>How can I separate these dependencies so that only the <code>Data</code> layer requires Entity Framework?</p>
