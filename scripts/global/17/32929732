<p>I am fairly new to Java and I need to make a linked list. I was told that I need to make a class called "Node" to store each element. I've written the class:</p>  <pre><code>public class Node() {     public T data;     public Node next;      public Node(T data, Node next)     {         this.data = data;         this.next = next;     }      public Node getNext()     {         return next;     }     public T getData()     {         return data;     } } </code></pre>  <p>However, I am not allowed to make a separate class, it has to be within the LinkedList class. I understand how to make an inner class of something like an imported iterator, but the "Node" is not imported. How would I do this?</p>
