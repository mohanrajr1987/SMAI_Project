<p>As I'm learning about Fragments and Android coding in general, I was wondering why the official documentation suggests using XML for Fragments in the first place? When you know for a fact that your Fragment won't be removed or modified at runtime, XML is fine. However, what's the point of getting into that practice if, and I'm quoting the <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/basics/fragments/index.html" rel="nofollow">Intro to Fragments Documentation</a> here:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>"To create a dynamic and multi-pane user interface on Android"</p> </blockquote>  <p>What is the point of ever using XML over building one programatically? Should I spend time learning a static way to build a component that's meant to make your app more dynamic?</p>  <p>Thank you for any insight!</p>
