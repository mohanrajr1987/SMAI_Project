<p>I am modifying normal word count program which counts every word to make it count only specific words. The reducer and map class are same as of normal word count.</p>  <pre><code>public class wordcountmapper extends MapReduceBase implements Mapper&lt;LongWritable, Tex, Text, IntWritable&gt;                       // mapper function implemented.         {         private final static IntWritable one= new IntWritable(1); // intwritable         private Text word= new Text();            public void map(LongWritable key,Text value,OutputCollector&lt;Text, IntWritable&gt; output, Reporter reporter) throws IOException         {         String line = value.toString();      // conversion in string         StringTokenizer tokenizer= new StringTokenizer(line);         while(tokenizer.hasMoreTokens())         {         word.set(tokenizer.nextToken());         if(line.compareTo("Cold")==0){  //cold is the specific word to get count for         output.collect(word,one);      // getting 1 as a count for 'cold' as if its counting only first line 'cold' and not going to next line.         }         }         } </code></pre>
