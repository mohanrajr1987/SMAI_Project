<p>I need help with this assignment:</p>  <hr>  <p>Write a program that can input from a set of superkeys , and output all possible candidate keys from the input to an output file (named "candidate-keys").</p>  <p>The superkeys of one example look as follows: ABCF CDF ACDF BCDF ABCDF ABCEF CDEF ACDEF BCDEF ABCDEF</p>  <p>The output that contains all possible candidate keys: ABCF CDF</p>  <p>You need to create several sets of inputs that contain superkeys, which you make them up yourself.  You, then, run your program against those input files.  You need to examine your outputs and make sure they are correct.</p>  <hr>  <p>In the example above, I don't understand how to get all possible candidate keys from that set of superkeys. Can you help me out and explain?</p>
