<p>Using the default REST implementation (Jersey: <code>com.sun.jersey.spi.spring.container.servlet.SpringServlet</code>) along with Spring running inside Jetty, a data source problem emerged.</p>  <p>A custom data source manager based on Hikari is used and the JdbcTemplate is fetched directly from the manager bypassing Jetty and Jersey. This leaves the transaction management entirely to the application and the developer. Since this is an unnecessary burden and an unnecessary  source of various hard to spot defects, it would be nice to hand over the transactional integration to the container (Jetty/Jersey) and Spring.</p>  <p>What would be the best configuration option available?</p>
