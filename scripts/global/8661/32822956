<p>I have a rest webservice using oAuth2 for authentication. I have an android app where we call the webservice to sync data. Also , we have a login on the android where it authenticates with the webservice before sync data. Now I have web application using spring 3. Currently I have a simple using spring security. Now I want to change this part, that is on login it authenticates with the webservice using oAuth2. Is it possible? If so, any example available? What are the modification that I need to do? </p>
