<p>I want to bring Object from the MongoDB with the help of two Ids of Different Domains.The object would be such that it is the combination of these 2 Ids. If either of them is not found, It must not send any data to me.</p>  <p>What I am trying is as follows </p>  <pre><code>public List&lt;user&gt; findByProjectIdAndId(String projectId , String Id); </code></pre>  <p>Now, there are two domains one is   <strong>Project</strong> and another is <strong>User</strong> if combiantion of ProjectId and UserId is found in Mongo Database Then it should return me an object Of User else not.</p>  <p>Suppose I want to search like this is my browser</p>  <blockquote>   <p><a href="http://localhost:8080/v1/users/55ee9c601d2ab82ee145ca77?projectId=55e3d548a77f6557ebf47e28" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8080/v1/users/55ee9c601d2ab82ee145ca77?projectId=55e3d548a77f6557ebf47e28</a></p> </blockquote>  <p>My Json should be like this : </p>  <pre><code>{  id: "55ee9c601d2ab82ee145ca77",  createdBy: "55e3d548a77f6557ebf47e13",  modifiedBy: "55e3d548a77f6557ebf47e13",  startDate: "2015-09-01T12:55:43.511Z",  endDate: "2015-10-09T12:55:43.511Z",  projectId: "55e3d548a77f6557ebf47e28",  numberofAssigned: 0,  numberofCompleted: 0,  completionPercentage: 0 </code></pre>  <p>}</p>  <p>What should I follow to achieve this. Thanks in advance.</p>
