<p>I've searched for hours on this and haven't quite got it right. </p>  <p>An API on a project I'm working on is not versioned (<code>/controller/blah</code>), so we want to introduce versioning. For example, we have a class with <code>@Path("/controller")</code> associated to it. Naturally to avoid API breakage, this now has to support either <code>/</code> or <code>/v1/</code>, so the following would be valid:</p>  <pre><code>/controller/blah /v1/controller/blah </code></pre>  <p>I feel there must be an easy solution to this that I am missing?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
