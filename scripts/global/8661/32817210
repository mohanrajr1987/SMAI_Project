<p>We were testing a REST webservice developed in jersey through postman rest client. It is a POST method and is annotated with <code>@RolesAllowed</code>. The full annotation the method is as follows:</p>  <pre><code>@POST @Path("/configuration") @RolesAllowed("admin") @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON) @Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON) </code></pre>  <p>When I requested this <code>http://baseurl/configuration</code> with the expected HTTP body content, I got <code>403</code> response(it is expected since it is allowed only for admin as it seems). </p>  <p>My doubt is how to access this service with the specified role via rest client.</p>
