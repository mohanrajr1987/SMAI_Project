<p>I've managed to get jersey declarative hyperlinking working, however, I would like to have the result of this code:</p>  <pre><code>@InjectLink(resource = UserResource.class, method="getUserApplications",  bindings ={@Binding(name = "id", value = "${instance.id}")}, style =  InjectLink.Style.ABSOLUTE) private String applications; </code></pre>  <p>Be this:</p>  <pre><code>    "account": {     "applications":{ "href":"https://localhost:8080/IMREST/api/accounts/55fb111629d40123a811ad0e/applications"} } </code></pre>  <p>instead of this:</p>  <pre><code>    "account": {     "applications" : "http://localhost:8080/IMREST/api/accounts/55fb111629d40123a811ad0e/applications" } </code></pre>  <p>Does anyone have any idea how I can accomplish this?</p>  <p>I was thinking that I could possibly extend the @InjectLink interface, but I'm not sure that will work. I'm currently using JacksonFeature in Glassfish to marshall my model objects and the only customization I've seen so far with Declarative Hyperlinking has been to use Wrapper Objects.  I'd prefer to avoid that route.</p>
