<p>I have a variable <code>const char * FILENAME = "a/file/name"</code> defined in two .cpp files, called <code>a.cpp</code> and <code>b.cpp</code>.  Nothing includes these files directly, and they only include <code>a.h</code> and <code>b.h</code> respectively into themselves.  Both of those header files are then included in <code>main.cpp</code></p>  <p>My problem is that I'm getting the following linker error:</p>  <p><code>a.obj : error LNK2005: "char const * const FILENAME" (?FILENAME@@3PBDB) already defined in b.obj</code></p>  <p>I don't use file scope variables very often, so I thought this would be okay...  What am I doing wrong here?</p>
