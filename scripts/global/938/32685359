<p>I'm sorry if this is a duplicate question but I've looked through StackOverflow and Google and haven't come up with an answer yet.</p>  <p>I'm using Code::Blocks and SDL and trying to get GLEW working with openGL.</p>  <p>The program code is:</p>  <pre><code>#include &lt;Windows.h&gt; #include &lt;SDL.h&gt; #define GLEW_STATIC #include &lt;glew.h&gt;  int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {     //initialize SDL     SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO);      SDL_GL_SetAttribute(SDL_GL_CONTEXT_PROFILE_MASK, SDL_GL_CONTEXT_PROFILE_CORE);     SDL_GL_SetAttribute(SDL_GL_CONTEXT_MAJOR_VERSION, 3);     SDL_GL_SetAttribute(SDL_GL_CONTEXT_MINOR_VERSION, 2);      SDL_Window* window = SDL_CreateWindow("OpenGL", 100, 100, 800, 600, SDL_WINDOW_OPENGL);      SDL_GLContext context = SDL_GL_CreateContext(window);      glewExperimental = GL_TRUE;     glewInit();      GLuint vertexBuffer;     glGenBuffers(1, &amp;vertexBuffer);      SDL_GL_DeleteContext(context);     SDL_Quit();     return 0; } </code></pre>  <p>When I build it, it returns:</p>  <pre><code>undefined reference to 'glewExperimental' undefined reference to 'glewInit@0' undefined reference to '__glewGenBuffers' </code></pre>  <p>It's not returning an error finding glew.h, so I assume it's a problem with the linker finding the .lib files.</p>  <p>I've added the folder where the .lib files are under Project > Build Options > Search Directories > Linker and added 'glew32s', 'glew32' (I've tried switching the precedence on glew32s and glew32), and 'opengl32' under Linker Settings > Link Libraries, and added '-lglew32s', '-lglew32' (again tried switching the precedence and removing one or the other), and '-lopengl32' under Linker Settings > Other linker options.</p>  <p>I even tried adding the .lib files, .h files, and .dll files to the project folder and adding search directories to the project folder. It still returns the same error.</p>  <p>I'm using the most recent version of glew (1.13.0) on a 64-bit OS. I've tried linking to the 64-bit and 32-bit versions (because I'd read most compilers compile in 32-bit by default for compatibility). Am I linking to the wrong files?</p>  <p>Thanks for reading.</p>
