<p>I have an executable which links to a static library. The library exposes a symbol create_widget(). This symbol is not linked into the executable by clang because it is not referenced by the executable. </p>  <p>The executable links to another library which, at runtime, can reference any symbol exposed by the executable. I need to let this library see create_widget().</p>  <p>Is there a good way to resolve this? If not, i'll share the source code for create_widget() with all of the executables that need it instead of bundling it in a library.</p>
