<p>I'm trying to test a link command normally sent by msbuild to xilink.exe (intel's linker.) The command is very long so when I put it manually into command line on a Windows Server 2012 host, I get the error "The input line is too long."</p>  <p>The only workaround I've been able to find via Google is using python's subproccess/Popen commands to do it but I still get the same error.</p>  <p>What should I be doing to test this command?</p>
