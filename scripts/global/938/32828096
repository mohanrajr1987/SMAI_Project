<p>I'm trying to add <code>$ORIGIN</code> to the rpath variable of my program.</p>  <p>I added the following line to my .pro-file:</p>  <pre><code>unix: QMAKE_RPATHDIR += \$$ORIGIN </code></pre>  <p>And verified that the command is really added by checking the compilation output. The call to g++ that qmake generates looks this:</p>  <pre><code>g++ -Wl,-rpath,/home/sky/Qt/5.5/gcc_64 -Wl,-rpath,$ORIGIN -Wl... </code></pre>  <p>As you can see, origin is added (together with some other values). However, if I check the value of rpath using <code>readelf</code>, originis not listed. Instead it show an "empty" entry (just two colons) besides the entrys added by qmake:</p>  <pre><code> 0x000000000000000f (RPATH)              Bibliothek rpath: [/home/sky/Qt/5.5/gcc_64::/home/sky/Qt/5.5/gcc_64/lib] </code></pre>  <p>What am I missing here? Thanks for your help!</p>
