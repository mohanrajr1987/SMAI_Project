<p>I'm trying to compile <a href="https://github.com/arnsa/Chip-8-Emulator" rel="nofollow">this git repo</a> on my OSX. The only non-standard library it requires is SDL.</p>  <p>I've installed SDL with <code>brew install sdl</code> and compiled without errors with <code>gcc -o chip8 chip8.c -lSDL -L /usr/local/lib</code>.</p>  <p>On execution I get the following:</p>  <pre><code>users-MBP:Chip-8-Emulator user$ ./chip8 dyld: Symbol not found: __cg_jpeg_resync_to_restart   Referenced from: /System/Library/Frameworks/ImageIO.framework/Versions/A/ImageIO   Expected in: /usr/local/lib/libJPEG.dylib  in /System/Library/Frameworks/ImageIO.framework/Versions/A/ImageIO </code></pre>  <p>I appear to have everything in place though:</p>  <pre><code>$ ls /usr/local/lib ... libSDL-1.2.0.dylib libSDL.a libSDL.dylib  libSDLmain.a libjpeg.a  libjpeg.dylib libjpeg.8.dylib ... </code></pre>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>  <p>While the error in the suggested duplicate is identical, the origin of the problem is likely different and the accepted answer on that post provides no help in my case.</p>
