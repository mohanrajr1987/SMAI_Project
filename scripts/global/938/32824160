<p>I am trying to import a cmake project that I build as a Qtcreator project. The CMakelist file I created automatically download some of the libraries needed. In the making process (<code>make</code>) the terminal asks:</p>  <pre><code>replace \this\lib\archive\.DS_Store [y]es, [n]o, [A]ll, [N]one, [r]ename: make[2]:... </code></pre>  <p>The Qtcreator build is not showing me this line but it is waiting for me to answer. I know that since when I stop tre process, then it shows it in the issues prompt.</p>  <p>the answer for me can be always <code>all</code>: how set it as a default?</p>
