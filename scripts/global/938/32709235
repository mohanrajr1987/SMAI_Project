<p>I recently came across the '<a href="https://cmocka.org/" rel="nofollow">cmocka</a>' mocking library for C. I was able to mock a single function and test the caller function successfully. Now i need it to use it for a project that i am working on, where it is required to mock a large number of functions. How to pass all the functions that I want to mock to the 'wrap' argument of Linker ? Is it possible to store the names of functions in a file, so that it could be picked up the linker ?</p>
