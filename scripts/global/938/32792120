<p>I just come across this code and the blog says this works fine on 32 bit architecture. I didn't test it; however, I have a doubt about the linkage of libraries in this case.  How will the compiler link the string library to <code>main</code> since its not aware which library to link?</p>  <p>So basically if I include <code>&lt;string.h&gt;</code> then it should work fine; however, if I don't include <code>&lt;string.h&gt;</code> then, as per the blog, it runs in 32 bit architecture and fails to run on 64 bit architecture.</p>  <pre><code>#include &lt;errno.h&gt; #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;  int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {     FILE *fp;      fp = fopen(argv[1], "r");     if (fp == NULL) {         fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", strerror(errno));         return errno;     }      printf("file exist\n");      fclose(fp);      return 0; } </code></pre>
