<p>I'm trying to compile something I've fetched off of github with <code>gcc</code>:</p>  <pre><code>users-MBP:Chip-8-Emulator user$ gcc -o chip8 chip8.c Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:   "_SDL_Delay", referenced from:       _chip8_draw in chip8-bc89fc.o   "_SDL_Flip", referenced from:       _chip8_draw in chip8-bc89fc.o   "_SDL_GetKeyState", referenced from:       _chip8_execute in chip8-bc89fc.o       _chip8_prec in chip8-bc89fc.o   "_SDL_GetVideoSurface", referenced from:       _chip8_draw in chip8-bc89fc.o   "_SDL_Init", referenced from:       _chip8_prepare in chip8-bc89fc.o   "_SDL_LockSurface", referenced from:       _chip8_draw in chip8-bc89fc.o   "_SDL_PollEvent", referenced from:       _chip8_prepare in chip8-bc89fc.o       _chip8_prec in chip8-bc89fc.o   "_SDL_SetVideoMode", referenced from:       _chip8_prepare in chip8-bc89fc.o   "_SDL_UnlockSurface", referenced from:       _chip8_draw in chip8-bc89fc.o ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64 clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation) </code></pre>  <p>The error seems to be an issue with the <code>SDL</code> library in this case, but I've had the exact same issue with several other little projects I treid to compile. Before compiling, I installed the <code>SDL</code> libs and checked they are there:</p>  <pre><code>users-MBP:Chip-8-Emulator user$ ls /usr/local/lib/ ...            libSDL-1.2.0.dylib        libSDL.a                  libSDL.dylib              libSDLmain.a ... </code></pre>  <p>After lots of Googling it seems I'm not the only one with this problem and I couldn't find solution that worked. It seems that <code>osx</code> doesn't include <code>/use/local/lib</code> in the default linker paths. </p>  <p>How can I fix this (a permanent solution would be welcome)?</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong> Following a suggestion from user Alex I tried with <code>$ gcc -o chip8 -L/usr/local/lib chip8.c</code>. The error and output is identical to the above.</p>
