<p>There is task to be done in Excel by Solver. It seems no challenging on the first sight, but there are some side constraints make it very difficult, at least to me. So, very firstly, I am writing down the data down. <a href="http://s13.postimg.org/3o2nrnfg7/Untitled.png" rel="nofollow">Click here</a> for the data. We should minimize the cost.         </p>  <p>Side Constraints:</p>  <ul> <li>Co. 1 will not supply orders of less than 150 tons for any project (I have done this one)</li> <li>Co. 2 can supply more than 200 tons to no more than one of the projects.</li> <li>Co. 3 will accept only orders that total 200, 400, or 550 tons.</li> </ul>  <p>I have done it using binary and linking constraints for the first one. I know I can just chose less and equal to 150 directly in </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Excel-Data-Solver-Add Constraints.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Probably binary and linking constraints should be used but how?</p>
