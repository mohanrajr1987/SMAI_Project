<p>I came across the problem below in my first project. What is that linker error? Is that between model and ViewController files? </p>  <p><strong><em>Apple Mach-O Linker Error: "_OBJC_CLASS_$_ObebOkekModel", referenced from and  Apple Mach-O Linker Error: Linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)</em></strong></p>  <p>I would appreciate it if anyone can help. Thanks!</p>
