<p>I have some classes and headers that are external to my program that i wish to use. I am using MSVC2013 and have specified the location of these files in the "Additional include directories" entry in the project settings window. Intellisense recognises the paths and provides the appropriate syntax highlight and my program compiles fine except at the end it throws LNK2019 errors for any usage of these classes. Is there another place in linker settings I need to specify to link external files or am i missing something obvious here.</p>  <p>Error messages:</p>  <pre><code>MainWindow.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol "public: __cdecl QPropertyEditorWidget::QPropertyEditorWidget(class QWidget *)" (??0QPropertyEditorWidget@@QEAA@PEAVQWidget@@@Z) referenced in function "public: __cdecl MainWindow::MainWindow(class QWidget *)" (??0MainWindow@@QEAA@PEAVQWidget@@@Z) </code></pre>
