<p>I am trying to port a program made using OpenCV 2.4 (not 3) from OSX to iOS 7 (not 8, or 9)</p>  <p>I followed their tutorial, that worked until it complained of jpeg linking errors, I pasted the errors on google, and found on their issue tracker a solution, and a link to the jpeg library, I downloaded it, did all the steps correctly, and now it compiles and runs, but crashes on startup and complains with the following error:</p>  <pre><code>dyld: Library not loaded: /opt/libjpeg-turbo/lib/libjpeg.62.dylib Reason: image not found </code></pre>  <p>I have no idea how to fix it</p>
