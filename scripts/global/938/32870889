<p>This is known Visual Studio build sequence â€“ I'd like to identify action during 3rd image from above:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/mH6ob.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/mH6ob.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>When I launch the application built in <a href="/questions/tagged/visual-studio-2015" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;visual-studio-2015&#39;" rel="tag">visual-studio-2015</a>, status line turns dark blue saying <code>Build started...</code> (see second image). After some time, it is replaced by <code>Ready</code> (see 3rd image), but <strong>nothing is actually ready</strong>. Is it still the same build phase (just with initial <code>Build started...</code> label timed-out?) or is it some different phase of build? Where I can see what's behind the scenes?</p>  <p>Build output window says only:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>1>------ Build started: Project: Project1, Configuration: Debug Any CPU ------<br>   1>  Project1 -> D:\path\Project1.exe<br>   ========== Build: 1 succeeded, 0 failed, 0 up-to-date, 0 skipped ==========</p> </blockquote>  <p>In this case, I was building single <a href="/questions/tagged/vb.net" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;vb.net&#39;" rel="tag">vb.net</a> project referencing couple of custom DLL's.</p>
