<p>I am new to FULL-Stack/MEAN-Stack. I've gone through Microsoft Virtual Studios Tutorial and a couple other tutorials without issue.  Now I'm trying to walk through an example in Chpt.26 of Brad Dayley's NodeJS, MongoDB, &amp; AngularJS Web Development. </p>  <p>I've set up the project as shown, but every time I navigate to my directory in git shell and prompt "node server" it throws an error. I've checked the book's GitHub repository to make sure everything is in place and it matches up. </p>  <p>He doesn't list "body-parser", "cookie-parser", or "express-session" as necessary dependencies, but they are "required" in the "server.js" file, so I would think they are necessary dependencies in my "node_modules" folder, (so I installed all 3). This is the closest I've gotten to any resolution. I'm attaching two links to screen shots of the server.js file view and cmd terminal views. </p>  <p>Any help/input would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!</p>  <p>**First link is the server.js file view **Second are the CMD Terminal Views</p>  <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_Hrwst6pth8Y1RHQVltTkJqSGM/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_Hrwst6pth8Y1RHQVltTkJqSGM/view?usp=sharing</a></p>  <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_Hrwst6pth8UzlNcm5YTlVKVGs/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_Hrwst6pth8UzlNcm5YTlVKVGs/view?usp=sharing</a></p>
