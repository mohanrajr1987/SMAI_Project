<p>I have a model set up like this:</p>  <pre><code>STUFFS = ("COOL STUFF", "AWESOME STUFF", "BORING STUFF")  class Stuff(db.Document):      type = db.StringField(choices=STUFFS, required=True) </code></pre>  <p>When I try to save a type that is not inside <code>STUFFS</code>, for example:</p>  <pre><code>stuff = Stuff(type="OTHER STUFF") stuff.save() #=&gt; Throws a Validation error, but somehow it still saves this invalid data into database </code></pre>  <p>I expect MongoDB to throw an error (which it does), and prevent writing into the database. However, it still manages to save the invalid data. Any one knows why? </p>  <p>Thank you all!</p>
