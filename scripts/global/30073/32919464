<p>I am experiencing this odd behaviour with mongo shell.</p>  <p>I know the documents are created because I can then call them up in the browser when I do a request, however when I run mongo shell and do a db.collectionname.count(); etc. it returns nothing.</p>  <p>Might happen because I didn't shutdown the server properly etc. ? I am certain /data is the only directory that mongod uses for database storage and I have tried deleting all files/databases in this directory and they are created again when Node.js application runs and the documents are created too, but mongo shell shows nothing in the collections after I insert data into them. The 'show dbs' command will show the database and show collections shows the collections, but nothing that is in the collection.</p>  <p>Any ideas ? Perhaps there's some way to flush cache or something else that may be effecting mongo shell ?</p>
