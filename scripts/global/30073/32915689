<p>When I see questions on stackoverflow.com, I find <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/</a><strong>11234554</strong> that each post has individual url. </p>  <p>I have made a Q&amp;A list that pulls data from mongoDB and an html page to have each question. Do I create the URL based on the question number from database? If so, how can I append /11234554 to /questions ? I can make GET request to each item on the list, but what then?</p>  <pre><code>router.get('/questions', function(req, res, next){     "How do I make GET request to every question number?"          }) </code></pre>  <p>Any guide will be appreciated!</p>
