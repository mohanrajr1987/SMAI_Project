<p>First of all, I am a freshman in terms of Java EE and the Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers. So please pardon me if my concern seems kinda trivial, but I did research for quite a while now and couldn't find any helpful resource regarding my problem.</p>  <p>I would like to establish a NoSQL database connection for my project (using JPA and EclipseLink) to a MongoDB running on the default (localhost:27017). I activated JPA 2.1 under my Project Facets and got stuck at the further configuration, especially the part with the Connection Profile (see images below).</p>  <p>What Connection Profile do I have to choose? Does one of the available profiles even match my concern (MongoDB)? Am I on the right path at all or is my approach nonsense?</p>  <p>Any help would be highly appreciated. I am open for all kind of suggestions.</p>  <p>Let me know if you need more information.</p>  <p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/HZphU" rel="nofollow">Choice of Connection Profile</a></p>
