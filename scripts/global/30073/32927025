<p>I am trying my hand at development on a Mac for the first time since about 1988. I'm finding myself to be just a tad rusty. :)</p>  <p>I installed nodejs without error. I also installed mongodb based on these instructions: <a href="http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/" rel="nofollow">http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/</a>. That install went well after fixing a few errors with file names in the document.</p>  <p>I created a folder off of the root of Computer/Mac HD named Web Sites and copied a few sites from my Windows box to it. </p>  <p>What is the dbpath to this folder that I should use when starting mongod?</p>
