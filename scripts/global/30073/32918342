<p>From the <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver/wiki/Quickstart-Guide-(New-Driver)#build-and-install-the-c-driver" rel="nofollow">CXX Driver Quickstart guide</a> I've been completely unable to finish the compilation of the new driver on either a Ubuntu or CentOS VM.</p>  <p>I've followed the steps to the letter several time, but I'm not sure where I have gone wrong. </p>  <pre><code>In file included from /home/sam/downloads/mongo-cxx-driver/src/mongocxx/private/bulk_write.hpp:20:0,                  from /home/sam/downloads/mongo-cxx-driver/src/mongocxx/bulk_write.cpp:19: /home/sam/downloads/mongo-cxx-driver/src/mongocxx/private/libmongoc.hpp:31:63: error: ‘mongoc_client_pool_set_ssl_opts’ was not declared in this scope  #define MONGOCXX_LIBMONGOC_SYMBOL(name) constexpr auto name = mongoc_##name;                                                                ^ /home/sam/downloads/mongo-cxx-driver/src/mongocxx/private/libmongoc_symbols.hpp:42:1: note: in expansion of macro ‘MONGOCXX_LIBMONGOC_SYMBOL’  MONGOCXX_LIBMONGOC_SYMBOL(client_pool_set_ssl_opts) </code></pre>  <p>I've redone this several times. Several times I have reinstalled the entire operating system. The error in question relates to the 1.2 development version of mongo-c-driver. I've made sure to install it, but somethign has gone wrong.</p>
