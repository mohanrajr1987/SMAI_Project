<p>I have to insert many documents in a MongoDB collection, using the new C# 2.0 driver. Is using either collection.InsertManyAsync(...)  collection.BulkWriteAsync(...) making any difference? (particularly about performance).</p>  <p>From what i understand from MongoDB documentation, an insert with an array of documents should be a bulk operation under the hood. Is that correct? </p>  <p>Thanks for your help.</p>
