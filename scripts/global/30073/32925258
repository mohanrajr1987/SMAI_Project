<p>Good Morning and day to all! I hope this makes sense. I was on here last week as I was missing one step to change my <code>app.js</code> file to <code>server.js</code> and got enough help to make it work. I am returning with an new issue that perhaps stem from that one.. Here is what's happening: </p>  <p>I am working on a MEAN app and I've been working as usual typing <code>mongod</code> to have mongoDB running. and i was using <code>npm start</code> because it was advice to me but usually i use <code>nodemon</code></p>  <p>I've noticed that gradually my server just completely disconnects and I have to manually restart it by typing 'npm start' again. The connection last about 1 minute before it loses it. However now it doesn't connect at all. I think it has something to do with losing connection to MongoDB because I have a <code>console.log</code> for whenever I don't have mongoDB running to remind me.. (and this is the console log that my server spits out)</p>  <p><strong>server.js</strong></p>  <pre><code>require('net').connect(27017, 'locahost').on('error', function(){ console.log("He's name is MongoDB live from port 27017");  process.exit(0);  }); </code></pre>  <p>I tried switching back to running it with <code>nodemon</code> while it gives me the impression that it's connected as it doesn't spit out any errors when I update any part of my code or refresh the page, it just spits out the console.log message that I showed above and I have to exit and restart..with <code>npm run devel</code> I have no luck either. (this is not happening in other applications)</p>  <p>Here is a look at my command line with all 3 attempts to connect to the server and notice how it spits out the <code>console.log</code> message.. I refresh my page and it doesn't connect at all anymore. It used to! as I mentioned before but for a minute or so. I hope someone can help me out and point me in the right direction.</p>  <p>using <code>npm start</code>, <code>npm run devel</code> and <code>nodemon</code></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/9Y40Z.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/9Y40Z.png" alt="my terminal starting server"></a> </p>  <p>Package.JSON file </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/TgjcX.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/TgjcX.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
