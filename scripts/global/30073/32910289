<p>I'm writing some mongoDB queries for Friend relationship. Suppose there is a User document that looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>User: {     _id: 1     Friends: [2,3,8] // an array of identifier } </code></pre>  <p>If I want to write queries for two users to become friends, I need to write two queries:</p>  <pre><code>  db.Users.update({_id: x}, {$push: {Friends: y}});    db.Users.update({_id: y}, {$push: {Friends: x}}); </code></pre>  <p>My question is: can I combine those two above to one query? If yes, how to write it?</p>
