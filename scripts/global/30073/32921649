<p>We are planning to use MongoDB for a general purpose system and it seems well suited to the particular data and use cases we have. </p>  <p>However we have one use case where we will need to compare every document (of which there could be 10s of millions) with every other document. The 'distance measure' could be pre computed offline by another system but we are concerned about the online performance of MongoDB when we want to query - eg when we want to see the top 10 closest documents in the entire collection to a list of specific documents ... </p>  <p>Is this likely to be slow? Also can this be done across documents (eg query for the top10 closest documents in one collection to a document in another collection)...</p>  <p>Thanks in advance,</p>  <p>FK</p>
