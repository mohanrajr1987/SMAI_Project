<p><br> I accidentally deleted 2 data(mydb.47,mydb.62) files from my /data/db of my mongodb. I have rest of the files in place...<br> Now my mongodb won't start up..I tried repairing it using this command <code> sudo -u mongod  mongod  --dbpath /data/db-new --repair --repairpath /data/db </code> Repair finished with no errors. Mongo docs say <code>  You may also wish <strong>to move the repaired files to the old database location</strong> or update the dbPath to indicate the new location </code> I copied the files from /data/db-new to /data/db and started mongo server. But it is not starting..is there any way I could reclaim my data?</p>
