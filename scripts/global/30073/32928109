<p>So I'm storing a log of users that join an IRC chat, keeping the time they logged in (and other stuff) and the time they log off, right now I'm adding a new entry every time that happens and whenever I need the info I just take it all and use Last() to get the latest one, I recognize this is inefficient since it'll only get slower as time passes and more users log in, so how can I update the last entry (so I don't have to remove everything and lose all I got until now) but, if that user hasn't joined before, create a new entry instead. </p>  <p>While at it, is there an efficient way to remove all entries except for the last one? </p>  <p>The programming language I'm using is C#. </p>
