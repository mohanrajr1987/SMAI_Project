<p>I have done CRUD of AngularJs and SpringMVC..  As angular Provides a Single Page Application for front end my routing is through AngularJS, i want to use Spring security features like Authentication Object and SecurityContext in my filter having custom implementation of Database authentication.. Well to be frank, i did some research but I am not able to put all the pieces together -> Filter + Session + AuthService + XML AccessManagement.</p>  <p>I know the Question is been asked many times before but I am not able to put all together.</p>
