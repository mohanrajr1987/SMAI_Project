<p>Some days ago i assisted to a project meeting( as part of my career) and they were discussing about this new product: a fiscalization software, in theory a  huge system and had to be a web solution. Somebody asked why not using Symfony2 and the guy i think was the architect toll him that, because the dimensions of the sw and the amount of data maybe a Spring framework was a better approach... and the war began. </p>  <p>So, my question is, in which context is better using one or another framework??? I dnt think that "the language benefits" is so important given that php has evolved very much after the 5.4 version, so that of "i do this in java but you dont in php" is not longer applied. Besides, these both frameworks are great, so where should be or not applied one or another???</p>
