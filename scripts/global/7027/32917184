<p>I have been researching how to perform URL rewrites on Tomcat 8 and keep running into the same two suggestions.</p>  <p>1) Use Tuckey URLRewriteFilter. 2) Run Apache on top of Tomcat to use mod_rewrite.</p>  <p>In regards to the former, URLRewriteFilter doesn't appear to have any documentation about how to configure in a Java format as opposed to XML. My Spring MVC application does not make use of a web.xml file - all configuration is done via Java classes - and so I'm not in a position to configure with XML. </p>  <p>Is there any way to configure in this way or are there any good alternatives other than trying to run Apache on top of Tomcat?</p>  <p>For example, is there a way to achieve this in Java as opposed to XML:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;filter&gt;    &lt;filter-name&gt;UrlRewriteFilter&lt;/filter-name&gt;    &lt;filter-class&gt;org.tuckey.web.filters.urlrewrite.UrlRewriteFilter&lt;/filter-class&gt; &lt;/filter&gt; &lt;filter-mapping&gt;     &lt;filter-name&gt;UrlRewriteFilter&lt;/filter-name&gt;     &lt;url-pattern&gt;/*&lt;/url-pattern&gt;     &lt;dispatcher&gt;REQUEST&lt;/dispatcher&gt;     &lt;dispatcher&gt;FORWARD&lt;/dispatcher&gt; &lt;/filter-mapping&gt; </code></pre>
