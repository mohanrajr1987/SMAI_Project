<p>I need to create a website using Spring MVC so I'm using STS for this purpose. I'm also using maven as a build tool.</p>  <p>I'm new to java so I'm having a hard time figuring where to keep thing or what directory structure to follow. STS helped me create a Starter Spring project which looks like the following</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/cQteb.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/cQteb.png" alt="Project Structure"></a></p>  <p>I have a custom jar file xyz.jar that I need to consume as a service in this website. </p>  <p>Can some please guide me where this file should be kept and how to include it in the build output ?</p>
