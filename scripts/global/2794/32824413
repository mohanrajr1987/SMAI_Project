<p>I would like to know how to keep the tab chars in the content of an HTML textarea when putting it in a variable in jQuery. The explanation is as below: I have a form containing a textarea and a button. The problem is that when I put a text containing some tab chars (For example, like what is below. As you can see, there is a tab char between "Chappell Hill" and "TX" and there is another tab char between "TX" and "77426"):</p>  <pre><code>Chappell Hill   TX  77426 </code></pre>  <p>then I click on the button, a pop-up message displays the text without any tab chars, exactly as below:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Chappell HillTX77426</p> </blockquote>  <p>This is the jQuery code that I have:</p>  <pre><code>$("#massmetrotagupdate").on("click", ".update_form",      var note_text = $("#note_text").val();               alert(note_text); });  </code></pre>  <p>So, my question is: How can I keep the tab chars in the variable <code>note_text</code> and even display what I type exactly in the textarea in the pop-message (without deleting the tab chars)? Is there any solution for that?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
