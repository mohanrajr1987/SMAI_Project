<p>Take a long continuous string of text like so:</p>  <pre><code>Question?Thisisanissuewithusingquestionmarks </code></pre>  <p>In all versions of IE, the line breaks unexpectedly after the question mark. In  IE9+ this is countered by using <code>white-space: pre;</code>, but IE8 seems to ignore it (even though it's supported). The only way I've been able to get this to wrap as normal (i.e. not line break at the question mark) is by using a mono-spaced font, but this also extends the length of the textarea. Any ideas?</p>  <p><strong>To summarize:</strong> I want a HTML/CSS solution to having the line not break on to a new line after the ? mark in IE8.</p>  <p>Fiddle: <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/8m5yea9y/" rel="nofollow">https://jsfiddle.net/8m5yea9y/</a></p>  <p>Example of how it's working fine in IE9+ using <code>white-space: pre;</code></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/uW14Y.gif" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/uW14Y.gif" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
