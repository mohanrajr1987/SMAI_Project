<p>I am experiencing the following problem with a <code>Select all</code> action item applied to a text edited inside of a <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> element in <strong>Safari</strong> on <strong>iPhone 5</strong>. Namely, upon applying selection of a longer text (exceeding visible dimensions of a <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code>) a light-blue <em>highlight</em> marking selected text spans out of an actual element, covering other areas of a view port. I would expect it to just mark the text inside of an active element as <em>highlighted</em>, and not outside of it.</p>  <p>A screenshot below should give you a better idea of how it looks like (an actual <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> element has been marked with a red rectangle).</p>  <p>Is it a known <strong>Safari</strong>/<strong>iPhone 5</strong> bug or am I missing something (like applying a proper CSS styling or such)?</p>  <p>Many thanks in advance for your assistance!</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/mZUbh.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/mZUbh.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
