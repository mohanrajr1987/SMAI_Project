<p>I am working in MVC 5 and i have a HTML.TextArea that has an initial value on page load. It loads up correctly but if you type anything in the textarea or change anything, the value doesn't update in the DOM. I can look at the page source and it doesn't change. I also tried HTML.TextAreaFor to try a binding approach but that also failed to update any changes to the initial value. I can't find anything on google for this issue so hopefully someone can shed light on this odd behavior. I avoid TextArea's like a plague so knowledge is limited with them. </p>  <pre><code>@HTML.TextArea("MyTextArea","My Test Text") </code></pre>  <p>Loads "My Test Text" and then if you type "but it no work!" The DOM/Postback value will not be updated with added text, returns ("My Test Text")</p>
