<p>I can identify my currently focussed textbox with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Selection" rel="nofollow">Window.selection</a>:</p>  <pre><code>var selection = window.getSelection(); </code></pre>  <p>I can identify the caret position with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Selection/focusOffset" rel="nofollow">Selection.focusOffset</a>:</p>  <pre><code>var focus = selection.focusOffset; </code></pre>  <p>Let's say that <code>focus</code> is currently <strong>8</strong>, so the caret is <strong>8</strong> characters in.</p>  <p>How do I move the caret position, so it's e.g. <strong>5</strong> characters in?</p>  <p>Example method:</p>  <pre><code>selection.setFocusOffset(5); // this method does not exist, so I need something similar </code></pre>  <p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Selection/extend" rel="nofollow">Selection.extend()</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Selection/modify" rel="nofollow">Selection.modify()</a> methods are able to move around the caret to some extend, but in my usecase where I manipulate and replace content inside the selection I need a more simple way to just determine how many characters in I want to place the caret. Btw: my textbox is a <a href="https://github.com/Voog/wysihtml" rel="nofollow">wysihtml</a> textarea, which means that it's not technically a textarea div.</p>
