<p>I am experiencing the following problem with a <em>cursor</em> display while scrolling a text area in <strong>Safari</strong> on <strong>iPhone 5</strong>. Namely, a <em>cursor</em> rendered inside of an active <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> element does not scroll together with the rest of a text. Its display is stuck in a constant position, however once you stop scrolling and type text on a keyboard again, the viewport will be moved to a real cursor position, cursor will be displayed correctly and a newly typed character will appear where the cursor really was (and not in a middle of a line where it was displayed stuck while scrolling).</p>  <p>A screenshot below should give you a better idea of how it looks like (blinking cursor has been encircled).</p>  <p>Is it a known <strong>Safari</strong>/<strong>iPhone 5</strong> bug or am I missing something (like applying a proper CSS styling or such)?</p>  <p>Many thanks in advance for your assistance!</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/nBw1o.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/nBw1o.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
