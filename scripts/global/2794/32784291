<p>I feel this should be easy to do, I just don't know how to start.</p>  <p>I have a textarea where users will be able to add a description for something. Usually users will like to add links to pages such us "<a href="http://www.google.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com</a>". However, the textarea tag sees it as plain text and not as a link.</p>  <p>How can i solve this?</p>  <p>Thanks for any help!</p>
