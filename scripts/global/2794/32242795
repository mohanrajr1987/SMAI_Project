<p>I try to describe my problem. I have a XML with data from a test. This XML will be transformed by XSL. I have inserted an href to the *.xsl, so when I open the XML i will see the XML in HTML format. Now i want to comment the results in a textarea. </p>  <p>I have inserted a textarea after each test-section to comment the results. This works so far, but how can i keep the typed text in the textarea? Even if I save the file(XML) as HTML the textarea is still be empty.</p>  <p>Sorry for my English, i am not a native speaker</p>
