<p>Can't find any info on this.</p>  <p>Simply trying to use 'disabled' on my iron-autogrow-textarea with no avail. Doesn't work anyway i try it, javascript or directly on element. Documentation also doesn't seem to give any insight.</p>  <p>Anyone have any info? Am i missing something simple?</p>  <pre><code> &lt;iron-autogrow-textarea disabled style="border:none; width: 80%;" bind-value="{{bookingDetails}}"&gt;&lt;/iron-autogrow-textarea&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Thanks everyone, Ryann.</p>
