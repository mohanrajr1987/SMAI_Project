<p>I am trying to append a LinkedHashSet to a textArea in java 8. The code below works but it doesn't add the content line by line, and it adds them all in one line. </p>  <pre><code>Code:     textArea.setText(textArea.getText() + linkedHashSet);     [   lin1,       line2,      line3,      line4] </code></pre>  <p>I am looking to append them to the textArea as listed below</p>  <pre><code>line1 line2 line3 line4 </code></pre>
