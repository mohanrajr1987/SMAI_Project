<p>I have a small website where the user can input some text and this text is then processed in different ways, for example all chars are converted to uppercase/lowercase and other useful gimmicks. The results are shown in multiple textarea-blocks. I want the website to be usable on mobile devices so I use Bootstrap. Normally each textarea gets it's own row, but I want to group some of them by  placing two or three next to each other.</p>  <p>My code (for two textareas) currently looks like the following:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;body&gt;     &lt;div class="container-fluid text-center"&gt;         &lt;div class="row"&gt;             &lt;div class="col-md-4 col-md-offset-2"&gt;                 &lt;textarea                     id="textarea1"                     class="form-control"                 &gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;             &lt;/div&gt;              &lt;div class="col-md-4"&gt;                 &lt;textarea                     id="textarea2"                     class="form-control"                 &gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;             &lt;/div&gt;         &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/body&gt; </code></pre>  <p><strong><a href="https://jsfiddle.net/kbh69otv/" rel="nofollow">JSFiddle</a></strong></p>  <p>This kinda works and looks as expected, but as soon as the user tries to resize the textarea, the left textarea gets behind the right one, like <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/qjolW.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/qjolW.jpg" alt="in the following picture"></a>:</p>  <p>I believe this happens because of Bootstraps grid-system.</p>  <p>Is there any way to have the textareas 'push' each other and have a responsive design at the same time?</p>
