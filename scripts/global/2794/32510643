<p>I'm trying to setup a page in which users can insert a word (or some words) and that words they typed are stored in a database and shown in page itself.</p>  <p>ex.  - you type "banana" the page save your word and then shows it;  - you friend type "mountain", then you will see "banana" and "mountain".</p>  <p>look at here: www.francescogosce.com/sandbox/input</p>  <p>I have not created a database yet, I simply put some words in an array that are display randomly when you move the cursor. I want to do exactly the same thing but with users input.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
