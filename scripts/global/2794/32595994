<p>I took a look at this code: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/mgfv8nk8/9/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/mgfv8nk8/9/</a></p>  <p><code>$("#btnLeft").click(function () {</code></p>  <p>there's two text area, one on each sides. What I would simply like to do is to add two more text areas but another two sets of left and right arrows along with.</p>  <p>Text area 1 (primary table that shows the list) works with text area 2 put on left and right arrow</p>  <p>Text area 4 (secondary table that shows the list) works with text area 3 put on left and right arrow</p>  <p><em>Note:</em> Text area 2 must be only with Text area 1 by using the arrows Text area 4 must only work with text area 3</p>  <p>Is there a way to expand this code?</p>
