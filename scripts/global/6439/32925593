<p>How do I tell <code>less</code>, with <code>-R</code> or otherwise, not to reset colors across newlines(<code>\n</code>)? Here's an example of what I see:</p>  <pre><code>$ echo -e '\033[31mThis is red.\nStill red.\n\033[0mBack now.' &gt;&gt; coltest $ cat coltest This is red. #Colour is red Still red.   #Colour is red Back now.    #Colour is the terminal's foreground colour. $ less -RF coltest This is red. #Colour is red Still red.   #Colour is the terminal's foreground colour. Back now.    #Colour is the terminal's foreground colour. </code></pre>  <p>Why is the colour of <code>Still red.</code> reset to the terminal's foreground colour in the output of <code>less -RF</code>?</p>
