<p>Here's my code so far. My plan is to eventually give each variable a randomized value but when I update them in my game, but in the class I think I should create instance variables and initialize them to something. </p>  <pre><code>import UIKit  class Planet: CCNode {     var mass: Int = 0     var radius: Int = 0     var color: } </code></pre>  <p>I don't know how to initialize a color though. Which type would I use and what is a value I could initialize it to? Also, is this a good practice when creating a CCNode for your game? I'm not using CCSprite because I want to be able to randomly change the variables when I update them. </p>
