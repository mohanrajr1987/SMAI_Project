<p>I was wondering, normal SVGs in CSS are useless because you cannot change their colors, so would it be good idea to use SVGs that are generated by a server script, to which you can pass arguments. Like this</p>  <pre><code>icon{   background: url('http://sitee.com/get-svg.php?name=icon5&amp;color=#c00'); } </code></pre>  <p>So you see now I can pass whatever color I want.</p>  <p>But is it a good idea? Because I know that live stylesheets are not: @import "get-stylesheet.php" ...</p>
