<p>I have a Mac App (<a href="https://coderunnerapp.com" rel="nofollow">CodeRunner</a>) that executes a script in login mode and shows the output in a window. In error condition, it returns the code with escape characters to make the output hard to read. </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Iob7l.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Iob7l.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Is there a way to process the color code? Is there a filter to remove the color code? </p>
