<p>I have a function that I pass r g and b to that then returns a color, r g and b are between 0.0 and 1.0.</p>  <p>I need to interpolate the colors I pass the function from red to yellow to green, based on a percentage from 0.0 to 1.0.</p>  <p>I found this other SO answer <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5406681/color-interpolation-between-3-colors">Color interpolation between 3 colors</a> but I'm not sure how I would apply it to my case.</p>
