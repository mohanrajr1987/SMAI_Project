<p>For some reason, visual studio 2015 is VERY buggy when it comes to coloring. I did not have any of these issues with 2013. For example, if I type:</p>  <pre><code>int *array = new int[100]; </code></pre>  <p>Then the "new i" will be black while "nt" is in blue. I would expect all of it to be blue or whatever colors you choose. It fixes this if I disable colorization semantics but that makes the colorization not recognize macros, parameters, and a bunch of other stuff so that isn't a solution. Any ideas?</p>
