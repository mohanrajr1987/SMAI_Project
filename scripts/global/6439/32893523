<p>im new to the whole batch thing, so i figured i should just ask this because i cant find it somewhere else: I made a LAN chat thingy, and want changeable colors (only by admin) this is what i did:</p>  <p>(In the read batch)</p>  <pre><code>@echo off  type color.dat :read cls type log.dat timeout /t 3 /nobreak &gt;nul goto read </code></pre>  <p>(in the admin batch)</p>  <pre><code>:color cls echo Set new chat color: echo 0 = black  a = L green echo 1 = blue   b = L aqua echo 2 = green  c = L red echo 3 = aqua   d = L purple echo 4 = red    e = L yellow echo 5 = purple f = L white echo 6 = yellow  echo 7 = white   echo 8 = gray    echo 9 = L blue  set /p clr= :  echo color %clr% &gt; color.dat timeout /t 2 /nobreak echo New color set! pause &gt;nul </code></pre>  <p>I want to run the color.dat as a command, example: color 4e > color.dat -----OTHER FILE------- type color.dat I want it to run color.dat as the given color by the admin (im not very good in explaining :|) i want it to work in mutiple batch files in the same directory..</p>  <p>(Solved)</p>
