<p>I would like to know how to assign different colors according to a selected field in gravity forms. </p>  <p>I will expand further:</p>  <p>In the backend of gravity forms i see a list of users that have filled a form and they are assigned a "case status" i would like to be able to assign colors to those case statuses in order to get a better visual understanding of what is going on. </p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
