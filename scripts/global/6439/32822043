<p>I have a data set that consists of cumulative counts of three species of fish for successive transects so this consists of 3 columns (species, count, transect);</p>  <p>e.g.    </p>  <pre><code>Species Count Transect Cod     25    1 Cod     36    2 Cod     45    3 Haddock 12    1 Haddock 23    2 Haddock 34    3 </code></pre>  <p>Etc… I’m likely to have lots of species that I want to plot in a single plot so I have tried to use a loop (my first go at properly trying to use loops!!) to speed this up and have done the following</p>  <pre><code>xrange &lt;- range(Data$Transect) ymax &lt;- max(Data$Count) plot(xrange,y=c(0,ymax+10),  yaxs = "i", type="n", las=1, xlab="Transect      Number", ylab="Total Number") for (i in Data$Species){ species &lt;- subset(Data, Species==i)  lines(species$Transect, species$Count, type="o",lwd=2,lty=1,pch=NA)} </code></pre>  <p>This produces a plot with all the species in the data set with a separate line but I would like each of these lines to have a unique colour and am struggling to do this. </p>  <p>I have tried the following but it doesn’t work and all of the lines still come out as the same colour and I’m not sure what to try next?</p>  <pre><code>nspecies &lt;- levels(Data$Species) colors&lt;- rainbow(nspecies) for (i in Data$Species) {  species &lt;- subset(Trial, Species==i)  lines(species$Haul, species$Catch, type="o",lwd=2,lty=1,pch=NA,   col=colors[i])} </code></pre>  <p>Any help would be great thanks!</p>
