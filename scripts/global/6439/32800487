<p>I am a newbie, and I am not sure how to achieve what I want. Well, I have this piece of code, which I am learning currently.</p>  <pre><code>var color = ["#AAAAAA" , "#FF9992", "#BF9232"]; $("#button1").click(function() {   // I have a print a the colors in array in &lt;select&gt;&lt;option&gt;  }); </code></pre>  <p>On clicking the button I would like to create a <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> tag with all the colours in the array, populated with the <code>&lt;option&gt;</code>'s background colour being the value of the colour.</p>  <p>I am not sure how I could proceed. All I know is it can be done using jQuery as the array is dynamic. Thanks in advance.</p>
