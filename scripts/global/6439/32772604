<p>I am working on a small project where I am attempting to display NSF OpenTopography data in a point cloud visualization using three js.  I have been successful in plotting the data points, however I am having issues with understanding the color values associated with the point cloud data.  The data includes red, green and blue channels, but the values are 5 digits long for each.</p>  <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>  <p><strong>Red Channel</strong>: 16896</p>  <p><strong>Green Channel</strong>: 17408</p>  <p><strong>Blue Channel</strong>: 19456</p>  <p>How do I convert these to appropriate RGB values scaled from 0-255?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance for any guidance.</p>
