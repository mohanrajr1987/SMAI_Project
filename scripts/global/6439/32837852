<p>I created a form where users can edit the background header color of their reports by selecting a color from the ColorDialogBox and saving the string of the color to database. </p>  <p>Colors are applied by fetching the selected color (string) from database and using <code>ReportParameter</code> to apply the color. This works fine for some colors but others will not show the selected color.</p>  <p>How can I do this properly that all colors will show?</p>  <p>I apply the selected color like so</p>  <pre><code>Dim bgColor As New ReportParameter("bgColor", headerColor) 'background color </code></pre>
