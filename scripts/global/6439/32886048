<p>This may be a very specific question because I didn't find anything related. Also, sorry if I couldn't find a better title.</p>  <p>I'm working with android colors, specifically, I'm in a situation where I need to let the user programmatically change color of a view.</p>  <p>I'll give some values and example so that you can undestand better my case.</p>  <p>In my <code>res/colors.xml</code> I have this color_green with value <code>#4CAF50</code>. As soon as the activity starts, I set this color to a view. In order so set the color,I'm first converting it to a String hex color as:</p>  <pre><code>int color = myGreenColor; // This is directly taken from resource so R.color.green_color, (2131427355) int value = ContextCompat.getColor(context, color); // (-11751600) String hexColor = String.format("#%06X", (value)); // (#FF4CAF50) </code></pre>  <p>then I set it to the view with </p>  <p><code>mView.setBackgroundColor(Color.parseColor(hexColor));</code>// (-11751600) again</p>  <p>Now, the <code>myGreenColor</code> value is changed as the user pick another color from the pes8 <code>ColorPicker</code> library found <a href="https://github.com/Pes8/android-material-color-picker-dialog" rel="nofollow">at this link</a></p>  <p>Let's say I pick the exact same value which I pass to the constructor of the library in R, G, B ints.</p>  <p>If I print the returned value from the dialog, I get something like</p>  <pre><code>-11751600. </code></pre>  <p>Which I couldn't fit into any <code>set</code>, <code>parse</code> or other method. That said, how can I convert this value in order to work with the previous conversions?</p>  <p>I need to convert from format <code>-11751600</code> to format <code>2131427355</code>. or any other intermediate step value.</p>  <p>Any help would really be appreciated.</p>
