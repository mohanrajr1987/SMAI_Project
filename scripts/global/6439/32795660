<p>I have an image. I want to selectively increase the saturation of yellow in the image to max. How is this done in the RGB or HSV image space? Thanks. </p>  <p><strong>Update:</strong> I am having trouble with the code below. </p>  <pre><code>newHsv = imhsv(yellowindex,:) = yellowsatureted; </code></pre>  <p>...is producing the error "The expression to the left of the equals sign is not a valid target for an assignment". So, I think it should be: </p>  <pre><code>newHsv = imhsv(yellowindex,:) == yellowsatureted; </code></pre>  <p>However, when I change that: </p>  <pre><code>yellow = imghsv(yellowIndex, :); </code></pre>  <p>...produces the error "Index exceeds matrix dimensions". imagehsv is 2048 3072 3 and yellowIndex is 2048 3072.</p>
