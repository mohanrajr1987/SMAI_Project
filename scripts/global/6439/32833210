<p>I would like to define the color of each data point on a stripchart separately to add an extra information layer on the stripchart. I did not find a solution</p>  <p>I am aware of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22920381/different-coloring-of-groups-in-r-plot">Different coloring of groups in R plot</a>, and the answer suggests it is not possible per data point. Am I right?</p>  <p>A way around it could be to plot it column by column in a for loop, but then the x-positions are messed up</p>  <pre><code>d = c (1,3,4); e = c (2,3,4) f = c (2,6,5) data = list (d, e, f) stripchart (data, vertical =T, pch =21, bg = 1, col=2) </code></pre>  <p>Lets say, I would like to color primes in red, non-primes in blue. Or even and odd.</p>  <p>The most <strong>universal solution would take a color-list of same dimension as input</strong>, where each value defines the color of the corresponding data point plotted.</p>
