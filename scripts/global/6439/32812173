<p>I am trying to plot a Multivariate Function. However, for some reason, no matter which color I use, the Function always get plotted in black... It seems that the col="lightgreen" parameter does not work. Anybody has clues as to why?</p>  <pre><code># Define Sequences for Multivariate Function xf3x1 &lt;- seq(-100, 100, length=500) xf3x2 &lt;- seq(-100, 100, length=500)  # Outer Calculates the Cartesian Product z &lt;- outer(xf3x1,xf3x2,function(xf3x1,xf3x2) xf3x1*xf3x2) persp(xf3x1,xf3x2,z,col="lightgreen",theta=30,phi=20, main="Probl√®me 3: Function 3") </code></pre>
