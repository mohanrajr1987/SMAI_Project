<p>The objective of my application is to secure the data using a <code>Neo4j</code> graph and <code>PHP</code>. I have some users, each one has access to a specific folder. For example:</p>  <ul> <li><strong>Yannick</strong> has access to <strong>Folder1</strong> </li> <li><strong>Julie</strong> has access to <strong>Folder2</strong> </li> <li>If oneday, <strong>Yannick</strong> got access to <strong>Folder2</strong> I have to get the edge between them in <em>red</em> color.</li> </ul>  <p>I'm using <a href="http://cdn.graphalchemist.com/alchemy.min.js" rel="nofollow">alchemy.min.js</a> javascript to color a new node. I used a cluster property. But I didn't find the way to color just the newly added edge. In our example I want to color the edge between <code>__Yannick__</code> and <code>__Folder2__</code> in <code>_red_</code>, and then both nodes in <code>_green_</code>.</p>
