<p>Browser users are used to zooming content when it is too small.  This increases the detail on text and SVGs.  Unfortunately, it does not seem to increase the resolution of a &lt;canvas&gt;  I've seen a couple of articles explaining how to control whether the pixels get antialiased or pixellated.</p>  <p>What I have not found is any explanation of how to redraw the canvas at a higher resolution.  For example, if my original page has a 300x300 canvas and I zoom to 200% I would like to draw a 600x600 pixel image in that canvas and have the user see all the detail.</p>
