<p>my name is lyle. I am currently creating my project about online hotel  reservation/booking system. My problem is that I'm very confused about the algorithm in displaying the rooms that are not booked inside the range of the "check-in and check-out dates" when the customer tries to make a reservation by clicking the "check availability button". Can someone help me in creating the flow/algorithm for this system? I need some of your ideas guys. thanks :)</p>
