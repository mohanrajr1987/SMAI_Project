<p>I created a quick example of what my experiences are so far.</p>  <ol> <li>The 160px image is never loaded. </li> <li>When I change the width to 147px the 320px image is loaded. </li> <li>When I change the width to 227px the 640px image is loaded.</li> <li>When I change the width to 453px the 1280px image is loaded.</li> </ol>  <p>I would have thought that the 160px image would load until the width of the browser was greater than 160px, and the 320px image would load until the width of the browser was greater than 320px and so forth.</p>  <p>Why is that not the case?</p>  <p>Edit: Looks like stackoverflow is not a good place to test this example.  You may have to copy paste the code into your own browser to replicate the different browser sizes. <div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false"> <div class="snippet-code"> <pre class="snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>    window.onresize = displayWindowSize;     window.onload = displayWindowSize;      function displayWindowSize() {         myWidth = window.innerWidth;         myHeight = window.innerHeight;         // your size calculation code here         document.getElementById("dimensions").innerHTML = "Current screen width: " + myWidth + "px";     };</code></pre> <pre class="snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override"><code>	&lt;div id="dimensions"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; 	&lt;img src="http://imgur.com/z5X66tR" 	     srcset="http://imgur.com/z5X66tR.png 160w,  	              http://imgur.com/kPOTVv7.png 320w,  	              http://imgur.com/xj9RPrV.png 640w,  	              http://imgur.com/PgJsD95.png 1280w"&gt;</code></pre> </div> </div> </p>
