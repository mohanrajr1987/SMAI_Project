<p>I am creating a floating banner ad that is supposed to stay fixed to the bottom of the page. I created the ad and uploaded it to DoubleClick Studio. In the preview tab I'm seeing that the ad doesn't stay fixed to the bottom of the page and instead moves up and down with the content as it scrolls. I've inspected the banner on Chrome to find that the container div that houses the ad is set to position absolute instead of position fixed. If it was set to fixed this would solve the issue, but I have no control over changing the positioning of the container of the ad, I can only say where the ad should be positioned - bottom, top, left or right.</p>  <p>Has anyone experienced this issue? Does anyone have any ideas for how this can be fixed? I've reached out to a few people at DoubleClick hoping that they'll have some suggestions, but I thought that the stackoverflow community would be able to help as well.</p>  <p>If it helps, I used Google Web Designer to create the banner ad. This is the first HTML5 ad that I've created and uploaded to DoubleClick Studio. All previous ads were Flash banners.</p>
