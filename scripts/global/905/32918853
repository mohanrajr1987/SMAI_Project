<p>I think I have done a bad thing. On my site <a href="http://NWGlobalVA.com" rel="nofollow">http://NWGlobalVA.com</a> I have been playing with the idea of having the site scale with the width of the browser. I have now realized that this is a bad idea because my Elements bunch up and it starts to look terrible.</p>  <p>My issue is that I have backed myself into a corner when it comes to making this thing rigid again so that it doesn't scale. Does anyone have any advice on how I should do the above? I imagine it's something simple however I can't seem to find a way to lock down the elements so that everything displays okay. </p>
