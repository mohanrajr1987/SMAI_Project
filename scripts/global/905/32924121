<p>I am working on an HTML 5 video being played on different screens in our workplace. This video will play stuff that is going on in the company. There will be different size screens all over the place. Is there a way to make the video fit each screen fullsize without distorting the video or causing any unwanted looks in the video? The div has class named ATIViewer, the video tags are wrapped in.</p>  <pre><code>* { margin:0; padding:0; } /* to remove the top and left whitespace */ html, body { width:100%; height:100%; } /* just to be sure these are full screen */ #canvas { display:block; } /* To remove the scrollbars */  #Body {     height: 100%;     background-image: none;     overflow: hidden;     background-color: white; }  #ATIViewer:-webkit-full-screen {     width: 100%;     height: 100%; } </code></pre>
