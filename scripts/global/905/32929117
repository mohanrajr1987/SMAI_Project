<p>I am trying to make a simple webpage, but for some reason this happens to me. I am coding on a Macbook Pro, and whenever I try to open the file in any browser, the picture doesn't show up. </p>  <p>Here is my code in the editor:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;body&gt;  &lt;img src=“jeff.jpg” alt="Smiley face"&gt;  &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Here is the code in the "View Page Source" tab on Google Chrome. Not sure why the quotation mark was made into special characters, I am assuming that is the issue.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;body&gt;  &lt;img src=â€œjeff.jpgâ€ alt="Smiley face"&gt;  &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Help me with this issue please!</p>
