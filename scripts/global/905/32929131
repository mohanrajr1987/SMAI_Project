<p>I have a canvas with a bunch of objects that you can zoom in and out with using the wheel mouse.</p>  <p>I also added a mouse detection event to see when the mouse is "over" a given sprite in the canvas. It works fine when the scale is 1, but any other number and the accuracy is off, i am unsure how to fix this. The scale is related to the center of the canvas rather than the top left corner (i use translate to fix that issue).</p>  <p>This is the code in question that checks for detection:</p>  <pre><code>function check(e,element){     var data    = {};         // get mouse position relative to the element         data.x  = e.pageX - element.offsetLeft;          data.y  = e.pageY - element.offsetTop;          // el.scale = float (0.0 to 3.0)         data.x /= el.scale;         data.y /= el.scale;          // default object size is 20 pixels (a square)          var objSize  = 20 * el.scale;       for(var i = 0; i &lt; objs.length; i++){ //check all objects         var x        = objs[i].x / el.scale;         var y        = objs[i].y / el.scale;              if(data.x &gt; x - objSize &amp;&amp;                 data.x &lt; x + objSize &amp;&amp;                 data.y &gt; y - objSize &amp;&amp;                 data.y &lt; y + objSize){                 otpt.innerHTML = true; //mouse is over an object             }else{                  otpt.innerHTML = false; //not over an object             }     } } </code></pre>  <p>I have made a fiddle also <strong><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/ejp9bphm/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/ejp9bphm/</a></strong></p>  <p>Zoom in with mouse wheel to say 2.0 then hover over objects, you will see the accuracy doesn't work. But works fine if the scale is 1.0.</p>  <p>What am I getting wrong here?</p>
