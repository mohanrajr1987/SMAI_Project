<p>I have written this code:</p>  <pre><code>background: url('img/r-food-bg.png') repeat scroll 0 0; </code></pre>  <p>in my CSS file. In my desktop I have seen all images, but after uploading web server this doesn't show in mozilla, chrome, ie, opera etc.</p>  <p>Again, I wrote:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;img src="img/ing_img.png" alt=""&gt; </code></pre>  <p>in my HTML file. Same code is running in my desktop but not working in online browsers.</p>
