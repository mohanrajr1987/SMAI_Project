<p>I want to implement Reverse AJAX using DOJO javascript framework.</p>  <p>Does DOJO provide support out-of-the-box similar to others like DWR? I am using the latest DOJO. Any reference/examples would be great.</p>  <p>Also what changes would need to be done on the server-side ? I am using Java.</p>
