<p>I am facing a weird problem with the Dojo Calendar component. Basically, what I need to do is just simply parsing a JSON array of objects returned by a PHP script, in order to obtain bits of information to display some events in an agenda-like page. Here is a sample of the JSON data being retrieved.</p>  <pre><code>    &lt;?php         header('Content-Type: application/json');         echo '{             "items": [                 {                     "id":"0",                     "summary":"An event in the calendar",                     "calendar":"calendar1",                     "begin":"2015-09-21T14:14:45.221+0000",                     "end":"2015-09-21T15:14:45.221+0000"                 },                 {                     // data of another event                 }             ]         }';     ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>And here is the Dojo part of the agenda page:</p>  <pre><code>require(["dojo/parser", "dojo/store/Memory", "dojo/data/ObjectStore",           "dojo/request", "dojox/calendar/Calendar",          "dojo/_base/Deferred", "dijit/_base/manager",           "dojo/store/Observable", "dojo/domReady!"],   function(parser, Memory, ObjectStore, request, Calendar, Deferred,           manager, Observable){     request.get("https://www.mysite.tld/management/utils/eventsCal.php",{         handleAs: "json"     }).then(function(data){         calendarStore = new Observable( new Memory({ data: data.items}));         //debug line                 console.log(calendarStore);          var calendar = new Calendar({             dateInterval: "month",             store: calendarStore         }, "agenda");          parser.parse();         calendar.startup();         parser.parse();      });          }); </code></pre>  <p>And last, this is the error it is generating:</p>  <pre><code>TypeError: _6 is undefined </code></pre>  <p>I wonder which is the problem generating this, because it seems a Dojo error, rather than a code bug... Before doing some small changes, I was getting a similar error about <code>_9.query</code>, and again, this seemed to be a Dojo error...</p>  <p>Can anybody see something in my code that I didn't notice and that could be causing this issue? Thanks in advance!</p>
