<p>How can I obtain the text of label directly from server??, because I can't associate a number to a unknown text as </p>  <pre><code>chart.addAxis("x", {     labels: [{value: 1, text: "Jan"}, {value: 2, text: "Feb"},     {value: 3, text: "Mar"}, {value: 4, text: "Apr"},     {value: 5, text: "May"}, {value: 6, text: "Jun"},     {value: 7, text: "Jul"}, {value: 8, text: "Aug"},     {value: 9, text: "Sep"}, {value: 10, text: "Oct"} </code></pre>  <p>In my case the text of label come from a database and I can't associate with a value.  Please help me with that. Thanks</p>
