<p>I am thinking of making a web app and was contemplating using dojox/app to do it.</p>  <p>I would prefer to use a more programmatic approach to dojo but it seems dojox/app is mostly declarative.</p>  <p>After some searching I found an archive basically asking the same question I have <a href="http://dojo-toolkit.33424.n3.nabble.com/Questions-about-dojox-app-design-td3988709.html" rel="nofollow">http://dojo-toolkit.33424.n3.nabble.com/Questions-about-dojox-app-design-td3988709.html</a></p>  <blockquote>   <p>Hay guys,    I've been looking at the livedocs for dojox.app and while it seems quite cool I >have to say some stuff isn't clear to me. </p>      <p>Specifically, is the "template" property of views - specifying an html file - a >must or optional?  </p> </blockquote>  <p>This was in 2012.</p>  <p>Since then I have found the customeApp test in the examples in the documentation which seems to show basic  programmatic views in dojox/app however I am having some difficulty understanding it.</p>  <p>I would like to create the different views of my app like this </p>  <pre><code>require([   "dojo/dom",   "dojo/ready",   "dojox/mobile/Heading",   "dojox/mobile/ToolBarButton" ], function(dom, ready, Heading, ToolBarButton){   ready(function(){     var heading = new Heading({       id: "viewHeading",       label: "World Clock"     });     heading.addChild(new ToolBarButton({label:"Edit"}));     var tb = new ToolBarButton({       icon:"mblDomButtonWhitePlus",       style:"float:right;"     });     tb.on("click", function(){ console.log('+ was clicked'); });     heading.addChild(tb);     heading.placeAt(document.body);     heading.startup();   }); }); </code></pre>  <p>but I can only find examples like this</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div data-dojo-type="dojox/mobile/Heading" data-dojo-props='label:"World Clock"'&gt;   &lt;span data-dojo-type="dojox/mobile/ToolBarButton"&gt;Edit&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span data-dojo-type="dojox/mobile/ToolBarButton"         data-dojo-props='icon:"mblDomButtonWhitePlus"'         style="float:right;" onclick="console.log('+ was clicked')"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Is there a way to go about this programmatically or somewhere I can find some clarification on whats happening here <a href="https://github.com/dmachi/dojox_application/tree/master/tests/customApp" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/dmachi/dojox_application/tree/master/tests/customApp</a></p>
