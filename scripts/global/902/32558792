<p>How to call a remote API for add/edit/delete node when using a parent-child relationship JSON data?</p>  <p>I've created my scenario in dojo. In the example, when click on node, we are getting Add, Edit and delete options.</p>  <p>When click on the Add, the add functionality is not working. On Edit, I should be using own view template and over-right the save functionality. On Delete, I should show the confirmation dialog and should call a function to perform the delete operation. Also, the k-rebind is not working in our scenario. I'm loading the diagram by default with out data. I've a call to the rest to get the data for the diagram. Once I received the data. I want to rebind the diagram. but it is not rebinding.</p>  <p>Kindly help to resolve the above issues.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
