<p>I have textbox currently i have attached <strong>DOJO</strong> event and for every key press it is triggering event but is there any event in <strong>DOJO</strong> that should trigger only after keyboard typing is completed.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div  class="cell"&gt; &lt;input type="search" name="searchbox" id="searchbox" placeholder="Search Location" data-dojo-attach-event = "keypress:_getData"/&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  _getData:function(){          alert("function triggered");              } </code></pre>  <p>Where this keypress is the event from <strong>dojo/keys</strong>.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Currently if i type "STACK" the event is triggering 5 times instead it   should trigger one time after typing full word or it should trigger   only after he stops typing.</p> </blockquote>
