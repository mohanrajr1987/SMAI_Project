<p>I am trying to understand why the opening tab gets focused automatically. It is created programmatically. And vendor(dojo) files we do not change as they are part of build so any idea on how I can correct or override this behaviour? Is this a normal behaviour? There is a tool tip attached to the label of the tab, so it fires up also when it is focused which is not ideal as the tooltip can be massive since it is dynamically filled. And I only want it to appear when user hovers over the tab label.</p>
