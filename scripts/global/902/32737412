<p>I have downloaded the ArcGIS JSAPI from :- <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/en/downloads/" rel="nofollow">https://developers.arcgis.com/en/downloads/</a></p>  <p>I followed the steps given in "install.htm" file and changed the url in <code>init.js</code> and <code>dojo.js</code>. I am not deploying my application on any server. I am packaging it using cordova and building it as a app (android). When I try to run the app, the urls formed by init.js are not correct. I am not sure on the path to provide in the files.</p>  <p>My App follows the general cordova structure</p>  <pre><code>cordovaProject --&gt; www Folder --&gt; esriResources </code></pre>  <p>So When I remote dubug the application, the url shown on the header is <strong>file:///android_asset/www/index.html</strong></p>  <p>But when the esri calls are made, the url is as below:- <strong><a href="http://android_asset/www/esriResources/3.14compact/esri/arcgis/utils.js" rel="nofollow">http://android_asset/www/esriResources/3.14compact/esri/arcgis/utils.js</a></strong></p>  <p>I am not sure if the url being formed is correct or not. Checked online but every example is hosting their application on some server unlike my case.</p>  <p>I absolutely need this since my app is going to work offline in many scenarios. So Need the <code>esri/toolbars, esri/Geometry/, esri/Symbols</code> in offline</p>  <p>Any help is appreciated.Thanks in Advance.</p>
