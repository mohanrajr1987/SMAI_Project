<p>I am confused with "Event Listener", "Event Handler", "Event Bubbling" and "Event Capturing" in JavaScript.</p>  <p>I have search in internet and have looked into different website but, I still have problem understanding some differences and even the basic condition.</p>  <p>As <a href="http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/24054.24057" rel="nofollow">this article</a> suggests, the event handler is created and listens for an event. </p>  <ul> <li>Does it mean that, the JavaScript functions attached to the elements inside the DOM are not event handler and they are event listener?</li> </ul>  <p>Also, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4616694/what-is-event-bubbling-and-capturing">here</a> I found the differences between "Event bubbling" and "Event capturing". Also, I have read some time ago that in <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/" rel="nofollow">dojo</a> all the events are captured by the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag. </p>  <ul> <li><p>Does it mean that there is no JavaScript attached to the rest of the elements inside the DOM?</p></li> <li><p>More precisely, is this true that if an event is going to be handled by the parent through "Event Bubbling" there is no need to add listener to the children?  </p></li> </ul>  <p><strong>What is the precise definition behind these terms?</strong></p>
