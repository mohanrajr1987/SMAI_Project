<p>I have built a dojo OnDemandGrid that has a couple columns that have editors (NumberTextBox, and FilteringSelect) so I can modify values in the grid. I have also added some validation on these columns to help make sure the values that are entered are correct. This all appears to be working fine and when I enter an invalid value I get an indication that the value is incorrect. </p>  <p>My problem is when I try to send this data back to the server. When I get the grid data with a ui.searchResultGrid.collection.data, any of the fields that are invalid have not been updated in the collection and still have their original values. My guess is that when the cell is updated and does a save it does its validation, and if that validation fails it doesn't update the collection. How can I tell that some cells have failed validation and have issues?</p>  <p>Here's how I'm defining my grid if it helps:</p>  <pre><code>require(["dojo/_base/declare", "dgrid/OnDemandGrid", "dgrid/Keyboard", "dgrid/Selection", "dgrid/Editor",          "dgrid/extensions/ColumnResizer", "dgrid/extensions/DijitRegistry", "dijit/form/NumberTextBox",          "dijit/form/FilteringSelect", "dojo/_base/lang", "dojo/domReady!"],     function (declare, OnDemandGrid, Keyboard, Selection, Editor, ColumnResizer, DijitRegistry, NumberTextBox, FilteringSelect, lang) {          var CustomGrid = declare([OnDemandGrid, Keyboard, Selection, Editor, ColumnResizer, DijitRegistry]);         ui.searchResultGrid = new CustomGrid({             columns: {                 newItemAmount: {                     label: "# of New Item",                     editor: NumberTextBox,                     editorArgs: {                         constraints: {                             min: 0.0001,                             max: 999.9999,                             allowNegative: false,                             places: 4                         },                         style: "width:90px;",                         required: true                     },                     autoSave: true,                     resizable: false,                     sortable: false,                     width: 100                 },                 newItemUnitId: {                     label: "Unit of New Item",                     editor: FilteringSelect,                     editorArgs: {                         style: "width:130px",                         searchAttr: "name",                         labelAttr: "name",                         required: true                     },                     autoSave: true,                     resizable: false,                     sortable: false,                     width: 140                 }             },             selectionMode: "none",             cellNavigation: false,         }, "searchResultGrid");     }); </code></pre>
