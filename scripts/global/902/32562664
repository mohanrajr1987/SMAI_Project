<p>I am wondering, is there an official way to specify a different widget editor for the same column in a <code>DataGrid</code> (different rows)?</p>  <p>I found <code>dojox.grid.cells._MultipleEditor</code>, but it is quite complicated and not officially supported.</p>  <p>This is for creating things like a property sheet with <code>DataGrid</code>.</p>  <p>EDIT: People seem to suggest using <code>dgrid</code>. However, I am not sure if <code>dgrid</code> has this feature.  Also, unfortunately, ... <em>drum roll</em>...  <em>horror music</em>...  I must support IE6.</p>
