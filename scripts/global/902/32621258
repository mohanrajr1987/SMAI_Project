<p>I have a EnhancedGrid Dojo with their data, but need to incorporate a filter. By using the Filter plugin for EnhancedGrid managed to filter data on the client side , but I need to do server side . I already did that send to the server and filters the process , but not sure how the data back to the view are sent , especially the amount I read that 100,300 were sent as such but do not quite understand . If anyone knows about it please , I need a single or at least some indication example because I've searched a lot and I can not find the solution. Thanks in advance</p>
