<p>I need a difference between DOJO 1.3 and DOJO 1.10.</p>  <p>In my application, we are using 1.3 version so we are planning to use the latest version 1.10. Just I got the 1.10 version from online free download then I compared the source code between the version. I find lot of differences so I'm struck with the upgrade as whether I can replace or I have to re write the code.</p>  <p>I'm not aware of the version in between these. I'm aware of my code level changes in the older version but lagging for replacement.</p>  <p>So any one can suggest me the differences. How I can upgrade my code to the latest?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance :)</p>
