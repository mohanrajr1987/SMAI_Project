<p>I have a following EnhancedGrid:</p>  <pre><code>var newGrid = new EnhancedGrid({                          store : this.resultStore,                          structure : this.resultGridLayout,                          autoHeight:true                      });  newGrid.placeAt(this.resultGridNode); newGrid.startup(); </code></pre>  <p>I have placed grid under a "dijit.layout.TabContainer" and this tab is not selected by default.</p>  <p>When the Page is loaded for the 1st time Table doesnt appear... or rather i would say a Table appers like a line.. when i checked using firebug, found that data is present however height and width of dojoxGridMasterHeader and other grid related css classes are zero...<br>  Next time when i make changes in some input parameter which changes values in grid, the table appears..</p>  <p>Tried the solutions provided in following thread, which didnt work for me: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9746946/enhancedgrid-in-a-tabcontainer-not-working#">EnhancedGrid in a TabContainer not working</a></p>
