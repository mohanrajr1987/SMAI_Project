<p>One would like the cursor to be set on the search field when page loads. Code:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;input class="search-input"   data-dojo-type="dijit/form/TextBox"   data-dojo-attach-point="searchNode"   data-dojo-attach-event="keyup: searchKeyUpEvent"   data-dojo-props="     focused: true,     placeHolder: 'Search'" /&gt; </code></pre>  <p>On page load the TextBox widget has a focus frame, but the cursor is not there.. </p>  <ul> <li>Is this a bug?</li> <li>How does one make sure the cursor is at the search widget?</li> </ul>  <hr>  <p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I will re-phrase the question: how does one set some TextBox, so when the page loads and user starts typing it will appear in that TextBox by default?</p>
