<p>Just as an example, the "dijit/layout/ContentPane". In my sample code, which I found online and have been manipulating, this appears in the body of the new ContentPane():</p>  <pre><code>new ContentPane({      region: "top",      "class": "edgePanel",      content: "Header content (top)"  }) </code></pre>  <p>My question pertains to why the term "region" is never mentioned in the Dojo API for the ContentPane. There are other examples of this, too.</p>  <p>Here is another example: </p>  <pre><code>new ContentPane({     region: "left",     id: "leftCol", "class": "edgePanel",     content: "Sidebar content (left)",     splitter: true }) </code></pre>  <p>"splitter" is never mentioned in the ContentPane API for Dojo. As far as I know, from the API, I would never even know I could specify "splitter: true" for a new ContentPane.</p>  <p><strong>So my final question is: Is there somewhere I can find all types, "region" for example, that pertains to a given function? How would I ever know that I needed to specify using "region: "top"" if I hadn't found this code online?</strong></p>  <p>Thanks guys.</p>
