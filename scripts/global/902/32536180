<p>I'm using dgrid with the <a href="https://github.com/SitePen/dgrid/blob/dev-0.4/doc/components/extensions/ColumnReorder.md" rel="nofollow">column reorder extension</a>. I have two questions here -</p>  <ol> <li><p>I see that after reordering columns, the columns are present in the new order in the <code>subRows</code> attrinute of grid (note that I'm not referring to <code>subRow</code> here). Is that the best way to get the column order or are there any alternate/better ways to do it?</p></li> <li><p>I understand that I will need to take care of saving the column order (or any other property for that matter) and restoring it. When I'm creating the grid with a saved order, what is the best way to do it? Should I create the columns in the saved order or can I create them in the standard order and then re-order them as per my saved order? If the latter is possible, how do I do it?</p></li> </ol>  <p>Thanks,</p>
