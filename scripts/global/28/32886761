<p>I know that if I use linq to sql, everything will be parametrised and sql injection safe. But how about IQueryable?</p>  <p>For example, I can cast some entity to Iqueryable:</p>  <pre><code>var myquery = mytesttable.AsQueryable(); var qText = "name="+ "\""+DynamicSearchCondition+ "\""; myquery = myquery.Where(qText); </code></pre>  <p>Then when the query is run, from trace I can see that the DynamicSearchCondition passed in is not parametrised. </p>  <p>Initially I thought this is not sql injection proof, but I then tried some examples, and just can't break this one. Does it mean it is sql injection free then (I think it is now)?</p>  <p>If that is true, will it mean all IQueryable are sql injection safe?</p>
