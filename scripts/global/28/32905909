<p>I have tried the following:</p>  <pre><code>var itemtoremove = db.ItemGroups.Single(x =&gt; x.ID == _id); if (itemtoremove != null) {     db.ItemGroups.Remove(itemtoremove);     db.SaveChanges(); } </code></pre>  <p>The query 'works' but it deletes more than one row! Any ideas? The table itself is part of a set or really terrible tables, but I've got to use them.  Can having multiple keys on a table affect what EF does?</p>  <p>Thanks folks.</p>
