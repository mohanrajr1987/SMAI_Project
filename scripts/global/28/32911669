<p>We have a jquery.jtable page that implements paging.  We noticed that the paging is not quite working.  For example, if there are 17 total items, the first page correctly shows 10 and the second shows 7. However, if there is a total of 20 items, the first page show 10 and the second shows only 8. We are using:</p>  <p>return myQuery.Skip(startIndex).Take(pageSize).ToList()</p>  <p>On the second page, the startindex = 10 and the page size = 10 and as I said above, it is only returning 8.  The culprit seems to be the .Take.  I placed an if statement just above the code with the take as:</p>  <pre><code>       if (myQuery.Skip(startIndex).ToList().Count() &lt;= pageSize)        {           return myQuery.Skip(startIndex).ToList();        } </code></pre>  <p>On the second pass, the If returns true, since the count and the pagesize are both 10.  The return here does indeed return all 10 rows of the second page.  The concern I have is that if the full myQuery set is large, this could cause resource issues.  Fortunately, this particular table contains a small row count.</p>  <p>Has anyone else encountered this and found a better solution?</p>
