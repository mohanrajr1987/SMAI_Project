<p>I have the following function in VB.net and am trying to convert it to C#, but I have having difficulty.  Could someone please help me out?</p>  <p>Here is the code:</p>  <pre><code>    Dim subset = Sheets.Where(Function(kvp As KeyValuePair(Of Integer, Sheet)) kvp.Value.Members.Where(Function(m As Member) m.MemberType = MemberType).Count() &gt; 0)     subset.ToList().ForEach(Sub(kvp As KeyValuePair(Of Integer, Sheet)) WeightByType += (kvp.Value.Members.Sum(Function(m As Member) Convert.ToDecimal(m.TotalWeight, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture)))) </code></pre>
