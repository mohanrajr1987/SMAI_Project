<p>I have got two model named "user" and "app". One user can have multiple apps assigned and an app can be assigned to multiple users. So both are connected by navigation properties.</p>  <pre><code>var users =     from u in db.Users.LoadWith&lt;User&gt;(u =&gt; u.Apps)     where u.Apps.Count() &gt; 0     select u;  foreach (var user in users) {     Console.WriteLine(user.FirstName + " " + user.LastName + ": ");     foreach (var app in user.Apps)     {         Console.WriteLine("  " + app.Name);     }                 } </code></pre>  <p>This works fine, but I would like to restrict the selected columns. But wen doing </p>  <pre><code>select new { u.FirstName, u.Lastname, u.Apps }; </code></pre>  <p>u.Apps is always NULL. How do I restrict the columns in this navigation property?</p>
