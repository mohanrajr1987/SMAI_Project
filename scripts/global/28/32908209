<p>I use Entity Framework 6, I have such database structure (simplified):</p>  <p>Transactions - Id - DateTime - ...</p>  <p>Products - Id - Name</p>  <p>TransactionsItems - Id - TransactionId - ProductId</p>  <p>As you see relation Transaction &lt;-> Product is many to many type.</p>  <p>I don't know how to group transactions by products using LINq - something like</p>  <pre><code>transactions.GroupBy(t =&gt; t.TransactionsItems.Product) </code></pre>  <p>where TransactionsItems property is navigation property generated by entity framework and contains collection of items related to this transaction.</p>  <p>I know I can iterate all products and then search for transactionItems and accumulate data, but I wonder whether is there any simplier method to achieve my goal?</p>
