<p>I have a string value in which I need to do a compare on in an IF statement. However, I need to check the compare in a List object that contains a type string, how do I go about this in one line if possible (or using LINQ)?</p>  <p>For example I was going down the lines off</p>  <pre><code>If "example" = m_listObject.ForEach(Function(x) x.stringValue)) Then ... </code></pre>  <p>Of course this won't work but I hope you know what I mean, </p>  <p>Yes, I could do it in a <code>for each</code> or a <code>for</code> but I want to use LINQ if possible.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
