<p>I am trying to add reference to <code>System.Reactive.Linq</code>. However when I browse and select the .dll I am receiving the following error message:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The project target 'NETFramework' while the file reference targets 'NETCore'.   This is not a supported scenario.</p> </blockquote>  <p>My project is a <code>WPF</code> application. What should I do to referce correclly <code>System.Reactive.Linq</code> library?</p>
