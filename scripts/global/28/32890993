<p>How would I go about looping through a nested list with Linq?</p>  <p>I have a nested list which looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>var bookings = new List&lt;List&lt;Booking&gt;&gt;(); </code></pre>  <p>Inside the Booking class are booking details, and such</p>  <p>I want to loop through each indivudal list and extract the list which is nested by using Linq, but I'm struggling to do it :(</p>  <p>I'm not sure what method i should use with Linq, i've tried using SelectMany but i dont think I understand it well enough. </p>
