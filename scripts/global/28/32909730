<p>I'm attempting to use a linq query to dynamically select records based on account id.  account id is a int column in sql server.</p>  <pre><code>var idList = new int[123, 456];   //these number change with each user. foreach (var id in idList) {       query = query.WHERE(cs =&gt; cs.pkID = id); } </code></pre>  <p>The above makes it a AND where clause.  I'd rather have it be an OR. The above idList can contain 1 to 100.  Varying with each user.</p>  <p>How can I make linq work with a OR clause.  Contains doesn't work on INT columns.</p>  <p>Would like the select to look something like this.</p>  <pre><code> select * from table where id = 123 or id = 456 </code></pre>  <p>I have a bunch of other columns that could be appended to the where clause.  Getting a dynamic OR working is giving me a headache.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
