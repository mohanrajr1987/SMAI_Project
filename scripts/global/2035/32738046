<p>I have a doubt about incorporating multiple languages into a single Operating System. For example : Windows 10 is build of C and Assembly in its core, which can be standalone or inline programs. What about the XML, C#, VB languages that is used in the OS. XML is used almost in all metro applications. How can a Kernel be the base for all such different languages? Will a OS has multiple compilers?</p>
