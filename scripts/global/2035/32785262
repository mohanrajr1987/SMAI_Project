<p>I have a requirement. My process has to fork->exec another process during one of its code paths. The child process runs some checks and when some condition is true it has to re-exec itself. It did not cause any performance issues when I tested on high end machines.</p>  <p>But will it be an expensive to call execv() again in the same process?  Especially when it is exec()ing itself?</p>  <p>Note: There is no fork() involved for the second time. The process would just execv() itself for the second time, to get something remapped in its virtual address space.</p>
