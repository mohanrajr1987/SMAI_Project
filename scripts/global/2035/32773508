<p>I am chasing a problem with pthread_setschedparam that recently popped up. I have a C++ program that calls pthread_setschedparam to set round-robin scheduling ( SCHED_RR ).<br> The call fails, returning EPERM, even when run as the root user(!) I am running under the linux kernel version 4.1.6 ( recently upgraded ). Could this kernel version have a bug  that causes this issue?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
