<p>I study network-device-driver recently. But somehow not understand free_netdev this function.</p>  <p>I have read the following link: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24380832/possible-de-reference-of-private-data-using-net-device/24411354#24411354">Possible de-reference of private data using net_device</a></p>  <p>The answer says that when free the network device, the private data will also be free. </p>  <p>After checking this function, I found that it will call the following function:</p>  <pre><code> void netdev_freemem(struct net_device *dev)  {      char *addr = (char *)dev - dev-&gt;padded;       kvfree(addr);  } </code></pre>  <p>But I cannot understand why call this function will free all the net_device memory, and also the private data? </p>  <p>Or my understanding is wrong... </p>  <p>Just wondering if someone can guide me to understand the mechanism of free_netdev.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
