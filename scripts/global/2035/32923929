<p>we were having a problem with SPI communication with FPGA and tried communication with example codes in /documentation/spi/ folder in kernel source code.</p>  <p>in my project i use spi like the example in spidev_fdx.c  ( read() write() functions ). and i'm transferring 572 bytes per packet ( 32 bit word length - 16 MHz ) which makes 143 words. when I check with osiloscope I see 144 words. and the timings are like : X___XXXXXXXX. 1 word then wait, then 143 words. CS is always low, not going high at where the delay is. I'll post images when i can. I tested and found out +1 word is sent for 40 and more words (160+ bytes). so it is ok when i send 39 words (156 bytes).</p>  <p>I changed transfer sizes in spidev_test.c and spidev_fdx.c and run same tests that I did for my code. spidev_fdx.c behaves same way. but spidev_test.c sends 143 words with no huge/extra delay between words. </p>  <p>note: spidev_text.c fills some struct and uses ioctl function.</p>  <p>any tip / idea would be appreciated if I'm missing a point here and causing this problem.</p>  <p>kind regards all</p>
