<p>I successfully recompiled and installed linux <code>kernel 4.2.0</code> on my ubuntu 15, I for the learning purposes tried to install another <code>kernel 4.1.7</code> on my machine. I followed the exact same procedure to recompile and install it. I become successful to recompile <code>kernel 4.1.7</code> but when i installed it and reboot my ubuntu and checked running kernel in it it still shows the 4.2.0 instead of 4.1.7.</p>  <p>what could go wrong in my second installation?</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The process i followed to recompile and install both kernel is</p> </blockquote>  <pre><code> 1. downloaded the kernel from kernel.org  2. made the kernel directory in home and extract kernel.tar.xz there  3. in terminal go to the kernel directory  4. run this command sudo apt-get install gcc libncurses5-dev dpkg-dev  5. make menuconfig  6. saved the .config file with a different name i-e .config_aa  7. mv .config_aa .config  8. make -j 5 KDEB_PKGVERSION=1.RIBALINUX deb-dev  9. sudo make install  10. sudo reboot  11. checked kernel version using uname -r </code></pre>
