<p>I'm developing a small toy kernel in C. I'm at the point where I need to get user input from the keyboard. So far, I have implemented <code>inb</code> using the following code:</p>  <pre><code>static inline uint8_t inb(uint16_t port) {      uint8_t ret;      asm volatile("inb %1, %0" : "=a"(ret) : "Nd"(port));      return ret; } </code></pre>  <p>I know that the <code>"=a"</code> constraint means that <code>al/ax/eax</code> will be copied to <code>ret</code> as output, but I'm still confused about the <code>"Nd"</code> constraint. Can anyone provide some insight on why this constraint is necessary? Or why I can't just use a general purpose register constraint like <code>"r"</code> or <code>"b"</code>? Any help would be appreciated.</p>
