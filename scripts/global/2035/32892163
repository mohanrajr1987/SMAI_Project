<p>Is there a mechanism to log the peripheral interactions. E.x. If there is an application running on Linux Kernel and it interacts with the physical world over UART, CAN or any other interface. In this context is there some command or tool that can log these interactions (the data transferred is not required) so that it comes handy to understand to which peripheral does the application interacts....</p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
