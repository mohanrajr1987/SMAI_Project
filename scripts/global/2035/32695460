<p>I wrote my own avstream minidriver  for video splitting.  This driver works well for MS Windows 7/8.x/10 x64, but there is an issue for x86 OS.  If I connect two and more apps(skype, Adove flash encoder and etc) to my driver, then it stops splitting.  By logs I defined the problem was in KsPinGetLeadingEdgeStreamPointer(). This function returns me a pointer to  KSSTREAM_POINTER, by using which the driver sends video frames to an app:</p>  <pre><code>void CCapturePin::PinProcess() { ......   PKSSTREAM_POINTER pStreamPointer;   pStreamPointer = KsPinGetLeadingEdgeStreamPointer( m_pKsPin, KSSTREAM_POINTER_STATE_LOCKED );   if( pStreamPointer != NULL )    {     //here the driver fills the video buffer for an app      KsStreamPointerUnlock( pStreamPointer, TRUE );   ........   } } </code></pre>  <p>The function always returns a not null pointer, if the driver works for one app. But if to connect more apps, the function returns NULL for some apps. </p>  <p>Any ideas.  </p>
