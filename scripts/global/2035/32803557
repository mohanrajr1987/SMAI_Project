<p>I was reading "Linux Kernel Development" by Robert Love. I came across a line which I am unable to understand fully:-</p>  <p><strong><code>The kernel source is installed in /usr/src/linux. You should not use this source tree for development because the kernel version against which your C library is compiled is often linked to this tree.</code></strong></p>  <p>It looks like I am unable to relate it with some very basic concept.</p>
