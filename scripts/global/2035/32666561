<p>I've read several articles about DMA, but literally all of them just say that DMA frees up the processor. I didn't get the picture that processor doesn't have to do the work, but it still let another processor (DMA controller) do the load. Until I came across Dark Falcon's answer from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29166836/how-exactly-dma-offloads-processor-controller">How exactly DMA offloads processor/controller?</a> which make me pretty happy. Still, I'm wondering how much faster DMA can do over processor transfer? Say how many microsecond difference could I get for transferring 1Mb?</p>
