<p>I successfully created an image for Samsung Note 3 by downloading the source from Samsung and AOSP and running make as instructed in the README file. But now I want to modify a device driver, and see the result in the image. This means I really do not want to recreate an entire image; rather just the modified file, which is /drivers/char/examples directory. I have tried "m", "mm", and "mmm" but I get the following error:</p>  <pre><code>sansari@ubuntu:~/WORKING_DIRECTORY$ m m: command not found sansari@ubuntu:~/WORKING_DIRECTORY$ mm The program 'mm' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing: sudo apt-get install multimail </code></pre>  <p>I have also tried to run make from the example directory and I get: </p>  <pre><code>sansari@ubuntu:~/WORKING_DIRECTORY/drivers/char/examples$ make  make --directory=src make: *** src: No such file or directory.  Stop. make: *** [src] Error 2 </code></pre>  <p>Here is what I have in this directory as well as the make file: </p>  <pre><code>sansari@ubuntu:~/WORKING_DIRECTORY/drivers/char/examples$ ls backup  examples.c  hello1.c  Makefile sansari@ubuntu:~/WORKING_DIRECTORY/drivers/char/examples$ more Makefile  lib_src := src  lib_headers := headers  .PHONY: all $(lib_src) $(lib_headers) $(lib_src) :     $(MAKE) --directory=$@     $(lib_*): $(MAKE) --directory=$@  obj-$(CONFIG_TOS)   += examples.o </code></pre>  <p>What should I do so that when I update the c source file, I can build an updated image to flash my phone and try to see the result? </p>  <p>I wonder if I remove the examples.ko, make will rebuild again. The question is would this work if I issue make just for the /examples directory? </p>  <p>Thanks, Sean</p>
