<p>I was thinking about how some kernels have technologies (i.e., Exec Shield, PaX, W^X, etc.) that are capable emulating the effects of the NX bit present on certain x86 processors and how VMware can virtualize Intel VT-x/EPT and AMD-V/RVI. Bare-metal hypervisors (usually) have some kind of virtualization functionality in the kernel, so I'm wondering if there are kernels that can emulate other instruction sets and possibly run nothing but another architecture's machine code.</p>
