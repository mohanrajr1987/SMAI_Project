<p>I have looked at other similar questions around stackoverflow, but it doesn't seem to work for me. I am trying to compile a code sample, and it needs these header files:</p>  <pre><code>linux/module.h linux/modversion.h linux/sched.h linux/tqueue.h </code></pre>  <p>But I keep getting errors saying that those files can't be found. I know I should add them to the kernel, but can you please guide me through the process and tell me how to get this done. Thanks in advance for any help.  The code sample can be found <a href="http://www.tldp.org/LDP/lkmpg/2.4/html/x1210.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
