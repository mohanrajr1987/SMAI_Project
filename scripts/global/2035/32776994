<p>Actually one of the concepts that I don't really understand is the 'kernel porocess' or kernel thread. Searching in the web and for similar questions in SOO I found the following: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9481055/what-is-a-kernel-thread">What is a Kernel thread?</a> where the answer was: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>A kernel thread is a kernel task running only in kernel mode</p> </blockquote>  <p>As far as I know a process to go into 'kernel mode' has to issue a system call. So I don't understand how these threads are running in this mode all the time. Can somebody help me to understand how this works?</p>
