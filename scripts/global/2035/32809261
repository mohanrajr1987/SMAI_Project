<p>Recently I installed Centos 7 on my Acer Aspire E1-510. Till then touchpad doesn't work correctly: jumping mouse cursor and bad sensitivity. Also external mouse is working good.</p>  <p>I also tried to change settings with "Gnome GUI->Setting->Mouse and touchpad", and methods described <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/198729/touchpad-not-working-on-an-acer-one-725">here</a>, but it didn't help me.  Besides all it's system message about kernel problem, that "shouldn't been recorded", cause "kernel has been tainted(flags:GW)".  Before Centos, I had Linux Mint and Windows 8 installed - and touchpad worked good.</p>  <p>What should I do? </p>
