There are few questions which creates more confusion to me?</p>  <ol> <li>When the process is added in <code>cfs_rq</code>, after execution or before execution?</li> <li><code>cfs_rq</code> is made up of RB-tree, so curr of cfs_rq point to leftmost node of tree or leftmost node and currently running node are two different one?</li> <li>What is the use of min_virtual time in cfs? is it only used while sleeping and waking up of taks? </li> </ol>
