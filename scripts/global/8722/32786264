<p>II would like to create table in jasper iReport with every cells having different queries(data-sets). </p>  <p>I am able to do by creating different tables with limiting to one cell and merging the multiple tables in Detail component. But looks like its not a optimal solution. </p>  <p>In short, I wanted to fill each cell with different query in a given table. Is that possible?</p>  <p>Following code is written for two data-sets for two different tables:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;subDataset name="cell1" uuid="86ffe7f4-2494-40e4-bbc4-4c788e89ac8c"&gt; &lt;queryString&gt;         &lt;![CDATA[SELECT id         FROM patientbill        where id = 463     &lt;/queryString&gt;     &lt;field name="id" class="java.lang.Integer"/&gt; &lt;/subDataset&gt; &lt;subDataset name="cell2" uuid="66267ea4-db72-4a56-ae9f-a2d3be11a851"&gt;     &lt;queryString&gt;         &lt;![CDATA[SELECT billnumber   FROM patientbill   where id = 463     &lt;/queryString&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Any help is highly appreciated!</p>  <p>Thank you!</p>
