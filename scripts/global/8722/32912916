<p>I am using DynamicJasper and I want to add a autotext with the count of registers in the report.</p>  <p>I know that I can access the information in the variable REPORT_COUNT.</p>  <p>I would like something like this:  report.add(variables.get("REPORT_COUNT");</p>  <p>Is that possible?</p>  <p>I need this because I am going to put the count in a subreport. In the master report, I could do manually by getting the size of the list.</p>
