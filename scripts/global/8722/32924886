<p>Hello <Br>I am working with JasperStudio and i created some fields to be filled by <code>JRTableModelDataSource()</code> , now it is working correctly filling the data but not under each other , there seems to be a white space in between every row of the <code>Jtable</code> described in this photo link : <a href="http://postimg.org/image/j37md79jh/" rel="nofollow">http://postimg.org/image/j37md79jh/</a> . Now after some research , i tried adding the fields to a frame container but the same problem persisted . <br> Any help will be appreciated . Thank you.<br></p>  <p><a href="http://s1.postimg.org/xno9cxa33/Screenshot_22.png" rel="nofollow">Field Preference image</a></p>
