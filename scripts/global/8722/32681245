<p>I am afraid I am overthinking this but I am having issues using a variable in my pie chart "increment expression".</p>  <p>All I want is this: $F{dataAsOfDate}==$V{maxDate} but it doesn't work. Instead it still pulls in all the records as if this filter is not in place. The only thing I can think of is that it is evaluating the variable on every row. There are a total of 12 dates in the datasource and I am only wanting the pie chart to use data for the most recent date.</p>  <p>I am only using the summary band with a pie chart and one other column/line combo chart. The pie chart has a reset type of "Report" and an increment type of "None". </p>  <p>Version: Jaspersoft Studio Professional 6.1</p>  <p>Datasource: CSV file</p>  <p>maxDate variable: Calculation is "Highest" of the dataAsOfDate values. Increment type is "Report" and a Reset type of "None"</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
