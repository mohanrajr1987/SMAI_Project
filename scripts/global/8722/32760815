<p>I have written following stored procedure to test procedure call from iReport designer.</p>  <p>Stored Procedure:</p>  <pre><code>CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE test(cursor1 out sys_refcursor) IS   BEGIN     OPEN cursor1 for        select person_id,first_name       from person       where rownum &lt; 5;   END;  </code></pre>  <p>In my query window I am using following line to call this procedure.</p>  <pre><code>{call test($P{cursor})} </code></pre>  <p>where $P{cursor} is a parameter with class java.sql.ResultSet.</p>  <p>I have added ojdbc.jar file into my class path and connection is also successful.</p>  <p>When I run above statement for calling stored procedure it throws the error:</p>  <pre><code>Error: java.sql.SqlException:Invalid column type </code></pre>  <p>Can someone tell me what I did wrong here? Am i supposed to add any file or make any changes in the call to stored procedure?</p>
