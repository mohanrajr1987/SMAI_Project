<p>I'm new to Jasper Reports.I was able to generate a report successfully with SQL query embedded inside the jrxml file. (I'm using JasperStudio plugin for eclipse)<br><br> But now I want to use my bean class as a datasource. Need some help in getting started -<br> <strong>Requirement :</strong> User-enters values in the Donation Receipt form on screen. Persist DonationReceipt bean in the database and generate a Donation receipt pdf with the bean values.<br> <p> 1. Created a new Data Adapter of "Collection of JavaBeans" type -<br><br> <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/7bduA.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/7bduA.jpg" alt="Select Adapter type"></a> <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/yLdyZ.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/yLdyZ.jpg" alt="Created a new Data Adapter"></a><br></p>  <ol start="2"> <li>I created a static method in my bean class "createBeanCollection" as mentioned in the Data Adapter Wizard.<br> <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/VoBFK.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/VoBFK.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a> <br> Most references on the internet show hard-coded values being set into the bean, within the createBeanCollection() method. How do I use my bean with values determined at runtime instead of hardcoding.?<br><br></li> <li>I need to generate multiple receipts and reports in my application, each mapping to a different bean. e.g. WeeklyRevenueReport, DonationReceipt etc.<br> Do I need to create a data adapter for each one? Or a single adapter can be used for multiple types of report generation using different bean types?</li> </ol>
