<p>I have jaspersoft iReports Designer 4.7.1, i have a static field "Date Validated:" and a text field "$P{DATE_VALIDATED}" which i can confirm is "" empty. i want to hide "Date Validated: " text when $P is empty.</p>  <p>I have tried the following so far:</p>  <p>I have added the following line in the property (print when expression) of the static field which has static text "Date Validated: "  :  $P{DATE_VALIDATED} == "" ? new Boolean(false) : new Boolean(true)</p>  <p>I also tried the following variations:</p>  <p>$P{DATE_VALIDATED} == "" ? "" : "Date Validated:"</p>  <p>$P{DATE_VALIDATED} == "" ? Boolean.FALSE : Boolean.TRUE</p>  <p>But static field is still showing up. I also tried putting just Boolean.FALSE to hide it completely to test and see but text is still showing up...</p>  <p>I'm new to java world and jasper ireports so not sure if i have to do something else rather than just saving the report and expect it to work.</p>
