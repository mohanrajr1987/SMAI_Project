<p>we are generating jasper batch reports, where group of dynamic reports of various sizes needs to be generated. by sizes i mean a report can be 2 pages or 3 pages or any number of pages based on the content.</p>  <p>since we are generating these reports in a bulk. the numbering has been a problem. after one report is generated the page number should of the next report should come back to 1. but jasper is treating as a contagious reports and giving undesired page numbers.</p>  <p>how to identify that generation one document has ended and set the next documents page number to initial value.</p>  <p>need some suggestions to solve this problem.</p>
