<p>I have Created a Student Information Report using Jasper report (SQL database). I need to filter the report using different parameters. e.g </p>  <p>Branch Wise Gender Wise Class Wise  Section Wise and some more</p>  <p>I'm using Java Swing as a front end application. </p>  <p>My question is for each filter i have to write separate query?? or is there a way in jasper to manage different filter for example. </p>
