<p>I am having trouble creating path reference in shell scripts.</p>  <hr>  <p>I have 1 parent folder, which has 2 child folders.</p>  <pre><code>Directory Structure =&gt;  Parent     |     -- Child1 (contains shell script start)     |     -- Child2 (contains python files) </code></pre>  <hr>  <p>Now inside <code>Child1</code>, I have <code>start.sh</code> </p>  <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash /usr/bin/python ../Child2/code1.py </code></pre>  <hr>  <p><strong>Problem :</strong> </p>  <p>When I <code>cd</code> into <code>Child1</code> and run the <code>start.sh</code>, it works perfectly. </p>  <p>But when I run <code>start.sh</code> from anyother directory (say <code>/home/</code>), the relative path reference in the shell script complains. It says <code>No file found</code>, and this is because it is using <code>/home/</code> and using that as relative path. I have tested this by doing an <code>echo $pwd</code></p>  <p>I have tried `$pwd' &amp; '$cwd'. It does not help.</p>  <p>My aim is to have this shell script to work from anydirectory. How can I achieve this?</p>  <hr>  <p>Looking forward to some help here. I would be happy to add more information if needed.</p>
