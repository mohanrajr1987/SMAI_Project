<p>My question is about permissions and ownership settings for my custom shell scripts and the custom shell script directory itself. This is only for security on my personal machine, but I'd like to know best practices for any situation.</p>  <p>My script directory is /usr/local/scripts/</p>  <ul> <li><p>Should I give myself write privileges to my own scripts? Or should root be the only one?</p></li> <li><p>Should everyone else have read-only permission?</p></li> <li><p>Should root have ownership over any of my scripts/directory?</p></li> </ul>  <p>I'm still learning UNIX permissions, so trying to wrap my head around the implications of certain files having certain permissions still eludes me to an extent. Thanks in advance.</p>
