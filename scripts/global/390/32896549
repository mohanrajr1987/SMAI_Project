<p>I'm writing a shell program using while commands to prevent division by zero and to exit the program when the user types 99. Everytime i run it i get an error for the input of the second number which in turn does not give me the answer. Below is my attempt at this problem:</p>  <pre><code>#!/bin/bash firstNum=0 secondNum=0 answer=0 while true firstNum != 99, secondNum != 99 do read -p "Enter first number" firstNum read -p "Enter second number" secondNum echo "first num $firstNum" echo "second Num $secondNum" if ["$secondNum" = "0"] then     exit 1 else     echo "first number / second Number = $((firstNum/secondNum))"     echo "Answer = $answer" fi do  exit done </code></pre>  <p>And the following is the error message that i get</p>  <pre><code>./example.sh: 10: ./example.sh: [2: not found </code></pre>  <p>Any help at all is greatly appreciated. Thanks</p>
