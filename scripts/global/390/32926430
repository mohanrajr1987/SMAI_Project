<p>I'm trying to add IP addresses blacklisted by the PF firewall to a log so we have a record of them over time, preferably with the date/time they were added.</p>  <p>The following command shows the IP addresses I'd like to capture:</p>  <pre><code>% pfctl -t bruteforce -T show No ALTQ support in kernel ALTQ related functions disabled    1.2.3.4    2.3.4.5 </code></pre>  <p>But the first two lines (No ALTQ support in kernel, ALTQ related functions disabled) need to be stripped out, and I'm having no luck with awk, sed, or tail doing that. I'd think the following might work, but no joy:</p>  <pre><code>% pfctl -t bruteforce -T show | sed 1,2d No ALTQ support in kernel ALTQ related functions disabled </code></pre>  <p>And I'm also wondering then how best to weave this into an if/then statement so that only when there are results (I.e. any IP addresses), this is then written to the log, preferably with the date/time they were added.</p>  <p>Apologies for being such a greenhorn with this -- any ideas or help is much appreciated.</p>  <p>Dan</p>
