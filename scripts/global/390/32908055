<p>I have a compute engine instance and the start-up script to it includes the following lines.</p>  <pre><code># Get the application source code from the Google Cloud Repository. # git requires $HOME and it's not set during the startup script. export HOME=/root git config --global credential.helper gcloud.sh git clone https://source.developers.google.com/p/$PROJECTID /opt/app </code></pre>  <p>This code tells the VM to get source code from the cloud repository, my application code. Whenever I modify my sourcecode and push the changes to the repository and re-start my vm, the vm isn't executing the new code. How would I make the vm run the new code without deleting the instance and creating a new one?</p>
