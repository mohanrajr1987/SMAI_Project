<p>I have written this simple script for matching in shell script</p>  <pre><code>file_name="xyz_abc_diagnostics.wifi2.2015-07-30.12-30-52.tar.gz" chk_regex=".*\.\d+\-\d+\-\d+\.\d+\-\d+\-\d+.*" if [[ "$file_name" =~ $chk_regex  ]];then echo "in obs regex" else echo "dont triggered" fi </code></pre>  <p>I have checked this regex in java and here it is working fine. my syntax is right because when i use </p>  <pre><code>.* </code></pre>  <p>it is working fine. For shell script regex testing i have use this site <a href="http://regexraptor.net/" rel="nofollow">http://regexraptor.net/</a> to check it also don't matching but in <a href="https://regex101.com/" rel="nofollow">https://regex101.com/</a> which uses java regex it matches. I am not able to understand why it is failing in shell script. Is there any difference in shell script regex?If yes then please suggest me what changes i have to make</p>
