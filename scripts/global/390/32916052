<p>Some of my Python shell scripts are newly throwing security errors under Apple OSX 10.11, El Capitan. It seems the new App Transport Security doesn't like how the scripts are calling HTTP resources in plain text, rather than using HTTPS.</p>  <pre><code>Fetching http://blahblah.com     Python[5553:5648168] App Transport Security has blocked a cleartext HTTP (http://)  resource load since it is insecure. Temporary exceptions can be configured  via your app's Info.plist file. </code></pre>  <p>How might I go about fixing this? There is no HTTPS resource I can call, so I'm stuck with HTTP. The advice from Apple is to make an exception in the app's info.plist file, but this is a Python script invoked from a shell script, so there is no info.plist file to be edited. </p>  <p>Ideas? The root problem seems to be with webkit2png, which is in Python. Its non-HTTPS requests are being blocked by ATS, and there is no info.plist to modify.</p>
