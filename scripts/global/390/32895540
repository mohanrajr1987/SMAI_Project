<p>I have a line of more than 70.000 lines and 11 columns. The 4th column is a position. I want to count each line that has a position that is 100 higher than the position in the above line and a 100 lower than the position in the below line.</p>  <p>I would like to do this without importing the data to R, so I can put into my shell script. I am however not that experienced in shell.</p>  <p>Example of data:</p>  <pre><code>x    y    z    1 x    y    z    80 x    y    z    200 x    y    z    310 x    y    z    390 x    y    z    500 x    y    z    830 </code></pre>  <p>I want to count the 3rd and the 6th rows as their value in the 4th column is fulfilling my requirements, so my output here should be "2".</p>  <p>I have tried to search for information on how to do this but have been stuck for some time now.</p>
