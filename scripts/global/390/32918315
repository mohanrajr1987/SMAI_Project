<p>Based on information for a given file <code>test.txt</code>, I hope to get a pid and its executable path for a process that is operating on that file.</p>  <p>For example, if from the command line someone has run this:</p>  <pre><code>$ cat test.txt </code></pre>  <p>...then I want have something that will give output similar to this:</p>  <pre><code>process 1123 bin/cat is using /home/sam/test.txt </code></pre>
