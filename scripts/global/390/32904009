<p>I am working a project which consists of maven projects that includes subprojects. I am planning to write a shell script so that it will import all the projects into the eclipse workspace. Is it possible to import [not only for maven]projects through scripts? If yes, please tell me references or suggestions.</p>  <p>Any type of script[shell/dos/perl]. OS is windows/linux. i just want to know whether eclipse IDE supports or not.  Thanks in advance</p>
