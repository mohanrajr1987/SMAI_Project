<p>I am using Selenium WebDriver to automate the downloading of videos from a few online video converting sites.</p>  <p>Basically, all the user has to do is enter the URL of a YouTube video and the program will run the script to download the videos for you.</p>  <p>Everything runs very smoothly, but the problem is when the website fails to convert the video. </p>  <p>For example, clipconverter.cc sometimes throws an "Unable to get video infos from YouTube" error, but it works when you try again. I have done some error checking in the event that there are missing elements and the program will stop running the script but in the example I mentioned above, I want to re-run the script again.</p>  <p>What is a possible way of achieving this? Do I have to re-create the error page and get the elements presented there?</p>
