<p>Well, the code is basically</p>  <pre><code>d = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox, :profile =&gt; "myApp" d.get("http://login:password@myapp.local") </code></pre>  <p>And still firefox shows basic auth dialog window. I use the profile setting for FF so it hopefully remembers it and lets me through, but in reality it just remembers it and you still have to hit enter.</p>  <p>Kinda out of ideas here.</p>  <p>P.S. Yes, i double checked that login:password are totally correct.</p>
