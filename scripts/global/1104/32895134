<p>I have a script working with Python 3.4 and Selenium. The end result is that it clicks on a button labeled CSV so that I can open and save the page search result as a csv file. When this is clicked it opens up the save as dialog in Chrome. I want to be able to change the file name and file location. I have a similar script working for other sites and those download to the default location (downloads folder default action in Chrome) with a left-click. From there I rename the file and move it to a different folder on the PC via the script. </p>  <p>This particular site though the button uses Flash to download the file. I'm not familiar with the mechanics of how this works but there is no right-click functionality or anything like that. The only option I have within the web page is to click and then at the save as dialog rename it and select a folder.</p>  <p>I'm looking for a suggestion for a module or combination of modules I can use to do this. What it needs to be able to do is determine the current open dialog save as window and then change the name and set the folder to save to. Actually, even just being able to click the save button keeping the default name and location would be fine too. I could just rename and move it afterward. I did see win32 but I'm not sure if that's the best option. I'm on Windows 7.</p>  <p>EDIT 10/1/2015</p>  <p>Tried a few things and I can operate the save button in the save as dialog by sending a keyboard Return using keybd_event. </p>  <pre><code>    win32api.keybd_event(win32con.VK_RETURN, 0)  </code></pre>  <p>Problem now is that the default save location is not my Downloads folder when I click the button. It's an application directory where Google Chrome is. Likely some temp location. C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\45.0.2454.101. On to trying to figure out how to change the location.</p>
