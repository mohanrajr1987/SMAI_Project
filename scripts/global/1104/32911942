<p>Newbie here. I am trying to print all text(s) contained in each 'p' tag on a website. This is the code that does not work:</p>  <pre><code>from selenium import webdriver browser = webdriver.Firefox() browser.get('https://automatetheboringstuff.com/') elem = browser.find_elements_by_css_selector('p') print(elem.text) </code></pre>  <p>I am learning as I go, so I want to see the content that I am scraping, so I know all is good, before moving to more advanced topics. The teacher says "all web elements have the ".text" method, but does not seem to work when I try to print. Error message is:</p>  <pre><code>C:\Python34\python.exe C:/Users/sk/PycharmProjects/test/temperase.py Traceback (most recent call last):   File "C:/Users/sk/PycharmProjects/test/temperase.py", line 7, in &lt;module&gt;     print(elem.text) AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'text' </code></pre>  <p>What am I doing wrong and what's the solution? Thanks!</p>
