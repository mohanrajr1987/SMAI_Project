<p>I am working on a gradle project A, which my code depends on a package from other project B. I need a zip file from project A which is built daily on Jenkins.</p>  <p><strong>Q)</strong> How to handle this situation? Can it be handled as a dependency in gradle?</p>  <p>Once I get the package from Jenkins, I need to change some parameter in one file in the downloaded dependency project.</p>  <p><strong>Q)</strong> Can this be done? working on a some downloaded dependency?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
