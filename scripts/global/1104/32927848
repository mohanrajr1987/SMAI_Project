<p>I'm taking a selenium classes and I got an assignment to write a test case for gap.com website. I'm stuck with a popover that appears after gap.com is loaded. I was trying to close it by clicking the "x" but selenium couldn't find it. I was trying to find it by id and xpath but still it doesn't see it. I've attached a code. My reputation is below 10 for now so I cannot post a screenshot. So any suggestions and help will be appreciated!</p>  <pre><code>// open Firefox     WebDriver wd = new FirefoxDriver();      //1. Open http://www.gap.com     wd.get("http://www.gap.com/");      Thread.sleep(10000);      //close popover     wd.findElement(By.id("close")).click(); </code></pre>  <p>Here's the error message I get: Exception in thread "main" org.openqa.selenium.ElementNotVisibleException: Element is not currently visible and so may not be interacted with</p>
