<p>Hope you can help me, I need to click on a size button (related to shoes' size), but selenium is not able to find it with its xpath:</p>  <p><code>html/body/div[4]/div[3]/div/div[2]/div[3]/div/form[1]/div[4]/ul/li[5]/label/span</code></p>  <p>So I would like to know if I can get it somehow through its span class:</p>  <p><code>&lt;span class="attr-name"&gt;42&lt;/span&gt;</code></p>  <p>This span class is in a tree of a lot of divs</p>  <p>(ps: I would really like to post an image, but is saying I do not have enough reputation)</p>
