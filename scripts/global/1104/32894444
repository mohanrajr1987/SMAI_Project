<p>So, I am new to coding and I have been trying to get my script to run but as it goes through the pages, it gets to a point where the next page will be whatever Form page loads first and there are 11 possible pages so the order in which they appear is completely random.</p>  <p>I need to be able to tell which page has loaded and to go execute that part of the script and then once done, repeat the process until all 11 have been completed.</p>  <p>I am using the following method to break each form out:</p>  <pre><code>    testRun.testContentDev(driver);     testRun.testLandingPageEntry(driver);     testRun.testStandardSMMEntry(driver);     testRun.testDisplayAdvertisingEntry(driver);     testRun.testReputationManagementEntry(driver);     testRun.teststandardSEO(driver);     testRun.testCustomSEM(driver);     testRun.testEmailMarketing(driver);     testRun.testLocalTrack(driver);     testRun.testWebsites(driver);     testRun.testmobilewebsites(driver); </code></pre>  <p>I then have each one of those broken out using:</p>  <pre><code>    public void testContentDev(WebDriver driver)     public void testLandingPageEntry(WebDriver driver)     public void testStandardSMMEntry(WebDriver driver)     public void testDisplayAdvertisingEntry(WebDriver driver)     public void testReputationManagementEntry(WebDriver driver)     public void teststandardSEO(WebDriver driver)     public void testCustomSEM(WebDriver driver)     public void testEmailMarketing(WebDriver driver)     public void testLocalTrack(WebDriver driver)     public void testWebsites(WebDriver driver)     public void testmobilewebsites(WebDriver driver) </code></pre>  <p>One of the developers inserted a hidden input field that pulls the page information into JSON format in which there is a task name that is specific to each one. The only thing that I know of for sure that is different for each page is found in this hidden input. The taskName is the big difference and references each page specificallly. This is the HTML code:</p>  <pre><code>   &lt;input type="hidden" value=" { "formType":"taskExecutuion", "orderId":"XXXXXX", "userId":"XXXX", "assignee‌​Id":"XXXX", "taskId":"4649367", "taskName":"Landing Page Form Entry", "taskDisplayName":"Landing Page Form for: blank Order ID: XXXXXX", "rootProcessName":"Atlas - Create New Order", "rootProcessVersion":"3.0.2", "rootProcessId":"XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX", "taskP‌rocessName":"LE_Landing_Page_Entry", "taskProcessVersion":"0.10", "taskProcessId":"‌​XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" }"  name="atlas-testing-symbols" id="atlas-testing-symbols-id"&gt; </code></pre>  <p>So the main question is, how do I modify that first section so that it does not run in the listed order but in the order that they appear?</p>
