<p>I have a dropdown which is hidden at the moment it loads and with a button click it is set to visible and I can see it when the selenium is running it in the browser but still it gives me this exception</p>  <pre><code>org.openqa.selenium.WebDriverException: ElementNotVisibleError: Element is not currently visible and may not be manipulated'ElementNotVisibleError: Element is not currently visible and may not be manipulated' when calling method: [wdIMouse::click] Command duration or timeout: 47 milliseconds </code></pre>  <p>Can someone suggest how we can resolve this?</p>
