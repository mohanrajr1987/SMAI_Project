<p>After switching to Java 8 , many of the webdriver assertions fail when it tries to assert something before the element is rendered. It just seems like the speed of rendering and the Java tests isnt in sync. The Webdriver being used in the project is Selenium-chrome-driver-2.43.1. I haven't tried this for other browsers. Is there anyhow I could make this work without putting too many 'wait for elements'?</p>
