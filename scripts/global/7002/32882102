<p>I've got an issue regarding a text file I'd like to change with a batch file. I was able to trim it to this point.</p>  <pre><code>3539     78060031               523        ) </code></pre>  <p>What I need now is to get the numbers in the same line. By the way the text file is not written by my programm. What I need is now to get some backspaces till it looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>353978060031523 </code></pre>  <p>I know there is a simple solution, but since I'm very bad in scripting I can't find it. Sorry for my bad english and the bad post!  It's the first time I post something here. Thank you in advance.</p>
