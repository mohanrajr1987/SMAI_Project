<p>I'm a hobbyist programmer and am fairly experienced with batch. One thing I have found quite inconvenient is the lack of ability to trigger multiple commands from if statements for instance having to type something like:</p>  <pre><code>if %xyz% equ 2 goto change1 :change1 set /a abc = 3 goto next </code></pre>  <p>Just to set a variable as well as going to the next section. My quiestion is thus:</p>  <p>Are there parentheses in batch syntax and if so, how are they to be used in conjunction with other commands?</p>
