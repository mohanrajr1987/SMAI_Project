<p>I have the situation that I want the job done from eclipse so I use <strong>eclipse's .launch configuration</strong>. I tried to make it run <strong>python directly</strong> but got error:  <code>error 193 (%1 is not a valid Win32 app)</code>. where %1 is probably my python script.</p>  <p>I decided to create a simple <strong>batch script</strong> that calls this big wild <strong>python</strong> animal.</p>  <p>I did a lot of combinations and found this the best (batch outputs some strings, runs python, waits for it, the outputs some strings again):</p>  <pre><code>start /b /wait "Python_script.py" "%1" "%2" "%3" "%4" "%5" </code></pre>  <p>It worked until python itself started to run exe file.</p>  <p>Once again I tried a lot of combinations:</p>  <p><code>os.system([exe, arg1, arg2, ...])</code> and <code>subprocess.call(..)</code> and <code>subprocess.check_output(..)</code></p>  <p>-> I either didn't see the output in eclipse console, or the output was delayed or there was only python / or only exe's output in console.</p>  <p>finally I used <code>subprocess.Popen(...)</code> and it's nearly allright - the only defect is that the output from python script don't wait for exe's process to finish, and <strong>when I use <code>subprocess.Popen(...).wait()</code> exe passes output to console but the WHOLE output from python script is delayed until the 'exe' terminates</strong>. I want to delay only the part of pythons script output that is written after the exe is called.</p>  <ul> <li>how to achieve this 'partly console output delay' is the main topic</li> <li>advices on python and eclipse .launch configuration will be appreciated</li> <li>general advices on how does the communication between this processes(?) work will be appreciated</li> </ul>  <p>Thanks!</p>
