<p>I'm trying to run this code in cmd.exe:</p>  <pre><code>rsync -rvvv --no-p --chmod=ugo=rwX --delete --append --include=*_T_*.pdx..... </code></pre>  <p>Now i want to handle any error which appears on executing the code. I tried to use <strong>$?</strong> in the following line to get the error code but my cmd.exe told me that this command could not be found. Where is my mistake?</p>
