<p>I have cleaned and fully scanned my laptop with the help of Eset Nod32 Antivirus 6. Threats found: 2k+ and also the antivirus cleaned immediately the object. However, When I browse my Documents i found out that my laptop is indeed clean but the HELP_DECRYPT.png and HELP_DECRYPT Internet shortcut haven't deleted yet. It's very frustrating and annoying that every folder that I go the 2 files are there. I hope any user encountered with that kind of virus would help me. I would just like to have a batch-file code to loop/scan the entire C: drive and D: and delete HELP_DECRYPT.png and HELP_DECRYPT Internet shortcut on any directory or having subfolder within a folder. I cannot risk to system restore when that 2 objects still exist on any directories or folder.</p>
