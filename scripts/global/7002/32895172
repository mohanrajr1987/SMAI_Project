<p>I made a simple LAN chat batch file, and i would like to know if there is an command that checks if a specific txt file is updated. The chat history is stored in log.dat and i want to have a sound notification or something like that when theres a new message.</p>  <pre><code>@echo off title LAN chat reader call Color.bat  :read call Color.bat cls type log.dat timeout /t 3 /nobreak &gt;nul goto read </code></pre>  <p>(im a noob, please tell me if this is possible)</p>
