<p>I have this game I like to play: ryzom.com, it really wasn't built for windows and I'm running windows 10, I have to set the processor affinity each time I start the game (because the default is single 1st core) and I have multiple accounts (that i do not use at the same time, so it's always the same .exe file it's accessing). so I would like to have a desktop shortcut for each account that logs me in (username and password) and sets affinity to all cores (4 for my main computer and 2 for my old computer) for the program.</p>  <p>I know using multiple shortcuts for the login works, I can't get the set affinity to work either by .bat file or in the editing of the target string command of the short cut (probably due to operator error).</p>  <p>the default start shortcut uses <code>"C:\Program Files (x86)\Ryzom\launch.bat"</code><br> the <code>"C:\Program Files (x86)\Ryzom\client_ryzom_rd.exe" username password</code> shortcut also works</p>  <p>The .bat file noted above only contains the following string: <code>start client_ryzom_rd.exe</code></p>  <p>Any help would be appreciated (and as I'm not the only one fighting this problem, information for 2 core, 4 core, 6 core, and 8 core, and assigning multiple cores like an 8 core using only 1-4 or only even cores would be appreciated)</p>  <p>and if I can't have both at lease the affinity set to all cores.</p>
