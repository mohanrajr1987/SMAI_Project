<p>I'm trying to make a small Batch file which will start a program and change the time of my computer, and change the time back if the program shuts down.</p>  <p>My program isn't really working so I'm asking your help. Here's what I have got so far: </p>  <pre><code>:Item_1 tzutil /s "Hawaiian Standard Time"  :Item_2 tzutil /s "W. Europe Standard Time"  @echo off Start ""  "C:\Program Files (x86)\Minecraft\MinecraftLauncher.exe" set Programma="C:\Program Files (x86)\Minecraft\MinecraftLauncher.exe" tasklist |find /i "%Programma%"nul if %errorlevel% == 0 ( '%t%' == '%t%' GOTO Item_%1% ) else ( '%t%' == '%t%' GOTO Item_%2% ) </code></pre>
