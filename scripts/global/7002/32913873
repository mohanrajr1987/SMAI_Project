<p>I am trying to delete some files and folders in users' directories.  Here is what it looks like.  I have some user accounts in C:\Users\ like 'Bob' and 'Joe'.  In each of those directories, I want to delete some folders and files. So the architecture looks like this and my script now is below that:</p>  <p>I am trying to delete the files in \Temp\ and trying to delete the whole directory.  Any ideas?  I am also trying to have the script work if another user name was added.  Thanks </p>
