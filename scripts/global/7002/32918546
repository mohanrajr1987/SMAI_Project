<p>I have this command line:</p>  <pre><code> "C:\Program Files\R\R-3.2.2\bin\x64\R.exe" CMD BATCH --vanilla --slave "C:\Users\jcardenas\Documents\precios\job.R" </code></pre>  <p>It runs the script called "job", but It doesn't run all the script because the script has some (irrelevant) errors or warning messages.</p>  <p>Is there an option to run all the R script through CDM even with errors?</p>
