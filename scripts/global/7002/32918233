<p>Is there a way to make an account for a program I am making in batch? I mean, there is a way to log in with a specific username and password. But is there a way to create a username and password and make the batch file save it and remember it, so the user can login next time instead of register? </p>  <p>Hopefully you can understand. Thanks!</p>
