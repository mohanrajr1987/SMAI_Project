<p>in windows command line script I have string variable for an example:</p>  <p>AB_CD RR CRR LH 8AH_M22   1.1   2050_gra.pdf</p>  <p>which is a file name, where I need to extract to a different variable string (in this case) 2050 (user entered time).</p>  <p>It is always bounded by at least one space (usually three) on the left side, and always by _gra.pdf on the right side.</p>  <p>It is not always 4 digits long, and someone might put a dot or comma to separate hours and minutes. So it might look also like this:</p>  <ul> <li>20.50</li> <li>20,50</li> <li>20,50</li> <li>850</li> <li>8.50</li> <li>8,50</li> <li>0850</li> <li>08.50</li> <li>08,50</li> </ul>  <p>Basically is anything between _gra.pdf and nearest space on the left side.</p>
