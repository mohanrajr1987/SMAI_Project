<p>I have a pretty simple app that has one view that has a UIWebView. The header looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>@interface ViewController : UIViewController&lt;UIAlertViewDelegate, UIWebViewDelegate&gt;  @property (nonatomic, weak) IBOutlet UIWebView *webView; </code></pre>  <p>Things are working fairly well however, as I would expect, there is of course a delay between when the app launch image disappears and when the WebView content is loaded. To make this look a bit better I decided to hide the WebView when the view initially loads and only show it once the WebView itself loads, so in my controller:</p>  <pre><code>- (void) viewDidLoad {      [super viewDidLoad];     self.webView.hidden = YES;   - (void)webViewDidFinishLoad:(UIWebView *)webView {     self.webView.hidden = NO; } </code></pre>  <p>This will just show the views background until the WebView loads, however that can still take 1-3 seconds. </p>  <p>A solution I am thinking about now is to keep showing the app launcher image until the WebView loads. Naturally I would need to handle error cases and such, but I'm thinking this may make for a better experience than just seeing the background color for a couple of seconds. Googling around I'm not seeing if this is possible, however I feel like it should be. </p>  <p>Could anyone give me some insight into this? Is it possible to configure the launch image to stay until you programmatically hide it? Is this even a solid approach? Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks much!</p>
