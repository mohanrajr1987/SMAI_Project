<p>I'm trying to add Dropbox basic support to an iOS app. I've added the "Chooser" DropBox drop-in without problem but I'm getting an "error": "Origin does not match any app domain" using "SaveTo" drop-in from javascript code running in a UIWebView.</p>  <p>It seems "SaveTo" drop-in expects a public URL and needs to register the domain but I'd need to save a local file stored in the device. Is there anything I can do or I'm forced to use the dropbox API?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
