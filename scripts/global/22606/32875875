<p>I am a very experienced Android dev but very new to iOS dev using swift. Write now I have setup a UIWebview and a NSURLProtocol using canInitWithRequest (2 separate swift files). The canInitWithRequest method works great but I need to acccess the UIWebview object in order to call functions on the UIWebview object. </p>  <p>For example. if request == google.com then UIWebview.something(). </p>  <p>In Android in order to talk with the Main activity thread I just simply create a interface, implement it in my main thread and now I have access to everything on that main activity class.</p>  <p>Thanks for any help.</p>
