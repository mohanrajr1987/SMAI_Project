<p>I'm trying to create a simple iOS app that focuses on displaying webpages.  Right now I'm using Objective C in XCode.  If there's an easier solution using Swift, I wouldn't mind -</p>  <p>I'm successfully able to display a website with the UIWebView. I want to have it such that certain (external) links will open in a "new" window.  Perhaps the solution is that a dynamic UIWebView is created, with the page in it.  The thing is, I'll eventually have to be able to close this newly created window/UIWebView, revealing the original website.</p>  <p>I tried adding a "target" to my anchor tag to specify that it should open in a new/blank window, but that didn't work.</p>  <p>Does anyone have sample code or know of a tutorial?  Thanks in advance :)</p>
