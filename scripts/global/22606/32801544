<p>Comments <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7708342/ios-safari-support-plugins">here</a> state "As of iOS 9, browser plugins are supported" however I haven't been able to find a real reference.</p>  <p>Is it possible to package a C++ NPAPI plugin in an iOS 9 iPhone app? We have a <a href="http://www.firebreath.org" rel="nofollow">firebreath</a> plugin we would like to use in conjuncture with a UIWebView.</p>
