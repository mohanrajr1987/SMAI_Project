<p>I have a UIWebView that opens and directs to Twitters Oauth/Authorize webpage. The user signs in with there Twitter details and authenticates the use of our application with there Twitter account. This process worked perfect before the release of Twitter 6.37 iOS application. What happens now is when the WebView detects <a href="https://twitter.com/oauth/authorize?oauth_token" rel="nofollow">https://twitter.com/oauth/authorize?oauth_token</a> instead of staying in the WebView it opens the native Twitter application and dies. If you uninstall the Twitter application everything works as usually it staying within the WebView. How can I prevent this from happening? I want to stay within my UIWebView and not automatically open deep links. I have been reading about the new URL deep link changes in iOS 9, but not sure of how to stop them from my application to other native applications. Thanks for any help!</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/aF1Lq.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/aF1Lq.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
