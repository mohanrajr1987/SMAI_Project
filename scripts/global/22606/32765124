<p>Just updated to Xcode 7 and iOS 9 SDK and found a problem when playing the HTML 5 video in the UIWebview. The code is very simple, just load an HTML code in the UIWebview and play it. The HTML code includes a  tag to play the video file in bundle. When testing it on iPhone, the video can play properly in a fullscreen mode (as default), but the Xcode console displays an long list of error message:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>UIWebviewVideoTest[22503:904174] Unable to simultaneously satisfy constraints.       Probably at least one of the constraints in the following list is one you don't want. Try this: (1) look at each constraint and try to figure out which you don't expect; (2) find the code that added the unwanted constraint or constraints and fix it. (Note: If you're seeing NSAutoresizingMaskLayoutConstraints that you don't understand, refer to the documentation for the UIView property translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints) </p>      <p>(</p> </blockquote>  <pre><code> "&lt;NSAutoresizingMaskLayoutConstraint:0x7f8df9da8ed0 h=-&amp;- v=-&amp;- _UIBackdropContentView:0x7f8dfc034370.width == _UIBackdropView:0x7f8df9c4ec70.width&gt;", "&lt;NSLayoutConstraint:0x7f8df9d974e0 H:|-(14)-[UILabel:0x7f8df9c45b40'Slide your finger down to...']   (Names: '|':_UIBackdropContentView:0x7f8dfc034370 )&gt;", "&lt;NSLayoutConstraint:0x7f8df9d96900 H:[UILabel:0x7f8df9c45b40'Slide your finger down to...']-(14)-|   (Names: '|':_UIBackdropContentView:0x7f8dfc034370 )&gt;", "&lt;NSLayoutConstraint:0x7f8df9d835c0 H:|-(0)-[_UIBackdropView:0x7f8df9c4ec70]   (Names: '|':UIView:0x7f8df9c52bf0 )&gt;", "&lt;NSLayoutConstraint:0x7f8df9d83610 H:[_UIBackdropView:0x7f8df9c4ec70]-(0)-|   (Names: '|':UIView:0x7f8df9c52bf0 )&gt;", "&lt;NSLayoutConstraint:0x7f8df9d83910 H:|-(0)-[UIView:0x7f8df9c52bf0]   (Names: '|':AVAlphaUpdatingView:0x7f8df9c44190 )&gt;", "&lt;NSLayoutConstraint:0x7f8df9d83960 H:[UIView:0x7f8df9c52bf0]-(0)-|   (Names: '|':AVAlphaUpdatingView:0x7f8df9c44190 )&gt;", "&lt;NSLayoutConstraint:0x7f8df9daf950 'UIView-Encapsulated-Layout-Width' H:[AVAlphaUpdatingView:0x7f8df9c44190(0)]&gt;" </code></pre>  <blockquote>   <p>)</p>      <p>Will attempt to recover by breaking constraint </p> </blockquote>  <pre><code>&lt;NSLayoutConstraint:0x7f8df9d96900 H:[UILabel:0x7f8df9c45b40'Slide your finger down to...']-(14)-|   (Names: '|':_UIBackdropContentView:0x7f8dfc034370 )&gt; </code></pre>  <blockquote>   <p>Make a symbolic breakpoint at UIViewAlertForUnsatisfiableConstraints to catch this in the debugger.

It seems the error is associated with the fullscreen video play in a UIWebview. Does anyone know why this error message was generated and how to avoid it? Thanks!</p>
