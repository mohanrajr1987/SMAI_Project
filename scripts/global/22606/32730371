<p>I want to create an app like instagram, but im not sure what Instagram Uses to show their posts in home, i think is an custom table view with and UIWebview that calculates the height of all the content, that includes the comments and the image/video, Can someone help me to solve this? Which UI Control think they are using or help me to find a way to look very similar to Instagram.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
