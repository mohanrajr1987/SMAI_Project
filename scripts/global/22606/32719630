<p>We have a bug in our app that loads UIWebView with Javascript. We use <code>window.location</code> to pass data to the UIWebView and it doesn't work anymore in ios9.</p>  <p>It's very similar to the AngularJS bug at <a href="https://openradar.appspot.com/22186109" rel="nofollow">https://openradar.appspot.com/22186109</a> and <a href="https://gist.github.com/IgorMinar/863acd413e3925bf282c" rel="nofollow">https://gist.github.com/IgorMinar/863acd413e3925bf282c</a> but we don't use Angular.</p>  <p>Our analysis shows the problem is communication between the app and UIWebView. We use <code>stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromString:@"window.location"</code> and it seems to be an issue.</p>  <p>We opened a ticket to Apple Developer Technical Support but they kindly suggested us to submit a bug report. </p>  <p>Currently our app doesn't work and we need to find a workaround to solve the situation.</p>
