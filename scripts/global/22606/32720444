<p>I have an app that loads a remote <code>HTML</code> page, from a <code>https://</code> location, in a <code>UIWebView</code>. The problem is that the <code>HTML</code> page is loaded, but it is a cached version. I forgot to turn off the cache. I need the users to see the latest version of the <code>HTML</code> page.</p>  <p>My questions are:</p>  <ol> <li>Does the <code>UIWebView</code> clear its cache regularly? If so, how often is this? (If this is the case, then I don't really have to worry. My users will eventually see the new page.)</li> <li>If the <code>UIWebView</code> does not clear it's cache, is there a way I can force it to reload by changing some settings on my <code>HTML</code> page?</li> <li>Or is releasing a whole new version, with cache-clearing, the only solution to my problem?</li> <li>Also, this problem occurred on 2 <code>iOS 9</code> devices. I don't have access to a device with <code>iOS 8</code> so I'm not sure if this problem occurs there as well. Could this be an issue related to <code>iOS 9</code>? I know that they have some web security updates in it.</li> </ol>  <p>The current version of the app on the app store is built with the <code>iOS8 SDK</code>.</p>  <p>Any pointers are greatly appreciated.</p>
