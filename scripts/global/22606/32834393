<p>Before swift 2, the code below used to work. However after upgrading to Swift 2, my code below no longer worked. I had verified with Postman and RESTClient that my web services worked. </p>  <pre><code>let url = NSURL(string: "https://")         let mutableURL = NSMutableURLRequest(URL:url!)         mutableURL.HTTPMethod = "POST"         let str = "user_id=90031963"         mutableURL.HTTPBody = str.dataUsingEncoding(NSUTF8StringEncoding)         leaderboardWebView.loadRequest(mutableURL) </code></pre>  <p>Any comments and feedback will be very much appreciated. </p>  <p>Cheers</p>
