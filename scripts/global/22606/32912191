<p>I have a hybrid app that uses a UIWebView to load an ajax/multi-step form from a server. Each step sends an ajax request to the server and receives an appropriate response from the server based on the previous steps input. On the last step, I'd like to be able to process the response and use that information in my app for various things. Using Swift, what is the best way to go about achieving this? I obviously can get the initial response when the page loads using NSURLCache, but I can't seem to figure out how to grab the responses that are being received between ajax steps. Any ideas? </p>
