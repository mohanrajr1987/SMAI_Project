<p><a href="http://www.belote-rebelote.fr/a.PNG" rel="nofollow">Visual Glitch Sample</a></p>  <p>The right-hand-side token ('PLI') has two identical sides.</p>  <p>When it's applied a css transform rotateX(180deg), the red tokens (and only the red ones) on it's left side are turning blue which is unexpected.</p>  <p>The problem occurs only in the iOS9 webview of a Cordova app.</p>  <p>Has anyone ever encountered that kind of problem?</p>  <p>I don't know where to report this issue.</p>  <p>King Regards</p>
