<p>I've tried the following code to take a screenshot of a UIWebView whose bounds are larger than that of the screen (for example, around 1200pts), however the screenshot always comes out as the top part of the web view, stretched vertically downwards to cover the whole rect that it's supposed to draw. Any ideas? I could do it using -renderInContext:, but that's a slower and outdated method. Here's my current code:</p>  <p><code>    UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptions(view.bounds.size, view.opaque, scale);     [view drawViewHierarchyInRect:view.bounds afterScreenUpdates:YES];     UIImage *img = UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext();     UIGraphicsEndImageContext();     return img;</code></p>
