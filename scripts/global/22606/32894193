<p>While working on making our website responsive, I implemented a menu system along the lines of this - <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/pure-css-off-screen-navigation-menu/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sitepoint.com/pure-css-off-screen-navigation-menu/</a></p>  <p>Everything was going swimmingly until we updated our test iPhone 6 from iOS 8 to iOS 9. Safari continues to work properly, but Chrome and our app which uses a UIWebView, will not render the slide transition, unless I go in and manually toggle something using the Safari web inspector. </p>  <p>I have tried the suggestions from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32708496/safari-on-ios-9-does-not-trigger-click-event-on-hidden-input-file">Safari on iOS 9 does not trigger click event on hidden input file</a>, but it had no effect. </p>  <p>I also know about the javascript location/hash bug, but am not sure if that is something that is related.</p>  <p>Has anyone encountered something like this, and found a way around it or a way to fix it? Updating to Safari Web View is currently not an option.</p>
