<p>I'm using a <code>UIWebView</code> to load a website in my iOS app. After updating to iOS 9 and building the app accordingly the website still loads fine from my server, but fails to load the css and js files of bootstrap from cdnjs (e.g. <a href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/3.3.5/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="nofollow">https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/3.3.5/css/bootstrap.min.css</a>).</p>  <p>I assume this is related to the new ATS but so far I failed to figure out why it fails to load files from cdnjs (they support TLS 1.2 and plenty of modern ciphers) and I don't have an El Capitan with nscurl available to test cdnjs (see <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/technotes/App-Transport-Security-Technote/" rel="nofollow">https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/technotes/App-Transport-Security-Technote/</a>).</p>
