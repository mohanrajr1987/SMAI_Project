<p>Forgive me this seemingly basic question, but I have searched for a few days and cannot find official documentation stating what actually happens when a web page is launched from a home page link on an iPad.</p>  <p>JavaScript Performance tests on iOS 8.3 (ex: <a href="http://www.mobilexweb.com/samples/nitro.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mobilexweb.com/samples/nitro.html</a>) show no noticeable difference in either Safari or in a pinned app.  (~900 ms vs 3200 ms on Chrome)</p>  <p>:: So that means the pinned app is using WKWebView, correct?</p>  <p>However, there is a bug in iOS 9 (<a href="https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/12241" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/12241</a>) that is breaking our AngularJS application, and this bug only manifests in UIWebView. We can recreate the bug when the web page is pinned but not within Safari. </p>  <p>:: So that means the pinned app is using UIWebView, correct?</p>  <p>Or is UIWebView now using the Nitro rendering engine which explains both cases?</p>  <p>Thanks for your help on finding the official documentation!
