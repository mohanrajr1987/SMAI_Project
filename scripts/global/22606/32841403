<p>I have an app where all the views are portraits but only one view which is a UIWebView which loads a PDF needs to be in Landscape.</p>  <p>My project settings are below:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/pUIRH.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/pUIRH.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I have tried the following:</p>  <pre><code> override func shouldAutorotate() -&gt; Bool {     return false  }  override func supportedInterfaceOrientations() -&gt; UIInterfaceOrientationMask {     let orientation: UIInterfaceOrientationMask = [UIInterfaceOrientationMask.Landscape, UIInterfaceOrientationMask.LandscapeLeft]     return orientation } </code></pre>  <p>The above code does not seem to be working. I got the code by searching online. I am not sure what I am doing wrong. Any suggestions would be help and if you can provide some sample code would be great.</p>  <p><em>I just want to force landscape orientation for one UIWebView.</em></p>  <p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/L0Jzl.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/L0Jzl.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p><strong>Error:</strong></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/mx6hQ.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/mx6hQ.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>If its hard to read here is the error:</p>  <p><strong><em>Supported orientations has no common orientation with the application, and [KM_T_World.MainViewController shouldAutorotate] is returning YES'</em></strong></p>
