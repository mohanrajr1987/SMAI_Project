<p>since iOS9 release, my web app does not work anymore. The application uses a url hash based navigation and route changes trigger in a unpredictable way since iOS9. </p>  <p>I made a lot of researches and find the issue in the managing of window.location in IOS9 UIWebview.</p>  <p>Related to this post, the angular community seems to have fixed the issue with a released patch for angular.js.</p>  <p><a href="https://gist.github.com/IgorMinar/863acd413e3925bf282c" rel="nofollow">https://gist.github.com/IgorMinar/863acd413e3925bf282c</a></p>  <p>The issue has been identified as : The iOS9 UIWebview doesn't update the href synchronously while using window.location</p>  <p>I looked through their corrections for in IOS9 but I don't find a way to reproduce their correction to make it works with any (non angular) webapp. </p>  <p><a href="https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/8d39bd8abf423517b5bff70137c2a29e32bff76d#otherHash" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/8d39bd8abf423517b5bff70137c2a29e32bff76d#otherHash</a> @github/petebacondarwin/angular.js/commit/47f16f35c213dbb165567102231ac1496246c456 @github/angular/angular.js/blob/master/src/ng/browser.js</p>  <p>Does someone found or is working on a solution to make the angular solution work in any (non angular) web app?</p>  <p>Update:</p>  <p>This is the kind of link I'm calling</p>  <p>domain/player/index.html</p>  <p>then </p>  <p>domain/player/index.html#/online/presentation/ru1XA0nkvgHm/slide/0</p>  <p>with</p>  <p>[self.view stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromString:[NSString stringWithFormat:@"window.location.href = '#/offline/presentation/%@/slide/%ld?isNativeApp=1%@%@'",moduleId,(long)slideNumber,infoIcons,testingMode]]);</p>  <p>I made tests and found something strange.</p>  <p>If I make a double call with the last command, the second time, the hashchange event triggers.</p>  <p>I don't want to have to resubmit the app to the app store, I want to modify my html (that can be fetched from the server) to detect the hash change and make the app work.</p>
