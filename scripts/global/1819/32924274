<p>While using google maps in my android application I have come uppon a problem:</p>  <p>I want to move the camera and zoom when clicking on a textView (activates moveToSlo method).</p>  <p>The method is this:</p>  <pre><code>public void moveToSlo(View v){     slovenia = new LatLng(46.1491664, 14.9860106);     slo = CameraUpdateFactory.newLatLngZoom(slovenia,8);     map.moveCamera(slo); } </code></pre>  <p>but It says that it cannot resolve moveCamera method.</p>  <p>I am probably missing something, but I cannot figure out what.</p>
