<p>I found a gist that enables drawing tools and gives the ability to choose from a few colors to draw on a google map: <a href="https://gist.github.com/Hagith/5765919" rel="nofollow">https://gist.github.com/Hagith/5765919</a></p>  <p>I'm trying to utilize this with socket.io so that multiple people can be viewing a map, and when one person draws something onto the map, all of the people can see what is drawn.</p>  <p>I've got the basic idea down with markers by doing </p>  <pre><code>socket.emit("marker", e.overlay.position); </code></pre>  <p>When a marker is placed, however, with rectangles, polygons, and circles, it seems a bit harder. When I log out the click event on the map with any of those shapes, the data that it gives back seems way more complicated than what it gave back with marker and I can't find the coordinates for the points that I need to be able to broadcast to the other users. Does anyone know where to find these in the context of the gist above?</p>  <p>Edit: I've been able to find the center with <code>e.overlay.j.center</code></p>
