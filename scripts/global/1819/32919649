<p>I am working on an app where I have to show turn by turn navigation between source to destination. As I found below-</p>  <p>Google Maps/Google Earth APIs Terms of Service, in paragraphe 10.2 (c) it's written:  No Navigation, Autonomous Vehicle Control, or Enterprise Applications. You must not use the Service or Content with any products, systems, or applications for or in connection with any of the following:</p>  <p>(i) real time navigation or route guidance, including but not limited to turn-by-turn route guidance that is synchronized to the position of a user's sensor-enabled device.  ...............</p>  <p>It seems that Google forbids using its services (Google Directions API as one of these services) for real time navigation. So if you know some informations i'll be glad to hear them and find out if i could use Directions API for my app or i shoud find another solution</p>
