<p>I am trying to develope an app using the google maps API for android. I have followed the steps in <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-api/start" rel="nofollow">https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-api/start</a>. I am now trying to get something on screen. I have tried ARC but that seems to have problems with google play services and more recently crashs before anything else I have now been able to set up Bluestacks as an emulator for Android studio. But when I press run the app immediatly closes. how can I prevent the app from crashing on Bluestacks?</p>
