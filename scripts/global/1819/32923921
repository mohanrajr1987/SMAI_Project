<p>I Downloaded POI/Streets/Cities here in this link ><a href="http://download.gisgraphy.com/openstreetmap/csv/" rel="nofollow">Click Me</a>&lt;<br> What i want to do is Merge those 3.<br> For example I selected POI. the POI only includes Longitude and Latitude.<br> What i want is get the address of that longitude and latitude in the downloaded files(in street and cities).</p>  <p>I haven't tried anything because i really don't know what to do.  sorry for just asking, i even googled it but nothing.</p>
