<p>i'm developing an application to Android and I need to add markers every 1000metersÂ² inside a Polygon.</p>  <pre><code>public class MapsActivity extends FragmentActivity {     private GoogleMap mMap;     private Polygon poly;     private boolean isMarked;      public void btClick(){         if(isMarked){             //Add markers inside polygon here         }         }     ... } </code></pre>  <p>I need it to be equally spaced. I mean, inside this polygon i need to insert a marker every 1000meters.. Like a grid..</p>  <p><a href="https://imgur.com/orwRqY4" rel="nofollow">https://imgur.com/orwRqY4</a></p>  <p>Something like this...  each "." is a marker that i inserted</p>
