<p>I have destination places URLs in google maps like : <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/36.2687602,50.0029261//@36.2690539,50.004028,17.83z" rel="nofollow">https://www.google.com/maps/dir/36.2687602,50.0029261//@36.2690539,50.004028,17.83z</a>  and want to get my location from GPS or net and rout between me and my destination and show it in android. I've seen many tutorials but couldn't solve my problem.</p>
