<p>I am using the Google Maps API places autocomplete. I initially load the script using <code>https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?sensor=false&amp;libraries=places</code> (Note no API key) and invoke the plugin using <code>new google.maps.places.Autocomplete(input)</code>. </p>  <p>I've analysed a whole load of documentation trying to find out what the licensing is to no avail and wanted to see if anyone knows. The autocomplete is not used in conjunction with any map, necessary to note as all the documentation I've found thus far makes reference to gMaps and other services when talking about an autocomplete.</p>  <p>If there is a request limit, what counts as a request? Searching for 'London' is six characters, so is that six requests?</p>
