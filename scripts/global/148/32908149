<p>I currently have a static class that has 13 static fields, each of which is a static readonly list.  The objects in each list are of a different class, but all 13 classes extend the same class.  </p>  <p>I am finding that there is repetition in the code.  Instead of having my code get each list 13 times over, I am toying with the idea of putting the lists into a dictionary, keyed on the type.  I can replace some operations with an iteration over the dictionary.</p>  <p>I prepared a simple working example but can't get a method to return lists of the specific type. <strong>Can I make the GetList method return a List&lt; T > ?</strong></p>  <pre><code>public class ListGetter {     private static Dictionary&lt;Type, List&lt;Iab&gt;&gt; dict = new Dictionary&lt;Type, List&lt;Iab&gt;&gt;();      public static List&lt;Iab&gt; GetList&lt;T&gt;() where T : Iab     {         List&lt;Iab&gt; list = dict[typeof(T)];         return list;     } }  public interface Iab { }  public class ClassA : Iab { }  public class ClassB : Iab { } </code></pre>
