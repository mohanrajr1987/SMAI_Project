<p>I just cannot understand why this causes errors (errors shown as comments in code):</p>  <pre><code>class SomeClass {     var id = 123 }  class AnotherClass {     func myFunc&lt;T&gt;(object: T) {         T.id = 555 // Error: Type 'T' has no member 'id'         object.id = 555 // Error: Value of type 'T' has no member 'id'     } }  let someClass = SomeClass() let anotherClass = AnotherClass() anotherClass.myFunc(someClass) </code></pre>  <p>How do you get the instance of someClass after passing it into the generic function?</p>  <p>Also, I can't do any named downcasting inside AnotherClass (as you would expect with a generic).</p>
