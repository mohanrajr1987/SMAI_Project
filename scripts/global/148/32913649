<p>I couldn't think out a better title so I'm gonna try to explain it with an example:</p>  <p>I have two classes. One derives from the other:</p>  <pre><code>public class Base { }  public class Derived : Base { } </code></pre>  <p>And two interfaces. Again one derives from the other and both implement an enumeration of one of the two classes:</p>  <pre><code>public interface BaseEnumeration : IReadOnlyList&lt;Base&gt; { }  public interface DerivedEnumeration : BaseEnumeration, IReadOnlyList&lt;Derived&gt; { } </code></pre>  <p>It compiled well (although I had to implement GetEnumerator twice in the DerivedEnumeration), but when I tried to use their functions, the compiler complained about ambiguity between the two interfaces.</p>  <p>I've already tried to make a generic base interface, but then i couldn't cast to the derived interfaces from farther derived interfaces.</p>  <p>So how do I solve this problem?</p>
