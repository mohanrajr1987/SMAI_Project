<p>I'm writing a test when you get all the links from the website and click them. But I need to click some links that in the beginning are hidden or some links that appear only in other pages. Till now, I'm only got to the point that test gets all the active links from homepage and clicks them. I'm new to Selenium webdriver and java, so can you suggest how should I write the test that checks for new appearing links after clicking one or something similar?</p>
