<p>I am trying to change the language of Selenium Webdriver Firefox from English to Spanish.</p>  <p>I have the following code in place:</p>  <pre><code>def get_webdriver(attempts=3, timeout=60):   firefox_profile = webdriver.FirefoxProfile()   firefox_profile.set_preference("intl.accept_languages", "es-es")    desired_capabilities = getattr(       DesiredCapabilities, "FIREFOX").copy()    hub_url = urljoin('http://hub:4444', '/wd/hub')   driver = webdriver.Remote(     command_executor=hub_url, desired_capabilities=desired_capabilities,     browser_profile=firefox_profile)    return driver </code></pre>  <p>However, the driver being returned is still in English and not in Spanish. What am I missing? How can I set the language to Spanish?</p>
