<p>I have a set of test cases which are automated in Selenium scripts with C# using NUnit project. And I was successfully able to execute them individually. However, I have the requirement where I need to execute this set of test scripts in parallel.</p>  <p>Could you please help out with an approach for running them in parallel, something like the way it is possible for Java using Test NG xml.</p>
