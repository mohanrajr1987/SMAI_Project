<p>I'm currently doing Codeception acceptance tests and ran into the <strong>Error:</strong></p>  <blockquote>   <p>[Facebook\WebDriver\Exception\UnknownServerException] Unable to find   executable for: taskkill</p> </blockquote>  <p>The rest of the Code is working perfectly fine. It opens the Browser (Firefox) and it closes it after the tests are done, but I still get this error.</p>  <p>Google told me to add <code>C:\Windows\system32</code> to the PATH, which I did, but I'm still getting the Error.</p>
