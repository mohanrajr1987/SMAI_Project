<p>I trigger a click on a button which then opens another window (which is neither a new browser nor a frame). </p>  <p>In the new window I wish to click a button but my code is not triggering the click.</p>  <p>I tried to switch to keyword matching but it is still not working. </p>  <p>My code:</p>  <pre><code>driver.findElement(By.xpath("//span[text()='Continue to General Information']")).click(); </code></pre>  <p>â€¦which I am sure is not correct to click the button in the new window.</p>  <p>What syntax should I use to click the button?</p>
