<p>dear experts and people who are looking for answers like me. </p>  <p>I am automating a workflow that tests a “login with LinkedIn” functionality. Everything works just great when I am running my tests locally. But, when I am running tests on SauceLabs from CircleCi machine, test are failing because both (CircleCi and SauceLabs) spin up new virtual machine and hence I am getting popup “Suspicious activity … blah-blah. This computer is not recognized..” followed by random email or “Captcha” confirmation.  I understand that the very purpose of things like Captcha is to prevent automation/scripting. And I also believe that I am not the only one automation engineer, who hit this problem.  So, the question is: is there any work around ? May be Linkedin has special accounts for the test automation purpose ? Or how others approach such pain in the tail ? </p>  <p>Thank you in advance</p>
