<p>Does anyone know if Selenium PageFactory.InitElements supports Windows XP?</p>  <p>In my case, instead of Lazy initialization of WebElement it tries to find element on a page. As far as I know it should create some kind of a proxy for WebElement and search for WebElement on a page at first call to this WebElement.</p>  <p>The same code works on Windows 7 but not Windows XP. It throws NoSuchElement exception.</p>
