<p>I have built some functional tests in Selenium IDE with the aim of exporting these to run either in JUnit or similar. Running these tests inside the IDE was quite impressive, the tests I ran took around 4 seconds a test. However I have since exported these tests and run them in JUnit, and the tests are all of a sudden taking 12-14 seconds to perform. Even using a headless webdriver we are still looking at 10 second tests.</p>  <p>I have run IDE linked through webdrivers to open up other browsers and they still run much faster than through the WebDriver from JUnit. </p>  <p>Does anyone have any advice on improving the Webdriver performance so that I don't have to run everything from Firefox.</p>
