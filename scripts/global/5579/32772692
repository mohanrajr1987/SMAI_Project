<p>I would like to instantiate a chromedriver instance in my Robot suite setup but I need to install an extension upon browser startup. I'm able to easily do this at the Python level by simply adding chromeoptions to my webdriver instatiation, but I need to do this at the Robot level. I found that there IS a keyword "Create Webdriver" that allows you to pass arguments into your webdriver instantiation. However, I still cannot get an extension to install at startup. I am using Options from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options and the function add_extension. Can anyone please help me with this?</p>  <pre><code>Some_Setup     ${options}=    Evaluate    sys.modules['selenium.webdriver'].ChromeOptions()       sys, selenium.webdriver.chrome.options     ${options.add_extension}=        Set_Variable          path/to/extension     Create WebDriver    Chrome    chrome_options=${options} </code></pre>  <p>If there is a way to pass in my extension via desired capabilities, how would I format that in a dictionary? It seems like desired_capabilties has a chromeOptions field with an args:[] and extensions:[] fields avaialable but I don't know how to pass my extension to it. </p>
