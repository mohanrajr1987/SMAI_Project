<p>I've recently created a framework that successfully tests the GUI of my project. Now I would like to extend my testing by creating full end to end testing of functional tests. These tests would execute the following core steps. </p>  <ol> <li>Create Profile using the GUI ( this is done using Java selenium webdriver)</li> <li>Automating calling a unix script that is stored on a server that I would use putty to connect to and run</li> <li>After the script has ran verify expected information in the DB</li> </ol>  <p>I have already completed the first step I'm wondering should I integrate step 2 and 3 into my already existing framework? Can I do all this with Java? Is there any documentation to help me with step 2 &amp; 3?</p>
