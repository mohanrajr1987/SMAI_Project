<p>I have basic understanding of Selenium architecture, where Search Context is main interface implemented by Web Driver interface which is extended by various browser driver class. Normally, we follow POM for our selenium projects and define each object by their By class -</p>  <pre><code>By addButton=By.Id("asdf"); </code></pre>  <p>But just realized that we can even do-</p>  <pre><code>addButton.FindElement(By.XPath("ABC").  </code></pre>  <p>But this does not return element like <code>driver.FindElement(addButton)</code></p>  <p>When to use above statement?</p>
