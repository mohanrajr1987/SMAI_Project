<p>I have a test script written in python robot framework which navigates through a website and tests its pages. The website sometimes needs to refresh all its content from server, i.e. it needs a No-Cache Refresh. </p>  <p>Robot Framework selenium2library has a <code>reload page</code> method which simply performs a Refresh-If-Modified. In Python I can use <code>driver.refresh()</code> which does the same. </p>  <p>I tried <code>Press Key</code> in robot framework and <code>driver.send_keys(Keys.COMMAND + Keys.F5)</code> and <code>driver.get(url)</code> in python; none of them was successful!</p>  <p>Any idea how to do that?? </p>  <p>To clarify, a <code>No-Cache Refresh</code>, retrieves all the website data from its server regardless of its changes on the server, but a <code>Refresh-If-Modified</code> first sends a request to the server and asks for changes, then it just requests to retrieve modified data.</p>
