<p>I would like to position cubes in a rectangular/square like grid. I'm having trouble trying to create some methodology in depending on what I pick through an HTML form input (checkboxes) to have it arrange left to right and up to down, a series of cubes, in a prearranged grid all on the same plane.</p>  <p>What measurement units is three.js in? Right now, I'm setting up my shapes using the built-in geometries, for instance.</p>  <p>var planeGeometry = new THREE.PlaneGeometry(4, 1, 1, 1);</p>  <p>The 4 and 1; I'm unsure what that measures up to in pixels, although I do see it rendered. I'm resorting to eyeballing it (guess and checking) every time so that it looks acceptable.</p>
