<p>I'm attempting rotate an arrow on the surface of a planet to face the direction it is traveling. I can get the direction vector and the up vector from the surface normal. How would I go about turning this into a quaternion for my arrows rotation. I'm using three.js so any suggested methods they provided that I can use would be useful. Cheers.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/bkB8P.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/bkB8P.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>The information I have so far.</p>  <p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false"> <div class="snippet-code"> <pre class="snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override"><code>var upVector = new THREE.Vector3(); upVector.subVectors( new THREE.Vector3(0,0,0), lastVec );  var dirVector = new THREE.Vector3(); upVector.subVectors( lastVec, destVec );  var sideVector = new THREE.Vector3(); sideVector.crossVectors( dirVector, upVector );  var newUp = new THREE.Vector3(); newUp.crossVectors( dirVector, sideVector );</code></pre> </div> </div> </p>
