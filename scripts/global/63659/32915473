<p>I just updated to three.js r72 and I am getting the following warning in console concerning THREE.LinePieces ...</p>  <pre><code>THREE.Line: parameter THREE.LinePieces no longer supported. Created THREE.LineSegments instead. </code></pre>  <p>The lines will appear disconnected dispite the warnings, however, for the following example, if I update THREE.LinePieces to THREE.LineSegments all disconnected lines become connected.</p>  <pre><code>var lineMaterial = new THREE.LineBasicMaterial({color: 0x000000, linewidth: 1}); var lineGeom = new THREE.Geometry(); var xstrt = 0; for (nn=0; nn&lt;numLines; nn++) {     lineGeom.vertices.push(new THREE.Vector3(xstrt, -5, 0));     lineGeom.vertices.push(new THREE.Vector3(xstrt, 5, 0));     xstrt += 5; } var Line  = new THREE.Line(lineGeom, lineMaterial, THREE.LinePieces); // seperate lines, but with warnings //var Line  = new THREE.Line(lineGeom, lineMaterial, THREE.LineSegments); // connected as one line only :( </code></pre>  <p>Am I expected to create separate geometries (containing two vertices) for each line segment  or is it possible to merge multiple line segments into one geometry as I had with LinePieces?</p>
