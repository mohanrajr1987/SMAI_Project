<p>I am working on a webgl viewer of IFC file now. Most IfcRepresentation objects are easy to understand, however, I am not good at coordination transformation. Are there any better expression to translate and rotate an Object3D in THREEJS as defined by IfcAxis2Placement3D? I guess it should rotate the object by Z axis then align the Z axis to a new vector, how to implement this ? Another questions is about IfcObjectPlacement. It always requires a sub PlacementRelTo object until PlacementRelTo == null. I am a bit confused again, is it a forward transformation or backward transformation if I want to read the absolute coordinates from this placement? I mean, use a push-pop or a direct order? for example, if there are matrix like M1, M2.. Mn, then M = M1 x M2 x ... Mn or M = Mn x Mn-1 x ... x M2 x M1? I can find beautiful mesh objects in my project but the position is always wrong. Please help me.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
