<p>I have two meshes: mesh1 and mesh2. both have the same number of vertices and have extrusion.</p>  <pre><code>mesh1 = 5000 vertices. mesh2 = 5000 vertices. </code></pre>  <p>I assign the vertices of mesh2 to mesh1. then I do:</p>  <pre><code>mesh2.geometry.verticesNeedUpdate = true; mesh2.geometry.vertices = mesh1.geometry.vertices; </code></pre>  <p>thus the vertices of mesh2 are updated. but this happens too fast. I can not see an animation while it makes mesh2's vertices to mesh1's vertices.</p>  <p>I want to see the transformation when malla2 starts to become the malla1, I mean to see an animation of vertices when they are changing.</p>  <p>I used "Tween.js" for animations such as position and color. I'm not sure if this can help to view animations when vertices begin to change.</p>  <p>I do:</p>  <pre><code>new TWEEN.Tween( mesh2.geometry.vertices ).to( mesh1.geometry.vertices, 1000 ).start(); </code></pre>  <p>but not works. sorry for my level of english.</p>
