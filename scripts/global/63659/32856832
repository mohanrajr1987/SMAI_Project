<p>If I have a geometry, say</p>  <pre><code>THREE.PlaneGeometry(400,400); </code></pre>  <p>or</p>  <pre><code>THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({map:new THREE.MeshFaceMaterial(materials)}); //multiple textures on only one face </code></pre>  <p>How would I make it so  that I have multiple textures on the same side of the plane?</p>  <p>Furthermore, how would I go about setting the coordinates of the texture and position of the texture on the Plane (or face)?</p>  <p>It should look something like this: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/iaegt.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/iaegt.png" alt="plane_and_textures"></a></p>
