<p>I made a model of a building with 3DS Max where each room is a modified cube, I used OBJMTLLoader to load the OBJ file with his own MTL.  The problem is that I need to emphasize certain rooms according to the user requirements.</p>  <p>I use dat.gui to display a menu where the user can check/uncheck rooms to remark them (I think I will change the room size or marterial in order to emphasize it).</p>  <p>this is the code of my loader</p>  <pre><code>var loader = new THREE.OBJMTLLoader();         loader.load( 'models/h.obj', 'models/textures/h.mtl',           //onLoad()         function ( object ){             contenido = object;             contenido.position.set(0,0,0);             contenido.position.y = -80;             contenido.name = 'edificio';              scene.add(contenido);              return contenido;         } //and other onLoad, and onError stuff </code></pre>  <p>I can play with the whole model, I have a transparency function that adjust transparency to a dat.gui bar (the one called opciones.Opacidad)</p>  <pre><code>contenido.traverse( function( object ) {                      if( object.material ) {                          object.material.opacity = opciones.Opacidad;                         object.material.transparent = true;                     } </code></pre>  <p>And it works correctly, but the probblem come when I try to access internal cubes of the geometry to remark them in wireframe (for example) I use: </p>  <pre><code>contenido.getObjectByName("RoomNameIn3DSMax").material.wireframe=true; </code></pre>  <p>In order to find and show it in wireframe, because the OBJ file names every module with its 3DS Max name. But it does not work, It looks like the item is found because I don't get any error, but it does not appear in wireframe, also when I use another room names, sometimes the program show in wireframe lots of things that can include the requested one or not, another ones it finds "undefined" I think it has something to be with the Groups created by the OBJMTLLoader.</p>  <p>I've also tried </p>  <pre><code>        contenido.traverse( function ( child ) {             if ( child.name == "NameInOBJor3DSMax" ) {                 child.material.wireframe = true;             }         }) </code></pre>  <p>But the result is the same.</p>  <p>So my question is, <strong>How can I access internal modules of my model</strong> loaded with OBJMTLLoader? As you can see I tried to use the "Object3D" methods to access the internal cubes of the whole model, am I doing it correctly? I can provide all the code and files if needed, you can see an approach of my problem here:</p>  <p><a href="http://91.117.221.45/pruebas/0.1.html" rel="nofollow">3DBuilding link</a> </p>  <p>[you can also see all code there ;) (It could be down depending on the time)]</p>  <p>Thank you for your attention, I hope someone can help me.</p>
