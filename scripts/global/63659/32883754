<p>Trying to get a camera to smoothly rotate around a globe to a new position when a button is pressed. I'be done proof of position with the following to check the coordinates are OK</p>  <pre><code>camera.position.set(posX,posY,posZ); camera.lookAt(new THREE.Vector3(0,0,0)); </code></pre>  <p>However when I do the following to try to get it to tween nothing moves. Seems the .onupdate isn't being called and I can't figure out what I've done wrong</p>  <pre><code>var from = {         x : camera.position.x,         y : camera.position.y,         z : camera.position.z       };        var to = {         x : posX,         y : posY,         z : posZ       };       var tween = new TWEEN.Tween(from)       .to(to,600)       .easing(TWEEN.Easing.Linear.None)       .onUpdate(function () {         camera.position.set(this.x, this.y, this.z);         camera.lookAt(new THREE.Vector3(0,0,0));       })       .onComplete(function () {         camera.lookAt(new THREE.Vector3(0,0,0));       })       .start(); </code></pre>  <p>Any help appreciated</p>
