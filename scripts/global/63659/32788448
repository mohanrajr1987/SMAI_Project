<p>I'd like to know what fancy formulas should I apply to my code to make a car move smoothly like it should, specially when steering? I have a car object (boxGeometry) and attached four wheels to it (torusGeometry). The car should smoothly move like in an arc when steering, and wheels rotation should be bigger than the car to reproduce the same movement it does.</p>  <p>Anyone knows how to achieve that?</p>
