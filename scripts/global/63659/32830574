<p>in a Three.js app I want to get the object that the perspective camera is pointing at and to do that I read the raycaster docs. All the docs that I found talk about doind raycasting with camera and a Vector2 from the mouse coordinates, but I don't want to use the 2d coordinates of the mouse. The camera can rotate for any reason: click and drag the screen, touch control or even VR control, I just want to raycast from the center point of the perspective camera and set as "selected" the object it looks at.</p>  <p>Any suggestions?</p>
