<p>Welcome, I have a little struggle with Three.js lately. I'm trying to put some texture maps on terrain and my texture code looks like this: </p>  <pre><code>var textures = {     snow: THREE.ImageUtils.loadTexture( 'img/snow.jpg' ),     snowNorm: THREE.ImageUtils.loadTexture( 'img/snonormal.jpg' ), } textures.snow.wrapS = textures.snow.wrapT = THREE.RepeatWrapping; textures.snowNorm.wrapS = textures.snowNorm.wrapT = THREE.RepeatWrapping; textures.snow.repeat.set( 100, 100 ); textures.snowNorm.repeat.set( 10, 10 );     snow: new THREE.MeshPhongMaterial({         color: 0xaaaaaa,         specular: 0xffffff,         shininess: 8,         map: textures.snow,         normalMap: textures.snowNorm     }), </code></pre>  <p>My mesh is 100x100 simple grid  and I foolishly expected that i'd have an 100 times repeated texture map with 10x reapeated normal map over it, but all i got is 100x repeated texture map with 100x repeated normal map over it. </p>  <p>Is there any way i can achieve having normalMap and map having different repeat values? </p>  <p>Thanks in advance for help.</p>
