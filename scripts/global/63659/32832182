<p>I have a threejs r.67 application where I load skinned meshes(from sea3d) with vary large animations. tens of thousands of frames. When I remove one of the meshes and try to load a new one, I get OOM errors for recursive function. I don't have any recursive functions other than a render. I have been using the chrome dev tools to create heap snapshots, and I am seeing that the actual animation arrays are not being removed when the meshes are. Is there a way to remove the animation arrays so that I am not getting the OOM?</p>  <p>Here is a jsFiddle of what I am working with. You can load the different sea files using the Load Strength and Load Reflex buttons. After alternatively loading the files you will get an OOM. They take a bit to load, but wait until one is loaded before you load the next. </p>  <p><a href="https://jsfiddle.net/DezOnlyOne/porsu3cd/20/" rel="nofollow">https://jsfiddle.net/DezOnlyOne/porsu3cd/20/</a></p>  <p>The animated files are loaded using the <code>loadPatient()</code> function</p>
