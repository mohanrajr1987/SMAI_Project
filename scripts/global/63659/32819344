<p>I have 2 geometries and 2 meshes.  Main goal is sometimes exclude part of first geometry (so I need 2 groups for that) and show in this time part of 2nd geometry (always 1 group). Before release r72 I was use this code</p>  <p>1st geometry:</p>  <pre><code>bufCompaniesGeomNotActive.addDrawCall(0, geomCompaniesNotActive.faces.length * 3, 0); bufCompaniesGeomNotActive.addDrawCall(0, 0, 0); </code></pre>  <p>2nd geometry</p>  <pre><code>bufCompaniesGeomActive.addDrawCall(0, 0, 0); </code></pre>  <p>In r72 release addDrawCall just renamed to addGroup. But main problem is 2 group's in 1st geometry. I was trying make visible part's like before</p>  <pre><code> floor.companiesGeomNotActive.groups[0].start = 0;  floor.companiesGeomNotActive.groups[0].count = obj.startFaceIndexNotActive * 3;   floor.companiesGeomNotActive.groups[1].start = obj.endFaceIndexNotActive * 3;  floor.companiesGeomNotActive.groups[1].count = lengthNotActive - obj.endFaceIndexNotActive * 3; </code></pre>  <p>but no success.  I've found method <code>companiesGeomActive.setDrawRange(obj.startFaceIndexActive * 3, 3 * (obj.endFaceIndexActive - obj.startFaceIndexActive));</code> and it works but how can I set ranges for many groups?</p>
