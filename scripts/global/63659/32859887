<p>I'm using r71 and I need to click to raycast to a mesh (THREE.Geometry) and get the barycentric coordinates of point inside the clicked triangle on the mesh. I know there is a <code>THREE.Triangle.barycoordFromPoint (point, optionalTarget)</code> function but I don't understand very clearly how it works or if it can be applied to my case. </p>  <p>My code of one attempt in transformming the Face3 indexes obtained at the raycast in a triangle and then call the function with the point from raycast:</p>  <pre><code>raycaster.setFromCamera( mouse, camera );  intersects = raycaster.intersectObject( plane, true );  var face = plane.geometry.faces[ intersects[0].faceIndex ]; var faceX = plane.geometry.vertices[ face.a ]; var faceY = plane.geometry.vertices[ face.b ]; var faceZ = plane.geometry.vertices[ face.c ]; var triangle = new THREE.Triangle ( faceX, faceY, faceZ ); console.log( triangle.barycoordFromPoint( raycastLast[0].point ) ); </code></pre>  <p>This outputs <code>Tâ€¦E.Vector3 {x: 11.585726082148518, y: 27.99652418990989, z: -38.58225027205841}</code> that seems incorrect as the values are very big.</p>  <p>How do I can get the correct barycentric coordinates from the intersected point inside the triangle of the mesh?</p>  <p>Thank you</p>
