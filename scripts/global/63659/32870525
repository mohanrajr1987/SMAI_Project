<p>As detailed in a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32865389/three-js-object-picking-doesnt-report-parent-object-name-on-object-loaded-with">previous question</a> I have learned how to use THREE.js OBJMTLLoader by using the same objects &amp; materials used in the <a href="http://threejs.org/examples/webgl_loader_obj_mtl.html" rel="nofollow">official example</a>. </p>  <p>That example uses a (for me) complex model with the DDSLoader.</p>  <p>I would like to load simpler OBJ+MTL models and have been trying with several free models obtained from the web.  I have managed to load the OBJ files OK (by applying further THREE.js code such as defining normals) but there is a problem loading material textures from the MTL files.</p>  <p>Here is a simple example of my code.</p>  <pre><code>//...DolphinB var posX = -3445; var posY = 750; var posZ = -100;  var common_scale = 100;  var loader = new THREE.OBJMTLLoader(); loader.load(    'TRI_VP_files/models/dolphin/DOLPHIN_B.obj',     'TRI_VP_files/models/dolphin/DOLPHIN_B.mtl',      function(object)      {     object.position.set( posX, posY, posZ );     scene222.add( object );     object.scale.set(common_scale, common_scale, common_scale);      } ); </code></pre>  <p>Here is the MTL code</p>  <pre><code># Wavefront material library # Tue Aug 03 07:47:56 1999 # Created with Viewpoint Interchange www.viewpoint.com  newmtl dl_body   Ka 0 0 0   Kd 0 0.8 0.9   Ks 0 0 0   illum 1   map_Kd DOLPHIN2.JPG </code></pre>  <p><strong>My Question</strong></p>  <p>Please could someone point me to some simple OBJ + MTL files which are known to load OK with OBJMTLLoader.</p>
