<p>So I'm trying to have depth of field effect on some pixelart I made.</p>  <p>For that I need a texture with the depth information. So I render my texture on a plane using MeshDepthMaterial, but all I get is a grey rectangle, it completly ignores the alpha data in the texture (which is only 1 or 0, nothing inbetween).</p>  <p>Of course I'm using</p>  <pre><code>depthMaterial.transparent = true; depthMaterial.alphaTest = 0.5; depthMaterial.needsUpdate = true; //just to be sure </code></pre>  <p>Just for your interest this is my pixelart and how it is rendered: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/TLQOe" rel="nofollow">http://imgur.com/a/TLQOe</a></p>
