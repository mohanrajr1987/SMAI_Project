<p>I've been working on an environment that combines StereoEffect and VideoTextures. </p>  <p>I'm not able to get the video to completely cover the geometry (the interior of a cylinder <code>THREE.BackSide</code>). About 25% of the cylinder is covered depending on the video sizes in a square pattern (the videos haven't been square).</p>  <p>So the question is: does the video need to be square? Why only for StereoEffect? Or are the devices running out of memory?</p>  <ul> <li><strong>works</strong>: If I disable StereoEffect I have no issue.</li> <li><strong>works</strong>: If I use an image instead of a video I have no issue</li> <li><strong>no effect</strong>: Using webm, ogv, mp4</li> <li><strong>no effect</strong>: Using smaller, shorter video files</li> <li><strong>no effect</strong>: Using a canvas > 2d context > draw image pattern instead of VideoTexture</li> </ul>  <p>Update</p>  <ul> <li><strong>no effect</strong>: Using a square format video (say 1024x1024 for example). Covers more than 50% of the cylinder (about 70%).</li> </ul>  <p>The areas <strong>not</strong> covered by the video show random noise -- a previous window, parts of background textures. It's different every time the page is reloaded particularly when switching between windows (on a Macintosh).</p>
