<p>I'm trying to identify when a collision occurs between two meshes I've created. The problem is that one of the meshes is nested into a bunch of <code>THREE.Object3D</code> objects, so the collision isn't being detected. When I add another object directly to the scene ( <code>scene.add(myObject)</code> ), the collisions between that object and the other object at the top of the scene are recognized. However, there is still no collision detected between the mesh inside of the <code>THREE.Object3D</code>.</p>  <p>Is there a way to have Physijs detect collisions between meshes which are a direct child of the <code>scene</code> object, and meshes which are a child of a <code>THREE.Object3D</code>, which is a parent to the child?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
