<p>I am trying to build a Zigbee (802.15.4) network simulation in OMNeT++ using INET 3.0 framework (MiXiM was deprecated and replaced by this version ). The problem is that unlike 802.11, the Zigbee is not fully standardize by its Alliance, so the modules in the framework are not complete nor ready for use.</p>  <p>I searched for an example that uses Zigbee all over the web but found none that uses INET 3.0, I found some that uses the old MiXiM. The INET 3.0 was released a few months ago.</p>  <p>I also tried to build my own Zigbee node but was not very lucky.</p>  <p>Can anyone please guide me to an example of Zigbee simulation in OMNeT++ under the INET 3.0 framework, or at least a node structure?</p>  <p>I forgot to mention that I am a novice to OMNeT++ and to INET.</p>
