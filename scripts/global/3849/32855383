<p>If I define a module as such:</p>  <pre><code>module Module1 open System  let foo =     Console.WriteLine("bar") </code></pre>  <p>Then, in interactive do</p>  <pre><code>#load "Library1.fs" //where the module is defined open Module1 </code></pre>  <p>I see a </p>  <blockquote>   <p>[Loading c:\users\jj\documents\visual studio 2015\Projects\Library1\Library1\Library1.fs]   bar</p> </blockquote>  <p>Indicating that the foo function ran without me even calling it!</p>  <p>How/why does this happen?  Is there any way to prevent it?</p>  <p>I'm aware that the return value of foo is whatever (Console.Writeline("bar")) evaluates to, and that there isn't any reason that can't be evaluated "immediately?" (when the module is loaded I guess?) - but is there a way to prevent it from happening?  If my module functions alter the state of some other stuff, can I ensure that they do not evaluate until called?</p>
