<p>As I am trying to install new <strong>imc module</strong> to my kamailio sip server, I also followed the documentation of it. But unfortunately, I could not run kamailio sip server. </p>  <p>The error which is coming while running it is on this line:</p>  <pre><code>modparam("imc","db_mysql","DBURL") </code></pre>  <p>Where </p>  <pre><code>DBURL = "mysql://kamailio:kamailiorw@localhost/kamailio" </code></pre>  <p>The errors are like <code>syntax error</code> and <code>invalid arguments</code></p>  <p>What could be the possible chances of this kind of error? In last what can be the best imc testing software or client? Please help.</p>
