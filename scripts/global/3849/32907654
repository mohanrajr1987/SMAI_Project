<p>i have a question that is a little difficult to explain but i'll try my best to do so. If you don't understand anything or need more information feel free to ask. :)</p>  <p>I have a java project that uses the java plugin framework. That means i'm searching for projects with a specific structure in the classpath of my project. I have two projects which have this needed structure and are included in the main project pom.xml as dependencies like that:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;dependency&gt;     &lt;groupId&gt;package&lt;/groupId&gt;     &lt;artifactId&gt;One&lt;/artifactId&gt;     &lt;version&gt;1.0&lt;/version&gt; &lt;/dependency&gt; &lt;dependency&gt;     &lt;groupId&gt;package&lt;/groupId&gt;     &lt;artifactId&gt;Two&lt;/artifactId&gt;     &lt;version&gt;1.0&lt;/version&gt; &lt;/dependency&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I'm retrieving the available classes via the ServiceLoader like that:</p>  <pre><code>loader = ServiceLoader.load(ISomeInterface.class); loader.iterator(); </code></pre>  <p>My problem is, that the ServiceLoader.load call only delivers only the project that is mentioned first in my pom.xml.</p>  <p>Has anyone of you made similiar experiences or can help my with this problem?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance, Loris</p>
