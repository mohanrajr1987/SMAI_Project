<p>I am completely new to Firebird Database; I am working on a Firebird 2.5 database that already exists; I retrieve the stored procedures and views (database objects) from this database to develop reports in Microsoft SSRS. I use Windows 7 Operating System.</p>  <p>Occasionally (not always) I get the following error when I run some stored procedures or views (database objects) that use the LTRIM function:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>can't format message 13:896 - message file C:Windows\firebird.msg not found; invalid request BLR at offset 623; function LTRIM is not defined; module name or entrypoint could not be found; Error while parsing procedure XXXXXXX (stored_procedure name) ;</p> </blockquote>  <p>(I get this both in IB Expert and SSRS) </p>  <p>This said I am able to access other database objects that do not use LTRIM function!</p>  <p><strong>My temporary workaround:</strong></p>  <p>Sometimes I restart the machine, and am able to run these same stored procedures and views that threw this error sometime back. At other times, I restart the machine a couple of times, and am able to access these views and stored procedures.</p>  <p>At some other times, I restart the machine many times, still not able to run the database objects. I get frustrated and quit for the day. When I open the machine fresh the next morning, I am able to run these objects again.</p>  <p>What could be the reason for this? And what will be the permanent solution?</p>  <p>This database is given by my client, and am not supposed to modify anything (such as changing LTRIM to something else). I can just use the existing objects to develop reports.</p>
