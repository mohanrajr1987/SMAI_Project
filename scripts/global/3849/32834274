<p>Im New to Python coming form a C++  background, Im getting used to it by writing some programs, and this question came to my mind after reading this <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html" rel="nofollow">itertools python module</a> </p>  <p>Along the help of some other users in this page, we ended up using the permutations and combinations function in this program </p>  <pre><code>from itertools import permutations, combinations   A = (1,2,3,4) B = (4,3,2,1) n = len(A)        print("Starter point") print(A) print("Final Point") print(B)  def permutaciones(inicio, objetivo):     perms = list(permutations(inicio))      perms2 = list(combinations(A, n))      if tuple(objetivo) not in perms:             return []     Var = perms[: perms.index(tuple(objetivo)) + 1]     return Var  print permutaciones(A, B) print("--------------") </code></pre>  <p>As far as i understand Im calling the functions permutations and combinations from the library (module) itertools</p>  <p>Where bot functions are described as the 2 following blocks of code, citing from the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.permutations" rel="nofollow">itertools page</a> combinations can be described as </p>  <pre><code>def combinations(iterable, r):     pool = tuple(iterable)     n = len(pool)     for indices in permutations(range(n), r):         if sorted(indices) == list(indices):             yield tuple(pool[i] for i in indices) </code></pre>  <p>The code for permutations() can be also expressed as a subsequence of product(), filtered to exclude entries with repeated elements (those from the same position in the input pool):</p>  <pre><code>def permutations(iterable, r=None):     pool = tuple(iterable)     n = len(pool)     r = n if r is None else r     for indices in product(range(n), repeat=r):         if len(set(indices)) == r:             yield tuple(pool[i] for i in indices) </code></pre>  <p>So is its possible for me to just take out both functions and apply them to my code without having the need to import them from itertools?</p>  <ol> <li>Are the modules actually libraries?</li> <li>Can i do a product fuction (Used in the permutations fuction) without a math module?</li> <li>How can i actually implement those lines in my main code (without using the itertools module, an example might be useful ) ?</li> </ol>
