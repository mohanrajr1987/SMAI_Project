<p>I've fully graduated from writing scripts to writing modules. Now that I have a module full of functions, I'm not quite sure if I should order them in some way.</p>  <p>Alphabetical seems to make sense to me, but I wanted to see if there were others schools of thought on how they should be ordered in a module. Maybe try to approximate the flow of the code or some other method? </p>  <p>I did some searching on this and didn't really find anything, except for that functions need to be defined before calling them, which isn't really relevant to my question.</p>  <p>Thanks for any thoughts people can provide!</p>
