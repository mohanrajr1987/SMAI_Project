<p>I am in the situation that I need to load the predefined email templates in WYSIWYG so that an admin can customize that mail and can forward it to a specific user. So I had developed the whole module but the problem arise that I am unable to load template file in WYSIWYG. How it can be done? Should I prefer loading phtml over form.php in admin grid or what can be done? I am not asking the whole code but anyone can guide me for this??</p>
