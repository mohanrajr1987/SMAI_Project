<p>I have a Log function I use in various apps. Its convenient for this to also make Crashlytics logging calls since I use it throughout the app.</p>  <p>However, not every app uses Crashlytics. In Objective C you could handle this with preprocessor conditions.</p>  <p>How would one handle this in code? I think there are ways to make the function conditional perhaps. But how would I optionally or weak import Crashlytics?</p>  <pre><code>import Foundation //import Crashlytics  /// Debug Log: Log useful information while automatically hiding after release. func DLog&lt;T&gt;(message: T, filename: String = __FILE__, function: String = __FUNCTION__, line: Int = __LINE__) { //    CLSLogv("\(NSString(string: filename).lastPathComponent).\(function) line \(line) $ \(message)", getVaList([]))     print("[\(NSString(string: filename).lastPathComponent) \(function) L\(line)] \(message)") } </code></pre>
