<p>I was reading an MDN <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/Synchronous_and_Asynchronous_Requests" rel="nofollow">article</a>, and it states that almost always async is a better approach than making synchronous calls from the browser to your back end. It then goes on to say "In rare cases, the use of a synchronous method is preferable to an asynchronous one." I was wondering what are some use-cases when we would prefer making synchronous requests ?</p>
