<p>I have some object, that can perform operations that take a lot of time. I need some way to interrupt it after a some timeout. My code looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>def f(obj):     time.sleep(600)     obj.cancel() t = threading.Thread(target=f, args=(obj,)) t.start() result = obj.ExecuteLongCommand(arguments) t.stop() # Oops! </code></pre>  <p>So, is there an <em>[easy]</em> way to perform <code>async</code> <code>cancelable</code> operation? My thread <code>t</code> is <code>async</code>, but is not <code>cancelable</code>.</p>
