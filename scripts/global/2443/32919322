<p>I have a main activity in which i have used a view pager.So i can move between 4 tabs and the view pager handles all of that.One of my tabs scans the contacts on the phone to get their details and display it in the recylerview which is in the same tab,this task takes a long time and i am doing this in an async task.Everything is working fine but the problem is if i move to another tab while this scanning is going on the data does not get applied to the recycler view possible because that fragment is being destroyed. Is there a workaround for this or should i just prevent the user from shifting tabs while the scanning is going on (if so some sort of code or a link to the code would be really helpfull).</p>
