<p>Here is what I think my website should be able to provide to user.</p>  <ol> <li>Ability to upload file to the system. It should not blocking, user should be able to surf other pages of the website while upload is ongoing. Once upload is done user will get notified about upload.</li> <li>User should be able to view of his/her uploaded files in website. </li> <li>Ability to edit files in web browsers using third party APIs</li> <li>Number of user are going to be around 5000, and all of them might upload files at the same time so performance should not decrease.</li> <li>Where should I store this files? How to make sure that read and write of files on this directory should handle concurrent user request?</li> </ol>  <p>Considering above points. What should be the best way to architect this website?</p>  <p>Are there any existing web framework that play along with this type of architecture like rails, express? </p>
