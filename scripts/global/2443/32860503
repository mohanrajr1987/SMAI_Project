<p>My synchronous code is near thousand of lines. I want to divide them to some groups and put it in <a href="https://github.com/caolan/async" rel="nofollow">async.auto</a> (one group is one function in async.auto). Each function has the name. I do that because I want to make it easy for other people to do maintain in the future. Code is divide to group so they will easy to understand. I want to know does async.auto cause performance loss comparing with when I don't use it   </p>  <pre><code>do some stuff; do some stuff; do some stuff; ... do some stuff; </code></pre>  <p>I want to change to below:</p>  <pre><code>async.auto({    do_A: function(cb){       do some stuff;       do some stuff;    },    do_B: ['do_A', function(cb, result){       do some stuff with result;       do some stuff with result;    }] }, function(err, result){  }) </code></pre>
