<p>A friend of mine is trying to create a backend system with lots of http comet connections. In fact server needs to send event notifications to many concurrent clients (At least 200). I know opening so much thread concurrently is not feasible and maybe possible. So the solution is async programming, which can be implicit (uwsgi in python...) or explicit (asyncio, tornado...) I guess they will face problems using php since it uses thread for each connection by default. Do I think right?</p>
