<p>The idea is to implement a QBWC web service using Node.js which can serve multiple incoming requests in an asynchronous fashion. Currently I am looking into <a href="https://github.com/johnballantyne/qbws/" rel="nofollow">qbws</a> which is a Node.js web service for QuickBooks Desktop Web Connector. Any ideas on how I can extend this to support an asynchronous architecture for the service methods?<br> Thanks in Advance!</p>
