<p>When @Async is applied to a method making an external call, that Tomcat request thread is now able to handle the next incoming request. But what happens when the external service returns? </p>  <p>If the same thread pool is used, theoretically when the external service returns, all the threads <strong>could</strong> be busy and now we have to wait for a free thread - which means using @Async can actually be slower in this case. </p>  <p>I'm asking just to see the benefits of @Async and to confirm my understanding.</p>
