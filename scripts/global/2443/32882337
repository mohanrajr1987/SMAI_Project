<p>I have a stream of tasks, which my service have to send to the processing service with post request. The problem is that stream is very heavy. How can I send them to the processing service in async mode without receiving the response (my service is broker and it doesn't need the response of such request)?</p>  <p>P.S. I've read about <em>grequests</em> library, but it allows me to accumulate tasks and send them in batch mode using <em>grequests.map</em> (and I also have to wait for responses of each query in this batch). But I should send tasks immediately without accumulating.</p>
