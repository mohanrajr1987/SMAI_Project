<p><b>I Tried as shown below:</b></p>  <pre><code>CREATE TABLE #TEMP ( ID INT, AMOUNT INT )  INSERT INTO #TEMP VALUES(1,10) INSERT INTO #TEMP VALUES(2,5)  SELECT * FROM #TEMP  ID  AMOUNT 1   10 2   5  UPDATE #TEMP SET AMOUNT = SUM(AMOUNT) - 11 </code></pre>  <p><b>Expected Output:</b>     I need to subtract amount from amount filed. Amount "10" should be deducted from ID = 1 and amount "1" should be deducted from ID = 2 and final output should be like.</p>  <pre><code>ID  AMOUNT 1   0 2   4 </code></pre>
