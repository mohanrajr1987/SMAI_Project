<p>I have a problem with the MySQL query generated by PHP:</p>  <pre><code>UPDATE `rozliczenia11` AS `r11`, `rozliczenia12` AS `r12` SET `r11`.stawka = CASE WHEN user = 'bartosz' THEN 6 ELSE stawka END, SET `r12`.stawka = CASE WHEN user = 'bartosz' THEN 6 ELSE stawka END; </code></pre>  <p>The interpreter says I have a syntax error near</p>  <pre><code>SET `r12`.stawka = CASE WHEN user = 'bartosz' THEN 6 ELSE stawka END </code></pre>  <p>When I put only one table to update, it seems fine:</p>  <pre><code>UPDATE `rozliczenia12` AS `r12` SET `r12`.stawka = CASE WHEN user = 'bartosz' THEN 6 ELSE stawka END; </code></pre>  <p>I don't really know what causes the problem, could you please help me?</p>  <p><strong>SOLUTION</strong></p>  <p>I removed the second SET</p>
