<p>My DB has existing data.  I'm trying to implement some sort of security rights system.  It doesn't need to be truly secure...just limit what each level can effectively change.  Technically...one exists...but it needs to be beefed up.</p>  <p>I need to adjust the existing Rights level for people that are Instructors.  I have a query (qInstructors) that lists a DISTINCT query of anyone in the class table listed as an Instructor.  There are a total of 38 Instructors.</p>  <p>Now I need to update the User table to adjust the rights of those 38 people...and this is where I'm stuck.  A simple update query, no problem.  But I must not be searching with the correct term because I can't find anything to help me hammer out the SQL.</p>  <pre><code>UPDATE tblUserList  INNER JOIN tblUserList ON tblUserList.NTID = qInstructors.Instructor  SET tblUserList.Rights = 2 WHERE [NTID]=[Instructor]; </code></pre>  <p>When I try to run this, I get a syntax error in the JOIN.  This is beyond my SQL knowledge...any leads?</p>
