<p>I created a temp table like this:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT      email_key,      Best_pn_ee_active_pbm,      Best_pn_ee_active_pbm_pub,      Best_pn_ee_active_pbm_status,      Best_pn_ee_inactive_pbm,      Best_pn_ee_inactive_pbm_pub,      Best_pn_ee_inactive_pbm_status INTO #kjs_univ_sample FROM view_univ_email </code></pre>  <p>I subsequently added some columns to be populated later:</p>  <pre><code>ALTER TABLE #kjs_univ_sample ADD Best_pn_ee_active_pbm_my varchar(10),      Best_pn_ee_active_pbm_status_my varchar(10),      Best_pn_ee_active_pbm_pub_my varchar(10),      Best_pn_ee_inactive_pbm_my varchar(10),      Best_pn_ee_inactive_pbm_status_my varchar(10),      Best_pn_ee_inactive_pbm_pub_my varchar(10) </code></pre>  <p>I then tried to update the fields I just added:</p>  <pre><code>UPDATE #kjs_univ_sample SET      a.Best_pn_ee_active_pbm_my =        b.s_pbm_account_key,      a.best_pn_ee_active_pbm_pub_my =    b.s_pub_code,     a.best_pn_ee_active_pbm_status_my = b.s_subscription_status FROM #kjs_univ_sample as a RIGHT JOIN #kjsemailcount as b ON a.email_key = b.email WHERE a.email_key = b.email   AND b.counted = '1' </code></pre>  <p>The issue is that all of 4 columns that were added via the <code>ALTER</code> are showing the error</p>  <blockquote>   <p>'The multi-part identifier "" could not be bound.  </p> </blockquote>  <p>I've tried using the alias 'a' in the <code>Update</code> line and not using alias at all.  When I type the name of the fields I want to update it shows the drop-down but none of the fields added by the <code>ALTER</code> are there.  </p>  <p>It's like it doesn't see them. A <code>Select *</code> will show them however. Any ideas? </p>
