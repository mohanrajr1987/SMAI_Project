<p>In my schema, I have a table with</p>  <pre><code>id | word | count | remote_id ----------------------------- </code></pre>  <p>What I'd basically like to do so is that as I'm inserting rows into this table like: </p>  <pre><code>insert into table (word, count, remote_id) VALUES ('cat', 10, 2); </code></pre>  <p>Firstly, if 'cat' already exists with remote_id=2, I'd like the final value of count for 'cat' to be 10 + it's existing value.</p>  <p>If it's not present, it'll be inserted as usual.</p>  <p>How can I achieve this?</p>  <p>Also, right now I have an assertion that the column word must be unique, but I'd only like it unique per remote_id.</p>
