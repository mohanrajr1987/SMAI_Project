<p>I have a very large table people with 60M rows indexed on id, wish to populate a field newid for every record based on a look up table id_conversion (1M rows) which contains id and newid, indexed on id. when I run</p>  <pre><code>update people p set p.newid=(select l.newid from id_conversion l where l.id=p.id) </code></pre>  <p>it runs for an hour or so and then I get an archive error ora 00257. Any suggestions for either running update in sections or better sql command?</p>
