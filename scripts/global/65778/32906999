<p>I have 2 databases one is an old and the other is a new one which was updated and used lately, but one of my team members by mistake update some stuff in the old database and now we are trying to find a way, how to extract the that from an old db and update the records in a new one.</p>  <p>My 2 db are the same in structure except when I pulled the title from both tables on the IDs that were changed, I got few titles different but the rest where same. </p>  <p>So can someone help with this? What I have is a list of ID from an old table that were changed about 2000 records, and what I need is an mysql script that would loop trough all of those records and update the new database content with that one.   </p>  <p>Table structure in both tables is:</p>  <pre><code>ID, title, content  </code></pre>  <p>So I was trying something like this:</p>  <pre><code>UPDATE `dbA`.table SET `dbA`.content = `dbB`.contet WHERE `dbB`.`ID` BETWEEN 0 AND 2000 </code></pre>
