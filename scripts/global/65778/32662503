<p>Yo guys. I have got 3 rows in my table news (image_1, image_2, image_3). Can I swap them like that? Because this part of code doesn't work.</p>  <pre><code>mysql_query("update news               set image_1=image_2,                   image_2=image_3,                   image_3=''               where image_1=$_GET[deletephoto]"); </code></pre>
