<p>I have a stored procedure and I want to update a value in a table with the SYSDATE only if a parameter is NOT NULL.</p>  <p>In the following SQL, I want to set SYSENDDATE to NULL if pETime IS NULL Otherwise to SYSDATE</p>  <pre><code>UPDATE OLCACT SET      ENDDATE    = pETime,      SYSENDDATE = SYSDATE,      GRD        = pGRD,     PASS       = v_pass </code></pre>  <p>Not sure how to use either NVL or COALESCE to do that.</p>
