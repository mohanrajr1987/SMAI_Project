<p>I have made a table 'wp_mostfavourite' in wordpress database, it has got three fields, 'serialno', 'postid', 'counts'.</p>  <p>The 'counts' is supposed to increased by 1, whenever the following query is executed.</p>  <pre><code>$postids = $_GET['action']; // I tried stripslashes($_GET['action']) as well, the query is not working  $querycount="update wp_mostfavourite set counts = counts+1 where postid = $postids";  $wpdb-&gt;query($querycount); </code></pre>  <p>But after running, this query changes the value of counts for the particular postid in the table to 1, no matter if I write counts = counts+1 or counts = counts+ 5</p>  <p>If I put the value of postid in the where clause directly it works.</p>  <pre><code>$querycount="update wp_mostfavourite set counts = counts+1 where postid = 72270"; </code></pre>  <p>Or if I change $postids to any real value instead of GET request it works.</p>  <pre><code>$postids=72270;  </code></pre>  <p>I even tried $wpdb->prepare, but still facing the same issue</p>  <pre><code>$wpdb-&gt;query( $wpdb-&gt;prepare(  "     update wp_mostfavourite     set counts = counts+%d         where postid= %d  ",  1,  $postids // the query is working when I replace it with values such as 72270  ) ); </code></pre>  <p>Any possible suggestions will be appreciated.</p>
