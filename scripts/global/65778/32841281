<p>I am relatively new to this so I was hoping that somebody could help me. I am not sure if this is the correct place to put this but I will go ahead anyway.</p>  <p>I am looking for a query that updates another table depending on what option is selected (Reservation,Appointment, MMC, SYC Appointment, SYC Valuation Form and Not Available). Each of these are worth a different Value (See below)...</p>  <pre><code>Reservation 2 Appointment 2 MMC 1 SYC Appointment 1 SYC Valuation Form 1 Not Available 0 </code></pre>  <p>I have used this query:</p>  <pre><code>    UPDATE vehicle_collection.ind_summary JOIN vehicle_collection.form ON  vehicle_collection.ind_summary.TM_ID = vehicle_collection.form.TM_ID JOIN  vehicle_collection.result ON vehicle_collection.form.Enquiry_Result_ID =                vehicle_collection.result.Enquiry_Result_ID  SET ind_summary.Total_Points =ind_summary.Total_Points +  vehicle_collection.result.EnquiryValues,ind_summary.Target_Countdown =  ind_summary.Target_Countdown - vehicle_collection.result.EnquiryValues WHERE  vehicle_collection.ind_summary.TM_ID = " 115 " ;  </code></pre>  <hr>  <pre><code>Table 1: Enquiry_ID|TM_ID| username|Enquiry_Result_ID 1            115   Bob         Appointment  Table 2 (Updating)  TM_ID| Total_Points|Target_Countdown|  115      0            100  Once the form is submitted I want it to look like this:-  TM_ID| Total_Points|Target_Countdown|  115      2            98 </code></pre>  <p>The issue with this query is for each option, the second table doesn't update untill it has been entered twice?? </p>
