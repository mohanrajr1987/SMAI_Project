<p>I have this code which works perfectly but only problem I have is that when I enter an username or a password which does not exists in the database this code still displays the message " password changed successfully" ,without any change in db or error message. I want to know a way to handle this. Is there a way to display a message when <code>WHERE</code> condition fails??</p>  <pre><code>Try         If txtBoxSettingNewPassword.Text = txtBoxSettingConfPassword.Text Then             con.Open()             cmd.Connection = con             cmd.CommandType = System.Data.CommandType.Text             cmd.CommandText = ("UPDATE [User] " &amp; _             "SET password = '" &amp; (txtBoxSettingNewPassword.Text) &amp; "'" &amp; _             "WHERE user_name ='" &amp; (txtBoxSettingUserName.Text) &amp; "'" &amp; " and password = '" &amp; (txtBoxSettingOldPassword.Text) &amp; "';")             cmd.ExecuteNonQuery()             MessageBox.Show("password changed successfully")         Else             MessageBox.Show("Passwords do not match")         End If     Catch ex As Exception         MessageBox.Show("Something went wrong," &amp; ex.Message)     Finally         con.Close()     End Try  </code></pre>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
