<p>I have a MySQL table with multiple columns, A, B, and C. </p>  <p>I would like to update those columns using only one SQL statement. However, sometimes some of the columns can be null. </p>  <p>So, if A is null, only update B and C.</p>  <p>If A and B are null, only update C.</p>  <p>And so on, with all other combinations.</p>  <p>How can I do that in one single statement?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
