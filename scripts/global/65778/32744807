<p>I'm writing an update query to update the Table Request, field S06 field with the information from Table relay, field S10. This works perfectly when I add another "and" such as "AND TREQUEST.ID = '18641'</p>  <p>But when I remove the specific record, I get the "Subquery returned more than 1 value. This is not permitted when the subquery follow =, !=, &lt;, &lt;=, >, >= or when the subquery is used as an expression.</p>  <p>Can anyone help me with this code so it can work with multiple records. I thought about writing a counter and go through each iteration one at a time, but that has to be a better way to do that. </p>  <p>Thanks in advance for any help you can provide.</p>  <pre><code>UPDATE TREQUEST SET TREQUEST.S06 = TRELAY.S10 FROM TREQUEST JOIN TRELAY ON TREQUEST.RELAYID = TRELAY.ID WHERE TREQUEST.S03 LIKE '%ACTIVE%' AND TRELAY.ID = TREQUEST.RELAYID </code></pre>
