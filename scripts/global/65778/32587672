<p>This update query is not working it just hangs</p>  <pre><code>UPDATE tempimportmailer ti SET lead_id = leads.id FROM leads  INNER JOIN tempimportmailer ON leads.full_name = tempimportmailer.name AND leads.address = tempimportmailer.add1 AND leads.zip_code = tempimportmailer.zip WHERE tempimportmailer.lead_id = 0 </code></pre>  <p>I have also tried the following, but the results were not what I had anticipated, the lead_numbers did not match up correctly when I viewed the tempimportmailer table. </p>  <pre><code>UPDATE tempimportmailer SET lead_id = leads.id FROM leads  WHERE leads.full_name = tempimportmailer.name AND leads.address = tempimportmailer.add1 AND leads.zip_code = tempimportmailer.zip  AND tempimportmailer.lead_id = 0; </code></pre>  <p>I am new to PostgreSQL so please go easy on me.</p>
