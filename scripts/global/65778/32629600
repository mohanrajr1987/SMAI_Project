<p>When I run this page, its says <code>You couldnt execute query</code>. I think there is a syntax problem, but I cannot see the problem.</p>  <p>The variables look fine when I echo them. I added the column names as a code comment. All the columns are <code>VARCHAR</code>.</p>  <p>I don't believe it is a connection problem since I can perform <code>SELECT AND DELETE</code> operations from other <code>php</code> pages.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php   $id = $_POST["id"]; $name = $_POST["name"]; $surname = $_POST["surname"]; $phone = $_POST["phone"];  /* Table in the DDBB(all are VARCHAR): CUST_ID  CUST_FORENAME   CUST_PHONE  CUST_SURNAME*/  $query = "UPDATE customers SET CUST_ID='$id',$CUST_FORENAME='$name',             CUST_PHONE='$phone', CUST_SURNAME='$surname' WHERE CUST_ID=$id";  $result = mysqli_query ($connection,$query)     or die ("You couldnâ€™t execute query");  echo "&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;User $id has been updated.";  ?&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; </code></pre>
