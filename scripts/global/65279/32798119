<p>I'm developing an app, that fill in a gridView with an image and text from JSON files, i take just 2 o 3 seconds to finish the AsyncTask that perform this. I wonder if there is a way to display a splash screen (with some brand on it) and at the same time launch de asynctask that search on the JSON files, so that when the asynctask is finished the splash screen goes away and i have my activity with the grid view with all the necesary elements on it? Thanks! </p>
