<p>I am having navigation drawer in which there are 8 menus in the drawer and each menu is having fragment which is downloading different data so each fragment is having its own AsyncTask. Now the problem is when users selects another menu from navigation drawer while first one is fetching data and populating Adapters of first data, app gives "unfortunately application stopped"... I want to add one more point so that you will get this more clearly. That is when I am opening the app first fragment starts fetching data and populating Adapter. If I do exit from the app while download of data (of first fragment) app do crashes because data is being downloaded and trying to update fragment adapter(of the data) but the fragment has been detached(). So basically I want to stop data download of the first fragment when user selects second one. </p>
