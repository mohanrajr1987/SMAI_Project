<p>I got and SSLHandshakeException when I use synchronized connection to an HTTPS server. If I use asynchronized connection to same url I can't get two differentes answer: </p>  <p>Case 1: If I call the asynchronized request directly from main thread I got an 403 forbidden and empty response body. </p>  <p>Case 2: If I call the asynchronized request from a AsyncTask that had been called from main I got an 200 and the right response body that I am expecting. </p>  <p>So my question, why will the synchronized requested fail, and why I have to call the asynchronized request through an AsyncTask to get the expected answer? </p>  <p><strong>UPDATE</strong> Looks like the problem with calling synchronous request inside the AsyncTask is that the Authenticator to OKHttp client is not done setting the Authenticator, therefor I am getting the Handshake Exception. </p>
