<p><strong>Goal</strong>: update a widget view after <code>AsyncTask</code> completes.</p>  <p><strong>Scenario</strong>: widget <code>onReceive</code> receives an intent from a user click.  This starts a networking operation in an <code>AsyncTask</code>.  An <code>interface</code> has been passed to the <code>AsyncTask</code> via constructor as described <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/9963705/1744123">here</a>.  In the <code>interface</code> method, I'm trying to send a broadcast that will trigger the widget's <code>onUpdate</code> method but I don't believe that it is firing.  </p>  <p><strong>Thoughts</strong>: My best guess is that <code>onReceive</code> has returned, therefore the <code>Context</code> that I was trying to use to <code>sendBroadcast</code> is no longer available.  I was thinking that I could <code>get()</code>  the <code>AsyncTask</code> but I don't want to trigger ANR if the operation takes too long.  If I <code>get(timeout, unit)</code> the <code>AsyncTask</code>, I'm afraid that I risk missing the end of the task and the view will not be updated.</p>  <p>What's the best way to update the widget view upon completion of the task?</p>  <p><strong>Solution</strong>: Turns out that I made a mistake crafting the <code>Intent</code> that I was broadcasting</p>
