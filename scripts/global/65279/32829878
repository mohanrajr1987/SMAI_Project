<p>In my application I have a requirement to display Images that are stored in external storage directory. I populate list view with these images. But, if there are too many images say, >10, app runs out of memory. I now understand that I should implement an Async task to achieve this.Can some one help me how do I do this. Should I call the Async class in LisviewAdapter.java or Activity.java? Any example would be greatly helpful.Thanks in advance.</p>
