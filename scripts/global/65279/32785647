<p>I have master view with images within every item. I've implemented lazy image fetching as in this example <a href="https://github.com/googlesamples/android-DisplayingBitmaps" rel="nofollow">Displaying Bitmaps Sample</a>. When I click item detail view appears. Data for detail view is also downloading from internet.</p>  <p>The problem is when I go to detail view while images in master view are just start downloading then DetailAsyncTask (which download necessary data in detail view) starts only after ImageFetchingTask of master view is done.</p>  <p>So my question is what is best approach in order for detail view to start its DetailAsyncTask immediately? Cancelling ImageFetchingTask when detail view creates or to set higher priority to its DetailAsyncTask or something else? </p>
