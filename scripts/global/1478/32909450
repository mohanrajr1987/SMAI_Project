<p>I just installed VS 2015 Community and when i want to add a new item to the project some of the templates are shown twice.</p>  <p>for example the "Class" Template is apperaing twice and also is several others.</p>  <p>Also i checked the following paths (where the templates of VS are stored)</p>  <p>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\Common7\IDE\ProjectTemplates</p>  <p>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\Common7\IDE\ItemTemplates</p>  <p>to validate if their are maybe duplicates of the templates, but their is none.</p>  <p>Why is it happening? and how to fix this?</p>
