<p>According to <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/inline" rel="nofollow">cppref</a>, the identity characteristics of <code>inline</code> functions in multiple translation units are as follows:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>...</p>      <p>2) It has the same address in every translation unit.</p>      <p>3) Function-local static objects in all function definitions are   shared across all translation units (they all refer to the same object   defined in one translation unit)</p>      <p>...</p> </blockquote>  <p>Simply speaking, a singleton identity is implied.</p>  <p>I'm wondering whether the same applies to function template instantiations <strong>without</strong> the <code>inline</code> specifier.</p>
