<p>I have the following basic models:</p>  <pre><code>public class Sandbox {     private String firstName;     private Integer age;     private List&lt;Split&gt; split; }  public class Split {     private Integer sandboxId; } </code></pre>  <p>My SandboxMapper is configured as below:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;resultMap id="SandboxMap" type="Sandbox"&gt;     &lt;id property="firstName" column="FIRSTNAME"/&gt;     &lt;result property="age" column="AGE"/&gt;     &lt;collection property="split" javaType="list" ofType="Split" column="AGE" select="selectSplit"&gt;         &lt;id property="sandboxId" column="SANDBOX_ID"/&gt;     &lt;/collection&gt; &lt;/resultMap&gt;  &lt;select id="selectSandbox" resultMap="SandboxMap"&gt;     SELECT * FROM SANDBOX     WHERE AGE=#{age} &lt;/select&gt;  &lt;select id="selectSplit" parameterType="int" resultType="com.scibor.Split"&gt;     SELECT * FROM SPLIT     WHERE Split.SANDBOX_ID=#{age} &lt;/select&gt; </code></pre>  <p>And I have in my Database some entries such that there is a Sandbox with Age 14 and there are a few Splits whose SANDBOX_ID is 14. There are no imposed constraints on any of the columns because it was not specified in the documentation that I had to do so, i.e. these are all simple data types, <code>NUMBER</code> and <code>VARCHAR</code> no notion of <code>PRIMARY KEY</code>, <code>NOT NULL</code> etc.</p>  <p>Within my code I then invoke:</p>  <pre><code>Sandbox sandbox = session.selectOne("Sandbox.selectSandbox", 14); </code></pre>  <p>This returns a <code>Sandbox</code> object whose <code>Name</code> and <code>Age</code> fields are properly set, however, the array associated with <code>splits</code> it's just an array of nulls. If I was to guarantee uniqueness and change <code>collection</code> to <code>association</code>, it would be the same thing, <code>split</code> would just be <code>null</code>. </p>  <p>I've been staring at this for some time and I have tried all sorts of values for <code>column</code> in <code>collection</code> tag, as well as various variants of the <code>selectSplit</code> entry, but none of them work, they always return a null value for <code>split</code>. More annoyingly, no exceptions are thrown so it seems that all of the SQL queries being generated are in fact valid (most likely the last <code>#{age}</code> is itself <code>null</code>).</p>  <p>Can someone please explain how I can retrieve an instance of <code>Sandbox</code> with a <code>List&lt;Split&gt;</code> populated using MyBatis? The documentation is helpful but I have followed the examples, I think exactly, yet I am still not getting the expected result.</p>
