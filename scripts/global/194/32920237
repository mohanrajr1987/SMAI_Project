<p>I am facing this error.</p>  <p>I have two Schema Schema A and Schema B</p>  <p>Schema B contains a table my_table in which values are being Inserted.</p>  <p>There is also a triggger my_trigger written for my_table in schemaB for each row</p>  <pre><code>            CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER schemaB.my_trigger                ON schemaA.my_table                FOR EACH ROW                BEGIN                IF INSERTING THEN                   schemaA.my_package.my_procedure (:NEW.field_A,NEW.field_B, :NEW.field_C);                END IF;             EXCEPTION                WHEN OTHERS THEN                 Insert into my_log(DBMS_UTILITY.format_error_stack,sysdate);             END my_trigger;             /    AFTER INSERT </code></pre>  <p>This trigger written on my_table of schemaB is calling a procedure which is present in Schema A.</p>  <p>However when the trigger is being fired I am getting the below error in my logs</p>  <pre><code>            ERROR: ORA-04061: existing state of package "schemaA.my_package" has been invalidated             ORA-04065: not executed, altered or dropped package "schemaA.my_package"             ORA-06508: PL/SQL: could not find program unit being called: "schemaA.my_package"             ORA-06512: at "schemaB.my_trigger", line 17      10/1/2015 6:38:07 PM </code></pre>  <p>Also the procedure in schemaA is declared as PRAGMA_AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION</p>  <p>Is this some grants issue as i checked all the grants has been given, I have checked dependencies of the both trigger and procedure and all seems to valid. Can you kindly help?</p>  <p>I have tried using Pragma serially_reusable in the calling package but still giving me same error</p>  <p>Many thanks</p>
