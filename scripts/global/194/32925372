<p>I'm currently developing a simple application which does crud operations on a few tables.</p>  <p>It looks like this:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/mkeeR.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/mkeeR.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I have a problem with the add item form, invoked by pressing the button saying "Nova jedinica mjere". It opens a popup containing an ADF form as follows:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Qisyo.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Qisyo.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>As you can see it does a create insert operation on popup fetch event, creating an empty row. When I fill the form with data, and press OK(the ok button is handled in the bean, doing a commit operation), I get an empty error message as follows:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/nWhxQ.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/nWhxQ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>This only happens if the table is editable(consisting of input text elements). If it is set to click to edit, this problem does not occur. How can I make validation only occur on form fields?</p>  <p>If you need any more info, please let me know because I too am new to adf.</p>
