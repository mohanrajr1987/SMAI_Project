<p>I have a school 'project' to work on, which has some tables and one table needs to have a constraint which is not working out for me.</p>  <p>There are some tables like QUESTION, ANSWER and REACTION. A reaction belongs with or a question or a answer but not both on the same time. There by I have 2 rows:</p>  <pre><code>  question_id         NUMBER,   answer_id           NUMBER, </code></pre>  <p>Both not null because the cant by null, but not on the same time.</p>  <p>I already made a constraint but isn't working..</p>  <pre><code>  /* CHECK if reaction belongs to an question or a answer             NOT WORKING YET*/ CONSTRAINT CHECK_question_or_answer CHECK((answer_id != NULL AND question_id = NULL) OR (answer_id = NULL OR question_id != NULL)) </code></pre>  <p>Already tested the constraint and I can insert a value without a question_id or answer_id. I hope it's a bit clear, if not, I am happy yo try explain myself better. (still newby on SQL)</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
