<p>Is there a way to give names to already existing constraints?  <br>for example :</p>  <pre><code>create table employee (emp_id number(10),emp_name varchar2(20), dept_id number(10),foreign key(dept_id) references department(dept_id)); </code></pre>  <p>In the above query I haven't named the foreign key constraint so after the creation of the table can I give a name to it also can the foreign key constraint be dropped without dropping the column??</p>
