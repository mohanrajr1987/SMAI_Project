<p>I am new to databases and PHP. In my code I am trying to create a table from within PHP script, Here is what I have. </p>  <pre><code>create table booktable(BookID INT PRIMARY KEY,                    BookName VARCHAR(100),                    Published DATE,                    Price NUMBER(18,2),                    Author1 VARCHAR2(30),                    Author2 VARCHAR2(30));  INSERT INTO booktable (BookID, BookName, Published, Price, Author1, Author2) VALUES (1, 'Fundamentals of Digital Logic with VHDL Design','14-APR-08', 190.25,'Stephen Brown','Zvon Ko G.Vranesic'); INSERT INTO booktable (BookID, BookName, Published, Price, Author1, Author2) VALUES (2, 'Distributed Systems Principles and Paradigm','26-JUL-13', 197.80,'Andrew S. Tanenbaum','Maarten Van Steen'); INSERT INTO booktable (BookID, BookName, Published, Price, Author1, Author2) VALUES (3, 'Eat Real Food The Only Solution to Permanent weight Loss and Disease Prevention','1-APR-15', 29.99,'David Gillespie',''); INSERT INTO booktable (BookID, BookName, Published, Price, Author1, Author2) VALUES (4, 'Introduction to Computational Science Modeling and Simulation for the sciences','2-MAY-06', 132.75,'Angela B.Shiflet','George W. Shiflet'); INSERT INTO booktable (BookID, BookName, Published, Price, Author1, Author2) VALUES (5, 'Live Well on Less A Practical Guide to Running a Lean Household','27-MAY-15', 19.00,'Jody Allen',''); INSERT INTO booktable (BookID, BookName, Published, Price, Author1, Author2) VALUES (6, 'Middle School: Just My Rotten Luck','1-JUL-15', 15.99,'James Patterson',''); INSERT INTO booktable (BookID, BookName, Published, Price, Author1, Author2) VALUES (7, 'Clementine Rose and the Birthday Emergency','1-JUL-15', 12.99,'Jacqueline Harvey',''); INSERT INTO booktable (BookID, BookName, Published, Price, Author1, Author2) VALUES (8, 'My Life It''s a long story','26-MAY-15', 32.99,'Willie Nelson',''); INSERT INTO booktable (BookID, BookName, Published, Price, Author1, Author2) VALUES (9, 'Sword of Summer Magnus Chase','7-OCT-15', 15.99,'Rick Riordan',''); </code></pre>  <p>The table is created successfully, but when I try to run the query </p>  <pre><code>`SQL&gt; select *        from booktable       where bookname like '%my%';` </code></pre>  <p>It says no rows selected. I can't figure out where I am doing wrong. Thanks.</p>
