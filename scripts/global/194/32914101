<p>In the school assignment I'm working on I need to display the 3 criminals with the most crimes. But I'm having a few problems</p>  <p>Here's the code I have so far, and its output:</p>  <pre><code>`Select Last, First, Count(Crime_ID)  From Criminals Natural Join crimes  Group by Last, First, Criminal_ID  order by Count(Crime_Id) Desc`  `LAST            FIRST      COUNT(CRIME_ID)  --------------- ---------- ---------------  Panner          Lee                      2   Sums            Tammy                    1   Statin          Penny                    1   Dabber          Pat                      1   Mansville       Nancy                    1   Cat             Tommy                    1   Phelps          Sam                      1   Caulk           Dave                     1   Simon           Tim                      1   Pints           Reed                     1   Perry           Cart                     1    11 rows selected ` </code></pre>  <p>I've been toying around with ROWNUM, but when I include it in the SELECT it won't run because of my GROUP BY. But If you put ROWNUM in the GROUP BY it just separates everything back out.</p>  <p>I just want to display the top 3 with the most crimes, which is weird because only 1 guy has more than 1 crime. Theoretically, more criminals would be added to the Database, but these are the tables given in the assignment.</p>
