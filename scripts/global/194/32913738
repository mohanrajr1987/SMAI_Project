<p>I want to create a SQL function that returns the count of the table or details from the table base on argument.Eg:Select getvalues('count') from dual; which should return only 1 column count of employee table.Select getvalues('detail') from dual;which should return 10 selective columns of employee table.I do not find a way to achieve this. I dynamically created query inside function and written it to sysref-cursor and returned it. But it if not on readable format.</p>  <p>Eg output: "","","","",</p>  <p>Please advise.</p>
