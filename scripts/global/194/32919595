<p>I installed Oracle on a Win32 Vista Pc.  I configured VM to use linux, ubuntu 32.</p>  <p>For storage, buildozer.vdi was selected.</p>  <p>This is the setup recommend for those who wish to simply building an android apk using kivy.</p>  <p>When starting the VM, I'll eventually come to a black screen like a command prompt and I'll click the screen to trigger keyboard and mouse capture.</p>  <p>The problem is...</p>  <p>No keyboard input and no visible mouse cursor.  Even the prompt on the screen doesn't flash.</p>  <p>I have to hit ctrl, alt, delete in order to get os control back.</p>  <p>What the hell is going on?</p>
