<p>I need to retrieve the records from some tables with following condition <code>BETWEEN SYSDATE-1095 AND SYSDATE</code> in an <code>SSIS</code> package which connects to an Oracle database. however, the data flow task is hanging with this statement. when I tried replacing this line with <code>BETWEEN SYSDATE-50 AND SYSDATE</code>, it worked fine. </p>  <p>I want to break the data flow task into several tasks and replace the above line of code in each of the tasks such that I cover the 3 years records. Can you please assist. Will these following lines be correct if I replace them in each of the data flow tasks?</p>  <pre><code>AND LAB.DETAIL_SVC_DATE BETWEEN SYSDATE-100 AND SYSDATE -- data flow task1 AND LAB.DETAIL_SVC_DATE BETWEEN SYSDATE-200 AND SYSDATE+100 --data flow task2 AND LAB.DETAIL_SVC_DATE BETWEEN SYSDATE-300 AND SYSDATE+200 --etc AND LAB.DETAIL_SVC_DATE BETWEEN SYSDATE-400 AND SYSDATE+300 AND LAB.DETAIL_SVC_DATE BETWEEN SYSDATE-500 AND SYSDATE+400 AND LAB.DETAIL_SVC_DATE BETWEEN SYSDATE-600 AND SYSDATE+500 AND LAB.DETAIL_SVC_DATE BETWEEN SYSDATE-700 AND SYSDATE+600 AND LAB.DETAIL_SVC_DATE BETWEEN SYSDATE-800 AND SYSDATE+700 AND LAB.DETAIL_SVC_DATE BETWEEN SYSDATE-900 AND SYSDATE+800 AND LAB.DETAIL_SVC_DATE BETWEEN SYSDATE-1000 AND SYSDATE+900 AND LAB.DETAIL_SVC_DATE BETWEEN SYSDATE-1095 AND SYSDATE+1000 AND LAB.DETAIL_SVC_DATE BETWEEN SYSDATE-1096 AND SYSDATE+1095 </code></pre>
