<p>I have a field which is getting data that contains a special character type of apostrophe outside of the normal oracle ascii range of 0-127. I am trying to do a replace function on this but it keeps being switched to a ? in the DDL. Looking for another way to do the replace</p>  <p>This works in a query but switches when put in the DDL for a view</p>  <pre><code>regexp_replace(field_name,'â€™',chr(39)) </code></pre>  <p>switches to</p>  <pre><code>regexp_replace(field_name,'?',chr(39)) </code></pre>  <p>A dump function shows that oracle is storing the apostrophe as three characters of ascii 226,128,153. I tried to write the replace on a concatenation of those but that didn't work either.</p>
