<p>The database is Oracle XE .</p>  <p>Let me explain the scenario first ,</p>  <p>Two tables <code>Movie</code> and <code>UserInfo</code> are in a relationship many to many using the junction table <code>Rating</code>. </p>  <p><code>Rating</code> ( <code>MovieID</code> (FK) , <code>UserName</code>(FK) , <code>Rating</code>)</p>  <p><code>MovieID</code> and <code>UserName</code> are both respectively the primary keys in the respected tables. </p>  <p>What I am trying to do is make a <code>select</code> statement to select the MovieNames from the Movie table where UserName is not equal to the given input. As the MoveID was the FK, but I need to retrieve MovieName if the movie is not already been rated by the GIVEN user, so I guess I may need to make a rather complex joining operation - which I can't figure out or maybe joining two or more different query using where.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance and please if possible give an explanation about the solution.</p>
