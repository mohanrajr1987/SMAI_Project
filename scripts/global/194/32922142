<p>I was trying to load records from a file to an oracle table based on conditions. Since OR operator and WHEN IN statements do not work in sql loader, I tried multiple insert to a table. However, only the records that match the first condition were loaded in the table and the records that matched the second condition were not loaded. My control file looks like below:</p>  <pre><code>Options (BINDSIZE = 7340032) Load Data APPEND INTO TABLE TEMP_GLOBAL_ONE_FEE_REBATE WHEN ACT_TYPE = 'SR' FIELDS TERMINATED BY '|' TRAILING NULLCOLS (         RPT_YEAR,         RPT_MONTH,         ........         ........  )   INTO TABLE TEMP_GLOBAL_ONE_FEE_REBATE WHEN ACT_TYPE = 'SL' FIELDS TERMINATED BY '|' TRAILING NULLCOLS (         RPT_YEAR,         RPT_MONTH,         ........         ........  ) </code></pre>  <p>** As mentioned, only those records with act_type = 'SR' were loaded and those records with act_type = 'SL' were not loaded.</p>  <p>Any idea how to go on this? Thank you.</p>
