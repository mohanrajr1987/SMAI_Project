<p>I have a stored proc in a package that is erroring out with 'ORA-00942: table or view does not exist error.'  I have narrowed it to the following line in the WHERE clause which is causing the error: WHERE HO.num IN (SELECT * FROM TABLE(TO_TABLE(in_home_off_number))  </p>  <p>The function TO_TABLE and the stored proc calling the function are in the same package. And if I hard-code a value (like '123' or ' ') for the parameter in_home_off_number it returns the results without any error. Also in_home_off_number is an optional parameter in the proc. Verified the TO_TABLE function and this is not causing the issue as the same function is being used in another procedure which is working fine.So for some reason the in_home_off_number is getting lost when it is passed into the query. Nothing has changed in the package recently and suddenly I see this error when executed and confused about what is causing this issue.</p>
