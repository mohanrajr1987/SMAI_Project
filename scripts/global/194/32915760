<p>I have the following query as Oracle</p>  <pre><code>   SELECT DISTINCT count(pa.payment_id)   FROM     location c,    inventory e,     inventory_stock es,    payment_client ep,     payment pa,    currency cur,     location s,    exchange_country exc,     exchange_rate sso,     exchange_hike so,     exchange_margin sov  WHERE     cur.outState = 'N' AND     c.location_id = e.location_id AND     e.inventory_id = ep.inventory_id AND     e.inventory_stock_id = es.inventory_stock_id AND     ep.client_id = pa.end_client AND     pa.cur_id = cur.cur_id AND     cur.location_id = s.location_id AND     s.avpn_icore_location_id  is not null  AND     cur.cur_id = exc.cur_id(+) AND     exc.exchange_id = sso.exchange_id(+) AND     sso.account_id = so.account_id(+) AND     so.option_name(+)  = 'PREMIUM' AND     exc.exchange_id = sov.exchange_id(+) AND     sov.name(+)  = 'VALUE'; </code></pre>  <p>Right now I am using H2 database and the syntax error I got was from <code>so.option_name(+)</code> and <code>sov.name(+);</code> I know the (+) are oracle's way of right join and left join but are there any possible way to convert this into h2 so the error and the grammar are equivalent?</p>
