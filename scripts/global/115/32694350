<p>I'm writing some "non standard" XML, where the tags can vary depending some business logic. I'm using castor with XML mappings and it is working good, except for those tags I need to "customise" I'm about to drop all things done with caster just because of this .. and about to create the xml myself with Strings .. Unless someone has an idea on how to do it properly</p>  <p>Exemple </p>  <pre><code>&lt;field name="corps"             type="fr.canalplus.antenne.commun.objetplat.CommandeSAPObjetPlat"&gt;             &lt;bind-xml name= "COMMANDE"/&gt;         &lt;/field&gt; </code></pre>  <p>What I need is that "COMMANDE" would be some value retrieved from my java class corresponding.</p>  <p>I have no idea if this is even possible.. Thanks for your answers</p>
