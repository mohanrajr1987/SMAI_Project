<p>I have been informed to remove obsolete tags from TFS,Is there is a option to remove tags that are no longer needed?In other words "centralized" method to manage them. <em>Pls also note that there are <strong>User stories</strong> &amp; <strong>Bugs</strong> already added to TFS using these obsolete tags.</em></p>
