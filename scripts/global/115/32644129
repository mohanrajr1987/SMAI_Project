<p>I have a table with some submissions, this table has a <code>tags</code> field, and I need to search in it.</p>  <p>The data is saved in JSON format in the table, like this: <code>["basic","example","html","chart"]</code></p>  <p>I'm trying to find a way to search all rows in the tags fields, but not sure how it can be done the best way when it is in this format.</p>  <p>The user submits an tag to search, like: <code>html</code>, then I need to search all rows for that tag, without to much overhead.</p>  <p>I know most people use to say: what have you tried yourself? - well, nothing. As I have no clue how to do this, I know how to search in sql and all that. but never tried it in this logic.</p>
