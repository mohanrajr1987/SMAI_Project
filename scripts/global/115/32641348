<p>i'm volunteering for an organization and am helping them make an Android app where we download html from an atom feed to the app database for presentation inside the app. The html articles are entered in an online CMS system and presented on the website of the organization as well in a regular way</p>  <p>The thing is that when we get the html inside the app we would like to split it up for formatting and extracting different parts. I'm thinking that we are going to need to put custom invisible markers of some sort into the html. So my question: What is the best way to do this?</p>  <p>A few ideas i have come across:</p>  <ul> <li>custom html tags</li> <li><code>&lt;span&gt;</code> with a class/id attribute</li> <li><code>&lt;div&gt;</code> with a class/id attribute</li> <li>putting the class/id attribute into existing tags (like <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> etc)</li> <li>html inline comments</li> </ul>  <p>What do you think of these options? Are there better alternatives? Is there another way to think about this whole problem?</p>  <p>Grateful for help and with kind regards, Tord</p>
