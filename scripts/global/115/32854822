<p>I am tasked by my client to create a semantic search engine for medical articles. The articles come with tags that were created under certain standards (SNOMED, RxNorm). My client said that currently they were not satisfied with the keyword search which only does exact match. What could be an ideal way for doctors to look up medical information? I want some sample queries so I can better understand the picture.</p>
