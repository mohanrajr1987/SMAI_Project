<p>I've red online that Tags are the way to go and scriptlets are out of date and bad style. Having said that, I find creating tags a huge waste of time (since you have to make TLD files and xml files etc.) and find "including" my functions from another class and reusing them like this:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;%= BackendClass.PrintText("Hello!"); %&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Much faster and also easier to read and debug. Does any one else code like this or everyone actually uses Tags?</p>
