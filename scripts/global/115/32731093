<p>In <code>Woocommerce 2.4.7</code>, <strong>for example</strong>, If I click on <code>Starwars</code> tag, I would see the store page with all the Star Wars items and I will see in the sidebar that I have <code>14 Star Wars items in DVD, 50 Star Wars items in Toys, 14 Star Wars items in T-shirts</code>.</p>  <p>But if I click in any of these categories, <strong>for example</strong> <code>DVD</code>, Woocommerce takes me to the category page where I will see all the DVDs from my store and not only the Star Wars DVDs...</p>  <p><strong>In the tag page does anyone know a way to filter by category the results of that tag?</strong></p>  <p>Thank you in advance.</p>
