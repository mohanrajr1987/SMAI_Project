<p>I've written some code which automatically creates some posts and adds a tag to them. I can see the tags in the 'All posts' admin panel and I can click on the posts 'Tag' link to get just those posts with the tags.</p>  <p>Here is my code:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php $tag_ID= single_tag_title();                     $args = array(                         'post_type' =&gt; 'post',                         'tag_id'    =&gt;  $tag_ID,                         'posts_per_page' =&gt; 10,                         'order'          =&gt;'ASC'                     );                     $posts = get_posts( $args );                     var_dump($args );                     foreach ( $posts as $post ) {                         ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Can you help me to get all tag posts? Thank you.</p>
