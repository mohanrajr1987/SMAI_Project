<p>IÂ´m researching about HTML5 and have maybe a stupid doubt:</p>  <p><strong>Can I close the tags? Will this affect the functionality?</strong></p>  <p>Examples:</p>  <p>HTML5</p>  <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; // Is the same &lt;!DOCTYPE html /&gt; ?  &lt;html lang="en"&gt; // Is the same &lt;html lang="en" /&gt; ?  &lt;meta charset =" utf-8"&gt; Is the same &lt;meta charset =" utf-8" /&gt; ? </code></pre>  <p>I ask this because in ALL the books I read show tags without closing slash. I understand the "new manner", the lack of need, etc, etc, etc. <strong>I just want to know if the use of closed tags could be a problem or goes against the standard.</strong></p>
