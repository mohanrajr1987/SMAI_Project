<p>I would like to include flags in the cache lines of both caches in the current version of the Rocket chip. These flags will be loaded/stored along with the data at a memory address. The lowRISC (<a href="http://www.lowrisc.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.lowrisc.org/</a>) developers have done something similar. However, they access load/store flags and data as separate instructions (i.e. instructions store/load flags and existing instructions to store/load data), and their architecture design was forked from an old version of the rocket-chip, and the rocket-chip source code has changed significantly since then.</p>  <p>In my case, somehow the flags are not getting correctly propagated. What steps are necessary to increase the cache line sizes, propagate the flag bits to the caches, store/load the flag bits + data, ensure correct communication between caches, etc.?</p>  <p>Can you please let me know the files to be modified to incorporate these.</p>
