<p>Our team is planning a kind of image library service, and wants users to search images with filtering. (e.g. color, mood, size, geo, etc) So the images should be organised with tags.</p>  <p>The team couldn't have hired a developer yet, so we are collecting images first.</p>  <p>I guess if we can tag images while collecting them it would save much time, but have no idea about what tool would be compatible for building DB.</p>  <p>That is to say, I want to fetch tag information of the collection seamlessly into DB. Please recommend any method for the work.</p>
