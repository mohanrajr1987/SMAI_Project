<p>I'm having trouble finding a summation of all the weights associated with relationships.  If I have a graph and the distance between each node has a property called weight, say I wanted to find all the nodes and order by relationship weight.</p>  <h1>EDIT: ADDED RELATIONSHIP TO SECOND LINE</h1>  <pre><code>MATCH (album:Album)-[relationship]-(tags:Word) WITH album, COLLECT(tags) as tags, relationship WHERE ALL (v IN ["alpha", "bravo"] WHERE v IN EXTRACT(n in tags | n.name)) RETURN album,tags, relationship.weight as DISTANCE ORDER BY DISTANCE ASC LIMIT 15; </code></pre>  <p>why am I getting an error with this?  When I remove relationship it works just fine, but it says 'relationship not defined' when I add this.  I want to 'ORDER BY relationship DESC LIMIT 25'.  I mainly struggling with the implementation of relationship properties so I can create a weighted graph.  Thank you in advice for advice and consideration.</p>
