<p>I'm learning LISP and I am trying to write a function that adds 1 to each element inside my list. I first test for if the first element is a number or not then add 1 to the first element in the list. I then recursively call the function on the rest of the list but I get an error. Any help? Here's the function:</p>  <pre><code> (defun add-1-all (L)     (cond (not (numberp (first L)) nil)           (t (+1 (first L)) (add-1-all (rest L))))) </code></pre>
