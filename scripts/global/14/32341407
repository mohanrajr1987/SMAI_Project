<p>Lisp newbie here.</p>  <p>I created a function and put it into this file: compress.lisp</p>  <p>Now I want to load it into the Lisp interpreter that I am using, GCL-2.6.2-ANSI</p>  <p>Here's what I typed into the interpreter:</p>  <pre><code>(load "compress.lisp") </code></pre>  <p>The interpreter responds with this error:</p>  <pre><code>Error in EVAL [or a callee]: Cannot open the file compress.lisp.  Fast links are on: do (use-fast-links nil) for debugging Broken at CONDITIONS::CLCS-LOAD.  Type :H for Help.  1 (Continue) Retry loading file "compress.lisp".  2 (Abort) Return to top level. dbl:&gt;&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Is loading a file not allowed with GCL-2.6.2-ANSI? Or (more likely) I did something incorrect; if so, what?</p>
