<p>I'm studying SICP and at the beginning of section 2.2.2 it gives the following code: <code>(cons '(list 1 2) (list 3 4)))</code> and says it constructs a list like <code>((1 2) 3 4)</code>. But when I typed it into DrRacket(I'm using Racket here actually) it produces <code>'((list 1 2) 3 4)</code> and if I write <code>(cons (list 1 2) (list 3 4))</code> then it'll be alright. I know in Scheme <code>'(1 2)</code> is equal to <code>(list 1 2)</code> but what does <code>'(list 1 2)</code> mean?</p>
