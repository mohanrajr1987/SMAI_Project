<p>If I try to evaluate the expression <code>(expt 123456 123456)</code> in both Chicken Scheme (with the numbers extension) and Clisp it takes quite a long time (more in Clisp). So I thought that evaluating the expression <code>(/ (expt 123456 123456) (expt 123456 123456))</code> would take at least double that time, because the interpreter has to evaluate twice the power function and then has to evaluate a division. But, surprisingly, the answer in both interpreters comes out almost instantaneously.  What is going on?  How can it be possible?  Exactly, how is this expression evaluated?</p>
