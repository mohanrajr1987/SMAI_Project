<p>In Common Lisp, I can get a function to pass around with the <code>#'</code> syntax, like this:</p>  <pre><code>(let ((x #'+))  (funcall x 1 2)) </code></pre>  <p>But suppose I want to set a function so I don't have to use <code>funcall</code> for it. Does Common Lisp have a local function name table, or just the global one that is assigned to with <code>defun</code>?</p>  <p>Is there a way to assign to a function symbol other than <code>defun</code>? Or more generally: is there a way I can do something similar to this nonworking example:</p>  <pre><code>(setf #'x #'+) (x 1 2) </code></pre>
