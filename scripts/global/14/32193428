<p>I recently got into Scheme through Racket and I now want to use Chicken Scheme. Emacs seems to be pretty much the only option I have for developping in Scheme other than Racket so I boot up Emacs which I am not very good at.</p>  <p>I had previously set up emacs for SBCL using <a href="http://pchristensen.com/blog/articles/installing-sbcl-emacs-and-slime-on-windows-xp/" rel="nofollow">this</a> tutorial, but I am really not experienced with Emacs at all. (Note: I am on windows)</p>  <p><strong>What I did:</strong></p>  <ul> <li><p>I set up a unix-like file structure like the tutorial above described, and I installed Chicken-Scheme in Z:\home\myname\bin\chicken-iup</p></li> <li><p>I tried following the instructions on <a href="http://wiki.call-cc.org/emacs" rel="nofollow">this page</a> but there wasn't really much. It says I need quack but doesn't explain a lot, I just downloaded quack.el from the site and put it in my site-lisp folder</p></li> <li><p>I added the following lines to my .emacs folder</p>  <p>(setq scheme-program-name "csi -:c") (require 'quack)</p></li> <li><p>On the page linked previously, there is this snapshot, which is what I want to get to</p></li> </ul>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/kzhFD.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/kzhFD.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>You can see at the top there is a file open to write text and the REPL at the bottom, however, when I open emacs and do M-x run-scheme, I can't get that</p>  <p>I have two choices, M-x run-scheme and then "chicken" gives me the Chicken intro screen but immediately says "process finished"</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/SAIrv.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/SAIrv.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>On the other hand, M-x run-scheme csi just gives me a blank buffer with seemingly no REPL</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/gHRRo.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/gHRRo.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Running csi.exe directly in windows opens a console window with the intro text and the repl, but I want to have it in emacs like the first snapshot, which doesn't work</p>  <p>I've also tried chicken-slime SWANK backend but couldn't get it to work and searching google doesn't yield much help</p>  <p>So, does someone know what I need to do to be able to develop in Chicken Scheme in emacs</p>  <p>(Alternatively, if there are other Scheme environments for development outside of DrRacket I'd be interested to know, I haven't found much info apart from DrRacket or Emacs)</p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
