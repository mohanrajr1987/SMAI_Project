<p>I'm really curious why using "remove" isn't actually removing from the list, it would if I declared it in a variable, but then I have another variable to work with and it all becomes very messy, he is my code; </p>  <pre><code>    ;;;;Pig latin (defun pig-latin ()     (let ((word (read-line)))         (setf ind-characters (loop for char across word             collect char))             (setf first-char (car ind-characters))         (setf reversed-word (reverse ind-characters));flips the          (remove (last reversed-word) reversed-word)         (print reversed-word))) </code></pre>  <p>The output I get is:</p>  <pre><code>(#\d #\r #\o #\w) (#\d #\r #\o #\w) </code></pre>  <p>I would have expected the #\w to be removed from the second part of the output but it doesn't unless I declare it in a variable. How do I just work with a single piece of data and remove/add what I need to it without declaring a lot of variables?</p>
