<p>Alright, so I'm writing a program in Lisp to solve the tile puzzle (<a href="http://www.tilepuzzles.com/default.asp?p=12" rel="nofollow">http://www.tilepuzzles.com/default.asp?p=12</a>) and I have a problem with two of my functions. I have separate functions to "swap" the empty tile with the one above, below, left or right of it, but only the above and left are working. The only difference between the switch_above and switch_below is the use of a <code>+</code> in one and a <code>-</code> in the other (see code) and as far as I can tell that is what is causing a problem.</p>  <pre><code>;;Switches the Empty tile with whatever is above it (defun switch_above (state)   (let ((x (nth (- (find_empty state) 3) state)))    ;;Find the number that   is above the Empty tile, set as X     (setf (nth (find_empty state) state) x)          ;;Replace the Empty tile with X     (setf (nth (position x state) state) 'E)) state) ;;Put Empty tile where X was  ;;Switches the Empty tile with whatever is below it (defun switch_below (state)   (let ((x (nth (+ (find_empty state) 3) state)))    ;;Find the number that is below the Empty tile, set as X     (setf (nth (find_empty state) state) x)          ;;Replace the Empty tile with X     (setf (nth (position x state) state) 'E)) state) ;;Put Empty tile where X was </code></pre>  <p>The "state" list is set up like this: <code>(1 2 3 4 E 5 6 7 8)</code> where E is the empty tile</p>  <p><code>find_empty</code> returns the location of the empty tile, so it would return 4 in the above state.</p>  <p>As they are written <code>switch_above</code> works, but <code>switch_below</code> does not.</p>
