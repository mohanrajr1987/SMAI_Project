<p>I'm working on old exams to get ready for my own exam and the professor is nice enough to also give us the solutions to them and now I'm wondering why one function does what it's supposed to.</p>  <pre><code>(defun sortulists (L)   (mapcar (lambda (uliste)             (sort uliste (lambda (x1 x2)                            (or (symbolp x2)                                (and (numberp x1) (numberp x2)                                     (&lt; x1 x2))))))           L)) </code></pre>  <p>It's supposed to take a list <code>L</code> with unsorted sublists which might contain numbers and atoms and sort first it's numbers and put the symbols at the end.</p>  <p>When called like this <code>(sortulists  '((A  9  b  h  2)  (1  m  n  9  8)  (5  a  7)))</code> it returns <code>((2 9 H B A) (1 8 9 N M) (5 7 A))</code>.</p>  <p>Any help?</p>  <p>Edit: fixed indentation</p>
