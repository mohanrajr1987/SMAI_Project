<p>My question is pretty similar to this one: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3088831/how-to-evaluate-a-sequence-of-impure-functions-in-clojure">How to evaluate a sequence of impure functions in Clojure?</a> but instead of impure functions, how can I evaluate sequence of pure functions and get the results as another sequence?</p>  <p>Let's assume we have a vector of functions like:</p>  <pre><code>[#(str "a" "b") #(str "c" "d") #(str "e" "f")] </code></pre>  <p>And we need an output like this:</p>  <pre><code>("ab" "cd" "ef") </code></pre>  <p>I've tried something similar to this:</p>  <pre><code>(map eval [#(str "a" "b") #(str "c" "d") #(str "e" "f")]) </code></pre>  <p>but it just returns a vector of function references.</p>
