<p>I have this working bit of code</p>  <pre><code>(setq block_id nil) (setq myHash (make-hash-table :test 'equal)) (puthash "5" "a" myHash) (message (gethash "5" myHash)) </code></pre>  <p>it inserts a string in to the hash. and printss out "a" as its supposed to do. but how do I insert a list in to the hash? I tried</p>  <pre><code>(setq block_id nil) (setq myHash (make-hash-table :test 'equal)) (puthash "5" ("list foo" "baa" "baz") myHash) (message (gethash "5" myHash)) </code></pre>  <p>but I get a nil from the my emacs elisp repl.</p>
