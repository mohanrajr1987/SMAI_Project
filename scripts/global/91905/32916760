<p>I'm new to Android and making a very, very rough sketch of how my app will display information to users. I am making the app but not providing all the text it displays. </p>  <p>What I want to do is have multiple activities with a text box and underneath it have a button using the <code>oncreate</code> method (I believe the correct method) to have the exact same button on each activity linking back to main activity. What I want to do is make it so I don't have to recreate the intent or the button code on every page, just make a single line that does like "display button ID=home" on each activity. Just want to make it as simple as possible because I'll be making <em>a lot</em> of activities with text display.</p>  <p>When I figure it out I'm just going to drop the buttons and use a navigation drawer to access the info but need a draft for the team to start organizing the Information it displays. </p>  <p>I hope explaining what my final product will be can help show what I want to do. Thanks for any help in advance!</p>
