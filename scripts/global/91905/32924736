<p>After updated my Mac to OS X El Capitan 10.11.1 I couldn't create new virtual devices in Android Studio </p>  <p>From now, when I create a New Virtual Device and run my application I have the following message:</p>  <pre><code>&gt; emulator: The memory needed by this AVD exceeds the max specified in &gt; your HAXM configuration. HAXM is not working and emulator runs in &gt; emulation mode emulator: AVD      RAM size = 1024 MB emulator: HAXM &gt; max RAM size = 512 MB emulator: You might want to adjust your AVD RAM &gt; size and/or HAXM configuration to run in fast virt mode. emulator: &gt; emulator window was out of view and was recentered emulator: &gt; UpdateChecker: skipped version check </code></pre>  <p>I followed <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/29288735/2091181">this</a> answer to resolve the problem but when I try to installing it again I have the following message:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>HAXM silent installation only support mac OS X from 10.8 to 10.10 !</p> </blockquote>  <p>So, What is the proper way to install the HAXM kernel extension on 10.11 El Capitan?</p>
