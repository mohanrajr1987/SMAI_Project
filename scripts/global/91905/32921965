<p>I somehow can only view the first 100 of my array in the <code>Watches</code> window. The three dots likely represent that there is more to be shown but I cannot find out how to expand the window. As you can see the <code>size = 10000</code> so there really are more objects to be shown.</p>  <p>So how do I show these objects?</p>
