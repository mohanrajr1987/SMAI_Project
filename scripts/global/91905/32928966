<p>I have upgraded to Windows 10 and to latest version of studio (1.4). I'm trying to import a project I have been working on (it was working ok before).</p>  <p>I'm running into a critical error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>"Gradle 'Reiki' project refresh failed:   Error: Cause:<a href="https://downloads.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-2.2.1_all.zip" rel="nofollow">https://downloads.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-2.2.1_all.zip</a>"</p> </blockquote>  <p>Does anyone know how to fix this? I have spent a couple of hours looking at other studio gradle questions and answers and can't find this particular issue:.</p>  <p>The error code is below:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>2015-10-03 20:27:34,111 [  36960]   WARN - radle.project.ProjectSetUpTask -<br>   2015-10-03 20:27:34,112 [  36961]   INFO - radle.project.ProjectSetUpTask - >Cause: <a href="https://downloads.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-2.2.1_all.zip" rel="nofollow">https://downloads.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-2.2.1_all.zip</a></p>      <p>Consult IDE log for more details (Help | Show Log)    2015-10-03 20:27:34,112 [  36961]   INFO - ls.idea.gradle.GradleSyncState - >Sync with Gradle for project 'Reiki' failed: Cause: ><a href="https://downloads.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-2.2.1_all.zip" rel="nofollow">https://downloads.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-2.2.1_all.zip</a></p>      <p>Consult IDE log for more details (Help | Show Log)    2015-10-03 20:27:34,300 [  37149]   INFO -       #com.jetbrains.cidr.lang - >Clearing symbols finished in 0 s.    2015-10-03 20:27:34,300 [  37149]   INFO -       #com.jetbrains.cidr.lang - >Loading symbols finished in 0 s.    2015-10-03 20:27:34,300 [  37149]   INFO -       #com.jetbrains.cidr.lang - >Building symbols finished in 0 s.    2015-10-03 20:27:34,300 [  37149]   INFO -       #com.jetbrains.cidr.lang - >Saving symbols finished in 0 s. </p> </blockquote>
