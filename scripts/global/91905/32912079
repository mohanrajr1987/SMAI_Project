<p>IntelliJ and Android Studio have a - presumably - great "Translation Editor" where it shows you all the <code>&lt;string&gt;</code> entries of the <code>strings.xml</code> and you can add items and locales on the fly. It also shows which strings are not translated yet and offers a blank box to enter the translation</p>  <p>To use this rapidly, I would like to go from one string entry directly to the next without needing to switch to the mouse, hover around and double-click on the next item. It looks like this:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/khuqp.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/khuqp.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I thought this was rather obvious and a standard desire for users. I was surprised when I couldn't make it happen. I can move to the next row via <kbd>Enter</kbd> but that row is then only focused, not selected and I can't type. I tried <kbd>Enter</kbd> again, <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>, <kbd>F2</kbd> and many many many more keyboard combinations. Still no success</p>  <p><strong>So: How can I either move to the next item directly or select a focused item in the Translation Editor?</strong></p>  <p>My version is 14.1.4</p>
