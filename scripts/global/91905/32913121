<p>I am trying to use the Android Studio emulator on Windows 10.  I can't install the HAXM in the SDK folder because VT-x is not enabled.  I tried disabling the Secure Boot Control in the UEFI Firmware Settings.  I also tried turning off Hyper-V off in Windows Features on/off.  I also tried turning off the hardware visualization setting in Avast.  None of these are working and I am still unable to install HAXM.</p>
