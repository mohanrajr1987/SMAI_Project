<h1>issue:</h1>  <p>I'm trying to emulate a device using android studio but it doesn't display anything if I don't enable the <em>"Use host GPU"</em> option.</p>  <p>But <strong>Android Studio</strong> doesn't allow this option on android versions older than <strong>Kitkat</strong> (android 4.4) and I have to test an application on <strong>Gingerbread</strong> (android 2.3).</p>  <h1>info:</h1>  <p>I'm using a mac running under <strong>Yosemite</strong> (osx 10.10.5) and the <strong>version 1.4</strong> (latest AFAIK) of Android Studio</p>  <p>Does someone have a tip to make it work ?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
