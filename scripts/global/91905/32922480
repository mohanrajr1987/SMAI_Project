<p>hi its my first android project, i build my unsinged apk, i have no prior experience with certificates, follow tutorials from <a href="https://developer.android.com/tools/publishing/app-signing.html" rel="nofollow">android developer page</a> for signing my app, create a keystore using cmd <code>keytool -genkey -v -keystore c:\users\anita\my-release-key.keystore -alias alias_name -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000</code></p>  <p>tried to signed app <code>jarsigner -verbose -keystore my-release-key.keystore flying_birda.apk alias_name</code></p>  <p>jarsigner: certificate chain not found for (my alias_name). alias_name must reference a valid keystore key a private key and corresponding public key certificate chain.</p>  <p>i see a same problem  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23750259/certificate-chain-not-found-how-to-fix-and-publish-to-google-play-store">Certificate chain not found</a></p>  <p>is it a problem that my keystore have only a public key? if yes</p>  <p>then anyone can help me ho to make a complete key entry with a private key.</p>  <p>i am working it from last 2 days</p>  <p>but did not solve my problem.   how can I sign it properly outside eclipse or android studio? any help will be greatly appreciated</p>
