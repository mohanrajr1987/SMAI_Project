<p>I am trying to create an image asset in Android studio. I am facing problem at 2 levels. First, when I launch Asset Studio and select an image with Asset Type set as 'Launcher Icon', asset is created inside mipmap folder instead of drawable folder.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/K3db3.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/K3db3.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>So I changed Asset type to 'Action Bar and Tab icons'.But it causes image to appear as white blocks.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Stwt6.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Stwt6.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Please advise what I am supposed to do.</p>
