<p>I created an new Android project in Android Studio. </p>  <p>I have created an package under <code>src/main/java/</code> its name is <code>com.my.droid.shaker</code> . </p>  <p>But when I right click on the package &amp; create a new Java class, Android studio always create a new package with name <code>droid.my.com.shaker</code> &amp; put my new Java class under this new package. Same thing also happens for my AIDL file. </p>  <p>Why Android Studio do that? Why I can't create java class under my package <code>com.my.droid.shaker</code>. It is really annoying. Please help me to get rid of it.</p>
