<p>I have a trouble to add a package under one of the flavor folder in Android Studio: after I right click on the java folder and I could not see the 'Package' or 'Java Classes' options there!</p>  <p>I did exactly the same for another flavor and it was fine.. Now I am stuck here, without knowing if it is a bug in AS or I did anything there. Anyone help me please!</p>  <p>(I googled it and did not solve it with what I have found so far)</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/dFPWV.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/dFPWV.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
