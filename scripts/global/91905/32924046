<p>Today, I updated android studio 1.3.2(build 141.2178183) to 1.4.0(build 141.2288178).<br> After I clicked the <em>Update and Restart</em> button, it downloaded the patch file.<br> But then it went wrong when installing the files.  </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Some conflicts were found in the installation area.<br>   Some of the conflicts below do not have a solution, so the patch cannot be applied.  </p> </blockquote>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/s47Ty.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/s47Ty.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Reinstallation will solve this, because this is the second time I encounter this scenario, but it is not a good solution.<br> I also googled a lot, but none can solve it.<br> Help anyone can give me some help,many thanks in advance. </p>
