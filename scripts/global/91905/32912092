<p>I recently updated my Android Studio to version 1.4 and I noticed that every new project looks completely different. It has material design by default and CustomLayout instead of Relative. The problem is that I'm currently learning android development and I need old "template" for every new project to matching code in my book. My question is: It's possible to get old template for new projects in Android Studio 1.4?</p>
