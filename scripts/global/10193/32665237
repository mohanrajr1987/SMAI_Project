<p>I have a a fairly large text file  in which a string like the following one is repeated 50 times.</p>  <pre><code>NODE LABEL="NODE-1", LENGTH=(0.001,0.69, 1.805, 5, 10, \ </code></pre>  <p>The only difference between these repeated strings is the first number after the <code>=(</code>.</p>  <p>I mean the strings are as follows:</p>  <pre><code>NODE LABEL="NODE-1", LENGTH=(0.001,0.69, 1.805, 5, 10, \ NODE LABEL="NODE-2", LENGTH=(0.005,0.69, 1.805, 5, 10, \ NODE LABEL="NODE-3", LENGTH=(0.067,0.69, 1.805, 5, 10, \ </code></pre>  <p>I have a vector like the following one in MATLAB:</p>  <pre><code>d =[0.010     0.120     0.140] </code></pre>  <p>Firstly, I want to identify those lines that contain the above strings. Then, I need to replace the first number in each line of the text file with the corresponding number in the vector <code>d</code>. It means that, my output text file would look like  to :</p>  <pre><code>Bla Bla Bla Bla NODE LABEL="NODE-1", LENGTH=(0.010,0.69, 1.805, 5, 10, \ Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla NODE LABEL="NODE-2", LENGTH=(0.012,0.69, 1.805, 5, 10, \ Bla Bla Bla Bla NODE LABEL="NODE-3", LENGTH=(0.014,0.69, 1.805, 5, 10, \ </code></pre>  <p>How can I do it? </p>  <p>The essence of my question is that, how to find a string like <code>LENGTH=(NUMBER,</code> in a text file, while the <code>NUMBER</code> is not known.</p>
