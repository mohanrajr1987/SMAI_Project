<p><strong><em>Situation</em></strong></p>  <p>In my application i have a long text document and the user can search for words and the search engine highlights all the ocurrences and when you click next it will scroll to the next word (like windows browsers)</p>  <p>the problem is , when there is a lot of instances of that word, it takes too long to make the search and highlight all the words , on Old Android phones.</p>  <p>So i was thinking of an alternative, is there a way to only search for the first ocurrence, so it doesnt have to search all the document, and when i click next it just navigates to the next ocurrence?</p>  <p><strong><em>Here is my code</em></strong></p>  <pre><code>    int found = mCurrentWebView.findAll(find.toString()); </code></pre>  <p>And the code for , findNext..</p>  <pre><code>mCurrentWebView.findNext(true); </code></pre>
