<p>As a beginner with BASH I need some guidance.  I have 50k+ files across several domains of wordpress, all infected with a php intrusion. I managed to figure out a way to rid the php files of the virus. I just need to get the following script working and got stuck.</p>  <pre><code>#!/bin/bash for file in $(find . -name '*.php.VIRUS'); do sed -i 's/&lt;?php.*qhepxguxae*?&gt;//g' $file  mv "$file"  "${file/.VIRUS}" done  </code></pre>
