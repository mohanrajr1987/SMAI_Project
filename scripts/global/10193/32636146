<p>I have a NVR system that recording video surveilance into a linux server. This NVR system sometimes stops recordings (Bug) and I wanna know when that happens.</p>  <p>I'm looking into using the find command with a into a script and a cronjob to send me an email if no files is created within the passed 60 minutes.</p>  <p>The command I came up with is:</p>  <pre><code>find /path/to/folder/* -name "*.ts" -mmin +0 -mmin -60 -exec echo "No New Recording Available" \; | mail -s "PP-NVR" me@server.com </code></pre>  <p>But this command only sends me a list of "No New Recording Available" for the files older than 60 minutes</p>  <pre><code>No New Recordinf Available No New Recordinf Available No New Recordinf Available No New Recordinf Available No New Recordinf Available ... </code></pre>  <p>Can anyone please help!</p>  <p>EDIT: This is the script I came up with but it doesn't seem like it's working correctly:</p>  <pre><code>#!/bin/sh  if test 'find /path_to_folder/* -name "*.ts" -mmin +1 -mmin -10' then echo "No New Recording Available" | mail -s "PP-NVR" me@server.com fi </code></pre>
