<p>I have files with the extension .fastq.gz in multiple subdirectories.  </p>  <p>I would like to copy all of these files into one new directory.  </p>  <p>I tested with the following command, which seemed to work.</p>  <pre><code>$find . -name \*.fastq.gz -exec ls {} \; </code></pre>  <p>However, the following command didn't copy my files:</p>  <pre><code>$find . -name \*.fastq.gz -exec cp {} newdirectory \; </code></pre>  <p>Thanks for any help; I am very new to this.</p>
