<p>I am trying to find file names similar to this: <code>fsimage_0000000000501205926</code></p>  <p>This is what I tried :</p>  <p>works:  <code>find . -name 'fsimage_???????????????????' -mtime -1</code></p>  <p>Following another SO post I tried this and it doesn't work:</p>  <p><code>find . -regextype posix-extended -regex '^fsimage_[0-9]{19}' -mtime -1</code></p>  <p>*** EDIT: As suggested escaping the curly braces doesn't work either.</p>  <p>What I am doing wrong with the regex command ? I am using 4.4.2 GNU findutils.</p>
