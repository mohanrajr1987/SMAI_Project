<p>I'm not real good at macros/VB - I've had some experience that mostly amounts to struggling through writing a line while searching all over Google for examples.</p>  <p>I'm trying to write a macro function that will assign 12 items into an array and pass that array to its parent Sub (the main) (so I can put each array item into a cell in a different worksheet). The values are found by looking for "markers" in the first column (will always be "M1" through "M6" and will always be adjacent down the rows, but will <em>not</em> always have all 6 markers - sometimes there are less). Then I'm trying to grab the two values in the second and third columns next to each marker and plug each value into an item in the array.</p>  <p>What I'm down to at this point is finding "M1", resizing the range around it to include 6 rows total. Then my plan was to search within those 6 rows to see whether the left character begins with "M" and if it does to grab each of the two adjacent columns' values and plug them into two array items - and if not to assign "N/A" to all remaining array items.</p>  <p>Not sure if that's the best way, or if it even describes it well, but that's where I'm stuck - I don't know how to look in the cell to see if the left character is "M" and then copy the two adjacent columns' value into my array. Here's the code so far:</p>  <pre><code>Function GetMarkerArray() As String() 'grabs all the marker values present     ' from CSV or sets "N/A" if not and passes it along to the main sub for use. Dim markerArray(11) As String 'this will hold all the marker values Dim c As Integer 'create a quick counter variable     c = 1 'initiate the counter Dim a As Integer 'create a quick array counter variable     a = 0 'zero out the array counter Dim markerCell As Range 'this holds location of "M1" marker found Dim markRow As Integer 'this holds the row of each marker Dim cell As Range 'quick range value for lookup      With ActiveSheet.Range("a:a") 'doing things inside the active sheet of the CSV file     '====================================================================================     'find location of "M1" (the first marker) exapand the range, and store it. This range will be used later     'to find all marker values instances and assign each value next to it to an entry in the array or     'assign "N/A" for remaining array items w/o markers.     Set markerCell = Range("a:a").Find(What:="M1", LookIn:=xlValues, _                     LookAt:=xlPart, SearchOrder:=xlByRows, SearchDirection:=xlNext, _                     MatchCase:=False, SearchFormat:=False).Resize(6)             '====================             'temp - for testing             MsgBox markerCell.Address     '====================================================================================             markRow = markerCell.row 'set the row that "M1" was found in     End With      For c = 1 To markerCell.Rows.Count         'code: if left letter = "M" then             'markerArray(a) = cells(markerCell,2).value             'a = a + 1             'markerArray(a) = cells(markerCell,3).value             'a = a + 1         'code: else loop through remaining array items and set to "N/A"     Next c  GetMarkerArray = markerArray End Function </code></pre>  <p>Any ideas big or small are very much appreciated.</p>
