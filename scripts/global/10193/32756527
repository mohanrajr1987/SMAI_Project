<p>I have files mask below. with a very complicated file names. An example is show below. The unique identifier for the files is the number 0003915. I need to rename the file from </p>  <blockquote>   <p>From 'journal.pks.0003915&amp;representation=PDF'  to 'journal.pks.0003915.pdf' </p> </blockquote>  <p>However the most intresting thing is that I have about 5000 files in folders and subfolders. And I dont know these numbers. I know that there is a range of files from 0000001 to 0003915. What is show below is an example. The file mask is '0003915&amp;representation=PDF' I am looking for a way to modify the code below to do the Job.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>journal.pks.0003915&amp;representation=PDF</p> </blockquote>  <pre><code>#!/bin/bash  for file in $(find /tmp -name '*.txt')   do    mv $file $(echo "$file" | sed -r 's|.txt|.cpp|g')  done </code></pre>
