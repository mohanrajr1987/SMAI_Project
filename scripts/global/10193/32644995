<p>I am learning <code>JPA</code> using <code>EclipseLink</code>.<br> I searched a lot but did not found any answer. </p>  <p>My Question is when we use <code>EntityManager</code> <code>find()</code>, <code>remove()</code>, <code>persist()</code> methods how can we be sure that those methods worked as they are suppose to be.</p>  <p>For example if <code>persist()</code> persisted a row, if the insert did not happen for any reason will it return any error. </p>  <p>Similarly if <code>find()</code> has not found any data in database or <code>remove()</code> did not found the row to remove or did not removed because of constraints. </p>  <p>How can we handle these scenarios using exception handling?</p>
