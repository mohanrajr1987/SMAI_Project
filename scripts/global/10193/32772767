<p>Disclaimer:  I am a very early student and am struggling to learn java.  Please tell me if I'm leaving out any important information.</p>  <p>I am writing a program that prompts the user to do various operations to a linked list (add, remove, change value, etc.) but rather than storing a string or some primitive data type I am storing objects of type Student (which basically contains a string for the name of the student and an integer for their test score) and am stuck on how to find the maximum test score since I can't just find the highest Student.  </p>  <p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
