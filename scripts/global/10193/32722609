<p>Well, as the post title says, I need to find the (only) Hidden files that are executable by the Owner using <code>ls</code> or <code>find</code> command.</p>  <p>I was able to get these.. A command to find all the executable files</p>  <p><code>find &lt;dir&gt; -executable -type f</code></p>  <p>And, this one's to find all the hidden files</p>  <p><code>find . ".*" -ls</code></p>  <p>So, I was able to find the hidden files and executables but I couldn't filter only the hidden files that are executable by the Owner.</p>
