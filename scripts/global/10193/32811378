<p>I was wondering if there is a way to find files using the <code>find</code> tool in Terminal based on file's download time. I know there are options for access (<code>-amin</code>), creation (<code>-cmin</code>), and modified (<code>-mmin</code>), but can't figure out a way to filter files based on time they were downloaded.</p>  <p>I checked and the creation time was not same as it's download time. If <code>find</code> can't do it, what's my other best option.</p>
