<p>I have a EXCEL table consisting of a list of 100 points with the coordinates X Y Z. I want to find and replace certain X and Y coordinates, not just the X coordinate. </p>  <p>For example in the picture below,</p>  <p>I want to find all the points in my table which have <code>X=1</code> , <code>Y=2</code> and replace with <code>X=9</code>, <code>Y=9</code> . Not just find <code>X=1</code> and replace with <code>X=9</code> Because is has to match both X and Y coordinates. </p>
