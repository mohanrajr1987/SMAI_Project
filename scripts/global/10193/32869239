<p>I want to search within a table e.g.  </p>  <p>A B C<br> D E C<br> A H I<br> A H C<br> For the Values  </p>  <p>"A" and "C" and then put the Value "Value" into a cell in the rows where both Values have been found.<br> I am fairly new to the whole topic so i searched first on the web to find pieces of code that could help me. </p>  <pre><code>Dim FirstAddress As String Dim SecondAddress As String Dim MyArr As Variant Dim MyArr2 As Variant Dim Rng As Range Dim Row As Range Dim I As Long Dim B As Long With Application     .ScreenUpdating = False     .EnableEvents = False End With MyArr = Array("A") MyArr2 = Array("C") With Sheets("Sheet1").Range("F:F")     .Offset(0, 27).ClearContents     For I = LBound(MyArr) To UBound(MyArr)         Set Rng = .Find(What:=MyArr(I), After:=.Cells(.Cells.Count), LookIn:=xlValues, LookAt:=xlWhole, SearchOrder:=xlByRows, SearchDirection:=xlNext, MatchCase:=False)          If Not Rng Is Nothing Then             FirstAddress = Rng.Address             Do                     Set Rng2 = Rng.EntireRow.Find(What:=MyArr2(I), After:=.Cells(.Cells.Count), LookIn:=xlValues, LookAt:=xlWhole, SearchOrder:=xlByRows, SearchDirection:=xlNext, MatchCase:=False)                     If Not Row Is Nothing Then                         SecondAdress = Row.Address                         Do                             Rng.Offset(0, 27).Value = "Value"                             Set Row = .FindNext(Row)                  Set Rng = .FindNext(Rng)             Loop While Not Rng Is Nothing And Rng.Address &lt;&gt; FirstAddress         End If     Next I End With  With Application     .ScreenUpdating = True     .EnableEvents = True End With </code></pre>  <p>It worked for me searching for one value with the .find method, but i struggle to search for the rows that contain both values. (The Array in case i want to search for more than one value, say all that have at the beginning A Or D and then a C in the third column)</p>  <p>Do you have any idea? I dont get how i could implemented several loops.</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
