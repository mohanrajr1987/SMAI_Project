<p>I am a newbie to scripting and i need a little shell script doing the following:</p>  <ol> <li>find all .txt files they are older than x days </li> <li>delete them if they were not listed in logfiles (textfiles and gzipped textfiles)</li> </ol>  <p>I know the basics about <code>find -mtime</code>, <code>grep</code>, <code>zgrep</code>, etc., but it is very tricky for me to get this in a working script.</p>  <p>I tried something like this:</p>  <pre><code>#! /bin/sh for file in $(find /test/ -iname '*.txt')   do   echo "$file" ls -l "$file"   echo $(grep $file /test/log/log1) done </code></pre>
