<p>Hey so I have a string of letters (it's DNA) and I have a list of sliced up DNA that came from another sequence. I want to find all occurrences of any items in the list within my string. basically:</p>  <pre><code>data_1 = "ATGCTGCATGTCATGTGCTGATCTG" wild_type = ["A", "TG", "ATGC", "ATG", "TGCT", "GTA", "GTACT", "GT", "CT"] </code></pre>  <p>I want the output to be a list of indexes in data_1 where matches from wild_type were found.</p>  <p>Additionally, I want to find the longest piece that matches. So for the first part of the string, <code>A</code>, <code>ATG</code>, <code>ATGC</code> all match, so I don't need it to spit out <code>[0,1,2,3]</code>, but rather just <code>[0,3]</code> (a range)</p>  <p>I tried using finditer but i could not figure out how to put my list or string in there. Any help would be much appreciated!</p>
