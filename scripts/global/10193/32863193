<p>I have this set of similar lines which runs in my server.</p>  <pre><code>PATH = "/home/dept/files/"  for i in '**find . -newer $PATH$(ls $PATH)**'  do .. some set of codes.. done </code></pre>  <p>I am not getting how the find newer command works here. I saw that Find newer will return the files which are created after the specific time stamp. But I don't see any specific time stamp thats specified after the keyword <strong>newer</strong> in the find command. Please help me out how find -newer command works here. </p>
