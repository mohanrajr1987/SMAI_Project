<p>I unzipped a large collection of documents and forgot to tick 'keep directory structure', so now trying to remove all those files. The files are in my Downloads folder with no folder structures.</p>  <p>I have unzipped the file again in a different location and tried the following command to remove the flat files.</p>  <pre><code>for file in $(find . -type f -printf '~/Downloads/%f\n'); do rm $file; done </code></pre>  <p>It says cannot remove file as it doesn't exist, but if I copy the path it spits out into <code>rm</code> it finds and removes it fine.</p>  <pre><code>rm: cannot remove `/home/macpherson/Downloads/SN74LS14N': No such file or directory </code></pre>  <p>Same results with <code>xargs</code> </p>  <p>Any ideas?</p>  <p>Thanks Tom</p>
