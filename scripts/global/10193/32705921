<p>I'm trying to copy all files from a folder that start with a capital letter into another folder.</p>  <p>So far i've used the find command to actually find the files </p>  <pre><code>find /examplefolder -type f -name "[[:upper:]]*" </code></pre>  <p>and i'm able to find them no problem</p>  <p>I tried to just replace the find <code>command</code> with <code>cp</code> and that does not work then i tried to pipe into the <code>cp</code> command and I failed yet again</p>
