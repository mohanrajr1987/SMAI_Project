<p>I'm looking for a plugin or if it doesn't exist to create a plugin to show on the screen an unlock screen like for a samsung. I'm creating a webtool for a smartphone repair company and they capture the login from the customer but they need to insert this in a webtool and show the login code if needed. But with the android phones from Samsung you have a swipe login code. I would like to simulate this in my webtool.</p>  <p>Kind Regards,</p>  <p>Jasper Van Braekel</p>
