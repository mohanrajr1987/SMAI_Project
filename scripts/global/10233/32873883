<p>I am using the <a href="http://johnculviner.com/jquery-file-download-plugin-for-ajax-like-feature-rich-file-downloads/" rel="nofollow">jquery.fileDownload.js</a> jQuery plugin to download a file. I keep getting an error <code>$.fileDownload is not a function</code>. I have included the library and I see it being downloaded by the browser. It's placed after all the jquery files.. last one in the list. I am using the $.fileDownload and jQuery.fileDownload syntax to make sure there are no conflicts. I am using jQuery in other places in the site so I know it works fine. I tried a valid file url from the developer's site. I am also suspicious of the error because <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12267632/jquery-file-download-plugin">another question</a> posted the same error and the problem was the path format for the url they used even though the error message implies jQuery is not aware of the plugin.</p>  <p>Sample code used:</p>  <pre><code>var url = "http://jqueryfiledownload.apphb.com//FileDownload/DownloadReport/0";                 jQuery.fileDownload(url)                 .done(function () { alert('File download a success!'); })                 .fail(function () { alert('File download failed!'); }); </code></pre>
