<p>I should import this plug-in that is not present in bower: <a href="https://github.com/codrops/ImageTiltEffect/" rel="nofollow">ImageTiltEffect</a>, in my ember-cli app. I already created the sub-directory in the vendor directory, imported this in my Brocfile and added <code>"TiltFx": true</code> in my <code>.jshintrc</code> file. About the last point I am not very sure if it is done in the right way, btw my question is: after these steps, how can I use this plug-in? How can I call its init function from my ember code? Thank you in advance for the answers!</p>
