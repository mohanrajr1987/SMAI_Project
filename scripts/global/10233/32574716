<p>I have been beating my head against a wall here with this one for days. The nav sub-menus on this page <a href="http://perryluxe.com" rel="nofollow">perryluxe.com</a> will not go away on hover out. I have tried contacting the developer of the plugin, no response. I have downloaded the latest version of the plugin and ran through every combination of settings to try to get the sub menus to close.. no dice. I know this plugin is written in jquery but is it a possibility that I could add CCS to the menu to get it to function properly? At this point I will try anything to get it to work.</p>  <p>(plugin dev page here: <a href="http://www.designchemical.com/blog/index.php/wordpress-plugins/wordpress-plugin-jquery-vertical-accordion-menu-widget/" rel="nofollow">http://www.designchemical.com/blog/index.php/wordpress-plugins/wordpress-plugin-jquery-vertical-accordion-menu-widget/</a>)</p>
