<p>I want to know whether we have any jquery or javascript solution to convert html table to powerpoint.Only solution I got is <strong><a href="http://ngiriraj.com/pages/htmltable_export/demo.php">html table export</a></strong>. Here we have all the export options but I want solution only for powerpoint. I can use Html table export but my concern is, for one export i should use whole plugin. Is there a sample code only for ppt?</p>
