<p>I have seen some answers on how to set the value for a dropdown using jQuery. However in my case, I want to know how to use jQuery to set the text for a dropdown.</p>  <p>This example uses jQuery to set the value for my dropdown:        </p>  <pre><code>  var trimvalue ="345";    $("#Trim").val(trimvalue); </code></pre>  <p>In my current code Logic, I want to set the displayed text as well, which I tried to do in this way:</p>  <pre><code>var trimtext ="samsung";  $("#Trim").text(trimtext); </code></pre>  <p>This is not a correct syntax. Please provide any suggestions on whether we can set the the text using jQuery or not.</p>
