<p>Hi I want to design a website that should look like the sample site you can find from the link below:</p>  <pre><code>http://www.scdaarchitects.com/web/index.html </code></pre>  <p>The above mentioned website design is a bit different from conventional designs so I need some suggestions regarding the tools and jQuery plugins that will help me out to make this design. Any suggestions would be highly appreciated. Thanks.</p>
