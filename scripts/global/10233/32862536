<p>I'm using jquery text editor <a href="http://jqueryte.com/" rel="nofollow">jqte</a> to allow users to edit content of some text areas. Whenever I add large text to the editor the browser hangs for a while then after few seconds (sometimes 1 minute) it comes back to live again then it hangs again when you are scrolling or editing. I mean with the browser hangs is that you can't do anything to the page, you can't click any buttons or even scroll down or up in the page. I tried to put some large text in their <a href="http://jqueryte.com/demos" rel="nofollow">online demo</a> and this behavior happens. Is it a bug or just there is some parameter tuning that could solve the issue ?</p>  <blockquote>   <p><strong>Note</strong>: I didn't put any code snippets because using this editor is quite   simple and the behavior happens even on their online demo</p> </blockquote>
