<p>I am using the Cycle2 plugin with the Carousel extension. I have it set up as such:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div class="cycle-slideshow"        data-cycle-fx=carousel       data-cycle-timeout=3000       data-cycle-carousel-slide-dimension=300       data-cycle-carousel-visible=3       data-cycle-slides="&gt; a"      &gt; </code></pre>  <p>However, this is not working as expected.</p>  <p>Both the <code>data-cycle-carousel-slide-dimension=300</code> and <code>data-cycle-carousel-visible=3</code> are not being respected.</p>  <p>Further more, the carousel only cycles through once and doesnt loop and repeat.</p>  <p>Also, for some reason the div with class .cycle-slideshow is giving it's self a width of 900px (parent div is 1100px wide).</p>  <p>Both links to the .js files are correct and working.</p>  <p>Does anyone know what's going on here?</p>
