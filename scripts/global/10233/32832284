<p>I'm building a quiz and at the end of the quiz i want to have the question pagination. But instead of just showing the question numbers i also want to add a small image (with X or check mark to indicate whether the user answered correct or wrong) next to the numbers.</p>  <p>For example:</p>  <p>[1][2][3][4][5]</p>  <p>[x][v][v][x][x]</p>  <p>But i can't find a plugin that does that. all plugins i checked are only using numbers. add image is optional, i can also work with adding a class instead.</p>
