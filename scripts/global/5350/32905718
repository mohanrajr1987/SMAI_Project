<p>I basically want to mark the visited nodes of my graph and i was thinking of using the class as the key directly but it wasn't working. So, someone suggested that i should use a pair instead; so i have been trying to use that but that's also not working. My problem is as follows; i am being unable to insert values into the pair-key map i have made .</p>  <pre><code>class Node{ public:     int visited;     int a, b;     Node(int x,int y){a=x; b=y;} }  map&lt;pair &lt;int,Node&gt;,bool &gt;visited; </code></pre>  <p>How do i insert values? What is the best way of marking visited nodes in a graph?</p>
