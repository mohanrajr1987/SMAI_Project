<p>I'm making a game on Visual Studio on C# (in a console). It's about dialogues, and you can answer them with 2 choices, one key (for answering the first question) is 1 and the other one is 2. The problem is that when you press one key, you can´t press the other one no more, I mean, if you press 1, you can't press 2, and vice versa.</p>  <pre><code>static void Main(string[] args) {     Console.WriteLine("Press 1 or 2 please...");     //I know there are some errors in this code, i'm new at c#     ConsoleKeyInfo number1;     do     {         number1 = Console.ReadKey();         Console.WriteLine("Number 1 was pressed");         //This is the 1st answer     }     while (number1.Key != ConsoleKey.D1);     ConsoleKeyInfo number2;     //The problem is that when I already pressed D1 (1), I shouldn't be     //able to press D2 (2). And if I press D2 (2), I shoundn´t be able                   //to press D1 (1).     do     {         number2 = Console.ReadKey();         Console.WriteLine("Number 2 was pressed");         //This is the 2nd answer     }     while (number2.Key != ConsoleKey.D2);     Console.ReadLine(); }  </code></pre>
