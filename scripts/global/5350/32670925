<p>When I program, I am perfectly fine with using the standard letter keys, numbers and control buttons around the letters like <em>Ctrl</em>, <em>Shift</em>, <em>Tab</em>, etc...</p>  <p>But then I also often need to also use more <em>"distant"</em> keys like <em>Home</em>, <em>End</em>, <em>arrow keys</em>, etc.. for which you have to move your right palm quite a bit to the right.</p>  <p>This movement to the right to reach those keys seems so slow and so annoying, plus you then also need to place your right hand back on letter keys.</p>  <p>How do you deal with that?</p>
