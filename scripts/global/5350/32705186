<p>Not sure if I'm overlooking something really simple but I'm trying to make a program that allows a user to enter 1 of 2 letters and then run code based on the input. Seems simple enough but I've run into several errors with all the ways I thought this could work. Here is the code: </p>  <pre><code>string name = (Console.ReadLine()); Console.WriteLine("Is " + name + " ok?"); Console.WriteLine("\n(Y)es\n(N)o"); char ansys = Console.ReadKey(); if (ansys = ConsoleKey.Y)     Console.Clear(); else {     Console.WriteLine();     Console.WriteLine("Enter letters only"); } </code></pre>  <p>I added in the else portion (unfinished)just to get an idea if If i'm going the right direction with the intended goal as well. Would I be able to make an else statement that triggers if neither Y or N is pressed this way? </p>
