<p>I am new to this SSH and Bash, I am trying to know a remote SSH servers configuration for debugging purposes for e.g. to know what ciphers, MAC's, Algorithms, and length of the key that is been used by a remote server without logging in just by establishing the connection through  my bash script using </p>  <pre><code>ssh -vvv &lt;remote server&gt; </code></pre>  <p>with this command i am able to get details on ciphers, MACs, Key exchange algorithms but i am unable to find the length of the key, so similarly with a command i would like to find the length of the key without logging in to the remote server, if some one could walk me down this would be really helpful. Looking forwards, Thanks in advance</p>
