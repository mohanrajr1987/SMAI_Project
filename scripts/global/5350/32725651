<p>I am trying to capture all of key pressed in my program</p>  <pre><code>def keyPressEvent(self, event):      event = event.key()      if (event == QtCore.Qt.Key_Q):         print ('Q!.') </code></pre>  <p>That function works fine when i am trying to capture keys in my window. (in this case Q_Key)</p>  <p>But if the key was pressed in a Text Widget (for example in a: QListView, QlistWidget, QLineEdit, and so many more ) it don't work. The function prints nothing. I am doing something wrong... What can i do to fix it?</p>  <p>Thanks and sorry for my english!</p>
