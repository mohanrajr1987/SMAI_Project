<p>I am trying to install Apache Lucene 5.3.0 (from source). The mirror sites provide <code>lucene-5.3.0-src.tgz</code> and <code>lucene-5.3.0-src.tgz.asc</code> (the signature file), however the latter is using RSA key ID <code>3FCFDB3E</code> which is not contained in the <code>KEYS</code> file (which is also provided).</p>  <p><code>$ gpg --verify ./lucene-5.3.0-src.tgz.asc  gpg: assuming signed data in `./lucene-5.3.0-src.tgz' gpg: Signature made 2015-08-17T13:35:34 CEST using RSA key ID 3FCFDB3E gpg: Can't check signature: public key not found</code></p>  <p>The issue seems to be affecting multiple sites. What should the fingerprint be? Why is the key not included in the <code>KEYS</code> file?</p>
