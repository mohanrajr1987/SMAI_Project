<p>I am implementing custom keyboard using sample given in android sdk. In this example, the shift key(caps lock) is highlighted when we manually do caps lock by double tapping on it. But it does not show the caps indication when there is capsword input type in edit text. So anybody can help me about how can I implement it?</p>  <p>Any help is really very appreciated. Thanks you.</p>
