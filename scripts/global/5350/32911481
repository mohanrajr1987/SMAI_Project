<p>I have some data on a dictionary. Each key in the dictionary has several values, one of them is called 'state' which can be equal to Georgia, Washington, etc. I want to get the unique states. I tried doing this but I get an incorrect syntax error</p>  <pre><code>s = set( value for key in r value = key['state'] ) </code></pre>  <p>How can I get all the states?</p>  <p>Edit:</p>  <p>The data structure I have is actually a list of dictionaries so I want to get the values of r[0]['state'], r[1]['state'], etc and make an unique list.</p>
