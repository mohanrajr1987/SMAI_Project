<p>I was wondering if anyone could help out a clueless girl with a problem I'm having! </p>  <p>I am building a website and want to transfer over the data of a business facebook page (posts) and put it into a 'social wall' so to speak on the website. The problem that I am having is that it is copying the data from my own personal facebook account, rather than the facebook 'business pages' account. I cant seem to change it!</p>  <p>Please help. I am pulling out my hair hehe</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>  <p>Sophie</p>
