<p>I was given a .ppk file (which I know is only for putty). However, I have am using OS X Yosemite.</p>  <p>I followed this: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3475069/use-ppk-file-in-mac-terminal-to-connect-to-remote-connection-over-ssh">Use PPK file in Mac Terminal to connect to remote connection over SSH</a> to convert the .ppk file to a .pem file. This worked fine. However, when I double click the .pem file it says unable to import.</p>  <p>I need to import it because when I try to choose the certificate from network preferences on a VPN(L2TP), the certificate is not listed. What can I do to use the .ppk file so I can connect to the VPN?</p>
