<p>I have a URL that looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>https://host.com/imageviewer/namespace.001.587#page/1/mode/2down </code></pre>  <p>I need to generate a rails route for this such that I can get <code>namespace.001.587</code> out as the <code>id</code> and get it to route to the <code>ImageViewer#show_image</code> action, I also need to get <code>2down</code> as the mode, and <code>1</code> as the page.  Not being a clean RESTful URL, I'm finding this difficult to do in Rails. I'm only calling <code>GET</code> on this URL.</p>  <p>How would you generate this route?</p>
