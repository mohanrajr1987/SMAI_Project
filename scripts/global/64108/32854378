<p>I have a TagsController class, with a route like the following (in routes.rb)</p>  <pre><code>resources :tags </code></pre>  <p>Now, when I go to </p>  <pre><code>http://localhost:3000/tags/test </code></pre>  <p>It works correctly.</p>  <p>However, when I go to</p>  <pre><code>http://localhost:3000/tags/c++ </code></pre>  <p>Rails seems to be parsing the "c++" as "c ", so this results in a "404 Not Found"</p>  <p>Could anyone give me any instructions on how I could fix this?</p>
