<p>I have Student model, inheriting User model</p>  <blockquote>   <p>class Student &lt; User</p> </blockquote>  <p>if I add new field to Student, its not showing up. All I see is replica of User fields in Student table.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>rails g model User email:string name:string gender:boolean <br>   rails g model Student age:integer</p>      <p>rake db:migrate</p> </blockquote>  <p>User model :</p>  <blockquote>   <p>class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base <br>     validates :email, :name, presence: true <br>   end</p> </blockquote>  <p>then I replaced <br> class Student &lt; ActiveRecord::Base with</p>  <blockquote>   <p>class Student &lt; User <br>   end</p> </blockquote>  <p>now the :age field is replaced by :email, :name, :gender fields in Student table, I don't have access to :age field anymore</p>  <p>Student should have User fields as well as additional fields of its own. <br> how do I achieve this?</p>
