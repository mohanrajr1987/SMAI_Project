<p>I have new Rails project, in the project I have a controller, view and model named as <code>Customer</code>. Now, what I need is that beside the <code>CRUD</code> actions I need to add two new pages like:</p>  <pre><code>1. http://0.0.0.0:3000/Customer/sale  2. http://0.0.0.0:3000/Customer/lease </code></pre>  <p>And I want to insert code in these files. How do I achieve this I mean creating new <code>sale</code> and <code>lease</code> links?</p>
