<p>In my Ruby on Rails application, I am using Ajax through Rails' UJS (unobtrusive JavaScript).</p>  <p>It's perfectly working: when a user is on a Deal page, and when he then clicks on a certain textual link, the Ajax call is made and the modal with the distant content is loaded.</p>  <p><strong>But I'd like to give a way to users to arrive directly on the page WITH the modal ALREADY OPENED, without him needing to load the Deal page and then click on the textual link</strong>.  For example a user could receive en email and click on it and he would straight away arrive on Deal Page with the modal already opened.</p>  <p>But it's not working, when I take the route of the modal (see code below), and type in the browser <a href="http://myapp.com/deals/:id/deal_opportunities_modal" rel="nofollow">http://myapp.com/deals/:id/deal_opportunities_modal</a> , then it's giving the following error:</p>  <p>Completed 406 Not Acceptable in 29ms</p>  <p>ActionController::UnknownFormat - ActionController::UnknownFormat:   actionpack (4.2.0) lib/action_controller/metal/mime_responds.rb:218:in <code>respond_to'   app/controllers/deals_controller.rb:70:in</code>show_opportunities'</p>  <p>Here are my files:</p>  <p>controller/deals_controller.rb</p>  <pre><code># used so that old urls created for deals redirects to the new ones created # indeed with friendly_id, the url is taken from the title :/deals/title # but if we edit the deal title to deal/title2, the old url was still    working # we need to redirect the old url # source - github.com/norman/friendly_id/issues/385 before_filter :find_deal,    :only =&gt; [  :showcase ] before_filter :ensure_canonical_deal_path!,   :only =&gt; [  :showcase ]   def showcase         @deal = Deal.friendly.find(params[:id])         respond_to do |format|       format.html # showcase.html.erb       format.json { render json: @deal }     end end   def show_opportunities     @deal = Deal.friendly.find(params[:id])     @opportunity = Opportunity.where('deal_id = ?
