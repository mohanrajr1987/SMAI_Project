<p>I'm using Heroku, which means I have to upload <em>multiple</em> large files to S3 directly.. I'm using Rails 3.2.11, and Ruby 1.9.3.  I do not wish to use carrierwave or paperclip gems, or really change much at this point - I just need to get this what I have working.</p>  <p>Before trying to move to S3, if I ran my app locally,  I could upload multiple large files to the local file system.   When  I ran it  on Heroku, small files upload but large ones failed. Hence the switch to S3..</p>  <p>I tried several tweaks, and also this link below, but it's just too much of a change to what I have that <em>already</em> working with the local server's file system (and Heroku as well, but Heroku just can't handle large files ..)</p>  <p>Tried:  <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/direct-to-s3-image-uploads-in-rails" rel="nofollow">https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/direct-to-s3-image-uploads-in-rails</a></p>  <p>I've tried some of the other examples here on Stack Overflow but they are too much of a change for what works locally, and well, I don't grasp everything they are doing.</p>  <p>Now, what happens when I do try to upload images?</p>  <p>It's as if the file upload works - the preview images are successfully created, but nothing is ever uploaded to Amazon s3, and I don't receive any kind of error messages (like s3 authentication failure or anything.. nothing)</p>  <p>What do I need to change in order to get the files over to my s3 storage, and what can I write out to console to detect problems, if any, connecting to my s3?</p>  <p>My form:</p>  <pre><code>        &lt;%= form_for @status  do |f| %&gt;          {A FEW HTML FIELDS USED FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES - NOT IMPORTANT FOR THE QUESTION}          File:&lt;input id="fileupload"  multiple="multiple"  name="image"              type="file"  data-form-data = &lt;%= @s3_direct_post.fields%&gt;              data-url= &lt;%= @s3_direct_post.url %&gt;              data-host =&lt;%=URI.parse(@s3_direct_post.url).host%&gt; &gt;            &lt;%= link_to 'submit', "#", :id=&gt;'submit' , :remote=&gt;true%&gt;          &lt;% end %&gt; </code></pre>  <p>My jquery is:</p>  <pre><code>....   $('#fileupload').fileupload({       formData: {                  batch: createUUID(),                   authenticity_token:$('meta[name="csrf-token"]').attr('content')                     },       dataType: 'json',       acceptFileTypes: /(\.|\/)(gif|jpe?g|png)$/i,               maxFileSize: 5000000, // 5 MB               previewMaxWidth: 400,               previewMaxHeight: 400,               previewCrop: true,       add: function (e, data) {        tmpImg.src = URL.createObjectURL(data.files[0]) ; // create image preview        $('#'+ fn + '_inner' ).append(tmpImg);      ... </code></pre>  <p>My controller:</p>  <pre><code>def index #it's in the index just to simplify getting it working    @s3_direct_post = S3_BUCKET.presigned_post(key: "uploads/#{SecureRandom.uuid}/${filename}", success_action_status: '201', acl: 'public-read')  end </code></pre>  <p>The element that is generated for the form is (via Inspect Element):</p>  <pre><code>        &lt;input id="fileupload" multiple="multiple" name="image"      data-form-data="{&amp;quot;key&amp;quot;=&gt;&amp;quot;uploads/34a64607-8d1b-4704-806b-159ecc47745e/${filename}&amp;quot;," &amp;quot;success_action_status&amp;quot;="     &gt;&amp;quot;201&amp;quot;," &amp;quot;acl&amp;quot;="&gt;&amp;quot;public-read&amp;quot;," &amp;quot;policy&amp;quot;="&gt;&amp;quot;[encryped stuff - no need to post]&amp;quot;,"      &amp;quot;x-amz-credential&amp;quot;="&gt;&amp;quot; [AWS access key]/[some number]/us-east-1/s3/aws4_request&amp;quot; ," &amp;quot;x-amz-algorithm&amp;quot;="&gt;&amp;quot;AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;quot; ," &amp;quot;x-amz-date&amp;quot;="&gt;&amp;quot;20150924T234656Z&amp;quot; ," &amp;quot;x-amz-signature&amp;quot;="&gt;&amp;quot;[some encrypted stuff]&amp;quot;}" data-url="https://nunyabizness.s3.amazonaws.com" data-host="nunyabizness.s3.amazonaws.com" type="file"&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Help!</p>
