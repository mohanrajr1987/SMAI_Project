<p>I have a pretty simple Ruby On Rails app with bootstrap 3 for the front end: I have Deals, and each Deal has_many Opportunities.</p>  <p>On each Deal page (url of deal page is for example myapp.com/id=1), I want to have a textual link that says "view deal's opportunities" and when clicked, it trigger when clicked the appearance of content inside a Bootstrap modal.</p>  <p>I'm getting all mixed up because on this Deal Page, I use Deal's controller action called "showcase". BUT to generate the modal via ajax,as you see below, I use another action called "show_opportunities" and inside it, the app seems not to know @deal (because@deal is defined in a different Deal's action). <strong>I think that where the problem comes form but I am not totally sure.</strong></p>  <p>Here is the error I am getting and my code:</p>  <pre><code>Completed 404 Not Found in 3ms  ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound - Couldn't find Deal without an ID:  activerecord (4.2.0) lib/active_record/relation/finder_methods.rb:433:in `find_with_ids'   activerecord (4.2.0) lib/active_record/relation/finder_methods.rb:71:in `find'   friendly_id (5.1.0) lib/friendly_id/finder_methods.rb:20:in `find'   app/controllers/deals_controller.rb:70:in `show_opportunities' </code></pre>  <p>This line where 70 with the error is "@deal = Deal.friendly.find(params[:id])" (see below)</p>  <pre><code>controller/deals_controller.rb (using @Pavan feedback)     # used so that old urls created for deals redirects to the new ones created     # indeed with friendly_id, the url is taken from the title :/deals/title     # but if we edit the deal title to deal/title2, the old url was still    working     # we need to redirect the old url     # source - github.com/norman/friendly_id/issues/385     before_filter :find_deal,        :only =&gt; [  :showcase ]     before_filter :ensure_canonical_deal_path!,       :only =&gt; [  :showcase ]   def showcase         @deal = Deal.friendly.find(params[:id])         respond_to do |format|       format.html # showcase.html.erb       format.json { render json: @deal }     end end   def show_opportunities     @deal = Deal.friendly.find(params[:deal])     @opportunity = Opportunity.where('deal_id = ?

I can't give the same url to all the links 'view opportunities' that would appear in all the diffreent Deal pages(id=1, id=2,...). </p>  <p>So I changed the route to:</p>  <pre><code> match '/deals/:id/opportunity_modal',  to: 'deals#show_opportunities',  via: 'get',  as: :deal_opportunities_modal </code></pre>  <p>and it works!!!</p>
