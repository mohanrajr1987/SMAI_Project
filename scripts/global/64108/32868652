<p>in a Rails 3 application there are two models assinged to each other by <strong>belongs_to</strong> and <strong>has_one</strong>. On both sides there is <strong>:depended => :destroy</strong> configured for this association.  now I had to add a <strong>:before_destroy</strong> callback in one of these models. the problem is now that this callback is triggered twice when an entity which includes this callback is destroyed. When I remove <strong>:depended => :destroy</strong> in the other model, it's triggered only once. So it seems this i causing the problem. </p>  <p>is there an elegant way to fix this ?</p>
