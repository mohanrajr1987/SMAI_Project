<p>I have generated cucumber report but I wanted to override Header which says "Cucumber Features" to use the environment variables defined which should look like "NAME1 NAME2 are the reports"</p>  <p>I am reading the arguments into an environment variable in ruby in env.rb file</p>  <p>appname1 = ENV['appname1'] appname2 = ENV['appname2']</p>  <p>cucumber appname1="NAME1" appname2="NAME2" -p features_01</p>  <p>I have looked into <a href="https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Custom-Formatters" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Custom-Formatters</a> I am confused on how to use this to override the header.</p>  <p>Is it possible to override the header?</p>  <p>Could anyone please help me with this?</p>
