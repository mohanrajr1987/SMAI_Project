<p>I am stuck with a problem to implement a feature in a photo social app which I am learning to build.</p>  <p>I was wondering of adding a hashtag system to captions. The model scans it, create collections automagically and through a separate controller and display like an album and also have the ability of searching for all photos of all users matching that tags.</p>  <p>I got stuck on the first part of it, scanning for tags and storing it somewhere. I created a new app having post with hashtags and trying to scan through regex  - <code>post.scan(/\B#\w\w+/)</code>.</p>  <p>Thats all I could progress. Coudn't use it anywhere in the controller or model, it keeps saying <code>MoMethod error "scan"</code>.</p>  <p>After that how can I store that array somewhere and do rest of the work - which is mostly like a common tagging system.</p>  <p>Model Class name is <strong>Photo</strong> having attributes - post and hashtag.</p>  <pre><code>def hashtag(post)     hashtag_regex = /\B#\w\w+/     @show = post.scan(hashtag_regex) end </code></pre>  <p>Controller</p>  <pre><code>def index     @post = Photo.all     @show = Photo.hashtag(@post) end </code></pre>
