<p>I have an Android App written using Xamarin for Visual Studio.  When it runs I get the warning:</p>  <p>Failure getting entry for 0x01080acd (t=7 e=2765) (error -75)</p>  <p>I know there is something wrong with one of my resources, but I can't seem to figure out which resource has the ID of 0x01080acd.  I tried looking at it while debugging in the activity OnCreate method, but it doesn't seem to work.  Any suggestions on how I might track this down?</p>  <p>Jim</p>
