<p>Xamarin Studio was working perfect for me this morning, created a hello world app with no problem. </p>  <p>Then I started developing an App, when I tried to build it gave me back a warning about missing Xamarin.Android. Also, Up to this point, I was able to open options, and under projects was the SDK locations folder where you specify your SDK, NDK and Java files. This folder has now disappeared. </p>  <p>I cannot change my emulator to the Xamarin Player or any others it's just stuck on default, none of my previous projects will run or newly created ones. I have uninstalled xamarin and tried reinstalling it to no avail.</p>  <p>Visual studio works perfectly running the solutions even using the Xamarin Player. I would much prefer to use Xamarin Studio for my fourth year project. </p>  <p>Any help with this would be much appreciated. </p>  <p>I also seen something about Xamarin is now running on Microsoft.Net mode in options, I can't create a mobile app the way I could this morning. It only gives me options to build in asp and one other.</p>
