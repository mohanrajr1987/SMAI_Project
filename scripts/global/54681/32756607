<p>I am currently working on a app, which requires users to login using ADFS. I have pulled down the android bindings library from <a href="https://github.com/AzureADSamples/NativeClient-Xamarin-Android" rel="nofollow">NativeClient-Xamarin-Android</a> then followed the tutorial provided by Mat Velloso on his blog: <a href="http://www.matvelloso.com/2014/07/02/adal-bindings-xamarin-android-applications-ultimate-guide/" rel="nofollow">adal-bindings-xamarin-android-guide by Mat Velloso</a> This works fine. The issue I am having is when I run the app and when the app tries to acquire token at this point a web view is displayed to the user (which should show allow the user to login). However in my case on SAMSUNG XCOVER 3 I am displayed a blank screen (There is a quick flash to show there is something rendering). Then I tried on another mobile device SAMSUNG S5 to make sure this is not just a mobile specific issue. With SAMSUNG S5 I was displayed the full page however If i clicked on the input for username or password. The screen would go blank.</p>  <pre><code>     try         {             DefaultTokenCacheStore cache = new DefaultTokenCacheStore(this);             context = new AuthenticationContext(this, AadAuthority, true, cache);              context.AcquireToken(this, AadResource, AadClientID, AadRedirect, "", new AdalCallback(this));         }      catch (Exception ex)         {             throw new Exception(ex.Message);         } </code></pre>  <p>The above code is slightly different to runing a windows app. As the AcquireToken is a void method in this case. </p>  <p>So my question is how do I make sure the I don't have the rendering issue on Samsung XCover 3 (this device is the targeted device)? </p>  <p>Are there any alternative suggestions? As I have to use ADFS.</p>
