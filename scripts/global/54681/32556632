<p>I've created a new Xamarin.Android app and added a few assets to it. Those assets are available in multiple resolutions, so I placed them in their respective <code>drawable-XXX</code>folders inside the <code>Resources</code> folder. Doing so resulted in the following error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The project 'XXXX.fsproj' could not be opened because opening it   would cause a folder to be rendered multiple times in the solution   explorer. One such problematic item is 'Resource\drawable-hdpi\pencil.png'</p> </blockquote>  <p>This is being caused by F#'s poor folder structure handling. I usually don't need to use folders at all in F# projects, but in this specific case it's necessary because of the way Android deals with resources. The project loads fine in Xamarin Studio, but in Visual Studio it doesn't.</p>  <p>The project is quite big, what means I (and other people as well) will need to add a lot of files, so manual approaches <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/28361170/3465182">like this one</a> are of no use, for they're too time consuming.</p>  <p>I read the <a href="https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/fsharp/fsharp_support_overview/" rel="nofollow">official docs</a> but there's nothing there that states there's a special way to handle adding files on VS or another way to deal with this limitation. My question is: such thing exists? Can I add those files in another way so that I don't need the complex structure on VS? Will I be forced to use C# or Xamarin Studio against my will?</p>
