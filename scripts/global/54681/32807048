<p>I trying to animate a fragment transaction so that the new fragment appears to slide in from the bottom and overlay the existing fragment. So it basically feels like the new fragment is on top of the previous fragment.</p>  <p>The closest I've gotten at the minute is:</p>  <pre><code>transaction.SetCustomAnimations(Resource.Animation.abc_slide_in_bottom, Resource.Animation.abc_slide_out_top, Resource.Animation.abc_slide_in_top, Resource.Animation.abc_slide_out_bottom); </code></pre>  <p><em>The effect of this is that the new fragment pushes the old fragment off the top of the screen.</em></p>  <p>Can anybody point me in the right direction? I'm also not sure what level of support the built in animations have with regard API levels and the compatibility library?</p>
