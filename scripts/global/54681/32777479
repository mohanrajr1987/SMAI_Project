<p>I can see in in the Android documentation that it has a library to round corners etc etc, it is RoundedBitmapDrawable , and I see it has a setCircular method. <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/graphics/drawable/RoundedBitmapDrawable.html#setCircular(boolean)" rel="nofollow">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/graphics/drawable/RoundedBitmapDrawable.html#setCircular(boolean)</a></p>  <p>I see that Class in Xamarin Android. But I cant find this method or something like that (Circular, SetCircular), class is in the Xamarin Android support Library: <a href="https://components.xamarin.com/view/xamandroidsupportv4-18" rel="nofollow">https://components.xamarin.com/view/xamandroidsupportv4-18</a></p>  <p>Anybody know why or if am I wrong? Has Xamarin Android library a 1:1 equivalence with Android or there a lot of cases like that?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
