<p>I want to install Xamarin for Android Development in Visual Studio 2015 Enterprise.</p>  <p>While installing, Xamarin told me that I was missing a lot of features, so it would download and install them for me. The download size was around 2GB, and I have a really slow internet.</p>  <p>I wanted to know if there is a way to download Xamarin and all required components separately, using some download manager like IDM, and then be able to use it later to re-install/install on another PC.</p>  <p>Also, I was able to find offline setups for JRE and JDK, and also Android Studio and Android SDK/NDK, but still, the download size is around 1.5GB, which I presume is for the required Android SDK libraries, APIs and tools.</p>  <p>So, I am just asking for a guide on downloading all the components and store them for installing later.</p>
