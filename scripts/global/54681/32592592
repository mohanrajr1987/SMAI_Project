<p>I am following along with the getting started tutorial: </p>  <blockquote>   <p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-service-mobile-dotnet-backend-xamarin-android-get-started-preview/" rel="nofollow">https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-service-mobile-dotnet-backend-xamarin-android-get-started-preview/</a></p> </blockquote>  <p>I can successfully work the steps up through "Publish your server project to Azure".  However, when I download, open and build the <code>Xamarin.Android</code> app I have issues.  Specifically, the output window says the build was successful, but the error window indicates that there are 14 errors, all of which are <code>CS0012</code>.  </p>  <p>I understand that the "System.Runtime" assembly isn't being referenced, but no solutions I have been able to identify on <code>MSDN</code> or on <code>StackExchange</code> seem to correct the issue.</p>  <p>Any help would be appreciated!</p>
