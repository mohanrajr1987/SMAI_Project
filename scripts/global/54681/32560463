<p>At the moment I have an app which allows user to send data to a restful webapi, whilst connected to the internet, but this app should also work offline. Thus I am storing user actions in a SQLlite database. This information should be persisted to the webapi when the mobile device finds internet connection. I have implemented </p>  <pre><code>public bool IsConnected(){          var connectivityManager = (ConnectivityManager)GetSystemService (ConnectivityService);         var activeConnection = connectivityManager.ActiveNetworkInfo;          if ((activeConnection != null) &amp;&amp; activeConnection.IsConnected) {             return true;         }          return false; } </code></pre>  <p>This is called by the OnCreateOptionMenu() of every activity. Which works fine. However when I place a webapi request, which is sadly synchronous call causes the app to display a blank screen until it has processed this. Now this is the user experience I would like to replace with, something similar like ASYNC (asynchronus) request, which works everything in the background without any interruption. But I am struggling to implement this. I did have a Sync button on the app home screen, which onclick ran async call however I do not trust the app users to press this button. Hence I would like to trigger this work in the background. Can someone please advise?</p>
