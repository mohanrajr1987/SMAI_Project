<p>I have a Xamarin.Android application that I've configured for GCM using <a href="http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/application_fundamentals/notifications/android/remote_notifications_in_android/" rel="nofollow">this Xamarin guide</a> The app is able to receive the notifications this way. BUT, when I put the GCM API key in notification Hub, and send the notification via Azure, its not received in the app.</p>  <p>The app registers with GCM. Do I need to register with Azure Notification Hub? If yes, how?</p>
