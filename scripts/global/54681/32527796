<p>I had really weird bug in Android application. I use same color across multiple views background in application. I change one view background color alpha on touch event:</p>  <pre><code>    void SlidingPanel_PanelSlide(object sender, SlidingUpPanelLayout.PanelSlideEventArgs e)     {         float expandedFactor = e.P1;         int targetAlpha =(int)( 255f - (255f)*expandedFactor);          var currentToolbarColor = toolbar.Background as ColorDrawable;         currentToolbarColor.Alpha = targetAlpha;     } </code></pre>  <p>..and that works. However when I add new fragment (with <code>SupportFragmentManager</code>) it's main view gets background with same alpha as <code>toolbar</code> (check snippet).</p>  <p>I managed to fix that (changed a bit background view color) and I suspect that is caused by sharing same color across multiple views. Question is: are resources singletons (same instances in whole application)? What kind of resources are shared in Android ?</p>
