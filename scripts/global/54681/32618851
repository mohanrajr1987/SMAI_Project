<p>I am trying to create a new Blank App (Android) in Visual Studio 2015 with installed Xamarin, Android SDK and Android emulator. When trying to create a new Project, I just get a popup with the message: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Value cannot be null. Parameter name: path1</p> </blockquote>  <p>Solution Explorer is empty and just a empty folder is created in Projects folder. </p>  <p>How can I solve it?</p>
