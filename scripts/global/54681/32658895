<p>I have created project PaypalDroid to make it as android binding project. But when I compile I got 3 error</p>  <p>1 'Y': member names cannot be the same as their enclosing type</p>  <ol start="2"> <li><p>'N': member names cannot be the same as their enclosing type</p></li> <li><p>The type or namespace name 'Widget' does not exist in the namespace 'Com.Paypal.Android' (are you missing an assembly reference?)</p></li> </ol>  <p>For number 3 problem I know the problem is exist because the namespace problem. This is the generated code</p>  <pre><code>public IList&lt;Android.Widget.TextView&gt; C { //Some Code } </code></pre>  <p>How can I make the property type to global::Android.Widget.TextView ? And for number 1 and number 2 I don't know how to get rid of it...</p>
