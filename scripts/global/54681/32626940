<p>I want to develop a android application using Xamarin C#. So I have installed Visual Studio 2015. I have also installed Xamarin Android Player 64bit. Now when I tried to run android device from XAP I got this error.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Failed to inialize device Nexus 4 (jelly Bean)</p>      <p>VBoxManage command failed. see log for further details.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I am using Windows 7 64bit version.</p>
