<p>I have a clean install of Windows 10. After installing Visual Studio 2015 and Xamarin Bussiness edition I installed <strong>Xamarin Android Player</strong> x64 and now I receive the following error:</p>  <pre><code>Error when attempting to find VirtualBox please check it's installed and try again. Xamarin Android Player will now exit. </code></pre>  <p>A solution is referenced in <a href="https://forums.xamarin.com/discussion/47551/after-fresh-install-on-windows-10-it-says-unable-to-find-virtualbox" rel="nofollow">Xamarin fourms</a> stating </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Fixed it by adding "C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox" to my %PATH%</p> </blockquote>  <p>I am able to open VirtualBox version 4.3.28 r 100309 without issue.</p>  <p>How do I implment this solution or is there a newer solution?</p>
