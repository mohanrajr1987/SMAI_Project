<p>Is the .so files generated by Xamarin Monodroid (<code>libmonodroid.so</code> and <code>libmonosgen-2.0.so</code>) managed code or native code? From <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19072897/xamarin-android-does-native-code-compilation-make-reverse-engineering-harder">this SO post</a> it appears they are actually .NET IL binaries (not native machine code). An answer even suggested the Xamarin.Android binaries is JIT'ed and can be opened in any .NET decompiler. However, this doesn't seem to work with dotPeak or ILSpy based on my investigation.</p>  <p>However, <a href="http://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/4624/how-do-i-reverse-engineer-so-files-found-in-android-apks">this other post</a> on another SE site appears to contradict this. It should be noted that they are referring to Android NDK in general. So, should the native library be opened on a .NET decompiler or dissembler such as Hopper and IDA Pro (giving you assembly code)?</p>
