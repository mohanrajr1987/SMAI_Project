<p>I have an interface </p>  <pre><code>public interface ToMock{  public boolean isWorkingFine(); } </code></pre>  <p>Now, I have an implementation for this interface: <code>RealWorldImpl.java</code> This interface is used by another class and so I would like to provide a mock implementation for this interface where I can return values as required for various functions. </p>  <p>So basically when my interface is called, I would like the values returned from a mocked implementation: <code>MockedImpl.java</code></p>  <p>This is required for a Android Library project (I am still using Eclipse with ADT). I tried Mockito but it doesn't seem to work and gives me an error. </p>  <p>Could someone please help?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
