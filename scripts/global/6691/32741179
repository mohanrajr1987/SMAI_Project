<p>I'm creating a library for Universal Windows Platform apps (<code>"Microsoft.NETCore.UniversalWindowsPlatform": "5.0.0"</code> under <code>dependencies</code> and <code>"uap10.0": {}</code> under <code>frameworks</code> in <code>project.json</code>). I just started writing tests, but I can't seem to find any mocking library which would support the Universal Windows Platform apps. The only one is <a href="https://moqalate.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">MoqaLate</a>, but it's very new and severely limited.</p>  <p>I can't see myself testing without mocks, but I'm also new to UWP development. Am I missing something, or it really is impossible to use mocks in my tests? If so, what are alternatives?</p>  <p>Edit: One alternative I see is to develop Windows Class Library (Portable) which would target only Windows Universal 10.0. Is there any gotcha with this approach I should be careful about? My goal is to have a library that can be used in Windows 10 apps (on mobile, desktop and xbox).</p>
