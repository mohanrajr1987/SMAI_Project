<p>Just wondering if anyone has a good solution for updating mocked calls within a protractor test. I need to be able to mock a call (which I can do using ngMockE2E) but the next time the call is made, I want it to come back with different results.</p>  <pre><code>httpbackend.when('GET', ....URL....).respond(200, results); </code></pre>  <p>where <code>results</code> is a json object that is returned.</p>  <p>The first time the call is made it is coming back with the correct json. But within the same test, I want to update those results so that the next time the call is made, it returns the updated json.</p>  <p>Thoughts?</p>
