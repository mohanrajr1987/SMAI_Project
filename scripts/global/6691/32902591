<p>I would like to know how to mock (at least I think I need to do this) an instance of another object to pass test? Because when I launch test I get an error that <em>getInstance</em> is not a function. When inserting debugger in property getter which I am testing I see that mObjects contain two functions (the ones I am interested in actually), but one should be an instance so that it has all the methods and properties. </p>  <p>My getter which I am testing:</p>  <pre><code>myModule = function(self) {     var oProtected = self.oProtected || {};     Object.defineProperty(Instance.prototype, "property", {         get : function() {             var FOO = oProtected.mObjects.AnotherObject.getInstance();             return FOO.activeWindow.oPrivate.props().PROPERTY;         }     }); } </code></pre>  <p>test:</p>  <pre><code>assert.ok(this.Instance.property, "instance property available."); </code></pre>
