<p>Say my SUT is a BubbleMachine which creates itself some instances of Bubble objects to use internally. However, I want it to use my MockBubble's instead .. What do I do?</p>  <p>Solutions:</p>  <ol> <li><p>Use an intermediate class BubbleFactory which I can pass to the BubbleMachine. That way I can give it a MockBubbleFactory instead.</p></li> <li><p>As I'm using a lang which allows it, set some string on the BubbleMachine that tells it which class to instantiate for it's Bubble objects. E.g. $bubbleMachine->setBubbleClass('path/to/MockBubble.class')</p></li> <li><p>Just have a setBubbleObject(..) kind of function  on BubbleMachine to which I pass my MockBubble. The BubbleMachine then just recycles that object instance every time it wants to do a bubble.</p></li> </ol>  <p>Any 3 of these would work for my current problem but I suspect they may make some unit testing professionals a bit uncomfortable.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
