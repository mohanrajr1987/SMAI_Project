<p>I am trying to use mock library for testing a piece of the code. In this code, the user raw input is accepted in a for loop as shown below. I have written the test case <code>test_apple_record</code> that can feed a single user input value for the tray number. </p>  <p>But, for every iteration within the for loop, it just takes this same value (5) as expected.  </p>  <p>Question is: How to feed different values for each iteration? for example, specific values of 5, 6, and 7 for the tray numbers for i=0, 1 and 2 respectively. </p>  <pre><code>class SomeClass(unittest.TestCase):         def apple_counter(self):         apple_record = {}         for i in range(3):             apple_tray = input("enter tray number:")             apple_record[apple_tray]  =  (i+1)*10             print("i=%d, apple_record=%s"%(i, apple_record))      def test_apple_record(self):         with mock.patch('builtins.input', return_value='5'):             self.apple_counter() </code></pre>
