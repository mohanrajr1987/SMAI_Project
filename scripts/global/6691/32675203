<p>Is it possible to validate the actual paramater received by a mock objects method parameter? I cannot do a direct comparison because i'm using Fabricate and converting the object into a serialised format.</p>  <p>for example:</p>  <pre><code>expect(user).to have_received(:add).with(valid_user()) </code></pre>  <p>so in that case <code>valid_user()</code> would accept the parameter, validate and return a boolean, to verify a valid value was passed into <code>user.add()</code></p>  <p>can something like that be done?</p>  <p>So far I've been reading the documentation in <a href="https://github.com/rspec/rspec-mocks" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/rspec/rspec-mocks</a> regarding Argument Matchers</p>  <p>Edit: in my specific case, the argument is a quite large string. I would like to validate that the string is valid by potentially running a regex against the string. So i would like to run the argument through a validation method which simply returns true/false. </p>
