<p>I am having a hard time figuring out how to do this.</p>  <p>I am using google.map.places.Autocomplete and its all working fine, but due to app/screen sizes the pac-container with the returned search listings is behind the devices virtual keyboard - and thus on about half of the devices I have tested the user can't see the returned address list.  Obviously you don't want the pac-container in front of the keyboard because then various keyboard keys will be hidden.</p>  <p>How can I force the pac-container to appear above (and scroll up) the search/input box?</p>
