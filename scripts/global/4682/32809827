<p>This example of autocomplete with JCombobBox is very good. <a href="http://www.algosome.com/articles/java-jcombobox-autocomplete.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.algosome.com/articles/java-jcombobox-autocomplete.html</a></p>  <p>However, there is a rather strange behavior, that I can't explain and a fortiori changed. The content of the input field appears first item in the JComboBox, as "ca" above "canadian" in the image of the example, when you search a word starting with "ca...". I think the problem is the following lines of the class AutocompleteJComboBox :</p>  <pre><code>//if founds contains the search text, then only add once.  if ( !foundSet.contains( tc.getText().toLowerCase()) ){    addItem( tc.getText() );    } </code></pre>  <p>I tried to remove them, but then as soon as I enter the first letter, a word (the first who matches) of my list is selected and displayed in the input field without even the comboBox was opened, and then I have at all the possibility of writing in the field. I also tried just remove the line who add and just make a print instead, but like when I remove all the lines, I can't write anymore in the field.</p>  <p>thank you in advance for your assistance.</p>
