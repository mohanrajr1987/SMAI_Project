<p>I am using the <a href="https://github.com/hoteltonight/HTAutocompleteTextField" rel="nofollow">HTAutocompleteTextField</a> class to autofill textfields as the user types.  The documentation recommends using this throughout a project. I'm using the version known as <code>AutocompleteTypeColor</code> where the datasource is an array drawn from core data -- as opposed to the other version where it just autocompletes email addresses.  (Color has nothing to do with color, it just means non-email.)</p>  <p>The problem I'm having is how to use this in multiple places in my project as the <code>HTAutocompleteManager</code> class at the heart of the control,  instantiates the class for the view controller that wants to use it as follows:</p>  <pre><code>else if (textField.autocompleteType == HTAutocompleteTypeColor)     {         static dispatch_once_t colorOnceToken;         static NSArray *colorAutocompleteArray;         IDAddVC *instance = [[IDAddName alloc] init];         dispatch_once(&amp;colorOnceToken, ^         {             colorAutocompleteArray = [instance getNames]; </code></pre>  <p>Where in this case <code>IDAddVC</code> is my VC class and <code>getNames</code> is a method that pulls names from core data.</p>  <p>Can anyone suggest how to make the code modular by separating this call to a specific class from one of the core files you import for the control to run?</p>
