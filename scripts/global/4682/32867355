<p>I'm using <a href="http://autocompletejs.com/" rel="nofollow">http://autocompletejs.com/</a> and my client is asking if certain words can be excluded, or as they say, "treated as neutral", and not trigger the autocomplete box from displaying.</p>  <p>In other words, let's say the following items are in my list:</p>  <ul> <li>Tree Green</li> <li>Tree Red</li> <li>Tree Real</li> <li>Tree Fake</li> <li>Tree Tall</li> <li>Tree Trunk</li> <li>Plant Green</li> <li>Plant Bush</li> </ul>  <p>They want the results to display with Tree/Plant as the first word, but typing Tree or Plant should not trigger the list.  The user would have to type "Tree R" before any results appear.  Or they can type "R" to see the results that contain R in the second word.</p>  <p>I can't set minLength because they also want the user to be able to enter "Re" to see the Red/Real results.</p>  <p>Another way around this would be ignoring the first word of all items on my list.</p>  <p>Any ideas?</p>
