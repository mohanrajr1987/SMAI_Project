<p>Let's say in example i have a controller with couple of actions. In each action i define $entityManager = $this->getEntityManager(); I will like IDE to autocomplete it in every new action i am creating.</p>  <p>I am aware, that IDE could have two options: - autocomplete each variable name defined in file - or autocomplete each variable name defined in project</p>  <p>Is that possible?</p>
