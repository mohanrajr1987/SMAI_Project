<p>I have a simple DataGridView:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/1FXBx.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/1FXBx.png" alt="DataGridView"></a></p>  <p>I have a class:</p>  <pre><code>public class TemplateItem {     public string Name { get; set; }     public decimal Price { get; set; } } </code></pre>  <p>And a list to store templates:</p>  <pre><code>List&lt;TemplateItem&gt; templates = new List&lt;TemplateItem&gt;(); // Some code to populate the list </code></pre>  <p>For the "Name" cell in the grid, I want to:</p>  <ul> <li>display autocomplete options from the <code>templates</code> list when the user types in the cell</li> <li>automatically set the "Price" cell to the price of the autocomplete option that the user has selected (the user can change the price afterwards)</li> <li>allow the user to type in something not available in the <code>templates</code> list</li> </ul>  <p>I know how to enable autocomplete by using EditingControlShowing event, like in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7225290/textbox-autocomplete-in-a-datagridview-winform">this question</a>.</p>  <p>I don't know how to detect the selection of an autocomplete option. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26642981/how-get-event-item-selected-with-autocomplete-in-c">Using KeyDown event</a> doesn't work for me - it never fires.</p>  <p>And I don't know how to get the price of the selected option. Supposing I was able to catch the "option selected" event, I could go through the templates and find the one with the same name... but that seems ugly code to me. I should be able to pass the information about the price for each option somehow, right?</p>
