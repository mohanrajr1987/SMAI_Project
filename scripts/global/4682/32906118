<p>Using google.maps.places.Autocomplete correctly lists multiple address selections.  However I am seeing that simply tapping/pressing the desired option isn't actually selecting that option...it appears to do a select but its not selecting and filling that option into the input field.  If I do a long press on the option then it will auto-populate the input field.  </p>  <p>How can I change this behavior so that a simple tap/press selects and populates the appropriate listing into the input field?</p>  <p>I am using Javascript as I haven't taken the time to convert over to jQuery yet...please be nice.  :-)</p>
