<p>I'm using the Google maps Places API V3 auto-complete (google.maps.places.SearchBox) and I added following listener to it :</p>  <pre><code>searchBox = new google.maps.places.SearchBox(input);      //not available at start, will be set later.     //updateGoogleAutoCompleteSearchBoundFromMap();     //listener if the user selected a poi or text     searchBox.addListener('places_changed', function() {             ... </code></pre>  <p>So I'm wondering now the search box gives me concrete places and then search term auto-complete. No matter what I choose in the list, I get an array with places object with a places id. Can I differentiate somehow if a user selected a search term or a concrete places id? </p>  <p>Because I would like to act different then. I couldn't find anything in the documentation so I'm afraid I'm not able to differentiate.... </p>  <p>Because if the user picks a concrete place, I want to show that place and only that place. If not, I would like to use the search term for something else.</p>
