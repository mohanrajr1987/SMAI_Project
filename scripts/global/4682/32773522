<p>I have my anaconda package installed with package installer for Sublime Text 3. The autocompletion feature takes ~ 2-4 seconds after "." to show available options. Has anyone encountered this, if so can you please advise if there is a method to correct this?</p>  <p>I am using a MAC for reference. Thanks!</p>
