<p>I pass a list of words to Scintilla's <strong>SCI_AUTOCSHOW</strong> that looks like <code>"word? another-word! etc"</code> but it's displayed as <code>"word another-word etc"</code>, question mark and exclamation mark are gone. I've added them as valid word characters with <strong>SCI_SETWORDCHARS</strong> but that doesn't help. How can I force the autocomplete to show them?</p>
