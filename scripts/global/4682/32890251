<p>I am using google.maps.places.Autocomplete in my mobile app as part of an input field at the bottom of the screen.  when the user focuses on the input field the virtual keyboard appears shortening the app in order to fit the keyboard.  When this happens though the places.Autocomplete suggestions appear beneath the keyboard.  Obviously, you don't want to place the suggestions in front of the keyboard because then the keys are obstructed.</p>  <p>My thought is to place the suggestions above the input field but I can't figure out how to do this.  It appears this is possible but I haven't found a coherent way to manage this problem.  I am using Javascript (haven't converted to jQuery yet - yes, I know, let the flaming begin).   </p>  <p>Is there another way to manage this problem so the suggestions aren't covered by the keyboard?</p>
