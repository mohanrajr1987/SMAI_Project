<p>I am using a multiple autocomplete. I add some 4-5 items in multi autocomplete box. Is it possible to add an item in the middle (say between 2nd &amp; 3rd item)</p>  <p>As we see in gmail, in the To field when we specify multiple emails, its possible to drag an email id item to any where in the list.</p>  <p>I tried in PF Showcase for multi-autocomplete where its not possible to drag or add an item between, instead we need to remove all items to the position where we need to add the new one.</p>  <p>Please reply. Thanks in advance.</p>
