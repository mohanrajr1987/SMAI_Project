<p>I am trying to use amazon cloudsearch to implement search functionality.</p>  <p>It uses set of key:value pair to represent a document. A suggester can be defined that will give auto complete suggestions based on the values of a particular key. It searched the given query as a prefix for the values of the key specified.</p>  <p>I have searched its <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/latest/developerguide/getting-suggestions.html" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>. I want to enable auto complete suggestions also from the middle of a value of a field. Can i enable this on amazon cloudsearch?</p>
