<p>I have developed a windows phone 8 application. I have a developer account and unlocked device. Now I'm able to deploy/install the application in my phone through windows phone development sdk.</p>  <p>Now I want to install this application in another device ( a device of my friend, who is in different location). I don't want to put this application in the app store. I want to mail the XAP file only to him. So is there any other way to install this (XAP file) application in his mobile.</p>  <p>I am looking forward your responses.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
