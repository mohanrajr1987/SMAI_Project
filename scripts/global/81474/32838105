<p>I have <code>cordova 5.3.3</code> and my app is already working very well for Android. Now I'm trying to build it for <code>Windows Phone 8</code> and <code>Windows Phone 8.1</code>. The problem is that I found out that some <code>.css</code> files are not loaded (I'm running the app with both emulator and device with Visual Studio 2013 on Windows 8.1 x64).</p>  <p>How can I debug the app to find what files are not loaded during app running?</p>  <p>I tried to use <code>ripple-emulator</code> (<a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-ripple" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/apache/incubator-ripple</a>) but I think it does not work with Internet Explorer on Windows or maybe I can't make it work (I already use it on Linux with Chromium and the Android platform and it works).</p>  <p>I also tried to use <code>Visual Studio 2013</code>: I have opened the <code>.sln</code> file in <code>/platforms/wp8</code> and ran the app, so I have whatched the output console, but I think that it does not help me because I could not find the informations I need about the <code>.css</code> files that are not loaded.</p>  <p>Any help please? Thanks</p>
