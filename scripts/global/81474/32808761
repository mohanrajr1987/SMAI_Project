<p>I am working on Windows Universal application using Apache Cordova. When I debug or run my application it shows an 'Hamburger Icon' on the top-left corner of the title-bar (Header) which consists of 2 options (Share and Settings).</p>  <p>How can I remove this icon? I am at the beginner level and searched on internet for this issue but didn't find any suitable answer.</p>  <p>Kindly ask if you didn't get the question.</p>  <p>Thanks;</p>
