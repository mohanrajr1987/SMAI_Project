<p>I am developing a <code>Windows Phone 8.1</code> application where I have a list page with a ton of data items.</p>  <p>So I decided to implement incremental loading on ListBox. And fortunately I got a solution on it from Danial vaugan's <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/228873/Loading-Data-when-the-User-Scrolls-to-the-End-of" rel="nofollow">Loading Data when the User Scrolls to the End of a List in Windows Phone 7</a> sample</p>  <p>And it works well with scrolling. But noticed that after 5 or 6 incremental loading, the Scrollviewer offset change is not working. Since then the concept is not working. </p>  <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1XMRqRHI1TXZmRGdExUdDhDeU0/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is my sample of the Daniel Vaughan's sample project where it loads only 79 items. After that the scroll change is not working. </p>  <p>Is there any limitation to ScrollViewer to prevent it's offset from changing after certain value? But I don't think so because I loaded more than 1000 items at once and it smoothly scrolls till the end.</p>  <p>How to resolve this issue? </p>
