<p>I have used <code>Visual Studio 2012</code> to create a new project based on the "Windows Phone Direct3D with XAML" template. I need two-way communication of variables and functions between the XAML (C#) portion and the DirectX (C++) portion.</p>  <p>I can communicate in the XAML->DirectX direction via the Direct3DBackground (m_d3dBackground) object, which is accessible from MainPage.xaml.cs.</p>  <p><strong>Is it possible to do this in the reverse (DirectX->XAML) direction</strong>? Does the Direct3DBackground container have any knowledge of the XAML page it's embedded in?</p>  <p><strong>Alternatively</strong>: As a poor man's substitute, can I set up an event on the XAML page that fires on each frame and polls for changes in Direct3DBackground's member variables?</p>
