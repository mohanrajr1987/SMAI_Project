<p>I have this requirement where I need to show a custom popUp as a page overlay. This custom PopUp is random and can show up on any page (based on some logic). I have registered the <code>OnBackKeyPress</code> event (for the current page) in this custom PopUp class. </p>  <p>But because almost all the pages of app also has an <code>OnBackKeyPress</code> method defined (again as per business requirement), the new event registration (in the custom PopUp class) takes place after the previous one. So on pressing the hardware back key, the <code>OnBackKeyPress</code> method written in pages is getting called first followed by the <code>OnBackKeyPress</code> method written in custom PopUp class. I need to avoid calling <code>OnBackKeyPress</code> method written in pages.</p>  <p><strong>Solutions not acceptable</strong> : </p>  <ol> <li>make the new popUp control as a <code>PhoneApplicationPage</code> (we need some transparency where we can show the current page's data)</li> <li>Put check on <code>OnBackKeyPress</code> method on all pages for the popUp (so many pages in ap!)</li> <li>Extend <code>PhoneApplicationPage</code> and write a new <code>OnBackKeyPress</code> method to handle the same (no no!)</li> </ol>
