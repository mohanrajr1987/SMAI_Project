<p>this is my code block</p>  <pre><code>&lt;grid&gt;    &lt;button name="button" click="button_click"/&gt;    &lt;border background="black" opacity="0.2"/&gt; &lt;/grid&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I want to use the button that is under border layer but it's not possible because border has its own tap event Is there a way to use this button click event when the border is on top of it?</p>
