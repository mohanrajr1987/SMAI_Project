<p>I am migrating a Windows Phone 7.8  application from to Windows Phone 8.1 Silverlight - and ultimately possibly to Windows Phone 10.. </p>  <p>But now I am stuck in a triviality of not getting Background Audio Player to work in Windows Phone 8.1 Silverlight at all.  This probably is something obvious  - but after  a few days of experimentation I am running out of ideas.</p>  <p>What happens is that I get error message </p>  <p>System.InvalidOperationException: E_FAIL -2146233079 </p>  <p>from player when setting audio track.</p>  <p>Essential code snippets</p>  <pre><code>public partial class MainPage : PhoneApplicationPage {     BackgroundAudioPlayer player;     Uri _trackUri;     Uri _albumArtUri;     string _trackUriString = "http://podcast.cbc.ca/mp3/hourlynews.mp3";     string _albumArtUriString = "http://www.cbc.ca/podcasting/images/promo-hourlies.jpg";     string _trackAlbum = "Album - Podcast news";     string _trackArtist = "Artist - CBC";     string _trackTitle = "Track title - Hourly news";     string _tag = "testtag";     public MainPage()     {         InitializeComponent();     }     private void PhoneApplicationPage_Loaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)     {         player = BackgroundAudioPlayer.Instance;         _trackUri = new Uri(_trackUriString, UriKind.Absolute);         _albumArtUri = new Uri(_albumArtUriString, UriKind.Absolute);     }     private void SetTrack_button_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)     {         player.Track = createTrack();       // player gets error after this statement     }     private AudioTrack createTrack()     {         return new AudioTrack(_trackUri, _trackTitle, _trackArtist, _trackAlbum, _albumArtUri, _tag, EnabledPlayerControls.All);     } </code></pre>  <p>I created this in VisualStudio 2015 Community solution with two Silverlight 8.1 projects using the built in templates. And yes, background audio project is referenced from main program.</p>  <p>To check my sanity I created - in a similar way - a WP7.8 project using VS12 Express. And copied the code over from VS15 side. That application works fine. </p>  <p>Ideas appreciated - very much</p>
