<p>I have a Mobile First Application including Android, iOS and Windows environment. The application works fine on the Android and iOS emulators, but it doesn't work on the Windows 8 emulators. I was debugging the problem and found out that I'm able to connect to .wlapp but I'm not able to connect to the adapters (through which I could hit the web services).</p>  <p>Any idea where I'm wrong.</p>
