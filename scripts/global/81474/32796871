<p>I have Page2 that connects to page3 which in turn connects to page5. </p>  <p>Page5 is the last page and it has a button to return to the mainpage (page2 in this example) and its works fine but when I press the back button (phone hardware button) on page 2 it goes back to Page5. </p>  <p>how do i stop/avoid the back button pressed on page2 taking user to page 5? </p>  <p>sorry for my english :(</p>
