<p><strong>Current State</strong></p>  <p>In an WP 8.1 Silverlight app I use the OneDrive API (LiveSDK version 5.6.3). The scope is defined as follows:</p>  <pre><code>private static readonly string[] Scopes = {"wl.signin", "wl.skydrive_update"}; </code></pre>  <p>Whenever a user tries to log in he is asked to provide, apart from access to OneDrive, information like name, gender, display picture, contacts &amp; friends. The app actually doesn't need that information. According to the documentation <code>wl.basic</code> is required to get such information.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/hd0Bk.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/hd0Bk.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p><strong>Actual Question</strong> </p>  <p>How can I prevent the OneDrive API from asking for permission to get name, gender, display picture, contacts and friends. Users often ask and sometimes give bad reviews because of that.</p>
