<p>I have developed an app using Sencha Touch 2.4.1 and built using Cordova 3.5.0-0.2.7 for Windows Phones. The app make https OData requests to a Server with valid and Trusted SSL certificate, but these requests are failing in WP8.1 with Status Code 0 and Status Text as blank.</p>  <p>It works fine with http protocol in WP8.1 and http/https in WP8.0 as well. Below is a sample code with two buttons-One calls HTTP service(Working) while another calls HTTPS service(Not Working):</p>  <pre><code>{     xtype: 'button',     text: 'HTTP',     handler: function(b, e){         var storeRef = Ext.getStore('ODataStore');         storeRef.getProxy().setUrl("http://myDomain:80/SAP/Odata_Service");         storeRef.load();     } }, {     xtype: 'button',     text: 'HTTPS',     handler: function(b, e){         var storeRef = Ext.getStore('ODataStore');         storeRef.getProxy().setUrl("https://myDomain:443/SAP/Odata_Service");         storeRef.load();     } } </code></pre>  <p>I think it has to do something with Cordova code. I've seen a few posts with similar problems but no concrete solution.</p>
