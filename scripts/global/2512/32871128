<p>I have a project where I want to create calendars for a set of users. </p>  <p><em>These calendars should be private to the users authorized to view/edit the calendar.</em></p>  <p>Look at the <strong>Google Calendar API</strong>, this seems possible (i.e. App creates a calendar then registers users to it if I'm not mistaken)</p>  <p>Now, I may have many, many groups of users, and will need to create many calendars. </p>  <p><strong>I need to know how many of those shared calendars I can create.</strong> I have asked on Google Forum but got no answer. There is no information about quotas on Calendars in the docs... So, does anyone know if there is a limit to the number of calendars an App can create?</p>  <p>I don't want to build a system based on an API and later realize I can't grow! If someone with experience with the Google Calendar API have input on how to do this, I'm also taker.</p>  <p>Thanks for your input.</p>
