<p>I got the following code on the back of my calendar:</p>  <pre><code>// I get this from ajax (start month + end of the month) $post_date_start = $_POST['date_start']; // start month (always), ie: 2015-09-01 $post_date_ending = $_POST['date_ending']; // end month (always), ie: 2015-09-31  // If I get an event which its duration its between $post_date_start and $post_date ending it works properly as you can see: SELECT * FROM calendar WHERE start_date &gt;= '$post_date_start' AND ending_date &lt;= '$post_date_ending'  </code></pre>  <p><strong>The problem</strong>: it actually returns the results within' these range properly. But if the <code>start_date</code> or <code>ending_date</code> it is not exactly within this range, it will not return anything.</p>  <p>For example, an event starting on 07-09-2015 and ending on 08-12-2015. It should be displayed on september, october, november and december...). The question is... having those two parameters, how can I do to display the event on every month/year? Thanks!</p>
