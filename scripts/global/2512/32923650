<p>I'm creating a public calendar and I'd like to let users easily subscribe to it. I know how to subscribe to public calendars in the calendar clients settings, but I'm not confident that my demographics would know how to do that. The users I spoke to preferred to import the calendar by just opening the .ics file.</p>  <p>I noticed the .ics file has a <code>URI</code> and <code>LAST MODIFIED</code> directive, so I'm curious if the calendar client uses this to check for updates.</p>
