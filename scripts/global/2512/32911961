<p>Maybe there is a smarter way of resolving my issue so my question might not be pointing you into the right direction of thinking.</p>  <p>However, my issue is that I want to initialize my <code>Calendar</code> instance only once at the beginning of the program, so I work with only that date and time.</p>  <p>Then I want to pass that calendar to a method which adds/subtracts some months/days from it and uses that datetime for an API call. The thing is, I want to reuse the initial date all over in different places of my application, but that method keeps changing my <code>Calendar</code> instance.</p>  <p>CODE:</p>  <p>Initialization of the <code>Calendar</code> on the beginning of the main thread:</p>  <pre><code>Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance(); </code></pre>  <p>Method using the instance:</p>  <pre><code>private static String getDateUntil(int i, Calendar cal) {     int month = 0 - i;     //Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance();     cal.add(Calendar.MONTH, month);     Date result = cal.getTime();     String dateUntil = new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd'T'hh:mm:ss").format(result);      return dateUntil; } </code></pre>  <p>After calling this method, my <code>cal</code> is changed and I can't reuse the initial datetime. Any ideas?</p>
