<p>I'm building a calendar which also displays a one week "view".</p>  <p>Having some trouble with the "last week" and "next week" nav...</p>  <p>Here's what I've got:</p>  <pre><code>/*    Date to calc the start and end of week.    $thisYear, $thisMonth, $thisDay are passed in */  $combineDate = $thisYear . "-" . $thisMonth . "-" . $thisDay . " 00:00:00"; //$timeString = strtotime($combineDate); (tried with this format, but same result)  //calculate last week's date $lastWeek_year = date('Y',strtotime("$combineDate -1 week")); $lastWeek_month = date('n',strtotime("$combineDate -1 week")); $lastWeek_day = date('j',strtotime("$combineDate -1 week"));  //calculate next week's date $nextWeek_year = date('Y',strtotime("$combineDate +1 week")); $nextWeek_month = date('n',strtotime("$combineDate +1 week")); $nextWeek_day = date('j',strtotime("$combineDate +1 week"));  [links look like this:] //last week &lt;a href="$currentPage?day=$lastWeek_day&amp;month=$lastWeek_month&amp;year=$lastWeek_year"&gt;  //next week &lt;a href="$currentPage?day=$nextWeek_day&amp;month=$nextWeek_month&amp;year=$nextWeek_year"&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Works beautifully for the current month and next month as the end of October (2015) and beginning of November fall on a Saturday and Sunday (respectively)!</p>  <p>But it breaks in December, because the 1st is a Tuesday (doh!)</p>  <p>And it breaks when going from 2015 to 2016..</p>  <p>I've tried several different approaches using strtotime...</p>  <p>Anyone got a clean solution?</p>  <p>Many thanks!</p>
