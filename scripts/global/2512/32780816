We have a user in the office that wants to filter her calendar events, that when she views the calendar of her boss she will only sees updates made in the meeting by the event owner and her bosses updates should not be shown.</p>  <p>Tried to filter this using outlook rules and Conditional Formatting but was not able to find a solution to the task. Can anyone suggest best approach for this ?</p>
