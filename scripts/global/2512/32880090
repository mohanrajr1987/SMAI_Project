<p>I am new to PHP and I have a question on how to echo a financial year.</p>  <p>For echo of calendar year, I use:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php echo date("y"); ?&gt; </code></pre>  <p>My financial year starts on 1 July of the previous calendar year and concludes on 30 June, and I want to echo the financial year. </p>  <p>I have no any idea how I can do it. I searched for answers to this problem but I cannot find an easy solution for me.</p>  <p><strong>Expected output</strong></p>  <p>If it is sometime in June 2015, I want to print <code>2015</code> as the year, and it would then print <code>2016</code> starting on the first day of the following month.</p>
