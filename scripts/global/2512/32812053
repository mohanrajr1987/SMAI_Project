<p>I'm creating an appointment for the calendar of windows 10 using develop for wup  (Windows Universal Platform) just like this</p>  <pre><code> String appointmentId = await Windows.ApplicationModel.Appointments.AppointmentManager.ShowAddAppointmentAsync(                                       appointment, rect, Windows.UI.Popups.Placement.Default); </code></pre>  <p>My problem is that the appointment always is create in the default calendar, i need specify the calendar in which it must created, or change the default user calendar before of the appointment creation.</p>
