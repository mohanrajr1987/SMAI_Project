<p>I have this code:</p>  <pre><code>protected void Calendar1_VisibleMonthChanged(object sender, MonthChangedEventArgs e) {     DateTime date = Convert.ToDateTime(Calendar1.VisibleDate.ToString("M, y"));     Label2.Text = date.ToString("MM, yyyy") + "Ð³."; } </code></pre>  <p>And when i change month in Calendar, Label2.text allways consists of months of 2015(current) year, even if i change month in Calendar 13 times. For example, in Calendar i see 1st January 2016, but in label still 1st January 2015.</p>
