<p>I have a WatchKit Application that grabs the user's calendar events and displays them in a list. The app runs pretty fast when there aren't a lot of events (10~15 events), but when multiple events and multiple calendars are involved (30+ events), the scrolling becomes very laggy and the list keeps constantly refreshing.</p>  <p>Obviously the watch wasn't designed to handle a lot of data at once, so the only options I considered are having a "Loading..." label or animation to display while the data is being retrieved, or I could run the data retrieval in the background on the iOS app, and then send the data to the watch kit app when it's done, because the iOS app can retrieve the data a lot faster.</p>  <p>I'm leaning toward the second option, the only problem is how do I implement this. Should I use app groups?</p>
