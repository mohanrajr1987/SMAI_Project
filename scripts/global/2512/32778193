<p>I am currently trying to create an Android app, for my A-Level Computing Practical Project, which stores a users calendar/timetable within a MySQL database and can be accessed by logging into the app. I want to be able to make it so that you can access the calendar from any device as long as you are logged in so I was just wondering what the best way to do this would be as the ways in which I have thought of so far will end up using large amounts of space over time and I wish to prevent this.</p>  <p>Currently I am thinking about creating a table which stores all of the users calendars by their e-mail address, I will then have a field which contains an array of all of the events. I know that this is very inefficient and was wondering if anyone could give me any ideas into how I could do this I would be extremely grateful.</p>  <p>I am also willing to change the method of doing this as I am not stuck with using MySQL</p>
