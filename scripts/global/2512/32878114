<p>I have timestamp date format from hosting database, My problem now is how to convert this timestamp format to readable calendar date and put inside the calendar, the process of converting will be done inside the calendar javascript I think this is possible my problem is how can I do that? I can now translate the to calendar format by using this if I have given declaration of timestamp format.</p>  <p>var timestamp = 1441987200;           var date = new Date(timestamp * 1000);</p>  <pre><code>      datevalues = [          date.getFullYear(),          date.getMonth()+1,          date.getDate(),          date.getHours(),          date.getMinutes(),          date.getSeconds(),       ];        alert(datevalues); </code></pre>  <p>But I cant put it inside my calendar because of different format of my plugin calendar with this new Date(y, 9, 2).</p>  <p>$scope.events =[ {title: 'Long Event',start: new Date(y, 9, 2),end: new Date(y, 10, 7)}],</p>  <p>Can anyone help me to find the solution for this? Thanks and regards.</p>
