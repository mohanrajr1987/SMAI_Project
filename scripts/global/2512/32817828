<p>The size of CaldroidFragment is messed when it is embed in a ScrollView. The reason is Caldroid uses GridView to render the calendar, and as an known issue that GridView cannot correctly measure it's height correctly inside ScrollView and so far there is no better solution. And I tried some workarounds mentioned <a href="https://github.com/roomorama/Caldroid/issues/53" rel="nofollow">here</a>, but so far didn't find any of them workable. </p>
