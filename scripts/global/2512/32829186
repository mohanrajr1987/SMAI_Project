<p>I trying to figure out how to create a clock and lunisolar calendar that can extend back by at least 10,000 years calculated down to the millisecond.  I want to make it in html and excel.  But the problem is that I don't know how to change the rules of how time works e.i the length of the second, minute, hour, day, month, year, leap year, and year week. </p>
