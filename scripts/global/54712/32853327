<p>After spending over <strong>11 hours of research</strong> with no result at all its time to post here!</p>  <p>Id like to make a table with multiple columns and rows where an onclick will allow the user to edit the content and it will be sent back to my flask web-framework so I can UPDATE mySQL and store the new data.</p>  <p>The original content would be fed from mySQL as well.</p>  <p>I would be more than happy to post the code, but I've got nothing. I did study for hours the flask ajax jquery ridiculously tiny documentation on this but got me nowhere. Thank you very much in advance!</p>
