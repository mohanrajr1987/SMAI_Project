<p>i am so much curious to understand how ssl works so i have decided to use ssl on my local flask development environment. i have read this article <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/snippets/111/" rel="nofollow">flask.pocoo.org...ts</a> but i can not understand where i will get the <code>yourserver.key</code> and <code>yourserver.crt</code> files?</p>  <p>please give me some idea about having those files for free! i have seen many company sell ssl but i want a free one for my local development just in my computer only.</p>  <p>I am on windows 7 </p>
