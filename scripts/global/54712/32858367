<p>I'm using Jinja2 to server translated static text in html templates. So far I've only served static text (with <code>{% trans %}My text{% endtrans %}</code>), but I'd like to also add some data into the text that is stored in client-side JavaScript variables. I know Jinja is designed for server-side rendering (including data), but perhaps someone knows a way to add parameters on the client-side.</p>
