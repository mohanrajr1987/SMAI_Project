<p>I thought that I would be able to require login for all derived views by decorating <code>__enter__</code> as follows:</p>  <pre><code>from flask.views import MethodView from flask.ext.login import login_required class LoggedInView(MethodView):     @login_required     def __enter__(self):         pass </code></pre>  <p>If I add some logging, it turns out <code>__enter__</code> is not entered. Similarly, <code>__exit__</code> doesn't happen.</p>  <p>What's going on here?</p>  <p>I can modify the style to decorate some other function, but then it's necessary to call <code>super()</code> in derived views which defeats the point of doing this to begin with.</p>  <p>How can I enforce this decoration without any work in views beyond inheriting <code>LoggedInView</code>?</p>
