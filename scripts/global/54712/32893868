<p>I am trying to export a ModelView's data to CSV. Activating <code>can_export = True</code> as recommended in the docs does nothing. I inspected my Flask-Admin installation, and even though it was the latest version (1.3.0), the source is different, so I downloaded and installed the <code>master.zip</code> available on GitHub.</p>  <p>Now, the Export button appears on my View, but clicking it generates <code>BuildError: ('tableview.export_csv', {}, None)</code></p>  <p>I tried manually pasting the source's <code>export_csv</code> method into my class (which seems kludgy), but all I get is an empty CSV file.</p>  <p>How can I let the user download a CSV with the table view data?</p>  <p>My code for reference:</p>  <pre><code>class DataTable(Secure):     def __init__(self, modelclass, session, **kwargs):         super(DataTable, self).__init__(modelclass, session, **kwargs)         self.can_export = True         self.column_filters = [c[0] for c in self._list_columns] # Add view to menu admin.add_view(DataTable(modelclass, name='TESTE', category=u'TEST')) </code></pre>
