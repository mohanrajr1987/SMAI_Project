<p>This is my Flask app structure:</p>  <pre><code>app/     app.py     static/         static files     secure/         secret_file.ext </code></pre>  <p>Is there any possible way of a hacker accessing <code>secret_file.ext</code> or even <code>app.py</code> itself, perhaps through a php script of some sort? If so, how can this be prevented?</p>  <p>Also, what are some other security considerations to keep in mind when deploying a Flask app to the web?</p>
