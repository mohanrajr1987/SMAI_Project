<p>As stated in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32874629/flask-not-finding-routes-in-imported-modules?noredirect=1#comment53582406_32874629">Flask not finding routes in imported modules</a> I have a very simple Flask application in Python 2.7 that wasn't working when my routes were defined in a different module. </p>  <p>To recap, I have <code>run.py</code> at the top-level, which declares the Flask <code>app</code> variable and then imports the <code>views.home</code> module where the views are defined.</p>  <p>I have discovered that if I switch the import statement in <code>run.py</code> from:</p>  <pre><code>import views.home </code></pre>  <p>to</p>  <pre><code>from views.home import * </code></pre>  <p>everything works.</p>  <p>Why is that? As far as I can tell (<a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/187403/import-module-vs-from-module-import-function">http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/187403/import-module-vs-from-module-import-function</a>) there isn't any functional different between the two imports that should impact the behaviour of Flask?</p>
