<p>Is there a way for flask to accept a full URL as a parameter?</p>  <p>I am aware that  accept path with slashes.  However I require to accept everything including "?" of the presented URL.  For instance</p>  <p><a href="http://someapi/someurl.com?andother?yetanother" rel="nofollow">http://someapi/someurl.com?andother?yetanother</a></p>  <p>I want the "someurl.com?andother?yetanother" as a full argument to accept.  I can't split it into multiple ones, since I do not know ahead of time what will be given.  </p>
