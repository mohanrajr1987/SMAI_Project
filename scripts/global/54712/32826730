<p>I'd like to use the HTML5 pattern field on the TelField <a href="http://www.wufoo.com/html5/attributes/10-pattern.html" rel="nofollow">(e.g)</a>, is it possible?</p>  <p>otherwise I will have to use the backend validator RegExp, good but not ideal given what the html5 provides us with(my humble opinion at least)</p>  <p>Checking the code I can't see any keyword param available, and passing "_pattern" (as "pattern" only doesn't work) doesn't make the trick as well</p>  <pre><code>phone = TelField(     'Phone number', [validators.Required()], pattern='^(\+)*',     description={'tooltips': 'Don\'t forget Country code eg. (+44)'} ) </code></pre>  <p>anyone tried that before? Is it better using the validators instead the "html field"?</p>
