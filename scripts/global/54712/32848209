<p>I'm having an issue with <strong>Flask-Login</strong> where for some reason it seems to clear the data from my session. This issue only seem to happen to me when I run my application on <strong>AWS</strong> within a Docker container. There doesn't seem to be any issues when this is run locally within a Docker container. The container kick starts the application using <strong>supervisord</strong> to launch the <strong>nginx</strong> and <strong>gunicorn</strong> servers.</p>  <p>I'm using Flask-Login and SQLAlchemy to handle my user logins. I'm creating a custom token using the <code>get_auth_token()</code> method in my User model which stores the token with some session data in my database. I use the <code>token_loader</code> and <code>user_loader</code> callbacks to retrieve my User data from the database which works fine.</p>  <p>However, if I'm not actively using my application for a few minutes the session data seems to disappear when I change to a page that requires a login. My session cookie remains unchanged and my <code>token_loader</code> or <code>user_loader</code> callbacks never seem to be called. To work out what might be happening with the session I attached a <code>@app.before_request</code> handler to print the session contents:</p>  <pre><code>[2015-09-29 14:47:21,348] DEBUG in __init__: &lt;SecureCookieSession {u'csrf_token': '51b5b253c55ac954c1bc61dd2dca513e18c4d790', u'_fresh': True, u'user_id': 3, u'_id': 'd3adbd2ed3905986d515aeb04cd1ff7d'}&gt; [2015-09-29 14:47:21,382] DEBUG in __init__: &lt;SecureCookieSession {u'_flashes': [('message', u'Please log in to access this page.')]}&gt; </code></pre>  <p>It appeared that all of the user information was there for me to be able to load my user but it has bailed out and re-directed to the login page with the Flask-Login flash error. This re-directs before it even touches my callbacks to load the user from the database.</p>  <p>Is this possibly just a set up issue with my server configs that is causing an issue with domains? I'm not really sure what I need to look at and try to debug this further.</p>
