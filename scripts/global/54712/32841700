<p>I have a SQLAlchemy model in Flask holding series of timestamps and values. I'd like to draw a chart using Flot charts from these data but can't find any information on how to do this. </p>  <pre><code>class Reading(database.Model):     __tablename__= 'Readings'     index = database.Column('id', database.Integer, primary_key = True)     timestamp = database.Column('Timestamp', database.DateTime)     value = database.Column('Value', database.Float) </code></pre>  <p>I know how to get the data in Flask app and how to use Flot charts in html but have no idea how to connect these two.</p>
