<p>I have an ArrayList of String named "info" and each string holds the information about an instance of my class Student. I try converting the Arraylist into an array and then parsing it using split method.</p>  <pre><code>String[] Stringinfo = new String[info.size()]; Stringinfo = info.toArray(Stringinfo); </code></pre>  <p>after I parse each line I try to make a new object in my for loop and adding it to the Students ArrayList. What happens is that every time I create this new object Student, the other objects which were added to Students ArrayList before, are all changed to this new object.</p>  <pre><code>String[] temp;         for(int i = 1; i &lt; LineCount + 1 ; i++)         {             temp = Stringinfo[i].split(" ");             Student s = new Student(Integer.parseInt(temp[0]), Integer.parseInt(temp[1]), Integer.parseInt(temp[2]), Integer.parseInt(temp[3]), Integer.parseInt(temp[4]));             Students.add(s);         } </code></pre>  <p>I tried printing Students in different points and everthing is alright until the new object is created.  At any time all the objects have the same attribute values as the last object created.</p>  <p>this is the Student class constructor:</p>  <pre><code>public Student(int certif, int class_id, int ave, int i, int a) {     certification_num = certif;     class_id = class;     average_point = ave;     student_id = i;     age = a; } </code></pre>  <p>I searched a lot but couldn't find an answer. Sorry if the answer is obvious I am new to Java. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.</p>  <p>Edit:</p>  <pre><code>public class Student{      public Student(){}      public Student(int certif, int class, int ave, int i, int a)     {         certification_num = certif;         class_id = class;         average_point = ave;         student_id = i;         age = a;     }       public static int get_certification_num(){         return certification_num;     }      public static int get_class_id(){         return class_id;     }      public static int get_average_point(){         return average_point;     }      public static int get_id(){         return student_id;     }      public static int get_age(){         return age;     }      private static int certification_num;     private static int class_id;     private static int age;     private static int node_id;     private static int student_id; } </code></pre>
