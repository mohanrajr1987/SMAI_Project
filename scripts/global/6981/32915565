<p>I have an MVC grid control that is passing back the collection to my controller as an object. The object is an array of the rows from the grid and each row represents an instance of a class called lineitem that is part of a parent record class.</p>  <p>I am trying to load the object into the class by looping through the object array, create an instance of my lineitem class, and then add it to my parent record class parent.AddItem(lineitem)</p>  <p>I am guessing I need some kind of conversion, since the controller doesn't know what the object looks like until it gets passed over, but I do not know how to convert an object in something useful like a list, array, string[] etc.</p>  <p>The problem is how do you loop through an object?  Everything I have tried is not working.</p>  <pre><code>var items = requestData.ExtraRequestData["Items"];  Model.Parent parent = new Model.Parent(); Model.LineItem lineitem = new Model.LineItem(); </code></pre>  <p>items is my class array being passed from view as an object.</p>  <pre><code>for (int I = 0; I &lt; items.length; I++){         lineitem.a = item.a,        lineitem.b = item.b parent.AddItem(lineitem) } </code></pre>  <p>This is how I would normally access things. I get error, object does not contain a definition for length.  So basically, how do I convert an object into something useful, I can loop through and load my class?</p>
