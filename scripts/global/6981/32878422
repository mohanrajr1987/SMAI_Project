<p>I have tried EVERY solution I can find, and nothing is working.</p>  <p>I have an array of objects, which in the HTML is a dropdown menu. I can not get it to sort. Here is my code:</p>  <pre><code>$scope.materials = []  var Material = function(materialName) {      this.name = materialName;      $scope.materials.push(this);    }  _.sortBy($scope.materials, function(object){     return object.name;      }); </code></pre>  <p>//==========below are some of my objects that I am pushing into the array(I'm planning to add more properties to them later besides just a 'name'================//</p>  <pre><code>var pipeCleaners = new Material ('pipe cleaners') var glitter = new Material ('glitter') var pomPoms = new Material (' pom poms') var feathers = new Material ('feathers') var cottonBalls = new Material ('cotton balls') </code></pre>
