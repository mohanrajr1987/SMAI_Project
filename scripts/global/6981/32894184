<p>Let's imagine that I have a text file that contains 1000 lines. All of them look like this: </p>  <pre><code>FirstName:SecondName:1:2:3:4 </code></pre>  <p>":" can be replaced with any other symbol, and i have list of 1000 objects:</p>  <pre><code>class RECORD:     FNAME = "default"     SNAME = "default"     M1 = 0;     M2 = 0;     M3 = 0;     M4 = 0;      def outname(self):         print (self.FNAME + self.SNAME)  LIST = [] for i in range(1000):     LIST.append(RECORD(i)) </code></pre>  <p>So, I want to read this file, and fill first objects with strings and integers from first line, second object with second line etc.  How can I do that? </p>
