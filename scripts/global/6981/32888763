<p>I know this may be a duplicate, but I have found a lot of questions that were similar to mine, but their answer did not answer mine. For example this page <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperty" rel="nofollow">https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperty</a> did not contain the answer to my question, as far as I know.</p>  <p>This is what I have: <div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false"> <div class="snippet-code"> <pre class="snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>var User = function() {   this.name = ''; }  User.prototype.password = ''; // or Object.defineProperty(User.prototype, 'password', {enumerable: true, configurable: true, writable: true});  console.log(new User()); // User {name: ""}</code></pre> </div> </div> </p>  <p>This of course adds password to the prototype of the object, but I'd like to add the password as a member after the constructor has been defined. Is there a way to achieve this? <div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false"> <div class="snippet-code"> <pre class="snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>var User = function() {   this.name = ''; }  User.prototype.password = '';  console.log(new User()); // User {name: "", password: ""}</code></pre> </div> </div> </p>
