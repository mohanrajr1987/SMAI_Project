<p>I'm loving RethinkDB!</p>  <p>I have a quick question in regards to efficiency of fetching data. I'm building a CRUD model for managing people's contacts.</p>  <p>Making one document containing an array of all the userID's contacts and access it by the primary index (the userID)</p>  <p>OR</p>  <p>Making one document for each contact of the userID and access it by a secondary index (the userID)</p>  <p>I'm trying to imagine how this would play out when there's 10,000 users and about 100,000 unique contacts.</p>  <p>Thank you!!!</p>
