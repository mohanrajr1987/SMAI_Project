<p>Say I have an Object <code>Parent</code> containing <code>Name</code> as one of the keys. I gotta do a task only after checking if the value say <code>Tom</code> is available under the key <code>Name</code>. This is kind of checking for username and password but Parse handles it with inbuilt code.</p>  <p>How do I check for the availability of value for a key in an object in Parse Android? </p>  <p>Any help is appreciated!   </p>
