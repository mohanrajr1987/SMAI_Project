<p>I have the following code:</p>  <pre><code>var optionsChart = {     data: [{         type: "bla",         dataPoints: [{             x: 1,             y: 3         }, {             x: 1,             y: 2         }, {             x: 3,             y: 4         }]     },     etc... } </code></pre>  <p>Now I tried to generate the Datas in the <strong>dataPoints</strong> field dynamically. I have an Array like this:</p>  <pre><code>dataArray = [[1,3], [1,2],[3,4]]; </code></pre>  <p>I try to insert his after <strong>dataPoints</strong>, but when doing this it needs to be exactly like in the code above, but I don't know how to do that.</p>  <p>Any suggestions here? Thank you very much!</p>
