<p>I am creating multiple HTML elements. Elements have different properties. </p>  <p>I would like to get the property name, and the its value using index.</p>  <pre><code>var elements = [             {"type":"div","className":"items","id":"item-0-"+item}             {"type":"div","className":"items","id":"item-0-"+item}             {"type":"input","type":"number","step":1,"min":1}         ]; </code></pre>  <p>I want to access it like,</p>  <pre><code>        alert(elements[0][1]); //"className":"items"         alert(elements[0][1].value); //items </code></pre>  <p>I tried that but It is not working.</p>
