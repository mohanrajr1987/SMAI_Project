<p>I'm coming from AS3 to HTML5 javascript so this is kinda confusing:</p>  <p>1.</p>  <p>I noticed that inside objects, you do not need to declare vars:</p>  <pre><code>var player = {  type:'player', x:50, } </code></pre>  <p>The same thing with vars (var type, var x) display errors, why is that?</p>  <p>2 . Why don't I need to declare a var in a function:</p>  <pre><code>createPlayer = function(){ a = 5; console.log(a); //works } </code></pre>  <p>3.  I assume that inside a function, once you create a new var like this:</p>  <pre><code> var a; //global var  createPlayer = function(){  a = 3;  } </code></pre>  <p>it first searches to see if there's a global var called a, if it already exists it changes it's value, if not it creates it locally in the function. is that correct?</p>  <ol start="4"> <li>Generally, when do I need to declare a var, and when not?</li> </ol>  <p>Thank you for your time.</p>
