<p>Supposing I have an <code>Array</code> with <code>x</code> elements. I would like to loop through this <code>Array</code> in "tens" and add a <code>run-Time</code> variable. This means that each set of 10 <code>Arrays</code> will have a unique <code>run-time</code>. I am using the code below:</p>  <pre><code>$time = '00:00:00';  $k = 0;     for ($i = 0; $i &lt; count($agnt_arr); $i+=10) {         $temp = strtotime("+$k minutes", strtotime($time));         $runTime = date('H:i', $temp);         array_push($agnt_arr[$i], $runTime);         $k+=4;     } </code></pre>  <p>Where <code>$agnt_arr</code> is an <code>Array</code> with the following structure :</p>  <pre><code>Array (     [0] =&gt; Array         (             [name] =&gt; User.One              [email] =&gt; User.One@mail.com         )      [1] =&gt; Array         (             [name] =&gt; User.Two              [email] =&gt; User.Two@mail.com         )      [2] =&gt; Array         (             [name] =&gt; User.Three              [email] =&gt; User.Three@mail.com         ) ) </code></pre>  <p>The problem I'm having is the run times are only added to the 10th element which is expected But I would like elements 0-9 to have the same run time and 10-20 etc. How would I achieve something like this??</p>
