<p>In Javascript I have a function that should find the elements on the page that have the "connected" class, and when a button is clicked the classes for these elements are cleared. I have written this code:</p>  <pre><code>var prev_connected = document.getElementsByClassName("connected"); if (prev_connected.length &gt; 0) {     for (var j = 0; j &lt; prev_connected.length; j++) {         prev_connected[j].removeAttribute("class");     } } </code></pre>  <p>However, it only ever deletes the class attribute of the first "connected" element on the page. When I have two "connected" elements, I have confirmed that the "prev_connected" array does hold 2 values, but for some reason the for loop never reaches the 2nd one. Is there something I'm doing wrong? Thanks.</p>
