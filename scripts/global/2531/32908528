<p>I am at basic level of understanding Java right now so I haven't wrote everything here but I have changed some parts of the code. I might use the wrong words but I try my best.</p>  <p>The <strong>main</strong> method down below is creating an enviroment <strong>(escaper.createEnviroment(a))</strong> for a robot who's assignment is to find the exit of a room that is 4X4 squares big <strong>(escaper.moveToEntrance())</strong>. I also put in a counter <strong>k</strong> to count how many time it has sucess with the <strong>moveToEntrance</strong> method. </p>  <p>The for loops inside <strong>main</strong> and <strong>createEnviroment</strong> are for testing the robot with a start position of (2+a,2+b) or every position from (2,2) to (5,5) (16positions). Later I also want it to change the direction with the <strong>robot.//direction//</strong> parameter in robot. So I want it to test a total of 64 "positions".</p>  <p>Right now the loop with variable (a) is working properly but (b) is looping but not running (?? = <strong>moveToEntrance</strong> ??). I get a total of 16 windows, but only 4 are moving. Those are the robots starting on (2+a,2). </p>  <p><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/126736473/lab2.zip" rel="nofollow">zipped source code</a> if anyone feel like helping :)</p>  <pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) {     int k=0;     for(int a=0;a&lt;4;a++){         Escaper escaper = new Escaper();         escaper.createEnviroment(a);         escaper.moveToEntrance();         k++;     }     System.out.println(k); }//main   public void createEnviroment(int a){         for (int b = 0;b&lt;4;b++){             RobotWorld world = RobotWorld.load("src/room.txt");             robot = new Robot(2 + a, 2 + b, Robot.EAST, world);             robot.setDelay(50);     } }//createEnviroment  </code></pre>
