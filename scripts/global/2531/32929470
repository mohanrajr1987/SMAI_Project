<p>Do the D A N C E 1 2 3 4 5 Stick to the B E A T Get ready to ignite</p>  <p>So I am trying to write a for loop that alerts each item above in that order without having to write alert() for each of them. I don't know exactly how to approach this but this is what I have for now:</p>  <pre><code>var dance = ["Do the", "D", "A", "N", "C" "E", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "Stick to the ", "B", "E", "A", "T", "Get ready to ignite"]; for (var i= 0, i &lt; dance.length; i += 1) {     alert(dance[i]);  } </code></pre>  <p>But I'm pretty sure my code is wrong. Is there anything I didn't add to my code? What exactly is wrong?</p>
