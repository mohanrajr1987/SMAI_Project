<p>I've been trying a while now but i just can't seem to get it right. I'm a starting programmer and have to do an assignment for school. The program should ask the user for a number and print a diamond shape, based on this number. Now I've got it working fine.. but I have print statements outside my main. How do i get this inside my main?</p>  <p>my code:</p>  <pre><code>def loop(start, eind, step, ei):     for a in range (start, eind, step):                for b in range(a):                               print(" ", end="")                         for c in range(ei+1, a, -1):             print(a, end="")                     for d in range(a, ei):                        print(a, end="")                  print("")    def main():     print("Welcome!  :) ")     loop(y,0,-1,y)     loop(2,y+1,1,y) </code></pre>  <p>Hope you guys can help me out! By the way, I've got more code for this program but that's not relevant (like asking the user for "y").</p>
