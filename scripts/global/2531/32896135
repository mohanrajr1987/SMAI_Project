<p>I want to go through a list of files and check if each filename match any of the string in a list. This is what I have so far, but it is not finding any match. What am I doing wrong?</p>  <pre><code>$files = $("MyApp.Tests.dll","MyApp.Tests.pdb","MyApp.dll") $excludeTypes = $("*.Tests.dll","*.Tests.pdb")  foreach ($file in $files)  {     $containsString = foreach ($type in $ExcludeTypes) { $file | %($_ -match '$type') }      if($containsString -contains $true)     {         Write-Host "$file contains string."     }     else     {         Write-Host "$file does NOT contains string."     } } </code></pre>
