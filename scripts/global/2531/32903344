<p>I am trying to create a batch file which scans a folder for files</p>  <pre><code>for /R D:\path\import_orders\xml_files\ %%f in (*.xml) do(     copy %%f "\\destination"     if errorlevel 0 move %%f "D:\path\import_orders\xml_files\archive\" ) </code></pre>  <p><strong>FIXED</strong> - <em>But it won't work. If I execute it, it only prints the first line of code</em>. <strong>It works now. I added a space after the "do (" and now it executes.</strong></p>  <p>1) is my second command ok? I want to move the copied file in an archive if everything went well with the first command.</p>  <p>2) how should i change the loop to work only on the files in the given directory and not the subdirectories in it?</p>
