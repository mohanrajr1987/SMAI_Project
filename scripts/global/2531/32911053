<p>I have a function which is quite intensive in my algorithm.</p>  <p>I want to try to make it as efficient as possible. I don't care too much for readability or anything like that. Just speed.</p>  <p>The basis of the function is to take a set of cards:</p>  <pre><code>$card1, $card2, $card3, $card4, $card5, $card6, $card7 </code></pre>  <p>Where each card is a numeric value. </p>  <p>I then have an array of values that need to be removed from the above set.</p>  <p>$remove_values = array(1,4,3,8,12);</p>  <p>So basically, what I need to do is, if $card1 to $card7 appear in the Remove Values, set that card to 0. </p>  <p>My current function:</p>  <pre><code>foreach($remove_values as $value) {     if($value === $card1) {         $card1 = 0;     }     if($value === $card2) {         $card2 = 0;     }     if($value === $card3) {         $card3 = 0;     }     if($value === $card4) {         $card4 = 0;     }     if($value === $card5) {         $card5 = 0;     }     if($value === $card6) {         $card6 = 0;     }     if($value === $card7) {         $card7 = 0;     } } </code></pre>  <p>This works. But I was wondering if there was a more faster way of doing it? Calling php functions is intensive, so I'm trying to reduce the amount of those calls.</p>  <p>I'm literally trying to shave off miliseconds due to my algorithm having to loop through millions of results. </p>
