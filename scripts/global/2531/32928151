<p>I am new to programming and I was having some difficulty understanding the logic behind a Python 'for' loop implementation example I came across:</p>  <pre><code>s="abcdefg" t="" for a in s:    t=a+t </code></pre>  <p>I am confused as to why this piece of code returns "gfedcba." Why should it be any different from:</p>  <pre><code>s="abcdefg" t="" for a in s:    t=t+a </code></pre>  <p>... which returns "abcdefg." </p>
