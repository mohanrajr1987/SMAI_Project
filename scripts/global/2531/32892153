<p>I'm creating a game using <code>Swift 2.0</code> and <code>Sprite-Kit</code> with <code>Xcode7</code>. I want to implement 4 purple balls that are suppose to resemble lives. So every time the player gets hit he loses one purple ball. They are supposed to appear side by side. I was wondering if instead of hardcoding 4 balls on to the scene I could instead use a <code>for loop</code> to display 4 balls.</p>  <pre><code>let purpleBall = SKSpriteNode(texture: purpleTexture) purpleBall.position = CGPointMake(self.frame.size.width * 0.65, self.frame.size.height * 0.92) self.addChild(purpleBall) </code></pre>  <p>I haven't been successful on getting 4 balls to appear on the scene. This was one of my attempts.</p>  <pre><code>for(var i = 0.50; i &lt;= 0.90; i = i + 0.10) {         let purpleBall = SKSpriteNode(texture: purpleTexture)         purpleBall.position = CGPointMake(self.frame.size.width * i, self.frame.size.height * 0.92)         self.addChild(purpleBall) } </code></pre>  <p>Here I get an error: Binary operator cannot be applied to operands of type 'CGFloat' and 'Double' Do I have to convert <code>i</code> to CGFloat? and will this code actually place 4 different balls side by side or only move the single one to each new position.</p>
