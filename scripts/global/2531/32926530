<p>This is my first post on SO, so i thank you for your help.  I am using a for loop to calculate pay at 1 penny for the first day and then it doubles every day until it reaches the number of days that the user specified from a <code>JOptionDialog</code> box.  The tricky part is that I need to display the fianl results as:  </p>  <pre><code>Day          Earnings               Total 1             1                       1 2             2                       3 3             4                       7 4             8                       15 </code></pre>  <p>and so on, all in on JOptionPane message box at the end.  Everything in my code works right except for that.  It works right in a console, or I can get it to display in a Message box one line per one box at a time.  I can't see any way to get everything in one Message box.  I tried using a file to store code, but my Prof said that was 'too complicated."  So, whatever the easier way is, I'm missing it.  Here is my code:  </p>  <pre><code>import javax.swing.JOptionPane;                //Imports API JOptionPane class import java.text.DecimalFormat;               //Imports java text formattingclass DecimalFormat  public class PenniesForPay                   //This line creates the class PenniesForPay { public static void main(String[] args)   {   String inputString;                           //For reading input   int daysWorked;                               //To hold the number of days worked   int dayNumber = 1;                          //Holds which day in the work sequence and acts as the for loop counter variable                                                 double dailyPennies = .01;                               //To hold daily earnings, initialized at 1   double totalPennies = .01;                               //Initializing an accumulator     //User enters a value for total days worked   inputString =          JOptionPane.showInputDialog("Please enter your number of days worked as a value greater than 0 ");    //Entered value is converted to an int    daysWorked = Integer.parseInt(inputString);    //Check that inputString value is &gt;= 1   while (daysWorked &lt; 1)   {      inputString =          JOptionPane.showInputDialog("Please re-enter your number of days worked as a value greater than 0 ");      daysWorked = Integer.parseInt(inputString);   }    //Creating at least one line of output      System.out.println("Day\t\t\tDaily Keep\t\tAccrued Total\n" + "_______________________________________________________________\n" +    dayNumber + "\t\t\t$" + dailyPennies + "\t\t\t$" + totalPennies);    //For loop for generating values for remaining days worked and the total pay    for (dayNumber = 2; dayNumber &lt;= daysWorked; dayNumber++)   {         dailyPennies *= 2;       totalPennies += dailyPennies;       if (totalPennies &lt; 100)                                           /**If else loop to separate accruals &lt; 100 totalPennies;                                                                         to assign formatter correctly*/      {         System.out.print(dayNumber + "\t\t\t$" + dailyPennies + "\t\t\t$");         System.out.printf("%.2f\n", totalPennies);                     //A printf method to deal with long decimals                        }       else      {          DecimalFormat formatter = new DecimalFormat("#,##0.00");       //A DecimalFormat class call to deal with long decimals and add commas         if (dailyPennies &lt; 100)                                        /**If else loop to separate accruals &lt; 100 dailyPennies;                                                                         to assign formatter correctly*/         {            System.out.println(dayNumber + "\t\t\t$" + dailyPennies + "\t\t\t$" + formatter.format(totalPennies));         }         else         {            System.out.println(dayNumber + "\t\t\t$" + formatter.format(dailyPennies) + "\t\t\t$" +             formatter.format(totalPennies));           }      }   }    System.exit(0);                                                      } } </code></pre>  <p>Thank you, Andrew</p>
