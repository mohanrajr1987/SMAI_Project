<p>i have been asked this question in an interview question that is that possible that you can access and array forward and reverse in a single for loop like for example he asked me you have an array of your name</p>  <pre><code>  $array = ('s','a','f','i','r');      </code></pre>  <p>how would you do that ?    </p>  <p>as people are asking about the output , the output should be</p>  <blockquote>   <p><strong>array forward = safir</strong></p>      <p><strong>array backward = rifas</strong></p> </blockquote>
