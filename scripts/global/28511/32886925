<p>All of a sudden, I am getting a full blown crash whenever I run/play my project with the native VR support in <code>Unity 5.2.0f3</code> and <code>Oculus version 1.7 (SDK 0.6.0.1)</code> which has never happened before, until today out of the blue. No change made to anything to do with VR or Oculus that might have triggered it, hence my confusion...</p>  <p>This is what I get on the log:</p>  <pre><code>Unity Editor [version: Unity 5.2.0f3_e7947df39b5c]  OVRPlugin.dll caused an Access Violation (0xc0000005)   in module OVRPlugin.dll at 0033:eb9a3b9a. </code></pre>  <p>My PC and GC: - Windows 7 - Nvidia GTX980 Ti</p>  <p>Thanks in advance for your help,</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/zBLdi.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/zBLdi.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/RTA56.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/RTA56.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
