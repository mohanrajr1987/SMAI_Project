<p>How can I detect if a gameObject has collided with two other specific objects <strong>at the same time?</strong></p>  <p>This is what I intend to do but it does not work:</p>  <pre><code>void OnCollisionEnter (Collision col) {  if(col.gameObject.name == "object1" &amp;&amp; "object2")     {         Destroy(gameObject);     } } </code></pre>  <p>How can I correct this piece of code?</p>
