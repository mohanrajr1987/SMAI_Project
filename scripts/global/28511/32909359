<p>in my Unity (5.1.3) Application i am using a lot of sprites and i want also to use the DOF Script. The problem is, that Depth Of Field does not "see" all my sprites, because the Sprite shader does not write to Z Buffer.</p>  <p>I looked on the internet and found some posts, they all say the same - change the sprite Shader:</p>  <p>replace <code>"RenderType"="Transparent"</code> with <code>"RenderType"="TransparentCutout"</code> and <code>ZWrite Off</code> with <code>ZWrite On</code></p>  <p>i tried that and a lot of other stuff (Geometry Queue, Opaque RenderType, etc..) and nothing of that helps me. The Depth of Field Image Effect still can't see my sprites in the scene.</p>  <p>Can someone help me or give me a hint? I really would appreciate help on this problem!</p>  <p>Thanks &amp; Regards</p>
