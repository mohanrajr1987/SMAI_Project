<p>I'm working with Unity 5 and the Smart Merge tool: a tool that helps you to merge files that would otherwise be hard to merge. For this tool to work, you have to change a setting in Unity that will ensure that those files are serialised as text, rather than being binary. This is fine, and I've turned that on in the two branches that I want to merge and now all those assets are serialised as text.</p>  <p>However, when I go to merge, I get errors when the Smart Merge tool tries to look at the 'base' versions of those files. These versions of the files are from the common ancestor of the branches I'm trying to merge. Of course, since I only turned on the text serialisation recently for merging, the files from the common ancestor are binary and the merge tool can't handle them.</p>  <p>Is there any way I can work around this? I thought maybe this would be possible through git, so I posted here instead of on the gamedev StackExchange site. </p>
