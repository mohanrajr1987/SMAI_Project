<p>I'm using <code>Unity</code> and i am doing a pong game. I would like to be able to move the paddles with the mouse key. I have tried just moving their position but that of course will simply "teleport" them through the colliders along the edge of the playing field. I tried using <code>addForce()</code> and making the rigidbody fixed in the x position, however, what happens is when the ball hits the paddle, it pushes it and the paddle snaps back. All of the ball's energy is lost (there is gravity in my game). How can i move this box collider but not let it over lap other box colliders while moving? Thanks!!!</p>
