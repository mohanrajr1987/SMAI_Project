<p>I'm working on a VR project on Oculus with Unity, and I want to make the time in-game go slow. Now I use the code below:</p>  <pre><code>Time.timeScale = 0.1f;  Time.fixedDeltaTime = 0.02F * Time.timeScale; </code></pre>  <p>Fortunately, it goes quite well, but when I play it, the picture becomes wierd. You can see everything in the scene twice or a third time. I checked on the internet and it says this codes makes the whole game process slow, including rendering.</p>  <p>So does anybody know how to make the effect which looks like bullet time and meanwhile doesn't make the background process slow?</p>
