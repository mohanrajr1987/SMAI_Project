<p>I have been trying to make a movement script for my player in a 2D game but without success. I do not know why it is not working.</p>  <p>The problem is that the player isn't moving. I have a <code>RigidBody</code> attached and gravity on. (Not sure if gravity makes such a difference but I just thought to mention it.)</p>  <pre><code>using UnityEngine; using System.Collections;  public class PlayerMovement : MonoBehaviour {    public Rigidbody rb;    public float speed = 10; // Use this for initialization void Start () {  }  // Update is called once per frame void FixedUpdate () {     float mx = Input.GetAxisRaw("Horizontal");     float mz = Input.GetAxisRaw("Vertical");      Vector3 movement = new Vector3(mx, 0.0f, mz);     Debug.Log(movement);     rb.AddForce(movement * speed * Time.deltaTime);    } } </code></pre>
