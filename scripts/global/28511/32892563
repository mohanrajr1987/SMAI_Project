<p>I have a Unity native plugin with next structure:</p>  <ul> <li><code>Plugins/Android/Foo.jar</code> // Native Android library</li> <li><code>Plugins/Android/Foo.Android.dll</code> // Managed Unity wrapper to let access native Android routine (Marked as for Android only)</li> <li><code>Plugins/iOS/libFoo.a</code> // Native iOS library</li> <li><code>Plugins/iOS/Foo.iOS.dll</code> // Managed Unity wrapper to let access native iOS routine (Marked as for iOS only)</li> </ul>  <p>When I select Android or iOS platform and open my Unity project in MonoDevelop it not add reference for Foo.Android.dll. The same situation for iOS. Also <code>Unity Editor Console</code> contains error about not referenced classes used in my Unity code outside Plugin.</p>  <p><code>Assets/MainScript.cs(3,11): error CS0234: The type or namespace name</code>Bar' does not exist in the namespace <code>Foo'. Are you missing an assembly reference?</code></p>  <p>When change <code>Foo.iOS.dll</code>/<code>Foo.Android.dll</code> platform setting to <code>Any Platform</code> before opening MonoDevelop under iOS/Android respectively it's works as expected.</p>  <p>When I build project it's built successfully both for iOS and Android. </p>  <p>Where I need place my managed libraries or which settings I should use to force Unity add appropriate libraries as reference in opening MonoDevelop project?</p>  <p>Unity Editor 5.2.0f3, OS X Yosemite 10.10.5 (14F27)</p>
