<p>I'm making a fps in Unity3D. I would like to know how to import a folder of assets with JS or maybe, but not preferably, with C#.</p>  <p>The desired script will reference a directory and tell the code to import all the assets in the folder into the project assets while the game is running, and then not exist in the project assets folder any more, but still in their original folder. (Sorry if that makes no sense)</p>  <p>This script will be used to import DLC into the game.</p>
