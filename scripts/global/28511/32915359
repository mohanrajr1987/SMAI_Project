<p>I love the effects you can create with trapcode particular in After Effects. </p>  <p>I'm especially interested in the ability trapcode has to set 'audio to key frames' so that the particles react to music. Allowing you to make stuff like this: <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=votk1R8PtOA" rel="nofollow">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=votk1R8PtOA</a></p>  <p>I've just started out learning unity and I'm wanting to make a music game, firstly, is there anyway I can make the graphics in after effects using trapcode particular and then import them into unity to form the background scene?  Or is there anything similar to trapcode particular in unity?</p>  <p>Finally if the above questions are both no then, does anyone have any suggestions for how I can produce particular system based graphics that reacts to music?</p>
