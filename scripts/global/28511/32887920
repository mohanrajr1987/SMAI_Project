<p>I have an image on the scene. Now when I touch on my mobile device to a specific position, I want, that the image moves to this position.</p>  <p>How can I do it?</p>  <p>I wrote this:</p>  <pre><code>transform.position = Input.mousePosition; </code></pre>  <p>But this don't work. Ok, it's working, but the image is not anymore on the screen. It's somewhere on the right side.</p>  <p>I found this. But it's also not working:</p>  <pre><code>gameObject.GetComponent&lt;RectTransform&gt;().localPosition = new Vector2(Input.mousePosition.x, Input.mousePosition.y); </code></pre>  <p>Here is the problem, that when I touch on the screen bottom left (mobile) the object is in the center of the screen.</p>
