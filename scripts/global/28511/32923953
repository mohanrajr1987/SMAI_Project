<p>I have an object which when it is destroyed it will leave something behind. </p>  <pre><code>//Spawn object at point GameObject bonusDrop = (GameObject)Instantiate(bonusItem,target.transform.position, Quaternion.identity);  //Set the transform to the canvas (without this line the position is correct) bonusDrop.transform.SetParent(canvas.transform);  //object is completely off </code></pre>  <ul> <li>I would like to set it to the canvas as it is intended as a UI element</li> <li>The object ends up in the correct position if i dont set the parent (but if I don't set the parent the UI element won't work as intended).</li> <li>I would love some help in trying to figure this out. I hate to say it but I feel the solution is simple and I can't get it =(</li> </ul>
