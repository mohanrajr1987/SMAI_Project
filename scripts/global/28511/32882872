<p>I am writing a managed Unity3d plugin which handles some web requests, registration and downloading content from the web. I am using the .Net WebClient class and the corresponding Async calls for down/uploading content in a separate thread to avoid laggy UI.</p>  <p>I am now trying to find an easy way to retrieve the callbacks from those async calls on the "unity3d side". Something like the follwing line of code does not work, obviously:</p>  <pre><code>MyManagedPlugin.RequestDataAsync(Callback); </code></pre>  <p>I also would like to avoid any thread specific code on the unity3d side (meaning in the scripts) so that all the async calls are encapsulated in the managed plugin. I am not sure if that is possible at all since there need to be some kind of polling mechanism to on the main thread (unit3d) to check if a thread is done right?</p>
