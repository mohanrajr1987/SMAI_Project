<p>I've made a game in Unity3D(tried it in both Version 4.6 and 5) and it works perfectly fine in the engine. I then proceed to build the game to iOS, after setting all the appropriate settings. I then launch the build in Xcode(Version 6.4) and it opens up fine. The problem arises when I try to run the game, both on a simulator or on an eligible physical device (iPad running iOS 8). The build fails and I receive a code signing error. To be more specific the error I receive is:</p>  <p><code>"Dependancy Analysis Error - Code Sign error. Code signing is required for product type 'Application' in SDK iOS 8.2"</code></p>  <p>I've gone through the setting, changed them to <code>Don't code sign</code>. Building it out of Unity as a development build doesn't help. Is there anything else I need to tweak in order to make it work?</p>  <p>Note: I do not have the paid apple developer membership yet.</p>
