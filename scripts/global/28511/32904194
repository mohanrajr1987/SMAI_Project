<p>I'm having trouble importing the models from maya fbx to unity at the right scale. Detected the problem being inside Unity when importing the fbx file.</p>  <p>There's no really a workaround this other than changing by hand the .meta file</p>  <pre><code>  useFileScale: 0 </code></pre>  <p>But since modelImporter.isFileScaleUsed in Unity is read only can't change the value with a script but I can change the global scale </p>  <pre><code>  globalScale </code></pre>  <p>There might be a solution can't figure out how to do it.</p>  <p>This is the question that I need help with</p>  <p>Say I have File scale at 0.01 the normal value is 1 for scale, how can I calculate 0.01 * 100 = 1 with javascript meaning I need to get the value 100 out of equation, </p>  <pre><code>  0.01 * ? = 1 </code></pre>
