<p>I have the 2d sprite moving automatically, and was just wondering how to increase the speed of this:</p>  <pre><code>transform.Translate(0.10F, -0.03F, 0 * Time.deltaTime); </code></pre>  <p>Have tried setting a speed variable and then doing:</p>  <pre><code>transform.Translate(0.1f,-0.05f,speed*Time.deltaTime); </code></pre>  <p>But this ends up making the background in the game window disappear (because the player is moving off the 2d background via the z axis), whilst in the scene window the player is moving down the map but at the same speed</p>
