<p>I'm doing research on generating planets for a game engine I'm planning to code, and I was wondering what would be the best approach to procedurally generate a planet. (In terms of performance.) So far I've seen the <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/YP4an.png" rel="nofollow">Icosphere</a> and <a href="http://acko.net/files/making-worlds/planets-1-cubemap.png" rel="nofollow">Cubemapped Sphere</a> pop up the most, but I was wondering which of the two is faster to generate. My question is particularly aimed at LOD, since I hope to have gameplay similar to No Man's Sky.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
