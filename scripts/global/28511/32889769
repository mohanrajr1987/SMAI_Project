<p>I want to tilt the Player (dron) if he is moving in any direction (along X and Z axis), just like in Space Schooter tutorial . But in the same time I want to rotate him with the joystick (around Y axis). I am using code like this:</p>  <pre><code>void FixedUpdate() {     float rotation = CrossPlatformInputManager.GetAxis("L_Horizontal");     float vertical_movement = CrossPlatformInputManager.GetAxis("L_Vertical");     Vector3 movement = new Vector3     (         CrossPlatformInputManager.GetAxis("R_Horizontal") * MovementForceMultiplier,         0.0f,         CrossPlatformInputManager.GetAxis("R_Vertical") * MovementForceMultiplier     );       if (DebugInfo) Debug.Log(player.velocity.magnitude);       Player.AddTorque(Vector3.up * rotation / TorqueDivisor);      Player.AddRelativeForce(0.0f, vertical_movement * VerticalForceMultiplier, 0.0f);      if (Player.velocity.magnitude &lt; MaxSpeed)         Player.AddRelativeForce(movement);      Player.rotation = Quaternion.Euler(Player.velocity.z * TiltingMultiplier, Player.rotation.y, -Player.velocity.x * TiltingMultiplier); } </code></pre>  <p>What is happening? Player tilts, but rotation (AddTorque) changes slightly and only from 359 grades to 1 grade (2 grades angle) around Y axis.</p>  <p>I tried to use AddTorque (and AddRelativeTorque as well) for player tilting but it tilts him way too much and it is very hard to make boundaries on maximum rotation. I failed with that.</p>  <p>When I comment the "Player.rotation" changing, rotating player with AddTorque works very well.</p>  <p>I need tilting and rotating, because it has to simulate dron flight. Have you got any ideas, what can I do?</p>
