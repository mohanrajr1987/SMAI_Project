<p>Lately i found that gaming platform providers does not provide protection against hacking and every thing has to be done by the developers itself. So, can somebody give me suggestions to how people hack gaming applications and how to protect it?</p>  <p>Tools that i am using are:-<br> <strong>Game Platform</strong> :- Unity3D<br> <strong>Database (hosted on server)</strong> :- mySQL 5.6<br></p>  <p>Some result that i found on internet are:-</p>  <ol> <li>Variable values can be hacked by using <strong>cheat engine</strong> but can be protected by scrambling memory through Shockwave which again can be hacked by simple search on the internet</li> <li>By using external unity3D obfuscator hackers can un-obfuscate our application. </li> </ol>
