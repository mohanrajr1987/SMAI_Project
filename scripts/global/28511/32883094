<p>I have a <code>button</code> UI game object. That doesn't have an image from the start. I fetch a image from the <code>server</code> and then set it as <code>button</code> image. Here is the code:</p>  <pre><code>WWW w = new WWW (newUrl); yield return w; Adbutton.GetComponent&lt;Image&gt;().sprite =  Sprite.Create(w.texture,new Rect(0, 0, 100, 100),new Vector2(0,0)); </code></pre>  <p>The button does change color but image is not set. Help me out!</p>
