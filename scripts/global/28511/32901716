<p>I want to use canon or third party digital camera in unity for AR-camera options. The only option available in "Camera Device" drop down is "USB Camera".<br> How can I get my device to appear in that list (External Canon Digital Camera)? Refer attached image .  I have connected canon EOS Camera but it is not displayed in the Camera Device drop down. Please help me.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/7iMhz.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/7iMhz.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
