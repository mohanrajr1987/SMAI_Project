<p>I have imported a DLL into Unity, and I am confident it has imported successfully. I have defined a function on the DLL for Unity to use, however whenever it is called, Unity throws me a:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>DllNotFoundException: k8055d.dll</p> </blockquote>  <p>The DLL's function is defined through</p>  <pre><code>[DllImport("k8055d")] public static extern int Version(); </code></pre>  <p>and I get the error when this line is run:</p>  <pre><code>Debug.Log (Version().ToString()); </code></pre>  <p>The reason I know it has found the DLL is that if I set the DLL to use both x64 and x86 architectures within the import settings, I get this error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Failed to load 'Assets/Plugins/k8055d.dll', expected 64 bit architecture (IMAGE_FILE_MACHINE_AMD64), but was IMAGE_FILE_MACHINE_I386. You must recompile your plugin for 64 bit architecture.</p> </blockquote>  <p>But this error disappears when I set it to only use an x86 architecture within the import settings, the console just gives the DLLNotFoundException.</p>  <p>Information about the DLL can be found <a href="http://www.intesiscon.com/ficheros/manuales-tecnicos/54-K8055-DLL-manual.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
