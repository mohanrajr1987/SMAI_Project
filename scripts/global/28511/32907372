<pre><code>void Update () {      Vector3 pos = transform.position;     Vector3 velocity = new Vector3 ( 0  ,-maxspeed * Time.deltaTime  ,0);     pos += transform.rotation * velocity;     transform.position = pos;     gameObject.transform.rotation = new Quaternion (0, 0, 1, 0);   } </code></pre>  <p>This is my script for moving meteorites forward(top to bottom). but i want that my meteorites should rotate around its center. i added one simle line </p>  <p>i.e.</p>  <p><code>gameObject.transform.rotation = new Quaternion (0, 0, 1, 0);</code></p>  <p>but it is not working properly. it is rotating meteorites in arc not around its own center.</p>  <p>I have searched on internet about rotating objects around its center but i didnt get any proper guidance.</p>
