<p>in the mobile game we are designing there exists three somehow similar menus:</p>  <ul> <li>Main Menu (with a bunch of icons like home, settings, share,toggle sound,....)</li> <li>Pause Menu (almost the same with just the text and icon sizes and placement changes)</li> <li>EndGame (very similar to pause menu with options to restart game)</li> </ul>  <p>now, there are at least two ways I can think of creating these menus:</p>  <ul> <li>Create one menu and change positions and sizes of needed icons/texts in script</li> <li>Just create 3 different panels in unity UI and call each one that is needed.</li> </ul>  <p>As the assets used in both cases will be the same (well, in second case maybe more game objects) which one is a better solution? I can write the script as easily as I can create menus (both take almost the same amount of time to develope)</p>
