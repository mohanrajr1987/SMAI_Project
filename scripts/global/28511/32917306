<p>I'm converting a Unity 4 project to Unity 5.  I understand that InteractiveCloth has been changed to Cloth for rendering performance reasons.</p>  <p>In my old project, I was saving the mesh of the InteractiveCloth, so I can restore it to its default state when my level starts over</p>  <pre><code>// save mesh netMeshSave = net.mesh;  public void ResetNetMesh() {     UnityEngine.Object.DestroyObject(net.mesh);     net.mesh = (Mesh)Mesh.Instantiate(netMeshSave);         } </code></pre>  <p>Is there a preferred way to get the mesh from a cloth and restore it in Unity 5?</p>  <p>I can see that Cloth.mesh no longer exists in the Unity 5 api</p>
