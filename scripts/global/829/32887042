<p>I want to build an add in application to Ms Word, using VB.Net 2013. Have already created the ribbon control and placed some buttons on, but I would like to modify the ribbon in such a way that when the user clicks on specific bookmarked parts of the document, specific controls on the ribbon will appear.  How would I go on doing this? How would I detect mouse click events inside the opened document?</p>  <p>Best Regards</p>
