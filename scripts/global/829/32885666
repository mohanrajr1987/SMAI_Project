<p>Are there any examples of how to implement an event aggregator in vb.net? I can find a number of <code>c#</code> example and I've tried converting them but somethings getting lost along the way. Lots of the examples also relate to <code>WPF</code>. I don't know if I'm missing something but I see no reason why this can't be used in <code>winforms</code> - any help would be great. </p>
