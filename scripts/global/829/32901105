<p>I have a list of events for a calendar. I'd like to hyperlink the title or location--though preferably the location (see below) to a website. How do I do this?</p>  <pre><code>var events = [ { date: "2015-10-10", title: 'October 15, 2015', location: 'Event One Deadline' },  { date: "2015-10-25", title: 'October 25, 2015', 'location: 'Payment Deadline' }, { date: "2015-12-25", title: 'December 25, 2015', location: 'Christmas: We're closed.' }, { date: "2015-12-26",    title: 'December 26, 2015', location: 'Boxing Day: We're closed.'}  ]; </code></pre>
