<p>How to send email-notification that will add an event. Using <a href="http://gmail-actions.appspot.com/" rel="nofollow">this tool</a> I sent "event card" to my Gmail and receive an email as well as notification about adding a new event to my calendar. But if I try to send this exactly "event card" content via PHP, for example, than I receive an email, but not new event in my calendar. What am I doing wrong?</p>  <pre><code>&lt;html&gt;   &lt;head&gt;     &lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;     {       "@context": "http://schema.org",       "@type": "EventReservation",       "reservationNumber": "E123456789",       "underName": {         "@type": "Person",         "name": "Andrii Tarykin"       },       "modifiedTime": "2013-11-02T13:15:00-08:00",       "modifyReservationUrl": "http://gmail-actions.appspot.com/success/{{token}}",       "reservationStatus": "confirmed",       "reservationFor": {         "@type": "Event",         "name": "Foo Fighters Concert",         "performer": {           "@type": "Person",           "name": "Metallica",           "image": "http://example.com"         },         "startDate": "2015-10-01T13:07:55",         "location": {           "@type": "Place",           "name": "AT&amp;T Park",           "address": {             "@type": "PostalAddress",             "streetAddress": "24 Willie Mays Plaza",             "addressLocality": "San Francisco",             "addressRegion": "CA",             "postalCode": "94107",             "addressCountry": "US"           }         }       }     }     &lt;/script&gt;   &lt;/head&gt;   &lt;body&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       This a test for an Event reservation Google Now card in Gmail.     &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; </code></pre>  <p>This code doesn't work for me, it doesn't add event in my calendar.</p>
