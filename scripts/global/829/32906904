<p>I really have no piece of code I can show you, because I have no idea how to even begin coding this.</p>  <p>I have to do the following with VB.NET:</p>  <ol> <li>Connect to a local website ( <a href="https://10.0.0.55/" rel="nofollow">https://10.0.0.55/</a> )</li> <li><p>Trigger an event on that specific page (button onClick)</p>  <pre><code>&lt;div onClick="mySubmit('webEvent=START&amp;webSector=0')"&gt;START&lt;/div&gt; </code></pre></li> </ol>  <p>The only thing I know at the moment is that you can connect to the website through the WebClient.</p>  <pre><code>    Dim webClient As New WebClient()     webClient.BaseAddress = "http://10.0.0.55/" </code></pre>  <p>Help would be greatly appreciated.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance,</p>  <p>Jens</p>
