<p>I created an event calendar using <a href="https://github.com/philipehsing/jQuery.Simple-Event-Calendar" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/philipehsing/jQuery.Simple-Event-Calendar</a>. However, I notice that the first of each month is always at the top left corner with the days of the week jumping around. I'd like to have either Monday or Sunday static (so as not to confuse the website visitors). </p>  <p>Ideally, I'd like to have September 2015 as:<br/> Mon Tues Wed Thurs Fri Sat Sun<br/>  &nbsp;&nbsp;31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   2&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6</p>  <p>I can live without the 31 from the previous month being in the current month clicked though.</p>  <p>How would I edit the JavaScript (<a href="https://github.com/philipehsing/jQuery.Simple-Event-Calendar/blob/master/demo/assets/js/simplecalendar.js" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/philipehsing/jQuery.Simple-Event-Calendar/blob/master/demo/assets/js/simplecalendar.js</a>) to achieve this?</p>  <p>If anyone can help, I'd appreciate it. I've been staring at this too long.</p>
