<p>I have created new WPF Project and what I would like to do is set something to do for an app on <code>Startup</code> and <code>Exit</code>.</p>  <p>In <code>App.xaml.cs</code> I have added</p>  <pre><code>public void Application_Startup(object sender, StartupEventArgs e) {     //code here } </code></pre>  <p>And</p>  <pre><code>private void Application_Exit(object sender, ExitEventArgs e) {     // code here } </code></pre>  <p>In <code>App.xaml</code> I have added to generated code:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;Application      ...     Startup="Application_Startup"     Exit="Application_Exit"     StartupUri="MainWindow.xaml" &gt; </code></pre>  <p>What I am getting is an error (when I try to build the app):</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Error 1   'abc.App' does not contain a definition for   'Application_Startup' and no extension method 'Application_Startup'   accepting a first argument of type 'abc.App' could be found (are you   missing a using directive or an assembly   reference?)   D:\abc\App.xaml 4   73  abc</p> </blockquote>  <p>I have tried to comment <code>StartupUri</code> or change it into <code>App.xaml</code> but without effect.</p>  <p>May anyone point me what I am doing wrong in this case ?</p>  <p>edit: @user2946329 I have such a options like in this image. </p>  <p><a href="http://i57.tinypic.com/212z4h3.png" rel="nofollow">http://i57.tinypic.com/212z4h3.png</a> ( cannot upload here my picture because of lack of reputation)</p>  <p>I am reading about This <code>Navigate to Event Handler</code></p>
