<p>I like the way that events are handled using the Laravel framework - you raise a new event when something happens which can then be broadcasted. </p>  <pre><code>new UserWasRegistered($id); </code></pre>  <p>As far as I know, this type of thing is possible in .NET C#, but the architecture feels more obtuse - you need to use delegates and functions that match the delegate signature.  Is there a way to deal with Events in .NET that is similar to the way Laravel handles them?</p>
