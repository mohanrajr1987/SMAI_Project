<p>Note: All event pub-sub in my question is via jQuery's on()/trigger()</p>  <p>I have a module (called Header) in my application that triggers a custom event ('Header:init') at some point of time. This event will be triggered exactly once.</p>  <p>Many other modules in the application subscribe to this event. I would like the event handlers in these modules to execute if the 'Header:init' event triggered before the handlers were attached. Else the handlers execute as expected (once 'Header:init' is fired).</p>  <p>I hope I am clear in what I require - the functionality is much like the standard 'ready' event of jQuery - handlers execute as soon as they are attached if DOM is ready, else they execute once DOM is ready.</p>  <p>To reiterate, 'Header:init' is triggered exactly once.</p>  <p>How can I do this? I do't want any variables floating around the application for this. Looking for a clean solution - preferably, just the way ready event works. I checked jQuery site for any event hooks provided by jQuery for this, but everything in centered on browser events like click etc. and none for custom ones.</p>  <p>Appreciate any kind of pointers.</p>  <hr>  <p>Edit: To state clearly the requirement...</p>  <p>Time x : Some module subscribing to the Header:init event has code below and gets executed now...</p>  <p>$( document ).on( 'Header:init', function() {   /* the handler */     ... });</p>  <p>Time x + 1 : Suppose the Header module triggered the event now (i.e. a later point of time)</p>  <p>$( document ).trigger( 'Header:init' );</p>  <p>My requirement is the handler should still be executed.</p>
