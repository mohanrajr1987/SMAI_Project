<p>I try to (as the title suggests) access a submit-event via jQuery, after it was inserted via the <code>jQuery.html(</code>) function. The problem is: On a form, that is NOT inserted via .html(), the event triggers, but on the inserted form, it does not.</p>  <p>Some code:</p>  <pre><code>var makeTransition = function(card) { // Managing transitions via velocity.js // This is not important! $(".card").velocity("transition.slideUpBigOut", {   stagger: 40,   duration: 800,   complete: function() {     $('.card').html(card); // The important part   } }); $(".card").velocity("transition.slideUpBigIn", {   stagger: 40,   duration: 800 }); };   var fullHtml = template.html(); // get mustache template (the form!) data = {   user: user,   card: card }; var rendered = Mustache.render(fullHtml, data); makeTransition(rendered); // Basically does $(element).html(form) </code></pre>  <p>The function triggers, whenever there's a message from the server that says "now show the form" (via PubNub, but I guess that is not important).</p>
