<p>I have a workflow which send a reminder email 2 hours before and event starts.</p>  <p>The conditions are is simply: Add -2 hours to the start time of the event 1 - If event is due more than 2 hours later - Pause until the reminder time 2 - If the event is due within the reminder period (2 hours) or less away, send email 3 - If the event has started, don't do anything</p>  <p>The issue I have is as follows:</p>  <p>If I create a single event - it works fine , even with the pause.</p>  <p>However, when I create recurring events, the child events do not se their owne start time value - they use the parent start time value. (I logged the values in the history to check)</p>  <p>If I edit the child item on it's own, it works fine. If I edit the series, it picks of the parent event start time. I've tried modifying the series by using a child event as well as parent event and still same outcome?</p>  <p>Any help is appreciated?</p>
