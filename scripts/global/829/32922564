<p>There is requirement in application such that, When user clicks a button, then an event will be automatically created in calendar. Now there should be some link\ text in description such that when user clicks that then application should open. If that application is not installed then the link should open in browser. Please don't redirect me to other stack overflow links. I have searched a lot but haven't find a suitable answer.  </p>
