<p>I am making program which is using tesseract, opencv, SDL, word automation and maybe other libraries in future, written on C++. What is the best GUI I can make(MFC,C++/CLI,ATL,WTL,C#) - fastest for development? Is tesseract, opencv, SDL libraries written on unmnaged or managed C++? Is there a way unmanaged library written on C++ to be used in C++/CLR or C#? Also I heared about something like "Services". Do they allow combination of languages and GUI development and which is better(or faster for developing) -> dll or services?</p>
