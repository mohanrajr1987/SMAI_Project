<p>I am new Java web service programmer and I am looking to see why I see 2 instances of my service being created when I have 2 web pages open to it (One over localhost and another from a different PC using the server PC's IP address and web service URL).</p>  <p>Stack details: Using Tomcat, Java web service under Windows 7 PC. </p>  <p>I have a small web service that connects to a black box internally. Each time I bring up the web service and open up a URL associated with it, I can see the details from the black box. The problem is, when I have 2 web pages open to the web service (One over localhost and another from a different PC using the server PC's IP address and web service URL), I see two instances of the service being created and that are trying to connect to one black box at the same time. I need the ability to start the connect to the black box remotely or locally. But, only the localhost connection should win. I tried creating a servlet to start the service when Tomcat startup but not much luck with it. With the servlet, I see  my autowired Datasource connection is null. </p>  <p>Any idea on this would help.</p>  <p>@Repository public class HServiceDAO  {</p>  <pre><code>@Autowired private DataSource mySql_dataSrc; </code></pre>  <p>web.xml</p>  <pre><code>&lt;servlet&gt;     &lt;servlet-name&gt;StartWebApp&lt;/servlet-name&gt;     &lt;servlet-class&gt;com.StartWebApp&lt;/servlet-class&gt;     &lt;load-on-startup&gt;1&lt;/load-on-startup&gt; &lt;/servlet&gt;    </code></pre>
