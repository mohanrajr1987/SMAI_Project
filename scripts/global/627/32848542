<p>I want to create a Single Sign-On framework for Android where different independent apps may share one single <code>account</code> and <code>accountType</code>, respectively. Right now, all different apps use the exact same <code>AccountAuthenticator</code> and <code>AuthenticatorService</code> (as described in the <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/sync-adapters/creating-authenticator.html" rel="nofollow">Android Developer Docs</a>).</p>  <p>When I try updating one specific App with the respective <code>AuthenticatorService</code> the service doesn't get updated in the Android OS, i.e. still the old service is used regardless which app I use. I think this is due to the fact that the <code>accountType</code> is still bound to the old <code>AuthenticatorService</code> from an app that has not been updated right now.</p>  <p>My Question ist now: How can I prioritize the newly installed <code>AuthenticatorService</code> making it responsible for all accounts of the respective <code>accountType</code> even though there are still apps with the 'old' <code>AuthenticatorService</code> installed. </p>  <p>(Background: I cannot update all apps at the same time but still need to make sure that apps can use the new <code>AuthenticatorService</code> as soon as they get updated)</p>  <p>Thank you in advance!</p>
