<p>In onActivityResult, I wanted to stop and restart the service. But now I'm not even able to stop the service with the code below. </p>  <pre><code>if (requestCode == DEVICE_SELECTION) {         if(resultCode == RESULT_OK)         {             Intent i = new Intent(this, MyService.class);             stopService(i);         } } </code></pre>  <p>In debugging mode, it is able to reach the stopService() line, but the app never calls the onDestroy() of MyService class (which extends the Service class) and the service is not destroyed.</p>  <p>Does anyone have any idea why that is the case?</p>  <p>My service can be started properly and I am able to destroy the service when stopService() is called in onDestroy() method of the Activity which indicates to me that my service class is implemented correctly.</p>
