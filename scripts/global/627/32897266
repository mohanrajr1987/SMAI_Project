<p>so i'm working on an app that is very simple (its a chat app)</p>  <p>i have a server and android users.</p>  <p>for example say we have 2 users, user_a and user_b. user_a enters a chat room and sends "hi user_b" (user_b is registered to this chat room) when user_a sends his message, it is also sent to the server.</p>  <p>i'd like to make a service that will be running always in the background even when the app isn't running. that service will check for new updates each time.</p>  <p>so i'd like user_b to recieve the message,and it will appear as notification.</p>  <p>in order to do it my approch is to make a service that will continuesly run in the background. any suggestations?</p>  <p>Thank You!</p>
