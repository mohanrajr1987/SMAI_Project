<p>I have created an application on OpenShift. This consists out of 1 pod and 1 service. It's possbile to curl to the ip of my service (on my server). So I can read it's code. For example:</p>  <pre><code>curl 172.30.82.121:8080 </code></pre>  <p>A service is using a private IP. So it's only accessible on the server. But I want to see the application in a browser which is not running on the server. Is this possible to do and how?</p>
