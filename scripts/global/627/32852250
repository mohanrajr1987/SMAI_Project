<p>I have created a script that deploys java programms that have to run on startup. I wrote a litte template that is customised by the script and adds it into /etc/systemd/system/ServerName.service</p>  <pre><code>[Unit] Description= ServerName Java Daemon  [Service] ExecStart=/usr/lib/jvm/java/bin/java -jar PathToFile.jar  User=psadmin  [Install] WantedBy=multi-user.target # Similar to runlevel 5 </code></pre>  <p>I have added the user psadmin in visudo to run systemctl without beeing promted for the password. This works pretty fine for starting the service with sudo systemctl start ServerName.service. Then the script reloads the systemctl daemon, "sudo systemctl daemon-reload".</p>  <p>When the script executes the part with systemctl enable ServerName.service, I get in return "Failed to issue method call:Access denied".</p>  <p>When I do this by hand under the same user context I get in return "Failed to issue method call: Invalid argument", but it works and the service is enabled. Thanks for any hints!</p>
