<p>I've been searching the site but I can't find an answer to my question. I'd like to get an instance of a running Android service. Is there a way on how to do that?  <strong>For example:</strong> I want to get a reference of the <code>TextToSpeech</code> service, how can I do that in android? My purpose is that I want to <strong>pause/stop voice talkback</strong> if the currently selected device language is not supported by the its engine. Is that possible?</p>
