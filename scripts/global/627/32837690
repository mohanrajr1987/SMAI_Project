<p>We have MFC application which has several UIs and different services are interacting with UI. Will it be possible to guess (I am saying guess because there can be more than one service is used by UI or vice versa.) which service is actually interacting with my UI?</p>  <p>I tried to use Process Explorer and Spy++ but no luck so far.</p>  <p>Some services are .Net services others are native Windows services. </p>
