<p>With the news of Microsoft discontinuing the development of their Sync Framework, I am needing to find a replacement for an application.  I have not found any suitable replacements online, nor have I found any places online that talks about building your own.  With thinking about this I am wanting it to not be built into the application itself, but actually a service so other applications are able to use it if needed. </p>  <p>Are there any sources of information online that I'm able to view to get a good grasp on creating my own service/framework for file syncing?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
