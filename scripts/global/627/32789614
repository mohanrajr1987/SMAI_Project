<p>I have a bluetooth service that I have been using in my app, but I am just wondering what benefits do I get by using a service to handle all the bluetooth stuff over just creating a <code>bluetoothManager</code> class? Services seem a little complicated with all this <code>bind()</code> stuff. The only benefit I can see from having a service is if you wanted to open your service for other apps to use.</p>
