<p>I localized my app in Italian and English, using the Localizable.strings file and the NSLocalizedString macro. I also enabled base localization. Everything works fine in the simulator and on devices with iOS 8, but on iOS 9 the app is always in english, even on devices with the italian language selected as default in the iPhone settings. Does iOS 9 changes something with localization?</p>  <p>Here's a screenshot of the Xcode localization settings<br> <a href="http://i.imgur.com/xc20yjj.png?1" rel="nofollow">http://i.imgur.com/xc20yjj.png?1</a></p>  <p>And of the device used for testing<br> <a href="http://i.imgur.com/QCjn52u.png" rel="nofollow">http://i.imgur.com/QCjn52u.png</a></p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
