<p>Since I create iOS Apps I use the following code to translate / localize my apps:</p>  <pre><code>NSString *language = [[NSLocale preferredLanguages] objectAtIndex:0]; if ([language isEqualToString:@"de"]) {     // localized language } else { //base language } </code></pre>  <p>But since the update to iOS 9 this code does not work anymore. All my apps are now in English.</p>  <p>Neither the apps I already have in the app store, nor the apps I run in the Simulator are localized anymore.</p>  <p>It would be great if you could tell me how I have to translate my code programmatically in iOS 9.</p>
