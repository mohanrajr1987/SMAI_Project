<p>I am developing a multilingual Struts2 application, and I have quite a few actions which are dealing with <code>Calendar</code> properties. The default type conversion works most of the time, however in some locales I would like to change the default format used. </p>  <p>Specifically I would like to have the dates in English locale to follow the <code>yyyy-MM-dd</code> format. However, this does not work (strangely <code>yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm</code> works fine, but in this case I do not want to have a time part), as Struts2 expect dates in English locale to look different.</p>  <p>So, I would like to change the expected format of the conversion. I am looking for a sane solution for this. The options I have already tried:</p>  <ul> <li>A) Own <code>StrutsTypeConverter</code>. This should work, but I could not inject the format specified in the <code>package.properties</code> file into it.</li> <li>B) Changing the getter/setter pair, to use <code>String</code> instead - works, but this is <em>not a sane solution</em>.</li> </ul>  <p>How to fix the <strong>solution A</strong>? Or is there an alternative approach? Of course, if this can be done entirely in configuration, that would be the best.</p>
