<p>I have a Swift framework built using Xcode 7. All is working fine, and now I want to add internationalization/localization support.</p>  <p>I've reviewed the WWDC 2014 video "Localizing with Xcode 6" (<a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2014/" rel="nofollow">https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2014/</a>) which discusses localizing an app.</p>  <p>However, it looks like I can't "Use Base Internationalization" to localize my storyboards in my framework project. When I try to enable the "Use Base Internationalization" project setting, the pop-up dialog shows an empty list of resource files.</p>  <p>(Note that I can choose the "Export For Localization..." Xcode menu option to export strings that are defined with NSLocalizedString in code.)</p>  <p>Is there something different that is required for Framework projects to support internationalization of storyboard resources?</p>
