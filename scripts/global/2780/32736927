<p>I'm trying to translate the context menu entries in our e4 RCP application, such as "Close" and "Close All" in the PartStacks context menu.</p>  <p>Since I saw the Babel Plugin doing exactly that for the Eclipse IDE, I checked out their code and how they were doing it. It seems that they added a plugin </p>  <blockquote>   <p>org.eclipse.e4.ui.model.workbench.nl_de</p> </blockquote>  <p>which contains a "message_de.properties" under the same folder/package structure as the default "message.properties", namely "org.eclipse.e4.ui.internal.workbench.renderers.swt".</p>  <p>Well, I tried that in our own application but - as I expected - it didn't work. What am I missing? I guess I'm missing some important points here, as the whole logic of having messages.properties files, rather than hard coded strings is to allow for localization, right?</p>
