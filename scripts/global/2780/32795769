<p>I have a localized OS X app. There are several languages supported, the Base localization is English:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/hFb7k.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/hFb7k.png" alt="Xcode screenshot"></a></p>  <p>When testing on Mountain Lion, the app behaves strangely. It refuses to run in English, as if the localization was missing. (On modern OS X versions it works just fine.)</p>  <p>What could be the problem? I tried duplicating the <code>Base.lproj</code> folder from the app bundle as <code>en.lproj</code> and the problem disappeared. Is this a problem with Base Internationalization support in older OS X versions?</p>
