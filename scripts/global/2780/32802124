<p>Accoding to Andy Wigley on this video <a href="https://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/en-US/training-courses/a-developer-s-guide-to-windows-10-12618" rel="nofollow">https://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/en-US/training-courses/a-developer-s-guide-to-windows-10-12618</a> (look in additional resources -> Localization), UPW apps download only the culture resources they need. </p>  <p>I'm writing an app that uses resource files not only to translate UI but also generate files for the user. User may want to generate files in different culture than the one the OS uses. How I can assure that e.g. if my system is in en-US I will be able to get resources in french?</p>  <p>I may use own XML files that all will be included in the app. But some of the resource for sure will be needed also in UI, so I don't want to duplicate the resources and have to translate them twice.</p>
