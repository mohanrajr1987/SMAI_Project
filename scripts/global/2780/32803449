<p>I have an xib file with multiple localization (.strings) files. </p>  <p>If I change the language option in the device's settings, the language of my xib changes accordingly.</p>  <p>I would like to be able to change the language within the app, so when I load a new view controller, I would like it to load the corresponding xib using the localization file of my choice instead of the one given by the device's preferences.</p>  <p>What's the best way to achieve this?</p>  <p>EDIT: I think you can achieve this by duplicating the xib file for each language, but I would like to have only one xib and use the desired language file to load its data. </p>
