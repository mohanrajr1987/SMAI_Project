<p>I'm trying to localize numbers based only on the user's default locale, which is all that I need.  I had been doing this with .toLocaleString(), which does all I need it to do.  However, Safari doesn't support this really.  I also looked into the JavaScript Intl api, which also isn't supported by Safari, and a library like Globalize, which is just much bigger that I want or need.  Any suggestions on a toLocaleString() equivalent that works in Safari?</p>
