<p>I am using <a href="https://github.com/angular-translate/angular-translate" rel="nofollow">angular-translate</a> and its extension <a href="https://github.com/angular-translate/bower-angular-translate-loader-static-files" rel="nofollow">angular-translate-loader-static-files</a> to i18 my angular app. Both the required JS files are included in the index.html. </p>  <p>Everything works as expected except that the screen shows the raw message code for a second before we can see the translated messages. I think that happens because the enUS.json (the message translation json) is fetched using an ajax call and until its completed, raw message codes get displayed.</p>  <p>Is there any way of fixing this?</p>
