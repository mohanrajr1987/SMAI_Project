<p>I was using the L5.1 localization but no matter what I do the language stays to the default config/app.php settings locale. </p>  <pre><code> Route::get('setlanguage/{locale}', function ($locale) {     Session::set('locale', $locale);     App::setLocale(session('locale')); //tried with setLocale('es') too      return redirect()-&gt;back(); }); </code></pre>  <p>tried creating middlewares, controllers. Nothing works. I've never used this feature on my Windows Xampp server. I've always used this on Linux. Idk if permissions have anything to do with this. Idk it just doesn't change the default config of language. Also trans or Lang::get does not work on different language other than english.</p>
