<p>I am creating an application where i have used english and arabic language. I have created this application with autolayout. The tricky part i am facing is that user can change the language settings from the application as well. </p>  <p>Autolayout is working fine if i change the language from the device settings app.But when i change the language from my application, I have to re-start the app to localize the content as well as it does not localize the xib's. Is there any way to achieve this for localizing xib using autolayout to change it for hebrew (Right to Left) language without creating different xibs. I want my xib's get localize for arabic text as well, If i change the language from the settings app. Please help. Thanks</p>
