<p>I have an application and I want to add a mix of static and dynamic app shortcut items.  Localizing for dynamic items is pretty straightforward, using <code>NSLocalizedString</code>, but not so much with the items in your info.plist.  I already have an InfoPlist.strings file for localizing the name of my application, but I am less sure about how static <code>UIApplicationShortcutItems</code> would work since these items do not have a unique key.</p>  <p><strong>How do you localize static UIApplicationShortcutItems?</strong></p>
