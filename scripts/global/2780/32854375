<p>Just spend another evening, trying to figure that out. Here is what I am doing:</p>  <p>1) Creating a clean project with tabbed iOS application in XCode 6.3.1;</p>  <p>2) Under Project/Info/Localisations I am adding another localisation (Russian,German, doesn't matter)</p>  <p>3) In Main.strings file, changing corresponding strings, OR doing exactly the same by Exporting/Importing .xliff file.</p>  <p>4) Deleting app from simulator/device, cleaning project from Product/Clean, deleting derived app data from corresponding folder</p>  <p>5) Changing language in simulator/device</p>  <p>6) Making a run... Still English. Localised strings just wont pick up, no matter what.(even though they are looks just fine trough assistant editor)</p>  <p>What am I doing wrong? Is that suppose to be that complicated?</p>
