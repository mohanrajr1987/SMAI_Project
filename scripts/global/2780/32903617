<p>I know that such question can easily be marked as off topic, but I'm sure that others could fall into the same problem and require the community help.</p>  <p>I was creating a Hebrew speaking app, and finally submitted it to Apple for review. It was rejected with the following message:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Upon launching the app, it opens a blank page and the app content is   not loaded. In addition there is no loading indicator to suggest that   the app is loading.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I simply cannot understand where this is coming from!</p>  <p>I was testing the app on every device I could put my hands on, with any iOS between 5.1 and 9.0.2, and never got any problem. <strong>I am not loading any resources on startup, and I always see the main screen appearing after 1 sec of loading time</strong>. Was trying to ask the review team for more details, but got again the same message. Where can I go from here?</p>  <p>I was wondering if this could happen due to region selection in the device. in my  <code>main.c</code>, I'm having this right before calling <code>UIApplicationMain</code>:</p>  <pre><code>[[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] setObject:[NSArray arrayWithObjects:@"he", @"en", nil] forKey:@"AppleLanguages"]; [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] synchronize]; //to make the change immediate </code></pre>  <p>I'm doing it in order to enforce the Hebrew localization because this is the only implemented localization as for now.</p>  <p>However I changed both language and region to French/France and re-installed from TestFlight, and everything works as expected.</p>  <p>Does anyone have anything to suggest please?</p>
