<p>I have been trying to build program in order to support RSSI+trilateration based localization scheme for motes in cooja. I could not be able to understand how to print the output locations for the motes after the program runs. Due to this, I am stuck. Can anyone please guide on how to create program and what could be the output produced? My expected output is the location of motes at different instances.</p>
