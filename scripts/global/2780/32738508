<p>While achieving localization of my theme, I am getting a warning <br /></p>  <blockquote>   <p>Warning: fopen(C:\xampp\htdocs/wp-content/themes/themename/languages): failed to open stream: Permission denied in C:\xampp\htdocs\wp-includes\pomo\streams.php on line 145** <br />   When I comment line for loading text_domain in functions.php as follows <br />       <code>// load_textdomain( 'themename', get_template_directory() . '/languages' );</code> <br />   aforementioned warning doesn't show up.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I have uploaded required .po and .mo files in <code>themename/languages</code> folder.</p>  <p>I have also set WP_LANG to hi_IN in WP-CONFIG.php. <br /></p>  <p>I am using xampp installation of wordpress on localhost on my windows machine.<br /></p>  <p>PHP Version 5.5.11<br /> Apache/2.4.9 (Win32) OpenSSL/1.0.1g PHP/5.5.11<br /> So how can I get rid of this warning and achieve localization?</p>
