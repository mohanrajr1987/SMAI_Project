<p>What's current best practice for language localisation and auto-detection in HTML? I've tried to find a definitive guide that seems up to date, but all I find seems rather old, so I'm guessing there's a HTML5 style standardised approach?</p>  <p>For content ideally I'd like to avoid databases, but I'm happy to link to a JSON or CSV file.</p>  <p>I'd like the URLs to be elegant i.e. site.com/es/ or site.com/de/</p>
