<p>I am using an EKEventEditViewController to add and edit events in my app. When the app is installed the controller uses the language of the app.</p>  <p>Now I close the app and change the app language. I reopen the app and everything is in the new language - everything but the controller. Now I close and reopen the app again and suddenly also the controller uses the correct language.</p>  <p>Another example: Change language - reopen: controller is using language from before. Close app - change language again - reopen: controller is using language I changed to the first time.</p>  <p>I want the EKEventEditViewController to use the correct language the first time I open the app. Does anyone have any ideas what is going wrong here?</p>
