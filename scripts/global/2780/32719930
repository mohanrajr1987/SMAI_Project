<p>I'm trying to get localization working in my application. I have my ui resource files, named "ui.resx" and "ui.de.resx" in my solution. However, something in my implementation is incorrect, and I'm stumped.</p>  <pre><code>ResourceManager res_man; CultureInfo culture; string exception;  private void myForm_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) {     culture = CultureInfo.CreateSpecificCulture("de");     res_man = new ResourceManager("MyApp.ui.resx", typeof(myForm).Assembly);     doTheThing(); }  private void doTheThing() {     try     {         BTN_save.text = ui.SAVE;         //Do code here     }     catch(Exception e)     {         exception = e.toString();     } } </code></pre>  <p>When I run the program, it errors out and exception reads:</p>  <p>"Exception: System.Resources.MissingManifestResourceException: Could not find any resources appropriate for the specified culture or the neutral culture. Make sure "ui.resx.resources" was correctly embedded or linked into assembly "myProgram" at compile time, or that all the satellite assemblies required are loadable and fully signed."</p>
