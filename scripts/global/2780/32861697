<p>I have a legacy iOS application designed using nib files and the UI alignment  of the application is designed for arabic (Right-to-Left), then I try to add English localization to the nib files I do the following </p>  <ol> <li>I added "Localizations" key the .plist file of the project as Array and then I added the following items under "Localizations"  (item0 : English, item1: Arabic)</li> <li>I added "Localization native development region" set its value to "ar".</li> <li>Then I opened the project.pbxproj and change the value of "developmentRegion"   "developmentRegion = ar;"</li> </ol>  <p>I get the following result as in the image</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/hvVGv.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/hvVGv.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>The problem is when set the language of the applications to Arabic (RTL alignment) , iOS mirror the views from RTL(Right-to-Left) to LTR(Left-to-Right), I guess that iOS always consider UI for Left-to-Right languages and mirrors the views for RTL even if the native development languages is RTL language.</p>  <p>the question is does iOS consider the UI is for LTR languages even if the localization development language is RTL for example arabic ?</p>  <p>Any help will be appreciated</p>
