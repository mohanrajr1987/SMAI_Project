<p>From what I understand, localizing Storyboard objects is fairly straightforward: you have a file that looks something like this:</p>  <pre><code>/* Class = "NSMenuItem"; title = "Superscript"; ObjectID = "Rqc-34-cIF"; */ "Rqc-34-cIF.title" = "Superscript";  /* Class = "NSMenuItem"; title = "Select All"; ObjectID = "Ruw-6m-B2m"; */ "Ruw-6m-B2m.title" = "Select All";  /* Class = "NSTextFieldCell"; placeholderString = "0"; ObjectID = "RxW-oS-gX3"; */ "RxW-oS-gX3.placeholderString" = "0";  /* Class = "NSTextFieldCell"; title = "0"; ObjectID = "RxW-oS-gX3"; */ "RxW-oS-gX3.title" = "0";  /* Class = "NSMenuItem"; title = "Jump to Selection"; ObjectID = "S0p-oC-mLd"; */ "S0p-oC-mLd.title" = "Jump to Selection";  /* Class = "NSButtonCell"; title = "Play"; ObjectID = "qjC-b0-dMe"; */ "qjC-b0-dMe.title" = "Play"; </code></pre>  <p>and to localize each string, you just replace the text on the right with its localized equivalent. Easy enough. </p>  <p>However, what if the code is displaying a label or dialog box, where the string is defined in the code? For example:</p>  <pre><code>if (dialogOKCancel("Invalid Path", text: "The file/path you selected does not exist, is not a valid sound file, or cannot be accessed by the program.")) {     self.dismissController(self) } </code></pre>  <p>or </p>  <pre><code>let result = dialogOKCancel("Discard Changes?", text: "Press Cancel to close this window and save your changes to \(filename), or OK to create a new file.") </code></pre>  <p>I know there are a number of different ways I could do it (defining strings at startup according to localization settings detected by the app was one thing I thought of), but I'm wondering if there's a 'correct'/official way to do what I'm trying to accomplish, or if not, what the best/most efficient method is.</p>
