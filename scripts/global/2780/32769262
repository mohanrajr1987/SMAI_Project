<p>There are certain buttons in iOS that are automatically localized by the system. These can be found in controls like <code>UIBarButtonSystemItem</code>. Is there any way to access those system translations?</p>  <p>For example, i want to create a delete button in a view, with the "delete" text. I don't want to bother localising it using strings, i'd want to use the translations already available to the system. Is there any way to do this?</p>
