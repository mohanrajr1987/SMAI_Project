<p>in order to localize my App, I use the following code:</p>  <pre><code>NSString * language = [[NSLocale preferredLanguages] objectAtIndex:0];                if ([language isEqualToString:@"fr"]) {   }else{   }   </code></pre>  <p>But since iOS 9, I'have to replace "fr" by "fr-FR". The problem is that only works for France. How can I support all the other regions (Canada, Belgium,..) ? and the "general setting" for french ?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
