<p>I recently added values-de to my android project. As my mobile is set to german, the correct german resources are being pulled. but since the creation of values-de getActionBar() returns null. In english everything is fine, but in german the actionBar does not seem to be created. also the options menu and everything that comes with it does not work anymore.</p>  <p>Any suggestions?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
