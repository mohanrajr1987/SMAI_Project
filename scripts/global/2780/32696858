<p>I'm trying to display dates in an Angular site. I use:</p>  <p><code>{{ item.date | date:'short'}}</code> but I keep getting the dates as formatted in the en_US locale (Month/Day/Year Hour:Minute AM/PM) . I checked my browser's locale using <a href="http://mybrowserinfo.com/detail.asp?bhcp=1" rel="nofollow">My Brwoser Info</a>, and it is most certainly not a US locale - it is set to Israel as it should be.</p>  <p>By the way, item.date (before the filter) contains the date as follows: 2015-09-06T12:15:27.673Z.</p>
