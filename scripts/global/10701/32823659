<p>I am new to C#, and working with HttpWebRequest class. I am testing webrequest's cache policy. But after some test cases it seems that cache policy is not working properly. I am checking IsFromCache property, and it every time gives false value.</p>  <p>Is there something i am missing?, or can anyone give an example which gives proper values of cache policy.</p>  <p>Thanks,</p>
