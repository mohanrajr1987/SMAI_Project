<p>I am running PowerShell v3 and I would like to use PowerShell to login to a remote website that requires a user login and password. I have searched Google and I cannot find how to do this. I did try the following bit of code but it didn't work:</p>  <pre class="lang-psh prettyprint-override"><code>$HTTP_Request = [System.Net.WebRequest]::Create($uri) $creds = new-object System.Net.NetworkCredential $global:USERNAME, $global:USERPASS $newURI = new-object System.Uri $uri $credcache = new-object System.Net.CredentialCache $credcache.Add($newURI, "Basic", $creds) $HTTP_Request.Credentials = $credcache $HTTP_Response = $HTTP_Request.GetResponse() $HTTP_Status = [int]$HTTP_Response.StatusCode </code></pre>  <p>What am I doing wrong?</p>  <p><strong>Additional Info</strong></p>  <p>I noticed some very strange behaviour in the responses I have received. PowerShell will return an error saying that the site is returning '401 unauthorized.' However, if I visit the site manually in a browser, I receive a 404. Why don't these return codes match up?</p>  <p>On another link, PowerShell returns 'Too many automatic redirections were attempted.' Again visiting with a browser returns a login page. Even increasing the max number of allowed redirections, results in the same message being returned by PowerShell. I am beginning to think PowerShell is broken.</p>
