<p>I've read other questions about this topic but they don't match my case. This is the cURL call I want to translate:</p>  <pre><code>curl -u "{username}":"{password}"         -F data=@data.csv      -F metadata="{\"language\":\"en\",\"name\":\"Title\"}"      "https://example.com" </code></pre>  <p>I know how to set credentials and the method for the requested url, but i don't know how to move forward. They seem to be two files: csv the first one, json the second one.</p>  <pre><code>HttpWebRequest request = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create("https://example.com"); request.Method = "POST";                 request.Credentials = new NetworkCredential("username", "password"); </code></pre>
