<p>I want to "simulate" navigation through a website and parse the responses.</p>  <p>I just want to make sure i am doing something reasonable before i start, I saw 2 options to do so:</p>  <ol> <li>Using the WebBrowser class.</li> <li>Using the HttpWebRequest class.</li> </ol>  <p>So my initial though was to use HttpWebRequest and just parse the response.</p>  <p>What do you guys think?</p>  <p>Also wanted to ask,i use c# cause its my strongest language, but what are common languages used to do such stuff as mining from websites?</p>
