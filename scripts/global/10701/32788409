<p>I'm hoping you can help me with this. I've been Googling all morning and trying all the solutions I could find or think of myself. The site I'm trying to load is running TLS1.2 as is a few other sites I tried to test with to make sure it wasn't a TLS1.2 issue. The other sites loaded fine.</p>  <pre><code>                byte[] buffer = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes("mod=www&amp;ssl=1&amp;dest=account_settings.ws&amp;username=" + username.Replace(" ", "20%") + "&amp;password=" + password.Replace(" ", "20%"));                  ServicePointManager.MaxServicePointIdleTime = 1000;                 ServicePointManager.SecurityProtocol = SecurityProtocolType.Tls;                  HttpWebRequest WebReq = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create("https://secure.runescape.com/m=weblogin/login.ws");                  WebReq.Method = "POST";                 WebReq.KeepAlive = false;                  WebReq.Referer = "https://secure.runescape.com/m=weblogin/loginform.ws?mod=www&amp;ssl=1&amp;expired=0&amp;dest=account_settings.ws";                 WebReq.ContentType = "application/x-www-form-urlencoded";                 WebReq.ContentLength = buffer.Length;                 Stream PostData = WebReq.GetRequestStream();                 PostData.Write(buffer, 0, buffer.Length);                 PostData.Close();                 HttpWebResponse WebResp = (HttpWebResponse)WebReq.GetResponse();                 Stream Answer = WebResp.GetResponseStream();                 StreamReader _Answer = new StreamReader(Answer);                 reply = _Answer.ReadToEnd();                 curAccount++;                 if (reply.Contains("Login Successful"))                 {                     return true;                 }                 else                 {                     return false;                 } </code></pre>  <p>No matter what I try I keep getting the exception <code>The underlying connection was closed: An unexpected error occurred on a send.</code></p>  <p>Under more details I found <code>Authentication failed because the remote party has closed the transport stream.</code></p>
