<p>The situation is that I have a web form that, on postback, I want to load the content of another web form in the same ASP.Net website for the purpose of feeding the resulting html into wkhtmltopdf. I tried feeding wkhtmltopdf a URL, but it was timing out, so I decided to load the HTML content and feed it to wkhtmltopdf, but found that I'm still timing out, so the issue seems to not lie with wkhtmltopdf.</p>  <p>This is the method I'm using to load the page content:</p>  <pre><code>    private string LoadPageContent(string url)     {         string         pageContent;         HttpWebRequest client = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(url);          client.Proxy = null;         client.CookieContainer = new CookieContainer();          foreach (string cookieName in Request.Cookies) {             var    myCookie = Request.Cookies[cookieName];             Cookie cookie = new Cookie             {                 Domain = Request.Url.Host,                 Expires = myCookie.Expires,                 Name = myCookie.Name,                 Path = myCookie.Path,                 Secure = myCookie.Secure,                 Value = myCookie.Value             };              client.CookieContainer.Add(cookie);         }          using (WebResponse response = client.GetResponse()) {         using (Stream data = response.GetResponseStream())         using (StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(data))             pageContent = sr.ReadToEnd();         }          return pageContent;     } </code></pre>  <p>What seems to happen is that the process hangs on the line where I call client.GetResponse(), for what seems like the default timeout period. There's a timeout exception thrown.  Then, the page I'm calling begins to process (I put a breakpoint on the first line of the Page_Load event).</p>  <p>This happens both when debugging locally on my workstation and on our production server.  I verified in the IIS logs that there's a delay between the POST when I click the button, and when the GET fires to load the other page content.</p>  <p>Things I've tried that haven't fixed the problem:</p>  <ul> <li>Setting WebRequest.Proxy to null</li> <li>Changing the network connection setting in Internet Explorer to NOT "Automatically detect settings"</li> <li>Set maxConnections to 500 in system.web -> connectionManagement in the web.config</li> <li>Set user-agent string in the WebRequest object</li> <li>Tried calling the LoadPageContent method asynchronously</li> </ul>  <p>I'm pretty well out of ideas at this point, would appreciate some help on what I'm missing.</p>
