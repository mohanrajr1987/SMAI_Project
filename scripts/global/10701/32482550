<p>I run the following command in my PS script:</p>  <pre><code>$apiResult = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $myURL -Body $body -DisableKeepAlive -Headers $headers -Method Post -TimeoutSec 120 -ContentType $contentType -UseBasicParsing </code></pre>  <p>This fails on the following error:</p>  <pre><code>Unable to cast object of type \u0027System.Management.Automation.PSObject\u0027 to type \u0027System.String\u0027 </code></pre>  <p>Here is the catch:</p>  <ul> <li>The types of the supplied variables are System.String (for $body, $myURL, $contentType) and System.Collection.Hashtable (for $headers)</li> <li>This fails without calling the actual service behind the URL (verified in service logs)</li> <li>Running this script with the same parameters on the machine with Powershell version 4 does not create this error and actually returns expected result</li> </ul>  <p>I believe this is a bug but i have not been able to find any mention of it on google or any other areas including documentation.</p>
