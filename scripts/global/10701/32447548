<p>I am using .NETCF 3.5 to write an app talking to server (Apache 2.2).</p>  <p>Here is my <strong>GetWebRequest</strong></p>  <pre><code>protected override WebRequest GetWebRequest(Uri uri) {     HttpWebRequest req = (HttpWebRequest)base.GetWebRequest(uri);      byte[] credentialBuffer = new UTF8Encoding().GetBytes(Settings.Get("usr") + ":" + Settings.Get("pwd"));     req.Headers.Add("Authorization", "Basic " + Convert.ToBase64String(credentialBuffer));     req.AutomaticDecompression = DecompressionMethods.GZip | DecompressionMethods.Deflate; //db*     req.UserAgent = "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:24.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/24.0"; //db*      return req; } </code></pre>  <p>And this seemed to work fine but I found following:</p>  <ol> <li><p>If I use <strong>AutomaticDecompression</strong> to retrieve very large amount of data (for example, say 16300000 bytes, this is why I am using compression), I get error</p>  <p><strong><em>An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host</em></strong></p></li> <li><p>If I add UserAgent as above, I get instead</p>  <p><strong><em>The operation has timed-out</em></strong></p></li> </ol>  <p>As I am quite new to web services, I am not sure what is happening but I think there is some time-out that could be increased.  From what I read, there could be 2 time outs, one on Apache server, one that could be set in my <strong>GetWebRequest()</strong>.  But I am not sure how to do that nor I am positive this is how it should be done.</p>  <p>What should I do in this case to resolve this?</p>  <p><strong>More info</strong></p>  <p>The application I am working on issues a request to retrieve some data from database.  For example, the large data I am talking about above is data that returns a certain type of resource and all its parts.  Say a car and information about all its parts as SOAP.  Something like:</p>  <pre><code>Car {   Model   Make   Year   ScrewsArray[] {each element in these arrays then have their own properties}   TiresArray[] {each element in these arrays then have their own properties}   OwnersArray[] {each element in these arrays then have their own properties}   etc   etc } </code></pre>  <p>I have limited options and redesigning app is not an option.  Although I am interested in suggestion on that topic too (since I would like to learn), the time/resources are limited, so I am primarily interested if there is some kind of property that I could set that would eliminate the timeout issue.</p>  <p>The <strong>AutomaticDecompression</strong> seemed to be a good one but I am still getting it for large amounts of data.  I tried setting</p>  <pre><code>KeepAlive = false </code></pre>  <p>and that did not change anything.</p>  <p>Much appreciated,</p>
