<p>We have been using HttpWebRequest for our webservice calls and not caring too much about setting the Accept-Encoding in the header. </p>  <p>What we've found is it normally doesn't send 'Accept-Encoding'. However, once a bad response comes back, it sets it to 'Gzip, Deflate' and then stays that way for all subsequent requests. </p>  <p>This is the code-></p>  <pre><code>HttpWebRequest webRequest = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(url); webRequest.Headers.Add("SOAPAction", soapAction); webRequest.ContentType = "text/xml;charset=UTF-8"; webRequest.Accept = "text/xml"; webRequest.Method = "POST"; </code></pre>  <p>We have since added this line as 'Deflate' was causing issues.</p>  <pre><code>webRequest.AutomaticDecompression = DecompressionMethods.None | DecompressionMethods.GZip; </code></pre>  <p>What I wanted to understand is... what, why and when does it know to set the Accept-Encoding in the header? And once it's set, it seems it's a global setting that stays there until we restart the service that runs the code.</p>  <p>And is there a way to remove it in the code after we're done calling the web service?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
