<p>I have exported my private key to a pfx file and I am using it to post some data to a server. When the code hits this line</p>  <pre><code>X509Certificate2 cert = new X509Certificate2("C:\\mycerts\\dml.pfx","Passw0rd"); </code></pre>  <p>A prompt comes up and ask me to define a password. I write a new password 2 times. Then when I reach this line</p>  <pre><code>Stream newStream = request.GetRequestStream(); </code></pre>  <p>It prompts me again and I put in the newly defined password and the post is successfull.</p>  <p>Is there a way I can avoid user interaction?</p>
