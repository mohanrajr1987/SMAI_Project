<p>Good day,</p>  <p>Lately I've been getting this error while running my code, every time it refreshes the page. Most of the time it works, sometimes I get this kind of error although it works. So I've been wondering how am I supposed to run the page consistently without getting this error.<br><br> How my page works:<br><br> I fetch string in a site were it creates datatable and compare whether there's a new data. So in short, It always refresh the page which where the error occurs.</p>  <p>Here's my code(i don't think the problem lies within the code but feel free to make some suggestions)</p>  <pre><code>  urlStr = "http://SAMPLE SITE"         Dim oRequest As HttpWebRequest = CType(WebRequest.Create(urlStr), HttpWebRequest)          oRequest.Headers.Add("email_id", "SAMPLE EMAIL ID")         oRequest.Method = "GET"         oRequest.ContentType = "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"         oRequest.GetResponse()         Dim str As New System.IO.StreamReader(oRequest.GetResponse().GetResponseStream()) </code></pre>  <p>Any help is appreciated, Thanks</p>
