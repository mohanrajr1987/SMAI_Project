<p>I have browsed through all questions in stackoverflow but I still cannot make my request working. The server (I have no access to it, so I do not know what is going on over there) is always responding with 403.</p>  <p>I was told that I have to use Basic Auth with HTTPS. At first I tried it with PostMan (Chrome add-on) and it worked perfectly. Fiddler says that PostMan has sent this request:</p>  <pre><code>GET https://mypage.com/api/topic HTTP/1.1 Host: mypage.com Connection: keep-alive Authorization: Basic asdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdf Cache-Control: no-cache User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/45.0.2454.99 Safari/537.36 Postman-Token: 7363b868-cc6e-1dff-d5d0-c7a0c1924fa7 Accept: */* Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, sdch Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8 Cookie: JSESSIONID=imxY132456123Scai90Nrsv </code></pre>  <p>I wanted to reproduce this in our C# application, but whatever I try I get a 403 answer from the server. This is (one) of the versions in C# I have tried:</p>  <pre><code>NetworkCredential nc = new NetworkCredential(Login, Password); CredentialCache cc = new CredentialCache(); cc.Add("mypage.com", 443, "Basic", nc);  WebRequest request = WebRequest.Create("https://mypage.com/api/topic"); request.Credentials = cc; request.PreAuthenticate = true; request.Method = "GET"; WebResponse response = request.GetResponse(); </code></pre>  <p>That is what is sent according to Fiddler:</p>  <pre><code>GET https://mypage.com/api/topic HTTP/1.1 Host: mypage.com Connection: Keep-Alive </code></pre>  <p>Obviously there are some things missing. I am wondering which ones (like user-agent?) are really essential and I hope you can help me fix the problem.</p>
