<p>I need to load a webpage, but I need the redirects to work (there can be some redirects using JavaScript instead of just proper HTML 3xx code). I can't make it work. I don't even need to load the content - I just have to make a hit there, so the server can count the page was loaded.</p>  <p>I've already tried WebClient:</p>  <pre><code>WebClient wc = new WebClient(); wc.Headers[HttpRequestHeader.UserAgent] = "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows Phone; Trident/6.0; IEMobile/10.0)"; wc.DownloadStringAsync(new Uri(myUrl), wc); </code></pre>  <p>as well as HttpWebRequest:</p>  <pre><code>HttpWebRequest request =(HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(myUrl); request.Method = "POST"; request.AllowAutoRedirect = true; request.BeginGetResponse(null, null);  </code></pre>  <p>but both of them get only to first page.</p>  <p>I also tried using "hiden" WebBrowser:</p>  <pre><code>WebBrowser wb = new WebBrowser(); wb.Visibility = Visibility.Collapsed; wb.IsScriptEnabled = true; wb.Navigate(myUri); </code></pre>  <p>but it doesn't even get to the first page.</p>
