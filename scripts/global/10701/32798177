<p>I have been working on this for about a day and i can't get JMC to log me in via httpwebrequests. And i'm using this code but it's not working, it just brings me back to the home page:</p>  <pre><code> Dim postData As String = "ddl_schoolyear=2015&amp;ddl_buildings=E&amp;txt_username=txt_passworLogin_Button1.x=0&amp;Login_Button1.y=0"     Dim tempCookies As New CookieContainer     Dim encoding As New UTF8Encoding     Dim byteData As Byte() = encoding.GetBytes(postData)      Dim postr As HttpWebRequest = DirectCast(WebRequest.Create("http.aspx"), HttpWebRequest)     postr.Method = "POST"     postr.KeepAlive = True     postr.CookieContainer = logcook      postr.ContentType = "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"     postr.Referer = "https://eastunioncsd.onlinejmc.com/Teacher/Login.aspx"     postr.UserAgent = "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/45.0.2454.99 Safari/537.36"     postr.ContentLength = byteData.Length      Dim postrs As Stream = postr.GetRequestStream     postrs.Write(byteData, 0, byteData.Length)     postrs.Close()      Dim postre As HttpWebResponse     postre = DirectCast(postr.GetResponse(), HttpWebResponse)     tempCookies.Add(postre.Cookies)     logcook = logcook      Dim postreader As New StreamReader(postre.GetResponseStream())     Dim thepage As String = postreader.ReadToEnd     RichTextBox1.Text = thepage </code></pre>  <p>Is there any solution anything i'm doing wrong? How can i populate the form data with the username and password, where it will log me in with a webrequest. If all information was right i'm suppose to be redirected to "https:/Teacher/Default.aspx".  I would think it would bring me to the dashboard but instead it just goes to the login page. Any help is appreciated.</p>
