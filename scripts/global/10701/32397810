<p>I'm using <code>HttpWebRequest</code>'s <code>BeginWrite()</code> and <code>EndWrite()</code> to perform async writing to the web request. Though I can specify the number of bytes to be written in <code>BeginWrite()</code> call, the documentation suggests that this is the <em>maximum number of bytes</em> that will be written. How can I find the actual number of bytes that were written when I call <code>EndWrite()</code>?</p>
