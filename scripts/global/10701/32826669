<p>I'm making a <code>HttpWebRequest</code> to a server. This is in JSON. Now, the response is encoded and looks like this: </p>  <pre>�\b\0\0\0\0\0\0��A� @ѻ�U�0l�u�\v�v�...</pre>  <p>I can see that my request succeeded in Fiddler. And I can see the response of the server is the right one. But, also in fiddler it requires me to decode the answer first. </p>  <p>I have no idea how to decode this in C#. </p>
