<p>I am making an HTTP POST method to get data. I have an idea to create a method to get a specific arguments but when I don't have idea to get the arguments taken. In HTTP GET, arguments are in the URL and is more easy to get the arguments. How do I create a method to take all the data in HTTP Post? In PHP for example when you show the var $_POST you show all data in the body post. How can I do this in C#?</p>  <p>My method is this:</p>  <pre><code>[HttpPost] [AllowAnonymous] public IHttpActionResult Test() { // Get URL Args for example is  var args = Request.RequestUri.Query; // But if the arguments are in the body i don't have idea. } </code></pre>
