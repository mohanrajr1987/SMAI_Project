<p>Scenario -  When I go to URL 1 in my browser, it authenticates me based on the querystrings and redirects me to a page where I can see the information I want. I can see that upon going to URL 1 and being authenticated there about 6-7 cookies that get added to my browser. Once I have been redirected, I open a different URL - URL 2 and it opens without an issue.</p>  <p>If I try to do the same using HttpWebRequest or WebBrowser in C#, I never receive the cookies from the first request - I have a feeling this is because I am not waiting for the response to end before moving on to making a request to URL 2.</p>  <p>I think what I need to do is</p>  <ol> <li>Make a request to URL 1</li> <li>Wait for the response and redirect</li> <li>Now I SHOULD have access to cookies to put in a cookie container to go off to page 2</li> <li>page 2 should open up to give me the info I need instead of returning 401</li> </ol>
