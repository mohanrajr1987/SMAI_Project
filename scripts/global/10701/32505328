<p>I'm using C# to get data from endless http-stream. I used TCP Client before, but now I want to add status code exceptions, it's much easier to do it with HttpWebResponse. I got response, but problem is I can't read chunks coming from server. Everything looks fine, but I must be missed something. Debug shows execution is stucked at <strong>ReadLine()</strong>. Also I can see there's some data in stream buffer.</p>  <pre><code>HttpWebRequest req = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create("http://" + url + "/stream/" + from + "?token=" + token); using(HttpWebResponse res = (HttpWebResponse)req.GetResponse()) using(StreamReader streadReader = new StreamReader(res.GetResponseStream(),Encoding.UTF8)){     //Start parsing cycle     while(!streadReader.EndOfStream &amp;&amp; !worker.CancellationPending) {         string resultLine = streadReader.ReadLine();         System.Diagnostics.Trace.WriteLine(resultLine);         if(!resultLine.StartsWith("{")) continue;         newQuote quote = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;newQuote&gt;(resultLine);         worker.ReportProgress(0, quote);     } } </code></pre>
