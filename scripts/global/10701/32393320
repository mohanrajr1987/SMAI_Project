<p>How many milliseconds does httpWebRequest need to check a url?</p>  <pre><code>Dim request As WebRequest = WebRequest.Create(URL) request.Timeout = 200 Dim response As WebResponse = request.GetResponse() </code></pre>  <p>As you can see in the code, I just give 200, but sometimes it is not enough for some urls. if I give 2000 it is able to check any url (I think), but it is too long. I want to know how long it takes.</p>
