<p>So I have a program (a game but the question in c++ question) which has a Character class.  This is simplified code of the classes/methods in question</p>  <p>eg</p>  <p>BaseCharacter.h</p>  <pre><code>class BaseCharacter {     BaseCharacter();     ~BaseCharacter();      Weapon* m_currentWeapon;     DoubleLinkedList&lt;Weapon*&gt; m_weaponsHeld; } </code></pre>  <p>BaseCharacter.cpp</p>  <pre><code>BaseCharacter::BaseCharacter() {     m_currentWeapon = new Weapon();     m_weaponsHeld.Insert(m_currentWeapon); } BaseCharacter::~BaseCharacter() {     m_weaponsHeld.Clear(); } </code></pre>  <p>The idea of this class is that every character starts with one starting weapon (which is added to the list of weapons) and also can hold mulitple weapons (which when created are stored through the List)</p>  <p>The List functions for Insert and Clear are like this</p>  <pre><code>template &lt;class C&gt; inline void DoubleLinkedList&lt;C&gt;::Insert(const C &amp;Data) {     LinkedListNode&lt;C&gt;* node = new LinkedListNode&lt;C&gt;(Data);      if(m_tail)     {         m_tail-&gt;SetNext(node);         node-&gt;SetPrevious(m_tail);         m_tail = node;     }     else     {         m_head = node;         m_tail = node;     }   listSize++; }   template &lt;class C&gt; inline void DoubleLinkedList&lt;C&gt;::Clear() {     LinkedListNode&lt;C&gt;* entry = m_head;      while (entry)     {         LinkedListNode&lt;C&gt;* release = entry;         entry = entry-&gt;GetNext();         delete release;     }      listSize = 0;     m_head = 0;     m_tail = 0; } </code></pre>  <p>The issue I am having is that when the BaseCharacters class is deleted, the destructor is called and a memory leak occurs.</p>  <p>I don't really understand (well I have a small idea - think I am deleting a pointer to a pointer when I clear the list rather than the object stored in the list) why the Weapon classes destructor isn't called when the lists Clear() function is called in the BaseCharacters destructor.</p>  <p>Can someone show me the logic error in cleaning up the list and weapons of the character?</p>
