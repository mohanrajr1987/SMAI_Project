<p>Is there such data structure:</p>  <ol> <li>There is slow list data structure such <code>linked list</code> or <code>data saved on disk</code>.</li> <li>There is relatively small array of pointers to some of the elements in the "slow list", hopefully evenly distributed.</li> </ol>  <p>Then when you do search, you first check the array and then perform the normal search (linked list search or binary search in case of disk data).</p>  <p>This looks very similar to <code>jump search</code>, <code>sample search</code> and to <code>skip lists</code>, but I think is different algorithm. </p>  <p>Please note I am giving example with <code>link list</code> or file on disk, because they are slow structures.</p>
