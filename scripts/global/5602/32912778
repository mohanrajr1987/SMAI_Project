<p>I have created a class called 'Function' and want to create a LinkedList in it. So I have written the following code (Cropped to the problem area only).</p>  <pre><code>import java.util.LinkedList; import java.util.ArrayList;  class Function{      ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; arrayList = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();      LinkedList&lt;Integer&gt; linkedList = new LinkedList&lt;Integer&gt;();     protected void addbeg(){       } } </code></pre>  <p>In the import LinkedList line, I am getting the following error: "The <code>import java.util.LinkedList</code> conflicts with a type defined in the same file"</p>  <p>and In the line where I declaring a variable linkedList of type Linked list <code>LinkedList&lt;Integer&gt; linkedlist = new LinkedList&lt;Integer&gt;()</code>, it is giving the follwoing error 'The type LinkedList is not generic; it cannot be parameterized with arguments '</p>  <p>Any help how to eliminate these error? I have seen some tutorial on Java LinkedList where they have written same code without getting any error. I should also mention that The ArrayList is running without any error.</p>
