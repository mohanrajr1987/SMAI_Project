Anyway I would like someone to help me on this. I need to find if the emails, sending one and recieving one have been trading the var opiniao, x times, i have already a scanf to a x var. I need all the guys that for instance when x==3, they gave 3 opinions to someone and that someone also gave 3 opinions to them. Thank you for you time kind sirs and ladies.</p>
