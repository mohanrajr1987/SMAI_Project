<p>I have been tasked with implementing an insert function which will be used in a project. If user input is 1 2 3 4, the desired output of the print statement would be 1, 2, 3, 4. Currently, my print statement is returning 4, 3, 2, 1 but I believe this to be correct. I think my issues lie within my input function (which is nested within a while loop to get user input). This is using C </p>  <p>Any help would be appreciated. </p>  <pre><code>struct set {  int    data;  struct set* next_p;  };  struct set* getInput( struct set* head_p, int val ) {      struct set* temp;      temp-&gt;data   = val;     temp-&gt;next_p = head_p;      return temp;  } /* getInput */  struct set* makeSet( struct set* head_p ) {      int val;      printf( "Please enter a positive integer, or a negative to stop: \n" );      scanf("%d", &amp;val);      while ( 100 ) {          head_p = getInput( head_p, val );         scanf("%d", &amp;val);      }  return head_p;  } </code></pre>
