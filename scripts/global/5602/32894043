<p>I believe that I have a pretty amatuer question here, I've been wracking my brain over linked lists for the past few days (end goal is building a multilist), but right now I'm working with my "addNode" function and I am trying to figure out how to allow the user to input the data point rather than hard coding the point into the program. My addNode function looks as such:</p>  <pre><code>void List::AddNode(int addData) {     nodePtr n = new node;     n-&gt;classpointer = NULL;     n-&gt;class_number = addData;      cout &lt;&lt; "What value would you like to add?" &lt;&lt; endl;      //I believe that right here is where I need to figure out      //how to allow the user to add what they want the data point to be.      if(head != NULL) {         curr = head;         while (curr-&gt;classpointer != NULL) {             curr = curr-&gt;classpointer;         }         curr-&gt;classpointer = n;     }     else {         head = n;     } } </code></pre>  <p>All in all I'm looking for some guidance on how to allow the user to input this data point. If you need to see more of the code that I have please just let me know, thanks all in advance.</p>
