<p>I have been reading this code from one of my class. And got really confused on one of the variables in the destructor. Here is the code, BTW, this is a linked list header file. And the variable I think is not defined but used is the n;</p>  <pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;  using namespace std;   class LinkedList { private:    struct node   {      int info;      node * next;   };    typedef node * nodeptr;    nodeptr start;    int count;   public:         // Constructor     LinkedList()    {       start = NULL;       count = 0;    }         // Destructor     ~LinkedList()    {       nodeptr p = start, n;        while (p != NULL)       {          n = p;          p = p-&gt;next;          delete n;       }    } </code></pre>  <p>The first time this n showed up is from the line<br> nodeptr p = start, n; So please teach me why is it legal to use a variable like this. Any commands is appreciated.</p>  <p>Thank you </p>
