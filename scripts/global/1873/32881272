<p>On my index page, I have a background image which is added to the div dynamically by some javascript.The inline style added is the following.</p>  <pre><code>element.style { background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)     url("http://www.myshop.com/wp-content/themes/mytheme/images/media/bg-footer.jpg")  no-repeat scroll 50% -287.5px; } </code></pre>  <p>I have changed that background image using the following class</p>  <pre><code>.footer-bg{ background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)  url("http://www.myshop.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/blue-living-room.jpg")  no-repeat scroll 50% -59.5px !important; margin-top: 20px; } </code></pre>  <p>I have used <code>!important</code> for overriding the background style loaded by the javascript and it worked.After changing this site is bit slower than earlier.My doubt here is that Will the site load both style or will it completely ignore the first one? </p>  <p>If the site loads both styles and apply the one with <code>!important</code> then it needs some loading time right?</p>  <p>Do these style overriding directly affects site loading speed.Please guide me.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
