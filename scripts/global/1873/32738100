I get the data from a stored procedure and I get it in JSON format. I generate the col model from the code behind depending on certain condition for all other pages I have in my application which use JQGrid. Only in this page I have the requirement of loading the grid in the above format. For certain rows and only for the second column (certain columns) I need to give the user the ability to input alias or "Edited Name" where I find duplication in database. Now since we set the colstyle and not row style how can I achieve this. I use Asp.net.</p>
