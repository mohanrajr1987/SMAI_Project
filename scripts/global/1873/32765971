<p>I have a wpf application with a RichTextBox. When I copy-paste some text from outlook to RTE the list structure is broken. For example:</p>  <pre><code>Dear Test,  Its nice to meet you. Do these following things:   1. test1  2. test2  Thanks </code></pre>  <p>If I copy-paste the above text from outlook to my wpf RichTextBox it looks like this: </p>  <pre><code>Dear Test,  Its nice to meet you. Do these following things:   1. test1  1. test2  Thanks </code></pre>  <p>Here's the <a href="http://pastebin.com/f8ed4pq3" rel="nofollow">html</a> for the outlook I have tried to paste. i feel like mso-list:Ignore has something to do with it.</p>  <p>How can I keep the list number correct when I copy-paste from outlook?</p>
