<p>I have a react component that is a form with various fields, I want to be able to hide various fields by passing in props. Id have a prop called hideElements, which contained a list of ids which would match to the refs of the form elements.</p>  <p>If I use jquery to get each element by its ref and add a "hidden" class in componentDidMount will it cause problems with react? Is there a better way to do it? </p>
