<p>Is there a way to adjust the thickness of the scrollbars of a WebView using the stylesheet used by the whole JavaFX application?</p>  <p>I am a bit confused since</p>  <ul> <li>on the one hand I read that the scrollbars are not part of the JavaFX UI control and therefore can only be customized by a stylesheet set on the web engine (webview.getEngine().setUserStyleSheetLocation(..)) which means I have to write another CSS trying that the scrollbars look like all other scrollbars in the application</li> <li>and on the other hand I can see that the scrollbars are obviously correctly customized using the JavaFX CSS except the thickness of the scrollbars (and that the vertical scrollbar is always shown even if the loaded page requires no scrollbars at all)</li> </ul>  <p>So where am I wrong and which is the correct way to solve this problem?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
