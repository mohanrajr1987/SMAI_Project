<p>I was looking to implement an in app search screen and by searching a bit I found <a href="https://www.google.com/design/spec/patterns/search.html" rel="nofollow">this google material design link</a> with a sexy search box</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/VZyDN.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/VZyDN.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>The app AirBnb has a very similar style (if not the same)</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/WKuyL.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/WKuyL.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>But I cannot figure out how they manage to style that searchView like this.. (especially aibnb with that padding around the search view)</p>  <p>Mine looks like this.. <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/N2zpi.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/N2zpi.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Could someone point to some material to arrive such a design?</p>  <p>Thank you!</p>
