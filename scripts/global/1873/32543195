<p>I want to cusomize <strong>QToolButton</strong> class so it won't show arrow subcontrol when button has a context menu. But I need to apply this style sheet only for buttons with <strong>QToolButton::MenuButtonPopup</strong> popup mode. How to do it properly? I have tried the following sheet:    </p>  <p><code>QToolButton[popupMode != "1"]::menu-indicator {image: none}</code>    </p>  <p>but it doesn't work.</p>
