<p>Using Jupyther Notebooks i often find myself repeadily writing the following to change the alpha value of the plots:</p>  <pre><code>plot(x,y1, alpha=.6) plot(x,y2, alpha=.6) ... </code></pre>  <p>I was hoping to find a matching value in the rcParameters to change to option globally like:</p>  <pre><code>plt.rcParams['lines.alpha'] = 0.6 #not working </code></pre>  <p>What is a possible workaround to change the alpha value for all plots?</p>
