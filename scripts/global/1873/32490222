<p>Android's text selection contextual actionbar has inherited some style from my app that makes it look funny.  I want to remove this styling and use the default.  How can I achieve this?  Preferably in xml rather than programmatically.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/fjxRa.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/fjxRa.png" alt="I want to revert to the default styling of this text selection contextual actionbar"></a></p>
