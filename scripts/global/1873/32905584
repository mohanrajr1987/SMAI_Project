<p>I a bloody nood regarding LaTeX and in the process of writing my bachelor thesis with it. However, my University has a citation standard, which i cannot achieve at the moment. Following styles are used:</p>  <p><code>\usepackage{cite}</code> <code>\usepackage[round]{natbib}</code> <code>\bibliographystyle{ecta1}</code></p>  <p>Now if I want to make a corresponding reference (not a one to one citation) I normally use the following command (Shleifer 1993  as example):</p>  <p><code>\citep{Shleifer1993}</code></p>  <p>This shows up like this in the text:</p>  <p>(Shleifer, 1993)</p>  <p>What i would want is that it shows up like this:</p>  <p>(Shleifer (1993))</p>  <p>How do i do that? Thanks for an answer! Kind Regards, Se√Øt</p>
