<p>I have the code below to add the scripts to a content page controlled by a layout page, it works. However i'm looking to do the same for css styles. I've searched, but to no avail. What I got was the "@section style" syntax which didn't work. I've seen it in mvc, but i'm not sure if it works in webpages. Can someone please let me know how this could be archived...if possible. Thanks in advance!</p>  <p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false"> <div class="snippet-code"> <pre class="snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override"><code>@section Scripts {     &lt;script src="~/Scripts/jquery.validate.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;     &lt;script src="~/Scripts/jquery.validate.unobtrusive.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; }</code></pre> </div> </div> </p>
