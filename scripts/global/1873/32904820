<p>I have problem with getting inline css style properties.</p>  <p>I'd tried doing that with:</p>  <pre><code> var inline_css = $(this).attr("style"); </code></pre>  <p>but...</p>  <p>it works only when element does not have any other css properties outside inline style... like:</p>  <pre><code>.our_element {something: some;} </code></pre>  <p>Any ideas how to get only inline CSS properties from element which has many other CSS properties?</p>
