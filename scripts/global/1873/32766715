<p>I created a custom element and I take html from its <code>&lt;content&gt;</code> and on <code>created</code> I use <code>Polymer.dom(this.root).appendChild(paperItem)</code> (<code>paperItem</code> was created via iteration on HTML I'd received from <code>&lt;content&gt;</code>) to insert that into local DOM. Well, I can't style <code>&lt;paper-item&gt;</code> from template's <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag no matter what I do. Even <code>Polymer.updateStyles();</code> doesn't help. What am I getting wrongly?</p>
