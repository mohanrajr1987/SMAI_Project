<p>I've got these two social icons in the footer of this email and I want them to sit side by side (inline). It says they're inline in the inspector, I thought maybe the td area was to narrow so I widened it.. that's not it.. can't seem to figure it out. Tried inline-block too .. Any ideas ???</p>  <p><a href="http://onlyaction.github.io/snfm/2015/09/21/SNFM-0313.html" rel="nofollow">http://onlyaction.github.io/snfm/2015/09/21/SNFM-0313.html</a></p>  <p>--</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
