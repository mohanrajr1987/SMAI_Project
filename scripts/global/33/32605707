<p>Here my problem statement: </p>  <ul> <li>I have a set of strings that match a regular expression. let's say it matches [A-Z][0-9]{3} (i.e. 1 letter and 3 digits). </li> <li>I can have any number of strings between 1 and 30. For example I could have:  <ul> <li>{A123}</li> <li>{A123, B456}</li> <li>{Z789, D752, E147, ..., Q665}</li> <li>...</li> </ul></li> <li>I need to generate an integer (actually I can use 256 bits) that would be unique for any set of strings regardless of the number of elements (although the number of elements could be used to generate the integer)</li> </ul>  <p>What sort of algorithm could I use? </p>  <p>My first idea would be to convert my strings to number and then do operations (I thought of hash functions) on them but I am not sure what formula would be give me could results.</p>  <p>Any suggestion?</p>
