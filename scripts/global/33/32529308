<p>I have a group of numbers like this:</p>  <pre> 11341 11341 11342 11342 11343 11344 11344 ... 50001 50001 50002 ... </pre>  <p>I want to be able to generate a color based on each unique number so that numbers close together have contrasting colors.</p>  <p>The concept: Each of these numbers corresponds to a session id, I want each session to be color coded, but sessions that are close together should not have similar colors.</p>  <p>I've tried the concept written about <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3403826/how-to-dynamically-compute-a-list-of-colors/3403970#3403970">here</a> and it works, except close numbers tend to have similar colors.</p>  <p>Thoughts?</p>
