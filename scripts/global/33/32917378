<p>In C# there are keywords that allow one to mark a parameter as a <code>ref</code>, <code>out</code>, or an ordinary parameter.</p>  <p>Are there any languages that support marking that a parameter being passed in won't be modified by that function?</p>  <p>If the parameter were a list and the function called clear() on the list, then in order for the language to know that the parameter wasn't changing, I guess such a language would also need a way of marking whether or not a method modified an object's internal state.</p>
