<p>I have a set of JSON files containing dictionaries of numeric arrays. Array type can be integer, unsigned integer, float and boolean.</p>  <p>Here is a sample (of course typical file is way larger, with more keys and longer arrays):</p>  <pre><code>{     "distance": [0, 20, 80, 200],     "time": [0.3, 0.468, 0.976, 1.234],     "active": [true, true, false, true] } </code></pre>  <p>The dictionary keys come from a fixed set of possible keys, but not every key is present in every file (for example, some of the files would not contain the "active" key/value pair).</p>  <p>My goal is to store in binary to decrease file size and increase reading speed.</p>  <p>I thought about using TIFF, due to its tag/length/value architecture, but for what I have seen, a proper compliant TIFF would be an overkill I think. So I wonder if there is another well-known tag/length/value format, or a different suitable binary format, or what I should take into consideration if I am to design my own, personal format oriented to this specific data-set.</p>
