<p>This is a less technical question, but I'm currently in two Programming Languages and Operating Systems classes that is really heavy with vocabulary and history. I have outlined all my notes beautifully but are there any specific ways you would recommend I would organize them (i.e. italicize vocab words, are there any important themes etc.)</p>  <p>It's just a LOT of information and I don't know how to take it all in efficiently.</p>
