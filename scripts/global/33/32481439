<p>I've a need for 3D triangle-triangle collision detection using integer math only. Unfortunately, I'm not in a position where I can use 64-bit integers (only 32-bit) and my vertex values can be larger than 24-bit values. This makes overflows a tricky problem -- otherwise I could probably just use fixed point operations.</p>  <p>The good news is I don't need perfect accuracy -- after all, we're using integers. Additionally, it does not need to be continuous collision detection -- the velocities will be zero. But I may have large triangles tested for collision with small triangles, so coarse approximations of normals can lead to gross relative errors.</p>  <p>The triangles themselves are represented as triplets of 32-bit integer vectors.</p>  <p>Is there a way of doing this?</p>
