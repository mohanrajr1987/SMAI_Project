<p>Lets say I have a big file (or just raw storage if that is even possible in any popular operating systems) on disk that I am going to need to operate on. Is there a way to let the operating system know that I would like the entire chunk of data to be eagerly loaded into memory rather than having only a tiny chunk of it initially loaded into memory and page faulting every time I try to access a segment that hasn't been loaded into memory yet? I'm thinking this would be more for memory mapped files, since the operating system probably already does a good job of having things preloaded if you are doing sequential reads. I'm sure it's technically possible to write an operating system that provides the functionality I am looking for, but does it exist in any popular operating systems?  Also, do most operating systems already preload the entire block into memory by default if there is extra RAM available? If operating systems provide this functionality, what programming language support exists for accessing this functionality?</p>
