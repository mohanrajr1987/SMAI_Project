<h3>WARNING: this is NOT an instance of "finding the longest subarray which sums to zero" problem</h3>  <p>I'm wondering if there's any algorithm to find the length of the maximum subsequence (i.e. elements can be contiguous or not) which sums to zero in a sequence, e.g.</p>  <pre><code>S = {1, 4, 6, -1, 2, 8, -2}      ^         ^  ^      ^ maximum length = 4 </code></pre>  <p>I searched for it but I couldn't find any</p>
