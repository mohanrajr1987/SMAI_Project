<p>I want to make a program that goes to a specific URL (www.example/store.com). When it is there it copies CERTAIN (not everything on the page) bits of text to the clipboard and then pastes them into a spread sheet in excel (ideally, but having them on word or any other text based program would be ok )</p>  <p>Is this even possible? And if it is, what language would I use to make it?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
