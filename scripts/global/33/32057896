<p>Consider this code (written in C to demonstrate the problem):</p>  <pre><code>int foo1(int a) {     if(a)          return 33;     return 22; }  int foo2(int a) {     if(a)          return 33;     else          return 22; } </code></pre>  <p>As you can see, <code>foo1(int a)</code> does exactly the same as <code>foo2(int a)</code>. <code>foo1(int a)</code> is shorter, however I get the impression that <code>foo2(int a)</code> is just more logical (that's only my impression). Which one is better? Is it good to use <code>else</code> with <code>if</code> that is the last control statement in function code and its block always executes <code>return</code>?</p>
