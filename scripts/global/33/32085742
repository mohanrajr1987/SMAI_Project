<p>Suppose I want to switch certain pairs of words. Say, for example, I want to switch <em>dogs</em> with <em>cats</em> and <em>mice</em> with <em>rats</em>, so that</p>  <blockquote>   <p>This is my opinion about dogs and cats: I like dogs but I don't like cats. This is my opinion about mice and rats: I'm afraid of mice but I'm not afraid of rats.</p> </blockquote>  <p>becomes</p>  <blockquote>   <p>This is my opinion about cats and dogs: I like cats but I don't like dogs. This is my opinion about rats and mice: I'm afraid of rats but I'm not afraid of mice.</p> </blockquote>  <p>The na—óve approach</p>  <pre><code>text = text.replace("dogs", "cats")            .replace("cats", "dogs")            .replace("mice", "rats")            .replace("rats", "mice") </code></pre>  <p>is problematic since it can perform replacement on the same words multiple times. Either of the above example sentences would become</p>  <blockquote>   <p>This is my opinion about dogs and dogs: I like dogs but I don't like dogs. This is my opinion about mice and mice: I'm afraid of mice but I'm not afraid of mice.</p> </blockquote>  <p>What's the simplest algorithm for replacing string pairs, while preventing something from being replaced multiple times?</p>
