<p>Say I want to ask the user to confirm an action. The action consists of three parts. Each of the three parts can be formatted in one of two ways. In a human-language-specific way, I might do something like this (pseudocode):</p>  <pre><code>res = "" res = "Do you want to %1 at %2, %3 at time %4%5?" % (     "foo" if fooing else "bar", foobar_data,     "expiring" if expiring else "starting", the_time,     ", without foobing" if no_foob else (", foobing at %1" % when_foob)) </code></pre>  <p>Even if I wrap all translatable strings with the translation function (e.g. <code>tr("Do you want to %1 at %2 ...")</code>), this would probably only work for english since other languages are unlikely to have the same syntactic structure.</p>  <p>But if I write out the whole sentences then I get a combinatorial explosion:</p>  <pre><code>if fooing and expiring and no_foob:     res = "Do you want to foo at %1, expiring at time %2, without foobing?" elif fooing and expiring and not no_foob:     res = "Do you want to foo at %1, expiring at time %2, foobing at %3?" elif fooing and not expiring and no_foob:     res = "Do you want to foo at %1, starting at time %2, without foobing?" # etc ... res = res % (foobar_data, the_time, when_foob) # account for sometimes not having when_foob somehow </code></pre>  <p>What's the standard way to deal with this situation?</p>
