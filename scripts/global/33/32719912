<p>I want to make a dynamic string generator that will generate all possible unique strings from a character set with a dynamic length.</p>  <p>I can make this very easily using for loops but then its static and not dynamic length.</p>  <pre><code>// Prints all possible strings with the length of 3  for a in allowedCharacters {     for b in allowedCharacters {         for c in allowedCharacters {             println(a+b+c)         }     } } </code></pre>  <p>But when I want to make this dynamic of length so I can just call <code>generate(length: 5)</code> I get confused.</p>  <p>I found this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3640174/generating-every-character-combination-up-to-a-certain-word-length">Stackoverflow question</a> But the accepted answer generates strings 1-maxLength length and I want maxLength on ever string.</p>
