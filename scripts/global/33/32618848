<p>There is a comment on the question <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32510183/can-the-use-of-c11s-auto-improve-performance">Can the use of C++11's <code>auto</code> improve performance?</a> that scored many votes and suggests “makes it less likely to unintentionally pessimize” as an answer. I've never noticed this term before. I guess it is somehow the opposite of optimization.</p>  <p>Can anyone give a more detailed definition? What does it mean in the context of programming? How would pessimized code look like?</p>
