<p>A friend of mine dropped me this question, I have been thinking about it but I have no clue where to even begin. The question is solvable.</p>  <p>Rules: You can use add, sub, conditionals, jumps and at most two stacks.</p>  <p>If someone has a solution, an explanation would be nice.  </p>  <p>I already know a way to solve without stacks. <code>m1</code> and <code>m2</code> are the two numbers.</p>  <pre><code>count = m1 prod = 0  Branch_equal_zero count,EXIT  LOOP: prod = prod + m2 count = count - 1 Branch_not_equal_zero count,LOOP  EXIT: return prod    halt </code></pre>  <p>EDIT: The program with stacks will be faster than the program above. I cant figure out how it is possible. </p>
