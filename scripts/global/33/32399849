<p>Over the time I've seen many strongly typed languages introduce some kind of type weakness like C# with the object/dynamic type (which I know, it's not exactly like a weak type system but it seems an attempt towards it). Other weakly typed languages are introducing elements to enforce the strong typing (Javascript and PHP have the <code>===</code> and <code>!==</code> operators to override the type promotion on objects)</p>  <p>So my question is: do we have to expect such differences to disappear in future languages?</p>  <p>Does the object "type" paradigm itself is going to be replaced with some yet-to-come concept?</p>  <p>Very OT question on SO I know... </p>
