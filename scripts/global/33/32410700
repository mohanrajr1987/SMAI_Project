<p>This problem appeared in some regional contest for ICPC. </p>  <p>Given n numbers, you have to remove numbers between i to j such that remaining numbers have least average. You can't remove first and last numbers.  </p>  <p>2 &lt;= n &lt;= 10^5</p>  <p>We had a discussion about it, and I am still not able to understand it. Some how this problem can be converted to finding contiguous subarray with maximum sum and then it was solved with binary search in O(nlog n).</p>  <p>I couldn't catch that solution while discussion and now after thinking a lot I am not able to understand that solution.</p>  <p>Link to the original problem in case it's not clear: <a href="http://programmingteam.cc.gatech.edu/contest/Mercer14/problems/6.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://programmingteam.cc.gatech.edu/contest/Mercer14/problems/6.pdf</a></p>
