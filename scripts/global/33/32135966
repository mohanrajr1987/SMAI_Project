<p>I found code in code review which was written by my team member. It contains nested ternary operator. I told him to use if else if there is more than one nesting for readability purpose. We had argue on that.</p>  <p>following is code</p>  <pre><code>ColorEnum color = opacity == Opacity.FIVE? ColorEnum.BLACK :                  opacity == Opacity.TEN? ColorEnum.WHITE :                     opacity == Opacity.FIFTY? ColorEnum.RED :                         opacity == Opacity.TWENTY? ColorEnum.BLUE :                             opacity == Opacity.FIFTEEN? ColorEnum.PURPLE : null; </code></pre>  <p>And this code is changing as new configurations come.</p>  <p>So What is better here? ternary operator or if else?</p>
