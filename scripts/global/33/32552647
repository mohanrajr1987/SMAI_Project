<p>In OpenGL, would there be any use case where I would create a program, attach whatever shaders I want, call any of the pre-link operations like <code>glBindAttribLocation</code>, <code>glBindFragDataLocationâ€‹</code>, <code>glTransformFeedbackVaryings</code>, or <code>glProgramParameter</code>, and then not link it immediately after that? </p>  <p>Is there any reason to keep an unlinked program object around, even if I do link it at some later point?</p>
