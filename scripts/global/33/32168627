<p>I started a coding project, which has expanded in size and I want to use Git for version control. If that matters, the project is combination of web infrastructure written in HTML/CSS/PHP and server infrastructure written in C. </p>  <p>I currently work in the following way: I perform changes in my development directory: <code>/var/www/dev</code>. Once I am satisfied I manually move the changed files to the live directory: <code>/var/www/stable</code>. Both stable and dev are currently the same, but are web-accessible through different domains: foo.com and dev.foo.com</p>  <p>I have learned the basics of Git and I am familiar with the commands, but I can`t figure out how to migrate the project, although reading several questions on Stackoverflow. I want to maintain a dev version accessible at dev.foo.com. Should I do it that way:</p>  <ol> <li>Open /var/www/master and create the repo with: <code>git init</code>, <code>git add .</code> and <code>git commit</code>. </li> <li>Open /var/www/dev and pull the repo with: <code>git pull file:////var/www/stable .</code></li> </ol>  <p>Once that is done, I should be able to work in my dev environment and have branches in the dev repo, but how will I push the changes to the stable version?  Is there a better way to organize that process?</p>
