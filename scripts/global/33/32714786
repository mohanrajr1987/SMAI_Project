<p>If I have a string with a comma-separated list of things and split it at the comma, I get an array:</p>  <pre><code>"A,B,C,D".Split(',') = ["A","B","C","D"] </code></pre>  <p>If I have a string without a comma, it is a single-element array:</p>  <pre><code>"A".Split(',') = ["A"] </code></pre>  <p>But there are two possible definitions what could happen when you try to split an empty string:</p>  <pre><code>"".Split(',') = [""] "".Split(',') = [] </code></pre>  <p>From my limited experience, the latter makes more sense, but I have not seen any language implement it; the common norm is the former. Is this just inherited/legacy behaviour or am I missing the deeper sense behind the first possibility?</p>
