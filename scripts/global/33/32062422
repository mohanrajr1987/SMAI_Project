<p>Given a list of coordinates <code>(x, y)</code> that form up polygons is there a specific algorithm/s that can be used to find the number of separate polygons <em>"not colliding polygons"</em> that these points create?</p>  <p>And if there is no algorithm/s what would be the most efficient way to calculate these separate polygons?</p>  <p>I have tried using SAT but the performance is bad, since i have to create each individual polygon and check it for collision against every other polygon.</p>  <p>To illustrate what i want to ultimately achieve, in the following picture you can see the polygons that i'd like to calculate/find which are in some cases comprised of connecting squares. </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/HBWr4.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/HBWr4.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Also note that i actually start with <code>x, y</code> coordinates for the center of a square and based on a radius i calculate corner points, so i have access to both methods, but mainly opted for the corner points for SAT.</p>  <p><strong>P.S.</strong> i'm doing this in lua, but would happily accept any code samples/solutions in other languages.</p>
