<p>I want to create filter rule in the web.config file for a C# application, to block <a href="http://website.com/folder/Default.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://website.com/folder/Default.aspx</a>,  but allow <a href="http://website.com/folder/Default.aspx?db=Database" rel="nofollow">http://website.com/folder/Default.aspx?db=Database</a>. Basically they don't have "Default.aspx?db=Database" in the URL, then it will either redirect them to a website another website (or Deny access). </p>
