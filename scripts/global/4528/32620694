<p>I am trying to add Nuget Package transformations which I want to create from project file. </p>  <p>I tried few things like creating a content folder and adding it to my project as explained in <a href="https://docs.nuget.org/create/transforming-configuration-files-using-dottransform-files" rel="nofollow">https://docs.nuget.org/create/transforming-configuration-files-using-dottransform-files</a> but was not able to add keys to project config files after package installation.</p>  <p>Workaround it to create a folder structure as explained in the above url. So I created a folders like content for transform files, lib for dlls/assemblies and it is working. But I think that this is more manual process.</p>  <p>Is there a way to create nuget package transformations using project file?</p>
