<p>I just published my local version to a dev server. My local is working perfectly, but the dev has an error:</p>  <pre><code>Could not load file or assembly 'System.Net.Http.Formatting, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35' or one of its dependencies. The located assembly's manifest definition does not match the assembly reference. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131040) </code></pre>  <p>Does anybody know how can I fix it?</p>  <p>I started to use VS 2015, because of nuget version. Now I got some different error in the output box:</p>  <pre><code> No way to resolve conflict between "System.Net.Http.Formatting, Version=5.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35" and "System.Net.Http.Formatting, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35".
