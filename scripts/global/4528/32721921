<p>After some research i've noticed that in order to use woff2 font types with IIS you need to set the following on the web project's web.config in order to avoid getting 404s from the server:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;staticContent&gt;   &lt;remove fileExtension=".woff"/&gt;   &lt;remove fileExtension=".woff2"/&gt;   &lt;mimeMap fileExtension=".woff" mimeType="application/font-woff" /&gt;   &lt;mimeMap fileExtension=".woff2" mimeType="application/font-woff2" /&gt; &lt;/staticContent&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Locally, this seem to work, but when the project is deployed on IIS, I keep getting 404s, what could be the cause of the issue? Thanks</p>
