<p>All,This question may be ignored everyday by us asp.net developer like air. If you think it is dumb, Please don't laugh. Thanks,</p>  <p>We knew the <code>web.config</code> is hosted in every Asp.Net web application. And It's syntax is restricted by the xml and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms255821.aspx" rel="nofollow">DotNetConfig.xsd</a>. The schema will describe what can be allowed in the <code>web.config</code>. </p>  <p>But When we look in a specified <code>web.config</code>. </p>  <pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt; &lt;configuration&gt; .... &lt;/configuration&gt; </code></pre>  <p>We didn't see any place to show this xml is based on the <code>DotNetConfig.xsd</code>.I mean any xml need to be validated should be documented which schema it is from So that It can be validated in the runtime. Is that right ?</p>  <p>How does the validation works ? Could someone please tell me something about it .  Thanks.</p>
