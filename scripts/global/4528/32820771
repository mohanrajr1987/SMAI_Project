<p>I have a website that contains several child ASP.NET applications like this:</p>  <pre><code>+ Website |- web.config +-- App1 | \- web.config +-- App2   \- web.config </code></pre>  <p>Whenever someone modifies the <code>web.config</code> file of the Website, all Apps are restarted and the user sessions are destroyed.</p>  <p>The problem is that App1 for instance is updated rarely, but the Website itself several times a day. Now the users of App1 are complaining about lost sessions.</p>  <p>Is there an easier way than moving the App1 folder out of the Website folder?</p>
