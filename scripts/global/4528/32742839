<p>I have an C#/ASP.NET project which uses some <code>handlers</code> and <code>modules</code> in the <code>system.webServer</code> section of <code>web.config</code> for single-sign-on stuff which are necessary to be used on production server, but are not needed (and not wanted) to be used on localhost (I just get blank screens instead of my project on localhost).</p>  <p>Easy solution is to have two <code>web.config</code> files, but most settings are the same and changes would have to be updated in two <code>web.config</code> files, so I'd prefer to have just one. A workaround would be to comment the corresponding lines in the <code>web.config</code> when developing on localhost and uncomment them when deploying - but that's not really a nice solution.</p>  <p>Similar problem with database which is a different one on localhost.</p>  <p>Is there a simple way for having one <code>web.config</code> and do something like <code>if (!isLocalhost) use handler/module</code> within <code>web.config</code> file? I hoped for something in <code>preCondition</code> or similar parameter of <code>modules</code> and <code>filter</code> settings, but didn't find anything suitable.</p>  <p>What's best practice for this situation?</p>
