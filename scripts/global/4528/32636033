<p>Just can't seem to get this one ...</p>  <p>I have an AWS Beanstalk app running on IIS. The load balancer is configured for SSL and so is the security group.</p>  <p>So, I enter <a href="http://www.example.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.example.org</a> and it works.</p>  <p>I enter <a href="https://www.example.org" rel="nofollow">https://www.example.org</a> and it works too. Running SSL, great!</p>  <p>Now, I want to force SSL, so my understanding from this thread (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19791820/redirect-to-https-through-url-rewrite-in-iis-within-elastic-beanstalks-load-bal">Redirect to https through url rewrite in IIS within elastic beanstalk&#39;s load balancer</a>) is that I configure the health check and add the described rule in the web.config file.</p>  <p>When I enter <a href="http://www.example.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.example.org</a> I should redirect to HTTPS, but it doesn't work for me?</p>  <p>I seem to have two web.config files, one under the Default IIS site and one under my own site (beneath the Default). This entry doesn't seem to work in either place, but bonks completely under the default site.</p>  <p>Any ideas about what I am doing wrong?</p>
