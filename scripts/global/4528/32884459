<p>Here is my situation: I have a setting in app config that is supposed to control whether some  controls are enabled or not.</p>  <p>Here is how im doing it:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;dx:ASPxButton runat="server"  Enabled="&lt;%$ AppSettings: EnableGeoPropertiesEdit %&gt;" /&gt; </code></pre>  <p>and it works. My problem is that i have to apply the same property to this HTML input</p>  <pre><code>&lt;input type="button" runat="server" id="getElevationButton" disabled=?????/&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I have to disable this control and cant find a simple way to do it</p>  <p>The best i could come up with is</p>  <pre><code>&lt;input type="button" runat="server" id="getElevationButton" disabled= "&lt;%= (!bool.Parse(ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["EnableGeoPropertiesEdit"])) %&gt;"/&gt; </code></pre>  <p>but to my surprise that doesnt even compile. I thought about using jquery to get that property from the other controls but i stumble on the part where i would have to negate it.</p>  <p>Any suggestions?</p>
