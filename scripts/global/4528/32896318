<p>I am still a little new to ASP.Net and am beginning to work with cookies. I have a somewhat understanding of them and was wondering something about them. </p>  <p>This is in regards to securing cookies. I have httpOnlyCookies set to true as seen below.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;httpCookies httpOnlyCookies="true"/&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I noticed there was a Cookie.Secure property which I enabled as true. I did research on these two but am having trouble understanding the differences between the two. Can someone provide some direction on this? What would happen if I kept both set to true? What else can I do to secure cookies other than using SSL?</p>  <p>Many Thanks!</p>
