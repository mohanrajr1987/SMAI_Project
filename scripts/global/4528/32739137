<p>I have a solution with multiple projects, two of them being MVC5 web apps.<br> Every time I update <em>any</em> nuget package in <em>any</em> project, the mvc apps' web.config is modified, adding the following: </p>  <pre><code>  &lt;dependentAssembly&gt;     &lt;assemblyIdentity name="System.Runtime" publicKeyToken="b03f5f7f11d50a3a" culture="neutral" /&gt;     &lt;bindingRedirect oldVersion="0.0.0.0-4.0.10.0" newVersion="4.0.10.0" /&gt;   &lt;/dependentAssembly&gt; </code></pre>  <p>This causes runtime error:  </p>  <blockquote>   <p>[BadImageFormatException: Could not load file or assembly   'System.Runtime' or one of its dependencies. Reference assemblies   should not be loaded for execution.  They can only be loaded in the   Reflection-only loader context. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131058)]</p> </blockquote>  <p>If I remove this entry from the web.config, everything works OK, it's just annoying to remember to do it every time.<br> Any ideea why is this happening?</p>
