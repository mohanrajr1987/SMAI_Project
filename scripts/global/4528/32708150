<p>I have this dilemma of having to have different connection strings for the web.config on my local machine and to have a release transformation that would make the production binaries use the machine.config on the web server. </p>  <p>So I have these files in my Visual Studio solution:</p>  <p><code>Web.Config</code> <code>Web.Debug.Config</code> <code>Web.Release.Config</code></p>  <p>In the web.config I have removed and added new connection strings. </p>  <pre><code>&lt;remove name="connstring"&gt; &lt;add name="connstring" ConnectionString="blahblah" /&gt; </code></pre>  <p>What I want to do is to have nothing in final web.config when deployed (by TFS build) to the web server so that my web application would use anything in the machine.config on the server. </p>  <p>How can I do that?</p>
