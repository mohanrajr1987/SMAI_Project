<p>I have multiple domains pointing to one hosting location. I wish to establish one of the domains as my main domain and therefore I wish to perform a 301 redirect to this main domain whenever a user accesses my site from a secondary domain.</p>  <p>For example:</p>  <p>www.example.com</p>  <p>This is my main domain. I want all other domains associated with my site to redirect to here.</p>  <p>If a user comes in on:</p>  <p>www.test.com or www.test.com/anypage etc.</p>  <p>Then I want the user to be redirected to the example version of that page.</p>  <p>How do I do this using the web.Config file of my application? The reason I ask is that usually my web hosting provider has a tool in their back office that allows me to setup this redirect however, our client has opted for a different hosting provider that do not provide such a tool.</p>  <p>I have attempted to do this redirect using the following code but it doesn't seem to work:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;rule name="Canonical Host Name" stopProcessing="true"&gt;   &lt;match url="(.*)" /&gt;   &lt;conditions&gt;     &lt;add input="{HTTP_HOST}" negate="true" pattern="^test\.com$" /&gt;   &lt;/conditions&gt;   &lt;action type="Redirect" url="http://www.example.com/{R:1}}" redirectType="Permanent" /&gt; &lt;/rule&gt; </code></pre>  <p>My application is an Umbraco powered site and so has several system.webServer entries in the web.config file. It may just be the case that I have entered this code in the wrong place but any help here would be greatly appreciated as I am only used to doing 301 redirects in .htaccess files.</p>
