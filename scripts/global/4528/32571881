<p>I have the following connection string in my MVC 5 weApp:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;connectionStrings&gt; &lt;add name="DefaultConnection" connectionString="Data Source=.\SQLEXPRESS;User Instance=True;Initial Catalog=MatWebDB;Integrated Security=True" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" /&gt; </code></pre>  <p></p>  <p>I'm using Entity Framework code-first and Identity 2 for forms authentication.</p>  <p>Evreything seems to work fine: i register a new user and it logs in properly. The problem is that i cannot find the database that was created; in my SQL Server Management Studio there is no "MatWebDB" database created.</p>  <p>What i want to do is to use the same database generated automatically by the Identity 2 authentication, for my own POCO entity objects. And know where is it created.</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
