<p>We have experienced an odd situation which I have not been able to answer it yet. We have recently installed the SSL certificate and we have used the Microsoft URL Rewrite Module and additionally, we have added the following code in the web.config file:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;rules&gt;     &lt;rule name="Force HTTPS" stopProcessing="true"&gt;         &lt;match url="(.*)" ignoreCase="false" /&gt;             &lt;conditions&gt;                 &lt;add input="{HTTPS}" pattern="off" /&gt;             &lt;/conditions&gt;             &lt;action type="Redirect" url="https://www.testsite.com/{R:1}" appendQueryString="true" redirectType="Permanent" /&gt;     &lt;/rule&gt; &lt;/rules&gt; </code></pre>  <p></p>  <p>Sounds good so far. We have also the mobile application calls through the server and one of them is to call the generic handler on the server in order to upload an image and it is basically pointing <a href="http://www.testsite.com/GenericHandler.ashx" rel="nofollow">http://www.testsite.com/GenericHandler.ashx</a> As you can see that the mobile is calling the http of it.</p>  <p>Inside the handler, there is a code which checks whether there is a directory on the server, if so, then it gets the image and uploads into the folder. IF not, then it tries to create the folder on the server and after all, it uploads the image. This part is not working once we try to redirect from http to https.</p>  <p>All works IF we change the url call from http to https on the mobile end as <a href="https://www.testsite.com/GenericHandler.ashx" rel="nofollow">https://www.testsite.com/GenericHandler.ashx</a>.</p>  <p>How can we handle the calls which come through the handler ?</p>  <p>Btw, you may be wondering why cannot we change it right away because the mobile application is on the production so the changes will take time to get on the live.</p>  <p>I hope that I have been clear and I really appreciate your help and time. Thank you</p>
