<p>I have a rule set up like this:</p>  <pre><code>    &lt;rule name="/hoodie" stopProcessing="true"&gt;       &lt;match url="/hoodie" /&gt;       &lt;action type="Redirect" url="/hoodies" redirectType="Permanent" /&gt;     &lt;/rule&gt; </code></pre>  <p>The problem is, that it appears to be trying to redirect <strong>/hoodies</strong> too. How can I get it to match exactly the URL?</p>
