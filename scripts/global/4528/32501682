<p>I am trying to block all access to the admin url for Umbraco (v7.2.8) for security reasons. I have the below in my web.config file, but it does not work. It is blocking all access to that url, even from the specified IP. I am running this locally on my machine from Visual Studio, so I am not sure what IP the site thinks I am coming in on, but I have tried all of them.  Does this web.config look ok?</p>  <pre><code>  &lt;rewrite&gt;   &lt;rules&gt;     &lt;rule name="Restrict URL" enabled="true" stopProcessing="true" &gt;       &lt;match url="^umbraco($|/)"/&gt;       &lt;conditions logicalGrouping="MatchAll"&gt;          &lt;add input="{REMOTE_ADDR}" pattern="^192\.168\.8\.100$" negate="true" /&gt;         &lt;/conditions&gt;       &lt;action type="Redirect" url="/no-access/" /&gt;      &lt;/rule&gt;   &lt;/rules&gt; </code></pre>  <p></p>  <p>Any pointers would be greatly appreciated! I will be deploying this to Azure eventually but wanted to get this working first. Perhaps it's because i'm running it locally?</p>  <p>EDIT:  I have tried the ipSecurity solution but receive the below error. I have installed the IP Security component for IIS. I am running the site from Visual Studio so I am not sure I can test it from here on the express service that VS uses? I have also changed to 'allow' in the following file;</p>  <p>%windir%\system32\inetsrv\config\applicationHost.config</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/cfIUR.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/cfIUR.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
