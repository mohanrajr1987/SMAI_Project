<p>I've recently came across <a href="http://www.deducer.org/pmwiki/index.php?n=Main.PlotBuilder" rel="nofollow">Deducer</a>, it crossed my mind to have a look at it and I progressed to installing the package. After searching through CRAN it occurred to me that there is a number of packages that support <em>Deducer</em>:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/pJ55j.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/pJ55j.png" alt="packs"></a></p>  <p>Instead of running:</p>  <pre><code>install.packages("Deducer") install.packages("DeducerExtras") </code></pre>  <p>I would prefer to run a loop for all the packages that have <em>Deducer</em> string in the name. Hence my question, <em>how can I get list of packages from CRAN where name matches specific string and install them in a loop?</em></p>
