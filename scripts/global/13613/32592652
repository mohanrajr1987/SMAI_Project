<p>I am using R 3.2.2 on a UNIX server (this is installed to my HOME). </p>  <p>Any package that I try to install returns an error message like this:</p>  <pre><code>install.packages('knitr') Warning: unable to access index for repository https://cran.rstudio.com/src/contrib Warning message: package ‘knitr’ is not available (for R version 3.2.2)  </code></pre>  <p>I've also tried downloading the package source and installing manually, but that doesn't work:</p>  <pre><code>install.packages('/home/baker/knitr_1.11.tar.gz',repos= NULL,type='source') ERROR: dependencies ‘evaluate’, ‘digest’, ‘formatR’, ‘highr’, ‘markdown’,     ‘stringr’, ‘yaml’ are not available for package ‘knitr’ * removing ‘/home/baker/R/lib64/R/library/knitr’ Warning message: In install.packages("/home/baker/knitr_1.11.tar.gz", repos = NULL,  :  installation of package ‘/home/baker/knitr_1.11.tar.gz’ had non-zero exit status </code></pre>  <p>This is obviously a super frustrating problem...any ideas? I'm at a total loss.</p>
