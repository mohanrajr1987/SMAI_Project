<p>I have been developping an R package and I have some problems when I try to run the different checks. If I run <code>R CMD build mypkg</code>, I get the following error message:</p>  <pre><code>==&gt; R CMD build bayesmolsep  * checking for file ‘bayesmolsep/DESCRIPTION’ ... OK  ERROR copying to build directory failed cp: writing `/tmp/Rtmpqgoi1E/Rbuild75451271f31c/bayesmolsep/.RData': No space left on device cp: cannot create directory `/tmp/Rtmpqgoi1E/Rbuild75451271f31c/bayesmolsep/.git': No space left on device cp: writing `/tmp/Rtmpqgoi1E/Rbuild75451271f31c/bayesmolsep/README.md': No space left on device cp: writing `/tmp/Rtmpqgoi1E/Rbuild75451271f31c/bayesmolsep/TODO.md': No space left on device cp: writing `/tmp/Rtmpqgoi1E/Rbuild75451271f31c/bayesmolsep/.gitignore': No space left on device cp: cannot create directory `/tmp/Rtmpqgoi1E/Rbuild75451271f31c/bayesmolsep/..Rcheck': No space left on device  Exited with status 1. </code></pre>  <p>First of all, I don't understand why my <code>.git</code> directory isn't ignored, as <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/15325193/2836971">it is supposed to be</a>. Moreover, all the files which <code>R CMD</code> is trying to write/create are in my <code>.Rbuildignore</code>:</p>  <pre><code>^.*\.Rproj$ ^\.Rproj\.user$ ^\.RData$ ^TODO\.md$ ^README\.md$ ^\.gitignore$ ^\.git/ ^\..Rcheck/ </code></pre>  <p>I tried a few things, but two important comments:</p>  <ol> <li>If I remove these files (e.g. <code>.RData</code>, <code>.git/</code>, etc.), I can actually build the source package and check it without problem (using <code>R CMD</code>).</li> <li>This problem is occuring on Linux (<code>x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu (64-bit)</code>); I copied the directory to a Windows machine, ran <code>R CMD build mypkg</code>, and there was no problem. </li> </ol>  <p>Finally, note that the system on which I'm trying to run the build/check routine <strong>does not give me writing rights on <code>tmp</code></strong>. I thought that could be the problem, but again, when I remove the aforementionned files, I can successfully build the source package.</p>  <p>Anyone has an idea about what's happening? </p>  <p>P.S.: If you want to try it out yourself, the package is <a href="https://github.com/GreenwoodLab/bayesmolsep" rel="nofollow">available on Github</a></p>
