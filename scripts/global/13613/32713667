<p>I have a really weird problem.</p>  <p>I have a SSIS package that transfers data from Oracle Source to an OLE DB destination. The transfer works fine. Before the transfer an SQL task should truncate the destination.</p>  <p>When I right-click the task and select "<strong>Execute Task</strong>" it truncates the table successfully.</p>  <p>When I run the whole SSIS package <strong>the truncate task does not work</strong>. I'm using the right database and the right table. What's wrong? When I manually execute the task it works but when the package runs it won't. </p>  <p>I have no idea why its not working. </p>  <p>Hope you can help me.</p>  <p>Greetings pronax</p>
