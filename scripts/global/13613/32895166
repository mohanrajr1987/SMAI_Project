<p>Does anyone have an idea how to open and see the whole script of a package in R ? We can see the manual pdf file of the package using</p>  <p><code>help(package= )</code> </p>  <p>But I mean is there any way to see, for example, what equations have been used in a package? </p>  <p>The reason why I am asking is the package help (pdf file), does not include any equation which they used to compute the final indices. So, I could not rely on the output results for my study area.</p>  <p>Any comment are appreciated.       </p>
