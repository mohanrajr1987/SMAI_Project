<p>I'm using Mac and trying to install the Image package for loading images (example: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3735553/how-do-i-read-an-image-file-using-python">How do I read an image file using Python?</a>).</p>  <p>I'm using anaconda and PyCharm. The python version is 2.7.10.</p>  <p>If I try: <code>pip install Image</code>, it shows:</p>  <pre><code>Requirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): Image in ./lib/python2.7/site-packages Requirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): pillow in ./lib/python2.7/site-packages (from Image) Requirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): django in ./lib/python2.7/site-packages (from Image) </code></pre>  <p>But when I load it, it says "no module named Image".</p>  <p>I tried to install from PyCharm as well, but I cannot find <code>Image</code> from the package search (I can find "image" but seems to be a different one).</p>
