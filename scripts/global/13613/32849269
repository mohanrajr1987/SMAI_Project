<p>The situation is, I am trying to install Netwire using Stack. However, there is a problem in the latest netwire 5.0.1, as reported by dhobbs: <a href="http://hub.darcs.net/ertes/netwire/issue/13" rel="nofollow">http://hub.darcs.net/ertes/netwire/issue/13</a> </p>  <p>Since I don't know when the problem will ever be fixed, I downloaded the repo and made the change myself. However, I don't understand how to install such a locally patched version. <code>stack install</code> does not install that into <code>~/.stack</code>. Does anyone have an idea?</p>  <p><strong>Update</strong></p>  <p>Now I am developing some other libraries using Stack. How do I make another project use that libraries? Hard coding a relative path looks incredibly ugly.</p>
