<p>My rjson package randomly doesn't work.  As in, it works fine sometimes, sometimes it fails to load. Not sure why.</p>  <p>I get this error.</p>  <pre><code>     Error in library("rjson") : there is no package called ‘rjson’ </code></pre>  <p>To try and alleviate this, despite knowing its installed, I added an install line in my script.</p>  <pre><code>   install.packages("rjson", repos="http://cran.rstudio.com/")    library(rjson) </code></pre>  <p>Now I get....</p>  <p>Installing package(s) into ‘C:/Users/Tom/Documents/R/win-library/2.15’ (as ‘lib’ is unspecified) trying URL '<a href="http://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/contrib/2.15/rjson_0.2.13.zip" rel="nofollow">http://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/contrib/2.15/rjson_0.2.13.zip</a>' Content type 'application/zip' length 491848 bytes (480 Kb) opened URL downloaded 480 Kb</p>  <p>package ‘rjson’ successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked Warning: cannot remove prior installation of package ‘rjson’</p>  <p>The downloaded binary packages are in         C:\Users\Tom\AppData\Local\Temp\RtmpiOfTqK\downloaded_packages</p>  <p>In R, when I go to "Packages --> Load" for some reason rjson is NOT there.
