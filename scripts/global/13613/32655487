<p>I want to read from a text file big arrays of integers and assign these arrays as constants in my package. How am I going to do this? I have made a process that reads from the file and the output is the array that I want:</p>  <pre><code>       P1: process        file vec_file: text open read_mode is "mytext";        variable iline: line;        variable data_read: integer;        variable x: integer := 0;        begin            while not endfile (vec_file) loop             readline (vec_file, iline);             read(iline,data_read);             wait until rising_edge(clk);              output(x) &lt;= data_read;             x := x + 1;            end loop;           wait until rising_edge(clk);            wait;       END process P1; </code></pre>  <p>But how am I going to assign this array to my package as a constant?  Instead of the process, should I make a function in the package body? Thanks in advance!</p>
