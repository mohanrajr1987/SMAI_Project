<p>To clarify the question, basically I need to create a python class for interfacing with the smb.config. I already have other classes for interfacing with things like hdparm and other basic computer information, but samba is another beast. I also need to do the same for NFS, but Samba is first.</p>  <p>This may appear vague, but I am seeking overall approaches to solve this problem, the actual full solution is outside the scope of the question as it would be too large. Things I am looking for:</p>  <ol> <li>Reliable pre-existing packages (I am using psutil in my code, is there something similar for samba?)</li> <li>If there are no packages, how should I write my own. Specifically, an example would be great but also a basic explanation of how you think the class should be organized... there are a lot of potential objects in smb.config, how should they be nested?</li> <li>What problems am I likely to face.</li> </ol>  <p>Thanks!</p>
