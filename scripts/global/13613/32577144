<p>I use this statement '$ brew install python' to install Python, and then I type this statement '$ pip install virtualenvwrapper'. It shows:</p>  <pre><code>    -bash: /usr/local/bin/pip: /usr/local/opt/python/bin/python2.7: bad interpreter: No such file or directory </code></pre>  <p>I don't know why. And I type this statement again '$ brew install python', it shows:</p>  <pre><code>    Warning: python-2.7.10_2 already installed, it's just not linked </code></pre>  <p>Why Python is not linked? Does this problem cause the virtualenvwrapper can't be installed? I have uninstalled Python many times. But I still cannot install packages for Python.</p>  <p>Here is my computer information. Mac OS X Yosemite Version 10.10.5, and the Python version I installed through homebrew is 2.7.10. </p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
