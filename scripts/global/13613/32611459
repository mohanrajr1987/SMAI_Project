<p>I try to do some linear algebra calculating in OCaml. And I had installed Lacaml package. Knowing the slap package is more user friendly, I decided to use this package instead of Lacaml. I did install slap package successfully by typing "<code>opam install slap</code>". But when compiling a file by typing "<code>ocamlfind ocamlc -linkpkg -package slap,slap.ppx -short-paths jacobi.ml</code>", the error </p>  <pre><code>"ocamlfind: Package `slap_ppx' not found"  </code></pre>  <p>occurred. I has been trying a lot to deal with it, but can't.  I has tried to make the package by hand. But a problem called </p>  <pre><code>"File "ppx/ppx_slap.ml", line 21, characters 0-15: Error: Unbound module Ast_helper"  </code></pre>  <p>occurred. I had no idea the "Ast_helper" module is in which package.</p>  <p>Above is all descriptions about my problems. If someone had installed the slap, please help me.</p>
