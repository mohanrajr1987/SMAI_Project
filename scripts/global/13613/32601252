<p>I checked for sparkR package in CRAN package list through the following link.</p>  <p><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_date.html" rel="nofollow">https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_date.html</a></p>  <p>This list does not include sparkR, and therefore installing sparkR through <code>install.packages("package_name")</code> cannot be done.</p>  <p>Why isn't sparkR listed in the package list? </p>
