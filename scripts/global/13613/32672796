<p>I included a <code>sqlite3</code> database in a package of mine. the path of the database file is: </p>  <pre><code>db_file="szs.db" </code></pre>  <p>But if I try to access the database from my main application so it creates a new database in the root of the main application instead using the one in the package. How can I fix the path so it will get the database in my package? </p>
