<p>Hi I have a question on Java Package. I have created a package with more than one classes [package name is 'animal' and file name is 'Zoo.java']. I have created another java file which is in another package 'mypackage' and created a file called 'MAIN.java'. I tried accessing members of the 'animal' package from 'MAIN.java' and it is throwing me an error because it cannot access classes of 'animal' package. I know that only classes which are in same package should be accessible each other, or it should make as public. But I can only change one class to public in 'Zoo.java'. So I found one solution that create separate java files for each class in animal package and make it as public. Is there any other method ? My understanding was, we can write all classes in one file and import them from anywhere. Below is my screenshot. <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/qjys6.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/qjys6.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>And one more thing, in java library how they are implemented it? separate source files for each class within a package ?  </p>
