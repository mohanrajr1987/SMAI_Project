<p>Is there a way to import a package twice in the same python session, under the same name, but at different scope, in a multi-threaded environment ?</p>  <p>I would like to import the package, then override some of its functions to change its behavior only when used in specific class.</p>  <p>For instance, is it possible to achieve something like this ?</p>  <pre><code>import mod  class MyClass:    mod = __import__('mod')    def __init__():      mod.function = new_function # override module function    def method():      mod.function() # call new_function  mod.function() # call original function </code></pre>  <p>It might seem weird, but in this case the user deriving the class wouldn't have to change his code to use the improved package.</p>
