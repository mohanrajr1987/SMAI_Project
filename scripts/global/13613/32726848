<p>I'm wondering what the best or commonly used approach is when you publish a javascript package to npm/github. I've just published one that parses and saves xml and csv data to a database. </p>  <p>For this package, I've created some other packages like </p>  <ol> <li>a logger</li> <li>a model creator</li> <li>some Map() prototypes</li> <li>a little "ORM" for mysql</li> </ol>  <p>While the model creator is mainly for the main package itself (only creates models for the xml/csv parsing), the rest could be used in different projects as well. </p>  <p>What's the commonly used approach here? Should I create a different package for all of the different tools and then require them in my package.json file, or should I just include the files in the main project and create a single package for all?</p>  <p>Are there any differences at all?</p>
