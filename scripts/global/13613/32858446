<p>I'm trying to install the <em>dplyr</em> package on my Windows vista machine (through R Studio). I have the latest version of R installed (3.22) and the preview version of R Studio installed. I've had no issues in the past installing packages, however when I try to install this one, I got error:</p>  <pre><code>&gt; install.packages("dplyr") Installing package into ‘C:/Users/user/Documents/R/win-library/3.2’ (as ‘lib’ is unspecified) also installing the dependency ‘BH’  trying URL 'http://cran.stat.sfu.ca/bin/windows/contrib/3.2/BH_1.58.0-1.zip' Content type 'application/zip' length 13846694 bytes (13.2 MB) downloaded 13.2 MB  trying URL 'http://cran.stat.sfu.ca/bin/windows/contrib/3.2/dplyr_0.4.3.zip' Content type 'application/zip' length 2552598 bytes (2.4 MB) downloaded 2.4 MB </code></pre>  <p>I also tried installing the <em>devtools</em> package so that I could install the <em>dplyr</em> package straight from github. However, the devtools package also gave me trouble on installation:</p>  <pre><code>&gt; install.packages("devtools") Installing package into ‘C:/Users/user/Documents/R/win-library/3.2’ (as ‘lib’ is unspecified) also installing the dependencies ‘BH’, ‘brew’, ‘xml2’, ‘httr’, ‘curl’, ‘memoise’, ‘whisker’, ‘jsonlite’, ‘roxygen2’, ‘rversions’, ‘git2r’  trying URL 'http://cran.stat.sfu.ca/bin/windows/contrib/3.2/BH_1.58.0-1.zip' Content type 'application/zip' length 13846694 bytes (13.2 MB) downloaded 13.2 MB  trying URL 'http://cran.stat.sfu.ca/bin/windows/contrib/3.2/brew_1.0-6.zip' Content type 'application/zip' length 104730 bytes (102 KB) downloaded 102 KB  trying URL 'http://cran.stat.sfu.ca/bin/windows/contrib/3.2/xml2_0.1.2.zip' Content type 'application/zip' length 3174710 bytes (3.0 MB) downloaded 3.0 MB  trying URL 'http://cran.stat.sfu.ca/bin/windows/contrib/3.2/httr_1.0.0.zip' Content type 'application/zip' length 382429 bytes (373 KB) downloaded 373 KB  trying URL 'http://cran.stat.sfu.ca/bin/windows/contrib/3.2/curl_0.9.3.zip' Content type 'application/zip' length 4384906 bytes (4.2 MB) downloaded 4.2 MB  trying URL 'http://cran.stat.sfu.ca/bin/windows/contrib/3.2/memoise_0.2.1.zip' Content type 'application/zip' length 16878 bytes (16 KB) downloaded 16 KB  trying URL 'http://cran.stat.sfu.ca/bin/windows/contrib/3.2/whisker_0.3-2.zip' Content type 'application/zip' length 64756 bytes (63 KB) downloaded 63 KB  trying URL 'http://cran.stat.sfu.ca/bin/windows/contrib/3.2/jsonlite_0.9.17.zip' Content type 'application/zip' length 1009755 bytes (986 KB) downloaded 986 KB  trying URL 'http://cran.stat.sfu.ca/bin/windows/contrib/3.2/roxygen2_4.1.1.zip' Content type 'application/zip' length 594453 bytes (580 KB) downloaded 580 KB  trying URL 'http://cran.stat.sfu.ca/bin/windows/contrib/3.2/rversions_1.0.2.zip' Content type 'application/zip' length 16455 bytes (16 KB) downloaded 16 KB  trying URL 'http://cran.stat.sfu.ca/bin/windows/contrib/3.2/git2r_0.11.0.zip' Content type 'application/zip' length 2690457 bytes (2.6 MB) downloaded 2.6 MB  trying URL 'http://cran.stat.sfu.ca/bin/windows/contrib/3.2/devtools_1.9.1.zip' Content type 'application/zip' length 357684 bytes (349 KB) downloaded 349 KB </code></pre>  <p>None of these files ever get written into ‘C:/Users/user/Documents/R/win-library/3.2’.</p>  <p>Other things tried:</p>  <ul> <li>making sure that I have the latest version of R installed</li> <li>opening R Studio in Administrator mode and installing the packages then</li> <li>installing in R commander instead</li> <li>trying a different CRAN mirror</li> </ul>  <p>None of these helped.</p>  <p>Any ideas how to install dplyr?</p>
