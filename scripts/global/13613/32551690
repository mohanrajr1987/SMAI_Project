<p>A Python module is just a <code>.py</code> source file. A Python package is simply a collection of modules.</p>  <p>So why do we need programs such as <code>pip</code> to 'install' Python modules? Why not just download the files, put them in our project's folder and <code>import</code> them?</p>  <p>What exactly does it mean to 'install' a module or a package? And what exactly does <code>pip</code> do?</p>  <p>Are things different on Windows and on Linux?</p>
