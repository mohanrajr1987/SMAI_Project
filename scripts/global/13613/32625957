<p>So I've built a run-time package for my application. That requires some other BPLs like : <code>ADORTL.bpl, BDRTL.bpl, VCL.bpl</code> and so one. Now I want to use this BPL I've created in my main application and I also want to load it at runtime. So everytime a user does an action that require some info from the bpl, i load it, and unload it after there is no need. </p>  <p>In order to use my bpl in the main application I have to compile my app with run-time packages. If I do so when I move the .exe file to an other computer with no Delphi installed it askes for lots of bpls to work. Is there a way I can built with run-time packages and somehow integrate (vcl.bpl,adortl.bpl) in the exe file?</p>  <p>I would like that my main app only to ask for the bpls i've created, not the Delphi IDE bpls. </p>
