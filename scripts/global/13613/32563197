<p>I have this structure: (namespace is java)</p>  <pre><code>package/common.thrift common.thrift fileA.thrift </code></pre>  <p>I want fileA.thrift to include both common.thrift</p>  <pre><code>include ".../package/common.thrift" include "common.thrift"  struct A {    1: common.Something something #From first file (no error)    2: common.SomethingElse else  #This throws error. } </code></pre>  <p>Thrift only reads content from the file specified first  in order. Is there a way for this : <code>common.thrift as common</code>  So that i can differentiate them. Or the only solution is to have different file names</p>
