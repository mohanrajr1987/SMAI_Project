<p>I have created classes under the <code>Company</code> root namespace. Now, I want to add to all classes the <code>Product</code> sub-namespace so that all classes are under the <code>Company.Product</code> root namespace. I use Visual Studio 2015. Is  there anyway to achieve that automatically? I have tried to rename the namespace, but it does not allow include dots in the name. Any ideas? </p>
