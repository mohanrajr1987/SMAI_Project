<p>I want to have a Windows Forms application based on a hotel booking system. It needs to be generic so I want hotel managers to specify things like how many rooms there are in their hotel and adjust the room number box accordingly, whether they want to give guests the option of a ground floor room etc. So that the system is tailored to their hotel.</p>  <p>Could this be done by 'if' statements and a series of pop up boxes for user entry?</p>
