<p>I'm following the tutorial at <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/pythontutorial" rel="nofollow">https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/pythontutorial</a> .</p>  <p>I've managed to create the <code>addressbook_pb2.py</code> from the proto file. I added <code>addressbook_pb2.py</code> to my project, and when I do <code>import addressbook_pb2</code> the .py file pops up as I type the name, so I know the program recognizes it. </p>  <p>When I try to run the program, which consists of only the line <code>import addressbook_pb2</code>, I receive the error <code>No module named 'google'</code>. I am extremely new to Python, how would I go about fixing this error? I am running Python 3.4 in Visual Studio 2013</p>  <p>The error is caused at each <code>importing google.protobuf</code> line in my 'addressbook_pb2.py' file</p>  <pre><code># Generated by the protocol buffer compiler.  DO NOT EDIT! # source: addressbook.proto import sys _b=sys.version_info[0]&lt;3 and (lambda x:x) or (lambda x:x.encode('latin1')) from google.protobuf import descriptor as _descriptor from google.protobuf import message as _message from google.protobuf import reflection as _reflection from google.protobuf import symbol_database as _symbol_database from google.protobuf import descriptor_pb2 </code></pre>
