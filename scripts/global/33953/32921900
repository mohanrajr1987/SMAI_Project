<p>How can I create a Windows Form Application by asking the user questions when the program is run? For example, asking the user what colour background they want, the maximum number that can be entered into a text box, whether they want certain check boxes enabled etc.</p>  <p>It's for a hotel booking/check-in system, so I want the hoteliers to be able to specify if they want to have the option of limiting the room number box to say 100 if they only have 100 rooms. Also having a check box enabled for a twin room or double room etc.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
