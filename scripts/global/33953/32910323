<p>I've trying for days to instal Visual Studio Professional 2015 on Parallels 11, and I always get this same error message part-way through the process:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/30Ofg.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/30Ofg.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I have researched this and there were suggestions about moving the installer to a different location .... Didn't work. I've tried from ISO and from the files themselves. </p>  <p>Parallels 11, OSX Yosemite and El Capitain, Windows 10. I have VS2013 on there which is fine. The same ISO installed fine on my windows box. </p>  <p>Any suggestions very much appreciated.</p>  <p>Thanks, Andy</p>  <p><strong>EDIT: an activity log from the installation is at <a href="http://pastebin.com/D3gz3LVq" rel="nofollow">http://pastebin.com/D3gz3LVq</a></strong>  <em>thanks to @magicandre1981 :)</em>   Possible line of interest at line 146: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>The CTM file is out of date and should be deleted and rebuilt, but the file &apos;C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\VisualStudio\12.0\1033\devenv.CTM&apos; could not be deleted.</p> </blockquote>
