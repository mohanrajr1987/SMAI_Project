<p>I am trying to set up unit testing in a solution with Visual Studio Enterprise 2015 and Resharper Ultimate 2015.2.  </p>  <p>I created a new unit test project in the solution and used NuGet to install Nunit 2.6.4.</p>  <p>Debugging a unit test through Resharper throws an AssertionException.  I expected it to catch the exception and report it.</p>  <p>For example:</p>  <pre><code>[TestFixture] class AssertTest {     [Test]     public void IsTrue()     {         Assert.True(false);     } } </code></pre>  <p>Is there additional configuration that needs to be done to properly integrate Resharper and Nunit?</p>
