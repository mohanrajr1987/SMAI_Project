<p>I have 3 classes:</p>  <pre><code>Class A   Public prop1 As String End Class  Class B Inherits A   Public prop2 As String End Class  Class ABList Inherits List(Of A) End Class  Dim coll = New ABList coll.Add(New A) coll.Add(New B) </code></pre>  <p>Items in object of class ABList can be both A and B. But when I serializing it with JavaScriptSerializer and then deserializing it back, all items inside ABList become of class A. Yes, that because ABList inherits List(Of A). But how can I extend this behaviour to get initial objects of proper classes after deserializing?</p>
