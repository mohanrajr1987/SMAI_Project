<p>I'm trying to make an application in C# that can download, install and manage various games that I and a few friends'll be making.</p>  <p>I know how I'm gonna do it, but I want users to be able to use this app on both Windows and Linux as most games will run on both. That's not the big issue, I know how I'm gonna get that working. Ohhhh, the power of Mono and GTK#.</p>  <p>The issue is, however, that for GUI-designing I can't figure out how to design GTK windows within Visual Studio just like you can with Windows Forms. I don't know if there's an add-in or whateverthelike, I just need some way of designing my GUIs for Linux.</p>  <p>I am running Visual Studio Express 2015, on Windows 10.</p>
