<p>I'm working on a C program in Visual Studio 2013.  All day long I'm tweaking and rebuilding, tweaking and rebuilding, and every so often I'll get a whole string of errors on all my <em>printf</em> statements saying</p>  <pre><code>1   IntelliSense: too few arguments in function call     </code></pre>  <p>All my <em>printf</em>'s are of the form:</p>  <pre><code>printf("sob x = %d\n", sobelXsum); </code></pre>  <p>sobelXsum is an int.</p>  <p>If I close Visual Studio, re-open it in my project the errors go away.   Sometimes they stay gone for hours, sometimes they stay gone for days.  But sooner or later they come back.  Restarting Visual Studio always fixes it.  Is there an actual bug in my code, and if so why does restarting Visual Studio "fix" it? What's causing this and how can I prevent it, or at least reset it without having to restart Visual Studio?</p>
