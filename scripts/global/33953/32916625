<p>I've recently started a Computer Science degree at college, and I'd like to know what improvements I could make to my following code. </p>  <pre><code>Public Class Form1 'setup array Dim firstname(100) As String Dim age(100) As Integer Dim oldName As String Dim oldAge As Integer  Private Sub btnRead_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnRead.Click     Call readFile(firstname, age)     Call findOldest(firstname, age, oldName, oldAge)     Call writeOldest(oldName, oldAge)     End End Sub  Private Sub readFile(ByRef firstname, ByRef age)     'setup temp     Dim counter As Integer = 0     Dim tempfirstname As String = ""     Dim tempage As Integer      'open the file     FileOpen(1, "C:\Alan VB\ages.csv", OpenMode.Input)     Do While Not EOF(1)         Input(1, tempfirstname)         firstname(counter) = tempfirstname         txtNames.AppendText(firstname(counter) &amp; vbCrLf)          Input(1, tempage)         age(counter) = tempage         txtAges.AppendText(age(counter) &amp; vbCrLf)          counter = counter + 1     Loop     FileClose(1) End Sub  Private Sub findOldest(ByVal firstname, ByVal age, ByRef oldName, ByRef oldAge)     oldAge = age(0)     oldName = firstname(0)     Dim counter As Integer = 0     For counter = 1 To age.length - 1         If age(counter) &gt; oldAge Then             oldAge = age(counter)             oldName = firstname(counter)         End If     Next     MsgBox("The oldest person is " &amp; oldName &amp; ", aged " &amp; oldAge) End Sub  Private Sub writeOldest(ByVal oldName, ByVal oldAge)     FileOpen(1, "C:\Alan VB\oldest.txt", OpenMode.Output)     PrintLine(1, "The oldest person is " &amp; oldName &amp; ", aged " &amp; oldAge)     FileClose(1)     MsgBox("Your file has been written successfully.") End Sub </code></pre>  <p>End Class</p>  <p>The program is supposed to:</p>  <ol> <li>read a file</li> <li>display the contents of the file</li> <li>use standard algorithms to find the highest age </li> <li>display the highest age and their name</li> <li>write the highest age and name to a file</li> </ol>  <p>DISCLAIMER: This is my lecturers final code, we were just to copy it essentially. I apologise for the bad variable naming etc. I also have experience with PHP, so I'm not in the dark about what is what. </p>
