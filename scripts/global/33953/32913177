<p>I'm pretty new to xamarin, tried to run a sample application (IOS). But  Visual Studio says: <code>"Please select a valid device before running the application"</code></p>  <p>I know on the IOS toolbar, there should be option to select which device to simulate (list of supported IOS devices like iphone 6, 5s etc), but I don't get that.</p>  <p>EDIT: To be more precise,  TARGET IOS Device not shown on IOS Tool bar</p>
