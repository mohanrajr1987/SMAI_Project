<p>So i am trying to create a small Budget management system with ASP.net but i don't know how to approach one part of this.. So any help would be appreciated... </p>  <p>So what i am trying to do is to make a simple budget management system which can do the following things:</p>  <ul> <li>A Work Table: stores the works the company has taken done.</li> <li>An Income Table: stores how much income has come from the works (Link using Foreign Keys to Work Table) </li> <li>An Expense Table: stores on all kind of expenses (Link using Foreign Key to Work Table if necessary) </li> <li>A Balance Table: Store, the cash on hand which needs to increase if income comes, and decrease if any expense has occurred. </li> </ul>  <p>I need to make the real time/Current Balance to be visible.</p>  <p>So wat i dont know is how to approach the balance table? Should i make a new record to be created each time an income or expense is added? </p>  <p>If possible can anyone explain how to approach this balance thing? also wat kind of coding or formula is required here?</p>
