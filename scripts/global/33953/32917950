<p>I have a Windows 7 machine without CUDA capable graphics card. Primary language I need to use is C++ using Visual Studio.</p>  <p>Is there a way I can run program without graphics card?  My needs are very basic and I just need to run a few programs for my lab work. Nothing major where I have to utilize latest and greatest of toolkit features.</p>  <p>I did read the question <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3087361/gpu-emulator-for-cuda-programming-without-the-hardware">GPU Emulator for CUDA programming without the hardware</a> but not sure if any other emulators available which are windows friendly etc.</p>
