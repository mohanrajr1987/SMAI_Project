<p>I have a VS 2012 C++ project which runs a command (google test project) in the Post-Build step.</p>  <p>Naturally, when this command fails (returns -1), the entire post-build step fails, and the entire build is marked as a failure.</p>  <p>I do not want this.  I don't want the failed command to mark the build as a failure.</p>  <p>I tried tacking an <code>EXIT 0</code> on the end of the Post-Build step, but it still says that the step return -1.</p>  <pre><code>2&gt;C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\Microsoft.Cpp\v4.0\V110\Microsoft.CppCommon.targets(134,5): error MSB3073: The command "IF [%NO_RUN_TESTS%] EQU [] ("D:\code\TestTests\Tests\x64\Release\MyGoogleTests.exe" --gtest_output=xml:MyGoogleTests_gtest.xml) 2&gt;C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\Microsoft.Cpp\v4.0\V110\Microsoft.CppCommon.targets(134,5): error MSB3073: EXIT 0 2&gt;C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\Microsoft.Cpp\v4.0\V110\Microsoft.CppCommon.targets(134,5): error MSB3073: :VCEnd" exited with code -1. </code></pre>  <p>I have discovered that if I swallow both the stdout and stderr from the command using <code>2&gt;nul 1&gt;nul</code>, and do an <code>EXIT 0</code>, it will not mark the build as a failure.  This is not an acceptable solution for me, however -- I still need to see the output from the command.</p>
