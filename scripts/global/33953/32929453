<p>I am very new to Open Street Map. I have some data that need to be shown on a map by Open Street Map from C# VS2013. The application can be WPF or windows forms.</p>  <p>The data is about some statistics results by location.</p>  <p>For example,</p>  <p>location,  latitude, longitude, address, population, household, income of household, tax of household</p>  <p>The data was got from a database by running SQL query from C# code. The data volume may have 1 million rows. I need to do some aggregation so that they can be displayed on the map clearly. For example, aggregate all houshold (located in zip code 10080) information in a circle displayed on the map.</p>  <p>Moreover, I need to provide the following functions the on map so that the users can do:</p>  <p>(1) when zoom in to a location, more detailed data (from zip code to street level) will be shown.</p>  <p>(2) when zoom out, only the aggregated data was shown. For example, from street level to zip code level.</p>  <p>(3) users can get detailed data by selecting any location on the map as long as the location has data to show. For example, if a location in zip code = 10080 was selected, all household information in the selected location can be shown.</p>  <p>(4) users can hold control and click any location so that multiple locations household information can be show.</p>  <p>I have checked OSM wiki website and API, but I still have no idea how to add the data to a OSM map and edit the map to show it clearly.</p>  <p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
