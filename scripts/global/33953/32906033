<p>I am currently migrating a windows 8.1 application to universal windows 8.1 application in windows 8.1 Visual Studio 2015. Project is using windows kit 8.1. but i want to include some headers from windows driver kit 7.1. Is there any way to use WDK 7.1 headers in project just by giving the right path or tell me any other method to include headers from WDK 7.1.</p>  <p>I want atlbase.h header. which is not in the windows kit 8.1. But i found it in WDK7.1 with the help from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/8990680/4600792">here</a>.</p>
