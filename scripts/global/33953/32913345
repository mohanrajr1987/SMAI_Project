<p>I just installed VS 2015 Professional and opened a solution I've been working on. Everything looked fine at first. The solution has a Database project, MVC website, a Unit Test project, some miscellaneous class libraries and a console app.</p>  <p>I have the website selected as the startup project. (Incidentally, the new Startup Projects drop-down next to the Start button doesn't show the website project unless I manually selected it as the startup project from the Solution Explorer. This is a little odd.)</p>  <p>When I press F5 or click the Start button, I'm immediately presented with a Connection Properties dialog for connecting to a database. It's set to [myPC]\SQLEXPRESS by default with "Database" as the database name. What is it prompting me for? </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Y7QpI.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Y7QpI.png" alt="Connection Properties dialog"></a></p>  <p>If I click Cancel, I get a dialog that says "There were build errors". Yet, my solution does not have any build errors if I use the Build Solution button, and there are no entries in the Error List window after this dialog pops up. If I select a database that actually exists in my SQLEXPRESS instance, like Master, and hit OK, it still gives me the build error dialog.</p>  <p>If I right-click the website project in the Solution Explorer and choose Debug > Start new Instance, it runs exactly as expected.</p>  <p>If I set another project as the startup project, it also prompts me for a connection.</p>  <p>In my solution configuration, my database project is not set to deploy on build, so I really have no idea why Visual Studio is asking for a connection.</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: If I remove the Database project from the solution, it no longer prompts me. It only prompts me if I have the database project set to Build in my solution configuration. Even if I choose the actual database server and database that this project targets I get the build error dialog. Yet, if I right click the database project in the Solution Explorer and choose Build, it doesn't prompt me like this.</p>
