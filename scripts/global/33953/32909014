<p>I'm receiving the following error after upgrading Visual Studio 2013 Web Essentials recently:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Less: error evaluating function data-uri: Cannot find module   './types.json'</p> </blockquote>  <p>This is because of the following line of code, but I see no reason why it should all of a sudden start causing an issue:</p>  <pre><code>background-image:data-uri('../images/search.png'); </code></pre>  <p>Why is this happening and how can I resolve it?</p>
