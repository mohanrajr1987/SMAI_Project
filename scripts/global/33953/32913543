<p>I am trying to add an icon to an .NET exe built in the Visual Studio, but somehow it does not work.</p>  <p>Here are steps to reproduce the problem: 1. I created a new Windows Form Application application:  New Project -> Windows Form Application  2. Open the resources in it: Right click on Solution -> Properties -> Resources 3. Tried to add an icon file to it: Icons -> Add Resources -> Add Exising File-> and chose an existing icon.</p>  <p>It appeared that the icon was added. So, I build the exe file and closed the solution, but the resulting exe file did not contain the icon in the Windows resources. I verified that by opening the exe file by Visual Studio. The Visual Studio showed resources to me, which contained the manifest and version, but no icon.</p>  <p>The question: what am I doing wrong? Why does the added icon not appear in the Windows resources?</p>
