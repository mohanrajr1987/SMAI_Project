<p>I am new to JQuery, Trying to understand what can I do to extend the Sortable UI</p>  <p>What I want to achieve is:</p>  <p>I have a list</p>  <pre><code>| A | B | C | . | E | F | G | H | </code></pre>  <p>Where . is consider an empty spot. </p>  <p>If I drag A to B, instead of swapping places that looks like</p>  <pre><code>| B | A | C | . | E | F | G | H | </code></pre>  <ul> <li><p>I want it to look like (A push to B (Original A spot opens), B push to C, C push to Open Spot)</p>  <p>| . | A | B | C | E | F | G | H |</p></li> <li><p>Another example if I push B to C it becomes</p>  <p>| A | . | B | C | E | F | G | H |</p></li> <li><p>Also if I were to push E to F, since to the right of H doesn't have a open slot, there should be alert saying can't move.</p></li> </ul>  <p>Here is what I have done so far, you guys can reuse </p>  <p><a href="https://jsfiddle.net/tw4tzh25/" rel="nofollow">https://jsfiddle.net/tw4tzh25/</a></p>
