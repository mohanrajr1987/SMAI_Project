<p>Is there a list of css classes that I can use in my javascripts?  I mean a complete list with descriptions in one place? For example, I am creating a dialog and I am using</p>  <pre><code>dialogClass: 'no-close warn-dialog' </code></pre>  <p>I know, I can also use</p>  <pre><code>dialogClass: 'alert' </code></pre>  <p>But that I know, just because I saw examples on the web</p>  <p>When I am writing my function, is there a way to know, what classes are available, so to look at and choose what I need?  I do understand, that I can write my own css class, and use - the point is I am looking for a single API resource of what's available in jQuery-ui, or something of sorts.  </p>
