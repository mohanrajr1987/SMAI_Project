<p>In our case, we develop our website using ASP.NET 4.0 c#, </p>  <blockquote>   <p>there's a tree view control on the left part of web page, and document   html on the right part.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Just like MSDN or Java API. </p>  <p>We want to add a <strong>resizable splitter bar</strong> between the tree view control and doc html, so that the width can be changed when user resize it. In addition, <strong>if the page refreshes or user chooses another node on tree view control, the new width is applied.</strong> </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Currently, we use jquery-ui to implement the resizable bar, we made   the right border of tree view control resiable, so that it can work   well with node wrap feature of tree view control. We store the width   of tree view control on cookie, when the page redirects to another doc   html, it can initialize the modified width of tree view control, users   don't have to resize it again.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Our problem occurs reading cookies. <strong>We have two ways to do that, one</strong> is reading cookie from front end, use javascript to read cookie. <strong>We give up this way</strong> because the width of treeview control is 350px setting up in the back end at first, then change to a new width by front end, for example 600px, <strong>this will lead to a short time flash on the page</strong>, which is a bad UX.</p>  <p><strong>Another way</strong> is reading cookie in the back end using c#, we read cookie in the page_load funtion. However, we also have a problem, when the page refreshes (URL doesn't change) or other reasons leading to URL occurs before, the program doesn't go to page_load() funtion or any other page life cycle funtions. FYI, In our program, we need to use </p>  <p><code>&lt;%@ OutputCache CacheProfile="XXXCache"%&gt;</code></p>  <p>, but that will cause the program doesn't go to page_load fuction.</p>  <p>Is there any better idea to help me fix this problem, thank you.</p>
