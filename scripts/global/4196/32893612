<p>I have a grid with elements in it that can be dragged within the grid and clicked to trigger a different event. I'd like the elements to start OUTSIDE of the grid, and then for the user to drag them into the grid (where they are then contained inside the grid and cannot leave...). Kind of like a chess board with pieces that start off the board.</p>  <p>So far, I have it that the elements begin inside the grid and are also contained within the grid. How do I get them to start in the margin right above the grid? </p>  <pre><code>$(".draggable" ).draggable({      drag: function(){         var offset = $(this).offset();         var xPos = offset.left;         var yPos = offset.top;         $(this).children('.itemPos').text("(" +xPos +"," + yPos + ")");     },     containment: "#grid-wrapper", }) </code></pre>  <p>Fiddle here:  <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/gxg6ztew/2/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/gxg6ztew/2/</a></p>
