<p>I'm designing a website as part of my school's Virtual Enterprises class and need some help.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/rOQIC.jpg" rel="nofollow">Picture of Website Catalog for reference</a></p>  <p>Alright, the Order Now button <code>&lt;button type="button" class="order-btn" id="order-btn"&gt;Order Now&lt;/button&gt;</code> is dynamically added when the user clicks on one of the thumbnail images at the top of the site. I would like to have the large image and description/button, <code>og-fullimg</code> and <code>og-details</code> respectively, slide out of the viewport to the left when the user clicks the order button; they are also added dynamically. Here's what I have so far, but it doesn't seem to be working.</p>  <p>JS</p>  <pre><code>$(document).on('click', "#order-btn", function() {     var order = $(this).parent(".og-details").attr("#order-btn");     $("#og-fullimg").hide('slide', {direction: 'left'}, 1000);     $("#og-details").hide('slide', {direction: 'left'}, 1000); }); </code></pre>  <p>I have included JQuery UI. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I've already checked out <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/203198/event-binding-on-dynamically-created-elements">Event Binding on Dynamically Created Elements</a>. Thank you for your help. </p>  <p><strong>Answer</strong></p>  <p>I forgot to add the easing for <code>.hide</code>. The code needed to make <code>og-fullimg</code> and <code>og-details</code> slide out of the viewport and for the order form, <code>order_form</code>, to slide in is below.</p>  <pre><code>$(document).on('click', "#order-btn", function() {     var order = $(this).parent(".og-details").attr("#order-btn");     $("#og-fullimg").hide('slide', 'swing', '5000ms', {direction: 'left'}, 1000);     $("#og-details").hide('slide', 'swing', '5000ms', {direction: 'left'}, 1000);     $("#order_form").toggleClass('hidden'); });  </code></pre>  <p>It took a while, but I figured it out eventually. Thanks to those who offered help.</p>
