<p>I was requested to support two formats in jqueryui date picker. The kind of <em>official</em> one is : <code>yyyy/mm/dd</code> but for easier keyboard direct input I was told to support <code>yyyymmdd</code> format too.</p>  <p>The server expects <code>yyyy/mm/dd</code> so I convert <code>yyyymmdd</code> into <code>yyyy/mm/dd</code> if possible (I am just keeping in simple here in this example). </p>  <pre><code>$('#mypicker').datepicker({         dateFormat: 'yy/mm/dd',         }).on('change', function() {         // Attempt to correct only 8 digits format. (When pasting or typing)         if (/^\d\d\d\d\d\d\d\d$/.test(this.value)) {             this.value = this.value.substring(0,4) + '/' + this.value.substring(4,6) + '/' + this.value.substring(6,8);         }     }); </code></pre>  <p>This works fine in various browsers except in IE. As soon as I select a date in the picker the picker hides but it re-appears again. Does this look like a jqueryui bug? IE bug? My bug? Can I do it in another way so the datepicker stops reappearing?</p>
