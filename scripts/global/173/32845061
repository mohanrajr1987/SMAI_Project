<p>I was able to get rivets to perform as expected during pageload by using       </p>  <pre><code>window.diagHistoryView = rivets.bind($('#diagnosis-history'), {     history: diagnosisList,     controller: controller }); </code></pre>  <p>Now, when a user does anything that might call a postback, this binding is lost.</p>  <p>I've tried </p>  <pre><code>window.diagHistoryView.update ({history : diagnosisList})  </code></pre>  <p>after making sure the diagnosisList was the new information, but no dice.</p>  <p>I did this exact same task in Angular, and i simply add a $compile on the endRequest method of the page request manager.</p>  <p>Anything I can do like this with Rivets?</p>
