<p>I have a DataGrid which is bound to a Hashtable, I would love to filter it, depending on the text entered in the textbox it should search the key of the Hashtable and show the result(entire data row which belongs to it).</p>  <pre><code>//GridView var data = CollectionViewSource.GetDefaultView(wordListView.ItemsSource); //TextBox which contains the search term data.Filter = (wert) =&gt; wert.ToString().Contains(textBoxSearch.Text); </code></pre>  <p>At the moment when I type someting in a textbox it will show nothing, it will remove the entire data in that Gridview.</p>  <p>What to do here ?</p>  <p><strong>Updated</strong> The 'System.Collections.Hashtable' has a key which contains escaped file paths and the value is the file name.</p>
