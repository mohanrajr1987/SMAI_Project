<p>I have a class called <code>DataModel</code> where I am storing all information about my app's state. In there I have a property called <code>DeviceInput</code>, typed as <code>CoreInputDeviceTypes</code>. That is where I am holding the value for whether or not touch is enabled for my <code>InkCanvas</code>. I want to bind my <code>InkCanvas.InkPresenter.InputDeviceTypes</code> property to the <code>DeviceInput</code> property. I have created a <code>Binding</code>:</p>  <pre><code>Binding inputBinding = new Binding(); inputBinding.Source = DataModel.DeviceInput; inputBinding.Mode = BindingMode.OneWay; </code></pre>  <p>The problem is that I can't find any way to set the binding to the <code>InkCanvas.InkPresenter.InputDeviceTypes</code> property. If I try to do:</p>  <pre><code>MyInkCanvas.SetBinding(InkCanvas.InkPresenter...) </code></pre>  <p><code>InkPresenter</code> isn't available. This makes sense because <code>InkPresenter</code> is a child, not a Dependency Property. But neither can I do</p>  <pre><code>MyInkCanvas.InkPresenter.SetBinding(...) </code></pre>  <p>I'm guessing that this is because <code>InkPresenter</code> comes from <code>Windows.UI.Inking</code> rather than <code>Windows.UI.Xaml</code>. But is there any way to set a binding on this property?</p>
