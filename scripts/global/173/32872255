<p>I saw some articles when Data Binding was announced have titles like this "Time To Leave findViewById", for some reason I thought it's going to be a replacement for libs like <a href="http://jakewharton.github.io/butterknife/" rel="nofollow">butterknife</a> but when I looked at it and it seemed to me that it's only links model classes to view (title -> R.id.title) so when change title in view or in code it will reflect on the other end. </p>  <p>Is that all to it or am I missing something else?</p>
