<p>I have a <code>DataGrid</code> that binds to an <code>ObservableCollection</code> in the <code>viewModel</code>. I wanted to sort the items of the <code>DataGrid</code> by many columns, so I would like the <code>ObservableCollection</code> in the <code>Viewmodel</code> to have the items in the same order. Otherwise, using the <code>SelectedIndex</code> property in the <code>ViewModel</code>, it could select incorrect items.</p>  <p>To do it, I try to use the <code>mode TwoWay</code> in the view, but the collection is not sorted in the view model.</p>  <p>So I would like to know if it is possible to sync this.</p>
