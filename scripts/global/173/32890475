<p>i have a main window that contains multiple UserControls, arranged as tab pages and tab groups (much like Visual Studio allows to have two or more editors visible at the same time). </p>  <p>I also have the possibility to open such an UserControl into a seperate floating window.</p>  <p>One of these UserControls contains simple form fields (e.g. text boxes). These text boxes are bounded with common databinding to an object / property. The binding mode is OnValidation (not on OnPropertyChanged). </p>  <p>When I switch the focus from this User Control inside the main window into another UserControl in the Main windows, the validation is automatically performed and the databinding is finised / the changed text will be set on the model object / property that is bounded to that text field.</p>  <p>But if I switch the focus to an UserControl which resides in another (floating) window, the databinding is not finished since no validation is performed.</p>  <p>I know that I can handle this manually by triggering ValidateChildren etc, but this seems to my the wrong way / is ugly. </p>  <p>Is there a "correct" / clean way to solve this issue? I want that the validation is performed as soon as the UserControl loses its focus or the window gets deactivated. </p>  <p>One information: On of my UserControls contains a TreeControl. If I edit a tree node label, and when I switch the focus to another (foating) window, the label edit is finished automatically. I want the corresponding behaviour for usual form fields regarding binding...</p>  <p>Thanks for help!</p>
