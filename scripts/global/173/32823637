<p>As a newbie in Angular, i am working a tutorial : WEB DEVELOPMENT WITH_ANGULARJS AND BOOTSTRAP via "Packt".</p>  <p>Below is the link in <a href="http://plnkr.co/edit/e0Jwt9ArCsYIrQCnM9fp?p=preview" rel="nofollow">plunker</a> to check the code implementation.</p>  <p>At the moment i am working on the Routing Events, specificly a login form where i added 2 links to change the view from the Login form to Report. The error i receive is when i click on these links it returns :</p>  <pre><code>{ "statusCode": 404,"error": "Not Found"} </code></pre>  <p>Furthermore the data binding for the "report" template won't work as well.</p>  <p>The version of Angular that is been used in the tutorial is <code>AngularJs v1.3.0</code>, however i am using <code>v1.4.6</code> and no problem have been occurred so far!</p>  <p>While most of the similar issue posts refer to a version compatibility issue , in my case any version of Angular i used it produces the same error.</p>  <p>Have i done anything wrong in the script.js configuration?</p>
