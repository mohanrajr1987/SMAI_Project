<p>I have two textboxes connect to an MS Access Database. if i put a decimal number in either textbox the I can't click anything else on the form until I remove those decimal places. I have no code behind these textboxes and to bind them I used Properties > Data bindings > Text and i also tried going in the database and changing the field type from double to decimal and nothing worked. </p>
