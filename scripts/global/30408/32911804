<p>I am trying to run a simple query to only select request that were received during a specific day. </p>  <p>Here is what I have: </p>  <pre><code>select * from [Table Name]  WHERE received_when(column name) like '2015-08-02%'   </code></pre>  <p>Here are the column results when I do a <code>select * from [Table Name]</code></p>  <p>2015-08-02 22:33:11.337 2015-08-02 22:33:57.243  2015-08-02 22:49:49.617  2015-08-02 22:50:34.600  2015-08-02 22:50:52.493  2015-08-02 22:51:12.600  2015-08-02 22:51:35.007  </p>  <p>I have used this query several times on other tables but for some reason this is returning 0 rows.  Thank you, Emley </p>
