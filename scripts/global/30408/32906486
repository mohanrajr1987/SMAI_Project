<p>I need an idea on how to accomplished this. </p>  <p>I develop a Windows application using C# which I install on all my client system and access SQL Server from one of the system set up as server. I am using VS 2010 and SQL Server 2008.</p>  <p>Everything works fine, but one of my client admin want to be able to use same software on his laptop at home or anywhere at least to view previous day report on his laptop whereas SQL Server is on lan network.</p>  <p>My question is that is there a way I can sync / switch his database connection every time his connected to office lan network and also create a kind of local database that would be updated once his connected to office network.</p>
