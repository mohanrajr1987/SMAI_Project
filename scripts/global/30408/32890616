<p>How can I adjust the following <code>UPDATE</code> statement?</p>  <p>There are 3000000 rows in the database table and this when I execute the <code>UPDATE</code> statement it takes forever to run. I been running this query from last 17 hours and haven't seen the result. But when I execute <code>select</code> statement it takes only 2 minutes and 36 seconds.  q is fact table while a is dimension table. </p>  <pre><code>UPDATE q SET q.[DID] = a.[DID] FROM [dbo].[CallDetail] q JOIN [DimSchart] a ON a.[Schart] = q.[Schart] WHERE q.[DID] IS NULL; GO </code></pre>
