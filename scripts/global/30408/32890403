<p>I'm trying to view software that has been installed within the last 30 days. The format of my date is <code>20150327</code>. When I try to the following condition in the <code>where</code> clause</p>  <pre><code>and DateDiff(day,arp.InstallDate0,GetDate()) &lt; 30 </code></pre>  <p>I receive the following error message:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Conversion failed when converting date and/or time from character   string.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I have also tried the following and was unsuccessful:</p>  <pre><code>CONVERT(varchar(8),arp.InstallDate0,112) </code></pre>  <p>As well as:</p>  <pre><code>ISDATE(CONVERT(datetime,arp.InstallDate0,112)) </code></pre>  <p>When I add <code>ISDATE</code>, it finally runs the query, but it is not showing any data and I know that there are installs within the last 30 days, so I'm thinking the date is still not being recognized.</p>  <p><strong><em>EDIT</em></strong> The InstallDate0 column is nvarchar.</p>
