<p>Table Name <code>[dbo].[SourceData]</code> has 19 millions rows.</p>  <p>I am running while loop against this table and based on match criteria it will load data into another table. While loop is taking longer than ever. </p>  <p>Sample code is below. <code>Sourcedata</code> table has <code>seqno</code> which is unique <code>identity</code> column (primary key). Also Firstname, lastname, address, emailaddress have individual NC index. </p>  <pre><code>create table #holdscore (      seqno bigint,       associatedseq bigint,       scrore int,       status varchar(20),      customerid varchar(30)       CONSTRAINT [PK_SourceScores]           PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED (seqno ASC, associatedseq ASC)  )   Create table #loop  (      seqno bigint primary key clustered,       Flag varchar(1) NULL )  Insert #loop (seqno)    select distinct TOP 1000 seqno         from [dbo].[SourceData]     order by seqno  Declare @seqno bigint Declare @firstname Nvarchar(100) Declare @lastname Nvarchar(100) Declare @phonenum nvarchar(100) Declare @emailadd Nvarchar(100) Declare @Address Nvarchar(250) Declare @MiddleName nvarchar(50) Declare @CCExpYYMM nvarchar(4) Declare @CCLastFour nvarchar(4)  While ((select count(*) from  #Loop where flag is null)&gt;0) Begin      Select top 1 @seqno = seqno from #Loop  where flag is null      Select @firstname = [FirstName],            @lastname = [LastName],            @phonenum = [PhoneNorm],            @emailadd = [EmailAddress],            @Address = [AddressNorm],            @MiddleName = [MiddleName],            @CCExpYYMM  = [CCExpYYMM],            @CCLastFour = [CCLastFour]      from  [dbo].[SourceData]      where seqno = @seqno       INSERT #holdscore          select               orginalseqno, associatedseq, score,               case when score &gt;= 80 Then 'Match'                   when score &lt; 80 Then 'Review'               end as Status,                customerid           from              (select                    @seqno orginalseqno, seqno as associatedseq,                   customerid,                   case                       when [FirstName] = @firstname                         and [LastName] = @lastname                         and [PhoneNorm] = @phonenum                         and [EmailAddress] = @emailadd                        and [AddressNorm] = @Address                         and [MiddleName] = @MiddleName                         and [CCExpYYMM]  = @CCExpYYMM                          and [CCLastFour] = @CCLastFour THEN '100'                       when [FirstName] = @firstname                        and [LastName] = @lastname                        and [PhoneNorm] = @phonenum                        and [EmailAddress] = @emailadd                       and [AddressNorm] = @Address                        and [MiddleName] = @MiddleName                        and [CCExpYYMM]  = @CCExpYYMM THEN '99'                      when [FirstName] = @firstname and [LastName]=@lastname and [PhoneNorm]=@phonenum and [EmailAddress]=@emailadd         and [AddressNorm] = @Address and [MiddleName] = @MiddleName and [CCLastFour] = @CCLastFour THEN '99'     WHEN [FirstName]=@firstname and [LastName]=@lastname and [PhoneNorm]=@phonenum and [EmailAddress]=@emailadd         and [AddressNorm] = @Address and [MiddleName] = @MiddleName                             Then '98'     WHEN [FirstName]=@firstname and [LastName]=@lastname and [PhoneNorm]=@phonenum and [EmailAddress]=@emailadd         and [AddressNorm] = @Address                                                            Then '93'     WHEN [FirstName]=@firstname and [LastName]=@lastname and [PhoneNorm]=@phonenum and [EmailAddress]=@emailadd  Then '83'     WHEN [FirstName]=@firstname and [LastName]=@lastname and [PhoneNorm]=@phonenum                               Then '68'     WHEN [FirstName]=@firstname and [LastName]=@lastname and [EmailAddress]=@emailadd                            Then '63'     WHEN [FirstName]=@firstname and [LastName]=@lastname and [PhoneNorm]=@phonenum and [AddressNorm] = @Address  Then '78'     WHEN [FirstName]=@firstname and [LastName]=@lastname and [EmailAddress]=@emailadd and [AddressNorm] = @Address  Then '73'     WHEN [FirstName]=@firstname and [LastName]=@lastname and [AddressNorm] = @Address                               Then '58'     WHEN [FirstName]=@firstname and [PhoneNorm]=@phonenum and [EmailAddress]=@emailadd and [AddressNorm] = @Address and [MiddleName] = @MiddleName  Then '73'     WHEN [LastName]=@lastname and [PhoneNorm]=@phonenum and [EmailAddress]=@emailadd and [AddressNorm] = @Address and [MiddleName] = @MiddleName  THEN '75'     WHEN [LastName]=@lastname and [PhoneNorm]=@phonenum and [EmailAddress]=@emailadd and [AddressNorm] = @Address                                 Then '70'     WHEN [LastName]=@lastname and [PhoneNorm]=@phonenum and [EmailAddress]=@emailadd                                                              THEN '60'      END AS Score   From   [dbo].[SourceData]    )A    where A.Score is not null   OPTION (MAXDOP 8)  Update #Loop set Flag = 'Y' where seqno =@seqno and Flag is null   end </code></pre>  <p>For 1000 unique seqno it takes more than 1 hour to complete. I need to compare 19 million rows with one another and load it into table. Please help me to make this process faster. So that I can load data into timely manner. SSIS will also work.</p>
