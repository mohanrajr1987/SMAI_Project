<p>I've been trying this all morning and can't find what I'm doing wrong. I have a string, 'XXYY0000' and I need the XX and YY seperatly.</p>  <p>So this works and gets the XX values:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT LEFT(l.LOAN_MATURITY, 2) FROM LOAN As l </code></pre>  <p>But why is this not working when I need to get the YY values?</p>  <pre><code>SELECT SUBSTRING(l.LOAN_MATURITY, 3, 2) FROM LOAN As l </code></pre>  <p>I researched and it should give the same output as the <code>MID()</code> function, but it gives me this error. </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Msg 8116, Level 16, State 1, Line 1</p>      <p>Argument data type numeric is invalid for argument 1 of substring function.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Why is the data type important for the <code>SUBSTRING</code> function but not the <code>LEFT</code> function?</p>
