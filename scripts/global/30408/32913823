<p>Hello I have a query where I am getting counts of records that are group by month (see example result below). What I would like SQL to do is have an additional Total row at the bottom which will be a sum of all the values in the "AccountID" column. I have highlighted the "Total" row where I would this addition to my current result set. Appreciate any help!!</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/wk0xX.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/wk0xX.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Below is my current query I am using to gather the data:</p>  <pre><code>  SELECT Distinct   Month = MONTH(pv.VisitStartDateTime)   ,AccountID_Count = count(pv.AccountID)      FROM  hpavisit pv With ( NOLOCK )    left outer join HPat pt With ( NOLOCK )    ON      pv.Pat_OID = pt.ObjectID    and pt.isdeleted = 0    Left Outer Join HCareUnit HCU With ( NOLOCK )    on      HCU.ObjectID = pv.PatLocation_oid    Left Outer Join HCareUnit HCU1 With ( NOLOCK )    on      HCU1.ObjectID = pv.UnitContacted_oid     WHERE pv.PatLocation_oid &lt;&gt; 0 and pv.PatLocation_oid is not null    and pv.IsDeleted = 0        and pv.VisitStartDateTime &gt; '08/31/2014 23:23:59'    and pv.VisitStartDateTime &lt; '03/01/2015'    GROUP BY MONTH(pv.VisitStartDateTime) </code></pre>
