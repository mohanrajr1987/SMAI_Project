<p>I have a view that SSMS end users use to dynamically pull sales data. Sometimes they will be using all ~20 of the columns in the view, other times they will be using 1-2 columns. </p>  <p>I'm trying to get join/table elimination to occur if a column isn't used in any particular query. The left join to <code>dbo.product_Type_grouping</code> joins on the table's primary key (<code>dataareaid, report_usage_id, product_type_code</code>) which I believe is the requirement to get it to work but in this case, it's not. </p>  <p>As a result, it's also then bringing the joins to <code>inventtable</code> &amp; <code>mbsbdreportinggrouptable</code> back in. </p>  <p>If I comment out that particular join, join elimination occurs on all the other tables (besides the columns part of the query, Trans &amp; Jour). </p>  <p>Any ideas? Thanks in advance ! </p>  <pre><code>SELECT     cij.deliveryname,     SUM(cit.lineamount) AS Sales FROM       syn.custinvoicetrans cit WITH (nolock)  LEFT JOIN     syn.custinvoicejour cij WITH (nolock) ON cij.dataareaid = cit.dataareaid                                           AND cij.invoiceid = cit.invoiceid                                           AND cij.invoicedate = cit.invoicedate  LEFT JOIN      syn.inventtable iv WITH (nolock) ON cit.dataareaid = iv.dataareaid                                       AND cit.mbsitemid = iv.itemid  LEFT JOIN      syn.dimensions d2 WITH (nolock) ON cij.dataareaid = d2.dataareaid                                      AND d2.dimensioncode = 0                                      AND cij.dimension = d2.num  LEFT JOIN      syn.mbsbdreportinggrouptable MG WITH (nolock) ON iv.dataareaid = mg.dataareaid                                                    AND iv.mbsreportinggroupid = MG.reportinggroupid  LEFT JOIN      dbo.product_type_grouping PG WITH (nolock) ON mg.dataareaid = pg.dataareaid                                                 AND pg.report_usage_id = '1'                                                 AND mg.reportinggroupid = pg.product_type_code WHERE       cij.invoicedate BETWEEN '1/1/2015' AND '9/15/2015'      AND cij.orderaccount IN ( 'C1356989' )  GROUP  BY      cij.deliveryname  </code></pre>  <p><strong>Edit:</strong> The predicate in the execution plan is the primary key/clustered index. The output list is blank if it matters at all.  </p>  <p><strong>Edit:</strong> Sorry I should have mentioned that this is a small sample of the definition for the View I mention. I am just using this query test getting the Join Elimination to work. The actual View has many more columns &amp; a few more tables. </p>
