<p>I have a table with statues, something like this:</p>  <pre><code>Item     - Status - Date 12345    - 1 - 8/29/2015 12345    - 3 - 9/1/2015 12345    - 5 - 9/30/2015 22245    - 1 - 9/28/2015 22245    - 3 - 9/30/2015 </code></pre>  <p>What I need to do is have a query which returns something along the lines of:</p>  <pre><code>Item - Status Today - Status 15 days ago - Status 30 days ago - Status 45 days ago 12345 -     5               5                    3                    1 22245 =     3               1                    1                    1 </code></pre>  <p>I can't figure out how to even do this in a query. </p>  <p>The interval is a set 15 days, and I need to know the status each item was in on that day.</p>  <p>Please help...</p>
