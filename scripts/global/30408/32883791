<p>On a version of SQL Server 2008, we have the following trigger code:</p>  <pre><code>ALTER TRIGGER [dbo].[TriggerName]  ON [dbo].[SQLTable]  FOR UPDATE, INSERT  AS    SET NOCOUNT ON     IF (SELECT Count(*) FROM inserted         WHERE NOT (Column1 &gt;= 0 AND Column1 &lt;= 100)) &gt; 0    BEGIN        RAISERROR 44444 ' &gt;= 0 And &lt;= 100'        ROLLBACK TRANSACTION    END    ........ </code></pre>  <p>Which seems working fine on SQL Server 2008 but not anymore on SQL Server 2012. On SQL Server 2012, it's always raising an error.</p>  <p>When I'm updating the trigger with, it's working on SQL Server 2012</p>  <pre><code>From TableName Join Inserted </code></pre>  <p>If it's not supported, what is the alternative ?</p>  <p>Do we just have to install a SQL Server 2008 again or do we have to adapt all the SQL code ?</p>  <p>Is there a list with deprecated features between SQL Server 2008 and SQL Server 2012 ?</p>  <p>Thank you for your support</p>
