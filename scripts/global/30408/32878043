<p>I have a table with a composite primary key of two columns.  In Dapper .NET I am using .Query by passing in my select statement, along with an array of the parameters.  I found out that dapper only expects a single object for parameters in SELECT statements, unlike Execute for INSERT and UPDATE, where I could do this:</p>  <pre><code>var batchParams = new List&lt;object&gt;(); batchParams.add(new      {     ID = 50,     Lang = 40     }); batchParams.add(new      {     ID = 20,     Lang = 31     }); </code></pre>  <p>And then I could just pass in this array to my execute call. Essentially, I want to run multiple select statements (each will retrieve one row), and then get the result back as an array of results.  Is this possible in dapper?  </p>
