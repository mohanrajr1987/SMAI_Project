<p>I'm trying to remake this excel sheet using SQL. </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZLNsP.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZLNsP.png" alt="Example "></a></p>  <p>I'm trying to make a total line grouping the LOAN_ACCT_1 with the same numbers. Then, I want to sum all the values in the colums following LOAN_AM. </p>  <p>I've been trying this for quite a while now, but I came the closest with using ROLLUP. The problem that I'm having is that I can't seem to group on the LOAN_ACCT_1 only.</p>  <p>I came close with this solution from this <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms189305(v=sql.90).aspx" rel="nofollow">microsoft site</a>, but I can't seem to finish the solution. Is there an easier way that I'm overlooking?</p>  <pre><code>SELECT CASE WHEN(GROUPING(l.LOAN_ACCT_1) = 1) THEN 'TOTAL'             ELSE ISNULL(l.LOAN_ACCT_1, 'UNKNOWN')             END AS LOAN_ACCT_1,        CASE WHEN(GROUPING(l.LOAN_TYPE) = 1) THEN 'ALL'             ELSE ISNULL(l.LOAN_TYPE, 'UNKNOWN')             END AS LOAN_TYPE,        SUM(l.LOAN_AMT_FINANCED) as LOAN_AMT_FINANCED FROM LLOAN As l GROUP BY l.LOAN_ACCT_1, LOAN_TYPE WITH ROLLUP ORDER BY l.LOAN_ACCT_1  </code></pre>
