<p>I have an install program created with NSIS that installs SQL server Express 2008 R2, creates an ODBC connection, and creates a folder with my application files. </p>  <p>After a reboot I run a cmd file that runs SQLCMD to create database and logins, then runs <code>ODBCCONF /a {configsysdsn "SQL Server" "DSN=test|Server=%COMPUTERNAME%\SQLILS|Database=test"}</code>, then runs a custom app that builds the database.</p>  <p>I have been running this successfully for over a year, until mid July 2015.  I now get an error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Build Database failed: No Data source defined</p> </blockquote>  <p>It seems that a Windows Update affecting SQL Security could be to blame.</p>  <p>Anyone have any ideas on how to overcome this? </p>
