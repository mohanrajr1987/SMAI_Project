<p>I have 3 tables in SQL Server 2008</p>  <ul> <li>Article</li> <li>Category</li> <li>ArticleToCategory</li> </ul>  <p>An article can be tagged to multiple categories, whose reference are stored in <code>ArticleToCategory</code>. Now I want to just fetch articles which exists in just parent categories (<code>Level</code> for whose will be 1 and <code>ParentID</code> will be -1) only, i.e.: if an article exists in parent category but also in child category it should skip those articles</p>  <p>I have written this query but it does not lists only articles from parent categories:</p>  <pre><code>select *  from ArticleToCategory  where CategoryId in (select Id from Category                       where ParentId = -1 and [Level] = 1) </code></pre>  <p>Can anyone tell me what would be the exact way to fetch categories as expected?</p>
