<pre><code>CREATE UNIQUE NONCLUSTERED INDEX [erm_UXAGC_WORKINGDRAWINGID]  ON [dbo].[INVENTTABLE] ([AGC_WORKINGDRAWINGID] ASC) WHERE ([AGC_WORKINGDRAWINGID] NOT IN ('', 'UR-GE')) </code></pre>  <p>Is this type of conditional indexing possible? From the docs, it says sql doesn't support OR syntax and you have to use IN, however I could not get this config to work as well, I get syntax error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Msg 102, Level 15, State 1, Line 9<br>   Incorrect syntax near 'NOT'.</p> </blockquote>
