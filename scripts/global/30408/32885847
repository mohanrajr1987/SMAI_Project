<p>I have a query which calculates the segments between start=6am and end=10pm. I want to keep the start and end variable to enable user to specify anything, so I created stored procedure with two time arguments variable but it is not working. Any idea why and how to fix it.</p>  <pre><code>Create procedure spGetUptimeBetweenStartAndEnd (start as time, end as time)    Remaining query goes here </code></pre>  <p>I tried </p>  <pre><code>spGetUptimeBetweenStartAndEnd 6, 10  </code></pre>  <p>and </p>  <pre><code>spGetUptimeBetweenStartAndEnd 6am, 10pm  </code></pre>  <p>but no luck.</p>
