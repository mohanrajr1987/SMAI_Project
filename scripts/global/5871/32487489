<p>Right now I have an enum with 5 base values that I want to be able to combine any of the 5 base values with each other to make a combined value, but I don't want a combined value able to be added to another base value.</p>  <p>For example:</p>  <pre><code>enum class Color {     Red,     Green,     Blue,     White,     Black }  Color red = Color::Red; Color green = Color::Green; Color yellow = red + green; // Ok; yellow = Color::Yellow (Not sure how I would define this value) Color orange = yellow + red; // Error; can't add to a combined value  // Note: It would be possible to add the same value to itself // for example: Color::Red + Color::Red = Color::RedRed </code></pre>  <p>I'm thinking this will probably have to be changed to a class with operator overloading rather than an enum, but I'm not sure how to prevent adding a combined value to another value.</p>  <p>What would be an elegant way of doing this?</p>
