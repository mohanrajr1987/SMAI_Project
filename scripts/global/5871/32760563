<p>I'm working on a project that doesn't use exceptions, and should stay that way. I overloaded (overrid will be more correct maybe) new operator in order to use my own memory manager. In my memory manager, in case of a failure in allocation - NULL is being returned. Now altough new operator returned NULL, the constructor is being called and then I get a seg fault because I didn't have memory allocated. The functionalitty that I'd want is that if the new operator returned NULL, then the constructor shouldn't be called (and I will check afterwards if the object was successfuly initialized).</p>  <p>I want it to work something like this:</p>  <pre><code>myObject = new object(...); if (NULL == myObject)     printf("error") else     do something </code></pre>  <p>Thanks!</p>
