<p>I'm writing a calculator program for complex numbers and I am getting an error during compiling that says </p>  <pre><code>In member function 'Complex Complex::operator*(const Complex&amp;)':   error: no match for 'operator*' (operand types are 'int' and 'const Imaginary')  iparts = (real * rhs.imagine) + (imagine * rhs.real);                 ^ </code></pre>  <p>What does this mean?</p>
