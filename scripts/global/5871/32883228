<p>I would like to use different methods to implement the respective get and set case, like this:</p>  <pre><code>public int this[int i] {     get { return i + 1; } }  public string this[int i] {     set { } } </code></pre>  <p>This leads to <code>error CS0111: Type 'Foo' already defines a member called 'this' with the same parameter types</code>.</p>  <p>It seems this functionality cannot be achieved in the naive way. Is there a workaround?</p>  <p>I would like to use it like this:</p>  <pre><code>class It {     string SomeProperty; }  class Bar {     Action this[string key] {         set {             // ...         }     }     string this[string key] {         get {             return new It ();         }     } }  Bar ["key"] = () =&gt; {}; Bar ["key"].SomeProperty = 5; </code></pre>
