<p>Is there a convention for what to name <code>other_object</code> in the following examples:</p>  <pre><code>def ==(other_object)   other_object.some_method == some_method end  def +(other_object)   self.class.new(other_object.to_i + to_i) end </code></pre>  <p>Update: I'm not asking for opinions on what a good naming scheme would be; I'm asking whether there are any established pre-existing naming conventions used in the Ruby community, and if so, what they are.  This is not an opinion-based question.</p>
