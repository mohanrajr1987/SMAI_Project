<p>I need an expert review on this statement. I encountered this statement during my recent java interview.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Adding Operator overloading to java would have definitely made design   more complex than without it, and it might have lead to more complex   compiler or slows the JVM .</p> </blockquote>  <p>justify this ?</p>  <ol> <li><p>From the above lines i have got 2 questions , how it could slow down the  jvm if assume there was operator overloading support in java , because overloading is being resolved during compile time , and jvm is all about run time perspective (correct me if i am wrong at this) .</p></li> <li><p>by making complex compilers we can have more freedom of business logic.</p></li> </ol>
