<p>I have seen the following code:</p>  <pre><code>class SomeClass { public:     int mA;     int mB;     int mC;     int mD;      int operator[] (const int index) const     {         return ((int*)(this))[index];     } }; </code></pre>  <p>How does this work? I know the this keyword is a pointer to this class but without property knowing how many variables there are ... how can we safely access [index] of "this" pointer?</p>
