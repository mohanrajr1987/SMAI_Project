<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/77718/why-doesnt-java-offer-operator-overloading?rq=1">This question</a> states that Java has no operator overloading. An answer to that states that <code>"a" + "b"</code> is possible even if that really looks like an overloaded <code>+</code>. My question is simple: if <code>+</code> can only ever sum numbers and it cannot be overloaded, how can <code>"a" + "b"</code> (<code>string + string</code>) possibly work?</p>
