<p>I just started a class in Oracle SQL and we were given an assignment to create 3 entity and 2 relation tables. He gave us these fields and said add as we feel necessary:</p>  <pre><code>Course: department, semester, maximumEnrolled Instructor: firstName, lastName, ssn Room: roomNumber, building Teaches: instructor, course Uses: course, room </code></pre>  <p>When I created the tables, only the first 4 worked but I am not able to create the uses table. The error is: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>ORA-02270: no matching unique or primary key for this column-list.</p> </blockquote>  <p>This is what I did:</p>  <pre><code>CREATE TABLE course     (course_id NUMBER(4) PRIMARY KEY,     courseName VARCHAR2(30) NOT NULL,     department VARCHAR2(50),     semester VARCHAR2(10),     maximumEnrolled NUMBER(36) NOT NULL);  CREATE TABLE room     (roomNo NUMBER(5) PRIMARY KEY,     building VARCHAR2(10));  CREATE TABLE instructor     (instructor_id NUMBER(6) PRIMARY KEY,     firstName VARCHAR2(20),     lastName VARCHAR2(30) NOT NULL     ssn NUMBER(9) NOT NULL);  CREATE TABLE teaches     (instructor_id NUMBER(5) NOT NULL,     course_id NUMBER(4) NOT NULL,     teachingCourse VARCHAR2(4) PRIMARY KEY,      CONSTRAINT instructor_fk FOREIGN KEY (instructor_id) REFERENCES instructor (instructor_id)     CONSTRAINT course_fk FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES course (course_id));  CREATE TABLE uses     (course_id NUMBER(4) NOT NULL,     roomNo NUMBER(5) NOT NULL,     roomUse VARCHAR2(4) PRIMARY KEY,     CONSTRAINT course_fk FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES course (course_id)     CONSTRAINT room_fk FOREIGN KEY (roomNo) REFERENCES room (roomNo)); </code></pre>  <p>I thought maybe the problem is that I used course_id as a FK in the teaches table so I tried:</p>  <pre><code>CREATE TABLE uses   (roomUsage VARCHAR2(30) PRIMARY KEY,   roomNo NUMBER(5) NOT NULL,   courseName VARCHAR2(30) NOT NULL,   CONSTRAINT room_fk FOREIGN KEY (roomNo) REFERENCES room (roomNo),   CONSTRAINT course_fk FOREIGN KEY (courseName) REFERENCES course (courseName)); </code></pre>  <p>But it didn't work either and gave the same error. What am I doing wrong?</p>
