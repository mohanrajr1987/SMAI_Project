<p>I am using Sqlite3.</p>  <p>I have a table, 'Team', which has a nullable list of 'Player's.</p>  <p>Each 'Player' is a unique id which is a foreign key to another table 'Player'.</p>  <p>Each 'Team' can have a max of 10 'Player's.</p>  <p>Each 'Player' is named like this:</p>  <pre><code>"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS " "Team" "(" "TeamID varchar(64) PRIMARY KEY," "UserID varchar(64) NOT NULL," "League varchar(255) NOT NULL," "PlayerID_1 varchar(64)," "PlayerID_2 varchar(64)," "PlayerID_3 varchar(64)," "PlayerID_4 varchar(64)," "PlayerID_5 varchar(64)," "PlayerID_6 varchar(64)," "PlayerID_7 varchar(64)," "PlayerID_8 varchar(64)," "PlayerID_9 varchar(64)," "PlayerID_10 varchar(64)," "FOREIGN KEY (UserID) REFERENCES User(UserID)," "FOREIGN KEY (PlayerID_1) REFERENCES Player(PlayerID)," "FOREIGN KEY (PlayerID_2) REFERENCES Player(PlayerID)," "FOREIGN KEY (PlayerID_3) REFERENCES Player(PlayerID)," "FOREIGN KEY (PlayerID_4) REFERENCES Player(PlayerID)," "FOREIGN KEY (PlayerID_5) REFERENCES Player(PlayerID)," "FOREIGN KEY (PlayerID_6) REFERENCES Player(PlayerID)," "FOREIGN KEY (PlayerID_7) REFERENCES Player(PlayerID)," "FOREIGN KEY (PlayerID_8) REFERENCES Player(PlayerID)," "FOREIGN KEY (PlayerID_9) REFERENCES Player(PlayerID)," "FOREIGN KEY (PlayerID_10) REFERENCES Player(PlayerID)" ");"; </code></pre>  <p>My question is, how can I easily insert a new 'Player' into the table? I need a way to iterate over each current 'Player' in the table, to find the first NULL column.</p>  <p>I am interfacing with this db from C, and it wouldn't be so hard to get the table into memory with a query, iterate over it in memory to find the first NULL 'Player', and insert the new one there, but that seems extremely inefficient!</p>  <p>Also, if this is design is bad, please feel free to propose a better one! I am still pretty new to db design.</p>
