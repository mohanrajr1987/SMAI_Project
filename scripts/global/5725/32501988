<p>I'm using Microsoft SQL Server 2012.</p>  <p>I have three tables, A, M, Z.</p>  <p>Table A has a 1 to many relationship with the table M. It also has a delete cascade on the foreign key</p>  <p>Table Z is a new table and it should also have a 1 to many relationship with table M, again there should be a delete cascade on the foreign key.</p>  <p>I take it my designed is flawed? Because if I delete a record from table A the corresponding records in table M will be deleted but I'm guessing this will break the relationship between table M &amp; Z? Is that correct?</p>
