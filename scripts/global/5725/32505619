<p>I have the following mapping for joining tables 'Company and 'Employee'</p>  <pre><code>@Entity @Table(name = "Company") @SecondaryTable(name = "employee",  pkJoinColumns=@PrimaryKeyJoinColumn(name="employee_id", referencedColumnName="id"))  @NamedQuery(name = "findEmp",             query = "SELECT C FROM Company c WHERE c.employee_id=:eid") </code></pre>  <p>I get the following error for the namedQuery </p>  <pre><code>could not resolve property: employee_id  </code></pre>  <p>When I try to add an explicit member 'employee_id' in the Company table, I get a 'repeated mapping exception. What may be the issue?</p>
