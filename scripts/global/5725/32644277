<p>I'm developing an application, actually a billing system. Here accountant can add invoice for a client.</p>  <p>I have two tables, <code>users</code> and <code>invoices</code>:</p>  <pre><code>invoices (user_id, created_by) users (id) </code></pre>  <p>Invoices has two columns, <code>user_id</code> and <code>created_by</code>, I want both to be linked with <code>id</code> of the <code>users</code> table. </p>  <p>Already <code>user_id</code> has been added as foreign key. Now I'm trying to add <code>created_by</code> as foreign key. So issued following command:</p>  <pre><code>ALTER TABLE `invoices` ADD FOREIGN KEY (`created_by`) REFERENCES `secureap_maind`.`users` (`id`) ON DELETE RESTRICT ON UPDATE RESTRICT; </code></pre>  <p>And I'm getting an error message.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>#1452 - Cannot add or update a child row: a foreign key constraint fails (<code>secureap_maind</code>.<code>#sql-3717_a323d</code>, CONSTRAINT <code>#sql-3717_a323d_ibfk_2</code> FOREIGN KEY (<code>created_by</code>) REFERENCES <code>users</code> (<code>id</code>)) </p> </blockquote>  <p>I'm not sure if I can add two columns as foreign key. IF possible, can you please advice to do that?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
