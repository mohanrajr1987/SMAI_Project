<p>I working on a data export for a painfully denormalized COTS product and am hung up over how to plug display values in my selection for columns that contain a delimited string of foreign keys.</p>  <p>Assume the following sets of data for example.</p>  <p><strong>DEPARTMENTS</strong> table:</p>  <pre><code>Key   Value --------------------------------- 1     Finance 2     Human Resources 3     Public Affairs 4     Information Technology </code></pre>  <p><strong>PERSONNEL</strong> table:</p>  <pre><code>PK    FName    LName    Departments ------------------------------------------------- 111   Marty    Graw     1|~*~|3|~*~| 222   Rick     Shaw     2|~*~|4|~*~| 333   Jean     Poole    4|~*~|2|~*~|3|~*~|1|~*~| </code></pre>  <p>Desired output from select:</p>  <pre><code>FName    LName    Departments ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Marty    Graw     Finance, Public Affairs Rick     Shaw     Human Resources, Information Technology Jean     Poole    Information Technology, Human Resources, Public Affairs, Finance </code></pre>  <p>I've found examples of how to deal with delimited strings but nothing that really seems to fit this particular scenario. Ideally I'd like to figure out how I could do it without having to create functions etc. as my permissions are pretty limited.</p>
