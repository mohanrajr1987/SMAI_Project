<p>I have a MySQL event in my database that moves photos older than a day to the archives_photos table and subsequently deletes them from the Photos table. The only problem is that I have a likes table that has the photo_id as a foreign key on its table as a reference to the photo on the photos table. The event won't delete the photo because of this. I get the error: <strong>"Cannot delete or update a parent row: a foreign key constraint fails"</strong> Is there a work around for this. Do I just need to remove the foreign key? I just need to be pointed in the right direction. Here's my database design:</p>  <pre><code>photos ______  photo_id (binary 16) filename user_id (foreign key) created_at (datetime)  likes ______  likes_id (binary 16) photo_id_fk (foreign key) created_at (datetime) from_user (foreign key) to_user (foreign key) </code></pre>
