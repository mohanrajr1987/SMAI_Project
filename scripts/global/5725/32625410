<p><br> I have to work with Hibernate and I am not very sure how to solve this problem, I have 2 tables with a 1..n relationship like this:<br></p>  <pre> ------- TABLE_A ------- col_b (pk) col_c (pk) [other fields]  ------- TABLE_B ------- col_a (pk) col_b (pk) (fk TABLE_A.col_b) col_c (fk TABLE_A.col_c) [other fields] </pre>  <p>How can I manage this with Hibernate?</p>  <p>I do not have any idea how to declare a foreign key that would contain a part of primary key.</p>  <p>My database schema is generated from the Hibernate model.</p>
