<p>Note: This question may possibly be poorly asked as my knowledge of SQL is quite limited.</p>  <p>We have 3 tables, <strong>BUILDINGS</strong>, <strong>FLOORS</strong>, <strong>ROOMS</strong>.</p>  <p><strong>BUILDINGS</strong> contains the columns: Building_ID(its primary key), and Name(its name)</p>  <p><strong>FLOORS</strong> contains the columns: Floor_ID(its primary key), Name(its name), and Building_ID(foreign key to <strong>BUILDINGS</strong>' primary key)</p>  <p><strong>ROOMS</strong> contains the columns: Room_ID(its primary key), Name(its name), Building_ID(foreign key to <strong>BUILDINGS</strong>' primary key), and Floor_ID(foreign key to <strong>FLOORS</strong>' primary key)</p>  <p>My problem is, if I have two buildings, 1 and 2, and two floors, 1 and 2, if floor 1 belongs to building 1, and floor 2 belongs to building 2 (that is building 2 has no floor 1, and building 1 has no floor 2) it is possible to add a room which is in building 1, floor 2, even though this should not exist.</p>  <p>How can I correct my structure to ensure only valid rooms may be added? And if I were to scale out again, another table <strong>DESKS</strong> which would have an associated <strong>BUILDING</strong>, <strong>FLOOR</strong>, and <strong>ROOM</strong> would this solution still work?</p>
