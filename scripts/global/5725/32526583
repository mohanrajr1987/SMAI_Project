<p>I have next table structure :</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Clay1.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Clay1.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p><code>RoomId</code> and <code>HouseId</code> are nullable, one field is always null. I got next exception while attempt to delete row from <code>Houses</code> table.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The DELETE statement conflicted with the REFERENCE constraint   "FK_dbo.Images_dbo.Rooms_RoomId"</p> </blockquote>  <p>Why the cascade delete fails? I have used EF code first.</p>  <p><b>EDIT</b></p>  <p>Working trigger based on @Juan Carlos example:</p>  <pre><code>BEGIN TRANSACTION     delete from images     where houseId in ( select id from deleted )     delete from images     where roomId in (                         select rooms.Id                        from rooms                         where rooms.HouseId in (select id from deleted)                    )     delete from Rooms     where houseId in ( select id from deleted )     delete from houses     where ID in ( select ID from deleted )  COMMIT </code></pre>
