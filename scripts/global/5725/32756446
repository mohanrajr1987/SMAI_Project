<p>I'm designing db for auto parts. I need to create a structure where will be groups, sub-groups and auto parts. Each part will belong to one sub-group, but the sub-group could have parent sub-group. This parent sub-group could belong to higher level sub-group. In the end there will be just group - the root. So it's a classic tree. The problem is that there is no fixed number of groups. Sometimes it can be Group -> Sub-Group -> Auto Part,  sometimes it can be Group -> Sub-Group -> Sub-Group -> Sub-Group -> Auto Part.</p>  <p>Now i have three tables: Groups, SubGroups, AutoParts.  How i should design relation between subgroups?  Is it a good idea to make a foreign key called parent sub-group in the SubGroups table that will reference to the other row in the same table? In case when there is only Group in the upper level this property will be null.</p>
