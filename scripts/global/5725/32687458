<p>I building my first PostgreSQL database. It covers where people lived and worked over several decades (1890 to 1930). I have people, address, and restaurant name tables. The people moved around, both their residences and places of work.</p>  <p><strong>How do I establish the link to say from a person to the address for certain years?</strong> In other words there might be from 1 to ~20 years (some people stayed put), but I'll want to query for each year (actually it's going to become a map).</p>  <p>I understand that if it were only once, it would be a foreign key.</p>  <p>I'm also going to be linking restaurant names to various addresses. In some cases I only have the names of the owners, so I'll have a link by year and whether they were employees or owners. I'll tackle that one next. Maybe with the first question answered I'll see my way to this one.</p>  <p>Thanks for any help.</p>
