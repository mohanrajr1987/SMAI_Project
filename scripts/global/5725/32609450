I'm running into a problem trying to create the "ATTENDANCE" table.  It says "syntax error near "FOREIGN" ". Now, I don't get this because, as you can see I have created the "TIMETABLE" table successfully and in the "ATTENDANCE" table too followed more or less the same syntax.  I've even tried commenting out the Foreign key. It works fine with just the primary key constraint, but when I couple it with the foreign key constraint the error shows up again. If I comment out the primary key part, with only the foreign key constraint, then it says "syntax error near "SUBJECT" ". So, please help.</p>
