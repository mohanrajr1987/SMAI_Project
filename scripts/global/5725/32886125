<p>I have a website which has a users table and a movies table.  I am creating a favourites table so that users can save movies to their favourites list.  The question is concerning the favourites table which I have been adviced to use the below :</p>  <pre><code>CREATE TABLE Favorites (   user_id INT NOT NULL,   movie_id INT NOT NULL,   PRIMARY KEY (user_id, movie_id),   FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES Users(user_id),   FOREIGN KEY (movie_id) REFERENCES Movies(movie_id) );  </code></pre>  <p>I noticed when reading about foreign keys there is an 'ON DELETE' and 'ON UPDATE' option where you can set to restrict, cascade etc...</p>  <p>If a user has favourited many movies, and then one of the movies is deleted from the movie table, what would happen if it the foreign key was set to "CASCADE"?  would any rows from the favourites table be deleted also?  What would happen if the foreign key was set to "RESTRICT"?  </p>  <p>I am just after a basic explanation as I do not currently fully understand this.</p>
