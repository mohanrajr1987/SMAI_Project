<p>I have a database with three tables: <code>Word</code>, <code>Idiom</code>, <code>WordIdiom</code> that stores many to many relation between this two tables. <code>WordItem</code> includes only foreign keys for <code>Word</code> and <code>Idiom</code> tables.</p>  <p>After that, I have created Entity model, based on database. I have filled two tables with relevant content, and now I want to add cross-links between these tables.</p>  <p>So, I have written this code: </p>  <pre><code>using (var db = new IdiomsDictionaryEntities()) {     var allIdioms = from idiom in db.Idioms select idiom;      foreach (var idiom in allIdioms)     {         string[] words = idiom.IdiomText.Split(new[] { " ", "-" }, StringSplitOptions.None);          foreach (var word in words)         {             var wordItem = db.Words.SingleOrDefault(exWord =&gt; exWord.WordString.ToLower().Equals(word));             if (wordItem == null)             {                 Console.WriteLine("Idiom: " + idiom.IdiomText + ", missing word: " + word);                 continue;             }              idiom.Words.Add(wordItem);              db.SaveChanges();         }     } } </code></pre>  <p>But when I run this code, I'm getting following error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>An unhandled exception of type 'System.Data.Entity.Infrastructure.DbUpdateException' occurred in EntityFramework.dll<br>   Additional information: An error occurred while saving entities that do not expose foreign key properties for their relationships. The EntityEntries property will return null because a single entity cannot be identified as the source of the exception. Handling of exceptions while saving can be made easier by exposing foreign key properties in your entity types. See the InnerException for details.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Inner-inner exception:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Unable to update the EntitySet 'WordIdiomMatch' because it has a DefiningQuery and no  element exists in the  element to support the current operation.`</p> </blockquote>  <p>As it is my first time with Entity Framework, I'm really don't know how to fix this. I have tried to add <code>[ForeignKey()]</code> property to Entity Framework models, but probably have done it wrong. I have also tried to add a primary key for <code>WordIdiom</code>, but it brakes even more things, as in this case I cannot even add items to <code>Word</code> and <code>Idiom</code> tables.</p>
