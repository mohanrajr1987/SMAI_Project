<p>I want to achieve the same result as the below question but in MVC. </p>  <pre><code>    public ActionResult Index()      {         //List&lt;Systems&gt; systems;         //var query = db.SystemFamily.Select(c =&gt; c.SystemFamilyID).ToList();         //foreach (var sid in query)         //{         //    systems = db.Systems.Select(c =&gt; c.SystemFamilyID == sid).ToList();         //}         //int count = systems.Count();//Here you will  get count          //ViewBag.Counts = count;          var viewmodel = new Sys_SysFam();         foreach (var item in db.SystemFamily)         {             int id = item.SystemFamilyID;              //SystemsCount              int count = db.Systems.Where(x =&gt; x.SystemFamilyID == id).Count();   // Here while debugging it has the value for id but throws exception.              item.SystemsCount = count;         }         ViewBag.Count = db.SystemFamily.Where(x=&gt;x.deleteFlag==false).Count();   //All these work         int count1 =db.Systems.Count();    // I even tried it with a where condition passing a SystemFamilyID. Even that worked         ViewBag.SCount = count1;         return View(db.SystemFamily.Where(x=&gt;x.deleteFlag==false).ToList());     } </code></pre>  <p>I get exception </p>  <p><em>An exception of type 'System.Data.Entity.Core.EntityCommandExecutionException' occurred in EntityFramework.SqlServer.dll but was not handled in user code</em></p>  <p><em>Additional information: An error occurred while executing the command definition.
