<p>I am using <a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/bulk-import-export-orders-to-csv.html" rel="nofollow">Bulk Import+Export Orders</a> to CSV extension to import my old orders into Magento and it works pretty good for it.</p>  <p>When I tried to put payment method as "paypal_express" it still was importing the orders of type "checkmo".</p>  <p>Upon looking into the source code file on line 182:</p>  <pre><code>/app/code/community/Raveinfosys/Exporter/Model/Createorder.php </code></pre>  <p>I found this:</p>  <pre><code>$orderPayment = Mage::getModel('sales/order_payment')           -&gt;setStoreId($this-&gt;store_id)           -&gt;setCustomerPaymentId(0)           -&gt;setMethod('checkmo')           -&gt;setPoNumber(' - ');          $order-&gt;setPayment($orderPayment); </code></pre>  <p>Which means, the value for payment method was static. So I went ahead and changed it to this:</p>  <pre><code>$orderPayment = Mage::getModel('sales/order_payment')           -&gt;setStoreId($this-&gt;store_id)           -&gt;setCustomerPaymentId(0)           -&gt;setMethod($sales_order_arr['payment']['method'])           -&gt;setPoNumber(' - ');          $order-&gt;setPayment($orderPayment); </code></pre>  <p>Now the problem is, it tries to verify the payment through PayPal servers and gives the PayPal verification error.</p>  <p>What I want is to create an order with method PayPal and without verifying it through PayPal, because I have many orders to import.</p>  <p>Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks!</p>
