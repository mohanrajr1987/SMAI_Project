<p>I'm getting the same error as reported in this question <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32755674/ios9-getting-error-an-ssl-error-has-occurred-and-a-secure-connection-to-the-ser">iOS9 getting error “an ssl error has occurred and a secure connection to the server cannot be made”</a> </p>  <p>I've checked with SSL labs using the PayPal URL <a href="https://mobileclient.paypal.com" rel="nofollow">https://mobileclient.paypal.com</a> and it tells me that the it only supports the following ciphers...</p>  <pre><code>TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5 TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA </code></pre>  <p>Which don't match exactly the ciphers listed in the Apple Documentation <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/technotes/App-Transport-Security-Technote/" rel="nofollow">https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/technotes/App-Transport-Security-Technote/</a></p>  <p>I wanted to ask is it the fact the ciphers aren't exactly the same the issue? I certainly don't want to bypass ATS as far as PayPal is concerned, do I?</p>
