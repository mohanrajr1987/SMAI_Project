<p>I integrated this library <a href="https://github.com/paypal/PayPal-Android-SDK" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/paypal/PayPal-Android-SDK</a> to my Application. Sandbox works fine, but production fails when I try to pay directly.</p>  <p>PayPal manual explain this reason. I can't use REST Api for direct payments in my country. But I can use Classic API.</p>  <p>So I registered application here <a href="https://www.paypal-apps.com/user/my-account/applications" rel="nofollow">https://www.paypal-apps.com/user/my-account/applications</a> and got Sandbox ID and Live App ID.</p>  <p>But what next? If I use this Sandbox ID, PayPal SDK says that it's not right ID. As I understand PayPal SDK tries to use REST API automatically. But how I can use it for Classic API?</p>  <p>Googling this problem gets me to this page <a href="http://paypal.github.io/sdk/" rel="nofollow">http://paypal.github.io/sdk/</a>, but there's no Android library (Android tab exists, but useless).</p>  <p>How to connect Classic API by PayPal SDK?</p>
