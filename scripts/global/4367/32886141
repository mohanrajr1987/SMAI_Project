<p>I have implemented my Paypal web application for chained payment in the current format  1)Fetch the basic product details from the user upon the button click</p>  <p>2)Fill up the PayRequest object with sender and receiver details (including the primary and secondary receivers), here I set the actionType to "create" because I need an explicit transaction,then I encode the object in Json format and create an Http request with all the required headers as mentioned in the Paypal site,I send this http request to  the following url "<a href="https://svcs.sandbox.paypal.com/AdaptivePayments/Pay" rel="nofollow">https://svcs.sandbox.paypal.com/AdaptivePayments/Pay</a>"</p>  <p>3)Then I fetch the Payresponse from paypal server for the above http request Now this PayResponse Object Contains the PayKey which I save to the db to track the transanction Now I redirect the user to the following url "<a href="https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_ap-payment+paykey=MyPayKey" rel="nofollow">https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_ap-payment+paykey=MyPayKey</a>" to initiate a chained payment After the Paypal concludes the transaction the user is redirected back to my website</p>  <p>4)I have implemented an IPNlistener to save the transaction details to the db</p>  <p>I am a newbie to this , I don't know whether this is the correct implementation of a chained payment for Paypal Am I doing it the wrong way or should I make changes to my current work flow.If I want to cover mobile apps how drastic would be the changes .Any guidance regarding this would be much appreciated.</p>
