<p>This is as weird as it gets.</p>  <p>I've been using the same paypal code on my dev enviroment (sandbox) for over 2 months.</p>  <p>Today when I get redirected to paypal (to pay a transaction) I get this error</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ku2f7.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ku2f7.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I have no clue about what could possibly be cuasing this error as I didn't change ANYTHING in the code at all.</p>  <p>Any ideas?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
