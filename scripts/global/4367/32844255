<p>It's really weird or perhaps there is something which i am doing wrong.</p>  <p>I am using ocommerce and paypal sandbox. </p>  <p>On checking out to paypal sandbox it is showing Price and VAT on the left side and also after logged in the paypal account it is still showing the VAT value but after checkout when i see the transaction details it does not show VAT Value it shows zero and total price including VAT Value. </p>  <p>Is there something wrong in paypal sandbox? </p>  <p>I also got the same question asked by a stackoverflow user but still noone has ever gave an answer to his question <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19909253/paypal-express-checkout-vat-show-0-00">Paypal express checkout VAT show 0.00</a></p>  <p>Any comment or answer will appreciate. Thanking in advance.</p>
