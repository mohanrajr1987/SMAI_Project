<p>I'm using PayPal .NET SDK for REST API v1.5 and I've always been able to successfully use the sandbox mode for testing. Since this afternoon <em>create payment API</em> (creating them with authorize intent) in sandbox mode gives me a response with the wrong links, more specifically:</p>  <pre><code>1. GET, SELF, https://127.0.0.1/v1/payments/payment/PAY-3J041487P5058351GKYHKEDQ 2. REDIRECT, AUTHORIZE, https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_express-checkout&amp;token=EC-2W7266730F1412848 3. POST, EXECUTE, https://127.0.0.1/v1/payments/payment/PAY-3J041487P5058351GKYHKEDQ/execute </code></pre>  <p>I've always got back the sandbox links for the 3 of them whilst now, as you can see, 2 of them point to localhost and one (the one that I actually need to authorize the payment) points to Live paypal.</p>  <p>When using Live mode instead of sandbox everything works fine.</p>  <p>Anyone else getting this ? Could it be just a temporary problem with the sandbox environment? or could it depend on the SDK?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
