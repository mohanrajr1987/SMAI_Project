<p>I am trying to construct a website build by wordpress, user view the post must get paid. Is there any plugin can fulfil the following case ?</p>  <ol> <li>User to become a premium user -> Paid for a membership by paypal or check by site admin manually.</li> <li>Premium User view the premium post and after a certain counter (e.g. after view 30 posts), membership will expired and need to pay again.</li> </ol>  <p>My site already have plugin "Facebook All" to control the user auth. I tried a plugin called "PaidMembershipsPro" but it seems their membership expire mechanism is count by date instead of posts view counter.</p>
