<p>To begin with, I already posted the same question in serverfault.com and received no help, so I'm repeating it here out of desperation.</p>  <p>Recently PayPal is requiring servers to support SHA-256. Here's an article referring to this issue:</p>  <p><a href="https://www.paypal-knowledge.com/infocenter/index?page=content&amp;id=FAQ1766&amp;expand=true&amp;locale=en_US" rel="nofollow">https://www.paypal-knowledge.com/infocenter/index?page=content&amp;id=FAQ1766&amp;expand=true&amp;locale=en_US</a></p>  <p>At the top of the article, it states,</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Update your integration to support certificates using the SHA-256 algorithm. PayPal is upgrading SSL certificates on all Live and Sandbox endpoints from SHA-1 to the stronger and more robust SHA-256 algorithm.</p> </blockquote>  <p>We have a dedicated CentOS server with numerous sites, mostly WordPress. Quite a few use PayPal IPN but do not have dedicated IPs or SSL Certificates. What needs to be changed to the server so these sites will support SHA-256? Our server is situated with Limestone Networks so I've created a ticket and asked repeatedly for assistance to no avail. They keep repeating SSL's need to be updated on the server. Would that be a wildcase SSL certificate in the usage case I described? Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.</p>
