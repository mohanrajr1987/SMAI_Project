<p>We have a form that allows users to setup recurring payments. Recurring payments are done using PayPal accounts. Often times users will checkout as a guest, and will pay for the initial installment and will not register using a PayPal account. The end results of this is that the recurring payments aren't being made, as they have used a credit card for their paymeent, and they don't login and approve their recurring transactions.</p>  <p>Is it possible to disable checkout as a guest for recurring payments on a per checkout basis? We don't want this on an account basis, as there are other scenarios where we do want to allow checkout as guest.</p>
