<p>I am getting a problem with the PayPal REST Api, sometimes it works fine! (and on sandbox it works 100%) But on the live system when connecting to the live PayPal system. I sometimes get the follow error. </p>  <pre><code>PayPal.ConnectionException: Invalid HTTP response: The request was aborted: Could not create SSL/TLS secure channel. at  PayPal.Api.HttpConnection.Execute(String payLoad, HttpWebRequest      httpRequest) at PayPal.Api.PayPalResource.ConfigureAndExecute[T]     (APIContext apiContext, HttpMethod httpMethod, String resource, String      payload, String endpoint, Boolean setAuthorizationHeader) at      PayPal.Api.OAuthTokenCredential.GenerateOAuthToken() at      PayPal.Api.OAuthTokenCredential.GetAccessToken() </code></pre>  <p>Basically is just keep crashing when trying to get the access token from PayPal</p>  <p>I have updated the SDK to the latest version and the code had been happily working for +3 months.</p>
