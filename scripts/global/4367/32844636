<p>Today I have a problem with PayPal checkout in my iOS application.</p>  <p>After user login, I receive an error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>PayPal SDK: Request has failed with error: PAYMENT_CREATION_ERROR - There was a problem setting up this payment. Please visit the PayPal website to check your account. (422) | PayPal Debug-ID: caf4fb9d7f20c [sandbox, PayPal iOS SDK 2.12.2]</p> </blockquote>  <p>The buyer account has enough balance and I think is ok. Is there a way to find a reason for this error?</p>
