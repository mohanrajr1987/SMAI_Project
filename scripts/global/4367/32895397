<p>So, here's my challenge: I have to build a webservice which handles payments using PayPal... The SOAP way! Since I'm a Node developer I'm very familiar with REST but the challenge is that I have to build it with Java, XML-schemas and SOAP using the Spring-framework.  Now I found this workflow when using REST: <a href="https://devtools-paypal.com/guide/pay_paypal/java?interactive=ON&amp;env=sandbox" rel="nofollow">https://devtools-paypal.com/guide/pay_paypal/java?interactive=ON&amp;env=sandbox</a>. That looks easy as pie to me! But what would this workflow look like when using SOAP and how would you implement this. As in: How do you handle redirects and responseURLs? Or is the workflow different?</p>  <p>P.S. I know PayPal has lots and lots of documentation but when it comes to SOAP, I just can't figure out the workflow or how to handle responseURLs..</p>  <p>Thnx in advance!</p>
