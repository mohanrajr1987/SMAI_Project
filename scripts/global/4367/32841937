<p>I recently added SSL to my site (www.uberwriteronline.com) and my PayPal IPN stopped working.  I learned that my SSL cert didn't meet PayPal's standards.  <a href="https://www.paypal-knowledge.com/infocenter/index?page=content&amp;id=FAQ1766&amp;expand=true&amp;locale=en_US" rel="nofollow">https://www.paypal-knowledge.com/infocenter/index?page=content&amp;id=FAQ1766&amp;expand=true&amp;locale=en_US</a> </p>  <p>I had a SHA-2 certificate, but it was being signed by a GoDaddy G2 root certificate.  I'm not clear on how to regenerate the CSR using the G5 root certificate.  I installed the G5 root certificate on my machine from <a href="https://knowledge.verisign.com/support/mpki-for-ssl-support/index?page=content&amp;actp=CROSSLINK&amp;id=SO5624" rel="nofollow">https://knowledge.verisign.com/support/mpki-for-ssl-support/index?page=content&amp;actp=CROSSLINK&amp;id=SO5624</a> but when I regenerate the CSR it still points to G2.  Sorry for the noob question, but how to I get this to use the G5 root?</p>
