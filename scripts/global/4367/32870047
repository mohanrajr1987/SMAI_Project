<p>I'm implementing PayPal payments in iOS application. I need to transfer money from customer to merchant account so I'm using old MPL SDK with adaptive payments. All works. Now I need to verify payment on server side. For this I'm using <code>PaymentDetails</code> API method (<a href="https://developer.paypal.com/docs/classic/api/adaptive-payments/PaymentDetails_API_Operation/" rel="nofollow">API reference</a>). But it always returns an error:</p>  <pre><code>Authentication failed. API credentials are incorrect. </code></pre>  <p>I've created an application on <a href="http://www.paypal-apps.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.paypal-apps.com</a> and requested API credentials in my PayPal profile. I've tried it with premier and business accounts. But still no results.</p>
