<p>I've read through PayPal's URL Paramenters for generating a payment link. However I seem to be having an issue whilst redirecting the user. I am taken to PayPal's homepage as if I have redirected the user to <a href="https://www.paypal.com" rel="nofollow">https://www.paypal.com</a> which I have not. I will leave my code below...</p>  <pre><code>//Error Checking //Min Payment &amp; Max Payment ... if($payment_amount&gt;10.00) { ...  //Redirect User for Payment $paypal_email = $email; $return_url = $sso_url."/myaccount/payments/success"; $cancel_url = $sso_url."/myaccount/payments/cancel"; $notify_url = $sso_url."/servlet/gateway/PayPal-IPN.Event.php";  $payment_url  ="cmd=_xclick&amp;business=$paypal_email&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;no_shipping=1&amp;amount=$payment_amount&amp;item_name=Service+Payment+My+Account&amp;return=$return_url&amp;cancel_url=$cancel_url"; $payment_url  = "https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?".rawurlencode(utf8_encode($payment_url));  header("Location: $payment_url"); exit(); </code></pre>  <p>Code runs with no errors, but then I'm redirected to the PayPal homepage, and I can't seem to find why?</p>  <blockquote>   <p><strong>Link that my script generates</strong></p>      <p><a href="https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd%3D_xclick%26business%3Dsales%40domain.com%26currency_code%3DGBP%26no_shipping%3D1%26amount%3D15.00%26invoice%3D001MyAccount%26item_name%3DMyAccount%26return%3D%2F%2Fid.mydomain.com%2Fmyaccount%2Fpayments%2F%3FPayPal_Response%3Dsuccess%26cancel_url%3D%2F%2Fid.mydomain.com%2Fmyaccount%2Fpayments%2F%3FPayPal_Response%3Dcancel" rel="nofollow">https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd%3D_xclick%26business%3Dsales%40domain.com%26currency_code%3DGBP%26no_shipping%3D1%26amount%3D15.00%26invoice%3D001MyAccount%26item_name%3DMyAccount%26return%3D%2F%2Fid.mydomain.com%2Fmyaccount%2Fpayments%2F%3FPayPal_Response%3Dsuccess%26cancel_url%3D%2F%2Fid.mydomain.com%2Fmyaccount%2Fpayments%2F%3FPayPal_Response%3Dcancel</a></p> </blockquote>
