<p>I am very new to paypal integration, i have gone through some tutorials but i still don't have a clear idea about what to do and overcoat if it is possible.</p>  <p>I have a website with ASP.NET Identity and basically, what i want to do, is to take member email (which is also a paypal email) and send him some amount.</p>  <p>So my question, is it possible to use just an email address to send money over paypal or should they provide me more information ?</p>
