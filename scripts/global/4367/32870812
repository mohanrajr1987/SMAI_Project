<p>I dont get the idea. If Classic api have DoExpressCheckout methods... what Rest API have for it? On that image we have the way how it should work for classic way <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ae4x9.gif" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ae4x9.gif" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>So for my case Express Checkout steps are: 1) Customer put items in cart and click on PayPal checkout button I run </p>  <pre><code>var payment = new PayPal.Api.Payment(); var createdPayment = payment.Create(apiContext); </code></pre>  <p>so make the payment and redirect customer to paypal site</p>  <p>2) Customer go thu the paypal process and return back to my site. From his pay pal transaction I should get Shipment address and his email (without submit that payment!) and based on his shipment address calculate shipment cost</p>  <p>3) After customer select shipment method I need update his transaction (add shipment cost) and only then sumbit it.</p>  <p>So the questions here</p>  <p>1) how to get payment (transaction) info with C# lib based on paymentId (like PAY-21A17783AU475540MKYGAM5Q) because PayPal.Api.Payment() have methods only Creare, Execute and Update?</p>  <p>2) How to Update current transaction (add some new data like shipment cost) and then submit it?</p>  <p>PS. In the documents a lot of mess and a lot of people dont understand how they should use that api properly.</p>  <p>Duke</p>
