<p>I have set up all of the PayPal buttons on a client's web site successfully and everything works EXCEPT for two issues with cancelling an order.</p>  <p>1) Situation: A user puts an item in his cart and goes to PayPal to proceed.  He then decides to cancel his order by clicking the cancel and return to... link.  When he then clicks the View Cart button the items he cancelled are still in his cart.  How do I get the cancel order feature to work correctly and completely cancel the users order by emptying his cart?</p>  <p>2) Situation: When the user clicks View Cart and the cart is empty, there is no cancel and return link (which is proper since there is no order to cancel.  However when a user has items in his cart and removes them, after removing the last item the cancel and return link does not go away like it should.  How do I fix that?</p>  <p>THANKS!</p>
