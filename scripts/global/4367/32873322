<p>I set up a PayPal account and want to add some sandbox accounts, but after creating business or personal accounts I get a message telling me my "Request is still processing, please wait..." when I try to access the profiles of each of them. This hasn't changed for four days now. I have set up test accounts last week using another e-mail/PayPal account and everything worked fine, I just can't figure out what's up, can anybody give me a hint?</p>
