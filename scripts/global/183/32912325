<p>I am trying to setup IIS Client Certificate Mapping Authentication and so far I have been unsuccessful. </p>  <ol> <li>I have a valid client authentication certificate </li> <li>I disabled all authentication methods in the Authentication feature of IIS for the target website</li> <li>Using the configuration editor I setup iisClientCertificateMappingAuthentication as documented in various sources. In this series of screen we map a domain account to a certificate. This is done by exporting the certificate to a text file, removing the first and last line and making sure all is in one line.</li> </ol>  <p>The problem is as follows:</p>  <p>When I try browsing to a test page, browser correctly prompts for selection of a certificate. I select the correct certificate. I then get presented with </p>  <p>HTTP Error 401.2 - Unauthorized You are not authorized to view this page due to invalid authentication headers.</p>  <p>If I enable Anonymous Authentication then it works, but the user is not the one in the mapping it is the user running the browser. I know this because the test page contains the following:</p>  <p>response.write (request.servervariables("LOGON_USER")) response.write (request.servervariables("AUTH_USER"))</p>  <p>So the questions are:</p>  <ol> <li>For IIS Client Certificate Mapping Authentication, is this the only authentication feature that needs to be enabled?</li> <li>Do we need to use the Authorisation feature to limit the users to the one provided in the mapping? </li> </ol>  <p>What I am trying to achieve is that only clients that have the certificate will be able to access the service. </p>  <p>What am I missing?</p>  <p>Cheers</p>  <p>Jose</p>
