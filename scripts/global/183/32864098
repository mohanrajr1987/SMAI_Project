<p>I've been following a tutorial that sets up simple user authentication. The following code is used to determine if a user is logged in:</p>  <pre><code>  def current_user     @current_user ||= User.find(session[:user_id]) if session[:user_id]   end </code></pre>  <p>If all I wanted to do was to ensure the user is logged in (and don't require anything from the user model), could I use something like:</p>  <pre><code>def is_user_logged_in    true if session[:user_id] end </code></pre>  <p>This way I wouldn't have to hit the database if all I wanted to do was check if the user is logged in. Does that look correct? And if so, are there any security concerns?</p>
