<p>I have a user class for my server:</p>  <pre><code>class User():     def __init__(self, username, password, group, join_date):         self.password = password         self.group = group         self.join_date = join_date </code></pre>  <p>I also have a dictionary with user ID's as the keys. The format for adding a user would be:</p>  <pre><code>users = {     1443: User("Bob", "my_password", "admin", "June 23") } </code></pre>  <p>My problem is when users log in to their account:</p>  <pre><code>username = input() password = getpass.getpass() </code></pre>  <p>I wanted to have something like:</p>  <pre><code>if username in users:     if users[username].password == password </code></pre>  <p>I can't do this because I don't know how I can get the user ID from the username of the user since it is embedded in an object. Any ideas or recommendations? I am new to authentication/authorization.</p>
