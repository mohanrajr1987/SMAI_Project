<p>i have a phonegap app and i want only <strong>my app users</strong> to access the api from where i am getting the data.</p>  <p>I am using php as my back end.</p>  <p>What i did was i created a key and was authenticating the key on the server. But the key is hard-coded in the app meaning someone can look at the code and figure out the key and pass it as a parameter and gain access to my api which i don't want.</p>  <p>Furthermore the key also be seen by using a proxy.</p>  <p>is there a way to dynamically generate the key on both the app and the server so it gets authenticated? Or some other way.</p>  <p><strong>i don't</strong> want the user to give any kind of username/password.</p>  <p><strong>i don't</strong> want the user to register or login..the user has no role in the authentication..i am authenticating the <strong>app</strong>.</p>
