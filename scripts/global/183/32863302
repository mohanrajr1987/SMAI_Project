<p>I am using sentinel by Ryan Durham <a href="https://github.com/rydurham/Sentinel" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/rydurham/Sentinel</a> with Laravel 5.1.</p>  <p>I used to use Confide <a href="https://github.com/Zizaco/confide" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/Zizaco/confide</a> with Larvel 4.2.</p>  <p>With Confide I was able to add an auth to any route like this</p>  <pre><code>// Applies auth filter to the routes within orders/  Route::when('orders/*', 'auth'); </code></pre>  <p>I've searched through Sentinel documentation for this feature but I cannot find out how to get this done. I can put an auth for say <code>admin</code> or <code>user</code> in the construct of a controller, but I need to have specific auth abilities on specific routes.</p>  <p>My question is, how can I redirect a <code>user</code> who goes to a route only for <code>admin</code> using rydurham sentinel in a clean fashion the same as Confide?</p>
