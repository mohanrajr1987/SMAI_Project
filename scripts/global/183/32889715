<p>I am trying to Build Single Sign on ASP.NET application, My Requirement is Web Application is Published in Local IIS Server, When Client Machine (Application Access Machine) has Active directory user then automatically logged into application because he/she already logged into their PC.. When the user is does not exist in an Active directory then needs to display the login page.</p>  <p><strong>Here what i had done now,</strong></p>  <p>We unable to access client credentials unless the application is windows authentication based, So I have created an intermediate windows authentication application, it will redirect into Forms Authentication Login Page where my original application resides... For automatic login we need to set Intranet Zone in IE Browser I have done that as of now Automatic login for Active directory user is working fine.</p>  <p><strong>Current Problem</strong></p>  <p>When the client machine not connected with Active directory users, He tries to access the Intermediate application (Windows Authentication), If Auto login failed, I need to redirect into Login Screen (Forms Authentication application), But currently It popup Authentication Required! It's asking for user credentials. The client does not know about IIS Server user details, so unable to access my site through windows authentication application.</p>  <p><em>If there is any way to achieve above functionality, (If active directory user -> Automatically logged into application, if not redirect to login page). Please advice I am in hard position now.</em></p>
