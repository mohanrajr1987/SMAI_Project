<p>I need some guidance on how to configure oAuth authentication against something else than Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn etc.</p>  <p>I have a consumer key and secret. And I can test this (in f.ex fiddler) to base 64 encode the key and secret so I get back an access token with an expire time. Then I guess this token have to be localy stored somehow? In a Cookie prob?</p>  <p>And use this cookie to authorize and if it has expired then get a new token etc.</p>  <p>Is it any good guide on how to set up this in the Startup.Auth class?</p>
