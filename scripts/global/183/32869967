<p>I have been researching this topic for a while without much luck.</p>  <p>Scenario: 1. Login to a Web Application with using standard form authentication. 2. Login from the Web Application to a SAML Relying Party.</p>  <p>Issue: I thought about using an iFrame to perform the authentication to the SAML Relying Party. The fundamental issue in this approach is that after finalizing the SAML authentication flow, I need to transfer a persistent authentication token back to my Web Application client (this token is used for subsequent access of my Web Application to the SAML relying party). </p>  <h1>. Can someone comment on whether this is the right approach (security wise)?</h1>  <h1>. Is there an alternative approach for authenticating web based clients to a system configured as a SAML relying party?</h1>  <p>Thanks in advance,</p>  <p>Saimon</p>
