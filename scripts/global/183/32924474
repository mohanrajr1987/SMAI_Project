<p>I'm looking for a way to handle the whole management of user accounts in Polymer. That includes the following features:</p>  <ul> <li>sign in</li> <li>sign up</li> <li>forgot password</li> <li>reset password</li> <li>change password</li> <li>social sign-in via Facebook</li> <li>social sign-in via Google</li> <li>high security</li> </ul>  <p>Meteor has a package available for this, more details: <a href="http://useraccounts.meteor.com/" rel="nofollow">http://useraccounts.meteor.com/</a></p>  <p>I'm wondering how others have solved this common problem. I couldn't find an element for all this, maybe someone has built a custom one.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance. Sorry if I don't explain everything in the right terms, my experience with front-end is very limited.</p>
