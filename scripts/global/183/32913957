<p>Newbie here - trying to get a good clean user auth implementation going with firebase and angularjs.</p>  <p>I started with this: <a href="https://github.com/firebase/angularfire-seed" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/firebase/angularfire-seed</a> And am trying to update the user auth to what is shown here: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/firebase/a221m6pb/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/firebase/a221m6pb/</a></p>  <pre><code>var controllers = {}; </code></pre>  <p>(attaching code here only to satisfy the stack overflow requirement - no idea why this is necessary)</p>  <p>...because the latter supports multiple login methods and has a nice look/feel.</p>  <p>I'm having trouble figuring out how to set up the multiple controllers in the second pkg to work with the ng-view structure set up in the first. I'm pretty sure I could refactor this by creating a new page (url) for each of the login functions - one controller per page - but that seems like a crude way to go.</p>  <p>There is also a fireuser repo on github which seems to do what I need, but it is based on simple login, which is deprecated. I have not been able to find any info on how one might migrate from simple login to the latest firebase authentication - maybe this would be the easiest way to get going. (?)</p>  <p>I will eventually need three different types of users all with different permissions on the site. They need to be able to access a different set of pages, and add different data to the DB.</p>  <p>Any suggestions welcome.</p>
