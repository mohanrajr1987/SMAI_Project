<p>I am new in ASP.NET Membership. And I want to implement ASP.NET Membership in ASP.NET MVC project. I am not sure is it possible or not.</p>  <p>Whenever we going to create MVC application at that time we found option for change authentication(no authentication, identity authentication, organization etc.). I've select identity authentication and get those tables in my application. <strong>look attached.</strong></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ogars.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ogars.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>But I don't want ASP.NET Identity table and functionality. </p>  <p>I want ASP.NET Membership table and functionality(user CRUD operations, assign role, change user password etc) <strong>look attached</strong>.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/gyjcb.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/gyjcb.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I have found the way for create ASP.NET Membership table in SQL Server.</p>  <ol> <li>Go to directory C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319 Click</li> <li>aspnet_regsql.exe. You will see the following screen.</li> </ol>  <p>But do you remember whenever we create MVC application with identity then they provide registration and login functionality inbuilt(no need to write code for that) yeah same, I want in ASP.NET Membership too.</p>  <p>Your answer will appreciable! :)</p>  <p>Thanks in advance :)</p>
