<p>I'm working on an app that fetches data from the network. I use <code>JSoup</code> to get HTML and then load it into my <code>WebView</code>. The problem looks like this:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/M9Nx2m.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/M9Nx2m.png" alt="enter image description here"></a> <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/UWj1em.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/UWj1em.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Whenever it loads tables they move the whole <code>View</code> and I get an undesirable picture. My question is: How do I make the <code>tables</code> look like a separate slidable piece? Something similar is done in the <code>StackExchange</code> mobile app (with the code blocks). And the second question is how do I make <code>tables</code> look a bit nicer? I mean outlines and borders</p>
