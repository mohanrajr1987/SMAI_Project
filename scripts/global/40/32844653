<p>For example in the controller I have the following query: </p>  <pre><code>a= db().select(db.my_db.ALL) </code></pre>  <p>How can I add in view a button, such that in real time it shows only the rows which have the field a.date bigger than the date that is selected by the user. I have seen that I can use ajax to refresh the table in real time, but I don't know how to add the button with the date.</p>  <p>Does anyone have an idea?</p>
