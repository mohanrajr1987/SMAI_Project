<p>I want to create a website using python without cms system, that is, say no to Django, Plesk, and the etc. I want to use fusion table to do sql search on page urls. And print out html and JavaScript files to the public  folder by python. I don't mind to reinvent the wheel. What is the strategy here. Can someone point to me to some web which implements this. Simply use google api as an interface. I also consider create a json server and use my own api to get and post data if fusion table api is limited. However it's not at this stage. I simply don't like the idea of cms. Basically, you can not change specific page's layout in cms. Why is it so prevalent? Can someone give me some guidance here. Another reason cms is bad is because of size limit. Database is a file. How big can a file be? 16Tb is the limit possibly. I am aiming for 1000Tb with 100 millions pages here.</p>
