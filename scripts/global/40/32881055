<p>The problem</p>  <p>Im using buddypress for wordpress it has a table for private messages in side which are thread ids for message threads. Currently theres no limit on how many messages can be in a thread. </p>  <p>I want to create a command that deletes all but the most recent 10 messages in a thread. Below is the logic, but im not sure the correct syntax to do it?</p>  <p>Any of you mysql geniuses know the answer? Big very big thanks in advance. </p>  <p><code>DELETE FROM TABLEA WHERE id = X</code> <strong><em>delete everything with thread ID x</em></strong></p>  <pre><code>EXCEPT  (SELECT * FROM TABLEA WHERE id = X ORDER BY date_sent DESC LIMIT 10)  </code></pre>  <p><strong><em>Selects most recent 10 i do not wish deleted.</em></strong></p>
