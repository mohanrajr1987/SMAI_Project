<p>I want to use javascript (using react.js also) to make a simple converter program with preset values.</p>  <p>I need to:</p>  <ol> <li>Find a value in the first column matching the inputted value</li> <li>Go along the row by one and take the value from this cell.</li> </ol>  <p>For example with this table,</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/PYvrz.gif" rel="nofollow">http://i.stack.imgur.com/PYvrz.gif</a></p>  <p>I would like to enter "4" and get the values of Color, and maybe the other columns.</p>  <p>How could I do this and is there any easier way?</p>
