<p>I have a set of data for which I need to generate multiple sets of regression coefficients. It is about 3 years of monthly energy consumption for ~1100 facilities. I need to generate coefficients for each facility and each year. The data is in an Excel table so I can update it monthly and pull reports from it.</p>  <p>Since it is in a table I cannot use array Enter, which also means I cannot use LINEST. It has 2 X's, which means unless I'm mistaken I can't use SLOPE or INTERCEPT either.</p>  <p>How can I generate the coefficients in the table? I am guessing it will require some kind of conditional matrix functions, or compiling the coefficients on a separate sheet and referring to them in the table.</p>
