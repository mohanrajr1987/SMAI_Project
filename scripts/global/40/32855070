<p>I developed a software using vb and SQL Server 2005 and I need to have a user permissions control, what is the best way to save in SQL Server the permissions and then get it?</p>  <p>I have a example something like that inside a column in SQL Server</p>  <pre><code>B?C?D?D?F?F?H?H?J?J?L?L?N?O?P?Q?R?R?T?T?V?V?W?X?Y?[? </code></pre>  <p>but I haven't found a way to separate this permissions by modules</p>
