<p>I have a class <code>Car</code>, with some atributtes <code>Model</code> and <code>Year</code>. I have a list (<code>List&lt;Car&gt; carList = new List&lt;Car&gt;()</code>) of some objects of the class <code>Car</code>, and I want to put this list into an HTML tag , but I have no idea how to do this.</p>  <p>I got a template that already has a <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>, that's why I'm trying to use <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> instead of <code>&lt;asp:GridView&gt;</code>.</p>  <p>I'm using WebForms</p>
