<p>I am testing an ETL load at the moment and want to create a temporary table that combines a number of rules so that I can do a minus against this temp table and the actual loaded table. I've tried various things but keep getting the same message stating "FROM keyword is not found where expected" My mentor is off on holiday and would appreciate if someone can offer me some assistance.</p>  <pre><code>Create table tbl_HT_CUST_PHNUM_TEMP as Select a.CONT_ID as CONT_ID,  a.TELEPHONE_NO as TELEPHONE_NO,  ROW_ID IS NULL, STATUS_ID IS NULL,  SystemTableID IS NULL,  INITIAL_POPULATION_TS as INITIAL_POPULATION_TS, BUSINESS_DATE_EXT as BUSINESS_DATE_EXT,  UPDATE_DATE_TIME as UPDATE_DATE_TIME, DATE_ENDED as DATE_ENDED CUSTOMERMAPPINGKEY IS NULL from &lt;schema&gt;.tbl_HT_CUST_PHNUM a; </code></pre>
