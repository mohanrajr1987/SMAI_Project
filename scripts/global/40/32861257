<p>I have been looking into how to create a pre defined view on a table every time it is created within SQL Server. </p>  <p>A nightly job truncates the database and recreates the schema so I would be looking to create the view then. I know the table name and the structure so I though this is possible.</p>  <p>The way I have been trying to achieve this is though DDL triggers but I cant seem to get it working. Any help or steer on what to look at next would be greatly appreciated.</p>
