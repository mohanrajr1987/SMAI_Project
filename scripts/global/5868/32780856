<p>I am trying to call an api made with Django Rest Framework <code>drf</code>. My case is that I want to call the api from another view get the response and display the data in a template. I have referred to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26790981/how-to-programatically-call-a-django-rest-framework-view-within-another-view">this SO post</a>, but could not make a successful call since my viewset requires authentication. Viewset works perfect if called using urls, the default way. Viewset is as below</p>  <pre><code>class ViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):     """     API endpoint that allows Objects to be viewed or edited.     """     permission_classes = (permissions.IsAuthenticated,)     queryset = Myclass.objects.all()     serializer_class = MyclassSerializer     ....     ....     return response(json) </code></pre>  <p>On calling this api from another view the response that I get is a <code>401 page</code> from drf api.</p>  <pre><code> ipdb&gt;view = Myview.as_view({'get':'list'}  ipdb&gt;obj=view(request, *args, **kwargs)  ipdb&gt; obj.data  {u'detail': u'Authentication credentials were not provided.'}  ipdb&gt;obj.has_header('Authentication')  False  </code></pre>  <p>I tried passing Authentication headers also, but I dont know whether its the right way.</p>  <pre><code>  view = MyViewSet.as_view({'get':'list'},{'token':'token'}) </code></pre>  <p>This returned an error argument token is not accepted. And I tried</p>  <pre><code>view = MyViewSet.as_view({'get':'list'},Authentication={'token':'token'}) </code></pre>  <p>But this Also returned me errors. How is it possible to call an api viewset from another view by passing auth params? </p>  <p>TIA</p>
