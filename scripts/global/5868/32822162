<p><br> I'm stack in a problem. I used ionic to create my app. My app have multi slide-box. The number of slide-box depend my service.  <br> For example. My service define three slidebox like that</p>  <pre><code>"slide-categories": [   {      "id": "1",      "name": "avc"   },   {      "id": "2",      "name": "bbbbbbb"   },   {      "id": "3",      "name": "sdf"   },   {      "id": "4",      "name": "dg"   },   {      "id": "5",      "name": "dfg"   } </code></pre>  <p>],    "status": "1"</p>  <p>and when my app run, I will look in a service and show the number of slide-box. All of view of slide-box is the same of style. That mean, I just have a view for whole of slide-box. But the problem is, I don't know how to create dynamic controller for single slide-box.</p>
