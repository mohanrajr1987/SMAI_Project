<p>Considering a simple view like:</p>  <pre><code>JOB    TYPE    DAYS  1      A       10  2      B       2  3      A       6  4      C       8 </code></pre>  <p>I want to add a new column (which do not exist on the original table), called ADP. This column will be filled with values depending on the TYPE column. If that value is A, then ADP column will be filled with a <code>CMM</code> value, if its B with a <code>CM</code>, and if it's C with a <code>PMM</code> value.</p>  <p>The result would be like that:</p>  <pre><code> JOB    TYPE    DAYS    ADP   1      A       10     CMM    2      B       2      CM   3      A       6      CMM   4      C       8      PMM </code></pre>
