<p>Unlike ListView, the Android RecyclerView seems way too complicated to implement. Since there is no OnItemClickListener for RecyclerView child, I've been trying to implement the following to register click events:</p>  <pre><code>final RecyclerView rv=(RecyclerView)findViewById(R.id.recycler_view);     LinearLayoutManager llm=new LinearLayoutManager(this);     rv.setLayoutManager(llm);     MyRVAdapter rva=new MyRVAdapter(persons);     rv.setAdapter(rva);      rv.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {         @Override         public void onClick(View v) {             int itemPosition = rv.indexOfChild(v);             Log.d("Tag", String.valueOf(itemPosition));         }     }); </code></pre>  <p>For some reason, I'm unable to get this code to work. The click event is not registered at all! Can anybody please tell me what am I doing wrong? I've seen some of the solutions, but I thought this is supposed to work. Thanks for your help!</p>
