<p>This is my code in my model, I want to use the variable <strong>lat</strong> to my view. Is there a way to use it there? </p>  <p>The string has a lat and lng with it. What I want to happen is when the string is selected in the text the lat and lng is selected as well but it will be stored in the variable and I will use it in the view and pass it to the script where it will view it in the google map api. </p>  <pre><code> public IEnumerable&lt;String&gt; GetStartList()             {                 //int count = 0;                 var result = new List&lt;String&gt;(10);                 string query = "SELECT PlaceName, Lat, Lng from Places";                 SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(query, con);                 con.Open();                 using (SqlDataReader dr = cmd.ExecuteReader())                 {                     while (dr.Read())                     {                         var mystring = dr.GetString(0);                         var lat = dr.GetDouble(1);                         result.Add(mystring);                         //result.Add(lat.ToString());                         //count++;                      }                 }                 con.Close();                 return result;             } </code></pre>
