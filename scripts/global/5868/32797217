<p>I have 2 tables and need to make a <strong>View</strong> table</p>  <p>These are 2 tables that I have:</p>  <ol> <li><strong>user</strong> table with some fields: id, username, email, pass</li> <li><strong>system_log</strong> table with 2 fields: uid, message (uid means user_id)</li> </ol>  <p>Now, I'd like to have a <strong>view table</strong> which gives me a table with 2 fields, <strong>username</strong> and <strong>message</strong>. </p>  <p>Here is my problem: I need <strong>username</strong> from <strong>user</strong> table in my <strong>view</strong> table while I have <strong>uid</strong> in my <strong>system_log</strong> table. Basically, instead of having <strong>uid</strong>, I need the <strong>username</strong></p>  <p>The project and list of fields in the actual project are more than these but I just made it simple here to make my points clear.</p>
