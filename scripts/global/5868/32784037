<p>I want to start programming OpenGl on OS. I have an NSOpenGLView which calls the drawRect function and paints a triangle on the view. </p>  <p>like it is explained on the mac developer library ("Drawing to a Window or View").</p>  <p>But it is only called once, and i want it to call it the hole time (60/sec) for animation. I think I have to do something with the context, but I don't know what. </p>  <p>It would really be helpful if someone could help me with setting up the window correctly. And is this a good way or should I look of creating the window with SDL or GLEW?</p>
