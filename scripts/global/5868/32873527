<p>I've checked <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2834016/how-to-get-a-list-of-mysql-views">this</a> topic before asking, and I found it was helpful just in a certain point, and now it's not enough.</p>  <p>I have a lot of databases in a MariaDB server, and one of the registered views is broken, giving me "Invalid references" error.</p>  <p>What I need is to find out what View is broken, considering that this error is preventing me to run my Backup routine, and MariaDB log shows only "Database (Got error: 1049) (Locktable)"</p>  <p>Now that I have a list of my views, is there any way to "select *" all of them, in different databases?</p>  <p>I've tried something like this:</p>  <pre><code>select *  from TABLE_SCHEMA where (select TABLE_SCHEMA,TABLE_NAME from information_schema.tables where TABLE_TYPE like 'VIEW'); </code></pre>  <p>But I know it will not work since I'm not providing a specific database.</p>  <p>I think a Inner-Join would solve this case, but I can't figure out how to accomplish it...</p>  <p>By the way, if there's a better approach to find what View is defective, I would appreciate it.</p>  <p>Thank you in advance!</p>
