<p>I am using Oracle Database</p>  <p>I have View called <code>VW_StockOpname</code></p>  <p>It has columns as follows : </p>  <pre><code>S1_KL S2_JB S3_NB S4_SB </code></pre>  <p>It has data consists of numbers.</p>  <pre><code>S1_KL | S2_JB | S3_NB | S4_SB ----------------------------- 1     | 0     | 1     | 1     2     | 2     | 3     | 1 </code></pre>  <p>I would like to make another column so I can be easier to see the whole Code values</p>  <pre><code>ASSETCODE  --------- 1-0-1-1 2-2-3-1 </code></pre>  <p>I intended to use this following code : </p>  <pre><code>SELECT (ASSET_CODE AS (S1_KL ||'-'|| S2_JB ||'-'|| S3_NB ||'-'|| S4_SB))  FROM VW_STOCKOPNAME  </code></pre>  <p>to be added to <code>VW_STOCKOPNAME</code> </p>  <p>but how can I do it? as long as I know, View can't be altered. </p>  <p>Meanwhile, each of the column in the view comes from different table.</p>  <p>Your help will be much appreciated</p>
