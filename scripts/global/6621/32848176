<p>I'm trying to get a Facebook access token that never expires but I cannot manage to do it. Here is my steps:</p>  <p>1) Use Facebook graph explorer to generate a short live access token with the desired permissions (this token is valid for 1h or so)</p>  <p>2) Get a long live token (2 months expiry time) by manual GET request to <a href="https://graph.facebook.com/oauth/access_token" rel="nofollow">https://graph.facebook.com/oauth/access_token</a>? grant_type=fb_exchange_token&amp; client_id=[app-client-id]&amp;client_secret=[app-secret-id]&amp; fb_exchange_token=[short-live-access-token]</p>  <p>3) An this tohttps://graph.facebook.com/[user-id]?fields=access_token&amp;access_token=[long-live-access-token]</p>  <p>but that last steps show an error:</p>  <pre><code>{   "error": {     "message": "(#100) Tried accessing nonexisting field (access_token) on node type (User)",     "type": "OAuthException",     "code": 100,     "fbtrace_id": "DpmM6CyzoAt"   } } </code></pre>  <p>I have found that last step somewhere on the net so I presume FB must have change something, I have read their api doc but I cannot figure out by what resource they chance the step 3. </p>  <p>Could someone explain me how to get a user access token that never expires ?</p>  <p>thank you</p>
