<p>Fairly new to javascript, I'm doing a personality quiz, so theres multiple endings. </p>  <p>I know to set up an array for my variables and an array to store user input, I've got the buttons set up radio style.  </p>  <p>Now the question is how does one go about setting up a point system based on user input that will display a specific answer at the end?  I just need some help being steered in the right direction! Thank you!  Also do I have to use eventListeners for the radio buttons?</p>
