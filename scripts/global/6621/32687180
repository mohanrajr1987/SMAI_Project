<p>I want to update my user Model with new tables, The tables being the following.  I need the user to be able to choose a location upon signing up.  I also need the users to be able to select up to 3 genres of music they'd prefer to listen to while signing up. </p>  <p>Now, The problem is I am going to let users select which genre they like, I also want them to be able to click on the genre link to see what other users on the website also enjoy that type of genre. So would that mean the genre would have to be a model while the location should be a table? </p>  <p>This is what I have in my user.rb, </p>  <pre><code>class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base     has_secure_password     before_save { self.email = email.downcase }     validates :first_name, :last_name,  presence: true, length: { maximum: 50 }     VALID_EMAIL_REGEX = /\A[\w+\-.]+@[a-z\d\-.]+\.[a-z]+\z/i     validates :email, presence: true, length: { maximum: 255 },     format: { with: VALID_EMAIL_REGEX },     uniqueness: { case_sensitive: false }     validates :first_name, :last_name, presence: true, uniqueness: true      validates_inclusion_of :age, in: 10..100     validates :password, presence: true, length: { minimum: 4 }, allow_nil:    true     has_many :posts     has_attached_file :profile_picture, :styles =&gt; { :medium =&gt; "300x300&gt;", :thumb =&gt; "100x100&gt;" },      :default_url =&gt; "app/assets/images/missing.png",      :path =&gt; ":rails_root/public/system/:class/:attachment/:id_partition/:style/:filename"      validates_attachment_content_type :profile_picture, :content_type =&gt; /\Aimage\/.*\Z/     def self.search(query)       where("email like ?", "%#{query}%")      end end </code></pre>  <p>If you guys need any other code just let me know, And thanks in advance!</p>
