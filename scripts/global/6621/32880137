<p>We have a test system and we want to add a automatically fill up it to the SQL the "Added By / Registered by: " depends on what Username he have.</p>  <p>We want to track who add this item.</p>  <p><strong>Example:</strong> My friend logged in to our system and he's ID number is admin05, so my friene will add new item. Our add item for consists of Item name &amp; item code. So I  fill it up and sumbit but I as the head admin I want to see in our database who add that item. </p>  <p><strong>*Another example:</strong>  We have 5 admins in our system 1 SuperAdmin(me) and 4 admins. Usually the 4 admins are the one who are in-charge in adding new items. So as superadmin If I see the list of all items I can see who add this products. </p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
