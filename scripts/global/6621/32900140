<p>It looks like this  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4307743/profile-model-for-devise-users">Profile model for Devise users?</a> but mine is different.</p>  <p>I want to create employee record and this employee have an option to have a user account or not. I am using devise gem for my user.</p>  <p>So I have Employee model with </p>  <pre><code>has_one :user accepts_nested_attributes_for :user </code></pre>  <p>and User model </p>  <pre><code>belongs_to :employee </code></pre>  <p>I know that I need to put nested user in my view, But how to save it in controller?</p>  <p>It is not something like this, right?</p>  <pre><code>params.require(:employee).permit(:name, user_attributes: [:email, :password]) </code></pre>  <p>Can you give some hint or some useful link I can follow? It is hard to modify the devise. Thank you ^_^</p>
