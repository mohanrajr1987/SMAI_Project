<p>I'm setting up a <code>proftpd</code> server but I've got a little problem with the user permissions. I can use the ftp and everything works perfect except for uploading files (STOR)... which is pretty bad because I need the server as a storage. I'm running Linux Raspbian (Debian). I hope that anyone can help me. Thanks</p>  <p>proftpd.conf:</p>  <pre><code># /etc/proftpd/proftpd.conf -- This is a basic ProFTPD configuration file. # To really apply changes, reload proftpd after modifications, if # it runs in daemon mode.
