<p>I have spent a little time trying and searching how to resend the confirmation email to my users in parse.com. I am using PHP SDK and I have tried:</p>  <pre><code>//Fisrt aproach: $user-&gt;SignUp(); //Again after signing up the first time  //Second aproach: $user1-&gt;destroy(); //But parse.com do not allow me to destroy an user $user2-&gt;setUsername($user); $user2-&gt;setPassword($password); $user2-&gt;SignUp(); </code></pre>
