<p>So I'm a bit new to coding and just needed direction, not necessarily doing it for me, but some steering. </p>  <p>I need to make a personality quiz that takes user choices and based on their choices gives them a certain outcome out of 4 choices at the end.</p>  <p>I know to create an array with questions and answers, but I'm not exactly clear what the next step is to set up a system to store user input.  </p>  <p>Do I use another array to store the data?<br> Does that array have to refer to the buttons I make or the array earlier?</p>  <p>I'm not even sure if that's the right steps, I just need some clarification to the next step I should take after I create an array of my questions and answers.</p>
