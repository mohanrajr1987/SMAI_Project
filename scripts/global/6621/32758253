<p>Is there anyway to create a customer programmatically like you can with a WordPress user. Obviously the WooCommerce user shares some of the same WordPress user fields, there there is additional content that would need to be set like Billing / Postal address.</p>  <p>Has anyone achieved this before? I can't find anything in the WooCommerce API / functions list on their website.</p>  <p>EDIT: Just found this: <a href="http://docs.woothemes.com/wc-apidocs/function-wc_create_new_customer.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.woothemes.com/wc-apidocs/function-wc_create_new_customer.html</a></p>  <p>But how can I then provide other field details (like addresses).</p>
