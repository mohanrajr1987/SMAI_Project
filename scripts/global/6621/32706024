<p>I want to make a calculator that greets the user by name then multiplies one number that the user enters and one number that I set. For instance, if the user enters the number 10, I want my code to take the 10 and multiply it by 6. </p>  <p>Here's what I have so far:</p>  <pre><code>import java.util.Scanner;  public class Calculator {      public static void main(String[] args){          Scanner userInputScanner = new Scanner(System.in);          System.out.println ("Hello, my name is Bob. What is your name?");          String userName = userInputScanner.nextLine();          System.out.println ("Hello" + userName +  "how many steps do you take in a ten second interval?");     } } </code></pre>  <p>This part is working, but I can't figure out what to do next.</p>
