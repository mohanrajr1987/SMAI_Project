<p>here is my problem, i got a batch code that finds files named a specific string. I want it to check for the availability of a directory, continue to  wait and the loop to search again, unless a user wants to stop it. here is the line i want help with</p>  <pre><code>::some code here if exist %directory% timeout /t %delay% &amp; goto :search  </code></pre>  <p>:: this checks if the directory exists and continues to loop if it does. the problem is that it only comes out of the loop if the directory is not there, i want it so that the user can make it stop. How do i do that(without pressing the ctrl+c sequence)?</p>
