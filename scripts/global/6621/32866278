<p>I have a User Control which contains 4 labels.  I populate a panel dynamically with multiple copies of this user control (one for each entry in a database).  I want to capture a click event on any one of the user controls and grab the id associated with it. </p>  <p>The is the code contained within my user control:</p>  <pre><code>public partial class TeamVsTeam: UserControl {     public TeamVsTeam()     {         InitializeComponent();     }      public int eventID { get; set; }     public int idHomeTeam { get; set; }     public int idAwayTeam { get; set; } } </code></pre>  <p>Within my application, I populate a panel with multiple controls like this:</p>  <pre><code>TeamVsTeam.TeamVsTeam[] teamLabel = new TeamVsTeam.TeamVsTeam[n];  for (int i = 0; i &lt; m_fixtures.lstTeams.Count; i++) {     teamLabel[i] = new TeamVsTeam.TeamVsTeam();      teamLabel[i].eventID = m_fixtures.lstTeams[i].idEvent;      teamLabel[i].lblHome.Text = m_fixtures.lstTeams[i].homeTeam.ToString();     teamLabel[i].lblAway.Text = m_fixtures.lstTeams[i].awayTeam.ToString();      teamLabel[i].Clicked += new EventHandler(Fixture_Click);     //Location     teamLabel[i].Top = 80 * i;     teamLabel[i].Parent = panel1; } </code></pre>  <p>Is anyone able to suggest some code which I can use to capture the click event (anywhere on the user control) and obtain the <code>eventID</code>, <code>homeTeam</code> and <code>awayTeam</code> from the control which was clicked? </p>  <pre><code>    public void Fixture_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)     {         var ctrl = ((TeamVsTeam.TeamVsTeam)sender);         int ID = ctrl.eventID;         MessageBox.Show(ID.ToString());     } </code></pre>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong> I've updated the above code to show what I'm now working with, however, it's not completely solved things for me. </p>  <p>Here's an example of a fully populated user control (3 labels and 2 picture boxes)</p>  <p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/0tidlarzfoy6j2u/2015-09-30%2015_48_35-Super-6.jpg?dl=0" rel="nofollow">https://www.dropbox.com/s/0tidlarzfoy6j2u/2015-09-30%2015_48_35-Super-6.jpg?dl=0</a></p>  <p>If I click on any of the light grey background, the click event is triggered and I can grab the fixture eventID. But the event is not triggered if I click on any of the labels or picture boxes.  I still need to capture the fixture eventID, regardless of what part of the control is clicked. Any ideas? </p>
