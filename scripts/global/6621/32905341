<p>Due to my app requeriments I need an hierachy of users classes like:</p>  <pre><code>class CommonUser(models.Model):     user = models.OneToOneField(User,on_delete=models.CASCADE)     photo = models.ImageField(upload_to="profileImages",blank=True,null=True)       #HERE: Common properties for every user     class Meta:         abstract = True  class Installer(CommonUser):     #HERE: Specific properties for Installer Companies   class Administration(CommonUser):     #HERE: Specific properties for Administration   class Client(CommonUser):     #HERE: Specific properties for Clients </code></pre>  <p>Well, in view.py I need to get the profile image for an user. I get the user by the request, so I have an models.User objects and I dont know to witch class it belong. Im not able to do:</p>  <p>request.user.commonuser.photo</p>  <p>because user object doesnt have any OnetoOne relation with commonuser but with installer/administration/client...</p>  <p>Any idea? Thanks!</p>
