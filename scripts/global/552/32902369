<p>I am using mono 3.2.8 and the default SGen to collect memory. I log every 10 mins the memory usage of my .NET 4.0 application and came to the following conclusion:</p>  <p>Memory is rising slowly till nearly no more free system memory is left (like 4MB). When it comes to this point, a big amount (like 10-20 MB) is collected at once.</p>  <p>Is there a way to control the frequency of the collection (more often), withought collecting it manually? </p>  <p>What could be the reason for this behaviour (in code and in GC)?</p>  <p>Thx for your help!</p>
