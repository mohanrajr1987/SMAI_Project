<p>I am using EventSource to log events in my library. That library is cross platform meaning it could be used by linux/mac users. I know how EventSource works on windows. Users can view default logs using tools like PerfView or Logman tool or implement EventListener class to direct logs to a different location.</p>  <p>But EventListener class is not available on mono. Where are the events logged by EventSource by default on linux/mac? Are there any tools available to view them?</p>  <p>Please let me know if more details are needed.</p>
