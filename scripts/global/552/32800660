<p>I am trying to use mono to compile C# but mono is returning the following errors:</p>  <pre><code>CS0246: the type or namespace name 'Font' could not be found ... CS0246: the type or namespace name 'Color' could not be found ... CS0246: the type or namespace name 'Color' could not be found ... </code></pre>  <p>My import statements look like this:</p>  <pre><code>using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Text; using System.Threading.Tasks; using System.Drawing; using System.Drawing.Font; using System.Drawing.Imaging; using System.IO; </code></pre>  <p>Any ideas? is the Font Class and Color Structure even supported in mono? I can't seem to find any documentation on what is officially supported and what is not if you could point me in the correct direction that would be great.</p>
