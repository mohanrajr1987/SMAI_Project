<p><em>Disclaimer: I've read all AWS doc, and the ubuntu/.net walkthroughs</em><br> <em>I've attempted to follow several different how-tos to do this, with no success</em><br> <em>As such, simply linking tutorials will most likely not solve my problem - I doubt I won't already have found it and tried it</em></p>  <p>I am attempting to host a .net website on an AWS Ubuntu apache server.<br> Apache is correctly installed and the default page works.<br> Having trouble testing anything other than the default.html (on AWS) I chose to continue with a personal Ubuntu VM.<br> (I've found a way to make a site the default one on AWS but figured I had better learn how to host a .net site on Ubuntu first)  </p>  <p><strong>On the VM::</strong><br> Mono is also installed, and I can access simple .aspx pages.<br> However when I attempt to open our hosted .net site ina browser I get a System.Web.Compilation.CompilationException error (CS1703:An assembly 'mscorlib' with the same identity has already been imported) I've found these:<br> <a href="https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=3582" rel="nofollow">https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=3582</a><br> <a href="https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=19044#c16" rel="nofollow">https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=19044#c16</a><br> that seemed related to my problem, however I'm still stuck. Getting rid of the mscorlib.dll in the /usr or /opt directory did nothing, getting rid of it in the /bin gave me a type error (as if mscorlib was no longer there. logical)</p>  <p>**The website works fine with IIS in windows. It is in .net 4.5 and has several project dlls referenced.</p>  <p>At this point I'm wondering if it might be a problem with Ubuntu, Mono, or the website. And I feel as though I've exhausted google as a resource (as surprising as that may be)</p>  <p>If anyone has hosted a .net 4.5 site on ubuntu (on AWS is a +) I could definitly use a few pointers.</p>
