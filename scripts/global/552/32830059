<p>I found this file <code>libMonoFuseHelper.so</code> among project <code>Mono.Fuse</code> files. What the hell does this thing do? It's a native binary so MonoDevelop cannot tell me anything about it. I do not understand what the C code is supposed to do at all.</p>  <p>The file can be found in  <a href="https://github.com/jonpryor/mono-fuse/tree/master/src/MonoFuseHelper" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/jonpryor/mono-fuse/tree/master/src/MonoFuseHelper</a></p>  <p><strong><em>Edit:</em></strong> I would like to reorganize the project from repository below which is basically a MonoDevelop solution that wraps all files up while Pryor's repository is a bunch of half-C half-CS code that I cannot even get through. So what is the problem? This .so is native code which is something that should not be part of a C# solution, if possible. So I am asking, what does it do anyway? And can I get rid of it somehow?</p>  <p><a href="https://github.com/ststeiger/FuseExample" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/ststeiger/FuseExample</a></p>
