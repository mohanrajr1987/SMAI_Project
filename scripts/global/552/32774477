<p>I'm trying to get EntityFramework 6 with dotConnect for Oracle working on Mono. I have also all app configuration defined in userSettings section.</p>  <p>First thing I noticed is that my app has always default configuration, then I tried to make Devart.Data.Oracle provider working, but I got an error:</p>  <pre><code>System.Configuration.ConfigurationErrorsException: Failed to find or load the registered .Net Framework Data Provider 'Devart.Data.Oracle'. </code></pre>  <p>I checked my app with <em>strace</em> and using MONO_LOG_LEVEL:</p>  <pre><code>MONO_LOG_LEVEL=debug mono Host.exe | grep config </code></pre>  <p>And config file is loaded (successfully) couple of times during app startup.</p>  <p>I found few bug reports about configuration in mono, but they are quite old and I don't know if still actual.</p>  <p><a href="https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=ApplicationSettingsBase+" rel="nofollow">https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=ApplicationSettingsBase+</a></p>  <p>Could you give me a hint how to get rid of provider section in App.config? I've managed to move almost all configuration to code (except of providers).</p>
