<p>I need to run my C#-based code on a server with Linux. I am using Visual Studio on my pc, but now I should switch to Mono on that server.  I have tried to test my code by running a single job with Mono. But there is a strange problem. When I run my code by directly using Visual Studio on my pc, everything is working well. Surprisingly, when I try the same thing on Linux, an "OutOfMemoryException" happens when the code is in a line to generate an array. The size of this array is (6,156 * 24,624), which is totally fine! I have arrays with similar size earlier in my code, and there is no "OutOfMemoryException" for them. </p>  <p>I would be grateful if anyone can help me to understand what is the main reason for this issue and how can I handle it?</p>
