<p>I have a main c# program running on a raspberry pi using mono, and another program that isn't mine, written in c that gets some Bluetooth info. </p>  <p>I've looked at a couple of ways of getting the Bluetooth info from the c program to the main c#. Turning the c program into a DLL seemed to be the best option. But I can't get it to compile using visual studio (can't get all the Linux .h files) or on the pi with gcc. </p>  <p>Does anyone have a good method of creating a dll for the pi, or a better way to pass data between programs or a way for mono to access bluetooth functions. As far as I know it can't do this?   </p>
