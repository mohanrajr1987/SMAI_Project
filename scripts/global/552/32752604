<p>I'm trying to write a mono app which handles user login/logout dbus events and I've managed to run it via terminal. Then i've created <code>.conf</code> file in <code>/etc/init</code> like this:</p>  <pre><code># test  description "System dbus listener"  start on startup stop on shutdown  respawn console log  exec /usr/bin/mono /usr/bin/listener.exe </code></pre>  <p>And it works if i remove all references to dbus (leaving only dummy console output). But when I try to actually use dbus, I get exception while performing <code>start listener</code>:</p>  <pre><code>Unhandled Exception: System.TypeInitializationException: An exception was thrown by the type initializer for DBus.Bus ---&gt; System.ArgumentNullException: Argument cannot be null. Parameter name: address   at DBus.Bus.Open (System.String address) [0x00000] in &lt;filename unknown&gt;:0    at DBus.Bus..cctor () [0x00000] in &lt;filename unknown&gt;:0    --- End of inner exception stack trace ---   at listener.MainClass.Main (System.String[] args) [0x00000] in &lt;filename unknown&gt;:0  </code></pre>  <p>So, it looks like something is not initialized or what not. When i simply launch app in terminal it works. Does anyone know how to owercome this?</p>  <p><strong>Edit</strong></p>  <p>The same exception rises when i try launching app with sudo, so it seems that DBus cannot open session bus (whose address is in env variable and thus cannot be accessed). But I don't use it, and don't want it to be opened (just for now however).</p>
