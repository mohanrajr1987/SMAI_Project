<p>I'm getting an incorrect path when using MakeRelativeUri. Now this could be an issue with Unity and mono or hopefully I'm just using it wrong or maybe there's actually a bug in .net. You'll have to forgive the elaborate example but this is what I have.</p>  <pre><code>System.Uri fileURI = new System.Uri( "/Home/Folder1/Folder2/Folder3/Folder4/Folder5/Folder6/../../../../Folder7/Folder8/file.png" ); System.Uri rootURI = new System.Uri( "/Home/Folder1/Folder2/Folder3/../FolderA/." ); result = rootURI.MakeRelativeUri( fileURI ).ToString(); </code></pre>  <p>result in this case is <code>../../Folder4/Folder5/Folder6/../../../../Folder7/Folder8/file.png</code></p>  <p>but it should be  <code>../Folder3/Folder4/Folder5/Folder6/../../../../Folder7/Folder8/file.png</code></p>  <p>It seems as though it is treating the ../ in the root path as a directory rather than an instruction to go back a directory. Can anyone confirm if thats the case?</p>
