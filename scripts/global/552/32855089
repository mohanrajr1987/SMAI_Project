<p>I have two Unity3D applications - one launched by the other, with a -batchmode argument on the launched one so it has no graphics.</p>  <p>On Mac OSX the launched process still gets a dock icon that sits there bouncing forever; clicking it does nothing since it's non-graphical, and I'd really like to remove it.</p>  <p>I've tried modifying the Info.plist with a LSUIElement entry to get rid of the dock icon. That works perfectly if I launch the application myself, but it still gets a dock icon when I launch it as a process.</p>  <p>My process launching code is a little unusual which mightn't be helping. This works on Windows and Linux but not OSX and I'm not sure why (C#, mono):</p>  <pre><code>ProcessStartInfo proc = new ProcessStartInfo(); proc.FileName = path + filename; proc.WorkingDirectory = path; proc.Arguments = commandlineFlags; process = Process.Start(proc); </code></pre>  <p>I've only got it to launch on OSX with this specific setup:</p>  <pre><code>ProcessStartInfo startInfo = new ProcessStartInfo("open", "-a '" + path + filename + "' -n --args " + commandlineFlags); startInfo.UseShellExecute = false; process = Process.Start(startInfo); </code></pre>
