<p>For example if a program has 3 opcodes that i want to remove like this : <a href="http://prntscr.com/8i20rm" rel="nofollow">http://prntscr.com/8i20rm</a></p>  <p>I want to make a program that automates this process without being needed to decompile to program...</p>  <pre><code>Dim ilp As ILProcessor = md.Body.GetILProcessor() Dim RemoveLdsfld As Instruction = Instruction.Create(OpCodes.Nop, 0) Dim RemoveLdstr As Instruction = Instruction.Create(OpCodes.Nop, 0) Dim RemoveCallvirt As Instruction = Instruction.Create(OpCodes.Nop, 0)  If inst.OpCode = OpCodes.[Ldsfld] Then  ilp.Remove(RemoveLdsfld) End If </code></pre>  <p>I think this code is like 101% bad (lol) but I also don't know how to work with mono.cecil really well, i just want to replace the codes with nop's or remove them from the code completely</p>
