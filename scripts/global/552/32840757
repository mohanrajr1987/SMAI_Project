<p>I downloaded the source code of the “System.Data.Services.Client” package from the site “ <a href="https://github.com/mono/mono" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/mono/mono</a> ”, but apparently the source code is not up-to-date, because I see that the “DataServiceContext” (source code: <a href="https://github.com/mono/mono/blob/master/mcs/class/System.Data.Services.Client/Client/System/Data/Services/Client/DataServiceContext.cs" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/mono/mono/blob/master/mcs/class/System.Data.Services.Client/Client/System/Data/Services/Client/DataServiceContext.cs</a> ) does not have all the members listed on the site “ <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.services.client.dataservicecontext(v=vs.113).aspx" rel="nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.services.client.dataservicecontext(v=vs.113).aspx</a> ”, such as “Format” or “DefaultResolveType”. What is the reason? Is there a way to get the current source code?</p>  <p>Is the “System.Data.Services.Client” package compatible with Xamarin.Forms? I need to solve the problem described in my question “ <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32690291/updating-a-record-in-an-odata-service-using-c-sharp">Updating a record in an OData service using C#</a> ” and the only idea that I currently have is to include the source code of the “System.Data.Services.Client” package in my solution in order to see what happens in the package.</p>
