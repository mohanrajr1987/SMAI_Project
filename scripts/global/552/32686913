<p>Currently I'm trying to record system lock/unlock events on linux, under mono c#. I was hoping to achieve this with the help of <code>dbus</code>, using different components on different desktop environments. And I was able to do so on Ubuntu with Unity, using <code>Ndesk.DBus</code> api, but it seems that there's no such signals on Xfce desktop. I've checked <code>dbus-monitor "type=signal"</code> there and it shows completely nothing useful on lock/unlock. So, is there any cross-desktop way to record system events (I also need login/logout and active window change)?</p>
