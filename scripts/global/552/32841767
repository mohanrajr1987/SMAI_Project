<p>I am new to c# and mono. and I encountered a strange question. I have 2 projects in my solution. and one is dependent on another one called CoreLogic. I've already set up the dependency and the compilation is successful. However, when I run it and sent it a request, the program throws an exception like:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>server Error: Could not load type 'Logic.RedisStorage' from assembly   'CoreLogic, Version=1.0.5750.32870, Culture=neutral,   PublicKeyToken=null'.</p> </blockquote>  <p>the strangest thing is that I can see the Logic.RedisStorage class is present in the assembly CoreLogic of xamarin studio. but the program still complains. So, what is wrong here? <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/PHAbB.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/PHAbB.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I've tried to re-add the dependency of CoreLogic, but it turns out no luck. here is what the mono has complained: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/GLTfU.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/GLTfU.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>the assembly version does match what server is dependent(I can not upload imgs right now, so check following link for detail):</p>  <p><a href="https://www.evernote.com/l/APWLUXOQa5pAxrm3MUZDhxZ88KkJ2Y5bhl0" rel="nofollow">https://www.evernote.com/l/APWLUXOQa5pAxrm3MUZDhxZ88KkJ2Y5bhl0</a></p>
