<p>I was tasked with rewriting a part of a large .NET solution. As a part of a major overhaul, I need to identify and recode classes, responsible for some specific related functionality. My boss wants to improve architecture [by applying a particular design pattern and replacing some of homemade classes with a well-known library]. There is no documentation of any kind, however, except for comments in the code. I generated docs with doxygen. It makes things a little simpler. Yet, it still leaves me with a task of figuring out how everything works.</p>  <p>I am looking for a tool that would help me to visualize/document my code execution graph. If there is a portable tool, which works on OSX, even better. Any advice?</p>  <p>Thank you</p>
