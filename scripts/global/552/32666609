<p>For a geospatial Xamarin-project I need SQLite/RTree-enabled.</p>  <p>With Mono.Data.SQLite it works for Xamarin.iOS, but not for Xamarin.Android (exception unknown module 'rtree'). Seems like  Mono.Data.SQLite is just a wrapper into the sqlite-lib of the OS and Android doesn't have rtree enabled but iOS has.</p>  <p>So I thought, why not compile my own version of the Mono.Data.SQLite with RTree-enabled ? So I tried <a href="https://system.data.sqlite.org/index.html/doc/trunk/www/build.wiki#mono" rel="nofollow">system.data.sqlite</a>, but this is again only creating a wrapper with no chance to enable RTree.</p>  <p>This is unfortunately beyond my skills, but should it not be possible to compile a dll for mono from system.data.sqlite-sources which is not just a wrapper, but also contains the sqlite.dll stuff with rtree-enabled  ?</p>
