<p>Is there a way to pass parameters to XSP from Monodevelop (ASP.NET debug session) ?</p>  <p>I'm using Monodevelop 5.9.6/mono 4.0.4 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and I'm trying to set root folder of XSP: <strong><em>--root PATH</em></strong> from <a href="http://the%20http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/jaunty/man1/fastcgi-mono-server.1.html">manpage</a>. </p>  <p>I know I could use xsp.exe.config to do that. However, that would mean to change the xsp user-wide configuration (since, IMHK, xsp.exe.config should be placed next to the xsp.exe and it is then shared for all invocation of xsp.exe). Maybe I missed something?</p>
