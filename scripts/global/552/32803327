<p>I have made an application using monodevelop on linux mint KDE 17.1</p>  <p>The target platform is .net 4.0 (if i switch to 2.0 the GTK won't work, and I don't know why, I'd like an answer for this as well).</p>  <p>The application runs on my computer when I run <code>mono app.exe</code>.</p>  <p>Let's suppose I have a fresh installation of linux mint. What packages will I need to install in order to run this app?</p>  <p>I've tried installing only mono-runtime but it wouldn't run.</p>  <p>Soooo?</p>
