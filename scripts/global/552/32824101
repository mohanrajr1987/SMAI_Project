<p>I'm trying to build the development branch for Monogame and it instructs you to execute "mono Protobuild.exe" to create the solution files.  I downloaded the github branch and in the terminal navigated to the file that the Protobuild.exe exists and then ran the command, but was given "command not found" when executed.  Does anyone know what I am doing incorrectly here?</p>  <p>I have downloaded the Mono SDK.</p>
