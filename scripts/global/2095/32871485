<p>I am working on an application in which simple mathematical expressions are passed around as strings (for example "2+3"). I need to execute these expressions to make sure they equal a target.</p>  <p>In Mathematica / Wolfram Language, one can convert strings to expressions with the simple command ToExpression[]. Is there anything equivalent in Swift? If not, how might one convert the string into workable math?</p>
