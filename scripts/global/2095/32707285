<p>I am new to Regular Expressions, my experience is next to nothing. I found some aid on coverting from 12 hour formats such as 8:00 PM to 20:00 hours but my query is slightly different. I am trying to convert time in the format:</p>  <pre><code>Mon-11:45 AM to 12 Midnight Tue-11:45 AM to 12 Midnight  Wed-11:45 AM to 12 Midnight  Thu-11:45 AM to 12 Midnight  Fri-11:45 AM to 12 Midnight  Sat-11:45 AM to 12 Midnight  Sun-11:45 AM to 12 Midnight </code></pre>  <p>And convert this to a 24 hour format where I am tagging days of the week with numbers. How do I write a regex that will extract this information, beacuse the problem I was facing was that when i write an expression to detect "Mon", I also detect "Midnight" or "Noon", so how do I make sure that "Mon" represents day and "Noon" the time of the day. [In some cases certain places are closed such as Tue-Closed]</p>  <p>Any help is appreciated. Thank you. </p>
