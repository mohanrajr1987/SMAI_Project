<p>I have an issue with an expression in SSRS</p>  <p><strong>Project</strong></p>  <blockquote>   <p>USE SSRS Expressions and custom code to encrypt, and then determine   target to hyperlink to based on environment.</p> </blockquote>  <p><strong>What we have accomplished</strong></p>  <blockquote>   <p>We have created a custom DLL using a custom library imported into the   References in Report properties</p>      <p>From within the Expression then we wrote Switch statement to determine   the target as follows:</p> </blockquote>  <p>Expression</p>  <pre><code>=Switch ( Globals.ReportServerUrl = "https://devportal2.xxx.com/sites/Co" , "https://stage.connect.com/secure/clr/er=" &amp; Code.EncryptRin(Fields!Member_Member_ID_.Value), Globals.ReportServerUrl = "https://testportal2.xxx.com/sites/Co" , "https://stage.connect.com/secure/clr/er=" &amp; Code.EncryptRin(Fields!Member_Member_ID_.Value), Globals.ReportServerUrl = "https://stageportal2.xxx.com/sites/Co" , "https://www.connect.com/secure/clr/er=" &amp; Code.EncryptRin(Fields!Member_Member_ID_.Value), Globals.ReportServerUrl = "https://stageportal2.xxx.com/sites/Co" , "https://www.connect.com/secure/clr/er=" &amp;  Code.EncryptRin(Fields!Member_Member_ID_.Value),true, "https://stage.connect.com/secure/clr/er=" + Code.EncryptRin(Fields!Member_Member_ID_.Value) ) </code></pre>  <p>Custom Code</p>  <pre><code>Public Function UserName() Try     Return Report.User!UserID   Catch     Return "System"   End Try End Function   Public Function EncryptRin(ByVal Rin as string) As String     Return Encryption.AESConsole.EncryptText(Rin) End Function </code></pre>  <p>In the above there are two functions one is not relevant and that's the Username() one. The second one is the part we need to encode.</p>  <p><strong>What I need help with</strong></p>  <p>We need to encode the encrypted portion of the URL before we can send it over. But I'm a little confused on WHERE this needs to happen.</p>  <p>So my understanding is I need to do this from the Expression because that's where we are referencing it. If that's not where it happens, what would the syntax look like to reference a parameter in the above function before it gets to the expression?</p>  <p>Has anyone done this? Help is much appreciated.</p>
