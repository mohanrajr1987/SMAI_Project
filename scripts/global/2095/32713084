<p>i have a report and the user has 2 text boxes if one text box is empty i want the other to not show anything  is there an expression to do so ? so if i have  no data in a calculated field then i don't want to show anything in the other box,  as currently it shows regardless if theirs data or not. ive tried looking at IfNothing but as this is  a condition baced on weather a seperate text box is populated then i dont think it will work</p>
