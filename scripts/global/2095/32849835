<p>There is a package that worked fine. I deleted it, and want to recreate the package. When I ran this part of the Derived Column, it shows as RED color. In the original package, it showeds BLACK i.e. no errors.</p>  <pre><code>(DT_BOOT)(ISNULL(Request)? 0 : (LOWER(Request)== "yes" ? 1 : 0)  The Derived Column Name = Derived Column The Derived Column = &lt;Add as new column&gt; The Expression = As shown above Data Type = Does not allow any input </code></pre>  <p>Is there something else missing?</p>
