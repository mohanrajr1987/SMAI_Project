<p>Hypothetical - A party store wants to select people based on criteria from their DB.</p>  <p>DB name "BirthDays" fields: Day, Month, Year</p>  <p>The "where" needs to be dynamic to take in each consideration for search instance:</p>  <ol> <li>Day = 12, Month = 1, Year = 1962</li> <li>Day = 3, Month = 4, Year = 1977 ; Day = 13, Month = 4, Year = 1977</li> <li>Day = 20, Month = 8, Year = 1941 ; Day = 9, Month = 1, Year = 1991 ; Day = 19, Month = 11, Year = 1986 ; Day = 25, Month = 2, Year = 1956</li> </ol>  <p>Below obviously will not work because it only considers one search instance when there may be 3 or even 10:</p>  <pre><code>query.Where(o =&gt; o.Day == 3 &amp;&amp; o.Month == 4 &amp;&amp; o.Year == 1997); </code></pre>  <p>I tried looking into Expression and ParameterExpression, but couldn't wrap my head around it.</p>  <p>[NOTE] @Luaan is the closest one so far, adding "||" will not address #1.</p>
