<p>I have a variable that looks like this:  AF1400006</p>  <p>I want to use regular expressions in order to return the number "14000". I have gone through many threads here, but none quite seems to get me anywhere. </p>  <p>Thanks!</p>  <p>EDIT: I don't see what's up with the downvotes, isn't this a forum for asking questions?  Anyhow, I solved my problem now, thanks for the help :-) For those wondering, I used it in a scanning software called Drivve Image to use parts of a barcode on a document as the name of the output folder. The software uses a unique regex formatting which seemed to be my issue. </p>
