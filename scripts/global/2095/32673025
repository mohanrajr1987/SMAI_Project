<p>can anyone help me to understand how are translated this 2 expression:</p>  <p>FIRST</p>  <pre><code>double val = 1/(b-1)/t*log(x1/x2); </code></pre>  <p>I have broke it with some c in many parts, but I have 2 different results:</p>  <pre><code>double val2 = ( 1/(b-1) ) / ( t*log(x1/x2) );   double b,t,x1,x2; b= 0.1; t= 0.2; x1 = 0.3; x2=0.4;  double val = 1/(b-1)/t*log(x1/x2); printf ("%1.4e",val);  double val2 = ( 1/(b-1) ) / ( t*log(x1/x2) ); printf ("%1.4e",val2);  if(val!=val2){   printf("different!"); }else printf("its ok"); return 0; </code></pre>  <p>SECOND QUESTION: Are there many differences of precision from double in c and java for very low order numbers?    </p>  <p>Thank you.</p>
