<p>I am using expression() to create a string that includes greek letters. My legend label is as follows:</p>  <pre><code>legend.label = paste(mu, "+", sigma, ", ", mu, ", ", mu, "+", sigma, " of random strategy", sep ="") </code></pre>  <p>This should give me something like: μ+σ, μ, μ+σ of random strategy, but instead I am getting this: <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/gBuWE.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/gBuWE.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>It seems as if there is an automatic space after the greek letters. I already tried using the * and ~ operator, but it didnt help. I am using the cairo package to create anti-anialised plots. However, without using the cairo package I seem to get the right result. Does anybody have an idea how to fix this? Thanks!</p>
