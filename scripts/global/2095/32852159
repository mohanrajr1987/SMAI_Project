<p>This should be super simple, I'm just new to MVC so I don't know where exactly to put it. I have a form that posts back all the data and caches the total number of orders. I am looking to also post back the total cost (which does not need to be cached). I am just wondering where/how I do this in my MVC solution. The cost is $30, so I THINK the syntax should look something like this: </p>  <pre><code>model.TotalCost = (30 * model.QuantityOrdered); </code></pre>  <p>I know this must go in the controller but my postback View is resulting in Total Cost = 0</p>
