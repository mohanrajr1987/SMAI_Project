<p>In my main table, I have a fairly complex query pulling 2 kinds of data and displaying them in one grid. Currently, if the user clicks on a value, they will be able to drill down into a breakdown of the data they clicked on. The problem is that I can only display data for one of the types of data. </p>  <p>I would like to display a breakdown of the other type but it would require displaying on a different report using similar parameters. I am looking for a way to pass parameters to sub-reports based on the contents of what I am clicking. For example (In the action expression) I have tried this:</p>  <pre><code>=IIf(Fields!Type.Value = "Job", "/Production Planning/SupportReports/Job_Plan_Board_Job_BD_v1 &amp; Parameters!ReqByDate.Value", "/Production Planning/SupportReports/Job_Plan_Board_Plan_BD_v1 &amp; , Parameters!ReqByDate2.Value") </code></pre>  <p>The parameter values are not passing. - I am pretty sure it is syntax as I have already tried everything I could think of with the parameter expressions...</p>
