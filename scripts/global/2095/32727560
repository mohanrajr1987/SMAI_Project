<p>Is it possible to return the second, third and fourth values in a multi-value parameter?  I can get the first one to populate just fine by using the parameter itself, but if I want to show the second one it doesn't work.</p>  <p>I've tried to use <code>=Choose(2,CChar(Join(Parameters!EventIDs.Value,",")))</code> or some variation of that, but to no avail.  Is there some other way to do this?  My parameter is ordered the way I want it so I just need to get the second value in the list.</p>
