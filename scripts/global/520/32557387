<p>Im looking for a framework and backend as a service that can provide me the infrastructure to build a Periscope-like application. </p>  <p>I found Kickflip.io and Cine.io (which is now dead) </p>  <p>So anyone knows any other alternative that offers this kind of services ? Doing it from scratch is too complex. </p>
