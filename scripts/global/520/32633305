<p>I'm taking a look at a Firebase library for .NET:</p>  <p><a href="https://github.com/ziyasal/FireSharp" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/ziyasal/FireSharp</a></p>  <p>I have a simple ASP.NET MVC site that I'm using to read/write data to Firebase. It's working great, but I'd like to incorporate the streaming listener functionality so I can get notified when data has changed.</p>  <p>What do I need to do in order to engage that? I don't believe it can just hang off an action method and be notified, correct?</p>  <pre><code>EventStreamResponse response = await _client.OnAsync("chat", (sender, args) =&gt; {        System.Console.WriteLine(args.Data); });  //Call dispose to stop listening for events response.Dispose(); </code></pre>
