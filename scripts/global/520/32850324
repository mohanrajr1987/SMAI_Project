<p>I'm trying to build a audio streaming app, like a radio. This is the URL of the stream: <code>http://radio.livesh.com.br:8068/</code></p>  <p>This is basically how I do:</p>  <pre><code>player = AVPlayer() let playerItem = AVPlayerItem( URL:NSURL(string:streamURL)! ) player = AVPlayer(playerItem:playerItem) player.rate = 1.0; player.play() </code></pre>  <p>The <code>player</code> var is stored so it does keep playing and is not being deinit'ed. In an iPhone 5S with iOS 8 it works and I can hear the sounds. In an iPhone 6 with iOS 9 it doesn't.</p>  <p>What am I doing wrong?</p>
