<ul> <li><strong>Real-Time Streaming Protocol</strong> (RTSP) - is a media playback control protocol. Other protocols that can be used in conjunction with RTSP include:  <ul> <li><strong>Real-time Transport Protocol</strong> (RTP) - Is a packet format used for delivering multimedia (e.g. audio and video streams) over an IP network. RTP is a sister protocol of RTCP.</li> <li><strong>RTP Control Protocol</strong> (RTCP) - is used to monitor transmission metrics and quality of service (QoS) while aiding in the synchronization of multiple streams. RTCP is a sister protocol of RTP.</li> <li><strong>Session Description Protocol</strong> (SDP) - is used by protocols like RTSP to describe media streams during the initialization phase of a handshake.</li> </ul></li> </ul>  <p>Just as I have boiled down the above protocols to 1 or 2 sentences, I was hoping someone could answer: in layman's terms, what is the difference between MPEG-DASH &amp; RTSP?</p>  <p>From a high level, MPEG-DASH appears to be an alternative to RTSP+RTP+RTCP+SDP.</p>
