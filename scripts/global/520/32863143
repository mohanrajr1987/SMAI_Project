<p>I have a use case as follows:- 1) There is a directory, which is updated with approximately 50 files in a span of one minute</p>  <p>2) All these files are gzipped CSV files around 20 MB in size</p>  <p>3) How should I collect them from the node and send them to Kafka topic in a near realtime manner, with minimal footprint on the source node?</p>  <p>Your inputs will be highly appreciated</p>
