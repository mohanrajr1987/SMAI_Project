<p>Hava is a device that can be connected to a Television source and streams audio and video to a remote client. It can support just one client at a time to prevent piracy. It works well but it is not supported any more by the producer.</p>  <p>To connect to the device you must install Hava player.  Latest version works for Windows 7. If you install it on Windows 8 or later you get a blue screen of death. Setting compatibility options on the installer does not work. If you unpack the installer and set compatibility for the files inside it does't work.</p>  <p>How to install it?</p>
