<p>I am currently trying to setup a musicbot on a ts3 server (I´m NOT the owner of the server). I did that with the following software:</p>  <pre><code>VB HiFi Audio Cable Equalify Pro Spotify </code></pre>  <p>To get the musicbot on the ts3 server i just connect with a second identity. The problem is that the soundbot generates a huge echo when in an channel with several people. I tried muting the other people as the musicbot but then the ppl are muted on my normal identity too (which is bad when i still want to communicate with them). I´m not the server owner, so creating groups and editing channels isnt an option!</p>  <p>Is there a way to mute ppl for only ONE identity? So that the musicbot isnt able to hear the other ppl in a channel but I´m still able to talk with everybody?</p>
