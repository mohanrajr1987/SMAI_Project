<p>What I want to do :<br> User hit a url (ex: BASE-URL/download/json).<br> Code fetch huge data from database and <strong>stream</strong> it into a JSON file and user is prompted to download that file.</p>  <p>What I tried :<br> Created a large (700 MB) JSON file. Tried opening it with code, but error was thrown. </p>  <blockquote>   <p>file_get_contents($file)</p> </blockquote>  <p>Error :</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Allowed memory size of XXX bytes exhausted (tried to allocate YYY   bytes)</p> </blockquote>  <p>I am working in Symfony2.  Data can be upto 700MB in size.  Can't increase the allocated memory. How can I achieve this?  Please comment if any further information is required.</p>
