<p>I'm attempting to simulate the use of pandas to access a constantly changing file.</p>  <p>I have one file reading a csv file, adding a line to it then sleeping for a random time to simulate bulk input.</p>  <pre><code>import pandas as pd from time import sleep import random  df2 = pd.DataFrame(data = [['test','trial']], index=None)  while True:     df = pd.read_csv('data.csv', header=None)     df.append(df2)     df.to_csv('data.csv', index=False)     sleep(random.uniform(0.025,0.3)) </code></pre>  <p>The second file is checking for change in data by outputting the shape of the dataframe:</p>  <pre><code>import pandas as pd  while True:     df = pd.read_csv('data.csv', header=None, names=['Name','DATE'])     print(df.shape) </code></pre>  <p>The problem with that is while I'm getting the correct shape of the DF, there are certain times where it's outputting <code>(0x2)</code>.</p>  <p>i.e.:</p>  <pre><code>... (10x2) (10x2) ... (10x2) (0x2) (11x2) (11x2) ... </code></pre>  <p>This does occur at <em>some</em> but not between <em>each</em> change in shape (the file adding to dataframe).</p>  <p>Knowing this happens when the first script is opening the file to add data, and the second script is unable to access it, hence (0x2), will this occur any data loss?</p>  <p>I cannot directly access the stream, only the output file. Or are there any other possible solutions?</p>
