<p>I'm trying to use my Digital Camera (Canon EOS 1100D) to serve as webcam for the Live Broadcast on YouTube. </p>  <p>The problem is that I can't choose the Digital Camera as Source when on Hangouts and/or Wirecast. </p>  <p>I have my camera connected via USB and when I fire the EOS Utility I can see the Live Shooting Mode. </p>  <p>But for some reason I can't choose it on Youtube Live as Source.  What I am missing? Should I connect it via HDMI cable instead?</p>
