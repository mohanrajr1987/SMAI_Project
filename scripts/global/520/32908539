<p>I am developing an Android application in which I want to publish as well as stream a video...</p>  <p>What I want is:</p>  <p>My app records a video and that video is sent to the server</p>  <p>The recorded video will be streamed live to another Android device at the same time..</p>  <p>P.S.:</p>  <p>I am using wowza server and RTMP stream. I would like to stream RTMP video (.flv)... If no solution is available, I would like to switch to RTSP and for that also, need a working link to follow.</p>  <p>Are there any suite of classes that make this easy?</p>
