<p>I have been working on a radio app in CodenameOne. I first did the podcast streaming which works fine and uses <code>MediaManager.createMedia(url, false);</code></p>  <p>The files from the podcasts are all mp3s. I tried using the same method to stream a .pls file and when that didn't work I tried streaming the <code>http://0.0.0.0:8080</code> (example <code>http://hostname:port</code>) url as well and it didn't work either. I am using Eclipse and not getting any crashes but no output either. </p>  <p>NOTE: I am able to get the stream on the Android API using the <code>MediaPlayer</code>'s <code>mp.setDataSource(url)</code> method.</p>
