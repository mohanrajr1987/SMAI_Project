<hr>  <p>I'm curious about whether I can save users bandwidth for mobile video streaming (the monthly cellular plan data can quickly dissapear with just a few videos streamed) - I've used gzip to send small files such as html, css, and javascript faster, and I'm wondering if it's a common practice (or even makes sense) to send individual packets in compressed form. Sort of gzip for a video stream. </p>  <p>Is this done? Why or why not? I use video streaming as an example, but I'm actually curious about streaming data for immediate usage (meaning decompression must happen constantly) in general. </p>  <p>I'm not sure that compression is effective on the packet level and I'm also not sure decompression during real-time playing would work out, that's really what I'd like explained.</p>
