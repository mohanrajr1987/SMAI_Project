<p>I am trying to make a streaming plot using plotly with the test code below (in jupyter) but it is not working.</p>  <p>The creation of the plotly streaming object works fine and creates a blank graph on the plotly server.  However, the creation of the stream link doesn't work.  The code executes and no error is returned but it does not place any data on the plotly graph.<br> If I just open the streaming link, s.open(), and check the connection status, s.connected, it returns False which suggests the connection is not working.  However, without an error message I am stuck.  Any suggestions appreciated</p>  <pre><code>import plotly.plotly as py from plotly.graph_objs import * import plotly.tools as tls Credentials = tls.get_credentials_file()['stream_ids'] StreamID = Credentials[1]  trace1 = Scatter(     x=[],     y=[],     stream=Stream(token=StreamID)     ) data = Data([trace1]) py.plot(data)  s = py.Stream(StreamID) s.open() s.write(dict(x=[1,2], y=[1,2])) s.close() </code></pre>
