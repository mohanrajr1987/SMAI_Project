<p>I have a web server APACHE with mp3 and wav files. Stream is ok for finalized file but not for live files.</p>  <p>My client is a simple HTML5 pages with this tag</p>  <pre><code>&lt;audio controls&gt;      &lt;source src = "http://myServer/live/live01.mp3"&gt; &lt;/audio&gt; </code></pre>  <p>The length of the file is determined, in a correct way, when loading my page. But when I get to the end of the duration previously recognized, the playing stops despite the underlying file has grown and so there is still a lot to listen to.</p>  <p>Where you need to act? In audio tags or settings apache so that in every response Streaming send me the current length of the file? And in this case how  on server and how on client to refresh information?</p>
