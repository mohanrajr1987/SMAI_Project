<p>I am making an app that will transmit data from glasses to the server for broadcasting. Til now i am able to download data from glasses to my iPhone document directory. now i want to upload that downloaded data to my server so that we can broadcast that data to our users.</p>  <p>My iPhone and glasses are connected with each other with the help of WiFi, and i am trying to upload downloaded data via cellular network.</p>  <p>So basically my concept is that download data from glasses and upload that to server.</p>  <p>I have try to make my iPhone as a server to that my back end team could download data from my iPhone.</p>  <p>I got success in this method but the problem is that for this process the client and server should be on same private ip networks.</p>  <p>so now we have left with only one way that we download TS chucks from glasses and same time upload the TS file to our server for broadcasting.</p>  <p>I am using <code>NFNetworking</code> to download video chucks from glasses "TS File" but not able to upload that chucks to my server. </p>  <pre><code>NSURLRequest *request = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://xxx.xx.xx.x/abc/trunk/WebServices/app/webroot/xyz"]];         AFHTTPRequestOperation *operation = [[AFHTTPRequestOperation alloc] initWithRequest:request] ;     operation.outputStream = [NSOutputStream outputStreamWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://abc.aa.a.a/xyz/trunk/WebServices/app/webroot/img/glasses/test/demo.ts"] append:NO];      [operation setCompletionBlockWithSuccess:^(AFHTTPRequestOperation *operation, id responseObject) {         //   NSLog(@"Successfully downloaded file to %@", path);         // NSLog(@"download finished!");         if(_delegate &amp;&amp; [_delegate respondsToSelector:@selector(ZBTM3U8SegmentDownloaderFinishDownload:)])         {             [_delegate ZBTM3U8SegmentDownloaderFinishDownload:self];         }      } failure:^(AFHTTPRequestOperation *operation, NSError *error) {         //  NSLog(@"Error: %@", error);     }];     [operation start]; </code></pre>  <p>It goes in success state but data is not uploaded on server  server folder show empty.</p>  <pre><code>- (void)postVideoOnServer {   NSDictionary *requestDict = @{ @"uniqueToken":@"101", @"user_id":@"102",};  NSArray *paths = NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSDocumentDirectory, NSUserDomainMask, YES); NSString *path = [[paths objectAtIndex:0] stringByAppendingPathComponent:_tsFileName];  NSData *selectedVideo = [NSData dataWithContentsOfFile:path];   AFHTTPRequestOperationManager *manager = [AFHTTPRequestOperationManager manager]; AFHTTPRequestOperation *operation = [manager POST:@"http://xxx.x.x.xx/myi/public_html/WebServices/broad/axy" parameters:requestDict constructingBodyWithBlock: ^(id &lt;AFMultipartFormData&gt; formData) {     [formData appendPartWithFileData:selectedVideo name:@"file" fileName:@"filename.ts" mimeType:@"video/quicktime"]; } success: ^(AFHTTPRequestOperation *operation, id responseObject)                                      {                                           NSInteger statusCode = operation.response.statusCode;                                          NSLog(@"Status Code ::%d", statusCode);                                          NSLog(@"Response ::%@", responseObject);                                          [self handleVideoServiceResponse:responseObject];                                      }                                         failure  : ^(AFHTTPRequestOperation *operation, NSError *error)                                      {                                          NSLog(@"Error: %@  %@", operation.responseString, error);                                       }]; [operation start]; } </code></pre>  <p>it always return request time out error.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
