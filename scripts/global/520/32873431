<p>I'm using <code>libcurl</code> in C++ to send requests to an HTTP service. I want to stream my <code>POST</code> requests. I'm observing things in Wireshark. When the request is tiny (i.e. fits in one frame) I see the request headers, a 100 response, the request body and then a 200 response. This is what I'd expect. When the request is too large to fit in one frame, <code>cURL</code> sends the entire request without waiting for a 100...it just fires away. Does anyone know why this happening or how to control this behavior?</p>
