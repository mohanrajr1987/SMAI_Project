<p>I am trying to obtain video from an IP camera Axis 6034E using OpenCV in c++. I can easily read stream using following simple code:<br/></p>  <pre><code>VideoCapture vid; vid.open("http://user:password@ipaddres/mjpg/video.mjpg"); Mat frame; while(true){   vid.read(frame);   imshow("frame", frame)   waitKey(10); } </code></pre>  <p>But my problem is, the password contain <code>@</code> and unfortunately it is the last charterer of the password. Any idea I will appreciate it.  I tried <code>\@</code> and some other encoding methods and it didn't help.</p>
