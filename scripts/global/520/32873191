<p>So i'm posting this to get some help. I'm going to make a website that has movies , like 10 or so "for sale" (this is for a school proyect so no legal issues or anything like that). I'd have to have users , those users purchase (don't know how yet, throught paypal i guess) a movie , then i need to check with php that certain user has certain movie , and let him stream said movie through  the website. So far i have the login with php , then i'd have to make the website which is easy , what i'm having difficulties with is checking for movies purchased, and how to embbed a player to play that movie ( assuming the movies are stored on the server).</p>  <p>So , any ideas as to how could i do that? I'm also going to have a back-end for admins to add movies , i could have the movie name in mysql then in the web just a script pointing to the name , that streams the file with that name hosted on the webserver.</p>
