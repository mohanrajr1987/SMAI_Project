<p>I've an application (UWP) that seems to have something broken during resuming event, but I can't understand what because the debugger is not called when I try to resume it.</p>  <p>I'm using mvvmlight and a custom frame, and I register handlers to resuming and suspending events in app.xaml.cs.</p>  <p>My app populate a list of items when it execute the splashscreen on the first time, this process is executed in background with an async method.</p>  <p>I'm using the SuspensionManager class as suggested in msdn <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh986968.aspx" rel="nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh986968.aspx</a> registering the frame immediately after it's created. I don't know why but when I put my app in suspend state (pressing "suspending" or "suspending and terminate" button in visual studio) and then when I resume it using the button in the same dropdown, I can't see the debugger executing my breakpoint that I set in Onlaunched and in App_Resuming of my App.xaml.cs.</p>  <p>On my device (I'm testing it on WP8.1) it only shows "app is resuming" and visual studio tell me that the operation is taking more time that expected. What can I do to understand what's going wrong? I can't see any exception or errors during the suspending event that seems to complete its tasks correctly</p>
