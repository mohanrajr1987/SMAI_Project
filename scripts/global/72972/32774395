<p>I'm using the new "Class Library (NuGet Package)" template in Visual Studio and I need my package to be available for all Windows 8+ and Windows Phone 8.1 apps. However, it blows up when I try to retarget it to those frameworks, and says that types like <code>object</code> or <code>string</code> are "not defined."</p>  <p>To repro:</p>  <ol> <li>Create a new "Class Library (Package)" project in Visual Studio.</li> <li>Double-click on <strong>project.json</strong> and change the target framework from <code>dotnet</code> to <code>netcore45</code> (<a href="http://oren.codes/2015/06/09/pcls-net-core-dnx-and-uwp/" rel="nofollow">table here</a> for more info).</li> <li><strong>BAM!</strong> 14 errors right out of the box. Even if you change <code>System.Runtime</code> to <code>4.0.0</code> (which is compatible with Windows 8) and get rid of the other dependencies, you still get errors about how <code>System.Void</code>, <code>System.String</code>, etc. etc. are not defined.</li> </ol>  <p>Does anyone know a solution to this problem? I can't just retarget it to Windows 10, because I need to use it in another library that targets those platforms.</p>  <p><strong>edit:</strong> When I target it to Windows 10 by changing it to <code>netcore50</code> it works perfectly, but I can't do that for said reasons.</p>
