<p><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/de-de/library/windows/apps/BR227276.aspx" rel="nofollow">StorageFolder.GetFilesAsync</a> is incredibly slow (~7 seconds for a folder with ~3500 files). Back in Windows Phone 8.0 Silverlight, I was able to get the content of the CameraRoll much faster (via the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.xna.framework.media.medialibrary.aspx" rel="nofollow">MediaLibrary</a>, &lt;1 second for the same amount of files).</p>  <p>Are there any possiblities to fasten GetFilesAsync up or is there any alternative for getting files of a folder?</p>  <p>I need the photo files to immediately extract information such as the Geotag or DateTaken. You can see how fast they loaded with Silverlight in my app <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9wzdncrfj0f2" rel="nofollow">GeoPhoto</a> which I am now trying to port to UAP. I've already implemented some kind of caching which maps the geotag and DateTaken to the picture path, so I would only need the picture path for subsequent app starts. Photos not yet cached could then be displayed later (after the long GetFilesAsync-call), but it is important to give the user something he can interact with immediately after he launched the app.</p>
