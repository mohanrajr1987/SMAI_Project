<p>I have a Windows Phone 8.1 RT application. In the app, I subscribe to <code>UnhandledException</code> event which is raised when any unhandled exception occurs in the application. I bind this event to an event handler, which is passed <code>UnhandledExceptionEventArgs</code> by the event.</p>  <p><code>UnhandledExceptionEventArgs</code> has a property <code>Exception</code>, which has a property <code>Stacktrace</code>. The problem is, I'm only able to access the stacktrace property <strong>only once</strong>, as it becomes null after I access it. </p>  <p>This weird behavior can also be observed when any breakpoint is hit and you try to access the value contained in the argument using the cursor or the immediate window. Once I hover the cursor or access the value in the immediate window, it becomes null afterwards.  </p>  <p>It also causes an issue when I read any property of <code>UnhandledExceptionEventArgs</code> before reading the <code>Stacktrace</code> property. Say, if <code>e</code> is of type <code>UnhandledExceptionEventArgs</code> containing <code>Message</code> and <code>Exception</code> object, accessing <code>e.Message</code> before accessing <code>e.Exception.Stacktrace</code> makes the value contained in <code>e.Exception.Stacktrace</code> null.  </p>  <p>Any idea why this odd behavior is observed?</p>
