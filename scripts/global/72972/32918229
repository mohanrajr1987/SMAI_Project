<p>I am trying to load a remote image in XAML which requires an authentication header to successfully download. </p>  <p>Currently I'm using my own caching service where I download the image using HttpClient and store the file to disk. On subsequent loads, I just bind the image to the absolute file path of the cached file like so:</p>  <pre><code>              &lt;Image Width="50"                    Height="50"                    Stretch="UniformToFill"                    HorizontalAlignment="Center"                    VerticalAlignment="Center"                    Source="{Binding CachedImagePath}"/&gt; </code></pre>  <p>This works however I'm not too pleased with the time it takes to load the image from the file. It seems much slower than if I use XAML caching.</p>  <p>So my questions are:</p>  <p>1) Is there a way to pass an authentication header when I bind my Image to a remote URI?</p>  <p>2) If not, can you recommend a quicker way to load the image from disk than how I currently have it?</p>
