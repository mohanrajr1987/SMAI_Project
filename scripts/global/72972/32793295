<p>I am trying to learn to use MySQL in new Windows Universal App. I want to easily display a table with the values from a MySQL data base in my Computer. I am able to get the Data and make the connection successfully but not sure how to build the table in XAML and C#. I tried with a textblock and was only able to get one string not the full Table. Not sure if I should use a DataGrid like some examples but the method DataSet is unavailable in the new Universal Apps so I am not able to follow those examples.</p>
