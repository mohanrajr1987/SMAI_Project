<p>I have 3 grids in my application which contains data and I have applied </p>  <pre><code>header.Arrange(new Rect(0, 0, header.ActualWidth, header.ActualHeight)); </code></pre>  <p>to each grid and did whatever I want to do with that, but that messes the layout of whole page. And I want to fix these grid to their own places again. Is that possible to do that? I have tried <code>InvalidateArrange();</code> but that didn't help.</p>
