<p>I am trying to make a torch application in windows tablet. The ultimate aim is that <strong>"User should have immediate access to the torch"</strong>. I managed to put the application in the settings tab of <strong>charms bar</strong>. But it requires 2 clicks, first on the setings bar then torch application.</p>  <ul> <li><p>Is it possible to put the application in the charms bar itself?, so the user can launch the application with a single click.</p></li> <li><p>Or is there any way to get a trigger from external keys?. Something like, "long press on the volume key will launch the application", or "long press on camera button etc..".</p></li> </ul>  <p>Any Help will be highly appreciated :).</p>
