<p>I am working on an windows8 application, in which I have a grid to show list of items. Each row has a textbox to take some input, when I enter any value on one of the textbox in a row and then scroll down then other rows (scrolling up from bottom) automatically has this same value set in the textbox. This is causing issues as I am getting unwanted rows in behind code. </p>  <p>Any idea what is this and how to handle it ?</p>  <p>Below is how it looks - See, I am on 3rd line and 6th line already has value.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/gvWXb.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/gvWXb.png" alt="enter image description here"></a> </p>
