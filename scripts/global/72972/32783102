<p>My WPF Desktop app is using WinRT classes as well.</p>  <p>In order to do that I follow this tutorial  <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/using-winrt-apis-from-desktop-applications" rel="nofollow">https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/using-winrt-apis-from-desktop-applications</a>.</p>  <p>Fine, it works.</p>  <p>Now when I try to generate the msi file (I tried both with using Microsoft Installer and ClickOnce), I am getting this error:</p>  <p><em>Problem generating manifest. Could not load file or assembly 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.1\References\CommonConfiguration\Neutral\Windows.winmd' or one of its dependencies. Attempt to load a program with an incorrect format.</em></p>  <p>I already tried with disabling the ClickOnce as suggested  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28986517/windows-8-compatible-camera-implementation/29225637#29225637">here</a>, with cleaning the project and with deleting ASP.NET temporary of the different NET framework.</p>  <p>This is my startup tag in my app.config                    </p>  <p>I am using VS2015 and C# How can I fix it and generate my msi?</p>  <p>PS: I have no problem in generating another msi with a simple WPF desktop app.</p>
