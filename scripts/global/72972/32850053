<p>I'm creating an About page for a Windows Runtime app targeting Windows Phone 8.1. On Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 UWP, it's all but trivial to display most of the basic information about an app by using an API called <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.applicationmodel.package.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>Windows.ApplicationModel.Package</code></a>.</p>  <p>But, for reasons beyond my comprehension, <code>Windows.ApplicationModel.Package</code> is severely handicapped on Windows Phone. While things like <code>Id</code>, <code>InstallDate</code> and <code>InstalledLocation</code> have been available since Windows Phone 8, <code>DisplayName</code>, <code>Description</code> and <code>PublisherDisplayName</code>, the things users actually care about, are not. (The version information is present in <code>Id</code>, which is something at least.)</p>  <p>Are there any other ways to access this information reliably on Windows Phone, save from reading and parsing the manifest XML myself, or worse, hardcoding the values? I'd really rather not have to resort to either of those.</p>
