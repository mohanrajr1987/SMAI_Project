<p>Hello i want to create a scheme URI to launch my app from another app. I searched a lot, i found this tutorial <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/jj206987%28v=vs.105%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">URI associations</a>, it shows how to register your app for A URI association but it is for Windows Phone 8. I am developing an app for Windows Phone <strong>8.1 RT</strong> and none of the tutorials i found work. At least I'd like to know if it is supported on WP 8.1 RT.</p>
