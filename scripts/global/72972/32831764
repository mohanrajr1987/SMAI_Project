<p>I'm making an app for Windows 8.1 where it is important to be able to zoom in and examine images in detail.  If I just open up the bitmap and zoom in it looks like.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/1ff0X.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/1ff0X.png" alt="Can see the pixels"></a></p>  <p>However when I load the image into my app and use the ScrollViewer to zoom in I get.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/JDKMY.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/JDKMY.png" alt="Pixels are fuzzy"></a></p>  <p>As it appears to be trying to interpolate pixel values for some sort of anti-aliasing.</p>  <p>How can I get it so that when I zoom in it shows (as best it can) the exact pixels of the image?  In particular I'm using the image as the background to a canvas which is contained in a scroll viewer.</p>  <hr>  <p>I've looked around on here and MSDN and found a pair of related questions, but as yet they don't seem to have solved my exact problem.</p>  <ul> <li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/592017/my-images-are-blurry-why-isnt-wpfs-snapstodevicepixels-working">A discussion on WPF</a></li> <li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18926130/winrt-how-do-i-ensure-images-are-drawn-in-a-pixel-perfect-way-on-a-canvas">A similar issue with a canvas</a></li> <li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21869295/disable-interpolation-of-child-elements-in-windows-rt">Older related question on pixel art</a></li> </ul>
