<p>In a thread I catch ThreadCanceledException, but not others, in hope to see errors, if any. However, when a thread starts and the code has an error, it produces messages</p>  <pre><code>A first chance exception of type 'System.Exception' occurred in ... The thread ... has exited with code 259 (0x103) </code></pre>  <p>and gracefully quits without showing the actual exception. The error can be identified only if I run the code in UI thread.</p>  <p>Is there a way to get the actual exception to be reported within a thread?</p>
