<p>Bugsense is telling me that i am getting a lot of exceptions like with this, in my WinRT Phone application</p>  <p>title:</p>  <p>A Task's exception(s) were not observed either by Waiting on the Task or accessing its Exception property. As a result, the unobserved exception was rethrown by the finalizer thread.</p>  <p>and this stackstrace:</p>  <pre><code>    0 System.AggregateException: A Task's exception(s) were not observed either by Waiting on the Task or accessing its Exception property. As a result, the unobserved exception was rethrown by the finalizer thread. ---&gt; System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.              1 at ABC.Core.IncrementalLoadingCollection`1.&lt;&gt;c__DisplayClass20_0.&lt;&lt;LoadMoreItemsAsync&gt;b__0&gt;d.MoveNext()     2 --- End of inner exception stack trace ---     3---&gt; (Inner Exception #0) System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.     4 at ABC.Core.IncrementalLoadingCollection`1.&lt;&gt;c__DisplayClass20_0.&lt;&lt;LoadMoreItemsAsync&gt;b__0&gt;d.MoveNext()&lt;---     5     6--- Inner exception of type System.NullReferenceException start ---     7--- Message: Object reference not set to an instance of an object. ---     8System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.     9 at ABC.Core.IncrementalLoadingCollection`1.&lt;&gt;c__DisplayClass20_0.&lt;&lt;LoadMoreItemsAsync&gt;b__0&gt;d.MoveNext()     10--- End of inner exception stack trace --- </code></pre>  <p>Has anyone ever had this before? Should I move IncrementalLoadingCollection into the main app and not have the class in a seperate dll?</p>
