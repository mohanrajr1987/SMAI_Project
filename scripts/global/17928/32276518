<p>I am generating an excel sheet using apache poi <code>HSSFWorkbook</code>. One of the excel column is showing error message about "Number stored as text". This column is not a numeric column,and want to keep that column as character column. </p>  <p>So while adding value to cell , I add a zero width Unicode character also as follows  <code>cell.setCellValue(cellData + "\\U+200B");</code> </p>  <p>The issue is, cell value just print "U+200B" in excel sheet, instead of using the Unicode zero width space. </p>  <p>I would like to know, is there any way I can add a zero width space to poi cell value in java.</p>  <p>I want to keep the column as character column, but want to get rid of the message"Number stored as text" in excel.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance, Mathew </p>
