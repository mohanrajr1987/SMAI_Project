<p>I have this problem that I can't seem to figure out. After researching I can't seem to find anyone that has solved it. I'm not sure that it can be solved in pure CSS, but I have to ask:</p>  <p>Consider a situation where there are two divs next to each other. The divs have a known width.</p>  <p>The size of the content, however, is not known. When the content of one div becomes very large, that div should take space from the other, as such:</p>  <p>This width should only grow if the known width can't accommodate the content.  Likewise, the blue div should grow if its content is very large:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZCF8D.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZCF8D.png" alt="Width examples"></a></p>  <p>Is this possible to solve with only CSS, or would I need JS?</p>
