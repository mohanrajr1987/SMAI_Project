<p>I'm trying to replicate the NSTextFields and their width changing depending on content seen in Apples Contact App.</p>  <p>I've seen the textfield.sizeToFit() method, but this doesn't seem to work with auto layout and draws the textfield over the top of the next textfield along.</p>  <p>I don't suppose anyone has any ideas as to how you might achieve this. I feel like I'm missing a quick trick to make this easy...</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/0rffy.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/0rffy.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
