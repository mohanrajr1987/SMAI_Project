<p>Is there any way to get the current size of a TableView column? I've haven't even been able to find the question online which makes me think I've missed something since I can't be the first one to need this functionality.</p>  <p>If that isn't possible, is there any way to set the size of a TableView column? That would also solve my issue although I'd prefer getting the size. <code>setFixedCellSize(double)</code> looked promising, but I couldn't get it to work.</p>  <p>I want to have a TextField above each column in my TableView with the same size as the column it's above. If there's a better way to accomplish that, I'm open to suggestions.</p>
