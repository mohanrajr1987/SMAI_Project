<p>This code (<a href="http://jsfiddle.net/rena92oo/" rel="nofollow">jsfiddle</a>):</p>  <pre><code>&lt;table style="border:1px solid black;width:auto;"&gt; &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td style="width:100%;"&gt;hello.&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td style="width:100%;"&gt;World&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt; </code></pre>  <p>produces a table expanded to the width of the window, with the first <code>td</code> expanding to fill. The second <code>td</code> remains at its minimum size.</p>  <p>According to the CSS <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visudet.html#propdef-width" rel="nofollow">specification</a>, a percentage on the <code>width</code> property refers to the width of the containing block.</p>  <p>In this situation I'd intuitively expect the excess width to be shared by the two cells. However, I haven't found anything in the Tables section of the specification that describes the definitive behavior in such a case.</p>  <p><strong>Question:</strong> What is the definitive behavior here according to CSS specifications? </p>  <p><strong>Note:</strong> I'm not looking for "fixed" versions of this code. I just want to understand the behavior of this code as it is based on the official CSS specification.</p>
