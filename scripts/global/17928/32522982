<p>Im having an issue with my navbar in bootstrap, I've changed the collapse width to make it look better since i have alot of links. The width I changed to is 1400px but as you can see on the picture below the navbar does not create the scrollable navbar unit you hit 767px in width (as standard)...</p>  <p>I cannot find where I should change to make it work again.</p>  <p>Is there anyone here that had this problem before or that can help me to fix this?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>  <p>Image to see the problem: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/LRCZ431.png" rel="nofollow">image</a></p>
