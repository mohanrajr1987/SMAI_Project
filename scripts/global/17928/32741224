<p>I know it has already been asked <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9967111/increase-tumblr-photo-size">HERE</a> but the solution doesn't work for me.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Enlarging from 500px makes it blurrier. Tumblr does actually store a   copy of your image wider than 500px. It's called HighRes, and it's (up   to) 1280px.</p>      <p>In your theme HTML, Replace photoURL-500 with photo-HighRes, for   example, and resize from that.</p> </blockquote>  <p>As you can see from my tumblr page (<a href="http://reviewsbytea.tumblr.com/" rel="nofollow">http://reviewsbytea.tumblr.com/</a>) the image url has "500" in it and it stretches and looks ugly even though <a href="http://puu.sh/klk5f/4336ad3022.png" rel="nofollow">in the code</a> it's clearly written:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/vj2bp.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/vj2bp.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <pre><code>&lt;img src="{PhotoURL-HighRes}"/&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I tried {PhotoURL-100}, I tried {PhotoURL-1280}. Nothing changes! The generated URL still has 500 in it.</p>  <p>Help please?</p>
