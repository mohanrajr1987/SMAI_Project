<p>People, I'm at a loss.</p>  <p>Here's how my last 2 days look like: I've been trying to find a solution to the "super headers" problem in a datagrid. In other words: making merged-across-columns headers above the datagridcolumn headers. there are several solutions in SO and uncle google, but some are over-complicated and some require XAML, which I don't want to use.</p>  <p>Given a <code>DataGrid</code> named "myDataGrid" and an horizontal <code>StackPanel</code> named "spSuperHeaders" filled with <code>TextBlock</code>s, I've put the latter on top of the first in a vertical <code>StackPanel</code>. Now, I am trying to do the following, and I fail in every step, independently.</p>  <ol> <li>Set the minimum columns width in myDataGrid to the largest among a custom number ("minimumRequirewdWidth"), the required width of the column content (which is fixed, so no binding is required, just setting) and the required width of the <code>DataGridColumn Header</code> (which is sometimes larger tan the `DataGridColumn' width and sometimes smaller).</li> <li>Get the actual/resulting/de-facto widths of the <code>DataGridColumn</code>s and setting the width of the `TextBlock's to these widths.</li> <li>Setting some of the `TextBlock's width to the sum of several of myDataGrid's columns.</li> </ol>  <p>The connection between myDataGrid's columns widths and the `TextBlock's width can be done either is simple setting or by binding, since there's no change in the width during runtime.</p>  <p>Thanks, guys.</p>  <ul> <li>Using c# with visual studio 2013.</li> <li>Only with code, please, no XAML. All the process is dynamic in code.</li> <li>can't post sample code since it's on a different, disconnected network. Sorry</li> </ul>
