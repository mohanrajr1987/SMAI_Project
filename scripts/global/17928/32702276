<p>My GridView :  </p>  <pre><code>&lt;asp:GridView ID="GridView1" runat="server"     OnRowDataBound="GridView1_RowDataBound"     AutoGenerateColumns="true"     DataKeyNames="Role_id"&gt; &lt;/asp:GridView&gt; </code></pre>  <p>In code behind :  </p>  <pre><code>protected void GridView1_RowDataBound(object sender, GridViewRowEventArgs e) {     if (e.Row.RowType == DataControlRowType.Header)     {        //e.Row.Cells[2].Width = 120;                      // isn't working....     }     if (e.Row.RowType == DataControlRowType.DataRow)     {         e.Row.Cells[2].Width = new Unit(120);             // isn't working....         TableCell cell = e.Row.Cells[2];         cell.HorizontalAlign = HorizontalAlign.Right;           //**** does work!         cell.BackColor = Color.LightGray;                       //**** does work!         //cell.Width = 120;                               // isn't working....         //e.Row.Cells[2].Width = new Unit("120px") ;      // isn't working....         //e.Row.Cells[2].CssClass = "myGV_Cell_Width";    // isn't working....     } } </code></pre>  <p>The GridView is populated successfully.<br> Notice that I <strong>can</strong> set the alignment and the backcolor of the column, but not its width.<br> I tried many solutions circulating around but none worked.<br> It always resizes the column to the longest content.<br> Can it be done at all...?</p>
