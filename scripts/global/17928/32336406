<p>I'm attempting to make a html5 object within an iframe set to 100% width to no avail. At the moment the width of the inner html5 object overflows the iframes boundaries and doesn't fit correctly so I'm trying to constrain it. I've used code like so:</p>  <pre><code>#quote iframe object {     width: 100% !important; } </code></pre>  <p>This doesn't seem to work. Is there any way of targeting an inner html5 element easily? </p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
