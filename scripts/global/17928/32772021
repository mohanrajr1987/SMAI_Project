<p>I have a classs for a widget area and I have tried every CSS centering technique I know.....and more.   </p>  <p>I've had the most success with:</p>  <pre><code>.widget {     max-width: 500px;     margin-left: 50%;     margin-right: auto; } </code></pre>  <p>However it doesn't work on a variety of screen widths.</p>  <p>Any pointer would be appreciated as I'd love to brush up on my CSS centering.</p>
