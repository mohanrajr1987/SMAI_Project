<p>I just updated to Windows 10 and had to reinstall Genymotion. I use it to play clash of clans and with the previous version, I could launch the training of an archer and a barbarian at the same time by right clicking in the middle of the two icons. Now I can't do this anymore because the width of the two pixels touched by right clicking has increased. </p>  <p>Is there a way to configure this?</p>
