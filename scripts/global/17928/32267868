<p>I have been looking for hours now and I hope someone can help me here.</p>  <p>I am creating a form in vba where I want to dynamically add Listboxes. The listboxes are added, so that goes as planned. However, I can't seem to change the width and heigth of the listbox. All other things are being changed. This is my code:</p>  <pre><code>Dim lb As MSForms.ListBox Set lb = Me.controls.add("Forms.Listbox.1") With lb     .ColumnCount = 4     .Left = 180     .Top = 16     .MultiSelect = 1     .Height = 270     .Width = 665 End with </code></pre>  <p>The other thing that I noticed is that Heigth and Width aren't in the property list of the ListBox. Could it be that I use the wrong ListBox type?</p>  <p>EDIT: It get's stranger. When I go through the code line by line, it functions normally and the ListBox size is as I want it.</p>
