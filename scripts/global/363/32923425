<p>I want to upload a form to a php server with ajax and then send this form to another server with curl. in the first server I send posted form with curl like this :</p>  <pre><code>$user_agent='Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:8.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/8.0'; $ch = curl_init() curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL,$url); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, 1); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS,         $_POST);  ... </code></pre>  <p>which $_POST is all fileds of posted form. all fileds is sending(with curl) to second server correctly, but file input of form is missing.</p>  <p>what should I do?!</p>
