<p>I am trying to make a program that needs to read JSON data from a give file. But the JSON files may be very complex. Here is the code i am using</p>  <pre><code>static void Main(string[] args) {     //step one: get a correct file path     string filepath = getFilePath("Please write here the path to your file");     //getFilePath is just a function I wrote to read user entry and automatically sanitize the string.     while (!File.Exists(filepath)) { filepath = getFilePath("The file path appears to be wrong, please correct."); }     //Setep 2: read the text of the file     string fileJSONString = File.ReadAllText(filepath);     //step 3: parse      object myDictionaryFromJSON = (new JavaScriptSerializer().DeserializeObject(fileJSONString));     object question1 = myDictionaryFromJSON.questions[0]; } </code></pre>  <p>The thing is that Visual Studio gives me a lot of erros. I have tried using <code>Dictionary</code> instead of <code>object</code>, but it still doesnt work the way I need it to work. For example, this would actually work on python.</p>  <pre><code>myDictionaryFromJSON = json.loads(JSONtext); question1 = myDictionaryFromJSON['questions'][0]; question1text = question1["theQuestion"]; question1options = question1["options"]; question1correctAnswer = question1["correctAnswer"]; </code></pre>  <p>This is just an example. The thing is that Python and javascript can work with json perfectly, and are really good at converting JSON strings to dictionaries and objects. But C# is not working. I don't know what  to do. What could I do?</p>
