<p>I have a UIView(called <strong>innerView</strong>) inside a UIView(<strong>outerView</strong>). The outerView has Autolayout constraints and is always centered in the root view. The innerView is just placed in the outerView arbitrarily without any constraints. And they are all linked to the view controller by outlets.</p>  <p>I want the innerView to be always centered inside the outerView. Of course, i can use autolayout, but i just have to test if i can move it by code(because i found it is a problem in my real project) </p>  <p>unfortunately, i find i can't move the innerView with code. Anyone knows the reason?</p>  <p>here is the code:</p>  <pre><code>import UIKit  class ViewController: UIViewController {      // outerView is 300 X 300     @IBOutlet weak var outerView: UIView!      // innerView is 140 X 140, and it is the subview of outerView     @IBOutlet weak var innerView: UIView!      override func viewWillLayoutSubviews() {         super.viewWillLayoutSubviews()          innerView.center = CGPoint(x: outerView.bounds.midX, y: outerView.bounds.midY)         innerView.autoresizingMask = .None         // result is : (150.0, 150.0) which is correct         print(innerView.center)     }      override func viewDidAppear(animated: Bool) {         super.viewDidAppear(animated)          // result is : (78.0, 222.0) which is not correct         print(innerView.center)     } } </code></pre>
