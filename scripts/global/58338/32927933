<p>I'm using the aubio audio library in my iOS app. Its been compiling fine in Xcode 6.3. Since updating to Xcode 7 i've been trying to debug this error that occurs on device on app startup. </p>  <p>I'm using aubio version 0.4.2, iOS universal framework. </p>  <blockquote>   <p>dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/lib/libaubio.4.dylib     Referenced from: /var/mobile/Applications/3263665E-C6B5-4B86-9AAF-C6A783A5ED80/MyApp.app/MyApp     Reason: image not found</p> </blockquote>  <p>If I set aubio as an optional framework it loads the rest of the app but then crashes on the first call to aubio, in my case <code>new_aubio_pitch()</code></p>  <p>I thought it might be to do with Bitcode, so turned it off and still get the error.</p>  <p>I've also tried adding the framework to "Embedded Binaries"</p>  <p>The project contains Swift files, in case that could be affecting it. </p>
