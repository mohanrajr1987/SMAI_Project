<p>I added the following to customize my back button in my navigation bar but the image just overlaps/duplicated:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/eyzJC.png" rel="nofollow">http://i.stack.imgur.com/eyzJC.png</a></p>  <pre><code>- (void)viewWillAppear:(BOOL)animated{ //take out the label following the button UIBarButtonItem *backButton = [[UIBarButtonItem alloc]initWithTitle:@"" style:UIBarButtonItemStylePlain target:nil action:nil];  //set image for back button [[UINavigationBar appearance] setBackIndicatorImage:[UIImage  imageNamed:@"backButtonImage.png"]]; [[UINavigationBar appearance] setBackIndicatorTransitionMaskImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"backButtonImage.png"]];  self.navigationItem.backBarButtonItem = backButton; } </code></pre>  <p>It's supposed to be an image of one black arrow facing to the left.</p>  <p>Before it worked fine but now it does this when I simulate it. Any insight and help would be appreciated.</p>  <p>Thank you</p>
