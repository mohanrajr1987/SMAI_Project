<p>Currently, I have a string provided by reverse geocoding. It's accurate, however it's not as accurate as I would like. </p>  <p>The following is my code, at least the main bit.</p>  <pre><code>            if placemarks.count &gt; 0 {                 let date = NSDate()                 let formatter = NSDateFormatter()                 formatter.dateStyle = .MediumStyle                 formatter.stringFromDate(date)                 let pm = placemarks[0] as! CLPlacemark                   var testifempty = "\(pm.subLocality)"                 if testifempty == "nil"                 {                     self.locationManager.startUpdatingLocation()                     if let lbutton = self.lbutton{                         lbutton.text = "What's Up " + "\(pm.locality)" //+ "\n" + formatter.stringFromDate(date)                       }                  }                 else                 {                     self.locationManager.startUpdatingLocation()                     if let lbutton = self.lbutton {                         lbutton.text = "What's Up " + "\(pm.subLocality)\n" // +  </code></pre>  <p>I'm curious if it's possible to have an if statement or a range, as in if coordinates = so and so then replace the string with what I have currently. </p>  <p>So for example, if I'm home and it returns the Name of my town, but I'd rather it return the name of say, a specific part of the neighborhood, I would put in said coordinates of the part of the neighborhood and thereby the string of the general town name would be replaced by the specific one.</p>
