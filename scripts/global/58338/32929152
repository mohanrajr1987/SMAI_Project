<p>I have a case where each user has a list of tags (1 to 200), I want to be able to search for users based on tags. What's the best way to setup the relationship in Parse?</p>  <p><strong>Tag is a custom class</strong></p>  <ol> <li>Array on User object that holds tags</li> <li>PFRelation on User object that holds tags</li> <li>Have a separate entity names UserTags that has two fields one for User one for Tag</li> <li>Have a PFRelation on each tag to hold users?</li> </ol>  <p>performance wise which one is the best choice and why?</p>
