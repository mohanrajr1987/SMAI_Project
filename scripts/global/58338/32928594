<p>So here's my problem. I am currently trying to create a rectangular enclosure using four more rectangles as borders. So it would look somewhat like this. Keep in mind each side is individual so a rectangle with a border wouldn't work.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ftqcr.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ftqcr.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Now the actual problem comes with different screen sizes. Specifically the 4s. Since the screen is <em>shorter</em> than other phones, how would I resize the rectangles on the side to fit the height? One of my options was detect the screen size, and then set the height of the rectangle, but I was wondering if there was an easier way since I'd also have to deal with all the other screens. </p>
