<p>I'm a first time programmer learning the Swift language while trying to create my first app. I'm not exactly well-versed in syntax so this may be redundant but I have given it thorough investigation on here as well as many other sites and I suppose I just don't have the insight to realize exactly what mistake I am making. If anyone has any intimation as to why this is happening that would be greatly appreciated.</p>  <pre><code>{ {     photoImageView.image = info[UIImagePickerControllerOriginalImage]) as? UIImage     self.dismissViewControllerAnimated(false, completion: nil) } } </code></pre>
