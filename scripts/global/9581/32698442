<p>So i am developing a small app for hotels. I am using java and mysql. I use mysql to save booking information and guest data and so on. But now i want to make my program to be more flexible.  For example if i want to add more apartments(store apartment names) or change the payment methods. At this time i store the data as binary in files and read them from there when i start the program or when i need them. Is this method correct? or is a better way? Should i use the mysql and read the data from there?</p>
