<p>I need my website to save basic text to a .txt file located in the server. Using PHP is not a option because the site is hosted on Google Drive which does not support PHP.</p>  <p>So for testing purposes I want to create a button and when you press it, it will write <strong>"something 123"</strong> to a .txt file located in the server.</p>  <p>Using jQuery I managed to LOAD text from a .txt file so surely saving is possible as well?</p>  <p>This is what I used to load text from a .txt file and it worked perfectly</p>  <pre><code>&lt;script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.3/jquery.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script&gt; $(document).ready(function(){     $("#LOAD_TEXT_HERE").load("test.txt"); //This is the .txt file located in the server }); &lt;/script&gt; </code></pre>  <p>How can I write text to this same file using jQuery? (or using other methods?)</p>
