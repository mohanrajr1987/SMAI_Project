<p>I have just installed Web Forms For Marketers 8.0 and do a test form. Trying to select <code>Save to Database</code> from the list of action but it is not there. Also, I have checked <code>/sitecore/system/Modules/Web Forms for Marketers/Settings/Actions/Save Actions</code> but it is not there as well.</p>  <p>Why did they remove saving to database? How do I return it back again (as that is a requirement on my existing project?</p>
