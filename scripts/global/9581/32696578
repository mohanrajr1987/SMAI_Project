<p>I have an old catalogue which I am editing so it's up-to-date. The old catalogue is on 66 pages and comes up to 140mb.</p>  <p>I have so far made 5 pages for the new version of the catalogue and I'm already up to 67mb. At the moment I use the "High Quality Print" option when I save the catalogue as a PDF, but it still seems like an awful big size for only 5 pages, considering the other catalogue is 66 pages and only 140mb(without any significant loss in quality it seems like).</p>  <p>I chose the High Quality Print option since I will print the catalogue later on, but what are the optimal saving options to keep the file size down while getting good enough quality to print it?</p>
