<p>i am new to web based programming and i am working on a program that takes a live stream and outputs it.The program i used for streaming is vlc and my browser can run either vlc player and default player "videos" of ubuntu.</p>  <p>Here is my code</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?php  function flush_buffers(){     ob_end_flush();     ob_flush();     flush();     ob_start(); }   header('Content-Type: video/mpeg');   $stream = fopen( 'http://localhost:8080/stream.mp2v', "rb" ); $save = fopen("saveee.mp4", "w"); while ( ! feof( $stream ) ) {      $response = fread( $stream, 8192 );      echo $response;     fwrite($save,$response);     flush_buffers(); }  fclose( $stream ); fclose($save); exit(); </code></pre>  <p>Here in my code i can <strong>save</strong> the record starting with beginning of stream with "fwrite" function.But,I want to add a button to my streaming file and control the save mechanism with this button.But i dont know how to add button to "vlc player" or "videos" that shows me the stream when i start the stream file.How can i control my fwrite function with the button.</p>  <p>Thanks for your help.</p>
