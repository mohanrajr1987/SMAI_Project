<p>I have solved a differential problem using Matlab, but I'd like to plot the solution using Plotmtv. How should I save the informations of both the solution and the mesh in order to create a file that Plotmtv could accept?</p>  <p>Plotmtv is a software for plotting. I'm using it with the solutions obtained from FreeFem, for istance. Generally it needs a text file with the information of the mesh used and of the solution. FreeFem uses mesh with triangular elements while my Matlab mesh is composed by squares, so I'm not sure if it is possible to import Matlab information in Plotmtv.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
