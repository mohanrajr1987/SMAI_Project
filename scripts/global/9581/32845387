<p>Here is my code. I can't save more than 1 thing in the list, I don't know why.</p>  <p>The point of the program is to save words (like "banana") and then add a description to it ("yellow"). I'm using Python 2.7</p>  <pre><code>word = []   desc = []  def main_list():      print "\nMenu for list \n"     print "1: Insert"     print "2: Lookup"     print "3: Exit program"      choice = input()     print "Choose alternative: ", choice      if choice == 1:         insert()     elif choice == 2:         look()     elif choice == 3:         return     else:         print "Error: not a valid choice"  def insert():     word.append(raw_input("Word to insert: "))     desc.append(raw_input ("Description of word: "))     main_list()  def look():     up = raw_input("Word to lookup: ")     i = 0     while up != word[i]:         i+1     print "Description of word: ", desc[i]     main_list() </code></pre>
