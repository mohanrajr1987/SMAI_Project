<p>I create PDF figures with python+matplotlib and I can add a javascript alert box that shows the data from the figure when the PDF is opened.</p>  <p>I want to change the behavior in such a way that there is a button in the PDF. You might have seen "print" buttons in some forms. Pressing this button would ask the user the filename and save a hardcoded string to that file. Also another button could save the PDF as PNG (that can be hardcoded also).</p>  <p>The problem I have are privileges. The PDF-javascript-api says that silent file access is forbidden, but if a user initiates the save then it is allowed (e.g. with a standard save dialog).</p>  <p>However I cannot get the save dialog method to work. Adobe's <code>doc.saveAs()</code> without the arguments does not open save dialog, but complains about insufficient privileges. </p>  <p>I want the solution to be as portable as possible. Everything should be embedded into the PDF (one file).</p>  <p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>  <p>Just found a similar but completely different approach: you can put attachments into PDFs that are like buttons and can be saved to disk: </p>  <p><a href="http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/117792/listings-copy-to-clipboard-feature">http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/117792/listings-copy-to-clipboard-feature</a></p>  <p>This is the current code that I have:</p>  <pre><code>var nRslt = app.alert({cMsg: "save data?", nType: 3}); app.alert({cMsg: nRslt}); if (nRslt==4){ this.saveAs(); } </code></pre>  <p>The button is in a form and if the result is 'OK' (nType = 4) the save dialog should be opened. This produces </p>  <pre><code>NotAllowedError: Security settings prevent access to this property or method. Doc.saveAs:4:Doc undefined:Open </code></pre>  <p>The goal is to move the button to the document from the alert box and modify the content what is saved. But now the security settings are giving me a hard time. </p>
