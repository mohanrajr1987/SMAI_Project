<p>I am using Entity Framework (code first) to generate 2 'types' of databases. The 1st database has all the static data and is not likely to change much. The 2nd database uses the 1st database to generate unique dynamic data.</p>  <p>There will be multiple versions of each database, each type 1 database will have many type 2 database based off of their data. </p>  <p>All of this data is currently being saved automagicly to a <code>mssqllocaldb</code> with just 1 database of each type.</p>  <p>I need to know how to save these databases to specific files (named by the user) and select which files to load at runtime.</p>
