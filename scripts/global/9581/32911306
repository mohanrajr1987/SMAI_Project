<p>I'm working on a gradebook program assignment for a class; the details aren't so important, except to know that I need to be able to save a file and recall it later. I know how to serialize, deserialize, etc, and everything's good there. But the problem comes when I try to save. I'm a bit new to the whole saving data scene, and I don't exactly know the techniques, but what I have seems like it should work - except that every time I try it, I get an error.</p>  <pre><code>private static void Save (IList&lt;GradebookEntry&gt; gradebook) {         Console.WriteLine ("Saving changes. Please wait...");         using (IsolatedStorageFile stored = IsolatedStorageFile.GetStore (IsolatedStorageScope.User | IsolatedStorageScope.Assembly, null, null)) {             try {                 using (IsolatedStorageFileStream isoStream = new IsolatedStorageFileStream ("Temp.utc", FileMode.Create, stored)) {                     BinaryFormatter bform = new BinaryFormatter ();                     bform.Serialize (isoStream, gradebook);                     string[] s = stored.GetDirectoryNames ();                     stored.DeleteFile ("Gradebook.utc");                     stored.MoveFile ("Temp.utc", "Gradebook.utc"); // #!!                 }                 Console.WriteLine ("Changes saved.");             }             catch (Exception ex) {                 Console.WriteLine ("Saving failed. Reason: {0}", ex.Message);             }             finally {                 if (stored.FileExists("Temp.utc")) {                     stored.DeleteFile ("Temp.utc");                 }             }         }     } </code></pre>  <p>The marked line, where I try to move the file, is where I have problems. Everything else works fine, but when I reach that line, it throws an IsolatedStorageException with the message "Operation not permitted". I've looked all over, I've studied MSDN, I've searched all the places I can, but I can't figure out what the problem is. It's probably just something I overlooked, but I'm tearing my hair out here and I could use a bit of help. Thanks.</p>
