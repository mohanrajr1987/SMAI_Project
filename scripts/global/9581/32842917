<p>I am making a new game that will have about 4 worlds with 7-8 levels each, so about 30 levels in total. I am trying to figure out a way to save data such as highScores, unlockStatus, best time etc for each of them. </p>  <p>The best way I have found so far is to make 1 GameData class with the NSCoding format for each world that than saves the level data. It works fine but it still seems very clunky and a lot of code as I have 4 GameData classes now and in each I still need create properties like highScores etc for each level. Lets not even talk about iCloud key value storage. </p>  <p>How would a game like the new Angry Birds 2 save and keep track of its game data for 240 plus levels? Surely they do not create 240 properties for highScores etc. </p>  <p>Could someone please steer me in the right direction.  Thank you for any help and suggestions</p>
