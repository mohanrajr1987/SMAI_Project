<p>I have a very strange problem with DST. If I put my team in the Brasilia time zone and turn on "Time Setting summer time automatically" and if I try to create a new date in the browser on the day that daylight saving time begins with the time "00:00:00 "date that automatically creates me subtracts an hour. For instance:</p>  <p><strong>Daylight saving time starts on October 18.</strong></p>  <pre><code>new Date ("2015-10-18T00:00:00")  // the date is created: 2015-10-17 23:00:00 - this is wrong  new Date ("2015-10-18T01:00:00") // the date is created: 2015-10-18 01:00:00 - this is fine </code></pre>  <p>Any clues?</p>
