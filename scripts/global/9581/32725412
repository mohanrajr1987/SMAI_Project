<p>i cant figure out this one so maby you guys can help me out.</p>  <p>i store some data in the form of a array filled with Objects in this example cards.</p>  <p>in my main class i have the following code:</p>  <pre><code>deckSprite.savedData = SharedObject.getLocal("cardsdata"); deckSprite.savedData.data.savedArray = deckSprite.deckArr; deckSprite.savedData.flush(); trace(deckSprite.savedData.data.savedArray); </code></pre>  <p>the trace will output something like [object card1, object card2, object card3]</p>  <p>now in a static class called "deckSprite" i have this:</p>  <pre><code>savedData = sharedObject.getLocal("cardsdata"); if (savedData.data.savedArray == undefined) { trace("no save yet"); } { else { trace("save loaded"); deckArr = savedData.data.savedArray; trace(savedData.data.savedArray); </code></pre>  <p>now my trace data turns out only ", ," (somehow the cards are gone).</p>  <p>now after i got saved data i restart my application and whenever he tryes to acces the deckArr it crashes giving me the error "A term is undefined and has no properties".</p>  <p>how is it possible that when i save the array it saves all the cards inside the array and when i restart the application its suddenly only ",,"but the cards are gone?</p>
