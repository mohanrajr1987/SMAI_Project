<p>I don't know if i'm doing something wrong or what, but i have a problem. Situation : I am writing a code, testing it and it works not as expected ( has a small problem), then i save all files and starting to search for the problem. After few modifications i was trying to build it but code had a bunch of mistakes so i decided to just close VS and restart my project from the place i saved it. But after i open the project it opens at the very same spot after my last build ( with a bunch of mistakes in the code) . Why is that? Am i doing something wrong?</p>  <p>P.S. After i close my VS window asking "Do you want to save?" never shows up.</p>
