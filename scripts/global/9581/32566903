<p>In an attempt to add features to an online platform for file sharing, I would like to offer a seamless Integration of the platform content itself with other applications. This Integration should allow registered users to <strong>open and edit an uploaded file on the server</strong>. In the end the user should be able to open a link, e.g. <code>API.php?File=/Overview.odt</code>, in an editing software of their choice and be prompted the required document.</p>  <p>However, when the user saves the document, it will be saved as a temporary document on their computer (disk). Is there any way to directly access the file not only to open it, but also for saving?</p>  <p>I already looked at the FileWriter specification but wasn't really happy about the browser support...</p>  <p>Thank you for your answers.</p>
