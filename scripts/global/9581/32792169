<p>I'm writing this code, trying to save some data in Parse from the PickerView but it gives me an error. The idea is that the user complete the username label and choose from a pickerview one option of a job (and then go to the next screen...), but when I'm trying to save the 2 data from the user in Parse, it doesn't work.</p>  <hr>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/cgnCE.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/cgnCE.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <hr>  <p>Please, let me know how I can fix this. Thanks!</p>
