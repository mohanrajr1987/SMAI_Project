<p>Today I have setup the apache2 on linux mint with php website. First of all, I find that I always need to use root rights to write files to the folder. Then When I go to the php website and then do uploading pictures from website, Data saved but not pictures which will save in the linux mint folder "USER_IMAGE". Then I try to chanage the folder rights. chmod 777 USER_IMAGE. But still cannot uploaded.</p>
