<p>I am writing an App, in which I would like to append a text file, as various user actions happen.  I would like the text file to be located in internal memory.  I would like the text file to also be visible under Windows Explorer, if the user connects the tablet with a usb cable.</p>  <p>I have looked at many examples, and have been able to write a text file to internal memory, but I can not seem to make the file visible in File Manager.</p>  <p>Does anyone know if it is possible to write a text file to internal memory, and have it visible to the user under Windows Explorer?  Or do I need to use an SD card instead of internal memory?</p>
