<p>I am trying to make a backup copy of an image, because it will be resized often. I am asking for the path where the image is (Tkinter), then I am adding to the path and the image an "-original" and save it in the same directory where I got it from.</p>  <p>The problem is everytime I use this function it overrides the original, because there is no loop which makes the programm check wheter there already exists a file with "-original".</p>  <p>Thats how I make the backup save:</p>  <pre><code>        pfad = askopenfilename()         im_backup = Image.open(pfad)         start_string = pfad[:pfad.index(".")]         ende_string = pfad[pfad.index("."):]         im_backup.save(start_string + "-original" + ende_string) </code></pre>  <p>Currently I am working on a solution with os which could work, but I have the feeling it has to be simple. I red the documentation of PIL.Image.save, there are more arguments which can be passed in to save, but I dont figured out which one has to be used to prevent overriding.</p>  <p>My current solution (not working yet) is checking with os.listdir(directory) wether there is already a (start_string + "-original" + ende_string) file and only save it there if it is false.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
