<p>I am a creating a program for taking input of criminal cases that have contents like Name, Crime, Date of Crime, etc... I want to create a program where, after taking input from user (i.e., details of the crime) it gets stored and when the user chooses to view cases, the new case that is filed, is also added to it. And this will be looped, i.e., if the user wants to input case again, he/she may do so, and the new case taken, will be added to already existing cases, including the case filed earlier. </p>  <p>I need an idea! I need an idea as to how can this be done! What shall I use? Will arrays help? </p>
