<p>I want to be able to save multiple specific worksheets to a PDF.</p>  <p>I currently have this code which works:</p>  <pre><code>Sheets(Array("Print - Cover", "Print 2.2")).Select ActiveSheet.ExportAsFixedFormat Type:=xlTypePDF,  Filename:=PDFFile,Quality:=xlQualityStandard, IncludeDocProperties:=True, IgnorePrintAreas _ :=False, OpenAfterPublish:=OpenPDFAfterCreating </code></pre>  <p>This saves sheets "Print - Cover" and "Print 2.2" to a PDF as intended. Instead of hardcoding the sheetnames, I would like to save whichever worksheets have a name that exists within a range of cells.</p>  <p>E.g. in cells <code>A1:A3</code> of my ActiveSheet, I could have <em>Bee, Cat and Dog</em>, and the macro would</p>  <ul> <li>select worksheets <em>"Bee", "Cat" and "Dog"</em>, </li> <li>but not <em>"Pig"</em>, which exists as a worksheet but isn't listed. </li> </ul>  <p>The number of sheets listed may increase or decrease.</p>  <p>The purpose of this is to allow users to easily indicate which sheets they would like saved without having to edit the macro.</p>
