<p>I am using a custom chatadapter that I use to make a simple chat program with multiple user. However as soon as I leave the chat activity all the messages are gone. What would I have to do to save all the messages of that chat history and then put them back in the chat window when the user opens up the chat? The chats are in a listview. I am new to JAVA so I am not fully aware on how to go about this. If I understand correctly I would have to use SQL. Can anyone guide me as to the efficient way to do this? Thanks</p>
