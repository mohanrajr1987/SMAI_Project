<p>I have created an app using the "tabbed application" template.</p>  <p>I renamed the top view controllers for both initial tabs (initially "First" and "Second"), and embedded each in a navigation controller.</p>  <p>Next, I dragged a UITableView into one of the view controller's main view, resized it to fit perfectly, and set constraints for:</p>  <ol> <li>"Leading space to container margin"</li> <li>"Trailing space to container margin"</li> <li>"Vertical spacing to top layout guide"</li> <li>"Vertical spacing to bottom layout guide"</li> </ol>  <p>Next, I wrote code in the view controller to handle the table view (set delegate, data source, adopt protocols, register cell class, etc.)</p>  <p>Also, I implemented a "detail" view controller (xib based, not present in the storyboard) which instance I push into the navigation when a table row is selected.</p>  <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> For the view controller that has a table view only (second image below), both the navigation bar and tab bar appear in a darker, medium gray (instead of the default "almost white"):</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/JHQLw.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/JHQLw.png" alt="Unchanged, original view controller"></a></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/9SUY3.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/9SUY3.png" alt="View controller with table view manually added"></a></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/L8qSX.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/L8qSX.png" alt="View controller instantiated from separate xib"></a></p>  <p>I have tried changing the navigation bar's <code>translucent</code> property, and setting the view controller view's <code>backgroundColor</code> to white, but nothing changes.</p>  <p>I know this has to do with the (overly complex un twisted) way view controllers behave since iOS 7, but I can't quite find the solution anywhere...</p>
