<p>I have created a tab bar view controller with 3 bar item, in storyboard.</p>  <p>Now on tap of a tab bar item I want to present a ViewController which is connected to tab bar item via Navigation controller.</p>  <p>How this can be achieved programmatically since I have not created any tab bar object.</p>  <p>(OR) Is there a way to capture the tab bar item selection (which is created in storyboard)</p>  <p>Thank You...</p>
