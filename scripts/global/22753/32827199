<p>I have an app with a root UITabBarController that contains a few UISplitViewControllers. Everything works as expected, except when the split view is collapsed I would like to be able to hide the tab bar. I'm pushing the new detail view controller with <code>[self.splitViewController showDetailViewController:detailNav sender:self];</code> and all attempts to call <code>hidesBottomBarWhenPushed</code> have failed. Everything is laid out in code, I don't use storyboards.</p>  <p>Is this even possible, or am I stuck with the tab bar if I use a split view controller on an iPhone?</p>
