<p>Ok so here is the thing, i have an app with a tabbarcontroller. I have four tabs on this tabbarcontroller (test1, test3, test4, test5). If i am already on the first tab, when i select it, i want this tab to change from test1 to test2. Currently i managed to change the title, but for actually reload the view i have to switch to one of the other tabs and come back. I'm struggling on this issue for quite a while now and i can't seem to find where i failed.</p>  <p>Here is the code of the controller link with my four tabs: <a href="http://pastebin.com/tvJ0PYvR" rel="nofollow">http://pastebin.com/tvJ0PYvR</a></p>  <p>and here is the code link to my tabbarcontroller : <a href="http://pastebin.com/jSw8dPfJ" rel="nofollow">http://pastebin.com/jSw8dPfJ</a></p>  <p>Any help would be appreciated, thanks.</p>
