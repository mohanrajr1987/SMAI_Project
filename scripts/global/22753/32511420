<p>I have a window with a UITabBarController as rootViewController. The UITabBarController has two children: A UINavigationController and a UISplitViewController (according to the latest docs this should be OK, and it works except for the following problem).</p>  <p>Both the UINavigationController as well as the UISplitViewController show a MyMasterTableViewController which can push instances of MyDetailViewController. MyDetailViewController has self.hidesBottomBarWhenPushed = YES to make the TabBar disappear on push.</p>  <p>When I push MyDetailViewController onto the UINavigationController the UITabBar disappears as expected. When I show MyDetailViewController on the UISplitViewController while it is collapsed, I would expect the same, since the collapsed UISplitViewController contains only a UINavigationController with the Master which pushes the Detail ViewController. It doesn't however.</p>  <p>How can I let a collapsed UISplitViewController make the UITabBar hide on showing MyDetailViewController like the UINavigationController does?</p>
