<p>I am experiencing an issue with UITabBarController when using iPad split view. When the iPad is in landscape and the app is in the 70/30 split view with another app there are 8 tab items shown. 7 tab bar items I provided and the automatically generated more tab. </p>  <p>If I select say the 6th item and change the split view to the 50/50 view, the tab bar automatically reduced the number of visible tabs down to 5 tab items. The tab I previously selected(6th tab) changes into the more tab and the selected tabs view updates to the correct size. The issue ensues when I then change back to the 70/30 split view. The correct tab is selected(6th tab), but the view goes blank. I checked the view hierarchy and it is no where to be found. </p>  <p>One weird thing is if I select the more tab the contents of the 6th tab is shown. Again, selecting the 6th tab shows the blank screen.</p>  <p>Has anyone ran across this or have any suggestion to try? I am programmatically creating the tab bar if that makes a difference.</p>
