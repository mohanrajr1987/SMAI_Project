<p>I'm using a storyboard as my launch screen in my app, it contains a UITabBarController with 5 UINavigationControllers. The storyboard doesn't do anything but provide launch screens.</p>  <p>What I want to do is change the default selected tab. I'm currently stuck with this:<a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/icFw9.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/icFw9.jpg" alt="launch tab bar"></a></p>  <p>And once the actual view controllers load I get this:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/sMhu9.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/sMhu9.jpg" alt="actual tab bar"></a></p>  <p>As you can imagine it's a bit jarring to have the selection jump like it does. I don't know how to change the tab programmatically since I cannot attach a custom class to anything in a launch screen. Of course, I don't really care if I do it for real, if there's a way to fake it with icons of different colors, that's fine as well, but the system adds that tint to selected icon.</p>  <p>Is there a way to do this with a storyboard launch screen? Thanks.</p>
