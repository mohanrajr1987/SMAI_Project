<p>I have a couple of questions about implementing a custom tab bar for an iPhone app using Objective-C.</p>  <p>1) I am trying to create a "raised" center button on the tab bar. Basically, I am placing a UIButton over the center tab and switching to that tab whenever the button is pressed. I created an image (with @2x and @3x assets) to use for the button. This works fine on the iPhone 5S and iPhone 6, but on the 6 Plus, this image doesn't cover the full width of the tab bar item, meaning I can still see the item underneath it a bit. Shouldn't the @3x asset be big enough to cover it on the 6 Plus?</p>  <p>Here is an image on the 6:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/rorr4.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/rorr4.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>And on the 6 Plus: </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/cdpDl.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/cdpDl.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>As you can see, the selected color appears behind the image, meaning the image is not fulling covering that tab bar item. Why?</p>  <p>2) Is there a way to set the tint color of a tab bar item different for each item? Meaning I want the first tab to be tinted blue when selected, the next one to be red, etc. I cannot figure this out.</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
