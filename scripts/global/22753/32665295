<p>I looked at the following two resources:  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27698195/tab-bar-disappears-after-segue">Tab bar disappears after segue</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15915930/my-tab-bar-controller-disappears-after-a-push-segue">My Tab bar controller disappears after a push segue</a>. However, both of them are in Objective-C and they don't seem to address the issue that I am having. </p>  <p>Here is my Main Story Board:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/3LHtb.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/3LHtb.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Zoomed in is: </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/QtB04.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/QtB04.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Now, let's  call the view controller that has Sign Up and Log In VC1 and the one with the Facebook button, VC2. When I go to VC1 from the Tab Bar Controller, everything is good. I have the tab bar on the bottom of my VC1. And I tap <code>Sign Up</code> and the tab bar is gone. Which I want. And when I go back to VC1 (there is a navigation bar on VC2 with the button <code>cancel</code> that I programmatically added in, and when clicked on, takes me to VC1), the tab bar is gone. But I want the tab bar there. </p>  <p>Some people have suggested me to use a <code>navigation controller</code>. But I do not want to use it because I don't want the tab bar to appear when the user clicks on <code>Sign Up</code>. And, the navigation controller only allows for right to left and left to right segues and I want custom segues (I tried customizing the segues for a navigation controller and it caused a crash for me). </p>  <p>So my question is, does anybody know how to keep the tab bar on VC1 AFTER going to another View Controller WITHOUT a tab bar, and going back to VC1 WITH the tab bar?</p>  <p>Sorry for the long post.</p>
