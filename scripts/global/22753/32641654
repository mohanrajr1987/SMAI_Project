<p>I am currently having a problem. I was attempting to clean up my storyboard which became far too large.  I have been attempting to do this by modifying the UITabBar controller I previously set up using the interface.  Now I'm attempting to alter the buttons on the tabbar so that when clicked they each go to separate storyboards where those views are now located; essentially recreating the individual tab items.</p>  <p>The problem is, though, that now the separated ones do not display their navigation item which was present before and I was wondering if anyone knows how to do this?  I've found many resources but so far no success, currently I have the navigation item visible in the interface by setting the top bar section to a translucent navigation bar which displays the navigation item in the interface but does nothing to display it on build.</p>  <pre><code>    let eventStoryBoard = UIStoryboard(name:"ScheduleStoryboard", bundle: nil)      var eventListViewController = self.storyboard!.instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier("EventListViewController") as! UIViewController      let icon1 = UITabBarItem(title: "Schedule", image: UIImage(named: "app_ico_schedule"), selectedImage: UIImage(named: "app_ico_schedule"))      eventListViewController.tabBarItem = icon1      var createAlbumController = self.storyboard!.instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier("PhotoAlbumListViewController") as! UIViewController      let icon2 = UITabBarItem(title: "Albums", image: UIImage(named: "app_ico_photos"), selectedImage: UIImage(named: "app_ico_photos"))      createAlbumController.tabBarItem = icon2      var views = self.viewControllers      views?.removeAtIndex(1)      views?.insert(createAlbumController, atIndex: 1)      views?.removeAtIndex(0)      views?.insert(eventListViewController, atIndex: 0)      self.viewControllers = nil     self.setViewControllers(views!, animated: false) </code></pre>  <p>Currently I'm doing this modifying the values of the individual items and setting them to views on separate storyboards.</p>
