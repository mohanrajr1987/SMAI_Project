<p>I'm using YALFoldingTabBar for a project <a href="https://github.com/Yalantis/FoldingTabBar.iOS" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/Yalantis/FoldingTabBar.iOS</a></p>  <p>I want to change its behavior a bit, by showing the current ViewController as the centerButtonImage, instead of a plus/cross sign. </p>  <p>I've tried to override <code>didSelectItem</code> like this: </p>  <pre><code>   override func tabBar(tabBar: UITabBar, didSelectItem item: UITabBarItem!) {      switch(self.selectedIndex)     {     case 0:         self.centerButtonImage = UIImage(named: "whatever")     default:         //Change image     }      switch (self.selectedViewController)     {     case 0 as GameViewController:         //Change image     default:         //Change image     } } </code></pre>  <p>The code below is in my <code>CustomTabBar</code>, subclassing <code>YALFoldingTabBarController</code>.  </p>  <p>But it doesn't seem to work that way. I've also tried to manipulate the tabBar in the specific <code>UIViewControllers</code>'s <code>viewDidLoad</code> or <code>viewDidAppear</code> but it seems like the tabBar is set only. </p>  <p>Is this possible, and if so, what am I doing wrong?</p>  <p>EDIT: It seems like the method is not called, when changing viewController.</p>
