<p>I am trying to set a different image as <code>selectedImage</code>, I found this script to put in AppDelegate:</p>  <pre><code>var tabBarController = self.window!.rootViewController as UITabBarController let tabItems = tabBarController.tabBar.items as [UITabBarItem]  tabItems[2].selectedImage = UIImage(named: "image.png") </code></pre>  <p>But it does not work.</p>  <p>Am I missing something obvious or made a mistake?</p>
