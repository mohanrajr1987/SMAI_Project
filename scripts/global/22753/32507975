<p>If you place a split view controller inside a tab bar controller the navigation bar and tab bar are darker on the left side.  I've attached a screenshot.  I created this by creating a Master-Detail Application and then adding a tab bar controller.  How do you correct this issue?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/b3xvL.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/b3xvL.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
