<p>I am creating a view with tab bars and I want some space below the tab bar to show some other content, at the bottom of the screen.</p>  <p><strong>Using Tab bar controller:</strong> When I use tab bar controller, the tab bar cannot be moved to place another object below it. </p>  <p><strong>Using Tab bar and tab bar items:</strong> When I use just tab bar and tab bar items, I am unable to connect the items to another view controller or rather anything. Also it doesn’t seem very efficient when my app has multiple tabs.</p>  <p>What is the best and efficient way to achieve some space at the bottom of the screen with tab bar controller?</p>  <p>Below is an image showing “some space” at the bottom of the screen below the tab bar.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/rGd89.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/rGd89.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Thanks</p>
