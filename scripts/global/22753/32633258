<p>I have a tab bar application. After the app is launched, login view controller is presented modally and dismissed when successful login occurred.</p>  <p>The problem is with logging out. I created a separate view controller for that which is related to tab bar. Now, inside this logout controller when the button is pushed the login view controller is presented modally again. </p>  <p>However, I keep getting the following warning:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>ReminderApp[34546:5473971] Warning: Attempt to present ReminderApp.LoginViewController: 0x7fc7c1cc4340> on ReminderApp.LogoutViewController: 0x7fc7c1d477b0> whose view is not in the window hierarchy!</p> </blockquote>  <p>I tried the following to solve it:</p>  <p>a) Segue to tab bar controller instead of login view controller which eventually will present the login view controller - again the error with view hierarchy occurred.</p>  <p>b) Tried dismissing login view controller which resulted in error because the controller was not presented modally, it has a relationship to the tab bar controller.</p>  <p>I'm not sure if any code would be helpful here so I show only the method that segues and the screenshot of my storyboard:</p>  <p>LogoutViewController:</p>  <pre><code>    @IBAction func logout(sender: UIButton) {       self.deleteData()     let appDomain = NSBundle.mainBundle().bundleIdentifier     NSUserDefaults.standardUserDefaults().removePersistentDomainForName(appDomain!)      self.performSegueWithIdentifier("logout", sender: self)  } </code></pre>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/QH9sX.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/QH9sX.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>My question is: How to do it properly to get rid of that tedious warning about view controller's hierarchy?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
