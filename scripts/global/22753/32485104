<p>On an iPhone 6 Plus when a user selects the second-to-last view in the More tab, then rotates the device to landscape and back to portrait, the visible view controller will change to another.</p>  <p>I've been experiencing this issue since the 6 Plus came out.  It's reproducible with iOS Xcode 6/iOS 8 and Xcode 7/iOS 9 Beta 5</p>  <p>I built a sample application with the TabBar fully configured in IB. <a href="https://github.com/kselman/iPhone6PlusTabBar/tree/master" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/kselman/iPhone6PlusTabBar/tree/master</a></p>  <p><strong>Edit:</strong> How do I prevent the UITabBar from interrupting and changing the view after rotating?</p>
