<p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/tIVhV.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/tIVhV.png" alt="TabBar Design"></a></p>  <p>Can I have a UITabBar within another TabBar as shown in the image, inside my app? The first TabBar has 2 items(selected in blue), and the Second TabBar can have 3 items (One Way, RoundTrip, Multiple). If I cannot have a TabBar inside a TabBar approach, what other method can I use?</p>
