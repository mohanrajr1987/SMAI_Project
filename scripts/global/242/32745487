<p>I'm trying to create XML files that follow a XSD schema. </p>  <p>The information that would go into that XML file would come from a Word file. </p>  <p>How would I go about doing this programatically? Or is there already any tool that can do this? </p>  <p>I've been searching using Google but i can't find a good choice.</p>  <p>The final XML would be uploaded to a database that has that specific schema.</p>  <p>What do i need?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
