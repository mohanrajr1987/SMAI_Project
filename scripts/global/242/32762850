<p>Following is my query...</p>  <p>Am not able to find the filesystem mapping for "/login" mentioned in form action. Tried looking within the DocumentRoot location (in httpd.conf as well as for virtual hosts), but none present. Also looked for any alias specification or a symbloic link, but no luck there either.</p>  <p>Any ideas please what else to look for ? The application page is working as expected; am trying to understand the logic behind it.</p>  <p>The background to this is .... one of the internal application (deployed on a Solaris server using Zend) is developed in PhP, and the contractor has since left whithout any documentation in place; typical scenario !</p>  <p>Have been looking at this application as there is a requirement to migrate it to a new infrastructre, and being not really conversant with PhP/HTML am trying to find my way through !</p>  <p>Any help is much appreciated ... thx.</p>
