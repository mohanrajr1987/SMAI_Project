<p>I'm having this problem when the response from an endpoint is a JSON array.</p>  <p>Restkit automatically detects it's an Array and maps the ObjectMapping to an Array of ObjettMappings, but this occurs JUST THE FIRST time after the installation of the app. After the first request, and mapping, the array mapped by restkit arrives with the correct order.</p>  <p>I'v tried using <code>@metadata.mapping.collectionIndex</code> aproach, but it also comes with an inverted order, so it isn't useful. I can't map to an NSOrderedSet because Restkit automatically detects it's an array and maps the <code>RKMappingResponse</code> to an array.</p>
