<p>I have an Excel sheet that maps medication (in Rows) to side effects (in Columns). </p>  <ol> <li>Row 1 is the header.</li> <li>Medicines are listed in Rows A2 through A62.</li> <li>Side effects are in Columns B1 through BZ1</li> <li>Against each medicine (in Rows), the possible side effects are indicated by a 1 or 2 entered in the Column for that side effect. 1 indicates a strong side effect and 2 a weak one.</li> </ol>  <p>This mapping was started for my child with special needs and has grown since. I want to be able to list all side-effects for a specific medicine or list all medicines for any side-effect, on a different worksheet.</p>  <ul> <li>If I pick a medicine from a drop down list and indicate the strength of the side effect the macro must list all side-effects with the picked strength in a single Row as a contiguous list.</li> <li>Similarly, if I pick a side effect and indicate the degree by choosing 1 or 2, the macro must list all medicines that cause that side effect of the chosen strength in a single Column as a contiguous list.</li> </ul>  <p>I also want this VBA to be generic so that I can adapt for similar mapping of diet vs behaviour, therapy vs learning and so on.</p>
