<p>I have a file which maps IP address to hostnames. Its format is similar to hosts file and contains a list of IP address to hostname mapping.</p>  <p>eg.</p>  <pre><code>10.200.99.1    master1 10.200.99.2    master2 10.200.99.3    master3 10.200.99.4    slave1 10.200.99.5    slave2 10.200.99.6    slave3 ... ... ... </code></pre>  <p>I would like to create network file (<code>/etc/sysconfig/network</code>) for all the IP address mentioned in the file.</p>  <p>The format of network file is where the hostname is mentioned based on hosts file.</p>  <pre><code>NETWORKING=yes HOSTNAME=master1 NOZEROCONF=yes </code></pre>  <p>For every IP Address the network file is created in a directory named by IP Address i.e. <code>network/{IPAddress}</code>.</p>  <p>For example for <code>master1</code> the path of file should be <code>network/10.200.99.1</code> and for <code>master2</code> the path should be <code>network/10.200.99.2</code>.</p>  <p>How can i do so?</p>  <p>Till now I have obtained IPAdress by following command <code>echo $(&lt;hosts) | awk '{print $1}'</code> and Hostname by <code>echo $(&lt;hosts) | awk '{print $2}</code>. But this only prints the contents of first line of the hosts file.</p>
