<p>Good Afternoon,</p>  <p>I am currently attempting to research/devise a process for the conversion/mapping of word document tables to a SQL server with the following conditions:</p>  <ol> <li>The proces must not used the Word to Excel conversion, this is currently being used and has been found to be insufficient.</li> <li>The conversion must keep the formatting associated with the Word Table as well as allow for the storage of images if they are present.</li> <li>Minimal coding may be required however this is intended to be a fast project</li> </ol>  <p>Based upon my research so far nearly every source is stating that the word to Excel component will be required.</p>  <p>If anyone can advise on a potential procedure to achieve my goals or inform me if the Word to Excel requirement cannot be avoided this would be of great assistance.</p>  <p>Regards</p>  <p>JByrne</p>
