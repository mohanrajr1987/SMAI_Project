<p><strong>Hi team,</strong></p>  <p>I need to be able to connect to a Ubuntu 12.04 server in my home office when I am away from my office from time to time. I am having difficulty setting things up to achieve this end point.</p>  <p>This is what I can do:</p>  <p>I can login to Server (960) over the LAN and run my web application fine from several devices in the office.</p>  <p>I can login as 'root' into server as necessary.</p>  <p>I can ping the server (960) successfully from another device on the LAN.</p>  <p><strong>Port forwarding on the router</strong> is set up correctly so:</p>  <pre><code>Mapping External    External  Internal   Internal   Name    Interface   Protocol   Start Port   End Port    Port     Host RDP     TNZ_FIBRE   TCP         3389        3389        3389     192.168.1.76  VTIGER  TNZ_FIBRE   TCP         8888        8888        8888     192.168.1.76  VTon960 TNZ_FIBRE   TCP         8080        8080        80       192.168.1.64  </code></pre>  <p>I can login with RDP into a Windows desktop (Startpoint 3389, Endpoint 3389, Internal port 3389, LAN IP address of target desktop).</p>  <p>I can achieve HTTP access to a Windows webserver (Startpoint 8888, Endpoint 8888, Internal port 8888, LAN IP address of target Windows webserver).</p>  <p>canyouseeme.org shows 3389 and 8888 as open to be used.</p>  <p>On the Linux server (960) I ran <code>wget http://localhost:80</code> and got the following confirmation that port 80 is listening:</p>  <pre><code>http://localhost:80/ Resolving localhost (localhost)... 127.0.0.1 Connecting to localhost (localhost)|127.0.0.1|:80... connected. HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK Length: 177 [text/html] Saving to: ‘index.html’ </code></pre>  <p>What settings do I need for the Startpoint, Endpoint and Port for VTon960?</p>  <p>What do I have to do on 960 to get it to listen/hear requests coming in?</p>  <p>My ISP has blocked port 80 obviously.</p>  <p>All assistance is much appreciated.</p>  <p>Bernard</p>
