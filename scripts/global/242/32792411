<p>I got a word like this: <code>kfc</code></p>  <p>Then a dictionary: <code>{'k':'1', 'c':'3'}</code></p>  <p>How can I get a list like that?</p>  <p><code>kfc, 1fc, kf3, 1f3</code></p>  <p>It means there always will be <code>2^n</code> possibilities, with <code>n</code> is the number of dictionary's keys in that word.</p>  <p>P/s: All I can think is using recursive function, however, I prefer non-recursive.</p>
