<p>I have a function f(x,y), where x and y are pixel coordinates (like in OpenCV <code>cv::Point(i,j)</code>), that maps a float value to every pixel pair (x,y). My question is: What is the correct data structure to represent this mapping? I want to have something like an array with multiple types, which is not possible with standard arrays. I want to use it as in the following example:</p>  <pre><code>mat[cv::Point(i,j)][cv::Point(k,l)] = 5.0f; </code></pre>  <p>I would appreciate some help.</p>
