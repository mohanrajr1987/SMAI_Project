<p>We have this weird hacky workaround involving writing to an index that is dated in the future.</p>  <p>I'm trying to set up logstash in order to do this, but I'm not even sure if its possible.</p>  <pre><code>                      elasticsearch {                            index =&gt; "logstash-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}"                   } </code></pre>  <p>Is there a way to modify this to so that I simultaneously write to an index that is also 7 days in the future?</p>
