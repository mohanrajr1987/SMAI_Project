<p>I am trying to search for tweets relating to certain keywords,for ex tweets for keyword 'x' 'y' 'z' . Now I want to have these tweets in a sorted order with tweet that matched the most keyword first and which matched the least in the end.</p>  <p>What i have tried to do till now is that i have used the <a href="https://twitter.com/search-advanced?lang=en" rel="nofollow">https://twitter.com/search-advanced?lang=en</a>  advanced search feature on twitter</p>  <p>with the option "Any of these words" but it provides content that is too unsorted for me to use and generally returns result with at most one or two matching keywords when result that have all the matched keywords exist(as shown by search using option "All of these words") I ll be using python for this ahead ,if it matters</p>  <p>What would be a good way to achieve this?</p>  <p>Is there a service on the web that can map keywords to twitter hashtags?</p>
