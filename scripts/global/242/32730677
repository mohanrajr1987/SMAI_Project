<p>i have a file in hdfs system which is the output of join of 3 tables related to sales data. (sales header, item detail,tender detail).</p>  <p>The file will have columns from all the three tables combined.</p>  <p>If there are 3 items and 1 tender , i will have 6 rows for a transaction. So there will be 6 lines in the file with same transaction number. I can read this in mapper and create a DTO with all the fields</p>  <p>Now i want to construct the complex DTO structure out of this flattened DTO.  Is there any pojo mapping framework available for this and will it support maping from a plain DTO to a complex structure.</p>  <p>Structure</p>  <pre><code>public class PlainDTO{  String tranId; String processDate; String itemNumber; String itemName; int tenderId; ....... ......   } </code></pre>  <p>From List, i need to convert to below structure</p>  <pre><code>public class ComplexDTO{  private SlsHeader slsHeader; private Collection&lt;SlsItems&gt; items; private Collection&lt;SlsTender&gt; tenderDetails  } </code></pre>
