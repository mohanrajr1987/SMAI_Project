<p>I have implemented a table called <code>schedules</code>, it has a field called <code>day</code>.<br> day is <code>tinyInteger</code> datatype and represents a day of week like Saturday or Wednesday.<br> As of getting query and presenting to the view how do I convert <code>tinyInt</code> to a representational <code>String</code>?<br> Also I'm concerned about MVC architecture as representing a day's string is related to the view and not model itself, so what's your opinion about creating a helper class and converting integer to string there?</p>
