<p>I'm evaluating Altus mapping engine (<a href="http://ba3.us/" rel="nofollow">http://ba3.us/</a>) for my Android project. Overview, it work well but except for draw polygon.</p>  <p>Whenever the function addPolygonToVectorMap() called, the app will be freeze-ed for more than 20s. </p>  <p>Note: my polygon data quite large, more than 15k points (locations) for each, and i have 4 polygon like that. But i have to say that, this data draw well on some other mapping engine like mapbox, g3m, google...</p>  <p>Do you have any suggestion please? I really need help on this.</p>
