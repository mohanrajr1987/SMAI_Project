<p>In my WPF app, the user should be able to manipulate an IDictionary from the UI. Is there a built-in control that handles this? </p>  <p>Requirements: </p>  <ul> <li>Simple view of all pairs (e.g. as a table)</li> <li>User can add a pair to the list</li> <li>User can remove a pair from the list</li> <li>User can edit the value of a pair</li> <li>No two pairs in the list can have the same key</li> </ul>  <p>I'm sure this could be built as a custom control; I want to know if I can leverage existing work. </p>
