<p>I'm updating from Coldbox 3.8.1 to coldbox 4.1.0 and the error I keep getting is:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Error importing routes configuration file: Could not find the   included template config/Routes.cfm. Note: If you wish to use an   absolute template path (for example, template="/mypath/index.cfm")   with include, you must create a mapping for the path using the   ColdFusion Administrator. Or, you can use per-application settings to   specify mappings specific to this application by specifying a mappings   struct to THIS.mappings in Application.cfc. <br> Using relative paths   (for example, template="index.cfm" or template="../index.cfm") does   not require the creation of any special mappings. It is therefore   recommended that you use relative paths with include whenever   possible.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Here's the thing though, in order for it to throw that error it checks to make sure the file exists with a <code>fileExists(expandPath(config/Routes.cfm))</code> as well as I have manually checked and saw the file does in fact exist. I've tried changing the location for where it's looking and also using an absolute path adding the mapping to CF but it keeps popping up with this error. Any ideas on why if the file does exist, and CF can see it why it says it can't?</p>
