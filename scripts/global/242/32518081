<p>I have let my system run with dynamic mapping for a while.<br> It created a huge index form all of my entity data (current and history ) Many fields that I wouldn't like to index are being index.   </p>  <p>So, I thought to change it to static mapping.<br> This way I would set only thte fields I need, My problem is that:  </p>  <ol> <li><p>The index is still very big, but that's ok.  </p></li> <li><p>In dynamic mapping a lot of definitions are now written in one place -  the template (using matcher).<br> In static mapping I will not be able to define it in one place. </p></li> </ol>  <p>Changing a behavior in static mapping will require me to change it in multiple places.</p>  <p>Is there a way to apply a template behaviour in static mapping?<br> When is it considered a good practice to use static mapping?  </p>
