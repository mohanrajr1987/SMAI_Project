<p>I have a Excel question. How do I sum the numbers in a column which has -1, 1, -2, 3, 1 in a way that it shows me two separate results? Here is the example of my desired ouput:</p>  <pre><code>week    az  ca  tx   week1   1    3   1 week2  -1   -1  -2 week3   1   -1   1  win     2    3   2 loss    1    2   2 </code></pre>  <p>i tried to use the auto sum in Excel but it gives me something like this:</p>  <pre><code>win     1    1   0 </code></pre>  <p>could someone with Excel (does not mater what version) expertise help please? i tried the =if(true value, and false but it does not work)</p>  <p>Thanks a lot.
