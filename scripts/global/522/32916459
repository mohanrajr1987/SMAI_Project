<p>Been having a trivial issue for a few days now.  All I need to do is read in data in a PivotTable, and save in a new excel file (and add another couple cells but thats not the problem).</p>  <p>I've been trying to read the data in using the Pandas library for python (3.4) but its not accessing all of the data that I need.</p>  <p>Does anyone know how to effectively read in cells from a Pivot Table? Or just convert to a normal table... that would fix my problems</p>  <p>Thanks guys, any help is appreciated.</p>
