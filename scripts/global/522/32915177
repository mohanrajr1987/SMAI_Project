<p>I have two spreadsheets I am dealing with</p>  <ol> <li>Current Months Percent Complete</li> <li>Last Months Percent Complete</li> </ol>  <p>I need to get the Revenue and Cost information from the Last Months Percent Complete spreadsheet and put it into the Current Months Percent Complete spreadsheet.  On the Current Spreadsheet there is a field where the user enters the month the current spreadsheet is and then another field subtracts one month from that date and calculates what the Last Months Percent Complete spreadsheets' name.  ( =TEXT(C2,"YYYYMM")&amp;"PercComp.xlsx" )</p>  <p>So I am trying to get the following function to work where the value of the argument DATA!$D$2 is the function above.  </p>  <p>=INDEX('[DATA!$D$2]CO 10'!$B$9:$AL$1048576,MATCH(B9,'[DATA!$D$2]CO 10'!$B$9:$B$1048576,0),18)</p>  <p>What happens with this is that every time I copy this function it wants me to select the file from the Update Values box.  I want to avoid this if at all possible.</p>  <p>Hope this makes sense.</p>
