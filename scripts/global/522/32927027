<p>Assuming i have 4 goods: Apple, Banana, Carrots, Durians and i have 50,30,20,20 respectively</p>  <p>and i have 3 storage cabinets: Box 1, Box 2, Box 3 each with a capacity of 35, 56, 40 and each box can only contain 1 type of fruit.</p>  <p>Assuming the profit of the following fruits are 7,5,6,8 respectively. </p>  <p>Due to weight considerations to load the fruits onto my truck, Box 2 have to be between 40 to 60% of the total weight. Box 1 have to be 85 to 115% of Box 3. How do I solve this question. I have tried doing it using solver but so far I am only familiar with constraints that have a fixed value. such as Apple &lt;= 50. How do i go about the weight considerations, that have a dynamic RHS. </p>
