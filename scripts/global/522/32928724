<p>I have worked on several projects now where I have been stumped by MS Excel and MS Access where I cannot use VBA to manipulate objects whilst in design view. They are very simple tasks such as changing the name of the labels on a userform in MS Excel or adding new textboxes to a report in MS Access but they seem to be impossible as any macro will only be used upon activation of said userform or report and so everything is just done in runtime.</p>  <p>To focus on one, In MS Excel I want to be able to run a code which will go through all the labels on my userform and rename them from "Label1", "Label2", etc... to "Lbl1", "Lbl2", etc... for instance but I cannot just click a button to run a macro on the design of the userform which would run through all the labels and change their names. If I am able to do this then I can be much more efficent with the rest of my runtime code. Without it, I have the option of renaming every single label I have but there are near 100 labels and I want to do this through VBA as I already can see that it would be very useful to know how to run code in design view of these Visual Basic elements.</p>  <p>Please could you advise whether it is possible to manipulate these VB objects in design view?</p>
