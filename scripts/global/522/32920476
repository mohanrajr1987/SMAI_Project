<p>Excel offers the possibility to paste a chart format to another chart (in a chart sheet) through the PasteSpecial.</p>  <p>Recording the procedure as a macro gives the following code:</p>  <pre><code>Sub Macro4()    ActiveChart.ChartArea.Select    ActiveChart.PasteSpecial Format:=2 End Sub </code></pre>  <p>Trying to run it fails (method not found).</p>  <p>I am referring here to the chart sheet and not the embedded chart.</p>  <p>Please advise.</p>
