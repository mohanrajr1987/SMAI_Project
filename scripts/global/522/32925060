<p>I have two column (A,B), both contains 10 rows (A1-A10, B1-B10).</p>  <p>On A I have the amount 7000 and on A2 its 5000. On B1 I have 1500, on B2 I have 500, on A3 its 700, on A4 its 1100 and on A5 its 900.</p>  <p>On A10 I have the formula: =SUM(A1:A9) On B10 I have the formula: =SUM(B1:B9) Both the balance should be equal, to do that I want to put a formula on B9 which will be the amount that is needed to equal the balance.</p>  <p>What I have tried so far is: =A10-SUM(B1:B8) That works fine. But I want to know that is there any other way to do it?</p>
