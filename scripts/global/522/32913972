<p>I have a SharePoint drive mapped to W:\ and I want to do things, save the results to a new workbook on SharePoint, and verify that the upload was successful.  I get wildly inconsistent behavior on any test I do on the save path.  Usually it fails on the first attempt, but if I run the entire sub again immediately after it succeeds; sometimes it works on the first try. I've built delays in to give SP an opportunity to update and watched the directory in Windows Explorer while the code is running, so I can verify it exists before it times out/fails.</p>  <p>I had the end of this rearranged several times trying to make it work on the first run every time (e.g. continually testing the path until exists or timeout, Application.Wait instead, longer timers, etc.) and eventually excised everything but a fixed timer. Even stripped down to "just wait 15s, then check" I get the same behavior.  Am I missing a trick here, or is it just VBA/SP Things and I have to live with it?</p>  <pre><code>Dim timeout As Variant Dim save_path_share, file_name, test_str As String `/// do stuff &amp; export workbook to mapped SharePoint drive at save_path_share\file_name.xlsx timeout = TimeValue(Now + TimeValue("00:00:15")) Do Until TimeValue(Now) &gt;= timeout Loop test_str = Dir(save_path_share &amp; file_name &amp; ".xlsx")  Application.ScreenUpdating = True  If test_str &lt;&gt; "" Then   '/// do more stuff/// </code></pre>
