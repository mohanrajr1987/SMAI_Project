<p>Hey I'm trying to create a Macro to sort customer data which is organized with a header ("CUSTOMER:ABC") in column A followed by rows of data about that customer and finally a total header in column A ("TOTAL") with total data along that row. This is repeated for the whole list of customers. What I want to do is create a Macro that simulates drag copying the customer name down to (and including) the cell with total header. I don't need to move any of the data, just need to fill all of column A with customer names.  </p>  <p>Ex.<br> 1. CUSTOMER: ABC<br> 2.<br> 3.<br> 4. TOTAL<br> 5. CUSTOMER: XYZ<br> 6.<br> 7. TOTAL<br> Change to:<br> 1. CUSTOMER: ABC<br> 2. CUSTOMER: ABC<br> 3. CUSTOMER: ABC<br> 4. CUSTOMER: ABC<br> 5. CUSTOMER: XYZ<br> 6. CUSTOMER: XYZ<br> 7. CUSTOMER: XYZ  </p>
