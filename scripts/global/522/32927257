<p>I know nothing about Excel (technically I'm using "Calc" in Open Office).  I'm trying to set up a cell to auto-update with a date/time stamp if another cell has data entered into it with this code...</p>  <pre><code>=IF(AND(D14&lt;&gt;"";D14&lt;&gt;0);format(NOW(), "mmm. dd, yyyy @ h:nn am/pm");"") </code></pre>  <p>I want the date/time stamp to be like this: <strong>Oct. 3, 2015 @ 10:30am</strong></p>  <p>When I try the code above I get "ERR: 508" in the cell.</p>  <p>Any help is appreciated.</p>
