<p>I am currently refreshing many excel files using Macro Code. My Macro code locates the folder path, opens the excel file one by one and refresh the excel file. My each excel file is having web connection to one website and loads the refreshed data into the same excel file. My problem is that each file takes around 5 minutes to refresh and get the data back loaded. I have around 300 excel files which screws my time. This is because each file is refreshed serially. Is there any way to refresh all the excel files Parallely ?  </p>
