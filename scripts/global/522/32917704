<p>I have created a program that would add employees from the userform to the Excel sheet. By using the Offset property, I can add employees to the next range of cells. But how do I limit the number of employees I can add? Like if I have already employed 10 employees (limit is 10 employees) then I have entered a data in userform so I can employ the 11th employee, a msgbox will appear and data would not send to excel sheet. I have tried an <code>If</code> condition statement but doesn't work.</p>
