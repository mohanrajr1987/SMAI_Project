<pre><code>Sheet1= master field that I am trying to copy the content from the other sheets Sheet2= Distributor1 Column A has UPC Column B Price Column C Shipping Price Sheet3= Distributor2 Column A has UPC Column B Price Column C Shipping Price </code></pre>  <p>In Sheet 1 I would like to paste/copy ALL UPC between sheet 2 and sheet 3. If there is a duplicate (comparing UPC) I would like the lesser of the two transferred over (less of the two column B price not worried about shipping).</p>  <p>I have been trying this all day and cannot get it. Tried copying all UPC to Sheet 1 from both sheets marked the duplicates i just can't get it to work so I don't have duplicated products. Any ideas what would be the easier way and a possible solution?</p>
