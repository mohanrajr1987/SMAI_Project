<p>I am viewing consensus fantasy football projection data for individual players at this URL: </p>  <p><a href="http://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/projections/qb.php?max-yes=true&amp;min-yes=true" rel="nofollow">Sub-optimal projection data format</a></p>  <p>However, in the top right corner there is an "Export" link to the same data in a cleaner format. This link prompts the user to save the data to an .xls file. This is the data that I would like to read into R. I am not sure whether I would be able to read it in directly from the URL, or have R save it to an excel file and then read it in. I have no preference, as long as I do not have to manually save each excel file, as I plan on doing this frequently.</p>  <p>My question is, how can I create an automated process in R where I enter the export to excel URL and then read that data into R?</p>  <p><a href="http://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/projections/qb.php?export=xls&amp;week=4&amp;min-yes=true&amp;max-yes=true" rel="nofollow">Preferred projection data format</a> (this a prompt to save to .xls)</p>  <pre><code>library("gdata") qb_url &lt;- "http://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/projections/qb.php?export=xls&amp;week=4&amp;min-yes=true&amp;max-yes=true" download.file(qb_url, "qb.xls") </code></pre>  <p>I am now trying a read.table function and skipping the first 5-6 rows, however, since the first column is full names, sometimes with suffices, it is splitting the names into three separate columns, while I want them in just one character column. I've tried StringsAsFactors = FALSE and other pieces of code, but to no avail. I am reading through the read.table documentation websites, but I am not able to see what I am doing wrong/missing.</p>
