<p>I have spent hours trying to think of a solution to this so I give us and ask for help!!</p>  <p>I have different products (in cells A2 to A10) which are different terms. The description in the cell is 'Bake 5 year award' or it could be 'Style 3 year award'.</p>  <p>I need to use the search function to determine whether of not it is a 3 or 5 year product and then based on that, I need it to copy the term '3 year' or '5 year' to another workbook i.e. not copy over the other words in the description e.g Bake. </p>
