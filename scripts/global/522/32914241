<p>I am downloading 43 stock symbols historical pricing into excel 2013.  my code uses a 2d array which is then transposed and inserted into a sheet.  It works fine, until I try and download pricing going back to 1990 for the 43 symobls.  It seems that once the second dimension of the array gets over a certain amount the cell value turns to #N/A as some point down column one.  Any thoughts on a jagged array (nested array) but how would I loop through to make the output range I need?  thanks for all the suggestions.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>RERFX RFNCX   RWICX   SASMX   SGRKX   SGRKX   SMGIX   TRSGX   VETAX   VIMAX   VINIX   VIPSX   VSCAX   WACPX   WAPAX   WASAX   5/15/2002   6/4/2002    6/6/2002    1/1/2001    8/30/2002   8/30/2002   1/1/2001    1/1/2001    5/5/2000    11/12/2001  1/1/2001    6/29/2000   1/1/2001    1/1/2001    5/21/2012   5/21/2012</p> </blockquote>  <p>These are the symbols and the dates. I created a range for all the symbols and then created the start dates by making ranges out of the symbols themselves.</p>  <pre><code>Sub GetDailyReturnsTest() Dim URL As String, today As String, http As Object, csv As String, temp() As String Dim txt As String, r As Integer, a As Single, b As String, s As Double, ticker As Variant, icountSymbol As Integer, sTicker As String Dim iSymbol As Integer, dateParams As String, t As Double, sym As range  Application.ScreenUpdating = False    Set ticker = Application.[fundsymbols] icountSymbol = ticker.Count  ReDim temp(8, 0)  today = Date For Each sym In ticker dateParams = "&amp;a=" &amp; Month(range(sym)) - 1 &amp; "&amp;b=" &amp; Day(range(sym)) &amp; "&amp;c=" &amp; Year(range(sym)) &amp; "&amp;d=" &amp; Month(Now) &amp; "&amp;e=" &amp; Day(Now) &amp; "&amp;f=" &amp; Year(Now)      sTicker = ticker(1, iSymbol)  URL = "http://ichart.finance.yahoo.com/table.csv?s=" &amp; sTicker &amp; dateParams &amp; "g=d&amp;ignore=.csv"   On Error Resume Next  Set http = CreateObject("msxml2.xmlhttp") http.Open "get", URL, False http.send csv = http.ResponseText r = 0 txt = "" For a = 1 To Len(csv) b = Mid(csv, a, 1) If b = "," Then     temp(r, UBound(temp, 2)) = txt     r = r + 1     txt = "" ElseIf b = Chr(10) Then temp(r, UBound(temp, 2)) = txt r = r + 1 txt = sTicker temp(r, UBound(temp, 2)) = txt ReDim Preserve temp(UBound(temp, 1), UBound(temp, 2) + 1) txt = "" r = 0 Else     txt = txt &amp; b End If Next a Next sym Worksheets("FundsHistoricalPricing").Activate On Error Resume Next   With ActiveSheet.Cells .ClearContents .ClearFormats End With  range("a2").Resize(UBound(temp, 2) + 1, UBound(temp, 1)).Value = Application.Transpose(temp) end sub </code></pre>
