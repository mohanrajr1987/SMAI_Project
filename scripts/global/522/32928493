<p>I am trying to figure out how to loop through the first column of my worksheet and take out the spaces so I can use VLOOKUP. Not sure how to do it in VBA. Here is what I have:</p>  <p>I can't figure out why it does not go onto the next sheet now? I can't just cycle through all of the sheets since they are different. </p>  <pre><code>Sub trima() Dim x As Integer Dim numrows As Long         numrows = Range("A1",Range("A1").End(xlDown)).Rows.Count        Range("A1").Select        For x = 1 To numrows          Application.WorksheetFunction.trim (ActiveCell)          ActiveCell.Offset(1, 0).Select       Next End Sub </code></pre>
