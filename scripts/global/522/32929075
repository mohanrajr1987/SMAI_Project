<p>I just got my office updated from 2010 to 2013. The code below works perfectly with 2010 libraries while it fails on 2013 office. This error comes on both visual studio 2012 as well as on visual studio 2015</p>  <pre><code>    Excel.ChartObject chart3d = charts.Item("Chart3D1");     SeriesCollection series3DCollection = chart3d.Chart.SeriesCollection();     Series series1 = series3DCollection.Item(1);     series1.FormulaR1C1 = "=SERIES(Engine!R14C15,Engine!R10C17:R10C19,Engine!R14C17:R14C19,1)"; </code></pre>  <p>What stumps me though, regular formula works. but it again throws an error if later on R1C1 formula is applied to itself.i.e.</p>  <pre><code>    series1.Formula = "=SERIES(Engine!$O$14,Engine!$Q$10:$S$10,Engine!$Q$14:$S$14,1)"; </code></pre>  <p>above works perfectly and it also sets up series1.FormulaR1C1 correctly. i.e. </p>  <pre><code>    string newR1C1 = s.FormulaR1C1; </code></pre>  <p>sets newR1C1 to be "=SERIES(Engine!R14C15,Engine!R10C17:R10C19,Engine!R14C17:R14C19,1)"</p>  <p>So now, if I try</p>  <pre><code>    s.FormulaR1C1 = newR1C1; </code></pre>  <p>it again throws the same error.</p>  <p>Note: I have to update lots of charts in the file and using FormulaR1C1 is tremendously fast as compare to using the Formula property as later one activate the chart series on the formulla bar of excel and it updates every series making it a very slow process ( I am updating close to 20 charts in the file and each chart has up to 40 series in it).</p>
