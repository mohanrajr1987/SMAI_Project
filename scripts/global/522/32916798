<p>This might fall under the dumb question from a newbie. But I honestly don't know where to start in VBA. I tried a few different approaches on the web trying to pull data from the site I'm trying to and all of them failed miserably. Can someone help me (more or less show me) how to pull the data from this website? </p>  <p><a href="https://rotogrinders.com/projected-stats/nfl?site=fanduel" rel="nofollow">https://rotogrinders.com/projected-stats/nfl?site=fanduel</a></p>  <p>It wouldn't even let me do the data->import. here is what I have so far. I keep getting stuck on line For t = 0 To (Table.Length - 1).</p>  <pre><code>Sub test1() Dim appIE As Object Set appIE = CreateObject("internetexplorer.application") Dim Table As Object Dim t As Integer Dim r As Integer Dim c As Integer  With appIE     .Navigate "https://rotogrinders.com/projected-stats/nfl?site=fanduel"     .Visible = True End With  Do While appIE.Busy     DoEvents Loop  Set Table = appIE.document.getElementById("proj-stats") For t = 0 To (Table.Length - 1)     For r = 0 To (Table(t).Rows.Length - 1)         For c = 0 To (Table(t).Rows(r).Cells.Length - 1)  ThisWorkbook.Worksheets(1).Cells(r + 1, c + 1) = Table(t).Rows(r).Cells(c).innerText     Next c     Next r     Next t  appIE.Quit Set appIE = Nothing   End Sub </code></pre>
