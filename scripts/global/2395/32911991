<p>I have a hierarchical query in SQL and i want to convert it into HiveQL. I know that hive does not support hierarchical queries. How should i convert the below SQL query to HivqQL?</p>  <pre><code>SELECT last_name, employee_id, manager_id, LEVEL       FROM employees       START WITH employee_id = 100       CONNECT BY PRIOR employee_id = manager_id       ORDER SIBLINGS BY last_name; </code></pre>
