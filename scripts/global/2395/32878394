<p>In my query below, I am trying to bring back the top 750 order IDs (by CTR) for each week. </p>  <p>Not the top 750 out of all weeks.  I can't figure out how to do that. </p>  <pre><code>select "topctrbyQ32015", weekofyear(day),order_id, (sum(clicks)/sum(impressions)) as ctr from RDZ_TABLE rdz where day &gt;= '2015-07-06' and day &lt;= '2015-09-27' group by "topctrbyQ32015", weekofyear(day),order_id order by ctr desc limit 750; </code></pre>
