<p>I am new to Hive queries. I had initially done hive setup using VMWare on another laptop and everything was working fine. I took VM snapshot of the VM Ware and installed on another laptop. Now running Hive queries gives me a time out exception as mentioned below pointing to stale IP address (IP address on my prev laptop) . </p>  <p>Error: "Failed with exception java.io.IOException:java.net.SocketTimeoutException: Call to 192.XX.XX.134/192.XX.XX.134:8020 failed on socket timeout exception:"</p>
