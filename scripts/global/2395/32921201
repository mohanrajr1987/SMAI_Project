<p>I want to load Hive tables using Pig. I think we can do this through <strong><code>HCatLoader</code></strong> but I am using xml files to load pig. For this, I have to use <strong><code>XMLLoader</code></strong>. Can I use two options to load XML files in Pig.</p>  <p>I am extracting data from XML files using my own UDF and once we extract all the data, I have to load Pig data in Hive tables. </p>  <p>I can't use HIVE to extract the XML data as the XML I received is quite complex and I wrote my own UDF to parse the XML. Any suggestions or pointers how we can load Hive tables using PIG data.</p>
