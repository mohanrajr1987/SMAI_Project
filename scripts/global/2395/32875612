<p>I know I can get the AST using the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17085119/how-to-convert-a-hive-query-into-abstract-syntax-tree">explain extended command</a>. My question is, how to get the same using the Java API.  My goal is to get the following data about queries: </p>  <ul> <li>Database source and target (if applied).</li> <li>Table source and target (if applied).</li> <li>Fields involved in the query.</li> </ul>  <p>I know I can get them above data directly from query string using Regex, but I want to use Java API.  Do you have any other idea how to do that? </p>
