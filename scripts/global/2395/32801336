<p>I am not asking why Hive is slow to process a single query, which has already been answered on the Web, for instance <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16359337/hadoop-hive-slow-queries">here</a>.</p>  <p>I am asking why Hive is slow to <em>start</em>...</p>  <pre><code>$ mkdir hivetest $ cd hivetest/ $ time hive -e "exit;"  Logging initialized using configuration in ...  real    0m37.052s user    0m45.111s sys     0m1.600s </code></pre>  <p>Is it dependent of my particular configuration? How can I debug this?</p>
