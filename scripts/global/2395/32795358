<p>I have two tables with some similar columns. Say,<br> <code>Table X</code> has <code>id,first_name last_name</code>.<br> <code>Table Y</code> has <code>id,email_id, first_name</code>. </p>  <p>However both these tables are imperfect, so I need to fill in the null values in both the tables from the data in the other table(using some key(id in the eg)) and push it to another table.</p>  <p>How can I do this efficiently ?</p>
