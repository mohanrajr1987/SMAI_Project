<p>I tested Hive with the following queries:</p>  <pre><code>create table test (key string, value string) stored as orc; insert into table test values ('a','a'), ('b','b'); select key, count(*) from test group by key; </code></pre>  <p>And I got the out-of-memory error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Error: Failure while running task:java.lang.RuntimeException: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space   at org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.exec.tez.TezProcessor.initializeAndRunProcessor(TezProcessor.java:157)   at org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.exec.tez.TezProcessor.run(TezProcessor.java:137)</p> </blockquote>  <p>I have searched online, but people usually got this error when they were working on some bigger files. In my case, the file only has two rows, and my computer has 14G memory.</p>  <p>I have set /etc/hadoop/conf/hadoop-env.sh HADOOP_HEAPSIZE to 1024. It does not work.</p>
