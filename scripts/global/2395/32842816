<p>I have two tables with identical columns, I want to find out records which are present in first table but not present in second table. The key between two tables is composite of three columns. I am writing a Hive query like below: </p>  <pre><code>*  Select a.x,b.y from table_1 a left outer join table_2 b on     a.c1=b.c1 and a.c2=b.c2 and a.c3=b.c3     where isnull(b.c1) or isnull(b.c2) or isnull(b.c3); </code></pre>  <p>*</p>  <p>Is this query correct for the purpose ? If there are 100 records in table_1 and out of which 50 match with table_2 will the result have remaining 50 rows from table_1 or more, as I am taking join on more than one attribute and using 'OR' in where condition.</p>
