<p>I encountered a strange HIVE behavior which i can not completely understand.  I really hope someone could shad some light on that matter. </p>  <p>I am using the following script to create and add data to a table:</p>  <pre><code>DROP TABLE myTbl; CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE myTbl (     Col1 string,     Col2 string,       Col3 string,     Col4  string, ) PARTITIONED BY (partition STRING) LOCATION '${hiveconf:Valid_location_on_aws_s3_with_the_proper_file_to_create_table}'; </code></pre>  <p>Hive runs the script returns OK but (Here is the problem) the table is empty. run: <code>select * from myTbl;</code> returns nothing </p>  <p>The solution for this problem was rather simple after the script i run the following command/script:</p>  <p><code>MSCK REPAIR TABLE myTbl</code></p>  <p>now when executing select on that table i can see all the data that was in the file.</p>  <p>What i can not understand is why I need to use the repair in order to see the data in the table.</p>  <p>P.S. using the LOAD INTO TABLE works perfectly without any need to repair.</p>
