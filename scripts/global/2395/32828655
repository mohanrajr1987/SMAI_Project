<p>I want to do this:</p>  <pre><code>query = 'SELECT * FROM table WHERE a = ? AND b &gt;= ? AND b &lt;= ?'   params = ('x', 'y', 'z')   cursor.execute(query, params)   </code></pre>  <p>But what gets delivered to Hive looks pretty much like this, with the order of the fields changed in the WHERE clause:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT * FROM table T WHERE T.b &lt;= 'x' AND T.a = 'y' AND T.b &gt;= 'z' </code></pre>  <p><code>execute()</code> works fine with a single parameter, and <code>executemany()</code> works as expected. Any ideas on what's happening here and how to correct it?</p>  <p>I have a workaround, below, but I know it's not the most secure approach.</p>  <pre><code>params = ('x', 'y', 'z') query = "SELECT * FROM table WHERE a = '%s' AND b &gt;= '%s' AND b &lt;= '%s'" % params cursor.execute(query) </code></pre>
