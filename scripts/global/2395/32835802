<p>I am new to hadoop, can someone please suggest me how to upload millions of records to hadoop? Can I do this with hive and where can I see my hadoop records?</p>  <p>Until now I have used hive for creation of the database on hadoop and I am accessing it with localhost 50070. But I am unable to load data from csv file to hadoop from terminal. As it is giving me error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>FAILED: Error in semantic analysis: Line 2:0 Invalid path ''/user/local/hadoop/share/hadoop/hdfs'': No files matching path hdfs://localhost:54310/usr/local/hadoop/share/hadoop/hdfs</p> </blockquote>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZGzOR.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZGzOR.png" alt="EROOR IN THE TERMINAL:"></a></p>  <p>Can anyone suggest me some way to resolve it?</p>
