<p>I have a website with a basic bootstrap carousel (no next/previous buttons, titles, etc.) that changes through 20 images.  I would like it to randomly select an image from a folder each time instead of me listing each image in the HTML.  The goal is to be able to upload images to this folder at any time and they would now be available to be selected at random to appear on the website.  This would be much more convenient to update especially if the client wants hundreds of pictures to potentially show in this carousel.  Thanks!</p>
