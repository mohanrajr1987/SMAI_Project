<p>I am building a query that I want to  *order by last name *limit by certain rows .. IE  limit 0 , 15  and next query limit 15 offset 16 *randomize the 15 row that I have queried.</p>  <p>my query will kinda do this, when I run the next query it will pull rows from the first set for some reason.  </p>  <pre><code>1stQ:  select ..... from table  order by table.lastname, rand() Limit 0, 15 </code></pre>  <p>2ndQ: </p>  <pre><code>    select ..... from table order by table.lastname, rand(), limit 15 offset 16 </code></pre>
