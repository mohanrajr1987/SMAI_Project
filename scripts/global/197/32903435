<p>I want to pick A, B or C by given weights. </p>  <p>Let's say: </p>  <pre><code>A has 0.2 weight  B has 0.2 weight  C has 0.6 weight </code></pre>  <p>However, If key1 picks A at first run, I want it to keep A for key1 all the time.</p>  <p>And I have unique key for all entries say: </p>  <pre><code>key1: xxxxx-00000-zzzz key2: zzzzz-00000-yyyy </code></pre>  <p>Each key is unique with no duplicate. </p>  <p>Is there a way to pick with weights but same pick all the time given some unique key? </p>
