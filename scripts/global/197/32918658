<p>Here is the reference implementation and I do not understand why choose 21 here? Thanks.</p>  <pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>public static int rand7() {     while (true) {         int num = 5 * (rand5() - 1) + (rand5() - 1);         if (num &lt; 21) return (num % 7 + 1);     } } </code></pre>  <p>BTW, I read that question before asking, my specific question is why using 21 here. In that thread, it is not answered. If I missed anything, please feel free to correct. Thanks. :) thanks in advance, Lin</p>
