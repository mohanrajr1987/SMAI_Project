<p>I want to draw a number of random variables from a series of distributions. However, the values returned have to be no higher than a certain threshold. Letâ€™s say I want to use the gamma distribution and the threshold is 10 and I need n=100 random numbers. I now want 100 random number between 0 and 10. (Say scale and shape are 1.)</p>  <p>Getting 100 random variables is obviously easy...</p>  <pre><code>rgamma(100, shape = 1, rate = 1) </code></pre>  <p>But how can I accomplish that these values range from 0 to 100?</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong> To make my question clearer. The 100 values drawn should be <em>scaled</em> beween 0 and 10. So that the highest drawn value is 10 and the lowest 0. Sorry if this was not clear... </p>  <p><strong>EDIT No2</strong> To add some context to the random numbers I need: I want to draw "system repair times" that follow certain distributions. However, within the system simulation there is a binomial probability of repairs beeing "simple" (i.e. short repair time) and "complicated" (i.e. long repair time). I now need a function that provides "short repair times" and one that provides "long repair times". The threshold would be the differentiation between short and long repair times. Again, I hope this makes my question a little clearer.</p>
