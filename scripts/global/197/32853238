<p>I want to generate 5 random normal variables in r each with given mean and sd</p>  <pre><code>x1 &lt;- rnorm(100,20,5) x2 &lt;- rnorm(100,22,4) y1 &lt;- rnorm(100,21,3) y2 &lt;- rnorm(100,23,4) y3 &lt;- rnorm(100,22,5) </code></pre>  <p>and with summated scales x and y having a predefined correlation as</p>  <pre><code>x &lt;- rowSums(cbind(x1,x2)) y &lt;- rowSums(cbind(y1,y2,y3)) cor(x,y) # must be about 0.6 </code></pre>  <p>I think using a loop should be an inefficient solution for this. also <code>y=r*x+sqrt(1-r*r)*rnorm(n)</code> was not applicable. I'm a bit confused how to start. any suggestion would be greatly appreciated.</p>
