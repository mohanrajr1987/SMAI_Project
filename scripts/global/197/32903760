<p>I want to (pseudo) randomly position a number points on a grid. Think of it as 10 x 10 chessboard with 100 squares) And think of these points as pawns on the chessboard, that occupy one square each. What I want is for the pawns to be "evenly" distributed over the board. The middle-square method is fine for generating the random numbers.</p>  <pre><code>00  01  02  03  04  05  06  07  08  09 10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19 20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29 30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39 40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49 50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  ...  </code></pre>  <p>My problem that is that if I store the grid squares as list, and draw them from top left to bottom right, then square 9 is not next to 10, as you would expect. 10, is next to 0 &amp; 20. What's the best way around this?</p>
