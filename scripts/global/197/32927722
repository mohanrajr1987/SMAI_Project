<p>C++11 introduced the header <code>&lt;random&gt;</code> with declarations for random number engines and random distributions. That's great - time to replace those uses of <code>rand()</code> which is often problematic in various ways. However, it seems far from obvious how to replace</p>  <pre><code>srand(n); // ... int r = rand(); </code></pre>  <p>Based on the declarations it seems a uniform distribution can be built something like this:</p>  <pre><code>std::default_random_engine engine; engine.seed(n); std::uniform_int_distribution&lt;&gt; distribution; auto rand = [&amp;](){ return distribution(engine); } </code></pre>  <p>This approach seems rather involved and is surely something I won't remember unlike the use of <code>srand()</code> and <code>rand()</code>. I'm aware of <a href="http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/papers/2015/n4531.html">N4531</a> but even that still seems to be quite involved.</p>  <p>Is there a reasonably simple way to replace <code>srand()</code> and <code>rand()</code>?</p>
