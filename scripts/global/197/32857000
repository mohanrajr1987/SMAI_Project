<pre><code>public String[] words={"cat", "dog", "rodeo", "bird", "lookers", "skid"); </code></pre>  <p>. </p>  <pre><code>// Picks a random word from the dictionary, given the length of the word public String pickWord(int size) {  } </code></pre>  <p>So if a user inputs 4, it randomly chooses a word in the word array with 4 letters, and randomly. I have created a rand variable from the Random class for that. So how do I choose an element in the array with the same number of letters as the number the user inputted. </p>
