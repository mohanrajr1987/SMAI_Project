<p>I have made a small application from a book about F#, but when I call the rand.NextDouble() method it throws a BadImageFormatException, which at first glance looks like it's something to do with images so I have NO idea what I'm supposed to do here.</p>  <p>I'm using VS community 2013 using visual F# 2013. I have 64 bit windows 7</p>  <p>I know it's the nextdouble method that's the problem through trying with a seperate let</p>  <pre><code>let create_field num_asteroids =     let lerp (x: float&lt;'u&gt;) (y:float&lt;'u&gt;) (a:float) =         x*a+y*(1.0-a)      let rand = Random()      [for i =1 to num_asteroids do         let m =             (lerp earth_mass moon_mass (rand.NextDouble()))*             1.0e-4         let x = lerp 0.0&lt;m&gt; field_size (rand.NextDouble())         let y = lerp 0.0&lt;m&gt; field_size (rand.NextDouble())         let vx = max_velocity*(rand.NextDouble()*2.0-1.0)*0.1         let vy = max_velocity*(rand.NextDouble()*2.0-1.0)*0.1         yield             {             Position = { X = x; Y = y }             Velocity = { X = vx; Y = vy }             Mass = m             Name = "a"             }     ] </code></pre>  <p>This is the errorcode:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>System.BadImageFormatException was unhandled   Message: An unhandled exception of type 'System.BadImageFormatException' occurred in Asteroid_Field_1.exe   Additional information: An attempt was made to load a program with an incorrect format.
