<p>Alright so as the title says, I need some help creating a random number generator to output 5 random digits. I have already compiled what I believed would work but I keep running into a problem and don't know how to correct it. Here is what I have:</p>  <pre><code>public class Number {     public static void main(String[] args) {         log("5 randomly generated numbers from 0 to 99");          Number randomGenerator = new Number();         for (int idx = 1; idx &lt;= 5; ++idx) {             int randomInt = randomGenerator.nextInt(100);             log("Random Number: " + randomInt);         }     }      private int nextInt(int i) {         return 1;     }      private static void log(String aMessage) {         System.out.println(aMessage);     } } </code></pre>  <p>The problem occurs with the '{return 1;} part, whenever I run it, the only number it generates is 1. I'm not sure how to correct this, any feedback is greatly appreciated.</p>
