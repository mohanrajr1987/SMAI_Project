<p>I have a code which calculates the square of a number using Gaussian distribution in python. Now my task is to calculate the variance for the same. But when I try, i keep getting error. The code is as follows:</p>  <pre><code>import random def generate_data(size):     n = 5     m =0.5     mu, sigma = n ** 2, m/3     return [random.gauss(mu, sigma) for _ in range(size)]   def average(ls):     avg =  sum(ls) / len(ls)     variance = (sum(ls) - sum(avg)) ** 2 / len(ls)      return variance </code></pre>  <p>I am not good in statistics, so I might be wrong with the formula too. and I am also a beginner in python.The error I get is</p>  <pre><code>'float' object is not iterable  </code></pre>
