<p>I've been wanting to make a text rpg for awhile now, but finally got around to starting making some objects and classes for a small prototype. I want to make a bunch of enemies, but without imputing stats for all of them individually, I decided to use java util.Random in order to generate a random int between 1-100 but when I look at the objects integers in my main test file theyre all 0. The l(); method is just a method i made without a printout in it with an object to save me some time. The stat value will give me a random number but the <code>l(goblin.health);</code> remains 0. Any advice on how to solve this?</p>  <pre><code>Random stats = new Random();  int stat = stats.nextInt(100); l(stat);  enemies goblin = new enemies(stat,stat,stat,stat); l(goblin.health); </code></pre>
