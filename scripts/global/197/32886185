<p>I have the following code:</p>  <pre><code>import random import operator  operators={"+":operator.add,            "-":operator.sub,            "X":operator.mul}  name = input(" What is Your Name ? :") score = 0 counter = 1  for question in range(0,10):     num1 = random.randint(1,13)     num2 = random.randint(1,13)     ranop = random.choice(operators)     answer = operators.get(ranop,num1,num2)#operator searches in operators(DICTIONARY) for random operator and then use num1 and num2 to create a question     print("{0} {1} {2}=".format(num1,ranop,num2))     if guess==answer:           print("✔")     else:         print("✘,The answer was {0}".format(answer)) print ("{0}, You Finished! You got {1}/10".format(name.title(),score)) </code></pre>  <p>I can't find why the following error occurs:</p>  <pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>What is Your Name ? :s Traceback (most recent call last):   File "substr.py", line 15, in &lt;module&gt;     ranop = random.choice(operators)   File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/lib/python3.4/random.py", line 254, in choice     return seq[i] KeyError: 0 </code></pre>
