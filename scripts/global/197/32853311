<p>This question could be generalized to randomly creating a list of size n, containing pre-specified integers (assuming a uniform distribution).  Hopefully it would look like the following:</p>  <p>Perhaps the syntax would look something like</p>  <pre><code>randList([list of integers], size) </code></pre>  <p>which could then produce something along the lines of:</p>  <pre><code>randList([1,-1], 7) &gt;&gt;&gt; [1,-1,1,-1,-1,-1,1] #(random) </code></pre>  <p>or </p>  <pre><code>randList([2,3,4], 10) &gt;&gt;&gt; [4,3,4,2,2,4,2,3,4,3] #(random) </code></pre>  <p>I am a bit new to python and everywhere I look it is always returning a range of values between a low and a high, and not specific values.  Thanks</p>
