<p>I have random sample of 600 elements from the normal distribtion stored in a vector:   </p>  <pre><code>sample_data &lt;- rnorm(600, mean =10, sd = 6) </code></pre>  <p>I am trying to split this vector into 100 random groups of 6 entries each.<br> Doing this once is a simple proposition with the sample function:   </p>  <pre><code>group_1 &lt;- sample(6, sample_data, replace=FALSE)    </code></pre>  <p>However, if I use the sample function again there is a chance some of the entries will be re-used because they weren't deleted from the initial data.  A possible solution might be to initially store the data in a 100x6 matrix and consider each row as a "random group."</p>  <p>However, I am curious if there is a more efficient method to take consecutive samples from a dataset while ensuring no entry is sampled more than once.<br> Thanks!</p>
