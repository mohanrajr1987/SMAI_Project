<p>How does random and randomize functions work? Please help me!</p>  <pre><code>#include&lt;iostream.h&gt; #include&lt;stdlib.h&gt; const int LOW = 15; void main() {     randomize();       int POINT=10, Number;       for(int I=1; I&lt;=4; I++)       {      Number = LOW + random(POINT);              cout&lt;&lt;Number&lt;&lt;":";              POINT--;       } } </code></pre>  <p>What are the different outputs that can be predicted from this program? And How? Explain. I have got four options for this code 1) 24:23:22:21: 2) 24:25:23:21 3) 21:22:23:24 4) 22:23:21:24<br> And I haven't got any of these output, there must be a basic format or something to solve these types of programs. Please help. I have also referred to Books telling about these type of programs but I can't understand the working of these type of programs.</p>
