<p>I am upgrading from Rails 3.2 to Rails 4.2. I have the following Activerecord relationship in Rails 3: </p>  <pre><code>has_many :unique_addresses, :class_name =&gt; 'Address', :uniq =&gt; true, select: [:address_one, :address_two, :city, :state, :postal_code, :country] </code></pre>  <p>I am trying figure out the correct syntax for Rails 4. My best attempt was the following but it's not working:</p>  <pre><code>has_many :unique_addresses, -&gt; { select('address_one, address_two, city, state, postal_code, country'), distinct }, :class_name =&gt; 'Address' </code></pre>  <p>I have searched for an example of the correct syntax on how to do this but can't find anything.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
