<p>I've been trying to set up my first tests on Rails 4.2.4 but usually I use singularized table names in DBs, thus I add this line into <em>config/application.rb</em></p>  <pre><code>config.active_record.pluralize_table_names = false </code></pre>  <p>Since I've being working on Car and User models, let's assume I've already generated each scaffold, and already executed <em>rake db:test:prepare</em> so the problem begins with tests as follows:</p>  <p>In test/models/car_test.rb or user_test.rb, first I uncomment stub test "the truth" and run vanilla with the following error with <em>rake test:models</em></p>  <pre><code># Running:  EE  Finished in 0.019095s, 104.7396 runs/s, 0.0000 assertions/s.    1) Error: UserTest#test_the_truth: ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid: SQLite3::SQLException: no such table: users: DELETE FROM "users"      2) Error: CarTest#test_necessary_car_data: ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid: SQLite3::SQLException: no such table: users: DELETE FROM "users"   2 runs, 0 assertions, 0 failures, 2 errors, 0 skips </code></pre>  <p>When I run <em>rake test:controllers</em> the same ActiveRecord error shows up multiple times and I cannot fix this behaviour in any way so far.</p>  <p>Somebody else has come across with this issue? It's driving me mad...</p>  <p>PS: All development does well without any issues with singular table names, the only mess lies in testing.</p>
