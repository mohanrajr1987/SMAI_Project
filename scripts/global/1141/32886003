<p>I am trying to publish a message to pubnub channel but its not publishing on server. However its working absolutely fine on local machine. Any idea where I am doing it wrong?</p>  <pre><code>class Message &lt; ActiveRecord::Base    after_create :send_message_to_driver    def send_message_to_ABC     $pubnub.publish(         channel: "chat_ABC",         message: message     ) do |env|       puts env.parsed_response     end   end end </code></pre>  <p>$pubnub is being initialized globally for app.</p>
