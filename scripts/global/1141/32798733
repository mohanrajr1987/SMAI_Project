<p>I am new to Active Record, and, despite reading many docs, I could not find a way to do this. I know it is not the correct way of handling things, ideally the following mapping logic should exist in another table but for now this seems the simplest way to handle it. </p>  <p>I have the following information in a database, and I would like to retrieve it in a special way. I have:</p>  <pre><code>|    locations    | value | |----------------|-------| |     brazil     |   20  | |     europe     |   30  | | restoftheworld |   35  | </code></pre>  <p>I want a custom getter method or scope which checks and finds the appropriate entry. Something like this in pseudocode:</p>  <pre><code>def findbylocation(location)   if location exists      return row   elsif location.in_eu?     return row of 'europe'   else     return row of 'restoftheworld' end </code></pre>  <p>What is the best way to write this? Is it a scope or a method?</p>  <p>Note: I am using <a href="https://github.com/hexorx/countries" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/hexorx/countries</a> for the EU check so there's no problem there.</p>
