<p>I am fairly new to Rails and Ruby and I am trying to find out if the following is at all possible and if so, how to go about implementing it:</p>  <p>I have an ActiveRecord model with an array column of <code>us_states</code> (['ny', 'ca']) applicable to each instance of that model. I also have a and ActiveHash model for each state: </p>  <pre><code>class USState &lt; ActiveHash::Base   self.data = [{:id =&gt; 1, :name =&gt; "ca"}, {:id =&gt; 2, :name =&gt; "ny"}] end </code></pre>  <p>My question is: is it possible to create an association between my USState ActiveHash model and my ActiveRecord model based on each of the array values in the us_states of my ActiveRecord model and one of the values of my ActiveHash? I'd really appreciate the help with this. I would hate to have to query the array in my ActiveRecord model if I can just associate the two.</p>  <p>Hector</p>
