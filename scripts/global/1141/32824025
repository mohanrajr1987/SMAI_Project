<p>I have a model called <code>User</code>. It has two fields: <code>small_logo</code> and <code>big_logo</code>.  Those are actually <strong>different</strong> pictures, not just one resized picture.</p>  <pre><code>class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base   ...     mount_uploader :big_logo, UserLogoUploader     mount_uploader :small_logo, UserLogoUploader   ... end </code></pre>  <p>I use <code>UserLogoUploader</code> to upload this pictures.</p>  <p>And I'm running onto a bug - as long as the name of the model is the same, uploaded files get the same route, so if I try to upload two different files with same names - second one overwrites first one.</p>  <p>The obvious solution is to use different uploaders for those fields. But I don't want to create another uploader just to fix this bug - is there anything I can do to modify filename, for example, with something meaningful like the name of a formfield that submitted this file or access name of a model field that is being processed.</p>
