<p>I want to do something like the following:</p>  <pre><code>Post.count.explain # doesn't work </code></pre>  <p>This fails because <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2011/12/6/what-s-new-in-edge-rails-explain/" rel="nofollow">EXPLAIN</a> is a method on Relation and <code>Post.count</code> isn't a relation. It's just a regular integer that is the result of the query. So how could a count query be EXPLAINed?</p>
