<p>I am following Michael Hartl's tutorial.  I get the following error:</p>  <pre><code>ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound in UsersController#show Couldn't find User with 'id'=1  Extracted source (around line #155)     record = s.execute([id], self, connection).first     unless record       raise RecordNotFound, "Couldn't find #{name} with '#{primary_key}'=#{id}"     end     record   rescue RangeError </code></pre>  <p>Already have tried bundle install and restarted the server because the initial error related to the bcrypt Gemfile (using v 3.1.7).</p>  <p>Running rails console and inputing User.find(1) yields no user. However, User.all in rails c does reveal that I have one user but it has an id: 2 (the very first user I made was likely deleted during prior test runs).  </p>  <p>app/controllers/users_controller.rb</p>  <pre><code>class UsersController &lt; ApplicationController   def show  @user = User.find(params[:id])  end   def new  end end </code></pre>  <p>app/config/routes.rb     Rails.application.routes.draw do</p>  <pre><code>  get 'users/new'    root 'static_pages#home'   get 'help' =&gt; 'static_pages#help'   get 'about' =&gt; 'static_pages#about'   get 'contact' =&gt; 'static_pages#contact'   get 'signup' =&gt; 'users#new'   resources :users  end </code></pre>  <p>Currently URL/users/2 displays as expected with the debug showing:</p>  <pre><code> --- !ruby/hash:ActionController::Parameters  controller: users  action: show  id: '2' </code></pre>  <p>However, this is not the case for id: 1 since it has previously been destoryed.</p>  <p>Is it possible to even reassign an id in the database after it has been created (i.e. to a prior id like 1 or any other arbitrary assignment)?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
