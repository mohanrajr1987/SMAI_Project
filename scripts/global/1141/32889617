<p>These are obviously not my actual Models but they serve as an example. I have the following class definitions.</p>  <pre><code>class Movie &lt; ActiveRecord::Base     has_one :opening     has_one :opening_info, through: :opening end  class Opening &lt; ActiveRecord::Base     belongs_to :movie     has_one :opening_info end  class OpeningInfo &lt; ActiveRecord::Base     belongs_to :opening     # OpeningInfo has a opening_date attribute in the DB end </code></pre>  <p>I want to find all movies that have a valid Opening, a valid OpeningInfo through that Opening, and that OpeningInfo has a opening_date that is not nil. By valid I mean it exists. I have tried several expressions using joins and includes but it complains of illegal sql statements. Any ideas?</p>
