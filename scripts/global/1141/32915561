<p>I am using MySql2 in my Rails application. I am trying to make an activerecord query that returns all records that have specified fields containing a string. I have read that downcasing my input and then using <code>lower(column_name) LIKE 'string'</code> should do the trick, but <strong>this does not appear to work</strong>. My query is exactly as follows: </p>  <pre><code>search = params[:search].to_s.downcase  @current_user.patients.where("lower(last_name) LIKE ? OR lower(first_name) LIKE ? OR lower(identifier) LIKE ?", "%#{search}%", "%#{search}%", "%#{search}%") </code></pre>  <p>Let's say I have a record with the last name "Abbott". When my search param is "Abb" or "bot", this record is returned. However, when the search param is "abb" or "Bot", nothing is returned. It appears that the query is <strong>still case sensitive</strong>?? </p>  <p>I have looked all over and cannot seem to find an answer. I have read multiple times that <code>lower(column_name)</code> should work, but it does not.</p>  <p>Any help is appreciated. Thanks!</p>
