<p>I have the following models:</p>  <pre><code>class User   has_many :likes, dependent: :destroy   has_many :artists, through: :likes end  class Artist   has_many :likes, dependent: :destroy   has_many :users, through: :likes end  class Like   belongs_to :user   belongs_to :artist end </code></pre>  <p>I would like to delete User &lt;-> Artist associations (and <strong>not</strong> associated objects themselves), based on a given condition. I tried:</p>  <pre><code>user.artists.where(...).delete_all </code></pre>  <p>but artist objects have been removed as well, not only the associations.</p>  <p>If I don't supply a condition:</p>  <pre><code>user.artists.delete_all </code></pre>  <p>only the associations are removed, not the artist objects themselves.</p>  <p>So, how can I remove associations from a <code>has_many :through</code> relation, based on a condition?</p>
