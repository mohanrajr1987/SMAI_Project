<p>I am very new to C and have an assignment due soon. I need to write a program that asks the user for many numbers and stops when the user types "0". Then show the numbers the user typed and how many even and odd numbers there were. Then add them all up. I need my to have <code>num=0</code> for my function to work but thats also the number that stop the while statement so the program ends up not even asking for an input and just stops right away. Can anybody help me with this? Any clues or guidelines would be greatly appreciated.</p>  <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; #include &lt;string.h&gt;  int getNumbers(int sumEven, int sumOdd, int num);  int main (void) {  int number_of_integers, sumEven, sumOdd; char user_name[128];  printf("What is your name?\n"); scanf("%s", user_name);  printf("\nEnter any real numbers followed by ENTER.\n"); int num = 0;  while (num = 0) {     scanf("%d\n", &amp;num);     if (num &lt; 0)         printf("&lt;-Error: Please enter positive numbers!-&gt;\n"); }  num = getNumbers(sumEven, sumOdd, num);  printf("%s, the numbers you entered are broken down as follows:\n", user_name); printf("%d" , num);  return 0; }  int getNumbers(int sumEven, int sumOdd, int num)  {     sumEven = 0;     sumOdd = 0;      if (num % 2 == 0)         sumEven += num;     else         sumOdd += num; } </code></pre>
