<p>I've read tons of similar questions and haven't gotten anywhere.. </p>  <p>What I'm trying to do is connect to a printer directly by IP (not one that's in my windows devices list) and print a document to it. </p>  <p>Here's what I've tried so far (didn't work, no idea why):</p>  <pre><code>try{     Socket sock = new Socket("1.2.3.4", 9100);     PrintWriter oStream = new PrintWriter(sock.getOutputStream());         oStream.println("Hello World");         oStream.close();         sock.close();  } catch (UnknownHostException e){     e.printStackTrace(); }  catch (IOException e) {      e.printStackTrace(); } </code></pre>
