<p>I am building a single-page application (with Angular) that basically consists on a multi-step form which can be printed when finished.</p>  <p>Here you can see the look of a sample section of the print-view, with colors and different font-weights:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/jHVyv.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/jHVyv.png" alt="Completed form"></a></p>  <p>What happens is, when I click print (whether through the browser menu or through a button I provide with <code>javascript:if(window.print)window.print()</code>) the print document's font is all black and has only one weight.</p>  <p>Here's what it looks like:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/XWQ94.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/XWQ94.png" alt="Print document"></a></p>  <p>I tried re-styling it using <code>@media print</code> to no avail. I can change the font-size and the margins/padding for instance, but I am not able to change the color or font-weight of my text.</p>  <p>For instance:</p>  <pre><code>@media print {     html, body {         color: yellow;         font-size: 0.9em;     } } </code></pre>  <p>The above snippet does reduce my font-size but not the color.</p>  <p>Those thin, grey-ish borders you can see separating each item do appear in their original color however.</p>  <p>Why is this? How can I have this print document with the same font color and weight that I see on the browser?</p>  <p><strong>EDIT:</strong> There are no printer settings other than the very basic options we have in Chrome:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/JA9La.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/JA9La.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
