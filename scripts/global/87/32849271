<p>Today I encountered one weird bug in Chrome's printing behavior. When I try to print a dynamically created PDF using Chrome (<strong>also in Firefox</strong>), every image inside the PDF gets a little bit smaller (8mm). This doesn't happen neither in Adobe Reader/Acrobat/MacOSX Default Printer Dialog.</p>  <p>Let me explain more about my code so far:</p>  <h3>dynamic PDF:</h3>  <p>I use <code>prawn</code> to dynamically create  a PDF A4 (landscape format) using this code:</p>  <pre><code>require 'prawn' require "prawn/measurement_extensions"  class CustomPdf &lt; Prawn::Document    def initialize(label) # A4     super({        :page_size =&gt;  "A4",         :page_layout =&gt; :landscape,         :margin =&gt; 0,         :print_scaling =&gt; :none})      image "my_image.png", :width =&gt; 213.mm, :at =&gt; [3.mm, 3.mm]   end end </code></pre>  <h3>nested image inside the PDF:</h3>  <p>The Image nested inside the PDF has a size of <code>213mm x 70mm</code> with  <code>300 DPI</code>. In Pixel: 2515x827.</p>  <p>I create the Image using RMagick but the size, dpi and everything so far seems to be alright. So no further explanation at the moment.</p>  <h3>Expected result:</h3>  <p>The printed PDF will show an image with 213cm width.</p>  <h3>Actual result:</h3>  <p>The printed PDF will show an image with 205mm width.</p>  <h3>What I tried so far</h3>  <ul> <li>Setting the <code>prawn page_size</code> to something lower than A4 (since the Image isn't bigger as A4 as well...).</li> <li>Playing around with <code>print_scaling</code>(there are 3 modes, <code>:none</code>, <code>:AppDefault</code>, <code>:something_except_the_other_ones</code> <a href="https://github.com/prawnpdf/prawn/blob/master/manual/document_and_page_options/print_scaling.rb" rel="nofollow">(Read more about it here)</a></li> <li>Giving the image a fixed height (70mm)</li> <li>Playing around with various settings provided by the <code>Chrome Printer Dialog</code></li> </ul>  <p>Neither of these did anything. I looked through the Bugreporters of Chromium and found 2 people who might share the same problem as I do:</p>  <ul> <li><a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=97972" rel="nofollow">https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=97972</a></li> <li><a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=67091" rel="nofollow">https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=67091</a></li> </ul>  <p>The last one was touched 2013 but no one said anything that actually worked for my case.</p>  <p>If someone needs example PDF/300dpi Image I can upload one.</p>  <h3>What you need to reproduce</h3>  <ul> <li>ruby</li> <li>prawn.rb</li> <li>an image with 300dpi &amp; 2515x827px in the same folder as test_printer.rb</li> <li>the test code listed below:</li> </ul>  <p><strong>custom_pdf.rb</strong> code above.</p>  <p><strong>test_printer.rb</strong></p>  <pre><code>require 'prawn' require 'prawn/measurement_extensions'  open("output.pdf", "wb") do |f|   f.write CustomPdf.new(nil).render end puts "Done. Open with chrome -&gt; print -&gt; measure." </code></pre>  <p>Run <code>ruby test_printer.rb</code> to create the PDF (it's stored as output.pdf in current folder). Print the PDF 2 times (once with Chrome Printer Dialog &amp; once with the system one). </p>  <p><code>I will make a GitHub repository out of this if I have enough spare time.</code></p>  <p>Unfortunately I can't change the size of the image (not even a pixel). Someone experienced the same problem? Why isn't there a <strong>Use 100% Size</strong> in the Chrome Printer dialog? </p>  <p>Any ideas? It's an interesting puzzle I guess... :x</p>  <p>I will raise a 500 bounty on this asap.</p>
