<p>Is it possible - and if so, how? - to print from a Firefox OS phone?</p>  <p>Looking for a real mobile solution - e.g., printing out a receipt using mobile phone and a small receipt printer (connected probably through usb or wifi tethering) at a marketplace, on a train, etc. (The mobile will communicate through internet with a server, so it will have an internet connection.)</p>
