<p>I am receiving <strong>XML File</strong> for label now i wanted to print that label with my printer. what i am getting in the xml file is some strange string that found to be <strong>base64</strong> so i decoded it and now the problem raise that the decoded data itself found to be <strong>EPL</strong>(eltron Printer language). Now i want to convert that <strong>EPL to normal image</strong> file and print with my printer. what i get is raw program data. like</p>  <pre><code>N Q992,24 R40,0 S4 D15 I8,A,001 ZB A760,166,1,4,1,1,N,"dpd" ....AND SO ON.... </code></pre>  <p>now there are few more codes but i dont know how to convert this data to image or directly print with <strong>c#</strong> code.</p>
