<p>I'm trying to build a basic v4 printer driver in Visual Studio with WDK using this <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/dn641620(v=vs.85).aspx" rel="nofollow">link</a></p>  <p>I followed every step exactly, and everything worked out fine, until the last step when trying to build the solution, I get this error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Error 1   error : The driver processor architecture does not match the   processor architecture of the target computer.  The processor   architecture of the driver and the computer must match.   C:\Program   Files (x86)\Windows   Kits\8.1\build\Win32\ImportAfter\DriverDeployment.targets 69  9   TestPrinter   Package </p> </blockquote>  <p>I tried changing the platform to x64, still the same error. Any idea how to fix this error? Please note that I'm using Visual Studio 2013 and WDK 8.1 on x64 Win.</p>  <p><strong>Edit:</strong> I changed the platform again to x64(active) and it did fix the error. However, new errors appeared:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Error 9   error : Driver Deployment Task Failed: Driver Removal (x64)   (possible reboot) C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.1\build\x64\ImportAfter\DriverDeployment.targets  69  9   TestPrinter Package</p>      <p>Error 10  error : Driver Deployment Task Failed: Default Printer Driver Package Installation Task (possible reboot)   C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.1\build\x64\ImportAfter\DriverDeployment.targets  69  9   TestPrinter Package</p> </blockquote>  <p>Any Idea what are those errors? </p>
