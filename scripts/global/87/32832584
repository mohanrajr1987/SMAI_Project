<p>I need to come up with a form in SSRS 2008 that prints labels based on information stored in a table or tables. So far I have been unsuccessful in my online searching. How do I tell SSRS that I want the KitOrder.QuantityCommitted quantity of labels to print for each item? (each item has it's own quantity) I will likely be printing labels for 20-30 items at a time. In case it's helpful to know, there are 18 blank labels per sheet.</p>  <p>edited 10/01/15 Sorry, I played around with with the example you gave and wasn't able to get my report to work. I am not an expert with SSRS.  I have 2 tables I am using to get the info I need for the labels and only need the columns listed below the table names at this point.</p>  <pre><code>KitOrder        INNER JOIN      Item KitOrderNumber                ItemNumber Quantity                      ItemDescription </code></pre>  <p>I am using KitOrderNumber from a dropdown box - IN(@KitOrderNumber) - as my Parameter. The ItemNumber and ItemDescription print on the label. Would there be some custom code I could use that would return 3 labels when KitOrder.Quantity = 3 instead of just 1 label?</p>
