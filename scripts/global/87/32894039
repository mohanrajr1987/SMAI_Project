<p>I have an HTML file that displays data with an image overlay form. </p>  <p>The image is called in the HTML using the following:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;IMG class=img-print-class src="\\servername\blah\blah\blah\*.PNG"&gt; &lt;IMG class=img-view-class src="\\servername\blah\blah\blah\*.PNG"&gt; </code></pre>  <p>All users can display the document correctly. But, for certain users, the image overlay does not print, only the data.  </p>  <p>There seems to be something tied to the user login profile that is impacting whether or not the overlay prints.  It is not a security access issue, because the affected users are able to navigate to the server that stores the image and right-click print it.  So, they have the security rights required to access the image.</p>  <p>Is there something in the windows profile that would affect this?  Any ideas?</p>
