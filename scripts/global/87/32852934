<p>I am currently developing an a Windows Form application that will print to a Zebra Printer. Using a barcode scanner for input, the application receives a unique identifier and then pings our database to gather information pertaining to the identifier. </p>  <p>The current set-up includes a barcode scanner connected via USB to a PC. A Zebra ZT410 Printer on the network via wired connection. PC on the network via wireless connection. </p>  <p>The PC is running the Windows Form Application. When a barcode is scanned, the application queries a database, returns pertinent information, and then sends ZPL to the printer containing the information to be printed. It works perfectly.</p>  <p>The current hurdle we are trying to overcome is completing this process without the need for a PC intermediary. The scanner plugs directly into the printer but I'm unaware of how to read scans from the scanner through the printer and ultimately over the network and into the application. Is this possible? If so, how might I go about it?</p>  <p>(I didn't include any code because I didn't believe it was needed but I can provide what I have if necessary).</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
