<p>I have written a program to send raw (text only) data to the printer so that the Dot Matrix Printer will have to print the provided texts only instead of interpreting the input as image(which makes huge time to finish). Dot Matrix Printer is installed as the Generic Text Printer in my control panel.</p>  <p>Printer - <strong>Wep 800 DX</strong>  <a href="http://www.wepindia.com/Support/Support.aspx?ItemCode=MFD-0380" rel="nofollow">http://www.wepindia.com/Support/Support.aspx?ItemCode=MFD-0380</a></p>  <pre><code>PrintService service = //My Dot Matrix Print Service String input = "ESC E BOLD ESC F PRINTING\n"; InputStream stream = new ByteArrayInputStream((input.getBytes(Charset.defaultCharset())); Doc doc = new SimpleDoc(stream, DocFlavor.INPUT_STREAM.AUTOSENSE, null); DocPrintJob job = service.createPrintJob(); try {     job.print(doc, null); } catch (PrintException e) {     e.printStackTrace(); }  // Codes // ESC E - Turn Bold printing on // ESC F - Turn Bold printing off </code></pre>  <p>I get the list of codes from</p>  <p><a href="http://www.lprng.com/DISTRIB/RESOURCES/PPD/epson.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lprng.com/DISTRIB/RESOURCES/PPD/epson.htm</a></p>  <p><a href="http://webpages.charter.net/dperr/links/esc_p83.htm" rel="nofollow">http://webpages.charter.net/dperr/links/esc_p83.htm</a></p>  <p>The reason why I get the codes from epson is because somewhere I read these are implemented by most of other manufacturers and also I cant seem to find any Printer manual for my printer in manufacturer's website.</p>  <p>But when I run this program, the command codes <code>ESC E</code> and <code>ESC F</code> were printed in the paper instead of interpreting it as command codes.</p>  <p>Maybe I'm sending the command codes in wrong format. Any help would be appreciated.</p>  <p><strong>Update</strong> - Got it working, Thanks @user2357112</p>  <pre><code>char[] bold    = {0x001B, 0x0045};    // ESC, E char[] unbold  = {0x001B, 0x0046};    // ESC, F String input = new String(bold) + " BOLD " + new String(unbold) + " PRINTING\n"; </code></pre>  <p>output - <strong>BOLD</strong> PRINTING</p>
