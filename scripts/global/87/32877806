<p>I am having some minor trouble with erlang, namely that I want to print out a given part of an array, however, I do not appear to be able to do so easily.</p>  <p>Here is the array I am trying to print using <code>array:get(X, Array)</code>.</p>  <pre><code>[{carrier, [{e,10}, {f,10}, {g,10}, {h,10}, {i,10}]},  {battleship, [{a,1}, {a,2}, {a,3}, {a,4}]},  {cruiser, [{e,3}, {e,4}, {e,5}]},  {destroyer, [{f,4},{g,4}, {h,4}]},  {patrol_boat, [{j,7},{j,8}]}] </code></pre>  <p>I am able to print out the entire array however, I am unable to get just a single tuple out of it.</p>  <p>Ideally I would be able to do <code>element(1, array:get(0, Array)).</code> with the return of <code>carrier</code>.</p>  <p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
