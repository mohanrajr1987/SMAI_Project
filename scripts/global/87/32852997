<p>I am simply looking for a way to change the font type of a printer in CUPS.</p>  <p>I have tried updating fonts, changing PPD's, changing font directories, and updating charset files.</p>  <p>The only partial solution I found was to change the charset file to contain the font type I wanted.</p>  <p>However, this changes the font type throughout CUPS and on all printers.</p>  <p>Does anyone know how to change one printer to print with a certain font and another printer to print with a different font?</p>  <p>NOTE: I am using CUPS on a RHEL box and cups4j to spawn the job through java.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
