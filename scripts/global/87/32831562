<p>I am using the following page as a helper:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.tharo.com/documents/tech582.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.tharo.com/documents/tech582.htm</a></p>  <p>On that page the EPC is broken down into the bits that need to be passed to the printer in ZPL. Based off that I have used the following ZPL and sent it to the printer:</p>  <pre><code>^XA ^RB96,8,3,3,20,24,38^FS ^RFW,E^FD48,3,5,0614141,100041,1^FS ^XZ </code></pre>  <p>Unfortunately I do not get the same EPC written to the tag as outlined in the document.</p>  <p><strong>Update</strong>: I am using the Zebra iOS SDK to encode the tags. In their documentation the ZPL is all in one line. </p>
