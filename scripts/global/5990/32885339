<p>I am trying to implement a Predictive modelling technique which requires a lot of the techniques included in the mclust R package. The model executes perfectly in R. How do I implement the same in Java. Is their a package in Java which implements the same. I don't want to take results from R and use it in java, as it takes a lot of time for large datasets. From where should I start?</p>
