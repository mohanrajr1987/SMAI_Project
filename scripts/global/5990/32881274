<p>Our machine learning model produces model of size ~250MB.</p>  <p>Is it good practice to store it in version control ?</p>  <p>I am thinking to store in HDFS and do offsite backup too in NAS. </p>  <p>I also tried to package it as RPM and then deploy RPM on HDFS. But time taken to create rpm , push to nexus is bit issue.</p>  <p>What are best practices around this ?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
