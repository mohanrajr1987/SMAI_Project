<p>Is there a framework/lib/platform for image recognition, much like how we have Elasticsearch for search?</p>  <p>In my imagination, this proposed lib would take my uploaded image, process it, then spit out a string of what it thinks the image is of.</p>  <p>I make the ES comparison because of how it offers immense power and control in implementing your search solution via a very simple and understandable API.</p>  <p>I'm looking to apply this within specific domains of images, say, something like identifying makes and models of cars.</p>  <p>Open-source / commercial use licensed would be great.</p>  <p>Also, would be great if I could interact with the lib using Python/Javascript, since I'm familiar with those, but if not, whatever, it's just syntax, I can learn a new language.</p>  <p>I understand I'm asking a lot, and if there isn't such a thing right now, perhaps the next closest solution, or an alternative approach might have to work. I would appreciate suggestions for those too. Thanks!</p>
