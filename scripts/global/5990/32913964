<p>How do we generally determine whether a given variable( feature) in a dataset is important or not for accurately doing the prediction task ?</p>  <p>What all tests should be conducted and used to determine suitability of a variable in prediction ?</p>  <p>Suppose I have 32 features and one of them is 'income', then how should I start analysing its importance. Is there any use in comparing this feature with other features, because in the end its the collection of variables that will help in prediction not these two variables which are compared ...</p>
