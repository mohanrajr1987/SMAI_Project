<p>I'm attempting to create my first model and playing around with different algorithms. I can hardly interpret things at this point so I'm just trying to get results and then copying and pasting different techinques. As a result, I did this:</p>  <pre><code>ab = ensemble.AdaBoostClassifier(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=1)  for i in range(20):     x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = cv.train_test_split(xc_train, yc_train,test_size=.6,random_state=i)     ab.fit(x_train, y_train)           results = rf.predict(x_test)     actual = y_test          print pd.crosstab(actual, results, rownames=['actual'], colnames=['preds']) </code></pre>  <p>My crosstab results showed AdaBoost much better at accurately predicting the rare event than my random forest. But after looking at my code I noticed an error:</p>  <pre><code>results = rf.predict(x_test) </code></pre>  <p>I'm guessing the code worked because I previously defined my Random Forest classifier as rf, but I have no idea what it means to use it inside of my AdaBoost function. What is going on?</p>
