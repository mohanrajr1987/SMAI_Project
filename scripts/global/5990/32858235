<p>i am a student and now i am doing research about text classification. i have read several paper about that. but i just found so many people using naive bayesian classifier.</p>  <pre><code>i have 4 class to classify. and i read that SVM can only classify thing into 2 class,..yes/no 1/0 </code></pre>  <p>is there any algorithm besides NBC algorithm for building classifiers to separate data into <em>more than</em> two classes?</p>
