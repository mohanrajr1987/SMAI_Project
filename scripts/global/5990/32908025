<p>I've been using caffe for a while, with some success, but I have noticed in examples given that there is only ever a two way split on the data set with <code>TRAIN</code> and <code>TEST</code> phases, where the <code>TEST</code> set seems to act as a validation set.</p>  <p>Ideally I would like to have three sets, so that once the model is trained, I can save it and test it on a completely new test set - stored in a completed separate lmdb folder. Does anyone have any experience of this? Thanks.</p>
