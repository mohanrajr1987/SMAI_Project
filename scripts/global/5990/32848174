<p>In <code>matlab</code> I have this function</p>  <pre><code> function psi = encodeImage(encoder, im) </code></pre>  <p>This function takes</p>  <ul> <li><p><code>im</code> which is list of names of images</p></li> <li><p><code>encoder</code> which is <code>bovw.mat</code> I have this file as encoder</p></li> </ul>  <p>This function does bag of visual words encoding and returns the spatial histograms of images.</p>  <p>I use this histograms for training in SVM classifier.</p>  <p>I am doing this task in python and I don't want to implement the bag of visual words encoding as my main task is to implement SVM. Is there a built in function in python that does bag of visual words encoding and returns spatial histograms so I can train SVM classifier on histograms. </p>
