<p>I am building a prediction model in which I have a temperature feature  that I am scaling using min-max. All is good, however during prediction when calling my model, I have only one row for which I need to predict and therefore only one value for temperature feature which make it impossible to scale for minmax</p>  <p>How can I scale using minmax my temperature input feature on prediction time when I have only a datum  .</p>  <p>If this is not possible, what scaling/normalization method can I use to scale my temperature feature between [0,1] that would work on a vector of n elements or 1 element only</p>
