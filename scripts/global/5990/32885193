<p>I have good programming experience. Now I want to deep dive into NLP and ML. To start with I am ok to use whatever open source tools(NLTK etc) and API's are out there that could get me off the ground instead of reinventing the wheel.</p>  <p>To achieve the above, I'd like to learn as I am building something. A domain(real estate) specific speech driven chat bot that could actually learn over a period of time (with my programming/training assistance) and help people find a house of their choice (based on preferences like rent, area, amenities etc). I have a lot of data points that could be used to train such a system (virtual broker).</p>  <p>I tried doing some very high level steps-by-step procedure to follow :</p>  <ol> <li><p>Speech to Text </p></li> <li><p>Making sense out of this text (NLP) + Keep learning (ML)</p></li> <li><p>Triggering an intent/code based on what question was asked</p></li> <li><p>Go fetch and process the data</p></li> <li><p>Respond (Text to Speech)</p></li> </ol>  <p>Point 2 is MY BIGGEST UNKNOWN. I need your help to break it down to simpler steps that I can follow to achieve what I am trying to i.e. what will it actually take to build that piece of intelligence that can take a lot of different questions meaning the same thing and can output to a single known question.</p>  <p>As I said, some concrete actionable items that will be my road map from 0 to project completion. </p>
