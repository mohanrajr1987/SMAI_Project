<p>I have defined a regressor as follows:</p>  <pre><code>nn1 = Regressor( layers=[     Layer("Rectifier", units=150),     Layer("Rectifier", units=100),     Layer("Linear")], regularize="L2", # dropout_rate=0.25, learning_rate=0.01, valid_size=0.1, learning_rule="adagrad", verbose=False, weight_decay=0.00030, n_stable=10, f_stable=0.00010, n_iter=200) </code></pre>  <p>I am using this regressor in a k-fold cross-validation. In order for cross-validation to work properly and not learn from the previous folds, it's necessary that the regressor to be reset after each fold.<br> How can I reset the regressor object?</p>
