<p>In Neural Networks, the number of samples used for training data is 5000 and before the data is given for training it was normalized using the formula</p>  <pre><code>     y - mean(y) y' = -----------       stdev(y) </code></pre>  <p>Now I want to de-normalise the data after getting the predicted output. Generally for prediction a test data data is used which is 2000 samples. In order to de-normalize, following formula is used</p>  <pre><code>y = y' * stdev(y) + mean(y) </code></pre>  <p>This approach is taken from the following thread [<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32320090/how-to-denormalise-de-standardise-neural-net-predictions-after-normalising-inp][1]">How to denormalise (de-standardise) neural net predictions after normalising input data</a></p>  <p>Could anyone explain me how the same mean and standard deviation used in normalizing the training data(5000*2100) could be used in de-normalizing the predicted data as you know for prediction test data(2000*2100)  is used,both the counts are different.</p>
