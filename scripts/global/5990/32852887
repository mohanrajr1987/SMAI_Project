<p>I need to create application in Python, which takes big amounts of unsorted data, then cleans it, select features, process them, etc. The main question is what tools to use. Which license to use? The application must be executing on local machines because the data is confidential, it must not be taken and processed by non-local machines. I wanted to use Apache Spark, but what about that requirements?</p>  <p>My thoughts: Apache Spark and modules SciPy, NumPy, Scikit-Learn.</p>
