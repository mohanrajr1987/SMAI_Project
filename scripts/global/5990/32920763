<p>Suppose I have the dataset in the following format:</p>  <pre><code>col1    col2     col3      col4         col5 (to be predicted) 12      13       4         primary      12  1       15       2         secondary    13 5       7        8         primary      18 14      12       44        college      6 </code></pre>  <p>col5 needs to be predicted for some test data using col1, col2, col3 and col4</p>  <p>During training, col1, col2, col3 can be feeded as such in an array to the classifier but how to feed col4. I am aware that this is categorical and need to be converted to numeric type, but even after assigning some number, it will still remain as nominal type. </p>  <p>So if primary=1, secondary=2 and college=3, the numbers 1,2 and 3 cant be compared as per their magnitude because they are still like labels, with no numerical significance.</p>  <p>So how should I proceed after this step... should they be normalized ? or any further should be done ?</p>
