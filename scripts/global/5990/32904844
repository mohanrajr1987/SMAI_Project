<p>I'm an experienced Java developer, and have a background on math and statistics as a university student, but never really used them after graduation. In my current position we are considering doing projects that could benefit from ML, like recommendation systems, etc. </p>  <p>I've tried going directly to a library like Apache Mahout, but I feel I'm missing the big picture. On the other hand I've tried to do an ML course on Coursera but it was full of math and didn't feel any practical.</p>  <p>What would be a good learning path for someone in my position to start working with ML? </p>  <p>I'm open to any suggestions, like:</p>  <ul> <li>Books, </li> <li>Online courses, </li> <li>Video training, </li> <li>Training seminars, </li> <li>etc.</li> </ul>
