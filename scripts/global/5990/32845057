<p>Can someone please help me clarify.</p>  <p>I am currently using collaborative filtering (ALS) which returns a recommendation list with scores corresponding to the recommended items. In addition to this, I am boosting the scores (+0.1) if the items contain a tag that corresponds with what the user has specified they prefer such as "romantic movies". To me, this is considered a hybrid collaborative approach since it's boosting the Collaborative filtering results with content-based filtering (Please correct me if I am wrong). </p>  <p>Now, what if I did the same approach without doing Collaborative filtering? would it be considered Content-based Filtering? since I will be still recommending dishes based on the content and attributes of each dish corresponding to what the user has specified they like (such as "romantic movies"). </p>  <p>The reason why I'm confused is because I've seen content-based filtering where they apply an algorithm such as Naive Bayes etc, and this approach would be similar to a simple search of the items (on the contents). </p>
