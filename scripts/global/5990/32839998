<p>I want to know that why don't we directly use the square loss in case of binary classification.what are the disadvantages.also I want to know the domain ,range , formula and shape of loss function for a multi-class classification , also i want to know that whether this is a convex and continuous function,and if not than please also let me know that how shall I find its surrogate or where I can read about finding the sub-gradient of the loss function in case it is discontinuous like hinge loss.</p>
