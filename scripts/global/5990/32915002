<p>I have a dataset with unknown number of clusters and I aim to cluster them. Since, I don't know the number of clusters in advance, I tried to use density-based algorithms especially DBSCAN. The problem that I have with DBSCAN is that how to detect appropriate epsilon. The method suggested in the DBSCAN paper assume there are some noises and when we plot sorted k-dist graph we can detect valley and define the threshold for epsilon. But, my dataset obtained from a controlled environment and there are no noise. </p>  <p>Does anybody have an idea of how to detect epsilon? Or, suggest better clustering algorithm could fit this problem.</p>
