<p>Pls. tell me how to do recommendation on imbalanced dataset of Recommender Systems. As per my knowledge one need to create training and testing files for each user, having their ratings as the class label. For Ex: Suppose user have given <code>Item1</code>, <code>Item4</code> and <code>Item3</code> <code>rating 5</code>, 5 and 1 respectively and we want to predict his rating for <code>Item6</code> For a <code>user1</code> the training data will be:</p>  <pre><code>User1_F1,User1_F2,......................Item1_F1,Item1_F2....,5 User1_F1,User1_F2,......................Item4_F1,Item4_F2....,5 User1_F1,User1_F2,......................Item3_F1,Item3_F2....,1 </code></pre>  <p>// <code>User1_F1</code> (shows the feature of <code>user1</code>) &amp; <code>Item3_F1</code> (shows the feature of <code>item3</code>) and so on...</p>  <p>testing data will be: <code>User1_F1</code>,<code>User1_F2</code>,......................<code>Item6_F1</code>,<code>Item6_F2</code>....,? Please correct me if i am wrong.... Here,as we can see class <code>label1</code> comes only one time but <code>class5</code> comes two times, how to remove this imbalanced dataset problem? And also tell me how to handle imbalanced data or any tool that can do pre-processing before applying recommendation on this data? </p>
