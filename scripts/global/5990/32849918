<p>My doubt is conceptual and is as follows :-</p>  <ol> <li>I train a SVM classifier using fitcsvm function.</li> <li>I then test the classifier using a separate test data. I get the SVM scores as the output.</li> <li>I also use perfcurve and that gives me the operating point of the classifier and then I compute the score threshold, for the operating point.</li> <li>The SVM scores obtained in step 2: is a matrix of two columns.</li> </ol>  <p>I then want to determine the classification results at the threshold corresponding to the operating point of the classifier. </p>  <p>How do I do this ? </p>  <p>a) Which column of the scores matrix be used to do thresholding ? b) Are the signs of the scores to be taken into account when doing thresholding ?</p>  <p>Here are the following lines which might give a context to what I am facing :</p>  <pre><code>&gt;&gt; [spec,sens,thresh,AUC,OPT,~,~] = perfcurve(test_label,test_score(:,2),1);  &gt;&gt; OPT  ans =      0.1944    0.9181  &gt;&gt; threshold_operating_point = thresh((spec==opt(1))&amp;(Y==opt(2)));  threshold_operating_point =      0.6884  This is the classifier threshold for the operating point. I want to compute the classification results for this operating point.   &gt;&gt; [~,test_score] = predict(model_trained,train_feat);  &gt;&gt; test_score   &gt;&gt; test_score =   -1.00022448638507   1.00022448638507 -0.999807139595139  0.999807139595139 -1.00021846153188   1.00021846153188 -1.00022337382631   1.00022337382631 -1.00018760991968   1.00018760991968 -1.00023087489260   1.00023087489260 0.311552801717325   -0.311552801717325 0.311552211659033   -0.311552211659033 0.311552038402263   -0.311552038402263 0.311552212406740   -0.311552212406740 </code></pre>  <p>As you can see, it has two columns. Which column do I use to threshold the scores ? Also, how are the signs of scores important ? I basically want to use the threshold for the operating point and precisely pinpoint, which are the true positives, false positives, true negatives and false negatives.</p>
