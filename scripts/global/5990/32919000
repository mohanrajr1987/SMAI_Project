<p>Upto what extent we should fill the missing values for a feature in a dataset so that it doesnt become redundant ?</p>  <p>I have a dataset which has a max of 42000 observations. There are three features which have around 20000, 35000 and 7000 values missing. Should I still use them by filling these missing values or dump these three features? </p>  <p>How do we decide the threshold for keeping or dumping a feature given the number of missing values of that feature ?</p>
