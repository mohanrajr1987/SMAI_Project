<p>I'm looking for an easy and best practice solution to add the string <code>:</code> after 2 characters in my string. </p>  <p>My string looks like this: <code>1100</code>. Now I would like to have the result: <code>11:00</code>.</p>  <p>I've found only many solutions to add <code>:</code> after <strong>2</strong> characters, but they also will add <code>:</code> after 00 because the solution is to add : after every 2 characters.</p>  <p>That's not what I want, I need only one addition of : after 2 characters.</p>  <p>Can you help me?</p>
