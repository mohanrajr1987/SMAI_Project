<p>Hey i was coding in VBA and i noticed something very strange. When i am trying to declare a char variable the Visual Basic does not recognize the Char type. The closest match in hints to char is characters.  I was searching through some forums and guides but i found nothing</p>  <p>I would send some images but i don't have those 10 points :/</p>  <p>Anybody similar with this ? Is there any way to fix this ?</p>  <p>By the way , posting something here is nearly impossible because of that red window popping up all the time -.-</p>
