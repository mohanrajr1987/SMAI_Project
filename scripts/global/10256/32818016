<p>So I have a program that counts the number of occurrences of each letter in a string, and for that I use</p>  <pre><code>int[] charAmount = new int[30];     for(int i = 0; i&lt;text.length(); i++){             char sign = text.charAt(i);             int value = sign;             if(value &gt;= 97 &amp;&amp; value &lt;= 122){                 charAmount[value-97]++;  // 97 = 'a'             } </code></pre>  <p>This works fine, but I also need to cover the letters 'æ' (230), 'ø' (248) &amp; 'å' (229). How can I "assign" those three letters to the 26, 27 &amp; 29th index of the charAmount array without using if tests or a switch?</p>  <p>EDIT: The code presented above is not the whole block, I also have a switch for the letters in question, but I am looking for a better solution.  </p>  <p><strong>BONUS PROBLEM: When I try to enter a string like "æææ" or something, the value of 'æ' is suddenly 8216. I use a Scanner to read the input.</strong></p>
