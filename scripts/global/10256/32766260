<p>I want to manipulate large files, above 1GB, the easier way possible (without installing anything). I found out FART (Find and Replace Text), which works great, but I have a problem which I couldn't find the answer.</p>  <p>My file looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>-- Test -- -- Another -- </code></pre>  <p>I which to transform it like this:</p>  <pre><code>## Test ## ## Another -- </code></pre>  <p>I which to replace \n-- for \n## But -- is interpreted as a command, and not as the char I which to replace.</p>  <p>I tried using escaping, but maybe I'm doing it wrong. Would someone help me out?</p>  <p>I which to do something like:</p>  <pre><code>fart.exe -c -i -p -C big_file.txt "\n--" "\n##" </code></pre>  <p>This works parcially:</p>  <pre><code>fart.exe -c -i -p -C big_file.txt "\--" "##" </code></pre>  <p>But I need the \n in front.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
