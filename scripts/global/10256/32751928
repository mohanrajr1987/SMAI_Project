<p>I am developing a Hangman game for an Uni assessment in C++ and I am having trouble displaying my hidden words after the user types a letter. So I have got the word being displayed as '_ _ _ _ _ _ _' but when I type a letter it doesn't swap the underscore for the actual  letter.</p>  <pre><code>game::game() {  words[0] = "strongly"; words[1] = "cheese"; words[2] = "computer"; words[3] = "coffee"; words[4] = "potatoes";         //words that can be in the game words[5] = "zebra"; words[6] = "extinguisher"; words[7] = "solution"; words[8] = "diligent"; words[9] = "flabbergasted";  numGuesses = 0;  hiddenWord = words[rand() % 10]; //pick a random word from array words  completedWord = hiddenWord;  //for loop for changing the word to underscores for (int i = 0; i &lt; completedWord.length(); i++) {     completedWord[i] = '_';  }     //for loop adding a space after underscore for (int i = 0; i &lt; completedWord.length(); i++) {     cout &lt;&lt; completedWord[i] &lt;&lt; " ";   }  cout &lt;&lt; endl; cout &lt;&lt; "Please enter a letter: ";   char guessedLetter; cin &gt;&gt; guessedLetter;  if (guessedLetter = completedWord[0]) {     completedWord = guessedLetter;     //cout &lt;&lt; guessedLetter &lt;&lt; endl;     cout &lt;&lt; completedWord &lt;&lt; endl;   }   } </code></pre>  <p>My whole program is separated into different header files and cpp files. So the code above is from my gameguesses.cpp and the header for that is below:</p>  <pre><code>    class game { public:     string words[10];     game();     string hiddenWord;     int numGuesses;      string completedWord;  }; </code></pre>  <p>And this is what I actually get:  <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/FOaK8.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/FOaK8.png" alt="My code problem"></a></p>  <p>A help would be appreciated. Thank you!</p>
