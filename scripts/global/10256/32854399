<p>I am trying to make a program that uses three digit numbers to identify items and I am trying to use something like the charAt method for integers or something. Im not too sure. Im a beginner and I apologize i just need help. Also I need a bit of help to use an if statement and relational operators. Im trying to do if the last digit in the number is less than 5 then it is {item} and if its greater than 5 then its this {item}. Something like that. Thank you so much in advance.</p>  <pre><code>    String number;      System.out.println("Enter three digit number: ");     number = in.nextLine();      switch (number.charAt(0))     {          //stuff     }      if (number &gt; 5)     {       //it is this item     {     else     {       //it is the other item     { </code></pre>
