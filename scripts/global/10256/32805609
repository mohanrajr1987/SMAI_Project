<pre><code>string line = "testtesttest"; string whole = line[i];  </code></pre>  <p>Why doesn't this code work? I need to do this conversion so I can use strcmp so I can compare the string element to an array of chars    </p>  <pre><code>char symbols[3][3] = {'--', '*-', '-*'}; </code></pre>  <p>I was trying to do this</p>  <pre><code>if (strcmp(line[i],symbols[j]) == 1) </code></pre>  <p>but apparently line[i] doesn't count as a string, so I think converting line[i] to a string somehow would be the best course of action. I have tried multiple other conversions to find a way to compare an element of a string[i] to each char 'symbol' but nothing is working for me. I have tried strcpy and a bunch more things and I am getting frustrated, any help is appreciated. </p>
