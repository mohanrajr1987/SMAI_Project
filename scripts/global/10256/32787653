<p>Question: In C++, ow do I make a program throw out an error when a user enters multiple characters for an input requesting a single character? I'd like to have the program re-prompt for a single character, but it just keeps going and entering the multiple characters on later lines. </p>  <p>This is a very simple program I wrote to test out character inputs and their properties to help me with another assignment. I wanted to see how it would react to multi-character inputs. </p>  <pre><code>//Include statements #include &lt;iostream&gt; #include &lt;string&gt;  using namespace std;  //main statement  int main () {      //name variables     int numChar;     char letterEntry;     string finalWord = "";      //begin entry      cout &lt;&lt; "This program will let you enter characters and combine them into a string." &lt;&lt; endl;     cout &lt;&lt; "First tell us how many characters you want to enter." &lt;&lt; endl;     cin &gt;&gt; numChar;      //convert characters to string and add to string variable     int counter = 0;     while (counter&lt;numChar)     {         cout &lt;&lt; "Enter a character!" &lt;&lt; endl;         cin &gt;&gt; letterEntry;          finalWord = finalWord + string(1, letterEntry);         counter++;     }     //Display final word     cout &lt;&lt; "Your word is " &lt;&lt; finalWord &lt;&lt; endl;      return(0); } </code></pre>  <p>This is an output that demonstrates my issue.</p>  <pre><code>This program will let you enter characters and combine them into a string. First tell us how many characters you want to enter. 3 Enter a character! DOGS Enter a character! Enter a character! Your word is DOG </code></pre>  <p>I want the program to not save anything if the user types in more than one character. I want it to print an error message that says "You entered more than one character, please retry," and lets them try again. Is there a way to do this with type char?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
