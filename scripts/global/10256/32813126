<p>I am trying to write program, which take text and seperate it into sentences.<br> Input: </p>  <pre><code>Hi, my name is John. </code></pre>  <p>Output:</p>  <pre><code>Hi,  my  name  is  John. </code></pre>  <p>Code</p>  <pre><code>int main () {   int str[200];    int i = 0;   puts ("Enter text. Do not forget to put dot at the end.");   do {     str[i] = getchar();     i++;   } while (str[i-1] != '.');    printf("\n");   int k, lenght = 0; //lenght -- the lenght of single word    for (i=0; str[i] != '.'; i++) {     if (str[i] == ' ' || str[i] == '.') {     printf ("\n");     k = i - lenght;      do {         putchar (str[k]);         k++;     } while (str[k] != ' ');     lenght = 0;     }      lenght++;   }    printf ("\n stop");   return 0; } </code></pre>  <p>If you try to run or if you can see, there is an error. It does not output last word.</p>  <p>I tried to put there this cycle:</p>  <pre><code>  do  {     if (str[i] == ' ') {     printf("\n");     k=i-lenght;     do {         putchar(str[k]);         k++;      }while(str[k] != ' ');      lenght=0;      }      lenght++;     i++;   }while(str[i+1] != '.'); </code></pre>  <p>But its the same cycle... I also tried to make function:</p>  <pre><code>void word (char *c,int index, int lenght ) {    printf ("\n");    int i = index - lenght;     do {         putchar (c[i]);         i++;     } while (c[i] != ' ');     return; } </code></pre>  <p>and I called it instead of do-while cycle (in the "if section " of the code):</p>  <pre><code>for (i=0; str[i] != '.'; i++) {     if (str[i] == ' ' || str[i] == '.') {     word(str, i, lenght);     lenght = 0;     }      lenght++;   } </code></pre>  <p>What surpriced me was, that the function was "outputting" only the firs Word in sentence. If the first word was "John" it output "John" "ohn" "hn".</p>  <p>So there is not just one question...</p>  <p><strong>How to remake/repaire the cycle/function to output what I want - all of the words in the sentence?</strong></p>  <p><strong>Why it does not work?</strong> Well I know the answer - beacouse thy cycle is built to end on character ' ', but not the '.', but when I tried to change it, it output one more random character after dot.</p>  <p>Just please dont blame me for the code, I am just begginer trying to learn something. I know its not a Masterpiece and I can and I will make it shorter before I finish it.</p>
