<p>I'm trying to convert an int (4bytes) and add it into an array of chars. I do the converting from int to char using this code I found from stackoverflow.</p>  <pre><code>unsigned char buffer[4]; buffer[0] = (value &gt;&gt; 24) &amp; 0xFF; buffer[1] = (value &gt;&gt; 16) &amp; 0xFF; buffer[2] = (value &gt;&gt; 8) &amp; 0xFF; buffer[3] = value &amp; 0xFF; </code></pre>  <p>where value is the int value that I want to convert. It works perfectly fine, for example, if I were to convert the value 100 using the code above, it will give the following: '\0', '\0', '\0', 'd'</p>  <p>And I'm trying to add this into an array of char I have (its added at an index i, not at index 0), but since the 1st character is null, my array of char (cstring) gets cut off from there. So I can only see the strings uptil index i - 1, and since null comes at index i, my cstring ends there. I was wondering if anyone knows a way to overcome this situation. Any help would be appreciated!</p>
