<p>It is definitely possible that <code>cstdint</code> typedefs bind to char variables. For example, it is very likely that <code>uint_least8_t</code> binds to <code>unsigned char</code>, and <code>int_least8_t</code> binds to <code>char</code>.</p>  <p>Does the Standard guarantee that similar thing won't happen to <code>size_t</code> or similar types? Or is there at least a purely theoretical chance that such types will bind to some char types, like <code>unsigned char</code> or maybe even <code>wchar_t</code>?</p>
