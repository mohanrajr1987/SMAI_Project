<p>I´m trying to make some text mining on pdf files with PHP. For some cases converting it to TXT with pdftotext Works well but on some PDF´s I will need to take a text between to BOLD phrases.</p>  <p>Example: <strong>This is a title</strong> This is the text 1</p>  <p><strong>This is another title</strong> This is the text 2</p>  <p>and goes on. </p>  <p>Is there any way to take this "raw" pdf information with PHP?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
