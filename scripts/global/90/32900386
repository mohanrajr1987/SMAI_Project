<p>I want to have a scatter plot in a PDF presentation:</p>  <p>For example I want to plot distance vs. time, where I measured the distance every 2 seconds.  And suppose I have 3 different cars that I'm measuring (A/B/C) and I also measured them all at 3 different temperatures (10/0/-10).</p>  <p>So in total I have 9 sets of points.</p>  <p>What I would like is to be able to allow my audience (who'll also have a copy of the PDF) only show 10 degree data or only show 0 degree data as displaying all 9 data sets becomes messy.</p>  <p>I tried to see if this was possible for excel charts in powerpoint then export to PDF, but haven't been able to get it working.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
