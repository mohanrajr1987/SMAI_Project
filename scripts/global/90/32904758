<p>Using iMacros, I go to several websites with a search box (e.g. Google) and fill in these boxes with variables 'A','B' from a .csv file and search. Next, I would like to print the page that shows using a virtual pdf-printer (to get a pdf file). However, I can't get the pdf-printer to automatically rename the file (in a specific format, i.e. 'A' 'B' website.pdf) and save it to a specific location. </p>  <p>Current Code:</p>  <pre><code>SET !DATASOURCE C:\Users\Batchtest.csv SET !LOOP 2 SET !DATASOURCE_LINE {{!LOOP}} TAB CLOSEALLOTHERS TAB T=1 URL GOTO=https://www.google.com TAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:TEXT CONTENT={{!COL1}}&lt;SP&gt;{{!COL2}} WAIT SECONDS=2 ONPRINT P= WAIT SECONDS=1 PRINT WAIT SECONDS=1 </code></pre>  <p>How would I tackle this problem? The ONDOWNLOAD command and similar commands don not seem to work - does the pdf-printing process take place <em>outside</em> the browser?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
