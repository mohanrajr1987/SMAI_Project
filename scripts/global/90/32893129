<p>I'm working in C# with <a href="http://www.e-iceblue.com/Introduce/free-pdf-component.html#.Vg1ncSuA9-I" rel="nofollow">Spire.PDF</a>. Specifically, my goal is to load binary PDF data from a database into a <code>Spire.Pdf.PdfDocument</code> object.</p>  <p>According to this <a href="http://www.e-iceblue.com/Tutorials/Spire.PDF/Spire.PDF-Program-Guide/Document-Operation/Save-PDF-file-to-Stream-and-Load-PDF-file-from-Stream-in-C-.NET.html" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>, I should be able to use the <code>LoadFromStream()</code> method or some unspecified method that takes a byte array (see bottom of page at link where there is a link but only to the general documentation). However, this method seems absent from the current NuGet package.</p>  <p>So, in summary, how can I make a <code>Spire.Pdf.PdfDocument</code> object using a byte array of data? Thanks in advance.</p>  <p>Please comment if you know a better .NET library for converting PDFs to and from images.</p>
