<p>I have a program written in my python using the PyPDF2 package to scrape a batch of pdf files. These PDF's aren't in the greatest shape so in order for my program to run, I need to modify the pdf.py file located within the package library as recommended by this website: </p>  <p><a href="https://cheonhyangzhang.wordpress.com/2015/03/31/python-pdffilereader-pdfreaderror-eof-marker-not-found/" rel="nofollow">https://cheonhyangzhang.wordpress.com/2015/03/31/python-pdffilereader-pdfreaderror-eof-marker-not-found/</a></p>  <p>Is there a way I can implement this change to the file while keeping the original file intact? I've tried creating a child class of PdfFileReader class and modifying the 'read' method as prescribed by my link above, however, I've found that that leads to several import dependency issues that I'd like to avoid.</p>  <p>Is there an easier way to do this?</p>
