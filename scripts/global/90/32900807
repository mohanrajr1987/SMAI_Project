<p>I am having difficulty with my implementation of  pdf.js in my rails app and making it responsive. </p>  <p>Here is the relevant code</p>  <pre><code>  &lt;div class = "col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-1 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 NoPadding"&gt;      &lt;iframe src="&lt;%= @publication.pdf.url %&gt;" class="embed-responsive-item" style = "border: 0" width="100%" height="1000" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Presently, if I resize my window on my pc it looks like this. (This is how I want it to look)</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/aafnw.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/aafnw.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>But if I use the developer tools and go to mobile phones it looks like this</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/635Wt.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/635Wt.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>This is how its actually looking on my mobile phone. Can someone offer and explanation for this and how I might achieve the first appearance?</p>  <p>Second question:</p>  <p>I have searched fro a more full featured pdf viewer for rails - something that will give me a toolbar at the top for zooming in and out etc. I need to display the pdfs inline so I don't want to use pdfjs_viewer-rails (I think you can only provide links to pdfs with this)</p>
