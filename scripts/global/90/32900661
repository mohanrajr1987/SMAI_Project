<p>I had worked with PDFsharp for unlocking secured PDFs, but it does not yet support the new security from PDFs created with Adobe 6 and later. Is there any solution better than this?</p>  <p>Code used in my project:</p>  <pre><code>PdfDocument objPdfReader = PdfReader.Open(inputPDFPath, PdfDocumentOpenMode.Import); PdfDocument objPdfDocument = new PdfDocument(); foreach (PdfPage page in objPdfReader.Pages) {     objPdfDocument.AddPage(page); } objPdfDocument.Save(outputPFPath); </code></pre>  <p>Please explain with some example of code, if you are suggesting to use other PDF libraries.</p>
