<p>Want to crop a specific x-y coordinates of existing pdf and place it to another pdf. How can i do it in itext. </p>  <p>I have tried cropping the pdf pages and the import the cropped pages to another pdf. I have used CROPBOX for cropping. But there is a small problem. After cropping the page  it looks cropped. But when I import the cropped pdf to a new pdf it shows the whole pdf page not the cropped part.</p>
