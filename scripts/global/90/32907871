<p>I'm working with an application written in C++ on Visual Studio that use MFC. I have a <code>CDialog</code> that have inside a <code>CListCtrl</code> in report mode, filled with a lot of data.</p>  <p>Want I need is <strong>create a PDF file</strong> with the same items (the grid of data) that I have in the <code>CListCtrl</code>. What is the best (and easy) way to do that?</p>  <p>Another <strong>thing</strong>: in my app I just have a class that is able to create a PDF starting from a <code>CDC*</code> (a draw on my device context) but for use that, I need to create <strong>the "draw"</strong> that will go on PDF, by my hand... so I should draw all with class like <code>CPen</code>, <code>LineTo</code>, etc; in order to avoid this procedure, you know some trick to have, starting from a <code>CListCtrl</code>, the draw of a grid filled with the items? Like a grid in Excel...</p>  <p>Hope my question is clear; I'm pretty newbie...</p>
