<p>I have been following the 'Chapter 8: Filling out interactive forms' iText example (code and pdfs at <a href="http://itextpdf.com/examples/iia.php?id=154" rel="nofollow">http://itextpdf.com/examples/iia.php?id=154</a>) and have noticed a number of appearance-related issues which also manifest themselves in the example pdfs.</p>  <p>The example features a list of radio buttons (classic dot within a circle) and a list of checkboxes (crossed box with a red background). So far so good. However the pdf generated after programmatically filling in these fields is visually inconsistent. The radio buttons have all reverted to squares and the selected ('Spanish') has a wingdings (?) cross within it rather than a dot. The fields are all still editable. When I select a different radio button, the previously selected radio button reverts to an empty circle. The newly selected field has changed from an empty square to a dotted circle. This can also be observed with the checkboxes.</p>  <p>Is there any way to fill the fields whilst preserving their original appearances?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
