<p>I have an issue with wget that I'm experiencing.  I'm working on a studio where I download multiple pdf's via wget and I export them into a master file.  The code that I'm utilizing is: </p>  <pre><code>wget -i wgetURL [which contains all of my urls] -O wgetURLDownloads </code></pre>  <p>The problem that I'm experiencing is each iteration of a download overwrites the previous download.  So, where I'm expecting to see multiple files, I'm only seeing the one.  </p>  <p>Any suggestions?  </p>  <p>TL;DR:  I'm using wget to download multiple (60+) pdfs and outputting them as one file.  It's not working as expected though.  Halp!</p>
