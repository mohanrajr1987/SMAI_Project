<p>I have access to a scanner at my library which can create "searchable PDFs."  These are PDFs that show the exact image of a scanned document, but there is a kind of hidden text in the PDF that can be selected when you try to select a portion of the image that contains text.  In this way you can copy and paste text or search for text in the scanned document.  This is VERY useful.  It's an awesome improvement over raw scanned images.  I also have several apps on my mac that can create this kind of searchable PDF from a scanned document or a raw image.</p>  <p>Now it's obvious from any who has ever used OCR that the process of converting images to text is not 100% accurate, so the text that you search or copy will not be correct in some places.</p>  <p>So I search for quite some time to find an application that would load a searchable PDF and allow me to repair the hidden searchable text without reformatting or modifying the original scanned image.</p>  <p>Does anyone know of a tool (or library API) that would allow this?</p>  <p>It's worth saying here that I tried the latest version of Adobe Acrobat DC for Mac, and it doesn't seem to even allow me to <em>view</em> the hidden searchable text, much less edit it.  It does allow me to replace scanned image with the results of it's own OCR process so that I could edit and save the document.  But this would produce horrible results for any of the scanned documents that I am using.  It seems designed for editing a "native PDF" not editing a scanned document.</p>  <p>I have also tried ABBYY FineReader with no luck.</p>
