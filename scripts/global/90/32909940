<p>I am trying to convert pdf pages to canvas using <code>pdf.js</code>. I used the answer in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15341010/render-pdf-to-single-canvas-using-pdf-js-and-imagedata">Render .pdf to single Canvas using pdf.js and ImageData</a> by K3N to achieve this. The code is avaliable here <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/epistemex/LUNaJ/" rel="nofollow">Fiddle1</a>. </p>  <p>The problem is that this seems to work with certain pdfs only. </p>  <p>For example the code works fine for <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.0102v2.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.0102v2.pdf</a> in <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/LUNaJ/126/" rel="nofollow">Fiddle2</a>. </p>  <p>However, when I tried the same code for <a href="http://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/papers/google.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/papers/google.pdf</a> in <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/LUNaJ/82/" rel="nofollow">Fiddle3</a> it failed to work. </p>  <p>Why is this happening and can it be fixed?</p>
