<p>I'm wanting a process that will go through some directories and subdirectories and convert TIFF images to PDF.  however I want all the TIFF files in the subdirectories to be in a single multipage PDF.</p>  <p>I've gotten <code>PythonMagick</code> installed and I can progress through the directories however when I go to write the image as a PDF the program just stops.  stepping through and debugging shows that the script just terminates at this point.  I don't receive any errors when it does this.  Can anybody help me understand what's going on?  Am I not performing this function correctly?</p>  <p>Here's an example of the directory structure</p>  <pre><code>&gt; first level     &gt; second level         &gt; file1.TIF         &gt; file2.TIF         ... </code></pre>  <p>and I would want the <code>file1.TIF</code>, <code>file2.TIF</code>, and other .TIFs to be compiled into one multipage pdf.</p>  <p>Now here's the code I'm using:</p>  <pre><code>import os import PythonMagick  workDir = os.chdir(""""C:/fileDirectory/""") beginingDir = os.getcwd() for directories in os.listdir(os.getcwd()):     firstLevel = beginingDir+'\\'+directories     for subdir in os.listdir(directories):         secondLevel = firstLevel+'\\'+subdir+'\\'         for tiffFile in os.listdir(directories+'\\'+subdir):             outFile = ''+subdir+'.pdf'             if tiffFile.endswith(".TIF"):                 print secondLevel+tiffFile                 try:                     img = PythonMagick.Image(secondLevel+'\\'+tiffFile)                     img.magick('PDF')                     img.write(secondLevel+outFile)                 except:                     print 'Problem processing' </code></pre>
