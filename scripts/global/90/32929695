<p>Right now I open a pdf file in foxit, sometimes I hit a buton and a lot of times many chapters in my textbook will be deleted. right now all pdfs files cannot be edited but how do I make files be in a mode that nothing in there can be deleted? is there a protected mode feature? Because I like foxit better than adobe pdf reader? or can I disable all features include deleting materials from pdf files?</p>
