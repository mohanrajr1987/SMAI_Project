<p>I am working through a homework assignment and with each line of code I write I like to compile my pdf on knitr to make sure everything is running smoothly. However, When I compile something very simple without any R code and just words, I get an "Overfull \hbox (5.68623pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 54--55" error and my pdf does not run. The weirder part is that my error says "at lines 54--55" when my entire document is only 9 lines long. I have googled my error and I have found things like "tabularx" and I have tried it but I continually get this error. Does anyone have any idea what I am doing wrong?</p>  <p>Thank you so much everyone, I really appreciate it!
