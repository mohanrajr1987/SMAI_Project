<p>Iâ€™m trying to make an Android note application with free opensource PDF library, but having a hard time realizing PDF reader.</p>  <p>What library can I use to render PDF file in my app which acts as a PDF reader so that I can utilize it as a canvas to write something onto it?</p>  <p>I think PDFClown and PDFBox should be good one. What do you think? Do they have enough functions to realize PDF viewer? I tried but it doesn't look like it can.</p>  <p>Thank you</p>
