<p>I managed to get the Background-Color of my texfield rounded by selecting borders, rounding them and then turning them off again. But when the field is highlighted (using <code>app.runtimeHighlight = true;</code>) in Adobe Reader there's no rounding anymore. Is there a way to round the Highlights using Adobe Livecycle-Designer? </p>  <p>Not Highlighted:<a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/CQICg.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/CQICg.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a> Highlighted (no rounding):<a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/JkguO.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/JkguO.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
