<p>A client told me when she opened my html email on her iPhone (don't know which OS) a PDF (linked to in the body of the email) opened in the middle of the email. I don't have a device testing service and I didn't find this to be the case in any of the many email clients and devices I tested on. It is a regular link to a location "<a href="http://url/loation/file.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://url/loation/file.pdf</a>". It is set to target _blank. Is there a way to include a link to a document in the body of an email that will prevent this from happening? Perhaps I should take this to Litmus or MailChimp. </p>
