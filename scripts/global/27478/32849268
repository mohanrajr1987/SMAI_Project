<p>Ideally, I would like to collect data from members.</p>  <p>First Issue: They would go to a form and either select their name with a drop down box or if they are a new user they can write their names in which it would add to the spreadsheet. They only have access to the Form.</p>  <p>Is this possible through code, and how would I go about doing that?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
