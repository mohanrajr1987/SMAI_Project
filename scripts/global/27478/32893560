<p>Under "Removing Unneeded Code" here: <a href="https://github.com/google/gdata-objectivec-client/wiki/BuildingTheLibrary" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/google/gdata-objectivec-client/wiki/BuildingTheLibrary</a></p>  <p>One is instructed to list the C-Flag for the framework you are using. It gives one example only. I have looked everywhere and can not find a list of the others. Some are obvious I'm sure, like Contacts. But for Sheets is it Sheets or Spreadsheets for example? Does anyone know if there is a list of these somewhere?</p>
