<p>I need a Sheets formula for a Year to Date field. Essentially, I need to sum up the cells to the left of a given cell, up and to the 11 previous cells (there are multiple years in a single row). In Excel, this is accomplished via OFFSET and a -Width value. Sheets won't play nice with -Width. I have no idea what to do. Does anyone have any suggestions?</p>  <p>For what it's worth, the formula that doesn't work in Sheets (but does in Excel) is as follows:</p>  <pre><code>=SUM(OFFSET(Forecast!$B$12,ROW($A13)-ROW($A$12),MATCH(Report!$I$1,Months,0)+2,1,-$I$2)) </code></pre>  <p>Where -$I$2 is a variable number of months field.  </p>  <p>Any help?</p>
