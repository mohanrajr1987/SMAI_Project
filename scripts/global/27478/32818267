<p>I'm trying to extract information sent to me on a regular basis from messages in g-mail. I would like to extract data from the emails and have it added to a spreadsheet within google sheets.</p>  <p>I have absolutely no experience with this type of programming and I have been using trial and error to try and figure this out. I have had no luck so far and all I can get is for the spreadsheet to get the null value written on it.</p>  <p>I am trying to use regular expressions to parse the data I need and then from there I am using appendRow to write to the spreadsheet.</p>  <pre><code>function processInboxToSheet() {  var start = 0; var threads = GmailApp.getInboxThreads(start, 100); var SPREADSHEET_URL =    "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18TzTzylbmu-g2lQyZo-YoscxW8SIK7a-tg/edit?usp=sharing"; var SHEET_NAME = 'Sheet1'; var result = [];   var spreadsheet = SpreadsheetApp.openByUrl(SPREADSHEET_URL); var qs_sheet = spreadsheet.getSheetByName(SHEET_NAME);  for (var i = 0; i &lt; threads.length; i++) { var messages = threads[i].getMessages();  var content = messages[0].getRawContent();  if (content) { </code></pre>  <p>I think my problem lies here:</p>  <pre><code>  var tmp;   var stringToParse = "*Longitude* W119.37938";   tmp = stringToParse.match(/d{1,4}\.\d{5}/);   var username = (tmp &amp;&amp; tmp[1]) ? tmp[1].trim() : 'No username';      qs_sheet.appendRow([username]);    Utilities.sleep(500);  }  }  }; </code></pre>  <p>Thanks for any help!</p>
