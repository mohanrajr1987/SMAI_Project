<p>I would like to use <a href="http://timeline.knightlab.com/index.html" rel="nofollow">TimelineJS</a> to create a timeline of my team recruitment. </p>  <h3>Context</h3>  <p>To bootstrap the project and as I will be the only one to work on it at first I'm willing to use their <a href="http://timeline.knightlab.com/index.html#make" rel="nofollow">Make a Timeline tool</a>. It uses Google spreadsheet to back the data.</p>  <p>However, as the project evolve I'm willing to open it up to other devs in my team and <strong>do not want the requirement of a Google account</strong> (you know NSA and stuff), but switch to <a href="http://timeline.knightlab.com/docs/json-format.html" rel="nofollow">TimelineJS <code>JSON</code></a> to embed in our project/VCS.</p>  <h3>Question</h3>  <p>How do I convert/export the spreadsheet into it's <code>JSON</code> form? Command-line or online tools are OK.</p>
