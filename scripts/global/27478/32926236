<p>Trying to make a spreadsheet on google sheets that scrapes data from a site.</p>  <p>I'm trying to get the sell price of items from rsbuddy exchange, eg:</p>  <pre><code>https://rsbuddy.com/exchange/?id=1745 </code></pre>  <p>I have the code on google sheets as:</p>  <pre><code>=IMPORTxml("https://rsbuddy.com/exchange/?id=1745","//*[@id='sell-price']") </code></pre>  <p>But instead of showing me <code>1734gp</code> it comes up as <code>---</code> on the sheet. I've tried adding <code>/text()</code> at the end of the query for the <code>importxml</code> but it doesn't change anything. </p>  <p>I'm guessing the solution is something similar?</p>
