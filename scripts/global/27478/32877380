<p>I've been looking into how to count cells with the countif function, and how to count cells that are colored using scripts and custom functions (like this thing: <a href="http://pastebin.com/4Yr095hV" rel="nofollow">http://pastebin.com/4Yr095hV</a>), but how would i count cells with a specific string AND color?</p>  <p>Example, I want to count every cell containing the word "one" that has a fill color of white.</p>  <p>EDIT: I was told to add what i had so far, but I am not sure what was meant by that. For counting cells with a specific string I used:</p>  <p>=COUNTIF(A1:A247,"string")</p>  <p>and for counting cells that are colored i used this what was on this page: <a href="http://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/23881/google-spreadsheet-calculating-shaded-cells">http://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/23881/google-spreadsheet-calculating-shaded-cells</a></p>  <p>but i still don't know how to combine these two TOGETHER.</p>
