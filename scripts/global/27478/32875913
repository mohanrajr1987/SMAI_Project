<p>We have a column that contains links to PDFs that starts on line 4 (e.g B4:B). I am trying to find a way to automatically download the PDF files that are accessed via the links to a folder on Drive. This is what I have so far:</p>  <pre><code>function savePDFs() {   var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet();   var data = sheet.getDataRange().getValues();   for (var i = 3; i &lt; data.length; i++) {     Logger.log(data[i][1]);   } } </code></pre>  <p>Presumably the above code would write the links starting in column B (index value of [1]) on row 4 (i value of 3) (ie., B4) until the bottom of the data set (eg., data.length()).</p>  <p>I'm now confused about how to access and save the PDF link that are written in the logger to a folder.</p>  <p>Would someone be willing to help me out? I'm currently having to go to each link, click Save Link As... and then navigate to the folder that I'd like to save the linked PDF to. My hope is to modify the above process using code.</p>  <p><strong>Update</strong>: I found this bit of code <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22735798/write-a-google-app-script-to-store-a-pdf-from-url-in-a-specific-folder-in-google">here</a> that may help me out. Note, I changed the PDF link to a currently valid PDF link.</p>  <pre><code>var urlOfThePdf = 'http://download.p4c.philips.com/l4b/9/929000277411_eu/929000277411_eu_pss_aenaa.pdf';// an example of online pdf file var folderName = 'GAS';// an example of folder name  function saveInDriveFolder(){   var folder = DocsList.getFolder(folderName);// get the folder   var file = UrlFetchApp.fetch(urlOfThePdf); // get the file content as blob    folder.createFile(file);//create the file directly in the folder } </code></pre>  <p>Okay, I'm going to go and noodle with the data that is in the logger to confirm that the data is in properly formatted PDF links, then I'm going to test this new bit of code out. I feel like I'm getting close.</p>
