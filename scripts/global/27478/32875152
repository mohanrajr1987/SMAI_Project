<p>I have seen some answers to this question but I ask again because the answers are not clear. Question is, how can you edit an IMPORTHTML function in google spreadsheet to automatically refresh data using new parameters?</p>  <p>Example, =IMPORThtml("<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_forwarding" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_forwarding</a>","table",1) will import table 1. In the same tab, I have modified the formula to automatically change from Table 1 to Table 2 by simply inputting any table number in place of 2 in a given cell. The Function looks ok but I would like the output to be actual data dump than just the formula. I have tried EVALUATE and INDIRECT functions but unsuccessful. Please help?</p>  <p>Sheet1 G1: =IMPORThtml("<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_forwarding" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_forwarding</a>","table", G2: input cell for inputting any table number, example, input value 2 G3: ="="&amp;G1&amp;G2</p>
