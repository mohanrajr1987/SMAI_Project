<p>At our company we have a Google Spreadsheets which is shared by a link with different employees. This spreadsheet is saved on a Google Drive to which only I have access. The link is configured as such that anyone with the link can edit the spreadsheet since all employees need to be able to make changes to the file.</p>  <p>Although this is very useful, it also presents a risk in the form of data loss. If a user were to (accidentally) delete or alter the wrong data and saves the file, this data is permanently lost.</p>  <p>To prevent this I was wondering if it is possible to automatically have a backup created, say every day. Ideally, this backup is saved in the same Google Drive. I know I could install the desktop client and have the file backed up by our daily company backup, but it seems a bit ridiculous to install it for just one file. I'm sure there has to be another solution to this, ie with scripts.</p>
