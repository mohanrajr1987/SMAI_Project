<p>As we know the code related with Android ART can be found <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/art/" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>  <p>Looking through the source we can find the source of ART build tools, e.g. <code>dex2oat</code>, <code>dexdump</code>, <code>oatdump</code>, etc.</p>  <p>Has anyone seen any proper guide how to build and run any of the tools on Unix/Windows based machines?</p>
