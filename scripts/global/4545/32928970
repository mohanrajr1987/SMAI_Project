<p>I have a general question. I have been programming using Integrated development environment, for short (IDE).  But I was watching a course in YouTube on Data Structure. The Lecturer said to his students that each one must know how to compile and run through a command a line. The question is: Why should programmers must know how to do that ?  Thank you. </p>
