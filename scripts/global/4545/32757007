<p>I've been trying to create C bindings for a Python library following an official tutorial presented by the developer of the latter library using Cython (<a href="https://www.ibisc.univ-evry.fr/~fpommereau/SNAKES/snakes-out-of-python.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.ibisc.univ-evry.fr/~fpommereau/SNAKES/snakes-out-of-python.html</a>).</p>  <p>The <em>cythonization</em> of the library works perfectly. However, when calling the creation of the library file with <strong>distutils.core.setup</strong> on <em>Mac OS X 10.10.5</em>, it produces a file <em>.so</em>. However, when I need to compile the example <em>.c</em> file with the library, I end up having the following error message:</p>  <pre><code>ld: can't link with bundle (MH_BUNDLE) only dylibs (MH_DYLIB) file './libsnk.so' for architecture x86_64 </code></pre>  <p>I've looking through the documentation of <strong>distutils.core.setup</strong> to see if there was any way to specify the type of file generated (in my case <em>.dylib</em>), unsuccessfully.</p>  <p>I've tried to follow the tutorial using a virtual machine running <em>Ubuntu 14.04.3</em> and I was able to make it work easily.</p>  <p>Is there a way to overcome this problem? Is there a way to specify to <strong>distutils.core.setup</strong> that it must generate a file with the <em>.dylib</em> format? Is there a way to make it work with <em>distutils.core.setup</em> still generating a file with the <em>.so</em> format?</p>  <p>Thank you for your answers</p>
