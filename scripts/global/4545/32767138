<p>Can you have .NET bytecode compiled straight into machine code?</p>  <p>I want to do this so I can increase execution speed. And I am talking about compiling the CLR bytecode only, and not direct source code compilation for C# or something. So, I can compile any .NET language to machine language by first compiling it to CLR bytecode, and after all the tests and prototyping is done, I can compile it to machine code.</p>
