<p>I've been having a look over the PHP-SRC project, and I've read over the brief development guide at: <a href="http://php.net/build-setup.php" rel="nofollow">http://php.net/build-setup.php</a></p>  <p>However being relatively new to C (but not new to programming), I am a little taken aback by the thought that I need to recompile every time I need to test a change.</p>  <p>When writing in PHP, I can bolt on a small snippet to see if <code>x == y</code> at a certain point of execution and test it almost immediately.  But before I start diving in a project as large as PHP, I want to know if I am mistaken in that I would need to build the entirety of the source to test small changes.</p>  <p>Is there a stage in the build process where small changes can be compiled into an existing binary without waiting 10-20 minutes every time?</p>
