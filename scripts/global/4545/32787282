<p>I have some problems with sbt since quite some time. It needs several compilation runs to catch up with changes and it finds everytime something new to compile until everything is done. It does not correctly identify all dependencies to be recompiled in one go as it does usually.</p>  <p>I'm trying to figure out since when, but it happens I think since I upgrade vom 13.6 to 13.9. Although if I revert now, I can still reproduce it.</p>  <p>The problem persist even when I do a clean project checkout and clean everything. Does anyone have an idea why this might be happening?</p>  <p>Here is a example output, between calls to test:compile nothing changed of course in the source files.</p>  <p>Any idea how to debug or even fix this?</p>  <pre><code>&gt; test:compile [info] Compiling 31 Scala sources to &lt;project&gt;\target\scala-2.11\classes...
