<p>I'm trying to compile my program on the command line and I got this error. It was pointing to the pthread_create line in the following code. I have the correct import for pthreads and I am running on Ubuntu so I know that's not the problem. Otherwise, I'm clueless about what's going on.</p>  <pre><code>int main() {     pthread_t thinker;     if(pthread_create(&amp;thinker, NULL, thinker, NULL)) {          perror("ERROR creating thread.");     }     pthread_join(thinker, NULL);     return 0; } </code></pre>
