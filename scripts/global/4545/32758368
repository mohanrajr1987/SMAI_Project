<p>I'm having troubles to make Qt creator compiling with MVSC compiler, so far I used to compile with MinGW and GDB Debugger which are native settings in Qt creator. I think that the compilation (MVSC) works now, but that I'm having issues with the debugger which makes impossible to launch my application. Every time I start to debug (F5), I have immediately the following message: <a href="http://img11.hostingpics.net/pics/984038errorMsgCDB.png" rel="nofollow">http://img11.hostingpics.net/pics/984038errorMsgCDB.png</a> So I can't even open the program. When I run (Ctrl + R) I see this in the output tab: <a href="http://img11.hostingpics.net/pics/137526outputMsgCDB.png" rel="nofollow">http://img11.hostingpics.net/pics/137526outputMsgCDB.png</a></p>  <p>I have installed Visual Studio 2013, the Debugging Tools for Windows, Windows SDK for Windows 7, and I'm working on a pc with Windows 7 64 bits.</p>  <p>My Build &amp; Run settings in Qt creator look like that:</p>  <ol> <li><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/wzlKk.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/wzlKk.png" alt="Kits"></a></li> <li><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/m4dd8.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/m4dd8.png" alt="Qt versions"></a></li> <li><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ecoSB.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ecoSB.png" alt="Compilers"></a></li> <li><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/0OKAA.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/0OKAA.png" alt="Debuggers"></a></li> </ol>  <p>Can you help me please? I'm struggling for many days to make it work with    MVSC because I have to used a third-party library which only supports MVSC compilers.</p>
