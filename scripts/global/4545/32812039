<p>In my computer architecture class I just learned that running an algebraic expression involving multiplication through a multiplication circuit can be more costly than running it though an addition circuit, if the number of required multiplications are less than 3. Ex: 3x. If I'm doing this type of computation a few billion times, does it pay off to write it as: x + x + x or does the JIT optimizer optimize for this?</p>
