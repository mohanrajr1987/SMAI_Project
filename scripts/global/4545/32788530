<p>I am making a Dictionary project which gives <strong>English to English &amp; Urdu</strong> meaning and explanation &amp; vise versa when a user search a word. I am not currently using database &amp; I implemented <code>if</code> &amp; <code>else if</code> statements at this time I have code of more than 4000+ lines. When I compile the code this take some more time as usual project compilation. How can I improve the compilation time and should I use database for it.</p>  <p>Thanks...</p>
