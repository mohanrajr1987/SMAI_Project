<p>I am using bluetooth driver folder in Ubuntu, for compiling my special driver, even though i added 5 of my files,       obj-m := 1.o      obj-m := 2.o      obj-m := 3.o      obj-m := 4.o      obj-m := 5.o but it compiles only last one.  But it compiles all files for bluetooth driver fine. </p>  <p>Also, i am compiling just blueooth driver, so i dont have to compile whole kernel. </p>  <p>Anybody knows what I am doing wrong?</p>
