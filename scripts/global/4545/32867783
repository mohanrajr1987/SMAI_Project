<p>I am trying to build a project using 'mvn clean install' This gives me compilation error for some packages missing. When I look into the m2 folder, the local repository is not created.  How do I enforce the loading of dependencies before the compilation of the projec?</p>  <p>Some of the things I tried mvn clean install -U Delete the .project, .classpath, .settings</p>  <p>Any options?</p>
