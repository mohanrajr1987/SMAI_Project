<p>I am relatively new to Haskell and everything I have done has been completed through GHCi, however, now I am trying to compile using GHC, however, I constantly get the error message <code>The IO action ‘main’ is not defined in module ‘Main’</code>, I have tried declaring <code>main = do</code>, however, I receive more errors then, namely <code>parse error on input ‘=’</code> from the line <code>fib 0 = 1</code>.</p>  <p>Here is the code I am working with:</p>  <pre><code>module Main where     fib :: Integer -&gt; Integer     fib 0 = 1     fib 1 = 1     fib x = fib (x - 1) + fib (x - 2) </code></pre>  <p>Thanks for any help in advance!</p>
