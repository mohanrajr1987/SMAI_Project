<p><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/RestrictedPython" rel="nofollow">RestrictedPython</a> module has a <a href="https://github.com/zopefoundation/RestrictedPython/blob/master/src/RestrictedPython/RCompile.py" rel="nofollow">restricted compiler</a> in which you can compile code and customize some python features. For example, you can replace the builtin <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/RestrictedPython#implementing-a-policy" rel="nofollow">print</a> function.</p>  <p>That's what I need to do. I need to compile some code but defining my own print function. I can't use this restricted compiler because it has a lot of restrictions I don't need at now.</p>  <p>Do you know any other compiler in which I can define my own print function?</p>
