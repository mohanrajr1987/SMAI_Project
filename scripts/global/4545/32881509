<p>I run some scenario which involves message exchanges between different binaries. I changed some code introducing some global variables and compiled. One of the binary failed. So I added a static library in that binary. The reason to add was say X.c contained use of global variables but whose reference were in some other file say Y.c. X.o was used in making this binary but not Y.o. So I added the static library which contained Y.o.  The problem I faced now is that the complete set up which involves this binary as well doesn't provide the desired output as it used to earlier in the same scenario. When I replace the impacted binary with the old binary keeping other binaries new, the scenario is successfully executed. What could be the possible issue?</p>  <p>Thanks in Advance</p>
