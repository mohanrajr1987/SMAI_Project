<p>I need to analyse classic ASP files in search of injected malware. The cases routinely contain a lot of obfuscation, probably to make it harder using regexp, hashes or similar detection approaches. So, is there any way to "de-obfuscate" / parse a classic ASP source code and put it into a proper parse tree / compiled version to ease analysis and get rid of all the eval, gzips, base64s, and whatever else obfuscation? I've found <a href="https://aspclassiccompiler.codeplex.com/SourceControl/latest" rel="nofollow">https://aspclassiccompiler.codeplex.com/SourceControl/latest</a> and if no-one has a better idea, I guess I'd have to analyse that project and create something out of it to fit my needs, unless there's something else available.</p>
