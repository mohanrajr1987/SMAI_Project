<p>I have a very big source code, say 2000 classes. I make different executables(.ipa) using the source code. The changes among the executables are some keys in the info.plist file and the product name. </p>  <p>Whenever I change the product name Xcode compiles all the source files(2000+) again. If I don't change the product name and change only the info.pilst file it compiles only the info.plist file which indicates that I do not have any weird things in the source code.</p>  <p>I don't want the files to be compiled again and again as it takes long time, an incremental compile with a different product name is really nice to have. </p>  <p>Is there anyway I can achieve it?. Or is there a key like <code>CFBundleName</code> that controls the name displayed under the app icon without making the Xcode compile again.( Changing only <code>CFBundleName</code> doesn't make the Xcode to recompile however it is not changing the bundle name unless the project is cleaned. UPDATE: Touching the info.plist make it work) .</p>
