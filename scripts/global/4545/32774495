<p>I want to ask about a problem about c/c++ compile  I have project need to reuse a library wrote base on Cpp language.  But I need to reuse the library in a project which work on a platform only support c language (UEFI)  I want to ask :<br>  -Is it possible to write a wrap API in C code to call all function in the Cpp library ? </p>  <p>-And After compiled All of these (Wrap API, CppLibrary,My Source project) by C compiler =>Will  the build  application is working in my platform (UEFI)? "</p>  <p>( Assumption than both Cpp library and My project source in compile in the same compile like (visual c 2013) ) </p>  <p>Thank you </p>
