<p>I have a project written for golang 1.4 and recently ported to golang 1.5 (not too much work was done actually). The thing is, the project is speed-sensitive and I want it to be as fast as possible. </p>  <p>One possible solution that I found is using gccgo compiler. But when I try to run it:</p>  <pre><code>go build -compiler gccgo main.go </code></pre>  <p>I have several errors:</p>  <pre><code>go build code.google.com/p/lzma: : fork/exec : no such file or directory go build github.com/gorilla/websocket: : fork/exec : no such file or directory go build github.com/satori/go.uuid: : fork/exec : no such file or directory go build github.com/fatih/structs: : fork/exec : no such file or directory go build ws/json: : fork/exec : no such file or directory </code></pre>  <p>So the question is how can i fix this? Or is there another solution to make it faster?</p>
