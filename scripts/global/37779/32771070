<p>I use Jackson for parsing JSON files. The file is passed as a stream to Jackson to create a parser. Here is the sample code :</p>  <pre><code>JsonFactory f = new JsonFactory(); JsonParser parser = f.createParser(inputStream); </code></pre>  <p>I know that createParser() prefetch data from stream into an input buffer. Subsequent call to nextToken() is served from this inputBuffer. In my application, along with parsing, I also want to keep track of the file offset of the inputStream until which I have consumed the data. Due to this buffering, offset tracking does not work. </p>  <p>Does anyone know if there is a way to disable buffering in Jackson? Or, is there an API call that I can use to determine if the buffer has data that has not yet been consumed? </p>
