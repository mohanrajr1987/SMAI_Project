<p>I´m having problems mapping an object using Jackson. </p>  <p>The issue happens when I map a JSON object that sometimes misses an item from the class. </p>  <p>I´m trying to find out how to set up the configurations in order to not to crash when the JSON does not have all the fields of the class.</p>  <p>I´ve already tried with:</p>  <pre><code>MAPPER.configure(DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES, false);  @JsonIgnoreProperties(ignoreUnknown = true) </code></pre>  <p>This is the error:</p>  <pre><code>com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonMappingException: Instantiation of [simple type, class com.non.real.package.Like] value failed: null (through reference chain: com.non.real.package.CardFeed["likes"]-&gt;com.non.real.package.CardLikes["likes"]-&gt;java.util.ArrayList[0])   "likes": {          "count": 0,          "likes": []        } </code></pre>  <h2>EDIT:</h2>  <p>Trying different solutions I´ve found out that the Like object is extending the class Model of  ActiveAndroid. Removing that "extension" It does work fine. I think the Model class does not work fine when it has a NULL or EMPTY. </p>
