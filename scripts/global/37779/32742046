<p>I have some Jackson annotated files used for serialization, but I need to change part of its behaviour without changing those files.</p>  <p>Specifically I want to mixin</p>  <pre><code>@JsonIgnoreProperties(ignoreUnknown = true) </code></pre>  <p>So that it will not throw an <code>UnrecognizedPropertyException</code> when some internal properties get added.</p>  <p>How would I create the mixin and register it onto my <code>ObjectMapper</code>?</p>
