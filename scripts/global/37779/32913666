<p>I am using Jackson v2.5.4 with the JaxbAnnotationIntrospector. When I try to deserialize one of my classes, I get the following error:</p>  <pre><code>    Could not resolve type id 'uid' into a subtype of [simple type, class app.Group]: known type ids = [Group, FilterGroup, ListGroup, filter_group, list_group]  at [Source: org.glassfish.jersey.message.internal.ReaderInterceptorExecutor$UnCloseableInputStream@34e4e61; line: 3013, column: 7] (through reference chain: app.Model["groups"]-&gt;java.util.ArrayList[0]) </code></pre>  <p>The issue is that in the JSON being deserialized, the 'uid' value for the object is 'list_group' which is in the list of known ids.</p>  <pre><code>  "groups": [     {       "uid": "list_group",       "displayName": "Group 1",       "description": null     }   ] </code></pre>  <p>The JAXB annotations of the field are shown below:</p>  <pre><code>@XmlElementWrapper(name="groups") @XmlElements({     @XmlElement(name="list_group", type=ListGroup.class),     @XmlElement(name="filter_group", type=FilterGroup.class) }) private final List&lt;Group&gt; groups = Lists.newArrayList(); </code></pre>  <p>It is just confusing since the error message states that it cannot resolve the type, but the type is included in the list of known types mentioned in the same sentence. Is there anything I can do differently in order for the deserialization to work correctly?</p>  <p>Update:</p>  <p>Error could be related to this open issue on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-module-jaxb-annotations/issues/34" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-module-jaxb-annotations/issues/34</a>.</p>  <p>Would still appreciate any thoughts on how to workaround the issue.</p>
