<p>I have UI object that wraps JPA entity and in constructor of that UI object I do lazy loading of some properties. In that same constructor I need to know what JsonView is currently active so I dont lazy load some fields that are not needed if say its the List view. Is there way to find out from constructor what is current active JsonView at runtime. Or is there any other way to achieve what I described above.</p>
