<p>I have a data like this :</p>  <pre><code>[    {    "type":"animal"    "numlegs":4   }, {    "type":"car"    "country":"usa"   } ] </code></pre>  <p>I want that to be parsed into the following classes :</p>  <pre><code>public class Animal {     int numLegs; }  public class Car {     string country; } </code></pre>  <p>What is the best way to tell jackson that the class type is based on the value of a property in the JsonObject?</p>  <p>I have went through a lot of examples which talks about using <code>JsonTypeInfo</code> and <code>JsonSubTypes</code> annotation but that doesn't fit well here as there is no abstract class common to both the objects.</p>  <p>Any help is appreciated.</p>
