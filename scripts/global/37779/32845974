<p>i am using Netbeans and have built a rest webservice that returns JSON and i am seeing something that looks odd to me... in my response object the externalid field has no quotes but in the model that is being converted here it is a string... </p>  <pre><code>"apiName":"Test Case","duration":7644,"externalId":1234561019 </code></pre>  <p>if the externalId field has a letter in it, it comes up with quotes, but why is it treating the field like a number just because it happens to be a valid one when i have declared it a string?</p>  <p>Should have mentioned my maven imports are the following</p>  <pre><code>&lt;dependency&gt;     &lt;groupId&gt;org.codehaus.jackson&lt;/groupId&gt;     &lt;artifactId&gt;jackson-mapper-asl&lt;/artifactId&gt;     &lt;version&gt;1.9.10&lt;/version&gt; &lt;/dependency&gt; &lt;dependency&gt;     &lt;groupId&gt;org.json&lt;/groupId&gt;     &lt;artifactId&gt;json&lt;/artifactId&gt;     &lt;version&gt;20140107&lt;/version&gt; &lt;/dependency&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Thanks for any clues</p>
