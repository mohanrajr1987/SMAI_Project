<p>If my application crashes (in the hands of the end-user), I want to get a list of all variables and fields available so I can debug easier. What I did before was index all classes in a package, and then recursively read and write (formatted) all variables in the object. I was also able to do static variables too.</p>  <p>I am wondering if it would be possible to do this with Jackson. Reading other questions, I might have to modify the <code>writeObject</code> method to allow static variables.</p>  <p>I know this is bad design and I shouldn't be reading and writing static fields, but this is for debug purposes only, I will not be deserializing it later.</p>
