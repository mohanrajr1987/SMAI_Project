<p>I am having an issue with the Jackson Json mapper which I can't figure out how to solve.</p>  <p>I am having a Spring MVC Rest application and the endpoints are converted to Json using Jackson.</p>  <p>Some of the result objects contain a type that I want to tamper with before it gets converted.</p>  <p>More specifically, a result object could look like this.</p>  <pre><code>ResultObject     - getDoubleMap() : DoubleMap         - getDoubleEntries() : List&lt;DoubleEntry&gt;         - toMap() : Map&lt;String, Double&gt; </code></pre>  <p>What I want to do is to not have Jackson convert the DoubleMap instance but much rather override it like this</p>  <pre><code>Object someJacksonMapInterceptor(Object object) {     if(object instanceof DoubleMap) {         return ((DoubleMap) object).toMap();     }     return object; } </code></pre>  <p>I have tortured google quite a while now and not a simple solution. Hope someone can advise.</p>  <p>Many thanks in advance.</p>
