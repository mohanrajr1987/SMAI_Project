<p>A Web service returns "location" objects with properties that map almost 1:1 to the fields of <code>android.location.Address</code>.  I've written a custom deserializer to handle them, and it works.</p>  <p>Occasionally the Web service returns garbage locations, i.e., latitude 0.0, longitude 0.0, other fields empty strings.  I'd like these garbage locations to be deserialized as a Java <code>null</code>.</p>  <p><strong>Is <code>JsonDeserializer#deserialize(...)</code> allowed to return <code>null</code>?</strong></p>  <p>I haven't simply tested this myself because:</p>  <ul> <li>The behavior of a particular version of Jackson is not a guarantee unless it's documented.</li> <li>It's quicker to write this question than mock the bogus input or write a separate test app.</li> <li>The answer might be beneficial to others.</li> </ul>
