<p>I've created a localstorage store, and stored demo values in it following this tutorial:</p>  <p><a href="http://sureshdotariya.blogspot.com/2013/03/understanding-local-storage-proxy-in.html" rel="nofollow">http://sureshdotariya.blogspot.com/2013/03/understanding-local-storage-proxy-in.html</a></p>  <p>And it all works fine, I've viewed the store data in the resources in chrome and it is there, and when I load the page it loads fine, no errors, but it shows no data, here's my view code:</p>  <pre><code>Ext.define('MyTest.view.SearchPanel', {     extend: 'Ext.Panel',     xtype: 'searchpanel',     config: {         layout: 'fit',         items: [         {             xtype: 'nestedlist',             title: 'Search Results',             displayField: 'Name',             store: {                      storeId: 'UserStore',                 fields: ['Name']             },         }]     } }); </code></pre>  <p>What am I missing here? Can I use local storage store as the store for the nested list? And if yes then why it shows "No items found", I've added the store in app.js, I tried requiring it in this view but that did not work.</p>  <p>Your help is appreciated, thanks.</p>
