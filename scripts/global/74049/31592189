<p>I am building a web app in Sencha Touch for which I need a chat service. I am thinking of using MongoDB and Node.js but don't know how to integrate either. Can someone point me in the right direction? I have been using local storage so far.</p>  <p>Any links to any tutorials would be much appreciated. Thanks!</p>
