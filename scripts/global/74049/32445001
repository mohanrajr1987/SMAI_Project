<p>I'm just releasing a new version of my Android app. The problem happens when the previous version is already installed in the device and you install the new apk (with a session started), the application doesn't clear the splashcreen and gets stucked. The only way to run the app, is clearing all the application data or uninstalling the previous release before installing the new one, what is wrong, because you shouldn't now uninstall any app when updating. </p>  <p>Have anyone had this problem? Anybody knows how to solve it?</p>  <p>I already tuned the package.json and everything works fine, excepts for this trouble.</p>  <p>I'm using <strong>cordova 5.0</strong> and <strong>sencha touch 2.4</strong>.</p>  <p>I create my package by using the command</p>  <p><strong>$ sencha app build package</strong> </p>  <p>and then </p>  <p><strong>$ cordova prepare android</strong></p>  <p>I think it may have something to be with the new sencha cache manager, but I don't have a clue on how to solve this. Can anybody help me, please?  Thank you!</p>
