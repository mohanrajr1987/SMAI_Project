<p>My Sencha Touch 2 javascript app (ST2.4.1) is running fine as a native app wrapped by Cordova, and also when run as web app with dev build (with Chrome in normal or incognito mode).</p>  <p>However, when I do a production build and try to access it via a browser (Chrome), some of the images do not show up or render in the app. I have confirmed that the images are included in the build and are on the server. The server is Tomcat. Interestingly, if I relaunch the browser in incognito mode, everything shows up just fine - all images show up as they should. See the screenshot below - notice how some of the rows are randomly missing the images? Also, the last image ("Dropbox") is cropped for some reason.</p>  <p>On a related note, when I do run into this problem, the order of the images also gets messed up.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/LAc6K.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/LAc6K.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>This is how the above screenshot looks like in incognito mode (as it should):</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/X83AX.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/X83AX.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>I have completely cleared out the cache manifest, so it includes nothing. Any ideas how I can fix this? Why is it working fine in incognito mode but not in normal mode on the same server?</p>  <p>Please let me know if I can provide any further details to clarify the problem.</p>  <p>Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks!</p>
