<p>I have created an iPad app in Sencha Touch 2.0.0 which has been working perfectly on iOS 8 &amp; iOS 7. But after upgrading to iOS 9, anything after the overlays just breaks/freezes the app.</p>  <p>I have found that the latest version of Sencha Touch doesn't have this problem. But due to some performance issues, sencha Touch's latest version can not be used in our app.</p>  <p>The issue exists in the components like Messagebox, date picker, Action sheet etc.</p>  <p>Could anyone please suggest me a solution for this ?</p>  <p>Many thanks</p>
