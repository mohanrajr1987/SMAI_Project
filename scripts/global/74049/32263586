<p>I have one very unpleasant issue under IE on Lumia.  I'm developing mobile application with Sencha Touch 2 and  use pop event of Main view to attach some logic: <a href="http://docs.sencha.com/touch/2.4/2.4.2-apidocs/#!/api/Ext.navigation.View-event-pop" rel="nofollow">http://docs.sencha.com/touch/2.4/2.4.2-apidocs/#!/api/Ext.navigation.View-event-pop</a> Under all browsers the logic is called and application working properly instead  IE on Nokia Lumia 630. The idea is to be executed some logic when  the user click on back button and go to main view. Events attached to backbutton event not fires at all. A also tried onbeforeunload on  onunload events but there are also not called.  I would be very grateful for any ideas and recommendations on how to solve this problem.</p>
