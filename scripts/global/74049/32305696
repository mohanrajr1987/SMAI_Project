<p>Ext store proxy api object can be assigned from the definition. But I wanted to append a base-url to the api-request-links. I know this can be done from the controllers or via the init functionalities of the store. But it seemed quite a workaround to me.</p>  <p>I was trying to create a "getBaseUrl()" function in the application scope and expected it to be used throughout the application where ever there is a url or api store property defined something cleaner like this</p>  <pre><code>... ... store:{ myStore:{ ... proxy:{     ...     api{     read: ApplicationName.getBaseUrl()+"the/rest/of/the/read-url",     ...     }     ... ... </code></pre>  <p>But I was unable to get the application context or controller context within the Ext.data.proxy.Server:api object. Can you help me out with a cleaner approach, instead of defining the store and applying the api from the controllers or assigning the proxy-api from the init of the store.</p>
