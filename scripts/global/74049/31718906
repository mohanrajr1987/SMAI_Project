<p>I got the following classes on a Sencha Web App:</p>  <p><strong>Baseclass</strong></p>  <p>and <strong>AClass</strong> extends <em>Baseclass</em> with xtype aclass</p>  <p>and <strong>BClass</strong> extends <em>Baseclass</em> with xtype bclass</p>  <p>Usually I usually would use <em>Ext.Viewport.down('aclass')</em> to get a certain instance of a class. My question is if there's a way to get all instances of the Baseclass?</p>  <p>Thanks for help!</p>
