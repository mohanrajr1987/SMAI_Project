<p>Could anybody give me step by step how to generate SDKs in Phonegap Build of an app made with Sencha Touch?</p>  <p>I have a lot researched on google and seen videos of sencha but are outdated, and as this is my first app I'm with many difficulties. </p>  <p>Examples of outdated things that are showing in the tutorials and videos: When do the command 'sencha phonegap init' in the app are not creating reference to the 'config.xml' file or to the 'cordova.js' file on the file 'app.json'.</p>  <p>What is the correct sequence of commands to generate the app by Phonegap Build (without installing any native SDK on my machine)?</p>  <p>Could you help me with this?</p>
