<p>I load a data, it is from a rest API:</p>  <pre><code>Ext.ModelManager.getModel('Test.model.DogDetails').load(12); </code></pre>  <p>Yes, it is loaded. I can see <code>api.example.com/dogdetails/12</code> in the network events. It has one dog ("array").</p>  <p>I have list inside a container:</p>  <pre><code>Ext.define('Test.view.DogDetails', {     extend: 'Ext.Container',     xtype: 'DogDetails',     //singleton: true,     config: {         layout: 'fit',         items : [             {                 xtype: 'list',                 store: 'DogDetails',                 itemTpl: [                     '{NAME}'                 ],                 variableHeights: true             }         ]     } }); </code></pre>  <p>Then, I click a button to pop up the view.</p>  <pre><code>this.dogD = Ext.widget('DogDetails', {     title: "hghgh" }); Ext.ComponentQuery.query('dogNavigationView')[0].push(this.dogD); </code></pre>  <p>And the list is emty. I have checked the list's store and it says that the store has never been loaded. So, it seems that this is not the way how to load the data. But then I have tried to <code>Test.view.DogDetails.items.items[0].getStore().getModel().load(12);</code> This one loads the store that I want but it doesn't load the <code>api.example.com/dogdetails/12</code>, it loads <code>api.example.com/dogdetails/</code> which is emty. Also I have tried to use singelton, but then <code>Test.view.DogDetails.items.items[0]</code> doesn't exists.</p>  <p>What is the proper way to pop up a list with a store??</p>
