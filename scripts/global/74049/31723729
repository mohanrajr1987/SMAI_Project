<p>I'm makign an app in Sencha touch 2.4.1. When I have it seems any Ext.Panel(grid, formpanel, tabpanel) child I can drag it around and it gets a translate3d value in style in debugger. When you drag the screen you get extra space on the left,top,bottom, right side of border, depends where you're dragging.</p>  <p>Here's a screen of the situation. Can anyone help out what setting/property to chnage so this thing will stop happening.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/AAK8a.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/AAK8a.png" alt="translate3d added in panel when you drag"></a></p>
