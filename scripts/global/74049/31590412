<p>I've been building (and running) Phonegap and Sencha Touch apps by prepending <code>sudo -E env "PATH=$PATH"</code> to the build command.</p>  <p>I've been told by several developers that running the build process using <code>sudo</code> is not a good idea.</p>  <p><strong>1. What are the consequences that arise from using <code>sudo</code> to build?</strong></p>  <p>While I do find running with <code>sudo</code> annoying (especially when I have to add all that <code>env</code> junk), I don't completely understand the issue.</p>  <p><strong>2. What is the alternative?</strong></p>  <p><code>chown</code> / <code>chmod</code> -ing the files scares me a little, but I don't see another way.</p>  <p><strong>Edit:</strong><br> I suppose I could alias <code>phonegap</code> to run with <code>sudo</code>, but I'm not comfortable with that solution. If I'm going to run <code>sudo</code> I want to be explicit about it.</p>
