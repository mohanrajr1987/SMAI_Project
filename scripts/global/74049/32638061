<p>I'm looking for an example of something I want to do or to hint how to do it. I want to create menu from one side of Viewport of Sencha Touch 2 and after this  to replace this menu with other menu. When I call </p>  <pre><code> Ext.Viewport.setMenu(menu, {      side: 'left'  }); </code></pre>  <p>It working OK but after I call setMenu with other menu the new attached menu replaces old menu and that is the idea. But the problem appears when I want to return other menu. Is there is a way to keep instance of old menu somewhere? I just do not want to recreate the previous menu again. I tried to replace second menu with Container but it is no so flexible like menu. </p>
