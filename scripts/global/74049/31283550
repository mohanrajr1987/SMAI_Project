<p>My app isn't able to load the store in android lollipop version but it's working fine in older versions of android. </p>  <p>It doesn't work in lollipop until I require the store in <strong>app.js</strong></p>  <pre><code>requires:['StoreA','StoreB'] </code></pre>  <p>Is there any library that can fix an issue like this, such as in chrome 43? </p>  <p>If I require more than 200 stores initially, it might affect the performance of the application. </p>
