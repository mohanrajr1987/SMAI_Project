<p>I've made an app in sencha. I'm trying to remotely build the app in PhoneGap and generate the .apk file. While running the following command:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>sencha app build native</p> </blockquote>  <p>I get the following "socket hang up" error <img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/n1to9.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>Is there a way to increase the time-out limit or anything else that can be done?</p>
