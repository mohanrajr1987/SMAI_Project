<p>I've created my own control to use for every day of the week and I used the name property so the control knows for which day it's used. On the initialize of the control I use the name property for calling tap events, but for some reason that name property is unidentified in minified code, it works fine in normal mode.</p>  <p>So is there something about production mode in Sencha Touch that makes it hard to use the name property.</p>  <p>Use of the name property:</p>  <pre><code>{   xtype: 'mycontrol',   name: 'monday' } </code></pre>
