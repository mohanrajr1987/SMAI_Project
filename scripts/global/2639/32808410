<p>I'm trying to design a dash board in WX form builder for Python. I'm having trouble trying to figure out how to keep two horizontal sizers that are children to a vertical sizer from expanding far apart from each other. Below is a screen shot describing what I am referring to:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/b6q0h.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/b6q0h.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p><em>The blue arrow represents that I want the textbox control and the label to move up closer to the first label.</em></p>  <p>My first instinct is that is had something to do with the wx.EXPAND etc flags however, I was not able to change those in a manner that made the sizers come closer to each other. It's almost like every time I place a sizer it automatically tries to fit everything in the entire window...which makes it difficult to place items in precise locations on the form. <em>Any suggestions on how to stop sizers from expanding to the entire frame window size?</em></p>  <p>My next course of action was to try and use a gridsizer or a flex grid sizer however, I've only used them through direct code, where you can select the exact location in the grid where you want to add a widget or object. With form builder, I'm finding that they are more difficult to use mainly because I can't insert objects at certain indices in the grid sizer. It inserts them sequentially:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>1,1 -> 1,2 -> 1,3 -> 1,i -> 2,1 -> 2,2 -> 2,3 -> 2,i -> j,i</p> </blockquote>  <p>Which means that if I need to change something in the grid...Its very difficult. <em>Is there something I'm missing that makes it easier to insert objects into the grid, other than sequentially?</em></p>  <p>Below is one of example of 5x5 grid sizer (not completely filled) where I have specified both the horizontal and vertical gaps = 0:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/B1Ifj.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/B1Ifj.png" alt="enter image description here"></a> <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/bLiPE.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/bLiPE.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Besides being able to replace the button with a textbox at 1,4, I notice that the horizontal gap is clearly not zero even though I specified 0 for vertical and horizontal gaps. This also makes it very hard to design the form. <em>Why is there a horizontal gap between buttons?</em> </p>
