<p>Hi I'm new to python and have started developing a GUI using wxpython. I just want to know the basic threading operation in wxpython. I have a main process which has OK &amp; Cancel Buttons and a child process derived from main with the OK and Cancel Buttons. I want to implement threading such a way that clicking OK button on main process must send a message to child process and child process must look for if any of it's process is running, if so, it has to wait for that process to finish and then receive the message from main process.Similarly the same with the Cancel button in the main process. Basically i want to see how child process receives message from main process and both work parallel. I'm trying with wx.CallAfter and wx.PostEvent and i'm confused with the threading concept here. Please someone help me. Thanks in advance</p>
