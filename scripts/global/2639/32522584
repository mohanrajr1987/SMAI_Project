<p>I have a wx.Frame with a Combobox. When a selection is made in the Combobox, a specific function is called.</p>  <p>I am having an undesirable effect with the ComboBox. While the ComboBox has focus, any movement of the mouse wheel changes the selection and, in consequence, a different function is triggered.</p>  <p>In practice it is very difficult to remember you have to put the widget out of focus to 'save' your original selection, so that, as the functions triggered take each several seconds to complete, usability of the GUI is not good.</p>  <p>I tried to catch the mouse event to no avail using</p>  <blockquote>   <p>self.Bind(wx.EVT_MOUSEWHEEL, self.donothing, self.mycombobox)</p> </blockquote>  <p>Which would be the best procedure to prevent mouse signals to affect the combobox ?</p>  <p><em>EDIT<br> If you want to play with code, here is some you can execute and test. Just execute, make a selection with mouse and then play de mousewheel. I do not want the selection to change. I have not been able to catch the event, whatever it is, emitted by the mousewheel.</em></p>  <pre><code>import wx  class Myframe(wx.Frame):     def __init__(self):         wx.Frame.__init__(self, None)         pan = wx.Panel(self)          self.cbx = wx.ComboBox(pan, -1, pos=(10,30),                             choices=["SEARCH", "SELECT", "PASS"],                             style=wx.CB_DROPDOWN )          self.cbx_2 = wx.ComboBox(pan, -1, pos=(10,60),                             choices=["LOOK", "GO", "FILL"],                             style=wx.CB_DROPDOWN )          self.Bind(wx.EVT_MOUSEWHEEL, self.do_nothing)  # to no avail         self.Bind(wx.EVT_COMBOBOX, self.on_selection, self.cbx)         self.Bind(wx.EVT_COMBOBOX, self.on_selection_2, self.cbx_2)      def on_selection(self, evt):         """I do not want this to be executed inadvertently when           moving mousewheel"""         print self.cbx.GetStringSelection()         #evt.Skip(False)  # this is the default behavior anyway      def on_selection_2(self, evt):         """this is another combobox. dont mind if mouse move it or not"""         print self.cbx.GetStringSelection()      def do_nothing(self, evt):         ""         print 'on events pit' # never catched !!!                 #evt.Skip(False)  # this is the default behavior anyway   if __name__ == "__main__":       App = wx.PySimpleApp()     Myframe().Show()     App.MainLoop() </code></pre>
