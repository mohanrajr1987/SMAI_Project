<p>I`m using wxPython in conjunctions with wxFormBuilder. I have a wxDataViewListCtrl with 5 columns to list my values. The user can select one or more rows (style = wxDV_MULTIPLE). If the user only select one row i can catch it with this method:</p>  <pre><code>def showContextTZM( self, event ):     if self.m_dvlc.HasSelection():         item_id = event.GetItem().GetID() </code></pre>  <p>If the user selects more than one row I only get the item where the cursor is placed. I did not find any method to get all selected items.</p>  <p>Thanks for answers.</p>
