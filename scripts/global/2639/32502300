<p>I had a wx script working on winxp (at work). it was upgraded to win7_64. I installed python2 and wxpython (both 32bit). now my script doesn't want to run. it says "ImportError: NumPy not found.". so I installed numpy from numpy.org, but it didnt change anything. I can import wx, I can import numpy, but when I try to run my wx script, it says that numpy is not installed. I removed and reinstalled everything but nothing changed. what to do?</p>
