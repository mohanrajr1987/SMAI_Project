<p>Am using the wx.grid, wx.aui to build the UI as shown in the attachment,  "Using gridlib-aui.png". The intention is to let the user configure parameters (P1/P2/P3...) over different use cases (U1/U2/U3...) using comparator (LE/GE/EQ etc), and corresponding values Value1=1, Value2=2 etc. This is all working fine. The grid lets me use a drop down for the comparator column so that the user can pick one of the choices for the comparator, instead of having to type it. Now when using a grid, the grid will become very unwieldy when there are 50 uses cases and 50 parameters for each use case. I want to use the gizmos.TreeListCtrl, so I can hide the nodes as required. I have attached the "Want_this.png" which I got by modifying the example for TreeListCtrl.py. I do not see how I can modify this so that the comparator column can be a drop-down. The ct_type allows only text, check boxes and radio buttons. I have tried looking through the documentation for the TreeListCtrl, but was not able to figure out if this could be done, and was hoping to find an answer here.
