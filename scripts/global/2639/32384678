<p>I am creating a wizard dialog with several pages using wxPython. I am having trouble laying out the controls because the size of each page is at least as big as the biggest wizard page. E.g. if my wizard has three pages, and page three has more controls/widgets than the other two, then page two and three have a lot of extra space because the wizard calculates its size based on page 3 (as it's the biggest.) Pages one and two look really sloppy.</p>  <p>I read this in the documentation of the wizard class, which leads me to believe that it's not possible to have a custom page size for each wizard page:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The wizard is laid out using sizers and the page area sizer is the   place-holder for the pages. All pages are resized before being shown   to match the wizard page area.</p>      <p>Page area sizer has a minimal size that is the maximum of several   values. First, all pages (or other objects) added to the sizer.   Second, all pages reachable by repeatedly applying WizardPage.GetNext   to any page inserted into the sizer.</p>      <p>Third, the minimal size specified using SetPageSize and FitToPage .   Fourth, the total wizard height may be increased to accommodate the   bitmap height. Fifth and finally, wizards are never smaller than some   built-in minimal size to avoid wizards that are too small.</p>      <p>The caller can use Sizer.SetMinSize to enlarge it beyond the minimal   size. If RESIZE_BORDER was passed to constructor, user can resize   wizard and consequently the page area (but not make it smaller than   the minimal size).</p>      <p>It is recommended to add the first page to the page area sizer. For   simple wizards, this will enlarge the wizard to fit the biggest page.</p>      <p>For non-linear wizards, the first page of every separate chain should   be added. Caller-specified size can be accomplished using   Sizer.SetMinSize . Adding pages to the page area sizer affects the   default border width around page area that can be altered with   SetBorder .</p> </blockquote>  <p>Does anybody have a solution or workaround that will allow my wizard pages to be sized only according to what is on the current page?</p>
