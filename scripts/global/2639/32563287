<p>I'm making a application with wxPython RichTextCtrl, and I'm currently trying to make bullet points working. I was referencing <a href="http://xoomer.virgilio.it/infinity77/wxPython/richtext/wx.richtext.html" rel="nofollow">this tutorial</a> when writing, but it isn't real-time working application, but instead adds text in code. It looks pretty easy when they do bullet points, but when I try... well this is what I get :</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/HRikU.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/HRikU.png" alt="Bullet Points in rich text control"></a></p>  <p>Here's some of my code:</p>  <pre><code>class RichTextEditor(rt.RichTextCtrl):  def __init__(self, parent):      rt.RichTextCtrl.__init__(self, parent, style=wx.VSCROLL|wx.HSCROLL|wx.NO_BORDER|wx.FONTFAMILY_DEFAULT|wx.TEXT_ATTR_FONT_FACE)       self.Bind(wx.EVT_KEY_DOWN, self.OnKeyDown)     self.BallPoint = 0   def GetHtmlContent(self):      # Get an instance of the html file handler, use it to save the      # document to a StringIO stream. def remove_tags(self, text):     # Clean some unwanted HTML tags  def OnKeyDown(self, evt):      keycode = evt.GetKeyCode()       if evt.ControlDown():          if (keycode == ord('B') ):              self.ApplyBoldToSelection()          elif (keycode == ord('I')):              self.ApplyItalicToSelection()          elif (keycode == ord('U')):              self.ApplyUnderlineToSelection()         elif (keycode == ord('P') and not self.BallPoint):             self.BeginSymbolBullet('*', 100, 60)             self.BallPoint = 1         elif (keycode == ord('P') and self.BallPoint):             self.EndSymbolBullet()             self.BallPoint = 0      evt.Skip() </code></pre>  <p>As you can see, there's not much. Control is in a panel, and panel in a frame and that one is displayed in my app. Screen shows you runtime of my app, text describes my actions. Adding <code>self.EndIntend()</code> wont work as well.</p>  <p>EDIT:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The only thing that I can suggest, short of reporting it as a bug, is changing: </p> </blockquote>  <pre><code>elif (keycode == ord('P') and not self.BallPoint):     self.BeginSymbolBullet('*', 100, 60)     self.BallPoint = 1     </code></pre>  <blockquote>   <p>to:</p> </blockquote>  <pre><code>elif (keycode == ord('P') and not self.BallPoint):     self.BeginSymbolBullet('*', 100, 60)     self.BallPoint = 1     self.Newline()     self.MoveUp(1) </code></pre>  <blockquote>   <p>This adds a line below your bullet which you can access using arrow down.   With this method, whilst very unsatisfactory, you no longer require the >self.EndSymbolBullet() and obviously, you won't need to test BallPoint either.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Work around by <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/4637585/rolf-of-saxony">Rolf of Saxony</a></p>  <p>This is how it works now:<a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/7KUK0.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/7KUK0.png" alt="Bullet Point revised"></a></p>  <p>But you know, it's still not it. I will try to contact the dev team for wxPython, as suggested.</p>  <p>EDIT 2... <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/4637585/rolf-of-saxony">Rolf of Saxony</a>  found a solution... kinda... Here's how it goes <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/QBcru.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/QBcru.png" alt="Kinda working bullet points"></a></p>  <p>And now's the fun part. I know it is not exactly regular thing to do, but if it can happen, then it will. <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5lKQ6.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5lKQ6.png" alt="Strange behaviour"></a></p>  <p>(After first delete there's enter) <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/4637585/rolf-of-saxony">Rolf of Saxony</a> solution does solve partway my problem - I can now get rid of bullet points and intend. But it still behaves in unexpected ways. I will try to find out why and how to avoid this kind of situation.</p>
