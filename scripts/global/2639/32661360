<p>I'm creating an application for capturing the screen or a part of it, and for that I need to select the part of the screen I want to capture.</p>  <p>The idea is to create a fullscreen semi-transparent window and draw thing on it so the user can see what he is doing. I have a working implementation where the selected area is dislayed as a wxPanel, but I want to rewrite it to paint everything to the main wxPanel manually.</p>  <pre><code>frame = new wxFrame(NULL, -1, "", wxPoint(0,0), wxSize(0,0), wxSTAY_ON_TOP|wxFRAME_NO_TASKBAR|wxFRAME_SHAPED);  panel = new wxPanel(frame, -1);  SetTopWindow( frame );  panel-&gt;Bind(wxEVT_KEY_DOWN, &amp;wxMiniApp::OnKeyDown, this); panel-&gt;Bind(wxEVT_KEY_UP, &amp;wxMiniApp::OnKeyUp, this); panel-&gt;Bind(wxEVT_LEFT_DOWN, &amp;wxMiniApp::OnMouseStart, this); panel-&gt;Bind(wxEVT_LEFT_UP, &amp;wxMiniApp::OnMouseEnd, this); panel-&gt;Bind(wxEVT_MOTION, &amp;wxMiniApp::OnMouseMove, this);  panel-&gt;Bind(wxEVT_PAINT, &amp;wxMiniApp::OnPaintPanel, this);  panel-&gt;SetFocus();  panel-&gt;SetBackgroundColour(wxColor(0,0,0,100)); panel-&gt;SetBackgroundStyle(wxBG_STYLE_PAINT);  frame-&gt;SetBackgroundColour(wxColor(0,0,0,0));  frame-&gt;Show();  frame-&gt;ShowFullScreen(true); </code></pre>  <p>I use <code>panel</code> to capture the mouse/keyboard events and I want to do the painting there too, but I don't know how to do this.</p>  <p>I want to have semi-transparent black background and the selected area should be transparent white or even fully transparent (without the black background).</p>  <p>The result of every attempt was that either it draw a solid color background or I got the famous <a href="https://qph.is.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-cd089826a3a628590b714d76bfda5fae" rel="nofollow">WinXP lag effect</a>.</p>  <p>Can you give me a basic <code>OnPaintPanel(wxPaintEvent &amp;event)</code> implementation using <code>x, y, with, height</code> of the selected area (can be in wxPython too, if you're more comfortable with it) ?</p>
