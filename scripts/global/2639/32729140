<p>Recently did an upgrade to my debian distribution to debian jesse</p>  <p>I notice my GUI program which I wrote in wxpython 2.8 was not displaying propery in wxpython3.0</p>  <p>Specifically, the text control box and button was not the same size. To add to this, I attempt to change the size of the mentioned widgets but it remained. the same.</p>  <p>Just to check if I am sane</p>  <p>I created two input box in a frame as follows:</p>  <pre><code>class MyFrame(wx.Frame):     def __init__(self,title, pos, size):         wx.Frame.__init__(self, None, -1, title, pos, size)         self.input_box_search=wx.TextCtrl(self,-1,pos=(90,13),size=(400,80),style=wx.BORDER_NONE)         self.input_box_search1=wx.TextCtrl(self,-1,pos=(90,103),size=(400,40),style=wx.BORDER_NONE) </code></pre>  <p>The two TextCtrl boxes had the same size! the picture below shows how two textctrl boxes of different size are displayed in wxpython3.0</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Zie5W.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Zie5W.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a> Note: using wxpython2.8, each box size displayed correctly.</p>  <p>Any suggestions?</p>
