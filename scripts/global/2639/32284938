<p>So I was looking around at different things to do on Python, like code for flashing text or a timer, but when I copied them into my window, there were constant syntax errors. Now, maybe you're not meant to copy them straight in, but one error I got was 'no module named wx'. I learned that I could get that module by installing wxPython. Problem is, I've tried all 4 options and none of them have worked for me. Which one do I download and how do I set it up?</p>  <p>Thanks,</p>  <p>Oisin </p>
