<p>sorry for my English, but is not my native language.</p>  <p>I made a python script that works like this:</p>  <pre><code>python procesamiento.py Excel1 </code></pre>  <p><code>Excel1</code> is a string to a excel file in a different directory of my script. When I run the script, the result is another excel file, <code>excelprocesado.xls</code>, generated in the directory where the script is. How do I get <code>excelprocesado.xls</code> is generated in the directory where <code>Excel1</code> is? I'm working with wxpython and wxGlade to get the path of <code>Excel1</code></p>  <p>Thanks in advance :)</p>
