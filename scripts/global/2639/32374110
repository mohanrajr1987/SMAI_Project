<p>I have a program that uses the Android adb logcat (which outputs in realtime) which outputs this to a multiline wxpython GUI box. However at the same time, I wish the user to be able to click on the window and use a "search" functionality to search through the output for a string.</p>  <p>I so far have the adb logcat stdout functionality to the progress box working, but when I attempt to click on the window it freezes and crashes, I am guessing this is due to being only able to do 1 thing at a time? </p>  <p>I have read some tutorials and plan to have a go implementing it, however I just wondered if this was the correct idea to achieve my goal?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>  <pre><code>self.progressBox = wx.TextCtrl(panelLog, style=wx.TE_MULTILINE|wx.TE_READONLY)  def logcat(self,e):     stdout = self.parent.deviceExists()     exists = self.parent.exactMatch(stdout, "device")     if "device" in str(exists):         params = [toolsDir + "\\adb.exe", "logcat"]         p = Popen(params, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, bufsize=1)         for line in p.stdout:             self.progressBox.AppendText(line) </code></pre>  <p>P.S if you are a multithreading guru, and wish to give me a hand at implementing it, I won't say no.</p>
