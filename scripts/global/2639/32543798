<p>I'm trying to build a GUI using wxPython.</p>  <p>I have to put a scrollbar in order to user view all information.</p>  <p>In my program I've built 3 panels each panel was then added to a notebook page.</p>  <p>I don't know if it is better to add a scrollbar in each panel or there is a more straightforward way to do that...</p>  <p>After reading all information I have no idea how to deal with  this issue (beginner skills...)</p>  <p>Since the overall program is a little bit complex i will put only small piece of code as an example</p>  <pre><code>class Pan1(wx.Panel):     def __init__(self, parent):         wx.Panel.__init__(self, parent)         self.topBox = wx.BoxSizer(wx.VERTICAL)         fgs = wx.FlexGridSizer(5, 3, 10,0)         #Some lazy buttons and text         fgs2 = wx.FlexGridSizer(1, 4, 10,0)         #Same here         self.topBox.Add(fgs)         self.topBox.Add(fgs2)         self.SetSizer(self.topBox) class MyFrame(wx.Frame):     def __init__(self):         wx.Frame.__init__(self, parent = None, title = "Test", size = (800,600))         self.createMenuBar()         panel = wx.Panel(self)         nb = wx.Notebook(panel)         tab1 = Pan1(nb)         nb.AddPage(tab1, "test tab")         sizer = wx.BoxSizer()         sizer.Add(nb, 1 , wx.EXPAND)         panel.SetSizer(sizer)         self.Show() </code></pre>  <p>Please help me, I've been trying to do that for a while now...</p>  <p>Thanks in advance,</p>
