<p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/wFthk.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/wFthk.png" alt="my app"></a></p>  <p>This is my app and i need to add GLcanvas to the empty panel shown on the image so i can draw graphics there. I want to draw a live graph to the panel. (Yes I've tried matplolib and it's too slow). Can someone give me some example for this please? Is good to use openGL for this type of appication?</p>
