<p>I'm having this issue where no matter what I try, my wxframe with a flexgridsizer can't be refreshed properly. It is updated dynamically, as the user can choose how many combo boxes he/she needs. My script is quite long (about 4000 lines), and I wasn't able to reproduce the issue with a smaller, more manageable piece of code, and that is why I don't post any code. Here are a couple of screenshots depicting my issue:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/JIkBc.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/JIkBc.png" alt="Initial screen"></a></p>  <p>After I refresh the screen, and "roll down" the screen, here's what I get:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/2HPou.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/2HPou.png" alt="After &quot;rolling&quot; the screen:"></a></p>  <p>Note at the top of the screen how the text is on top of the combo box. At this point this text should be gone ("rolled up"). So far what I've tried includes:</p>  <ul> <li>Layout() for the sizers, self, and the panel.</li> <li>A panel refresh followed by an update</li> <li>A panel SetAutoLayout</li> <li>A widget layout going up the parental hierarchy, starting from the static text and combo boxes.</li> </ul>  <p>I went thru the answers for similar questions, and tried those, but no success so far. I run Python 2.7.9, wxPython 3 on Windows 8. </p>  <p>Thank you!</p>
