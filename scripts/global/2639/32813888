<p>So I have a main menu set up with a button that opens a separate options window. It works fine, except for the fact that I can't find a way to keep the value of my spincontrol widget after the menu is closed. This is my current code:</p>  <pre><code> self.spincontrol = wx.SpinCtrl(self.optionmenupanel, value=OtherClass.variable, size=(60,-1)) </code></pre>  <p>On closure of the options menu, this runs:</p>  <pre><code>OtherClass.variable = self.spincontrol.GetValue() str(OtherClass.variable) </code></pre>  <p>The thing is, I get the error:</p>  <pre><code>TypeError: String or Unicode type required </code></pre>  <p>The variable should be a string, I even used <code>str()</code> to make sure. So why is this still happening, and is there a different or better way to do this?</p>
