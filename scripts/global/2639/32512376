<p>I'm using wxPython to build some GUI... Indeed it isn't an easy program...<br> Many many user inputs and outputs to be generated...</p>  <p>One part of the program I put an "Add" button that will dynamically add a TextCtrl field and an "Open" button to open a file. After clicking in the "Open" the user can select a file, the file pathway is therefore showed in the TextCtrl field.</p>  <p>Indeed, using a simple example (one TextCtrl one button) I can handle it...<br> But in a dynamically way, putting several TextCtrl and several Buttons I don't know how to handle it...</p>  <p>In the following code (only a small part of all, some stuff should not be there), I put a "def OpenReadFile" as you can see there after "Open" button click, it will put the text in the last TextCtrl not in the corresponding field... Any ideas?</p>  <p>In another words... Imagine this: Add (the user can Add "n" samples)</p>  <pre><code>"TEXT-1" 'BUTTON-1' "TEXT-2" 'BUTTON-2' "TEXT-3" 'BUTTON-3' </code></pre>  <p>if the user click in button-3 for example it will put the text in Text-3 field (as expected)<br> if the user click in button-2, it will put the text in Text-3...</p>  <p>My code so far (Indeed I know where the mistake is, I just don't know what to d0) =[</p>  <pre><code>self.addButton = wx.Button(self, label="Add Sample") self.Bind(wx.EVT_BUTTON, self.OnAddWidget, self.addButton) def OnAddWidget(self, event):     self.samplenumber += 1     self.sampleTextCtrl = wx.TextCtrl(self, wx.NewId(), "", size = (200,-1))     self.buttonF = wx.Button(self, buttonId, label = "Select File") #Add Open File Button     self.Bind(wx.EVT_BUTTON, self.OpenReadFile, self.buttonF) #Add click event     self.fgs4.Add(self.buttonF, proportion = 1, flag = wx.CENTER, border = -1) def OpenReadFile(self,event):     dlg = wx.FileDialog(self, "Open File",                 os.getcwd(), style = wx.OPEN)      if dlg.ShowModal() == wx.ID_OK:         self.filename = dlg.GetPath()         self.sampleTextCtrl.SetValue(self.filename) </code></pre>  <p>I'm pretty sure that I do have to do some stuff in OpenReadFile =]</p>  <p><strong>EDITED</strong></p>  <p>I've put a dict before, got the button ID and the TextCtrl put it in the dict and done.  </p>  <pre><code>my_dict = {} self.sampleTextCtrl = wx.TextCtrl(self, wx.NewId(), "", size = (200,-1)) value = self.sampleTextCtrl buttonId = wx.NewId() self.buttonF = wx.Button(self, buttonId, label = "Select File")  mydict[buttonId] = value </code></pre>  <p>Done</p>
