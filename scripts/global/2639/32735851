<p>I think I got a big problem with deleting items from dataViewListCtrl in wxPython. I have a dataViewListCtrl with several rows. The user can mark and delete the rows. To get the selection I use the method GetSelections() from the dataViewListCtrl like:</p>  <pre><code>def delSektion(self, event):     tmpo = self.frame.m_dvlc.GetSelections()     for i in tmpo:         print "test" </code></pre>  <p>So I get a list of DataViewItems. To identify this items I use the method getID() from the DataViewItem. With this id I can delete the rows in the DataViewListCtrl with the method DeleteItem().</p>  <p><strong>And now the problem:</strong></p>  <p>If the user did this several times the index of the rows in DataViewListCtrl changed. But the ItemID is still the same so I have no connections between the ItemID of the DataViewItem and the RowID of the DataViewListCtrl.</p>  <p>I hope you understand what I mean and my horrible English - sorry!</p>  <p>Thanks!!</p>
