<p>I am writing up a rudimentary Intinerary Manager. Just a simple side-project to familiarize myself with using wxPython to create GUIs. This is my first attempt, and I can't seem to find any reference to this problem anywhere else.</p>  <p>My code is as follows:</p>  <pre><code>import wx  class mainWindow(wx.Frame):     def __init__(self, parent, title):         wx.Frame.__init__(self, parent, title=title, size=(650, 1000))          panel = wx.Panel(self)          vbox = wx.BoxSizer(wx.VERTICAL)          topLabel = wx.StaticText(panel, size = (-1, -1), label="Itinerary")          vbox.Add(topLabel, 1, wx.EXPAND)          self.listBox = wx.ListCtrl(panel, style = wx.LC_LIST)         self.listBox.InsertColumn(0, "Test Column")         self.listBox.Append(["This is an item"])         self.listBox.Append(["This is another item"])          vbox.Add(self.listBox, 1, wx.EXPAND | wx.ALL, 20)          panel.SetSizer(vbox)          self.Show(True)    app = wx.App(False) frame = mainWindow(None, "Itinerary Manager")  app.MainLoop() </code></pre>  <p>For some reason, this is resulting in an enormous margin between the StaticText element at the top and the ListCtrl below it. I've tried a few workarounds, including setting the parent of each to self, but that gives the same output. What can I do to make sure that these 2 controls have no (or very small) margins between one another?</p>
