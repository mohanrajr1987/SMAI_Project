<p>I'm creating a screenshot application using wxWidgets, and want to achieve something similar to this: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17460541/how-can-i-select-an-area-on-the-screen-and-dim-the-unseleceted-area-with-python">How can I select an area on the screen and dim the unseleceted area with Python?</a></p>  <p>I don't understand how can I draw the four rectangles around the selected area and left the selected area transparent. If I move the mouse and the selected area changes, the result of the previous painting will stay there, and I can't find a way to remove it, only to redraw everything with a solid color.</p>
