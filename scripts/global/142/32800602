<p>I'm running ant script (build.xml) which specifies JDK path that is on server: (WebLogic 10.3.6 which is using jdk 1.6.0.3.) But facing below error:</p>  <pre><code>[wlcompile] [JAM] Error: Value of annotation member type is of an unexpected type: class com.sun.tools.javadoc.ParameterizedTypeImpl   [javax.xml.bind.JAXBElement] </code></pre>  <p>Can someone suggest just what may be the problem?</p>
