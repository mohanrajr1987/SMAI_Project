<p>I'm new in the ant world and have run into an issue involving the missing tools.jar file when I perform the ant -version command from a cmd prompt.  I've reviewed most of the other postings and have not found a solution. I have installed jdk-8u60-windows-i586, and apache-ant-1.9.6. (the installations were done in this order) The Path includes both ANT_HOME and JAVA_HOME variables ANT_HOME is set to the location folder where apache-ant is located JAVA_HOME is set to the location folder where the jdk is installed I've run a system scan for tools.jar and was unable to locate it</p>
