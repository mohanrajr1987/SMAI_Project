<p><a href="https://ant.apache.org/manual/Tasks/echo.html" rel="nofollow">Echo tasks</a> have a logging level associated with them, and I've been able to use this to turn off certain debug messages by default, like echoing the <code>CLASSPATH</code> before every build.</p>  <p>That's great, except now I don't know how to get the debug messages to show up at all, via a command-line argument. Everything I've read refers to this, so it must be possible to set the log level, but I've no idea how to set it. Thanks!</p>  <p>I'm sure this is a simple thing I must have missed in the documentation, but a quite a few <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=ant+change+log+level+command+line" rel="nofollow">likely</a> search queries returned no relevant results. A method to do this via Eclipse or IntelliJ would probably also be relevant.</p>  <p>Ant has several command line options for controlling its own verbosity (<code>-quiet</code>, <code>-verbose</code>), but these do not appear to correspond to log levels for <code>&lt;echo&gt;</code> tasks, and certainly cannot map to all possible log levels.</p>  <p>I see also that you can set the log level <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/5465088/712526">from within the build file</a>, but that's not what I need.</p>
