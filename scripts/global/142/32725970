<p>I wrote an ant org.apache.tools.ant.BuildListener that does stuff if the build fails. I can use it  from the command line with <code>ant -listener org.smottguyz.antlisteners.SimpleListener build_all</code>. But when I use the NetBeans IDE, there is no apparent way to specify a <code>-listener</code> option.</p>  <p>Is there a way to specify an additional build listener with ant (or NetBeans) properties, settings or configuration somewhere?</p>  <p>EDIT. It turns out this is pretty NetBeans specific, because, for whatever reason, NetBeans disables most of the approaches that work for most ant configurations. So <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5721513/is-it-possible-to-specify-logger-for-ant-inside-build-xml">Is it possible to specify logger for ant inside build.xml?</a> is relevant, but not an answer :(</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
