<p>I am using <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/rcptt/" rel="nofollow">RCPTT</a> to test my RCP product.</p>  <p>I copied the sample <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/rcptt/documentation/userguide/runner/runner.cmd" rel="nofollow">cmd</a> and <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/rcptt/documentation/userguide/runner/build.xml" rel="nofollow">Ant</a> files to run my tests with my AUT, replacing the variables to point to the same locations. When I run it with my bat file, the test runs beautifully. However, when I run it using Ant, I get a log file full of "BundleException: Could not resolve module" exceptions.</p>  <p>Is this a common problem? How do I fix it?</p>
