<p>I have a <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file which I want to make by using ant script. Is there a way to give commands for <code>cmake .</code> and <code>make</code> through ant? I used to have a MakeFile and I had the following command to make it:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;project name="sampleProject" default="make"&gt;      &lt;target name="make"&gt;         &lt;exec executable="make" failonerror="true"&gt;             &lt;arg line="-f Makefile"/&gt;         &lt;/exec&gt;     &lt;/target&gt; &lt;/project&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Is it somehow similar to this? Does anyone know how to do it? I am looking for an alternative to <a href="https://code.google.com/p/cmakeant/" rel="nofollow">cmakeant</a></p>
