<p>I am able to create a fileset which includes certain directories. I am including this fileset to a copy. I want to take the child file and copy it without taking the parent folder.</p>  <p>My source structure is:</p>  <p>root</p>  <ul> <li><p>Folder1</p>  <ul> <li>Folder2  <ul> <li>script.js</li> </ul></li> <li>Folder3  <ul> <li>script2.js</li> </ul></li> </ul>  <p>      </p></li> </ul>  <p>So I want script.js and script2.js copied, but in the destination directory I get Folder2 and Folder3 included.</p>  <p>I'm out of depth. Help would be appreciated.</p>
