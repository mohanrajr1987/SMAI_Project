<p>I'm at a loss at what's wrong. I have an Ant build.xml that has the line</p>  <pre><code>&lt;path id="maven-ant-tasks.classpath" path="lib/maven-ant-tasks-2.1.3.jar" /&gt; </code></pre>  <p>and then later </p>  <pre><code>&lt;target name="clean"&gt; &lt;artifact:mvn pom="${basedir}/pom.xml"&gt;   &lt;arg value="clean"/&gt; &lt;/artifact:mvn&gt; </code></pre>  <p></p>  <p>The error I get is</p>  <pre><code>java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.apache.maven.artifact.ant.DependenciesTask.setPathType(Ljava/lang/String;)V </code></pre>  <p>The .jar file exists in the Ant's lib/ folder, and it also contains said function (unzipped it and looked at .class file). Also, when I change the path in the "path=" attribute, it doesn't complain, which means it's not even looking!</p>  <p>Anyone have an idea why it's not even considering the "path=" element here? Strangely enough, for other people in my group it works, and it has for me too in the past (had to rebuild my machine and reinstall everything).</p>
