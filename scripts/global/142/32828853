<p>Need help with Selenium Webdriver script and Jenkins. Jenkins is already setup and working. I have created a Java Class in Intellij with Selenium Webdiver commands. Not sure how to integrate it with Jenkins. I went thru some articles and not sure where to start. I tried generating ANT build using Intellij but could not get it to work in Jenkins. </p>  <p>Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!</p>
