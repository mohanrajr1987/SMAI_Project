<p>I am trying to create a rectangle on a picturebox with randome size and location.  Every time the user click on a button, the rectangle will be removed and the new one will be displayed.</p>  <pre><code>Private Sub btnDraw_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnDraw.Click   RandomBox() End Sub  Public Sub RandomBox()   Dim r As New Rectangle(CInt(Rnd() * picGene.Width), CInt(Rnd() * picGene.Height), 20 + Rnd() * 50, 10 + Rnd() * 50)   Dim g As System.Drawing.Graphics   g = picGene.CreateGraphics()   g.FillRectangle(Brushes.Blue, r) End Sub </code></pre>  <p>It always keeps the rectangles drawn previously so I tried to place the picGene.Invalide() before or after the code block. It removes the old rectangle but it does not draw the new rectangle.</p>  <pre><code>Public Sub RandomBox()   picGene.Invalidate()   Dim r As New Rectangle(CInt(Rnd() * picGene.Width), CInt(Rnd() * picGene.Height), 20 + Rnd() * 50, 10 + Rnd() * 50)   Dim g As System.Drawing.Graphics   g = picGene.CreateGraphics()   g.FillRectangle(Brushes.Blue, r)   'picGene.Invalidate() End Sub </code></pre>  <p>Any idea?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
