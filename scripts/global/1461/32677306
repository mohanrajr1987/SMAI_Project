<p>I want to draw a vertical line for all the child items in a group of an ExpandableListView. My child item is a <code>TextView</code>, so I tried to draw a vertical line in every child <code>TextView</code>, like this:</p>  <pre><code>    @Override     protected void onDraw(Canvas canvas) {         super.onDraw(canvas);         canvas.drawLine(25, 0, 25, getHeight(), mPaint);     } </code></pre>  <p>But there was a small space between every adjacent items, so the lines of items did not combine into one single line. Just like the items below:</p>  <pre><code>group 1 | child 1 | child 2 | child 3 | child 4 group 2 | child 1 | child 2 </code></pre>  <p>How can I draw a single line instead?</p>
