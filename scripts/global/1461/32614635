<p>I'm currently reproducing this svg effect : when you scroll the page, a word is drawing itself.  You can observe it here : <a href="http://bit.ly/1iP7svJ" rel="nofollow">http://bit.ly/1iP7svJ</a></p>  <p>I'd like to wait until the user has reach a part of the page before starting drawing, but I don't know how to do that. I tried with  <code>if ( $(window).scrollTop() &gt;= 1000 ) {</code>  but the word appears already draw with this method. Anyone have an idea ?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
