<p>I am trying to optimize some code that uses the canvas.drawImage() call.  This is a pretty expensive call when called several hundreds or thousands of times.  Found out about the canvas.toBlob(callback) method but I want to know if there is a way to get only a section of the canvas. </p>  <p>drawimage() gives much more fine grain control over which sections should be draw.</p>  <pre><code>canvas.drawImage(canvas, sx, sy, sw, sh, dx, dy, dw, dh); </code></pre>  <p>Any suggestions / thoughts are welcomed! </p>
