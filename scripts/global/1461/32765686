<p>I just started with GDI - the first line was ok - but the second.... I want to draw a simple diagonal line from (0,0) to (MaxWidth,MaxHeight) Here my Code:</p>  <pre><code>Public Class Form1 Dim g As Graphics = Me.CreateGraphics Dim stift As New Pen(Brushes.Black, 3) Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click     Dim x1 = 0, y1 = 0, x2 = Me.Size.Width, y2 = Me.Size.Height     g.DrawLine(stift, x1, y1, x2, y2)  End Sub </code></pre>  <p>End Class</p>  <p>But the line ends at the MaxWidth and MaxHeight of the first unchanged form. Anybody any idea? Thanks a lot for help.</p>  <p>CS</p>
