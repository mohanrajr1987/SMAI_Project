<p>I have created a jpanel with paintcomponent and i have a scribblePane which has draw functionality, i want the jpanel component to overwrite my scribblePane. my jpanel paintcomponent code is:</p>  <pre><code>JPanel panel = new JPanel() {                     @Override                     public void paintComponent(Graphics g) {                         super.paintComponent(g);                         //g.setColor(Color.BLUE);                         //g.fillRect(0, 0, 100, 100);                         circle.draw(g);                     }                 };                 scribblePane.add(panel);                  frame.validate(); // because you added panel after setVisible was called                 frame.repaint(); // because you added panel after setVisible was called  frame.getContentPane().add(scribblePane, BorderLayout.CENTER); </code></pre>  <p>How to do it?
