<p>When using WPF, you can draw StrokeDashArrays using <code>StrokeDashArray="1,10,5,5"</code> etc.</p>  <p>However, I am using the StrokeDashArray-Property on a ellipse shape and I do not want to calculate all double values when drawing this ellipse.</p>  <p>Is it possible to somehow use percentage values?<br/> Something like <code>StrokeDashArray="10%, 50%, 25%, 15%"</code>...</p>  <p><hr/> <strong>EDIT:</strong> I forgot to append my definition of <code>percentage</code> in this context: The percentage of the complete line.</p>  <p>e.g.:<br/>If you have a circle/ellipse with a radius of 100px, the circumference would be <code>2π * 100</code> and the value <code>10%</code> would be <code>2π * 100px * 0.1 = 62.8px</code>. These 62.8px should be the length of the corresponding segment, which is represented by the 10%</p>
