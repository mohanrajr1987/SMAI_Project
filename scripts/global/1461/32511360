<p>I am drawing circles on SurfaceView on its OnTouch event. Here is the code</p>  <pre><code>public class DrawableSurface extends SurfaceView {     public DrawableSurface(Context context) {         super(context);         surfaceHolder = getHolder();         paint.setColor(Color.RED);         paint.setStyle(Paint.Style.FILL);          /*Handler handler = new Handler();         handler.postDelayed(new Bubbles(handler) ,1000);*/     }      private final SurfaceHolder surfaceHolder;     private final Paint paint = new Paint(Paint.ANTI_ALIAS_FLAG);        @Override     public boolean onTouchEvent(MotionEvent event) {          if (event.getAction() == MotionEvent.ACTION_MOVE)         {             Canvas canvas = surfaceHolder.lockCanvas();              canvas.drawCircle(event.getX(), event.getY(), 50, paint);             surfaceHolder.unlockCanvasAndPost(canvas);         }         return true;     } } </code></pre>  <p>Whenever a new shape is drawn some of the already drawn shapes disappear. Not all of them, but some of them disappear. And sometimes they appear back. I couldn't figure it out. Why would it be happening?</p>
