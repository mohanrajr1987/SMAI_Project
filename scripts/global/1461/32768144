<p>I have a function for drawing lines, edited below. It seems to work fine in the simulator, however there are performance issues, lines drawn slowly, when running on both an older iPhone (2011) and a newer iPad (2014). I believe this issue is due to creating a new <strong>CGContext</strong> for every <strong>touchesMoved</strong> event received.</p>  <p>How can I, for example, call <strong>let context = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext()</strong> once when <strong>touchesBegan</strong>? (i.e. how can I make <strong>context</strong> a public variable that can be called once?)</p>  <p>Any other tips for improving the performance would be appreciated. Thank you.</p>  <pre><code>override func touchesMoved(touches: NSSet, withEvent event: UIEvent) {      autoreleasepool {      UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptions(view.frame.size, false, 0.0)      let context = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext()      ...     ...     ...      UIGraphicsEndImageContext()      }  } </code></pre>
