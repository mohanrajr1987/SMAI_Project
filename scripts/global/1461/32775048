<p>I'm trying to create an interactive map using minimalistic HTML, CSS and JavaScript; trying not to use frameworks to maintain a low kb size.  I've done it using SVG and also drawing with HTML canvas.  Is there another way?  Or maybe a method I haven't heard of? I want to create a simple map of the US states for mouse over and outs, all under 100kb, preferably 50kb. Anyone have any ideas or know some tricks? Thanks,</p>
