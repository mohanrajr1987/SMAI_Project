<p>I've just started learning app developing and I've encountered a problem. Every where I looked (maybe because I don't know what to search) I'm just seeing examples of how to draw drawables or bitmap and always you have to give boundaries, but then its draws the picture inside a little white rectangle. I would like to draw something exactly how it supposed to appear. How can I do it? How can I make the image so it won't be inside a rectangle too? What tools do I need to use? </p>
