<p>let's say I have a canvas with a point at coords [0,0] (in pixels probably) and I want to move the point to [0,200] in a specific timeframe (5s eg) at a constant/accelerating speed. Is there a function for that? </p>  <p>I can't just Point.set(X,Y). I know I probably have to use a loop but I have never worked with a loop that can run every let's say 0.05s and redraw it. </p>  <p>Is there some delay function for the loop? I can easily calculated the coords where the point will be at time T but I have no idea how to prevent it finishing in an instant. </p>  <p>I basically want to create an animation in canvas but pretty customizable considering not constant speed etc.</p>  <p>Thank you for your responses. If something is not clear, I'll gladly explain it.</p>
