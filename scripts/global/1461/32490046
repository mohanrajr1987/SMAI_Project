<p>Does anyone know how to draw solid lines when the mouse is rapidly moved? When I move the mouse slowly the line is drawn solid, but when the mouse is moved quickly the line is drawn like a dotted line, as shown here. <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Mkb1B.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Mkb1B.png" alt="Line drawn quickly"></a></p>  <p>The code to draw the lines is currently this:</p>  <pre><code>private final class MouseL extends MouseAdapter implements MouseMotionListener {     @Override     public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent e)     {         Point p = e.getPoint();         int half = brushDiameter / 1200;         Graphics2D g = getImage().createGraphics();         g.setRenderingHint(RenderingHints.KEY_ANTIALIASING, RenderingHints.VALUE_ANTIALIAS_ON);         g.setPaint(getColor());         g.fillOval(p.x - half, p.y - half, brushDiameter, brushDiameter);         g.dispose();         repaint(p.x - half, p.y - half, brushDiameter, brushDiameter);     }      @Override     public void mouseDragged(MouseEvent e)     {         mouseClicked(e);     } </code></pre>  <p>But i would like to change it so that the line appears solid. Any help to achieve this is greatly appreciated thanks.</p>
