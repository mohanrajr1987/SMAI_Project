<p>I have a form that contains a picture box.  In the code-behind, I draw some things in this picture box.  The size of these drawings depend on the size of the picture box (for example, a circle whose width is 90% of the box's width).  When the form loads, it is in normal state, and it looks fine.  I can maximize the form, and when I do the controls size accordingly and the drawings in the picture box also size accordingly - so that all looks good.  The issue is when I then restore the form back to a normal state:  the controls resize accordingly, but the drawings in the picture box do not (therefore some of it is cut off because it's too large).  I tried using the Me.Resize event to call the logic that makes the drawings, but for some reason when that is called it still thinks the width of the picture box is the width when in the maximized state.</p>  <p>So why do the graphics in the picture box resize fine when you maximize the form, but not when you restore it to normal?</p>  <p>And why would it still think the box's width is that while maximized, not actually the width when normal which is the state it's now in?</p>  <p>Is there a way to get around this so I can make sure the graphics will resize correctly?</p>  <p>Note:  I would try using the ResizeEnd event instead, but that is not raised when you maximize or restore the form.  I don't know why that is, either.</p>
