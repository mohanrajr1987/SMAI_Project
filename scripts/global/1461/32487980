<p>I have the video playback functionality in my iOS App. The video stream comes from Internet. Every time the App receives a frame from the socket, it converts the data from Char * to an UIImage and display it in a UIImageView. </p>  <p>I am thinking that this is not very efficient because the App release and retain memory for each video frame. Just wondering if there is any more efficient way to update the UI, say, without creating an UIImage for each video frame.</p>  <p>Any suggestion is highly appreciated.  </p>
