<p>i have to develop a website where user comes and have some area for free drawing.</p>  <p>like some sketch and then save the image on server. so I chooses canvas.. since we can easily draw line, points based on mouse (x,y) changes</p>  <p>But problem came when tested on mobile browser like samsung galaxy tab, e.g., using its pen; canvas is not editable. seems like mouse down doesn't trigger.</p>  <p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false"> <div class="snippet-code"> <pre class="snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>ctx = document.getElementById('myCanvas').getContext("2d"); $('#myCanvas').mousedown();</code></pre> </div> </div> </p>  <p>or any other javascript api for free drawing that works for both desktop and mobile will be appreciated.</p>
