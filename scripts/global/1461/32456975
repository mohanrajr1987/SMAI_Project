<p>I need to draw several circles from smaller to larger radius on canvas because it need to be updated regularly. I tried with drawing a circle first but the circle is looks like more oval. I need perfect circle. Also how can I get height and width of that Linearlayout dynamically so that I can place the circle at center screen.</p>  <p>Code is given here...</p>  <pre><code>@Override protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {         super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);         setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);         LinearLayout ll = (LinearLayout) findViewById(R.id.drawCanvas);         Paint paint = new Paint(Paint.ANTI_ALIAS_FLAG);         paint.setColor(Color.parseColor("#CD5C5C"));         paint.setStyle(Paint.Style.STROKE);         paint.setStrokeWidth(4);         Bitmap bm = Bitmap.createBitmap(480,800,Bitmap.Config.ARGB_8888);         Canvas canvas = new Canvas(bm);         canvas.drawCircle(240, 400, 100, paint);         ll.setBackgroundDrawable(new BitmapDrawable(bm));     } </code></pre>  <p>I am testing on real device with Android version 3.1 (API 12). Pls help.</p>
