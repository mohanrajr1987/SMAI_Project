<p>I am working on a drawing application. I need to plot individual items/UIView inside a rectangle area. I was able to capture the four individual nodes <em>(x1,y1),(x2,y2),(x3,y3)</em> and <em>(x4,y4)</em> of the rectangle which can in any formation. There I need to add multiples item inside that rectangle area like the attached image.<a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Icya0.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Icya0.png" alt="enter image description here"></a>.</p>
