<p>I am trying to build a screensaver for osx to get familiar with the Cocoa-Drawing-System. I am actually wondering if it is ok to perform asynchronous network requests. Can I just call <code>[NSURLSession downloadTaskWithURL:]</code> in the screensaver or is there a better way to download the images from the internet? The screensaver should first download the images from the internet,cache them and display them. As soon as the images are ready to use, the NSScreenSaverView gets notified as the delegate of the class that downloads the images.</p>
