<p>I am drawing ink annotation in pdf using objective-c. Pdf specifications say that we need to provide an array of points for the ink drawing. I am using <strong>PoDoFo</strong> library. </p>  <p>This is how I am drawing ink annotation currently:</p>  <pre><code>PoDoFo::PdfArray arr; //This is the array of points to be drawn  arr.push_back(X1); arr.push_back(Y1); arr.push_back(X2); arr.push_back(Y2); arr.push_back(X3); arr.push_back(Y3);  .  .  . arr.push_back(Xn-1); arr.push_back(Yn-1); arr.push_back(Xn); arr.push_back(Yn);  PoDoFo::PdfMemDocument* doc = (PoDoFo::PdfMemDocument *)aDoc;  PoDoFo::PdfPage* pPage = doc-&gt;GetPage(pageIndex); //PageIndex is page number if (! pPage) {     // couldn't get that page     return; } PoDoFo::PdfAnnotation* anno; PoDoFo::EPdfAnnotation type= PoDoFo::ePdfAnnotation_Ink;  PoDoFo::PdfRect rect; rect.SetBottom(aRect.origin.y); rect.SetLeft(aRect.origin.x); rect.SetHeight(aRect.size.height); rect.SetWidth(aRect.size.width);  //aRect is CGRect where annotation is to be drawn on page  anno = pPage-&gt;CreateAnnotation(type , rect); anno-&gt;GetObject()-&gt;GetDictionary().AddKey("InkList", arr); </code></pre>  <p>The problem is that how do I make an array which covers every point. I am getting points from touches delegate methods (e.g. TouchesMoved), but when user draw with high <em>velocity</em> then some points/pixels are skipped and pdf just can’t interpolate those skipped points for itself. Bezier curves can interpolate and draw smooth curves but <em>Bezier-curve</em> don’t provide me the array of all the points (including skipped one) and I need such an array so that when the pdf is opened in adobe reader, it shows smooth curves. Right now I get smooth curve in any iOS device but the curve isn’t smooth on adobe reader. Here is the comparison of curves, one drawn using <em>Bezier-curves</em> in simulator and other in adobe reader. </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/v3Ftr.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/v3Ftr.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Above picture is taken from iPad simulator which is drawn using Bezier curve and is smooth.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/F8Rml.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/F8Rml.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Above picture is taken from adobe reader. You can see the red curve isn’t smooth like the blue one. How do I make it smooth?</p>
