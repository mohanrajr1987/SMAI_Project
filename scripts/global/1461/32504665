<p>I have 3 vectors, each one includes ( for example ) 300 integer, how can i draw these vectors to get one 3D figure with true Dimensions and allow user to render ( rotate ) this 3D figure ?</p>  <p>In other words, i want something equivalent to 'plot3d' function in Matlab.</p>  <p>the final figure i want is something like this picture <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/qdRZB.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/qdRZB.png" alt="enter image description here"></a>.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p>
