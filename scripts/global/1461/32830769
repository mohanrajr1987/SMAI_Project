<p>I was making a basic paint/draw program in processing where the Left click would draw a point and a Right click would draw a background colored rectangle to "erase". The thing is that when I start erasing it wont let me go back to drawing. Also i would like to make the dots draw faster so it looks more like a line rather than a dotted line. Thanks! Here is the code:</p>  <pre><code>void setup() {   size(600, 600);   background(#C4C4C4); }  void draw() {   frameRate(60);   if (mouseButton == LEFT) {     fill(#030303);     point(mouseX, mouseY);   }    else if(mouseButton == RIGHT){     fill(#C4C4C4);     noStroke();     rect(mouseX-15, mouseY-15, 30, 30);   } } </code></pre>
