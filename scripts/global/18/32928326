<p>I want to use sed to split a text into bigrams (sets of two adjacent words). I'm using the following command: </p>  <pre><code>sed -r 's/(\\w+) (\\w+)/\\1 \\2\\n/g' input.txt &gt;output.txt </code></pre>  <p>The problem is that sed splits the input after every second word with a new line, and continues <strong>after</strong> that sequence (i.e. at the third word). I want it to take the second word as the next starting point.</p>  <p>Example: </p>  <pre><code>the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog </code></pre>  <p>results in:</p>  <pre><code>the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy </code></pre>  <p>What I want is:</p>  <pre><code>the quick quick brown brown fox fox jumped jumped over over the the lazy lazy dog </code></pre>  <p>I guess I could run another sed command by deleting the first word of the original input. But is there a way to get the desired result in one command? </p>
