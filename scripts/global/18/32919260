<p>i have this script:</p>  <pre><code>            foreach (Match m in Regex.Matches(downloadString, "window.location\\s*=\\s*\\(\"(.*?)\"\\);"))             {                 console.Text += m.Value + "\n";             } </code></pre>  <p>It works, but with only one result, I want what is in (.*?), in PHP it should be index 1 in array, but here I have only one item in array.</p>  <p>What is wrong?</p>
