<p>Hello im very new to java and im currently taking a introduction to programming class using java. Im having trouble finding the specific position of a character. the entry is suppose to be all numbers and if there is a letter, its suppose to tell what position the letter is located. also i cannot use Loops for this assignment. This is the best result that i have gotten so far but it only works if the entry has an x. how can i make it to show the position of any letter in the alphabet? im sorry if i sound stupid but im very very new to java. thanks in advance.</p>  <pre><code>String alphabet = "x"; if (!isbn.matches("[0-9]+")) {         System.out.println("You need to enter a numeric digit at position " + isbn.indexOf(alphabet)); </code></pre>
