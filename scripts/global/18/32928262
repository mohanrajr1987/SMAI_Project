<p>I was playing around with regular expressions in JS for the first time, and I tried for a long time to do something like this with a regex literal, the page would not load and eventually crash:</p>  <pre><code>var string = "12453828378123898728912382123833"; var match; while(match = /123(\d)/g.exec(string)) {     console.log(match[1]); } </code></pre>  <p>However, if I put the literal in a variable, then it worked just fine:</p>  <pre><code>var string = "12453828378123898728912382123833"; var match; var regex = /123(\d)/g; while(match = regex.exec(string)) {     console.log(match[1]); } </code></pre>  <p>Output:</p>  <pre><code>8 8 8 </code></pre>  <p>Why does this happen? I'm a bit of a JS newbie, and I don't really need to know, but I'm curious.</p>
