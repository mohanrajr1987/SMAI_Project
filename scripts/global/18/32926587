<p>I have to find all strings which are made of only letters 'a' and 'b' and every instance of 'a' is immediately followed by 'b' and immediately preceded by 'b'.</p>  <p>For example:</p>  <pre><code>mystring = 'bab babab babbab ab baba aba xyz' </code></pre>  <p>Then my regex should return:</p>  <pre><code>['bab' 'babab' 'babbab']   </code></pre>  <p>(In string 'ab' - 'a' is not preceded by 'b'. Similarly for 'aba' and 'xyz' is not made of only 'a','b'.)</p>  <p>I used lookahead for this and wrote this regex:</p>  <pre><code>re.findall(r'((?&lt;=b)a(?=b))',mystring) </code></pre>  <p>But this only returns me all instances of 'a' which are followed/preceded by 'b' like:</p>  <pre><code>['a','a','a','a'] </code></pre>  <p>But I need whole words. How can I find whole words using regex? I tried to modify my regex with various options, but nothing seems to work. How can this be done?</p>
