<p>I have a list of tokens in a text file and want to use grep to get the lines from a second text file that contain those tokens, but seem to be having trouble accessing the shell variable with grep:</p>  <pre><code>for n in `cat ./pos/1.txt` do cat dictionary.txt | grep "$n" done </code></pre>  <p>I've tried $n, "$n", ${n}, "${n}", ^${n}, and "^${n}" None of them seem to work.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
