<p>I am currently learning how to write regular expressions in Java by trying to match simple Hashtag pattern. The Hashtags obey the following conditions:</p>  <ol> <li>It starts with a hashtag</li> <li>It needs to contain at least 1 letter</li> <li>It can contain any of the characters from from the [a-zA-Z0-9_]</li> <li>It cannot be preceded by a character of the class [a-zA-Z0-9_]</li> </ol>  <p>Based on this, I would have thought that the correct regular expression is:</p>  <pre><code>PATTERN = "(?&lt;![a-zA-Z0-9_])#(?=.*[a-zA-Z])[a-zA-Z0-9_]+" </code></pre>  <p>Here I'm using a lookahead <code>(?=.*[a-zA-Z])</code> to make sure Condition 3 holds and using a lookbehind <code>(?&lt;![a-zA-Z0-9_])</code> to make sure Condition 4 holds. I'm less certain about ending with a <code>+</code>.</p>  <p>This works on simple test cases but fails on complicated ones such as:</p>  <pre><code>String text = "####THIS_IS_A_HASHTAG;;;#This_1_2...#12_and_this "; </code></pre>  <p>where  it cannot match <code>#THIS_IS_A_HASHTAG</code>, <code>#This_1_2</code> and <code>12_and_this</code></p>  <p>Could someone explain what I'm doing wrong?</p>
