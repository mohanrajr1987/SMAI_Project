<p>Looking for a ruby regex to match these conditions:</p>  <ul> <li>Only lowercase letters, numbers, and dashes</li> <li>At least one letter</li> <li>Does not start or end with a dash</li> </ul>  <p>Edit: Wow, 5 downvotes instantly. I don't know how I could make this any more simple. I need a regex that will allow strings to pass with those conditions. Very easy to understand what I said. What is wrong with you people?</p>  <p>So for example:</p>  <p>aAaaa - (fail, capital)</p>  <p>33994 - (fail, no letter)</p>  <p>333_3423 - (fail, contains an underscore)</p>  <p>-aaa  - (fail, starts with a dash)</p>  <p>aaa-  - (fail starts with a dash)</p>  <p>aa8-d (SUCCESS)</p>  <p>aabsdg323-sdf (SUCCESS)</p>  <p>so on and so forth.</p>  <p>Again, really simple, don't understand the hate.</p>
