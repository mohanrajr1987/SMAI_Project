<p>I'm using MediaEmbed (<a href="https://github.com/dereuromark/MediaEmbed" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/dereuromark/MediaEmbed</a>) to convert any media URLs in a string to their respective embed code, but it's also catching media URLs within iframes (already embedded).</p>  <p>The expression I'm using to match links is:</p>  <pre><code>"~[[:alpha:]]+://[^&lt;&gt;[:space:]]+[[:alnum:]/]~" </code></pre>  <p>What would this need to be changed to in order for it to not match if the URL is within an iframe?</p>
