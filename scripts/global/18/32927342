<p>I'm having trouble web scraping US street addresses without the use of programming languages but using Chrome/Firefox extension for an assignment.</p>  <p>Say the Yelp! page has:</p>  <p>1032 S Fairfax Ave Los Angeles, CA 90019</p>  <p>I would like to match just the '1032 S Fairfax Ave' part, not the city, state or zipcode. I could use <code>(\d{1,5}\s\w+\s?\w+?\s?Ave)</code> but it would not work if a street name is '984 N Broadway' or any other streets without any Blvd or Rd or Ct. That I could use <code>(\d{1,5}\s\w+\s?\w+way)</code>.</p>  <p>Is there a more complex regular expression that can capture both kinds of street addresses? I couldn't find any after nights of searching and tinkering.</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
