<p>I looked through various posts but could not find a solution to my problem.</p>  <p>I have a query string that has elements that looks like </p>  <pre><code>location IN ('Place A',  'Place B')  </code></pre>  <p>and sometimes I need to have it look like</p>  <pre><code>location IN ('Place A', 'Place B') and person IN ('Security', 'HR') </code></pre>  <p>I would like to be able to replace the " <strong>),</strong> " after Place B with " <strong>) and</strong> " so I can concatenate my query.  Sometimes I have several 'and' statements so this has to be (I guess) a global or '/g' switched replace statement.</p>  <p>I have tried</p>  <pre><code>new_filter_string.replace(/[),]/g, ') and '); </code></pre>  <p>but I get back a query that has removed parens and commas that should stay.  I am just looking to replace that very specific parens/comma string for ALL instances of it.</p>  <p>Thanks for your help with this, in advance.</p>
