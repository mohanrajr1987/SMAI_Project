<p>How do I extract the text inside the brackets using regex? For example if I have </p>  <p><strong>string = 'This is a test code [asdf -wer -a2 asdf] (ascd asdfas -were)'</strong></p>  <p>I want output to be </p>  <p><strong>[asdf-wer-a2-asdf], (ascd asdfas -were)</strong></p>  <p>I have looked everywhere for this and haven't been able to solve this problem.  If anyone can help me that would be great</p>  <p>Thank you</p>
