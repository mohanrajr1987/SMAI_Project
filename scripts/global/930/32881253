<p>I have a form in datasheet view, on which the first column displays the autonumber primary key of the records displayed. </p>  <p>This field appears as a hyperlink which is used to open a form to manipulate the data of the record. </p>  <p>I would like this hyperlink to open one of two different forms, depending on whether a particular field is null or not.</p>  <p>This is the code I use to open the form to the relevant record</p>  <pre><code>Private Sub ISP_ID_Click()      TempVars.Add "CurrentRecord", ISP_ID.Value     DoCmd.OpenForm "frmModifyISP", acNormal, "", "[ISP_ID]=[TempVars]![CurrentRecord]", acEdit, acNormal  End Sub </code></pre>  <p>I would like to open a form named "frmModifyISP_Address" if a field called "AddressID" for the current record is not null.</p>  <p>Any help with this would be greatly appreciated.</p>
