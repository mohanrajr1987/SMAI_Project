<p>I have two tables, tblTasks and tblOffsets. The tblTasks has all of these Tasks that are being funded and tblOffsets has references to lines in tblTasks that are being funded by outside money. </p>  <p>Both have the same columns except tblOffsets has an extra column called "Source" to keep track of where the money is coming form.</p>  <blockquote>   <h2>Columns</h2>      <p>Appropriation, PerformerGroup, Performer, Contract, ID, IDExt, Labor, Material, Travel, FiscalYear</p> </blockquote>  <hr>  <p>The primary key is actually a collection of columns from this table: Appropriation, PerformerGroup, Performer, Contract, FiscalYear, ID, and IDExt. Each row has a unique combination of these columns.</p>  <p>Now what I want to do is get a subquery (or maybe I need to make a new table?) that takes tblTasks and subtracts the values from tblOffsets for the lines that exist in tblOffsets.</p>  <p>I've tried to write this code that obviously doesn't work but it should give you an idea of what I'm talking about:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT  tb.Appropriation, tb.PerformerGroupID, tb.PerformerID, tb.Contract, tb.ID, tb.IDExt, (tb.Labor - o.Labor) AS Labor, (tb.Material - o.Material) AS Material, (tb.Travel - o.Travel) AS Travel  FROM tblTaskBooks tb, tblOffsets o  WHERE tblTaskBooks.Appropriation = tblOffsets.Appropriation AND   tblTaskBooks.PerformerGroupID=  tblOffsets.PerformerGroupID  AND   tblTaskBooks.PerformerID = tblOffsets.PerformerID  AND   tblTaskBooks.Contract = tblOffsets.Contract AND   tblTaskBooks.ID = tblOffsets.ID AND   tblTaskBooks.IDExt = tblOffsets.IDExt AND   tblTaskBooks.FiscalYear = tblOffsets.FiscalYear </code></pre>  <p>When I do this however, Access keeps asking for an input for Appropriation and etc. Is the problem that the two tables have different number of rows?</p>
