<p>I have an MS Access Database program that brings in the data from an MS Excel workbook (it's only one sheet) that is then processed and kicks out a completed form for the user. </p>  <p>The whole thing was working fine, but when they encountered an error in the report I went to work with the database program to find the problem and a new one cropped up. MS Access is only importing cells A1 and A2. </p>  <p>When I try to manually import the Excel file and append to a table, the Import Wizard only shows those two cells as being included in the file. Somehow, MS Access is not seeing the entire sheet of data. </p>  <p>I have tried manually changing the acSpreadsheetType option in DoCmd.TransferSpreadsheet and it worked once. I have also tried changing it programmatically with no effect (i.e., I still only get cells A1 and A2). </p>  <p>Here is the segment of the VBA that deals with this part of the program: </p>  <pre><code>Dim acSpreadsheetType As Integer  strFile2Import = txtFindFile  acSpreadsheetType = ExcelVersion(strFile2Import)  DoCmd.Hourglass (HourglassOn) DoCmd.SetWarnings (WarningsOff)  DoCmd.RunSQL _     "DELETE tbl_Work_Plan_Item_Import.*, * " &amp; _     "FROM tbl_Work_Plan_Item_Import;"  DoCmd.TransferSpreadsheet _     acImport, acSpreadsheetType, "tbl_Work_Plan_Item_Import", strFile2Import, True </code></pre>  <p>and here is the "ExcelVersion" function: </p>  <pre><code>Public Function ExcelVersion(ByVal strFile2Import As String)     'https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/ff840717.aspx     'https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/ff198017.aspx     Set objapp = CreateObject("Excel.Application")     objapp.Visible = True     Set wb = objapp.workbooks.Open(strFile2Import, True, False)     ExcelVersion = wb.FileFormat     wb.Close      objapp.Quit      Set objapp = Nothing      Select Case ExcelVersion         Case 29             'xlExcel3 (Excel3)             ExcelVersion = 0    'acSpreadsheetTypeExcel3 (Microsoft Excel 3.0 format)         Case 33             'xlExcel4 (Excel4)             ExcelVersion = 6    'acSpreadsheetTypeExcel4 (Microsoft Excel 4.0 format)         Case 39             'xlExcel5 (Excel5)                             'xlExcel7 (Excel7)             ExcelVersion = 5    'acSpreadsheetTypeExcel5 (Microsoft Excel 5.0 format)                                 'acSpreadsheetTypeExcel7 (Microsoft Excel 95 format)         Case 46             'xlXMLSpreadsheet (XML Spreadsheet)             ExcelVersion = 10   'acSpreadsheetTypeExcel12Xml (Microsoft Excel 2010 XML format)         Case 50, 51         'xlExcel12 (Excel12)                             'xlWorkbookDefault (Workbook Default)             ExcelVersion = 9    'acSpreadsheetTypeExcel12 (Microsoft Excel 2010 format)         Case 56             'xlExcel8   (Excel8)             ExcelVersion = 8    'acSpreadsheetTypeExcel8 (Microsoft Excel 97 format)                                 'acSpreadsheetTypeExcel9 (Microsoft Excel 2000 format)     End Select  End Function </code></pre>  <p>"strFile2Import" and "txtFindFile" are the file name and full path to be imported that are gotten from a File Dialog box. </p>  <p>My original program didn't have the ExcelVersion function and I had hardcoded acSpreadsheetType as "acSpreadsheetTypeExcel12XML" and when I changed that to "acSpreadsheetTypeExcel9" it worked correctly once. </p>  <p>What am I missing? </p>  <p>For the record, I have also tried doing a .recalc and .requery to the entire form after performing the import, and that was unsuccessful as well. </p>  <p>Any help you guys can throw my way would be greatly appreciated!</p>
