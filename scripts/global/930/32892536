<p>I'm extremely new to SQL, so I don't really know what I'm doing!</p>  <p>I would like a query to display the most recent review taken by each client, so after research; I found the following question: </p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17164299/access-sql-query-find-the-most-recent-date-entry-for-each-employee-for-each-tra">Access SQL Query: Find the most recent date entry for each employee for each training course</a></p>  <p>I then modified the answer to fit my scenario, by naming my tables and fields - giving me this:</p>  <pre><code>    SELECT t1.*, t2.*     FROM          Clients t1, Reviews t2          INNER JOIN          (             SELECT Reviews.[Review ID], Clients.[Client ID], Clients.[Title], Clients.[First name], Clients.[Surname, MAX(Reviews.[Review date]) AS MaxDate              **FROM** Reviews, Clients             GROUP BY Reviews.[Review ID], Clients.[Client ID]         ) t3             ON t1.[Client ID]=t3.[Client ID]              AND t2.[Review ID]=t3.[Review ID]              AND t2.[Review date]=t3.MaxDate </code></pre>  <p>But when I run it, I get a syntax error in the FROM clause. I have bolded the clause.  For my query, I want this displayed:</p>  <pre><code>Review ID....Client ID....Title....First name....Surname....Review date 1            1            Mr       Gerry         Parker     05/10/2015 3            2            Mrs      Georgina      Phillips   22/04/2016 </code></pre>  <p>When actually an older review by Georgina Phillips exists, the query should only display the newest or most recent review for all clients. I just need review dates to show, not the actual review data.</p>  <p>Each client can have multiple reviews, but each review can have only one client.</p>
