<p>Basically, I want to run a query to pull data entered into a VB form (specifically MONTH and YEAR).</p>  <p>This is what I currently have:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT * FROM orders WHERE MONTH(date_ordered) = ? AND YEAR(date_ordered) = ? ; </code></pre>  <p>When I run this in my database, it doesn't work. I get no results.</p>  <p>However, if I put it like this:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT * FROM orders WHERE MONTH(date_ordered) = 08 AND YEAR(date_ordered) = 1989; </code></pre>  <p>It works fine and pulls the expected results. Obviously, as I am using a form where the user is supposed to input the 'month' and 'year' themselves, this makes things a bit tricky. </p>  <p>What am I missing here? Cheers for any thoughts.</p>  <p>Note: the date_ordered field is a Date/Time field with a Short Date format.</p>
