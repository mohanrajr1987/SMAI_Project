<p>I have the following query in Access:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT Field1, Field2, Field3, "2015" As TestYear FROM Table1 </code></pre>  <p>I use this query in SQL Server Import/Export tool to get data from Access database into SQL Server database.</p>  <p>I keep getting an error: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>"(SQL Server Import and Export Wizard)</p>      <p>Error 0xc002f446: Data Flow Task 1: An error occurred while setting up a binding        for the "TestYear" column. The binding status was "DT_NTEXT". The data flow column type is "DBBINDSTATUS_UNSUPPORTEDCONVERSION".         The conversion from the OLE DB type of "DBTYPE_IUNKNOWN" to the destination column type of "DBTYPE_WVARCHAR" might not be supported by   this provider.</p> </blockquote>  <p>The destination table column for TestYear is of type  nvarchar.</p>  <p>I checked the source in my import package and the column is shown as LongText. I am not sure why since the column's length is only 4. </p>  <p>Can anyone please help me fix the problem?</p>
