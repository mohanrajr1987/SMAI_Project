<p>Working on a project in a Microsoft Access Database, I'm wondering- Exactly when is data written/saved to a database?  </p>  <p>As some background, we (being the users) have a shared database (.accdb format) that we modify via various forms.  When exporting the appropriate queries (via VBA), the data doesn't seem to be updated immediately.  I'm no stranger to the "Delayed Write Failed" error, and was wondering if this could be related to the timing issues.  My suspicions:  </p>  <ol> <li>The data writes after the current user closes the database  </li> <li>The data writes after all users are closed out of the database</li> <li>It's an unrelated error and I'm going wrong elsewhere</li> </ol>
