<p>I have multiple tables in Access; which, are loading lists for various air craft's catering areas on packing lists.</p>  <p>The packing lists have columns; which, contain position, items that go in that position, quantities of items, updates for that position</p>  <p>Each aircraft's packing list is determined by mileage, city pair and flight time.</p>  <p>There are approximately thirty aircraft, each having about 10-20 packing lists each(depending on the mileage, city pair and flight time). </p>  <p>What I want to do is import our packing lists, and compare them to the third party airlines packing lists to make sure they match.  The third party client often changes items in positions, and it is impossible for us to manually check each aircraft packing list to make sure they match.  </p>  <p>I'm trying to figure out a way to do a mass cross reference of the client's packing lists to ours, to make sure things match.  </p>  <p>Right now we are going by change notices from the client and pulling position updates by 'effective date' from their system, but sometimes they make updates without telling us or making notations on their packing lists, and we get tickets because things don't match.</p>  <p>I hope that is clear.  Please let me know if it's not, and I'll adjust the explanation.</p>
