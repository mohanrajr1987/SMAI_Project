<p>Using Access 2013 I have a calculated a column in a query that is the <code>datediff</code> from a clients intake date to <code>now()</code>, the formula is: </p>  <pre><code>DateDiff("d",[table1]![intake_date],Now()) </code></pre>  <p>So the column will give the total number of days the client has been our client. This works great. Each client has a total number of days populated. Now what I want to do is add those numbers up to find the total number days from that column. What I can't figure out is how to get a sum of that column to populate in a textbox. I have a form with a textbox that I want to sum to show in. The formula I assumed would work is </p>  <pre><code>=Sum([queryname]![columnname])  </code></pre>  <p>but that is not working. </p>
