<p>Split out from another thread:</p>  <p>I'm an access developer of many years standing considering moving to WPF and trying to understand the differences between the two environments - things I've been doing for years in Access are not so obvious to me (at the moment) in WPF.</p>  <p>In WPF there does not appear to be the equivalent to the Access subform control or equivalent to the Access continuous form, both of which I use extensively. Are these functionalities available in WPF or does it required coded workarounds?</p>  <p>Also, there doesn't appear to be any form of reporting available (to generate invoices/dockets/labels etc) which my clients usually require. What is the recommended way of handling this?</p>  <p>Any recommended reading or resource sites much appreciated!</p>  <p>many thanks in advance</p>
