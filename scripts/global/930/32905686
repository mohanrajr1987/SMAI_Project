<p>In Access I Use this dummy table(table1) and I want  to update a field of the table2 with the logic displayed below. Eg for ID=1 all the values of field2 in table2 should have the value 10 while the Date is &lt;1/1/2015 and all the values after that date should have the value 8 and so on. </p>  <pre><code>Table1 ID    field1      reviewDate 1        10       1/1/2014     1        8        1/1/2015 2        5        3/3/2013 2        6        4/4/2014 2        4        5/5/2015  Table2 ID    field2     Date  1     10         1/1/2014  1     10         2/1/2014  .       .          .  .       .          .  1      8         1/1/2015 </code></pre>  <p>I've tried a select statement instead first to see how close I am to the desired results and it is the following:</p>  <pre><code>select a.ID, field1, max(reviewDate) as max , b.Date  from table1 a   inner join table2 b  on a.ID=b.ID  and b.Date &gt;=a.reviewDate group by ID,field1,reviewDate,Date  order by a.ID,b.Date </code></pre>  <p>The problem obviously is that when the Date is greater than both the reviewDates of the same ID returns both values for the same Date. I want only the contemporary. eg for ID=1 on the date=2/1/2015 field2=8 only but in my script for the Date=2/1/2015 I have two records 10 and 8.</p>
