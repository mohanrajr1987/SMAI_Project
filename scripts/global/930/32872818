<p>we have 2 Access files that have linked tables from SharePoint. Some people do not always have an internet connection. Some of them have less PC skills and cannot handle SharePoint synchronization. </p>  <p>Therefore I want to prevent enetering data into linked tables by checking with VBA wether a connection to SharePoint is established. If there is no connection the Access file will close automatically. </p>  <p>How can I do that? I tried to enter some data into an linked dummy table and checked if the ID is negative. The problem with that solution is that the person has to push to the 'SharePoint sync' button to establish a connection or has to wait several minutes to connect automatically.</p>  <p>Thank you in advance</p>
