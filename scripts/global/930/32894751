<p>I have a database built by total morons. They did not use any relationships at all and put everything into one table. They asked me if I could extract some useful informations out of it and clean it up. </p>  <p>Say I have a table called "MEMBERS", one of the columns in that table is "Email addresses". </p>  <p>In this column all the emailadresses are split by semicolons, so a possible input could be: </p>  <p><em>lala@lalaland.com; ronny@ronnywebs.com; tomato@pulpketch.up</em> </p>  <p>whilst another could be just </p>  <p><em>irule@theworld.com</em></p>  <p>What I want to do now is make a new table "EMAILS" and a table "EMAIL-MEMBERS", as I need a many-to-many relation (members can have the same parents, so the same email adresses, members also can have 4 emails).</p>  <p>The only data I got is the messed up email column. I have to do this not only for emails, but for phone numbers aswell, but I guess that doesn't really matter as the method will be the same.</p>  <p>Anyone got an idea about how to create a custom query or macro which <em>splits</em> a column into multiple new records in another table, whilst creating new ones to indicate the relation and with the EMAILS table having a unique email column (so no insert if the email already exists)? Manual is also not an option. It's a member database containing about 4000 records. Hell no.</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
