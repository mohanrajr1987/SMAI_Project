<p>(insert typical I'm a noob comment and a million apologies for asking a noob question)</p>  <p>I'm trying to simplify a query where I'm trimming a set of data. I've created a WHERE statement from all the other OR statements to be based off of. The issue I'm having now is not repeating the base WHERE statement for each OR condition. </p>  <p><strong>What I'm having to do:</strong></p>  <pre><code>WHERE ((base conditions) AND X) OR  ((base conditions) AND Y) OR ETC..... </code></pre>  <p><strong>What I want to do</strong></p>  <pre><code>WHERE ((base conditions) OR X OR Y) </code></pre>  <p>I'm thinking I can set up the base conditions and then query the base condition with OR statements but I don't know if that's what I'm suppose to do. </p>  <p>Thanks in advance! </p>
