<p>So I have a database of mechanical components. I have a search form in the database that allows the user to apply filters to a query (through the use of 5 text/combo boxes and an "apply filters" button). This query will contain the components that made it past the filter, and some details about those components.  Also on the search form, I have a sub-report that is bound to the query.</p>  <p>My plan is to have the user filter though the data using the controls on the form. As the user filters out components, the report should update to display what components pass the new query. They would then select the component they are interested in by clicking on a record in the report, and that component ID would be passed into VBA to do more stuff.</p>  <p>My problem is that the report bound to the query will not update as the query does.  I have tried using DoCmd.Requery and Me.Form.Refresh on the button click event, but haven't gotten anywhere. It only works if I close the form, then re-open it. </p>  <p><strong>How do I get my bound report to change dynamically as the user modifies the SQL of its source query?</strong> </p>  <p>Here's my click event code:</p>  <pre><code>Private Sub cmdApplyFilters_Click() Call updateSearchFilters Me.Requery Me.Form.Refresh End Sub </code></pre>  <p>Here's my sub to update the query:</p>  <pre><code>Public Sub updateSearchFilters() Dim strSQL As String Dim searchQryDef As DAO.QueryDef  strSQL = searchSQLstrBuilder(Forms("frmSearch").tboCompID, Forms("frmSearch").tboDesc, Forms("frmSearch").cboType, Forms("frmSearch").cboVendor, Forms("frmSearch").tboVendPN) Set searchQryDef = CurrentDb.QueryDefs("qrySearchRes") searchQryDef.SQL = strSQL End Sub </code></pre>  <p>Here's my SQL string builder:</p>  <pre><code>Public Function searchSQLstrBuilder(tboCompID As TextBox, tboDesc As TextBox, cboType As ComboBox, cboVend As ComboBox, tboVPN As TextBox) As String searchSQLstrBuilder = "SELECT tblDocs.compID, tblComponents.Desc, tblComponents.type, tblComponents.vend, tblComponents.vendorPN " searchSQLstrBuilder = searchSQLstrBuilder &amp; "FROM tblComponents INNER JOIN tblDocs ON tblComponents.numComp = tblDocs.numComp "  Dim strCompID, strDesc, strType, strVend, strVPN As String strCompID = tboCompID.Value strDesc = tboDesc.Value strType = cboType.Value strVend = cboVend.Value If IsNull(tboVPN.Value) Then     strVPN = ""     searchSQLstrBuilder = searchSQLstrBuilder &amp; "WHERE (((tblDocs.compID) Like '*" &amp; strCompID &amp; "*') AND ((tblComponents.Desc) Like '*" &amp; strDesc &amp; "*') AND ((tblComponents.type) Like '*" &amp; strType &amp; "*') AND ((tblComponents.vend) Like '*" &amp; strVend &amp; "*') AND ([vendorPN] Is Null Or (tblComponents.vendorPN) Like '*" &amp; strVPN &amp; "*'));" Else     strVPN = tboVPN.Value     searchSQLstrBuilder = searchSQLstrBuilder &amp; "WHERE (((tblDocs.compID) Like '*" &amp; strCompID &amp; "*') AND ((tblComponents.Desc) Like '*" &amp; strDesc &amp; "*') AND ((tblComponents.type) Like '*" &amp; strType &amp; "*') AND ((tblComponents.vend) Like '*" &amp; strVend &amp; "*') AND ((tblComponents.vendorPN) Like '*" &amp; strVPN &amp; "*'));" End If  End Function </code></pre>  <p>Thanks in advance!  Let me know if there's more information I can provide.</p>
