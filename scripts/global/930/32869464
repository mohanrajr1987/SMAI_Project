<p>I've created a form that allows users to select multiple parameters to run a query following the procedure here: <a href="http://www.fontstuff.com/access/acctut08.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fontstuff.com/access/acctut08.htm</a></p>  <p>Now I'm wondering if it is possible to add a third click box that is yes/no indicating if they want to export this query to excel versus just seeing the results in access.  Multiple users will be using this form, so I cannot have it export to a static location. It looks like <code>DoCmd.TransferSpreadsheet</code> might be what I am looking for if the option is yes, but I'm not sure how to make it user defined.  Any points in the right direction would be greatly appreciated.</p>  <p>EDIT: I've figured it out.  Below is how I did it.  I kept getting an error that something wasn't defined, and it turns out I needed to go into references in the VBA editor and tick "Microsoft Office 14.0 Object Library" to make it work.</p>  <p>This is the click buttons code:</p>  <pre><code>Private Sub cmdOK_Click() 'This is if the combo box is checked as Yes.  I set it up for only two options, 'that way it can't be messed with. If comExcel = "Yes" Then     DoCmd.TransferSpreadsheet acExport, 10, "Current Pricing", saveFileAs, True     DoCmd.Close acForm, "Current Pricing" Else DoCmd.OpenQuery "Current Pricing", acViewNormal, acEdit DoCmd.Close acForm, "Current Pricing" End If End Sub </code></pre>  <p>This is the module code for "saveFileAs"</p>  <pre><code>Function saveFileAs(Optional iFilename As String = "Current Pricing") As String Dim fd As FileDialog, fileName As String  On Error GoTo ErrorHandler  Set fd = Application.FileDialog(msoFileDialogSaveAs)  'Set initial filename fd.InitialFileName = iFilename  If fd.Show = True Then     If fd.SelectedItems(1) &lt;&gt; vbNullString Then         fileName = fd.SelectedItems(1)     End If Else     'Stop Code Execution for Null File String     End End If  saveFileAs = fileName  'Cleanup Set fd = Nothing  Exit Function  ErrorHandler: Set fd = Nothing MsgBox "Error " &amp; Err &amp; ": " &amp; Error(Err)  End Function </code></pre>
