<p>I would like to create an mdb access file and populate it all in memory and spit it back out to the UI for users to download locally, but I can't see anyway around first having to specify a physical location for the mdb when trying to create it. Is it possible? I am able to create recordsets in memory but I can't seem to create an mdb access file from that record. Maybe converting to XML first?</p>
