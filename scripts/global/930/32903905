<p>I have a Union query with invoice data like invoice number, supplier and so on. This query is created for the purpose of providing credit note information.</p>  <p>My problem arise when I would like to provide exchange rate for invoices in different currencies. If there is for example RON currency, I need to check currency and date of invoice and then provide value from another table.</p>  <p>I stored currencies and their values in another database. I wanted to use Dlookup function but it works only current database. Not sure what can I do. Is VBA needed here or it can be avoided?</p>  <p>Edit: Having problem with syntax:</p>  <p>Query:</p>  <pre><code>SELECT [Faktury - E100 od nich].InvoiceNumber, [Faktury - E100 od nich].InvoiceDate, [Faktury - E100 od nich].InvoiceCountry, [Faktury - E100 od nich].Currency, DLookUp("Value","Tabela1","Currency1 =" &amp; [Currency]) AS Wyr1 FROM [Faktury - E100 od nich]; </code></pre>  <p>Dlookup syntax:</p>  <pre><code>DLookUp("Value";"Tabela1";"Currency1 =" &amp; [Currency]) </code></pre>  <p>Query has column with <code>Currency</code> used in invoice and <code>Tabela1</code> has <code>Currency1</code> and <code>Value</code>. I get error or no value is shown...</p>
