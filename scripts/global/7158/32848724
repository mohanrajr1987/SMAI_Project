<p>I am trying to learn callback, and after I read eloquent JS, it introduces callback as this format which Im not familiar with and it didn't explain how it works: </p>  <pre><code>var merge = function(array1, array2, callback){     var result = [];   for (var i = 0; i &lt; array1.length; i++) {    result[i] = array1[i] + array2[i];   }; callback(result)  };  merge([1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], function(merged) {console.log(merged)}); </code></pre>  <p>but after I learned from code school, I tried to rewrite the format to this one: </p>  <pre><code>var merge = function(array1, array2, callback){     var result = [];   for (var i = 0; i &lt; array1.length; i++) {    result[i] = array1[i] + array2[i];   }; return function() {console.log(result)} };  merge([1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8])(); </code></pre>  <p>im not sure if the way I understand call back is correct, but my rewrite works and shows the same result...can anyone explain to me how the first call back format works?</p>
