<p>I am pretty new at android/java development and I am trying to process onClick events in an array of view from a "library" class but I can't figure out how it should work.</p>  <p>What I have so far is :</p>  <p>For the library :</p>  <pre><code>public class WordArea {     private ImageView[] imageViewArray;     public boolean createWordTemplate(Activity myActivity, int layoutId, int numberOfLetters, int[] imageArray) {     imageViewArray = new ImageView[10];      // .....      for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {     // ...         imageViewArray[i].setClickable(true);         layout.addView(imageViewArray[i], params);          imageViewArray[i].setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {          public void onClick(View v) {                  thisIsWhereIwouldLikeTheCallbackToWork( v );         }     }); </code></pre>  <p>Then in my activity class I am defining objects like this :</p>  <pre><code>private WordArea myWordArea = new WordArea(); </code></pre>  <p>And I would like to define in the activity class the method to be called by the setOnClickListener</p>  <p>Can anyone please help me with the code I should put in the library and in the activity class to make it work ?</p>
