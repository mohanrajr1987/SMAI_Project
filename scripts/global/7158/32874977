<p>I am learning call back functions, but I am confused of the syntax for the below two functions. they are all giving the same result, but written in different syntax, however, why the first one doesn't need to "return result" but the second one does? is that because the "callback(result)" already returned the function and there is no need to return? but for the second merge function, since the callback is on"array1[i], array2[i]", the result need to be returned? </p>  <p>Please correct me if my understanding is not correct. thanks.</p>  <pre><code>var merge = function(array1, array2, callback){     var result = [];   for (var i = 0; i &lt; array1.length; i++) {    result[i] = array1[i] + array2[i];   }; callback(result)  };  var x=merge([1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], function(merged) {console.log(merged)}); </code></pre>  <hr>  <pre><code> var merge = function(array1, array2, callback) {   var result = [];    for (i=0; i &lt; array1.length; i++) {     result[i] = callback(array1[i], array2[i]);      }   return result; };  var x = merge([1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], function(a, b){     return a + b; }); console.log(x); </code></pre>
