<p>I just read the book "JavaScript: The Good Parts".<br> And there was an example in the Callback function part<br> <br> bad way:</p>  <pre><code>   request = prepare_the_request();     response = send_request_synchronously(request);     display(response); </code></pre>  <p>recommended way:</p>  <pre><code>request = prepare_the_request(); send_request_asynchronously(request, function(response){     display(response);   }): </code></pre>  <p><br> The problem is i can't understand the difference and the effect taken by the bad way example.<br> Could anyone explain it in easy way?</p>
