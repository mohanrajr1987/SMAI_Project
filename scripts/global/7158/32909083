<p>I have an issue in calling calculation function from back end. The process is when we enter in certain <code>Id</code> in certain state a grid is opened with many text-fields.</p>  <p>Each time when i change a field a calculate function is called from back end <strong>before clicking on submit</strong>. Now i have added a mandatory flag for few <code>text-fields</code>.Now when i enter in that mandatory sate which has few <code>text-fields</code> as mandatory which makes ur submit button disabled until it is <code>true</code>. </p>  <p>But now when I change any <code>text fields</code> i can not get the <code>calculation function</code> from back end until that <strong>validation is satisfied</strong>. </p>  <p>My problem is how to make the calculation function to be called every <code>text field</code> no matter if I'm in flag state or un-flagged state?</p>
