<p>Something strange happens: I didn't modify any part of my ns3 c++ code, and running a compilation this is the error that appear: </p>  <pre><code>[ 815/1681] cxx: scratch/initial-scenario.cc -&gt; build/scratch/initial-scenario.cc.1.o In file included from ../scratch/initial-scenario.cc:3: In file included from ./ns3/core-module.h:18: In file included from ./ns3/calendar-scheduler.h:24: In file included from ./ns3/scheduler.h:25: In file included from ./ns3/object.h:29: In file included from ./ns3/object-base.h:23: In file included from ./ns3/type-id.h:25: In file included from ./ns3/trace-source-accessor.h:24: ./ns3/callback.h:1244:54: error: expression with side effects will be evaluated despite being used as an operand to 'typeid' [-Werror,-Wpotentially-evaluated-expression]                         "got=" &lt;&lt; Demangle ( typeid (*other).name () ) &lt;&lt; std::endl &lt;&lt;                                                      ^ ./ns3/fatal-error.h:98:32: note: expanded from macro 'NS_FATAL_ERROR'       std::cerr &lt;&lt; "msg=\"" &lt;&lt; msg &lt;&lt; "\", ";           \                                ^ 1 error generated. </code></pre>  <p>I don't understand why this error come out. The strange thing is that I'm working with two similar codes in two different directories and the error appear in both but I didn't modify anything. Could be a problem of the compiler? Any suggestion? </p>
