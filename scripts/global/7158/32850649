<p>A library that I am using has an Android activity. I would like to pass a callback to the activity to get notified of certain user events like when user enters a specific code or draws something on the screen. I am not able to find a way to pass callbacks to the android activity. </p>  <p><strong>Note:</strong> I can edit the library, however, I prefer to leave the activity within the library for architectural reasons and ease of testing without integrating with the larger app.</p>  <p>What is the best possible way to solve this? Are there any Android design patterns?</p>
