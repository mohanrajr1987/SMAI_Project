<p>I'm trying to get a callback function to fire after an Angular $http Post but I'm having no luck. My Post function is working, but not the callback. I see on Angular's site that <code>.success()</code> has been deprecated so I'm trying <code>.then()</code> but that doesnt seem to do anything either.</p>  <p>Can anyone please tell me what I'm missing? Thank you very much in advance. </p>  <pre><code>starwarsApp.controller('appController', ['$scope', '$http','$q', function($scope, $http,$q) {       $scope.addContact = function(){         $http.post('/jediList',$scope.jediEntered).then(function(response){             console.log('Why am I not being seen?');         });      };  }]); </code></pre>
