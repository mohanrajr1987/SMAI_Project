<p>I have a controller which is calling a service with <code>$this-&gt;get('app.service.myservice')</code> in many functions handling routes.</p>  <p>Instead of fetching that service systematically, I was wondering whether there is a way of being notified that the controller and the services have been created. I am looking some kind of callback in the controller's life's cycle.</p>  <p>I would then fetch the service once and store it in a variable with the controller.</p>
