<p>I am trying to do the homework but I can't figure how to continue from here. The assignment requires to design a calculator for controlling budget. Here are the requirements: </p>  <p>Have you ever been low on cash and couldnâ€™t go beyond a certain dollar limit when shopping? You sort of need a calculator in your head. It would be cool if a device was actually part of the cart and as you add an item into the cart it would increment your total counter. To solve this, we are going to write a program that keeps a tally of the amount that we have spent so far as we visit a store.</p>  <p>What Your Program Should Do:</p>  <ol> <li>Allow the shopper (user) to enter in the product name and the cost. This should be echoed and confirmed. Make sure to check for bad data.</li> <li>The user should be allowed to continue this until they want to check out.</li> <li>Your program needs to keep a running total.</li> <li><p>Upon checkout, the grand total should be displayed.</p>  <pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt; #include &lt;fstream&gt; #include &lt;string&gt; #include &lt;iomanip&gt;  using namespace std;  int item_info(float, char);  int main() {      //Declare all varibles.     char itemName[100];     float itemPrice;     char option;     float total;     int count;      count = 1;      // Setting decimal point for output.     cout.setf(ios::fixed, ios::floatfield);     cout.setf(ios::showpoint);     cout.precision(2);      item_info(itemPrice, itemName[100]);     total = total + itemPrice;      //Ask user if they want to continued to add more items.     cout &lt;&lt; "Do you want to add more items? (Y/N)";     cin &gt;&gt; option;      if (option == 'Y' || option == 'y')     {         item_info(itemPrice, itemName[100]);      }     else     {         cout &lt;&lt; "The total price of all items: $" &lt;&lt; total &lt;&lt; ".\n";     }      }  int item_info(float itemPrice, char itemName[100])     {     //Ask for input.     cout &lt;&lt; "Please enter the item name: ";     cin.get(itemName, '\n');      //Ask for the price of the item.     cout &lt;&lt; "Please enter the price of the item: ";     cin &gt;&gt; itemPrice;      //Check if it's a valid data.     while (!cin)     {         cin.clear();         cin.ignore(100, '\n');         cout &lt;&lt; "Invalid input! Please enter the item price:";         cin &gt;&gt; itemPrice;     }     //Only take necessary data.     cin.ignore(100, '\n');      //Confirm the user input.     cout &lt;&lt; "Item information:" &lt;&lt; itemName &lt;&lt;": " &lt;&lt; itemPrice &lt;&lt;"\n";     return itemPrice;     } </code></pre></li> </ol>  <p>Can someone tell me how to fix it ?</p>
