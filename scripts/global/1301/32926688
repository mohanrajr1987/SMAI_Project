<p>I have a requirement to make a simple Jquery ajax call to a web api that supports both client certificate and JWT Bearer authentication. </p>  <p>The api is hosted in IIS and IIS setting is to accept a client certificate but dose not require one. When i make a simple ajax call from UI the call is failing IE (10, 11) and it prompts for a certificate selection in chrome (weird as my understanding is that you can not send client certificate in a XHR request). </p>  <p>I just intend to make all the XHR call via JWT bearer authentication and not even have the client certificate selection popup. I have been stuck on this for two night and not able to make any head way :( </p>
