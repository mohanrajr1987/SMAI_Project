<p>So, I've been trying to bind Wowza media server to port 80 on our fail-over production server, and I'm encountering something else being bound to the port.</p>  <p>The process reports as 'System' with PID 4. After chasing myself around the web for a while, I found numerous indicators that it could be IIS, MSSQL, Microsoft's Web Deployment Service, or even the Branch Cache service. After exploring all of these options, as well as a couple more that relate specifically to this server, I can say that none of these are actually binding to that IP -- not intentionally anyway.</p>  <p>If I stop my IIS Server through the IIS manager, the port frees up - generally indicating to me that it is likely IIS. After rifling through my bindings somewhere around 6-8 times now, I can say beyond the shadow of a doubt, that none of the sites that I have defined are bound to this IP address. It also counts to mention that there is no longer a 'Default Site' - before that runs through anyone's head.</p>  <p>Further, I've run 'netsh http show servicestate' and combed through the list for any entries matching the problem IP, and have found none.</p>  <p>I've also changed the 'System/CurrentControlSet/Http/ListenOnlyList' registry entry, to no avail.</p>  <p>Does anyone have any other suggestions for locating whatever system process - related to or reliant on IIS - could have me spinning?</p>
