<p>I made a WEB app using ASP.NET-MVC with a local SQL server database. I have a lot of issues while trying to publish it.</p>  <p>I want to publish the web app on a MS 2003 server. I have tried to do it with the Publish tool on Visual Studio 2012 but it doesn't work, I had this error : <strong>ERROR_DESTINATION_NOT_REACHABLE</strong>, I searched for some solutions on the internet and found this :</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Diagnosis - Web Management Service or Remote Agent is not installed or   unreachable on the remote computer. Resolution - Verify that Remote   Agent Service or Web Management Service are started on the remote   computer, depending on which one you are connecting to. You can do a   "net start wmsvc &amp; net start msdepsvc" on the remote computer to   ensure these services are started. Also, ensure that a firewall is not   interrupting communications with the destination.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I have tried to install the <strong>Remote agent service</strong> on the MS server but it doesn't show up in the services lists.</p>  <p>I have also tried to publish the app locally using <strong>IIS</strong> (instead of running the app with the play button on VS studio), I have followed some steps in a forum and publish the package, I had this error : </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/VvYbU.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/VvYbU.png" alt="IIS Error"></a></p>  <p>My files are structured like that : </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/qeMOG.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/qeMOG.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Can anyone help, I am really stuck on this and I can't move on !</p>  <p>On the server I have :</p>  <p><strong>Windows server 2003</strong></p>  <p><strong>IIS 6.0</strong></p>  <p><strong>SQL Express 2005</strong></p>  <p>On the development machine : </p>  <p><strong>Windows 7</strong></p>  <p><strong>Visual studio 2012</strong></p>  <p><strong>IIS 7.0</strong></p>  <p><strong>ASP.NET-MVC 4</strong></p>  <p><strong>Sql Server 2008</strong></p>  <p>Any help is needed, thanks.</p>
