<p>I am working on AngularJs application with node.js. Using gulp, I have created (compiled) my application (<code>app</code> in below image) and got the following directories </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8gbhk.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8gbhk.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>Now I completely struck how to proceed next. I want to host this application over IIS to run and see the pages (in <code>views</code> folder) but I don't know how to host it on IIS.</p>  <p>I tried <a href="http://www.infragistics.com/community/blogs/dhananjay_kumar/archive/2015/02/13/how-to-use-nodejs-express-and-bower-to-create-angularjs-apps.aspx" rel="nofollow">this</a> article, but it guides to use express server. </p>  <p>The issue is, how IIS will figure out that the first page lies in <code>views</code> folder, and even if I use the complete url </p>  <pre><code>http://localhost:8078/views/index.html </code></pre>  <p>it shows me all angular code with brackets like <code>{{logginuser}}</code> etc</p>  <p>EDIT:  Do I need web.config file here or not. If yes then how I will define entry point to the application?</p>
