<p>Hi I am looking for the options by which image can be stored on server. Two of them are <br><code>1. Store image in file system.</code><br> <code>2. To store in sql server.</code><br>  We do have a mobile app which is using restful service to upload image. And when image to be displayed path of the image is passed to the app like "11.11.1.1.1/Pic/Man.jpg" in response. As our project require faster image upload and download we used file system approach. <br> <code>1. Is there any other alternative available to do image operations faster and secure?</code><br> <code>2. What can be the things which should be done to improve existing approach performance?</code><br> As images need to be displayed on mobile app. If network is running slow it may take a longer time to show image?</p>
