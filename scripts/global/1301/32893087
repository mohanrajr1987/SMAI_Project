<p>I am using IIS 7 and I have an Web Site called MySite. Within this site I have 3 Applications: Admin, Biz, Public. For these sites I'm using ASP.NET 4.5. Within the Admin site the user has the ability to upload images. After the upload is complete, the images are resized and stored on the file system.</p>  <p>What I would like to do is move these images over to the Application called Public. Is there a common and accepted practice for doing this?</p>  <p>Also, I should note that the Admin and Biz sites are fully secured, so I can't just create an URL that points to the path within the Admin.</p>
