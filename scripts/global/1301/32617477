I want to move all the code,classes and other infrastructure code from this project into the web project and remove this project from the build and install the 3rd party dlls the code in the class reference to be installed in the deployment server.

What is the best way to move the project , can I use resharper for this please help me.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance</p>
