<p>I'm getting an "The connection was reset." message when I'm trying to upload a .zip file to an FTP server. </p>  <p>I've built a custom web site for the project and everything works fine when uploading smaller files. 300mb or less. But when a larger file gets processed, it fails with above mentioned message. </p>  <p>I've set the Maximum allowed content length to 3990000000 bytes (3.99GB) and the maximum time out is set to 720 minutes. </p>  <p>Here is what I can see in the Web.config</p>  <pre><code>&lt;httpRuntime executionTimeout="43200" maxRequestLength="1048576" /&gt; &lt;sessionState mode="InProc" cookieless="false" timeout="720" /&gt; &lt;requestLimits maxAllowedContentLength="3990000000"&gt;&lt;/requestLimits&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I'm out of ideas at this stage as to what the problem might be, I've test in Firefox, chrome and IE and every time I try a file larger than 300mb, it fails. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated. </p>
