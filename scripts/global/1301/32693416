<p>I am developing a B2B that is now in production. The problem is that when I update the application on IIS  the html files of the template are not updated.  After I clear the cache of the browser everything gets updated.</p>  <p>How can I avoid IIS to cache the pages of the templates? Or more generally how can I do to always have the most recent server files?</p>  <p>Thanks  Matteo  </p>
