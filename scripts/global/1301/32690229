<p>I've legacy 32-bit COM component (Basically DLL) which has a dependency on msvbvm50.dll (In-build COM component in 32 bit windows). Now, I want to use this DLL in my code/application hosted on 64-bit windows 7.</p>  <p>As described in this and this, I tried using 32-bit tools (c:\windows\syswow64\regsvr32.exe) to register them to registry. I also made sure the entry exist in registry (using syswow64\regedit32.exe) at HKey_Classes_Root\Wow6432Node\CLSID[GUID] with AppID registered with DLL GUID and DLLSurrogate is enabled at HKey_Classes_Root\Wow6432Node\AppID[GUID]</p>  <p>However, The problem is - Whenever I try to use this component in my VBScript as</p>  <p>SET variable = CreateObject(DLLComponent.DLLObject)</p>  <p>My 'variable' value always comes as empty. Just to confirm, when try to locate the component using Process explorer, I couldn't find any of the DLLHost process running this component which suspect me that it is not loaded at first place.</p>  <p>Can anyone suggest where i'm going wrong? What additional steps i can perform to get this working or debugging for root cause?</p>  <p>FYI -</p>  <p>My Classic ASP application (Which is using VSScript to load this COM component) is hosted on IIS 7 in 64-bit Windows 7 Machine.</p>  <p>I also can't use WScript to know which architecture is being used, Since i'm using this script inside my ASP application. </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/MyRZm.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/MyRZm.png" alt=" Turing this on is not helping either since, I&#39;m using 64-bit ODBC driver to connect to the backend which reflect the conflict of Architecture for my application "></a></p>  <p>Turing this (Above) on is not helping either since, I'm using 64-bit ODBC driver to connect to the backend which reflect the conflict of Architecture for my application </p>
