<p>I have a little FTP client I'm writing for a job.  We're on a linux box - and the FTP server that I'm querying to is IIS 7.5.</p>  <p>What I'm running into, however, is that ftp_rawlist (which is what I want to use) isn't proffering up any more information than ftp_nlist does.  </p>  <p>Both produce:</p>  <pre><code>array(2) {   [0]=&gt;   string(54) "09-08-15  01:55PM               260187 firstdayvpk.jpg"   [1]=&gt;   string(48) "09-08-15  02:41PM            556373631 globe.psd" } </code></pre>  <p>The code works when I run it to query from another LAMP server (meaning it gives the expanded/more detailed results).  Does anyone have any IIS insight (which is the only thing I can imagine) that would cause ftp_rawlist to produce the same truncated results as nlist?</p>
