<p>Right now, i have my default website in my server. Here is the binding details</p>  <pre><code>Port : 80 HostName : (Blank) IP Address: * </code></pre>  <p>And then my custom Application</p>  <pre><code>Port : 80 Hostname : myPortal.com IP Address : * </code></pre>  <p>If I browse my application with myPortal.com, its coming up fine and I dont have any issues. Here is the Problem. For application availability purpose, i have four failover servers and the application is configured in the same way for each server. </p>  <p>If I want to browse my application with server name in order to find when one of the server is having issues, i m not able to do it</p>  <p>say for eg, if i browse, myPortal.com, its working but if i want to browse myserverA.com, its going to default website</p>  <p><strong>Approach 1 which i tried:</strong> To Overcome this issue, i made host name field as blank for my custom application and updated it with localhost for IIS Default website.  <strong>Doubt 1:</strong> It served my purpose but i scare if i have to host one more application in the server default port, i will be getting into trouble. Are there any best approach to solve this issue</p>  <p><strong>Approach 2 which i tried</strong> I left the host name as blank for Default Web site and had myPortal.com for my custom Application and then edited the IP address field for my custom Application. I changed the IP address from "All Unassigned" to "Server IP address"</p>  <p><strong>Doubt 2:</strong> It served by purpose of browsing my application with myPortal.com and myServer.com but what is the impact of changing the IP from "All unassinged" to "Specific Address"? Also, in future, if i host one more application in default port with different host name, how would i be accessing that server with server name or IP name?</p>
