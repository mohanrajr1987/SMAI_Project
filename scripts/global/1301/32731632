<p>My goal is to test my Web Application via the HTTPS connection accessible from another computer on my local network. I have already installed the <code>IIS Express Development Certificate</code> on the computer where I develop the application, so when I open my site from the Visual Studio using a URL as such:</p>  <pre><code>https://localhost:44234/MyWebApp/Index.aspx </code></pre>  <p>It opens in a web browser just fine.</p>  <p>I also exported &amp; then imported that <code>IIS Express Development Certificate</code> to another computer on the local network &amp; added it to <code>Certificates (Local Computer)/Trusted Root Certification Authorities</code> node.</p>  <p>But the issue is that to access this web app from another local computer (hosted in IIS) I have to use the host computer's IP, as such:</p>  <pre><code>https://192.168.1.234:44234/MyWebApp/Index.aspx </code></pre>  <p>but that creates the following cert warning in a web browser:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/56sL9.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/56sL9.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>  <p>So is there a way to make this work on another local computer?</p>
