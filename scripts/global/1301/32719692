<p>I have a new site named "testsite.txt.com" in IIS with port 8086 and created a new inbound rule in firewall to allow the the port and configured in host file as well . Now, when I tried to access the site(testsite.txt.com:8086) from another machine that is in same network it's throwing an error "ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED". </p>  <p>How to solve this issue? Did I missed any configuration? </p>
