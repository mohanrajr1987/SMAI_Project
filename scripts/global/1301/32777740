<p>I have a classic asp application running on both iis-6 and iis-7 at the same time</p>  <p>It load balanced between iis-6 and iis-7 (Horrendously Poor set-up I know)</p>  <p>I have been asked to make a small text change to the application. On an .asp page</p>  <p>If the app pool restarts the application takes a little while to restart. More than I can specify as a change window</p>  <p>I am aware of the numRecompilesBeforeAppRestart which defaults to 20. Is their a way to determine what number this is currently at?</p>  <p>And does operate uniformly between iis6 and iis7</p>  <p>Or is their a better way to manage text changes?</p>
