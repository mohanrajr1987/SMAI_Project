<p>The self-signed certificate feature in IIS on Windows 7 Ultimate only creates SHA1 certificates. I have tried creating my own certificate using makecert. However, there is a problem. makecert only creates a certificate usable for localhost, whereas the self-signed feature will create a certificate for my machine name. So for example, on my local box I hit <a href="https://MyMachine/default.aspx" rel="nofollow">https://MyMachine/default.aspx</a>, NOT <a href="https://localhost/default.aspx" rel="nofollow">https://localhost/default.aspx</a>. That is an important difference for me. Because of this Chrome complains about the domain not matching the certificate. </p>  <p>We have upgraded our production servers to use SHA2 certs. I would like my dev environment to match. Is there an upgrade to Windows 7 Ultimate or to IIS that fixes this? Or perhaps upgrading to Windows 10 fixes it?</p>
