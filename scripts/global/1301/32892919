<p>I need to redirect from</p>  <p><code>http://someserver/someapplication.page.aspx</code> to <code>http://someserver.domain.com/someapplication.page.aspx</code></p>  <p>Both the requests lead to the same server.</p>  <p><code>someserver/</code> works through our company's internal DNS</p>  <p>This is the same question as <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17046082/redirecting-to-full-domain">Redirecting to Full Domain</a></p>  <p>but I want an IIS solution for this, not code. My guess is it will have something to do with adding a httpRedirect add element in Configuration Editor using wildcards.</p>
