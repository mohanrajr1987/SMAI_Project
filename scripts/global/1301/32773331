<p>I am running VS 15 and I was able to run IIS Express from the <a href="http://localhost/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://localhost/index.html</a>  (no port numbers) just fine.  I had to remove the port numbers because a program I am testing does not handle port numbers in a localhost named website correctly.  This was working just fine.</p>  <p>I had to load IIS manager (and its components) so that I could create a SSL certificate request.  I did this successfully but now localhost(no port number) will not work for IIS Express.  I would like to use IIS Express locally but I need to run this project without port numbers.  IIS Express with a port numbers still works correctly.  </p>  <p>I removed IIS manager from my system using the "Windows Feature Manager".  Rebooted but I am still not able to <a href="http://localhost/" rel="nofollow">http://localhost/</a> for my project.  I receive a 404 error.  i think IIS must still hold a connection to that specific location for some reason.</p>  <ol> <li>How can I just get it to work again?</li> </ol>
