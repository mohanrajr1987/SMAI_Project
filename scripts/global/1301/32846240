<p>I have an ASP.NET 4.5 Webforms application that's been in production for several years now (started as a 2.0 app - now on .NET 4.5).</p>  <p>I added a WebAPI to the app, and on my own dev machine and our internal testing server, it works just fine.</p>  <p>Now putting it into customer's testing environment causes all our routes to fail with a HTTP 404 - not found. </p>  <p>Hmm..... is there anything I need to do in terms of configuring IIS 7 to make this work? It doesn't even work when I'm connected to the customer's test server using Remote Desktop, and trying to ping that URL....</p>  <p>Any ideas?</p>  <p><strong>Update for @codecaster:</strong></p>  <p>I'm setting up the two routes I need inside my code in the <code>Application_Start</code> method in <code>global.asax.cs</code>:</p>  <pre><code>// Route for the first method GlobalConfiguration.Configuration.Routes.MapHttpRoute("FirstRoute", "/myapi/someroute/{id}/{option}", new { Controller = "Controller1" });  // Route for the second method GlobalConfiguration.Configuration.Routes.MapHttpRoute("SecondRoute", "/myapi/secondroute/{operation}/{id}", new { Controller = "Controller2" }); </code></pre>  <p>(<em>with more meaningful names, of course - this is just for posting here</em>)</p>  <p><strong>Update #2:</strong></p>  <p>I removed the leading <code>/</code> on my routes, but I still don't get any results. Before the request even reaches my app, IIS intercepts it, tries to find a physical file for the path given, and the "StaticFile Handler" then complains that it cannot find that file.... <strong>duh!</strong> - it's not a <strong>static file</strong> - it's a WebAPI route, dumbo!</p>  <p>I cannot seem to figure out how to get this to work on IIS 7.0 - on our internal test server with IIS 8.5, it "just worked" without any changes.</p>  <p>I did check that I have the "extensionlessHandler" configured in my <code>web.config</code> - both in my <code>&lt;system.web&gt;</code> as well as my <code>&lt;system.webServer&gt;</code> sections - and I have the <code>targetFramework</code> on <code>&lt;httpRuntime&gt;</code> set to "4.5" :</p>  <pre><code>&lt;system.web&gt;         ....     &lt;httpHandlers&gt;         ....         &lt;add name="ExtensionlessUrlHandler-Integrated-4.0" path="*." verb="*" type="System.Web.Handlers.TransferRequestHandler" preCondition="integratedMode,runtimeVersionv4.0" /&gt;         ....     &lt;/httpHandlers&gt;     ....     &lt;httpRuntime targetFramework="4.5" /&gt;     .... &lt;/system.web&gt;  &lt;system.webServer&gt;     ....     &lt;httpHandlers&gt;         ....         &lt;add name="ExtensionlessUrlHandler-Integrated-4.0" path="*." verb="*" type="System.Web.Handlers.TransferRequestHandler" preCondition="integratedMode,runtimeVersionv4.0" /&gt;         ....     &lt;/httpHandlers&gt;     .... &lt;/system.webServer&gt; </code></pre>  <p>What more do I need to configure??</p>
