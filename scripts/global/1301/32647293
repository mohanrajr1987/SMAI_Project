<p>I've followed this instructions: <a href="https://www.sslshopper.com/article-how-to-create-a-self-signed-certificate-in-iis-7.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.sslshopper.com/article-how-to-create-a-self-signed-certificate-in-iis-7.html</a></p>  <p>On my local machine it worked fine. But when i tried to do the same on live server, certificate still is not trusted. Could someone help?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
